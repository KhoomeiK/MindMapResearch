That being said, narcissism is not considered a mental illness in the DSM-5. Is a personality disorder that cannot be treated with meds and therapy rarely works because they have to be honest and they won't be. They would have to really recognize that they have a problem and want to seek help for it but narcissists very rarely ever do that. They can sit in the therapist chair and lie through their teeth."
survivinginfidelity,falfpd7,t3_e9nta8,1576183604.0,"I was about to say that your soon-to-be-ex-husband sounds like a narcissist. They think they can do whatever they want and are surprised when they're hit with consequences. They do see consequences as punishment and in their mind it's like how dare they suffer consequences for anything that they do to people. I had the unfortunate experience of being with one for two years before I finally caught on to how he really is. I kept thinking maybe it was me and that if I fixed whatever I was doing to harm the relationship then maybe things would change but then I realized that nothing I ever did was good enough and it wasn't me.

That being said, not all cheaters feel like victims. He just happens to feel like one because he is a narcissist. I'm very sorry that that happened to you. You sound like you were a good wife to him and all I can say is hey it's his loss. I know that. That sounds like I'm trivializing what happened to you. I'm not trying to. Trust me I understand, I had Smoking Gun evidence on my ex that he was cheating and he still denied it and gaslighted me and called me crazy. I left about a week ago and I have not looked back since. I don't plan to either. He was physically, verbally, emotionally and financially abusive.

You said he was talking about possibly getting back together in the future, maybe in three years. Normally I would say what is he insane but we all know he clearly is and again narcissist think they can do whatever they want and have whatever they want with no consequences and they don't care how they get it. My ex was a terrible person who would step on whoever he had to running to get what he wanted regardless of whether it affected anyone else including his children. 

So be prepared for him to try to do what they call hoovering you back in which is to try to suck you back in with false promises changing. He's also going to do what they call love bombing you which is flattering you with compliments and telling you that he still loves you and wants to make it work etc. Do not fall for that shit. I did too many times. I know what you're going through in a way. I promise you it will get better but you have to leave him in the past and it sounds like you're ready to do that and I'm proud of you."

That could be a cover story because she realized she fucked up bad. Either way, you're doing the right thing. Your life would be a nightmare. She's a train wreck and you don't need her dragging you down with her. I couldn't see a future anymore either.

I know they tend to use their diagnosis as a get out of jail free card and the minute we stand up to them or call them out on anything and set boundaries we're accused of being unsupportive. You don't deserve anything she said or did to you. Manic or not, cheating is still cheating and how they treat us is unacceptable. 

My ex had no problem with talking to his exes all the time and keeping them on the back burner yet when I told him how it made me feel, I was accused of being jealous and insecure. I refuse to live like that. If someone needs to talk to their ex like that then I'm good on that. We're not an option. We should be their only choice or we shouldn't be there at all.

Anyway, sorry for hijacking your post. Just remember that you deserve better and I know you'll find her one day. My advice is to go no contact with her and anyone who knows her. Good luck with everything."

I really think she had an eating disorder. I have never seen anyone eat the way she could. What was a week's worth of food for a normal person would last her like 2 to 3 days. She went through a 30 pack of eggs in two days and would eat a half gallon of ice cream in less than 24 hours.

It used to piss me off because I would leave my house for a few days to go visit by now act and I would come home and have no food left even though I had just went grocery shopping. Then she would blatantly told me I ate your food while you were gone and not offer me any money to replace it. But yet when I said something to her, her attitude was basically oh well. I finally told her to stay the fuck out of my food and she told me that she would eat what she want whenever she wanted so I needed to just deal with it.

Trust me when I tell you that there is no working this out with these kind of people. They don't want to change anything because it benefits them. Why the fuck should they care because they don't have to pay for it. Tell her to stop eating your food and if she won't then demand money to replace it but I'm telling you right now neither one of those is white lie to happen.

UnsentLetters,f3eelwg,t3_dggshv,1570872519.0,Thank you for this. I'm 36 and I have muscular dystrophy. It makes it hard to walk long distances and forget crossing busy roads alone. People treat me like this all the time in public. I've learned to ignore it for the most part but it's still hard.

rant,f33gqhw,t1_f33gmdj,1570638293.0,I've just asked her not to come to my house and say it
rant,f33gfwl,t1_f33gdh5,1570638147.0,"No, I don't care if that's what she thinks I would just rather she didn't say it in front of me. Don't come to somebody else's house and expect them to follow your rules."
rant,f33g9ob,t1_f33fr5x,1570638056.0,"Okay fine I see your point but it just comes down to not everything that comes into somebody's head needs to also come out of their mouth. I guess maybe it kind of pissed me off because she's already opinionated and thinks that everybody that doesn't agree with her is wrong. 

I agree that our government is fucked up and people volunteer to fight their wars but still, she doesn't need to say it in front of me knowing I came from a large military family. It's like some things are just better left unsaid you know what I mean? But if you say anything to her that's in disagreement with what she said she loses her shit."
BipolarSOs,f33eion,t3_dfi9gv,1570637110.0,Don't. It's just going to be more of the same bullshit over and over. Save yourself the trouble. Speaking from experience.
rant,f33efz0,t3_dffxpl,1570637067.0,I know right and I've never understood those people who have speakers on the outside of their car. Who gives a fuck what you're listening to? You're obviously looking for attention and you've wasted a lot of money.
CPTSD,f1ni5jo,t1_f16y52u,1569617835.0,"Awww I'm sorry. Maybe a few friends have babies or when your kids get older, grandkids."
CPTSD,f15zrv3,t1_f15yutn,1569199267.0,Yes I do and the other one just kicked me LOL
BipolarSOs,f15wsai,t3_d7yawc,1569197708.0,I wondered the same thing while I was with my ex but now I don't care because he's my ex lol
CPTSD,f15wj8e,t3_d7x0s8,1569197581.0,I'm pregnant and read this totally differently from how you probably intended it but I guess it would still apply
AmItheAsshole,f15oy56,t3_d7sj4n,1569193667.0,YTA she got all dolled up for you because she wanted to look nice for you and instead of praising her efforts you made her feel like a hooker. Who gives a fuck what Strangers think of you? To be honest I wouldn't be surprised if she dumps you pretty soon.
jacksonville,f15j30c,t1_f15iuln,1569191263.0,I've tried them before. They said they don't help with my way. They only help if you're on a regular billing cycle. Thanks though.
unpopularopinion,f15c7y8,t3_d7qvef,1569187751.0,"I agree. I've grew up in a blue-collar family and I'm not exactly rich now however, I agree. Just because they're rich does not mean they're obligated to give their money away. And you're right, A lot of them worked really hard to get where they are but regardless of how they got the money, they are not obligated to give it to anyone. It's nice when they do but they are not obligated to help anyone. I dislike entitled people as well."
toastme,f15b7as,t3_d7qk5s,1569187314.0,Omg what?! What do you mean somewhat attractive? You are attractive. Don't ever think otherwise. I like your eyes and your hair as well.
jacksonville,f156ifs,t1_f154fzo,1569185448.0,Thanks. I'm hoping I can get some help because I looked it up and unfortunately if you are on my way you are not eligible for an extension. So it's like basically either pay us now or we cut you off.
justnosil,ezsd5el,t1_ezsc78p,1568087676.0,I'm sorry to hear that and no problem
justnosil,ezs8qhx,t1_ezryk8j,1568084895.0,It's a little late for that now because number one I'm 17 weeks on Wednesday and number two I don't believe in abortion except in cases of rape or incest. But it does suck that he can't really help much. Your sister-in-law sounds like a piece of work. Good luck with that. And I think that it's good that you realize that you deserve better and plan on leaving him if he can't stick up for you. I had an ex who was pretty much stuck to his mother's hip and finally I just realized that nothing was ever going to change and left. It sucks but trust me your life does get better.
AmateurRoomPorn,ezqys5p,t3_d1uh4e,1568065594.0,I love the cozy log cabin feel to it
