Generally less anxious and also feel just better overall. I still have lingering issues as a bpd diagnosis carries a lot of weight :/

I would definitely give yourself a chance with 15 first though, maybe for 90 days. Everyone reacts differently to different dosages...I didn't feel any real difference until 20mg regularly"

I feel happier, and can think we bit clearer. it's been 14 months since I first started with lexapro...I'd rather not be on it long term but I know going off it atm would be a mistake because I'm still dealing with several long term issues, in addition to a bpd and major depression diagnosis :)

Just keep in mind, everyone will respond differently and you won't know if 20mg is beneficial to you until you experiment with it. My goal is to start transitioning down to 15 mg in a few months, dependent on life circumstances of course."
