I’m not sure if this would help for men but try slugging (when you apply moisturizer then a thin layer of petroleum jelly... everyday though. Look for MD Complete. It helped me for the first few weeks to months to gather the skin back to repair it. Use it under the petroleum. I also recommend using gel cleaners with rounded beads in them, or without whichever your preference. A lot of these expensive products don’t be doing jack so save your money."

occult,fmgw3vu,t1_fmgs2ut,1586059415.0,Hi there nuclear science can you build more on this comment featuring Lilith? It’s quite fascinating .
occult,fmgv6fr,t3_fv469p,1586058691.0,your question and observation is completely valid and well thought out. I try to honestly hold myself back from letting people know nothing will come from a lot of this new age occultist nonsense. most people like to think there is no higher power and protecter of the keys  of wisdom. this is why it saddens me to see people using their “imaginations” to create all kinds of “occultism”... and to call themselves a god would honestly merit an eternal ass whooping unlike any other. thanks for the refreshing reminder that I’m not just being a nit picker.
Trufemcels,fjlxafv,t3_fdsmi8,1583456610.0,It’s quite interesting because the change in my skin has rendered me “not existing” amongst my own race and when I didn’t have skin issues people were halfway up my ass.. this honestly gives you the chance to know who you enemy is. I know that sounds dramatic but it’s really the case.

occult,f1ap7eb,t1_f1aoxmf,1569301253.0,"well.. discernment is key when working within this. it honestly depends on your full comprehension of the material you’re learning and alike, it’s source. for there are forces that will come in the forms of loved ones, friends and in disguise... but the stronger your psychic energy (and whichever major God or Goddess you choose to grant you protection) the more you attract the adversary.

Psychic,exs0m1w,t1_exs0iho,1566528927.0,meditation and visualization is required.

Psychic,exs089g,t3_cu1lo9,1566528628.0,It means that you’re subconscious is letting you know you need to step your vibration deeper into love. negative energies will try to influence you... especially when you’re sleeping. the light is trying to get through to your crown chakra (from you mentioning it coming down -in through your head-).. noticing your self worth and self love will change how people treat and see you in your waking life.
Psychic,exrmtx8,t1_exrkt96,1566519049.0,yes of course. we are made of up the elements as I’m sure you know.. you have to properly transmute these energies especially when they’re imminent.

SuicideWatch,exra9m0,t1_exr9zvz,1566513550.0,well... you’ll be exposed to super sensible astral energies that can manifest quite quickly in the 3D world... or you could safely interact with whoever and whatever and come back. it depends.
occult,exr9kf4,t3_cu2x2m,1566513195.0,very well done I agree. I’ve come to these realizations myself.
SuicideWatch,exr8qd2,t1_exqywl4,1566512907.0,such a beautiful response. and yes astral travel is real but it is also illusionary like this world so be careful.
SuicideWatch,exr8dmm,t3_cu2gx8,1566512720.0,"resonating here. I feel like my life path is to off things in the earthly plane too.. I had a failed attempt over a week ago..  I’m an empathic spiritualist so it troubles me to be in the world like this. I’m here for you if you’d like to talk. my birthday is on March 11th.. I think it’s pretty cool that yours is on the 22nd, it’s like half and half."
SuicideWatch,exr781n,t3_cu47ju,1566512285.0,I don’t think the mixture is strong enough. gotta go harder like heroin.
SuicideWatch,ex96m1i,t3_crrt8u,1566084296.0,I know how you feel. I had a failed attempt last week. Your whole story resonates... but I’m the female version.

SuicideWatch,ewpcrtq,t3_cp7rjg,1565638389.0,"
I just want to thank you and let you know how in time this came for me. I’ve decided and felt within my heart that these are my last days. my life mirrors your submission. And the painful truth of all this is that happiness is truly illusionary .. and no matter how much I “want” it, it’s not worth it. I experienced a smidge of who I used to be and realized the faux state of it all.. deceptive. how I was deceiving myself into believing other people cared or saw and felt me for me and not just my assets. I’m not hurting, or depressed.. I’m simply ready to take that next step back to nonexistence."
SuicideWatch,ewp9ihj,t3_cp8h7o,1565636362.0,the happier you are the more disillusioned your situation is. I agree with every letter of this submission.. as much as my ego wants to go back to life of illusions it’s just not “me” anymore. Checking out soon.
SuicideWatch,ewp8tvb,t1_ewp10iw,1565635942.0,I’m planning mine today too. having my last everything.

depression,evz1n7l,t3_clue8y,1564946740.0,I’ve oddly come to the same conclusion. I fantasize about my own death everyday. It becomes an increasingly decent place to be- madness. and then my mind goes back to the method and how eventually pull it off. you’re not alone.
depression,evz1h4p,t1_evxwop4,1564946620.0,shit you bussed my head open w this one.

dpdr,ev8hoco,t1_ev8hhtp,1564279894.0,the feeling of insanity is more real than the actual ‘disorder’ to me... the only reason these modes of thinking associating to your psychology occurs is because you’re not really ‘you’. I’ve learned this a long time ago.
SuicideWatch,ev8fv9t,t1_ev8fsfd,1564278345.0,yeah... so have I and I gotta say it’s probably the most annoying thing people can do.
