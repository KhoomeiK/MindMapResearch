 Every summer I proposed myself to 'learn as much as i could' just to get ready for the fall classes, but it never worked out lol. But what I learned was that it is MUCH more important to learn how to study effectively and to relax. So yeah, take a couple of courses but don't stress so much about it."

I know the goal is to be as ready as you possibly can, but if you focus on too many things at once, you may not really benefit from it. Especially in just 3 months of summer. So I suggest you focus on up to 3 topics and no more.

1. If you haven't done math in a while, start practicing algebra, and calculus.
2. Take a programming course in Java or python
3. Take a physics course

Everything else you will just learn as you go. No class is ever easy on electrical engineering so you will need to learn how to study and take things as they go..

&#x200B;

Many are suggesting to study so many topics or to start working on a raspberry pi project, etc. But IMO, if you don't have the topics down from the list above, you're just going to struggle through the program.. So you might as well focus on them. Do a project if you want, I just don't think is that crucial right now."
