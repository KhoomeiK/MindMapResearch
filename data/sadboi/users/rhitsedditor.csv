Unknown seeds, shipped to my pals uncle by accident so he planted them and grew them in his greenhouse (UK so not quite Cali-outside grow quality), first batch was worse than this tbh but probably because it was allowed to dry out for ages. this batch was probably picked around August/sept but I don't actually know, and is being trimmed by my guy who has never trimmed a marijuana plant in his life
