mentalhealth,fqbf8vk,t1_fpjvj20,1589235886.0,"Hi, I'm not really sure if you are open to continuing this conversation. I checked out your profile before deciding to reply and see that you have PTSD. I, too, have PTSD. I have plenty of experience in therapy and do know a fair amount about psychological testing. There are ways to approach an assessment of aspberger's syndrome and you can find more information on that at r/aspberger's. 

Also like you, I am a mother. A major focus of my therapy is how I act around and respond to my child since he is the most important thing in the world to me, which I'm sure you and I would see eye to eye on. This is obvious given the one piece of information that you are investing in your child's psychology. I know how difficult it is to have PTSD. In reading your most recent post, I am one of the very few people who can compassionately empathize with being set off just by seeing unwanted communication. ""Regular"" people don't deal with that; they get to move past it without searching for ways to fix the problems of the way other people act because it just doesn't get to them like it gets to us. We literally have demonstrable brain changes that are not our fault that bother us and which we will suffer from for our entire lives. 

If what we experience daily isn't tragic enough, I believe the bigger tragedy of  PTSD is ""intergenerational trauma,"" which has so well been documented that it is taken for granted. For example, just as it is taken for granted that children of depressed parents are more likely to become depressed from a mixture of genetic inheretence but also learned coping strategies (like resorting to staying in bed/not taking care of ones-self), it is taken for granted that children of parents with PTSD will not learn emotional self-regulation. They can't because we don't have it. The one thing that you and I might kill for - for example, not becoming irrationally upset by correspondence - is something that can only be taught, and it cannot be perfectly learned (as in, by adults) with a brain that wasn't properly developed or was changed by trauma (the over-active amygdala, larger thalamus, etc.). So of course our children are affected by our mental health. And their behavior shows it. 

My mother started having me assessed at the age of three and considered my having ""behavior problems"" my whole life. I now know that I was acting quite normally but was being responded to abnormally by someone who was struggling herself. She is in her sixties and while she is ""supportive"" of MY therapy, she is quite quick to claim she has no personal issues, although she behaves like I did just a few years ago, complains about sleep, has had relationships marked with instability and paranoia, etc. Three is when these problems typically start taking shape in very predictable patterns of behavior and it can be confusing because every kid develops otherwise at their own pace. Kids with PTSD parents tend to develop faster verbally, but that's just a population statistic, so not true for every kid. It is extremely difficult for most parents to hear (as I'm sure your own therapist would tell you) that they are part of the solution, which implies that they have created the environment that is a problem. My own therapist tells me stories of parents who simply never return, or yank their children out of therapy for feeling ""blamed."" There is no ""blaming"" someone who is simply that young child all grown up. I see it as taking responsibility for something my own mother didn't do (and couldn't -- she didn't have the awareness, support, nor tools!).

So all that is to say that my response was not to judge you. It was to say that I do get it. And also, by definition, most therapists are average. But returning to the premise that if you and I have our own mental health struggles (which are defined by behavior), it is only natural to conclude that they have an affect on our children, including their current and future diagnoses."

mentalhealth,fpj7y1x,t3_g9q28j,1588659307.0,"This type of situation is the cause of so much frustration for parents and adults alike. The problem is that there is actually no ""test"" for Asperger's; what psychologists can do is to observe behavior of the subject along with crucial information provided by the parent and possibly teachers.

What can be *extremely* uncomfortable for parents, and obviously confusing for adults is that the information coming from parents and teachers or just the ""intake"" information provided might be that the ""subject"" is obviously being treated as if there is something is wrong that isn't, or that the subject is coping in a normal way to an abnormal situation; in other words, the things that are in fact wrong are the environment and the subject is more intelligent or more intelligent in other areas than most people are.

Edit: I forgot to add that it only makes sense that it is a delicate subject to breach that perhaps the subject is not having a problem but that the system the subject he or she finds him or herself in is problematic. Of course any second, third, or nth opinion will be even more delicate about this fact if the patent or guardian only wishes to discuss the behavior of the subject as ""pathological."" 

This is all to say that a lot of kids grow up to find out that what their parents told them was wrong about them wasn't -- and that parents themselves have too difficult a time changing when their children aren't apparently behaving according to the"" normative"" society that *is not* being modeled at home. Same same with our children paying taxes, cleaning their yards (or even having one -- I don't), how about just saying and writing thank you letters? It's not expected that we are all perfect. What is great is parents who care when something looks off. What is best is parents who wonder what *they themselves* can model differently."

But if a psychopath doesn't value themself more than others or have personal  goals that they view as more important than others' volition/agency, then it's fine.

ptsd,fp2qt6o,t3_g9betk,1588266342.0,"I'm really sorry. My therapist worked with me for a long time on how to not get caught up in my abusive spouse's fights because they only serve to make things worse for you and the relationship (and I fell into the trap again yesterday -- dammit!).

Don't do it. As soon as you recognize that he is in a place where he is ""iffy,"" change the way you are responding to and expecting from him. He's a hurting person just like you are and your compassion for him is part of the solution for not allowing him to walk himself or to walk with him into an argument. So if your senses tell you that it's one of those conversations where anything might result in a fight, keep it light then end it quickly. ""I have to go"" is a valid reason and you do not owe him any explanations. If he ever asks, say ""something came up."" Not that you'll tell him later. ""Things are going on here"" is also good enough. If he says he's noticed that you have been ending your calls sooner than before, say you noticed that too. But you are not obligated to treat it as an issue or school him on boundaries. 

There is no need for arguing. If you find yourself doing that then you CAN disagree and then either say you will talk about it ""when we are calmer"" or ""he can be respectful"" or simply suggest that you should talk about it later since it's causing a fight and neither of you want that. But the key is that you do not need his concurrence to end the discussion. You just simply do it by saying goodbye and not responding to any texts that demand some kind of furtherance of the fight. Convo over."

ptsd,fp2oxm3,t3_g9b1g6,1588265447.0,"It's good to be aware of this tendency of yours. The answer is to keep boundaries and do things that make sense and are realistic for you. What you described is not abandoning if you need the space to stay healthy yourself; there's an old addage about needing to care for yourself before you *can* care for others. In philosophical thought experiments, you can ask yourself exactly how much money you are willing to donate: why only $5 today and not $10? Why not a recurring payment? Why not work for a charity directly? Why not move directly to where the need is? *The answer is yours to know* because you get to live your life and only you know how to live it in a way that you will feel good about it.

If you think being a good friend is doing x but not y, you don't owe anyone (especially not him or any friends who decide to comment) an explanation for it. There can be ""flying monkeys"" who get involved when someone is in need who feel they are emboldened to act on the other person's behalf and emotionally manipulate others into doing things like y. That doesn't mean your opinion won't change as you learn more about what PTSD is like, but it means that this is a boundary you have set as a promise you will keep to yourself until further notice.

As some beginner advice: PTSD is TERRIBLE. You get shafted with bad days that happen just upon waking up or for some unknown reason 10 after waking up. You don't want to talk to anyone but you are desperate to feel better and for connection with people. Yet you know that because you feel kind of like anywhere from drowning, lost and confused or trapped in brambles that speaking with others about anything other than straight ""I want this/that needs to happen"" is near impossible. So many people with PTSD never get diagnosed because they can manage being functional as long as nobody basically gets in their way when they are triggered, or what has classically been called on a hair trigger -- because they were actually already triggered. My advice, therefore, is to expect him not to act well but not to make excuses for his behavior, especially not towards you; mental health issues are *a reason* for having difficulties but not *an excuse* to be abusive. Fair warning. As he learns more about what's happening for him, it will ironically be more difficult to manage because it means he won't be able to mindlessly use the coping behaviors that used to ""just be his personality."""

In the out loud/vocabulary section, extra points are given for answers that are more of an abstraction than synonym.

On the flip side, those who do have higher mastery may believe that there are others with much more, possibly thinking that if it's so easy for them then they must be missing things others know."

People are not supposed to ""complete"" each other in this way, but your father filled a role of an victim that your mother needed to feel powerful (as did you), and your father needed your mother to please. His relationship with his own mother is probably somewhat similar to your relationship with your mother.

This all might turn your stomach. If you approach him about this, it really can't be too adjust how he sees things but about how you do, like you said. And for you to genuinely move forward you are going to need to address his contribution to your physical and emotional abuse as a child. In the US, your mother would have gone to jail, and your father knows that he protected her while allowing his defenseless child to be beat up. It is *this* that would be said if not that she was, in fact human with real moral failings like the rest of us.

My second piece of advice, unrelated to your question, is that you be extremely careful about the people you date. You have to trust your gut and not make excuses for them as your father did with your mother. Even if they seem to be the complete opposite of your mother: if they ""make a mistake,"" ""got too drunk,"" etc. let them go.

Or you emailed your W2, 1099s and last year's tax return to a professional after speaking with them over the phone (or maybe this is the person who did your taxes two years ago so it was a safe assumption that you meant to go ahead with the work by emailing them even if you didn't sign their contract). 

It's on the business to get the agreement in writing, but this method or mistake is not some genius loophole: there is such a thing as a verbal contract and activities that seem to be done in good faith and acceptance of the terms. There is also such a thing as withholding work until payment is made or undoing work to put old tires back on, eg. The fact that you/someone communicated with other vendors is not ""material"" because you apparently selected a vendor after communicating with all by taking the next step of giving them the work materials that you discussed via phone. It is not unheard of to get a second opinion or have work done twice. It's possible to make a mistake and in this case really it would be between you to work something fair out. 

As the other commenter stated, some states and commonwealths have specific consumer protection laws in place. You might want to consider that both states you mentioned are ""single party consent,"" meaning the phone calls could have been recorded without the hypothetical customer's knowledge, and that would be embarrassing (and expensive) to find out in court. 

In summary, it would be incumbent upon those businesses to follow up to confirm your intent and acceptance of their rates, and to take the next step of getting signature, but their not doing so isn't a guarantee of getting free work."

therapy,foc7wib,t1_fo0u3ib,1587668149.0,"Part II My therapist never told me that I was too angry at my client site or at home. I told her I was with all the stories that I told that I couldn't believe were coming out of my mouth or upon further reflection. I would be like omg yeah that story I told her...I probably shouldn't act like that. And I even said it proudly??? What's wrong with me?! And then I went on this drug Topamax for headaches which happens to be prescribed to people with PTSD for ""anger attacks,"" I had something to compare my behavior to because I had been spending all this time talking about myself in the midst of what can otherwise only be described as ""relationship building"" where honestly, I did not feel as though I was receiving ""therapy."" If anything, I thought I was trying my best to show up on time, filter what I said so I sounded smart, funny and successful, not act weird, look put-together, and avoid the awkward parts (including personal comments that made me even MORE self-conscious, as you are describing but with some mild sexual harassment thrown in there at first). On Topamax, I remember feeling some relative relief from pain that I had previously not bothered to notice, but thanks to so much freaking self-reflection, a HUGE relief from my brain being wrapped all over stuff like an ink-shooting octopus before I had a chance to see the big picture and think whether or not an issue was important and come up with an idea for what to say and how to say it. 

To be quite frank, I described above to you these insights I had in my 'early' therapy but at the time, I felt like all I got were some better social skills as I saw the way that she handled things since I've always worked with men where you can be gruff, inappropriate, etc. and liked some of her sayings, euphemisms, and use of calmer language even if she laughed at my extreme wordings. To be fair, the Topamax was almost a year into therapy and my therapist had only dropped one thing in regard to my anger, but I had to be really listening to notice what she said, which was after I had described a crazy situation my husband ""created"" where I ended up yelling at him. She said ""Next time, try saying to yourself, I'm angry."" That's it. That's all she said. Just like the motivational interviewing where I think she said a total of four things over like 8 months and I ""suddenly"" wasn't drinking at all, she said exactly ONE thing about yelling and acting like a jerk. One. What if she had confronted me? Maybe I would have (realized earlier) called her a jerk. Which I actually did near the end, though I was half-joking. 

So again, same therapist, new therapist, better therapist, cooler therapist. But this is YOUR work to do even if you think your therapist isn't doing any work of their own. As horribly as the first experience turned out because of *her* behavior, I did change many of my habits including some of my above successes and anything else you might read from me plus: not obsessing over saving a few pennies here and there (rewards programs, gas stations, searching for discounts/coupons), not focusing on chores and how clean my car looks and whether my pants and shirts are creased as much as trying to relax when I got home, trying to hold myself back from criticizing others or pointing out a better way just because I knew one (which I always thought was actually a benefit to those around me...I could *finally* see it was stressful and unwarranted). I do believe they can happen with practically any therapist.  But they are going to be mostly your words that matter. So yeah maybe you need a therapist who doesn't talk so much :P"
TalkTherapy,fobl3p6,t3_g68dui,1587660923.0,"The appropriate way to ""confront"" them is through their professional association's ethics comitte vis a vs an ethics complaint. As the other person said, not referring you to another provider (providing a name or three names on paper or email) is not doing the bare minimum so if she didn't do that then you can have your day in a professional setting where her peers can decide whether she handled your care appropriately. 

Please believe me when I say that I am not trying to stir the pot here: you didn't share the story so perhaps your therapist ended because you were threatening suicide and she was not able to handle it properly. The first way I wrote this out was by saying this is a different flavor to experiencing suicidal thoughts and being naturally afraid of them, but while this is true, a good therapist who can handle themselves won't have an issue with someone who is even on the more on the borderline end of actually threatening the way that it sounds vs the way that I meant it. You cannot get closure or a ""final"" session with someone in any capacity when one person is threatening/gesturing towards suicide. But I want to point out that importantly, ending therapy did indeed keep you safe. It is really weird how breaking off a relationship that way can actually be beneficial...hang in there with me. 

In this and the related subs, people talk a lot about their sexual ""transference"" towards their therapists or where they feel like their therapist is the big sister they never had. It is not transference when the person is genuinely hot but yes there is this tendency for people to see and treat others like they expect them to act or be *to them*. That is transference. People in a duo will co-create roles this way. You might have experienced snap relationships where all of a sudden you clicked with someone -- you both fell into roles that fit really well. You may have been in situations where you felt like you and the other person were oil and water but for no ""reason."" It really could be the projections and vibes: this transference stuff. 

If you step back and look at the various relationships in anyone's life, you will see a pattern where each person tends to fall into one of just a few roles *with other people who tend to fall into just a few other roles*. We really do repeat our own histories, even when we think we have chosen to be with people who are ""nothing like"" our family of origin or hometown. 

So transference and counter-transference is actually much more complicated than getting the hots for teacher, and in your case, what genuinely could have been going on - and what has been documented in the literature for people who come from an abandoning, abusive background (which is the type of people who experience suicidal thoughts: hello I'm one, too, nice to meet you) when they go to therapy - is that you and your therapist had recreated an abusive relationship. Yes, I said that. 

It probably wasn't one that was as cut and dry as you acting like a victim and her acting directly abusive and abandoning, but more like you showing her your fears and her putting her guards up (because she felt helpless, even) and this served to hurt you. Where in a healthy relationship (the one she was supposed to be creating to help you heal) she would have been comforting you with psycho education: eg about these thoughts passing and being a remnant of thoughts that make sense as protective thoughts to a child as coping habits (""This wouldn't be so bad if I were dead"") but aren't helpful as an adult, yet our brains still come up with them (I mean, these are the same brains that put on mis-matched socks and say ""You, too"" when other people say ""Goodbye""). So she had fallen into some pattern from her own f'd up life and now if I may blow your mind (or just piss you off with how wrong I am), you guys played this predictable set of three roles along what is called the victim-persecuter-rescuer triangle, where you would feel badly that SHE wasn't comforting you, so maybe you would pull back on sharing your fears of these thoughts, but then as soon as she seemed to be safe enough/acting normal again, you would tell her that you were struggling or thinking about harming yourself and maybe she would try to comfort you but it wouldn't work, and then something would happen so that then she's upset at you again... Instead of her acting like a damn therapist the whole time. 

If this indeed sounds like what was happening, she did the right thing by you not to charge you any more money for that crap because she was actually hurting you, not helping you, and what really took place behind the scenes is probably that she told someone (ie got supervision) who told her she better quit while she's ahead and that no, there's no way to say goodbye. No closure. She done f'd up. But you are fine. And of course you panic when you think about it, you're having flashbacks about her treatment and abusive relationship. You ought to get a psychologist trauma specialist and never mess with a regular therapist again."

I don't want to dissuade you from getting another therapist. I have heard of people bouncing from one therapist to another even for years until they find ""the right one"" (I found the right one on my second try, but I knew I needed a specialist and went and found one). What my utterly unscientific observation has been that there are two types of people *who complain* about long-term therapy whether it is with one or multiple therapists is usually that they are depressed, which I have to say is a given for pretty much everyone in therapy, but some people have depression that is legit ""cured"" with zapping the brain, killing bacteria in their gut, thyroid issues and other things that psychiatry doesn't have the tools to figure out (or figure out quickly), so I can't help but wonder if they are simply barking up the wrong tree. However others are angry/frustrated with therapy and I am bringing this up to educate you as you question this therapist, what therapy can do for you, and your next therapist, if/when you move on to a different one. I want to tell you more about how doing the work and insight works.

I think I addressed misconceptions about therapy here to you above. If I didn't, I know I did in some of my more recent posts because that is an issue I worked through and like to write about. Some people think that seeing a therapist is going to ""change things."" And I get what they mean. Initially, I thought it could make my marriage better and make my anxiety go away. I also did not know that I had a ""traumatic"" childhood and knew nothing about brain stuff. In addition, I was skeptical and skeptical of people who seemed wrought with tears and complaining (who I imagined were ""the type"" to go to therapists). Having simmered on what you wrote here, and the mix of thoughts and feelings I was struggling with as it pertained to therapy early on, I *do* remember feeling that I was wasting my time and money on a person whom I felt I was showing up to entertain and tell things to pointlessly and expensively. It did sometimes feel good, but I had friends I could call for that and an infant at home. So it mostly felt like my one guilt-free ""social hour."" I came to see it basically as that, an excuse to be around someone who apparently thought I was smart and funny. I did not know the therapy was providing me with ""unconditional positive regard."" 

I had an early miscarriage literally the day before I had family coming to visit very early in therapy. I remember thinking ""I can't believe I drove both ways in traffic to tell someone else this for 50 minutes just to hear ""Do the best you can because today is going to suck"" when I could have slept in or cleaned up more."" Total waste of time in my mind. However, that was the session when she asked me, who seemed unperturbed by anything other than the family visit because I knew my mother would be critical of my home, ""How would I have known that you were upset last night?"" I told her that I had gotten drunk and called an ex-boyfriend from 10+ years prior for emotional support (as opposed to my husband). That's *a lot* of information, looking back. So in response to your quip that you don't really want to build a relationship: How else does this stuff come up if we cannot be our total, vulnerable selves because we need to seem ""perfect"" if not through sharing our day-to-day lives with our therapists just ""building a relationship""? Do you think even if I really did know it that I would have been able to say ""I wish I could call my ex boyfriend more because I still feel like I need him -- my husband does not make me feel safe or supported but if I drink I can pretend I am ok or at least go to sleep so I don't have to think about how shitty I feel?"" I do not. I am in a place now where I can say things like this to my current therapist. Honestly just one year ago I could not share personal things like this online. Maybe even six months ago. 

I get not wanting to be seen as anything other than the practiced selves we have been putting on for the world. My therapist once said ""It is scary to be seen."" I have DID and while it used to be called multiple personality disorder, I personally would love to be part of the conversation about how no, it's not multiple personalities *like that*, though I can see how it is a serious active memory and executive functioning problem and how for some people, they embraced the different parts so well that they are self-hypnotized. It's more like how you described it when as you say that you ""uncontrollably"" act certain ways around certain people, except with the added problem of being in fight/flight/freeze/fawn and flashbacks making functioning more difficult. What you described is a real thing and it relates to neural networks that get laid down: if you've ever heard of ""neurons that fire together wire together"" with reference to learning, it explains why when I say ""dog"" you will think of ""fire hydrant"" before you will think of ""whale"" (conscious/explicit, declarative memory) but also why when you are around certain high school friends you might suddenly become shy (unconscious/implicit, procedural memory) -- two different *types* of memory but both trained and difficult to change (even more difficult when you are like me and in a flashback/dissociated while acting certain ways; it's basically hopeless). It would be ridiculous for me to ask you to stop thinking of ""fire hydrant,"" but there are ways to replace it with a whole lot of practice. Same goes for other thoughts, and concomitant behavioral changes. So if I may rephrase what you are saying you want from a therapist and hope that I'm getting it about right, where you say that you would like to just be confronted by someone (eg a different therapist) about certain thoughts, beliefs and behaviors that are holding you back, I'm here to tell you that *the brain* just doesn't work like that. Again I'm not saying a different therapist or different type of therapist isn't the best decision for you.

So what works in therapy? It's what works in the rest of life: trial and error, learning from mistakes and continuing to try through failure. It's going to come from talking about yourself, what you want, what is actually happening, noticing the difference between the two, trying something new, and talking about that. The therapist does have tools and techniques to support you so you don't get stuck in places where you won't be able to help it, or get hung up on things you can't change -- and work with you on the things you get stuck and hung up on. Look, it took you however many years to develop the personality(ies) that got you through school teachers, school friends, and college, church, work, what have you -- all the arenas in life, until you could recognize that actually, your ways of being and coping mechanisms within each personality you bring to the table in each of your roles *is actually not working out for you as a whole*. Most people don't really have that insight or willingness to explore the possibility of it being true. This isn't really about you at the core but about what you are doing and yes, what leads you to what you are doing in your mind as you react rather than respond to things. That second part is what you are saying you want from your therapist but frankly, *only you know this and only you can figure this out, or with the help of someone who has been listening to you talk about your life, paying close attention to the way you talk about your life, yourself, other people, events and ideas*.

You would have to share it from your ongoing experiences; there is not going to be any one centerpiece exemplar of your personal problems that can be unraveled. It's going to be stuff like ""I was given an opportunity that I went for but now I'm not doing anything about it"" (self-sabotage). A therapist you've been talking to for hours and hours might have some insight: do you tend to have certain critical thoughts? Are you afraid of the exact thing that happens to be an outcome of doing this thing successfully like giving an acceptance speech? Are you personally against something related to the greater organization like the art contest is sponsored in part by PETA and you would love to win but PETA is craycray? You know what I mean. The therapist can connect *those kinds of dots* from hearing you talk, and talk to you about it in a therapeutic way whereas a friend might say ""Screw PETA, give a shitty speech and take their money*.""* That might not help you do the art *and feel good about it.* Also, a therapist can help ask you, when you describe a situation you're confused about, more questions about what you were thinking, and do the same thing. If they think you would react well to it -- once they know that therapeutic alliance is there. Based on what you're saying, it may just be that your therapist knows the alliance isn't built yet."

In my personal experience, people who are like that are always like that and are equal-opportunity jerks. 

The alpha way to handle this is an email to him saying how much you appreciated the time working there, how much you learned, and list your overall stats in a formal way: ""... without your support, I could never have achieved top sales three quarters running two of three years and set the record for blah."" Whatever it is, thank him for YOUR work. He will reply saying he appreciates it, thinks you were great, is sorry to see you go, and wishes you well. Then immediately ask him for a LinkedIn recommendation through the site, along with your favorite coworkers and any other account manager/senior person. If it's a senior person, send them your stats so they know what to write if they choose to do so. Don't take it personally if people don't recommend you. Some people are weird. And maybe you/they don't use LinkedIn much, but now is the time to do this. 

Whether he writes you a referral or not, you can very honestly use what you wrote that he acknowledged/endorsed as a quote *from* him and put it at the top of your resume or your LinkedIn profile (once you've collected the recommendations so you don't tip him off or repeat what others say). So be mindful of how anything you write to him will sound turned around  as a manager quote/resume bullet point highlight, ""Rosy was the top sales generator for six out of eight quarters and grew the F1 sales more than any other employee, setting new dealership records and I was sorry to see them leave..."" 

Let him tell you that you can't say that :) he will be too shy to if he even thinks it, but you have proof in the email and honestly as an employer, (yes I know it can be faked), I would be more interested in the validated stats of a salesperson than what their hyped up boss really thought of them...not that I'm into sales like that. But in any job, it's really what you can do other than the connections that counts on getting in. 

By the way, he can't (in the US) give a negative recommendation so not only do you not have to worry about what he would say as a reference, but you don't need to list him personally even if you use his name and title in this quote you carry around while you need it on the job market. Employers are more interested that your job experience is real and that you are going to get there on time and don't need babysitting. So you're fine, no need to confront or fear him."

ptsd,fo71sa4,t3_g5wlvl,1587570730.0,"Hi, that's normal for what you have been through, and everyone with PTSD. It makes me wonder what is going on to have redundant diagnoses -- panic, anxiety, depression and sleep disturbances are all symptoms of PTSD and how PTSD is diagnosed. It's not wrong, it just makes me wonder enough to ask if you are seeing a trauma specialist as compared to someone with trauma training. If your trauma was recent, you have a very real chance of ridding yourself of PTSD for good and not having it become a lifelong thing to manage so I want to suggest that you immediately switch to a psychologist trauma specialist (that is the recommendation regardless, but especially for someone who ""only"" has recent PTSD Type I). 

Since I'm throwing out unsolicited, uncontextualized information, you may/likely have already had traumatizing experiences so my advice may be moot -- only you know if anxiety and depression are new in your life. If they are, then as someone who is stuck with this crap I do strongly urge you to seek the most specialized care that you can as quickly as possible. 

As far as the insomnia goes, a feature of PTSD is the disruption of REM sleep. You've probably heard of this part of the cycle (we ""need"" 2-3/night, each cycle might take around an hour and a half to two hours, which is where the eight hours total recommendation kind of comes from). REM is where your brain takes the different sensory memories and packages them together to create complete memories for long term storage. In PTSD, this process gets messed up and the images (even from our imagination), sounds, physical sensations, smells -- everything, are not connected and therefore can continue to be ""reexperienced"" as if they are happening *right now.* When we think of traumatic events - or the events intrude on our daily living without actually calling up the memory on purpose - we can be right back there. For some of us, all we know is that we think we see something, hear something, and feel really unsafe, like something bad is about to happen/has happened/is happening. Or just get a mental image and feel that way. Or get nothing and feel that way. 

When this happens during waking hours, it's really upsetting and we can think we're going crazy, think we are ""anxious,"" have difficulty concentrating, panic, etc. Get really depressed because we can't function and the world feels unsafe. Then things slide and continue not to function and can't even explain why. We are irritable and again, can't explain it but as humans, rationalize the anger, trending to blame things that from the outside get labeled (accurately) as ""control"" issues: we feel so helpless about how we feel that we do try to control what we can in an effort to keep things from being the cause of setting off these otherwise inexplicable symptoms... 

The flashbacks that make no sense. It's not like we can say ""I was just trying to get my work done and suddenly it's like I was a little kid freaking out while I watched xyz go down and I couldn't do anything about it for 3 hours."" No, it's more like ""I was getting work done and this lady said X and I couldn't believe it so I said Y and I shouldn't have then found out Z so the rest of my day was ruined and I went home and it's such a mess where I live because blah blah and then I ended up eating like crap/drinking/gambling /shopping...but still...do you see what I deal with!"" Our lives are straight out of control and any one thing points that out ,but to us all those"" one things"" point out is the difficulty in life that we happen to have a lot of and don't realize that other people manage to live with a lot less stress and burden *because they are able to make different choices because they aren't dealing with chronic stress and flashbacks where things are much more difficult than they should be.

Here's what happens whether it's day or night, and why you panic, and why you wake up: your nervous system goes into ""fight or flight."" Whether you are the type to go into the last of the four (it's actually fight, flight, fawn or freeze -- freeze being where you don't move or scream), or the first one where you can fly off the handle, when your brain thinks you are in danger whether it's from a real threat or a memory of a threat (to you or someone else if it caused PTSD), your entire body switches over into its sympathetic nervous system state, giving you a rush of adrenaline and lowering your heart rate (in freeze). As soon as you can escape (in some flashbacks, you go into freeze, but once that is over, you go into flight or higher up into fight), your heart rate speeds up, pumping that adrenaline to your muscles (and away from your brain and other organs) along with extra oxygen so you can GTFO. But again, if you're just sitting there at work with nothing going on, or maybe just some lady saying something to you, you feel absolutely nuts. You panic! You think about what your body feels like and you can't do anything about it and you literally make it worse by thinking about it instead of calming yourself down.

OK what about nighttime? You wake up. You can be dreaming and a theme from your trauma pops up, be it helpless in the face of nature, an assailant, being lost, trapped, whatever, your body wakes you the mf up because you are being pumped full of stuff to help you actively run. How fast and far? This is the level of natural drugs that people get in war. The type of thing that people pull heroics with during fires, car crashes, etc. And it's happening while you sleep. So you wake up. Even if you took sleeping pills, got drunk, etc. You wake right up ready to start your day at 4am.

It's important to work hard in therapy to learn how to calm down, to train your body how to calm down, how to recognize when different types of scenarios are occurring so that you can master them. And for you in particular, if all this is brand new, you are going to want to do this asap before brain changes set in and your PTSD Type I doesn't become lifelong PTSD Type II. Because there is ""healing and recovery"" but not ""reversal"" and ""remission."""
helpmecope,fo4ee0f,t1_fo4ccch,1587502915.0,"It is great that you already have a therapist. It's good to talk that stuff out as it gives your therapist an idea of what to refer you back to when you describe symptoms and responses in your current life. I described some in my own in one of the last couple of longer comments... I really needed my therapist to put things together for me to see that wow, OK that really is what is going on for me. A complicated childhood can lead to a complicated adulthood. But knowing more about your triggers means having control once you are triggered. 

On Sunday I took a walk with my son. Everything was fine and suddenly I started feeling really tired and woozy. It's an experience I'm used to and which has made life really difficult: I've played contact sports through it, attended meetings, gotten work done, gone to parties (and left suddenly), I drive... I have fallen and hurt myself like this. But I was able to talk myself through it even though all I wanted was really to grab him, get home, lie down in bed and go to sleep. It wasn't great but it wasn't horrible and didn't ruin the walk, much less the rest of my day. You might not have symptoms at that end of the spectrum, or maybe you do but are so used to it/don't know how to describe it or where to put it that you don't pay it much attention and move on as quickly as possible as I always did. 

Your therapist is probably offering video sessions if you do want to reach out. You should check with your insurance company if those will be covered; mine requires me to have seen the provider in person first, I don't know what your state allows/restricts. But most states do not require coverage for phone sessions unless you are in a remote location."
