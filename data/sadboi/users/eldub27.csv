I was pretty miserable. Then after I graduated highschool I moved out and partied a lot, ended up not being able to pay rent due to being irresponsible with my money, using it for drugs, alcohol, etc. I ended up having to stay in a shelter. I also slept around a lot and got abused. During all of this rebelliousness (I grew up in a strict Christian home) there were definitely some ‚Äúfun‚Äù, free moments but there was also a lot of pain.    
Edit: included my high-school experience bc it was the beginning of my bad phase, and explained that part of my drug and alcohol phase also felt freeing.."

AskReddit,fn0g2js,t1_fn034lj,1586541284.0,"There have been stories of people forgiving their sons murderer and loving them, knowing that they came to a point in their life that was that dark for a reason, and the individuals life being changed with that second chance. That to me is the true reflection of Gods love and forgiveness. I have prayed for the people who have hurt me, and though it is hard to imagine them in heaven, as I am on earth and have finite understandings, I trust and find comfort in this verse: He [God] will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, -for the former things have passed away-.‚Äù (revelation 21:4) There is also the belief that in heaven, when God comes back to save us, (and by us I mean everyone- that is Gods will- for example, in 1st Timothy 2:3-4 it states that ‚Äú...God our saviour, who wants -all people- to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth‚Äù and in 2nd Peter 3: 
The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. He is -patient- with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but -everyone- to come to repentance) and that we will receive ‚Äúnew‚Äù bodies- ‚ÄúFor our citizenship is in heaven, from which also we eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ; who will transform the body of our humble state into conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the power that He has even to subject all things to Himself‚Äù Philippians 3:20-21. To me, these verses represent the new life we are given, in which our old life is dead, and with that old life, the sins and pain that came with it. I would be able to accept the presence of those who hurt me, in heaven, if they were to come to God. Now, it is not necessarily right for me to be in contact with these individuals, so unless I feel God speaking to me, I won‚Äôt be the ones that will tell them about Jesus, but I can pray for them. Furthermore, abusers often have been abused themselves, and have not had the chance to heal/ and they chose to give evil for evil. I have learned in my program, through reading a book called ‚ÄúThe Boy Who Was Raised As a Dog‚Äù (which includes multiple stories) by Bruce Perry, a well regarded psychiatrist), that psychopaths often have traumatic/neglectful/loveless upbringings. For some, there is hope, I believe, as well as there are some who may be beyond that if they resist changing/seeking rectitude. 
as for the LGBTQ community, I believe that God loves them the same as everyone else, and that these people should not be forced to change who they are... that said, as someone who is bicurious, and is in a committed relationship with a man, I would never cheat on him with a woman, and I believe that it is Gods will that I am with him, and not a woman. I still struggle with many doubts/fears but I am happy to say that I am a believer, and it is much much better than the life I lived before coming back to my faith."
