teenrelationships,fp1q848,t3_gapuqy,1588244346.0,"1. Its not weird, try it.
2. Sure. If you want to.
3. I would recommend maybe texting in the morning saying good morning,imo thats a great start tho.
4. Well it really depends if she is interested in talking to you. But what you can do is finding topics to talk about tho. Whats her hobby? (Im pretty sure you would know)
5. Well as a teen maybe a ice cream date? It sounds cute tho. Just like question 4 it depends what she likes, if she okay to talk to you maybe asking her would be better!

Lastly, good luck!"

AskReddit,fo9amwh,t3_g69kfu,1587614496.0,"So basically there is this thing school last year a senior couple fucked and for whatever reasons the boy bragged at school. In a Asian country and a Chinese school that's totally not acceptable. So they were sent to the discipline department after someone reported or something, after tons of talks and shit the school decided one of them needs to get the punishment which is getting expelled. The girl just went up and said for the boys future im leaving instead. After that I heard in a anonymous thread in my school claiming its the girls friend, she was getting kicked out from her house and she stayed in this anonymous girl house. Well that's pretty fucked up in my opinion."
