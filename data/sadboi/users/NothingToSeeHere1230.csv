When he hatched, everybody hated him. His parents threw him out and eventually Wasp did too. But since this little guy was an optimist, he took the name Freak from everybody and called it his own name. 


He was hatched during the Tree Wars, so he had run off to hide in a cave until a certain Silkwing found him. That Silkwing was Buggy (coming soon). Buggy and him were both outcasts and bonded well. 

Might be important somewhere later on, probably in Unknown Tales or something."
