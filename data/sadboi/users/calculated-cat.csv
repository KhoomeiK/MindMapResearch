AskReddit,fpjm3ly,t1_fpiiykt,1588673628.0,I think this is why I hate my body so much. My mum constantly talks about how much she hates her body and how ugly and fat she is and constantly pointing out how other people have lovely bodies. I had restrictive eating problems growing up but managed to hide it - which then led to binge eating when I was 17. So I went from deadly skinny to bigger and it‚Äôs just been this constant battle between losing lots of weight to gaining in short amounts of time most of my adult life. I just wish she‚Äôd see herself as more than her weight but it‚Äôs projected into my life now too.

vegan,fiwbk4f,t1_fiwala0,1582780358.0,"Vegan cooking is amazing if you enjoy cooking. It helps you be a lot more creative and passionate about it, can be super fun. I found that I discovered what qualities of food I enjoy most without ever even being aware before I was vegan (gooey-ness of cheese, not the actual taste - is a huge craving of mine, so is something with a meaty, filling texture but again, not necessarily the taste!) Of course, most people eat meat because it does taste good and don‚Äôt want to let go of it (hence being anti-vegan) perhaps having a stronger moral baseline would help. 

I think that it‚Äôs actually quite easy to swap the meat for substitutes or to even make your own vegan version for yourself, and let someone else add meat/dairy/eggs if they so desperately want it (that‚Äôs what I tell my friends if we are cooking as I won‚Äôt touch it now). It‚Äôs also good to look at plant based diets for health reasons, something you could bring up to your family. 

At some point after going vegan, you‚Äôll crave meat/dairy and so on for a bit, but you sort of just forget what it even tastes like and start to view them as disgusting products (as well as finding substitutes that make you happy). If the best version of yourself doesn‚Äôt eat meat then you could try to see how it makes you feel over a few weeks. Get watching some docs, too, the stronger the moral the more inclined you are to stick to it."
