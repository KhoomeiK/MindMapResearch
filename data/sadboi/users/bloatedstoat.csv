BipolarReddit,fmw18ol,t3_fxkdaw,1586437110.0,"Bi-Polar type I here. I have been diagnosed for 12 years. After being hospitalized due to mania and trying more medications than I can remember, I gave up on psychiatry and dropped out of college due to depression. When mania kicked in again I decided to move to L.A. on a whim and ended up homeless and addicted to drugs as I didn't have a realistic plan or any way to support myself. After sucking up my pride and admitting to myself that I'd be dead in under a year if I continued that path, I moved back in with my parents and sought psychiatric help once again. The doctors put me on 900 mg of Lithium extended release per night and it flipped a switch in my life. I was finally able to hold down a job. I decided to get fully clean (weed and alcohol included) and completed treatment for Hep. C. I moved into an apartment; the first place of my own in my life. I started taking classes at a community college and did well enough to transfer to a reputable architecture program. And, my proudest accomplishment to date, I held down a relationship with an amazing woman for five years and we got married this past fall. These things may seem like routine accomplishments for most people, but with my ups and downs before med. compliance with Lithium I never thought they would be possible for me. Everyone's path to stability is different and I really hope you find yours."

AskReddit,fmb68bk,t3_fu5ac0,1585919414.0,"I was homeless in L.A. in my early 20's due to untreated mental health issues, chasing drugs and a series of burnt bridges. I was staying in a car park at an abandoned apartment complex a block North of Hollywood Blvd. It had turned into a spot for a few of my street friends and I to shoot up, bucket bathe and crash when we needed. One night I was trying to sleep off some cotton fever (when you shoot up a bit of the cotton you use to filter heroin) and a friend who was staying there asked if I could watch a backpack for him. I agreed, since I definitely wasn't trying to go anywhere. I fell asleep and the next thing I know I'm woken up to someone right above me screaming at me. This random dude I'd never seen before had a knife next to my face and was screaming at me so loud that he was going to stab me in my eye that he was spitting all over my face. I was fucking terrified on top of being sick. This went on for at least five minutes and I've never been more scared for my life. Apparently he was mad that I didn't open the fire-door to let him in and he thought I was trying to steal his stuff. I managed to talk him down, but that was one of the moments that pushed me toward getting my life together. Lots of bullshit happened to me when I lived on the streets and every day I'm thankful to be in a better place; both physically and mentally."
