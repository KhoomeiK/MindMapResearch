AskReddit,fomotx8,t3_g88ccd,1587898324.0,"There were two such scary situations when I was about 8-9 years old. We lived in a block of flats, my mother was at work. There was a fire at the neighbors above us. The whole apartment stank of burning and fire brigade came. I didn't know what to do so I sat in the window crying and one fireman saw me and they came for me. They led me to the neighbors one floor below and I waited for my mother there. The second situation was when I slammed in the bathroom, the lock was broken and I just forgot about it. I couldn't open the door, I didn't have a phone with me, the front door were also locked and my mother didn't have keys with her so I started to panic. Fortunately, after a long time I managed to get out."

Next morning I was all nervous because of that situation and thought we will act weird. Now I think it was just love at first sight."

gerbil,fidgn0l,t3_f7qpjj,1582366770.0,"So, Arrow's sister died suddenly about 3 weeks ago. First, we gave her time to be alone and see how she behave. Well, it was worse and worse every day. She slept almost all days. She seemed sad and lonely and we knew we couldn't wait longer. We ordered gerbil in pet shop, wait one week and then it turned out we have to wait another week, cause they didn't get any gerbils. We didn't want to wait, especially when the opportunity to get young gerbil from someone appeared. So I made a call and in hour we had our little girl. 
Then the time to meet them came. The beginning wasn't the best, Arrow chase Cheetos and Cheetos were later afraid of Arrow. But after that no fighting or chasing happened and they went through tolerance to taking care of each other. Arrow is bigger and she helps Cheetos in some things, they sleep together, drink together, and they're so so sweet that I can't, my heart totally melts. 
We are so happy that they managed to get on well. And that it happened so quickly. Arrow needed another gerbil, and now she's more active and has somebody to cuddle with."
