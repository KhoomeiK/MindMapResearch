AskWomen,fl3xy9y,t3_fm4xtj,1584801262.0,"My (28F) partner (29F) let me know that I was mentally overwhelming to her. It was a tough conversation, but ultimately made our relationship so much better.

While I can‚Äôt remember exactly what she said, I am able to tell you what I heard. My intentions here are to translate...kind of. 

So we‚Äôve been together for 6 years. We each ultimately raised ourselves and then continued to raise each other when we met. We both have PTSD and GAD (‚ÄúAnxiety‚Äù). I remember hearing that I was very controlling and that my PTSD responses are no longer necessary. And that I was hurting her. That was the biggest thing. She‚Äôs the bomb.com and I really do only want to make her feel good. We set boundaries that led to a stronger relationship because now we understand where each other stands and we get to spend more time showing love to each other than pushing each other away.

I wish you and your SO the best and feel free to ask me anything. Best of luck."

In addition to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to remap how your mind processes your anxieties, breathing exercises really do work to relax during anxious times. 

What helps me is breathing opposite my anxiety, which is done by making your exhales longer than your inhales. I do: 5 counts in through nose, 6 counts hold, 7 counts out through mouth). I also play rain sounds (or some other comforting sound) loudly to drain the chatter. If you are still thinking, turn it up. 

Hope this helps, darlin‚Äô."
