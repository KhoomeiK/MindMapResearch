psychology,fq9hj1u,t1_fq8fcy0,1589198422.0,"Okay...so to put this into action,

Say I go to the grocery store and run into someone I don't like. They treated me poorly in the past so I'm triggered, but they don't say anything to me.

Positive reappraisal - this is an opportunity for me to use coping techniques I've learned. Practice is part of therapy. I'm happy they didn't say anything to me, that means this is easier to deal with.

Detached reappraisal - they were wearing a blue shirt. They had 3 oranges in their basket. They will go home after this and probably have a meal just like I will. Etc.

Does this sound right?"
BipolarReddit,fq9gkap,t3_ghcqre,1589197575.0,"Yes. When we are PMSing or menstruating, our estrogen tanks. Estrogen protects the body from pain. When we don't have that, it can effect our moods in huge ways. Our metabolism and the way we digest our meds can also change while on our periods. I also have PCOS and possible PMDD. I track my mood, my period, and the moon cycles religiously. Do it. It will help you. Tons of research in barometric pressure from the moon effecting bipolar AND our periods. Sometimes shit gets really bad for me, and obviously it's uncontrollable. But at least I'm able to think ahead and prepare. Things rarely sneak up on me now.

Also, just an extra bit of info. Women with PCOS are 8x more likely to develop bipolar."

My most embarrassing...I'm sure I have quite a few memories that I've blocked out. But the one I remember the most is probably a couple weeks before I was diagnosed in 2015. I got obliterated drunk. Drank a whole case of twisted teas, chugged them all. Drank a Mickey of vodka. Stole booze from friends. Drove everyone to the bar. Lost my car throughout the night. Took a cab to a friend's place when the bars closed. I had no money so I made out with the cab driver and gave him my number. Got into my friend's place. Cuddled with an African American guy on the couch whom I had never met before (where I'm from there is a very low black population and many people are pretty racist, so to see your friend doing that can be shocking, even though he was nice). We made out hard core infront of everyone. I saw a bouncy ball on the table at one point so I stole it. Ended up being a fuck ton of THC butter inside of it that was my friend's (I don't smoke weed so I gave it back a week later.) Did a fuck ton of cocaine, blacked out, ended up at some weird party in a basement across the city where I knew no one so I did mystery drugs alone in the living room. Woke up at a totally different side of the city in the black guy's apartment, in his king size bed alone, fully clothed, with 5 other tall black dudes in the livingroom. When I woke up they were like ""Good morning sweet heart did you have a good sleep, we gotta go to work so you gotta leave."" My phone was at 4% I had no fucking idea where I was lol. Friend picked me up eventually. Keep in mind this whole time I have a delusion of grandeur that I'm a celestial alien princess trapped in a human body and I can't tell anyone or I'll get caught or they will kill me or something.

But it's made me lose everything at the same time. If I was committed to my book I could have promoted it a lot more and gone far.

I've seen doctors more than every month since I was fucking 12 years old?! What do you mean I need to ""try to treat my bipolar""?! THAT'S LITERALLY ALL I DO. I WANT TO GET BETTER. I recommend different things to my doctors and psychiatrist everytime I see them. I have reached out to universities for ketamine treatments and FECAL TRANSPLANTS and other new treatments. I can't get ANY help.

You've never had gastritis. You have no idea how much pain it is. It's the worst pain of my life. I can't breathe. It makes me feel like my ribs are breaking. I have gone to the ER a million times. Even taken ambulance rides. I puke, violently, I shake and get chills. I have to stick my fingers down my throat to get the bile out. I dry heave. And those are just the attacks. I'm constantly in pain. I have this gnawing hunger all the time as if my stomach is eating itself. The burning. Everytime I eat something I almost shit myself. I have shit myself in public before because of my issues.

So no. I'd rather not be in worse physical pain than I already am so I can take a pill feel worse, and still have bipolar symptoms except I can't cum and I can't cry. Plus it makes my PCOS worse and my period is a fucking nightmare.

Onision,fffa01m,t3_et99st,1579879343.0,"If Greg doesn't show up, the case will be dismissed. If he does show up, the judge will see video proof of Hansen not yelling, and will dismiss the case against Hansen. Not sure what they'll do about Repzion but probably similar because Daniel never went to Greg's house and since he's a celebrity it's legal to criticize him publicly. And after today he will probably wallow and try to make everyone feel sorry for him because he's soooo depressed and suchhhh a victim."
BipolarReddit,fff8hkg,t1_fff8d3x,1579878342.0,I only took it for like a week and then stopped because it induced psychosis for me.
BipolarReddit,fff7ylb,t1_fff7veu,1579877976.0,Sorry. I wasn't trying to give you advice. I thought you were replying to my comment thread about cystic acne and PCOS. My mistake. I never recommended anything. Just asked a question. Sorry.
BipolarReddit,ffe5xzc,t1_ffe5qmb,1579837566.0,"Yeah I know, you may not have PCOS, but most hormones work the same, and acne like that usually has the same root problem. I realize acne is normal with a period but cystic acne all the time is not. Also, how is Yasmin dangerous? It's a pretty standard treatment for PCOS. I personally hated it because it induced psychosis for me."
PlusSize,ffe46mw,t1_ffco0ad,1579836242.0,"Yes, I figured that's what it meant especially because our winters are so cold here. But at face value it is really cute lol."
BipolarReddit,ffe41dz,t1_ffc1lf9,1579836133.0,What pill were you on? Certain birth control like Yasmin can give more control to hormones for PCOS and help a lot with symptoms. But only for certain people.
BipolarReddit,ffe3ukj,t1_ffcjct7,1579835994.0,"The three diagnostic criteria for PCOS are: ovarian cysts, insulin resistance, and high testosterone/androgens. You need two out of three of these things to be diagnosed with PCOS. Some people can have zero symptoms or all symptoms from this. PCOS is also similar to bipolar where it isn't the syndrome itself that develops, because it was always there, it's the symptoms that develop."
BipolarReddit,ffbqyfs,t3_espgzv,1579779213.0,"Are you male or female? Lithium and depakote (and lamotrigine...and etc etc) can cause female reproductive health to worsen, causing androgens to rise, which in turn causes bad acne. I have PCOS so I get horrible cystic acne everywhere. I haven't noticed much of a change since I quit lithium in December. I'll keep looking out for changes"
PlusSize,ffbcccq,t3_esjvhd,1579759446.0,Hahahaha my psych always puts that I'm dressed appropriately for the weather. That's always nice to see!
Onision,ff8l7jc,t1_ff8kqfl,1579683901.0,YES.
Onision,ff8guv8,t1_ff7tcgj,1579677897.0,FUCK. I WANNA SCREAM.
BipolarReddit,ff8dneu,t1_ff8dcai,1579674130.0,"Yeah, I'm sober now, but I actually used to abuse it myself (snorting, I don't recommend it, nose bleed city). But injecting has become increasingly more popular the last few years."
BipolarReddit,ff8asf1,t1_ff86jx6,1579671193.0,Totally understandable. Yes I used to be on Wellbutrin and it definitely is a stimulant. It's actually the most abused drug in jails where I am from. But I know it can also help many people because it is a very unique drug.
BipolarReddit,ff85x14,t1_ff7zlgf,1579666885.0,"Hmm, you're on Wellbutrin and Zoloft? Are you not on any mood stabilizers or antipsychotics? Being on just antidepressants with bipolar is quite dangerous, because it can worsen symptoms. And not just induce mania/hypomanic, it can worsen depression as well. But you've found to be fine with it?"
BipolarReddit,ff7xl4q,t3_es4kek,1579660755.0,"I have PCOS. When my dad passed away, I had a period that was super heavy and lasted around 6 whole months. Everyday. I was off meds and manic for sure. Had to get an IUD to stop the bleeding because I could have lost too much blood."
PCOS,ff7wkya,t3_erw4lv,1579660075.0,She's giving really good advice. Keto is a shit diet and is terrible for us and our hearts. In 5 years people will forget about it.
