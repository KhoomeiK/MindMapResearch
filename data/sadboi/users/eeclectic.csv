zerocarb,fgwkkry,t3_f0jj87,1581162223.0,"I like rosemary personally, especially with lamb.

Otherwise, salt, pepper, chilli, I do a bit of garlic every so often. Butter is great.

I think most spices that you prefer, just in small enough quantity, should be fine! Just try replicate flavours you enjoyed before. Maybe look up chimichurri and mess with which flavour combos you'd like. Good luck!"
BingeEatingDisorder,exbc05q,t3_crvzcv,1566127827.0,"Not beat, but managed/reduced frequency.

I found that IF/OMAD has helped. So I can still enjoy a big meal, while getting enough nutrition wise. Though also meant if I ate more then I planned at one meal, I could just skip the next 'meal' and thus did get into the whole F\* it mentality that used to send me into a continuous eating cycle. Just my experience! Not a solution, but it has helped reduce frequency for me. Definitely steer clear of snacking, grazing, or mindless chewing!

Also found that IF helped stabilise my insulin levels enough that I wasn't continuous feeling like eating/snacking."

bulimia,etwirvm,t3_cdoctv,1563272562.0,"Haha not a rotisserie chicken, but ordered a whole cooked chook from nandos and ate it all by myself, sitting in my chilling by a river. It was actually awesome, 10/10 would recommend"
BingeEatingDisorder,etwi8fa,t3_cdov0s,1563271802.0,"Oh wow! I never really even thought about it. The food guilt is real. 

Same on the 8-9 front. My mum used to say she would enrol me in fat camp and tell all my friends that I couldn't go to their houses because I was at fat camp."
depression,etqy9s2,t3_cd0hjp,1563106836.0,"Wow yep. Youâ€™re certainly not alone. 

Sometimes I wish I could fall apart visibly so then maybe people would take the kind of invisible suffering of depression seriously. 

But simultaneously, I just canâ€™t seem to stand the idea of burdening anyone else with things I deal with in my own mind. Itâ€™s just too silly and sad to explain maybe. Ha. Also sometimes going through the motions of work or cleaning helps in a distraction kind of way."

Though, I'd probably sign up and then after making the profile, get too anxious then delete the app.

So down to nap anytime though"
raisedbynarcissists,erafdi4,t3_c0vnnj,1560642403.0,"You're not being unreasonable at all. Sending a big hug, it's such an awful feeling. 

It's incredibly hard to deal with a whole family who actively exclude you. And I am so so so sorry you've had to go through this.

Something that always helped me through was the saying ""friends are the family you choose for yourself."" Just try and remember your value as a person is based on yourself, not others (AKA family members who don't give you basic decency or respect), and try surround yourself with friend-family (or extended family even) and those who support you and genuinely want the best for you!

Also congrats on finishing your exams, and well done for al the hours and hours of hard work and diligence! Wishing big and exciting things for your future uni career. <3"
Celiac,eprwgvp,t1_eprpd41,1559432047.0,"Ah man! What a tough situation. It's hard to help people when they don't listen. And gluten can be snuck in so many ways!

[https://www.coeliac.org.au/associated-conditions/](https://www.coeliac.org.au/associated-conditions/)

This has a list of conditions that are associated with Coeliac and long term cheating if thats of any help!

Best of luck"
Celiac,eprvpwu,t3_bvoe8c,1559431717.0,"Ah man, its people like this make me really sad. They really push back the whole GF seriousness for coeliacs. You really can't just 'cheat' with gluten when its AUTOIMMUNE.  Theres a lot more damage going on. And the more people who do the whole ""its worth xyz"" mean that emphasising the importance of CC gets seriously down played. 

Also, oh man, when people who are self-diagnosed coeliac (which is fine!) start going ""oh its fine if I only cheat every once and a while"" do the same thing. :-("
