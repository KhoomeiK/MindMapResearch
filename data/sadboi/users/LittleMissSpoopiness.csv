 If you are in the U.S.A, depending on which state, government assistance sets you up for failure . If you make a little over the requirement they start to reduce/cut off what you receive ie; childcare, health-care, or Food stamps, etc. Don't get me started on how many hours you are allowed to work to keep your eligibility. 

Just because parents seem to get a ""pass"" on certain things, at the end of the day they still have to tend to that child day in and day out. I don't think it would be a good idea to create a life simply to get the same ""privileges"" a parent.


 If you are tired: you have every right to be tired
