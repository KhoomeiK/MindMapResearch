""drums"" are samples but a lot of the ambience is just messing around with synthesizers and doing a lot of audio processing. A lot of distortion, parallel processing the different parts. The base idea is that I take a sound, separate it into 2 different audio tracks, add a distortion or some other effect (phasing in a lot of this) and then compress the hell out of the phaser and turn down the gain until it fits smoothly in the sound. That sort of deal. Obviously there was tons of that, but I did rerecording of some audio coming out my speaker and added reverb and only used the high ends, fun stuff. Broke a lot of my previous processes to try to get a new sound, used lots of chains which is what Mick Gordon was talking about. Pretty fun stuff."

edmproduction,fjibe9s,t1_fjhgvd7,1583364046.0,"Musically its solid dude, really cool tune

Drop that comes in at 0:37, your lead synths sound like they are clipping pretty hard. I would fix first and foremost for sure. This might also be due to something on your master track, if you have a limiter brickwalling your track this could also cause clipping due to level imbalances.

Kicks in your drop get drowned hard by the intense bass (I like it, dont take that the wrong way). Try sidechaining your lead synths/bass to your kick so you can hear those babies fuckin pump dude. It might do well to layer the kick with something with some hi tones (doesnt have to layer the whole kick, just a small section on it to give it a ""click"") to have your kicks punch harder. Maybe compress them so they really punch hard too. Might wanna try EQing your bass a bit to to ""carve"" a little section for your kicks. Find the main frequency where the note of the kick lays, and then EQ that part out slightly from the bass so the two of them play nice.

Try Eqing the bass out of your chords in the intro, duplicate the track, and pan them left and right to give the intro less volume and more of an airy feel. Also might be worth all together to drop the intro by a few DB to increase the punch on the drop. 

It's cool though man, different than a lot of what I've heard previously.

And also don't worry about if the track sounds melancholy at all, just make what comes to you dude."
edmproduction,fji9m5d,t1_fjhhtt8,1583362995.0,"Yeah dude I like it, musically its pretty solid, cant give you much advice there because the track flows pretty nicely.

Only things I pretty much have to say is this, hand it to a mix and master engineer. They could do a lot of things to make this track pop a lot harder than it does.

during the drops the hats fall out a bit

The snare riser that starts around 0:57 could use a bit of volume to give it that really intense oh my god next part is happening feel. 

At 1:11 you have a horn sound come in with some nice reverb on it, might be worth trying to cut that reverb (via gate or sampling the noise and reducing the duration by a tad) a little short to keep it cleaner and choppier and give the next part of the track a bit of room to pop.
When the next part comes in at 1:33ish, maybe try cutting some of the sub away from the kick to make it less intense, and that way when you bring it back in for the whole next drop, suddenly the track has bass and everyone goes nuts because of finally the listeners get what they want. (just a small mind trick) Maybe even try reducing the gain of this part in general by 1 or 2 db just to give that extra pop to the next drop, thats just a matter of taste though. 

You might also want to EQ your supersaws during the drop a bit so it helps the bass part come in a bit better.

Take this next part with a grain of salt

The synth starting at 1:07 (the high string one, that you start off with 3 single notes and then it sustains into the rest of the part) Seems like it gets drowned out a lot, Idk if that is because of the limiter, the eqing on it, or maybe its just not the right sound to help it cut through the mix.

I like it though man, keep up the good work!"
edmproduction,fji6i8s,t1_fjhg6lz,1583361430.0,"First listen through: The track is solid but has a lot of room for you to make cool stuff happen in a track, and I think that is what this is missing: Variation.

Clap needs a little love effect wise, because its loud and dry

0:20 the clap could use a little more reverb or something to dampen it up, maybe lower it in the mix here so it falls in line and there is less focus on the clap, and more on the kick and the wubs.

0:29 the arps that come up here along with the noise sweep could use some volume to bring it to the forefront and sound more like a riser than ambience. 

In the drops try experimenting with different synths to liven it up.

That little pew noise around 3:01 is really loud and clips a bit, probably should bring that down.

Overall I think the tune is a great framework , you have a good setting for the track, the ambience needs to be higher, its not muddy at all from what I can hear. But keep that in mind for the next track! Keep working at it man, you're on the right path."
edmproduction,fji57zk,t1_fjhp2sv,1583360819.0,"So on the first listen through, the composition is pretty solid, it sounds like you put a lot of thought into keeping it clean and minimalistic which I like. 

About 1:32 the clap sounds off feels out of place for the drop its pretty dry(in terms of effects), maybe do some stuff with the break a bit to spice it up.

2:26 the synth that follows the lead sounds like it clashes with the vox until the drop hits

The second ""drop"" could use some variation on the guitar to keep it fresh

the synth melody at 1:33 is a bit quiet, could use some gain here to keep it prominent in the mix, and maybe more variation

Outside of that its a solid track, and those little things I have mentioned are minor problems that I think would just improve on to  take the track from good to great! Nice work dude."
