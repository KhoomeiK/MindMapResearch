All of this madness was started under the guise of the ""War on Drugs"" (which has ironically caused drug cartels to explode in power and influence) and will only get worse as the US progresses in its march towards fascism. 

The semi-recent bombings, bombing attempts, and vehicular manslaughter sprees leave me with little faith that banning guns will do much of anything to curb the decades-long violence epidemic that's gripping the US. It's been long overdue for America to come to terms with its violent, hateful culture that not only encourages mass violence but makes it inevitable. 

In America, gun violence in movies gets you a PG-13 rating, while sex scenes and discussion of sexuality get you an R rating. Don't you think it's a little backwards that our culture views our natural, in-built sexuality as more taboo than killing people? 

I've read the manifestoes of multiple mass shooters, and they all have one thing in common: they're full of hate and anger towards the world which was harnessed and made into violent action by fascists. For example, the El Paso shooter was an ecofascist looking to kill immigrants. 

I think that it would be more productive to use social welfare programs to reduce crime of all kinds by lifting people out of poverty, to crack down on fascist groups to prevent alienated, atomized people from being radicalized, and to create social outreach programs to prevent people from being alienated or atomized by capitalism and to strengthen the social fabric of our society.

politics,fmv289s,t1_fmukflk,1586404260.0,"You're forgetting that most of the people disillusioned enough to not vote for Joe Biden are also disillusioned enough to not vote in the primaries. In fact, most people don't vote in any primaries. Joe Biden already has the lion's share of all the votes he will ever get, while Trump only currently has the votes of Trump supporters who bother to vote in the primaries. 

Of course, Bernie Sanders wasn't a perfect candidate, and he personally shares some blame for his loss. He was a populist candidate with populist appeal who spent what little air time he was given sucking up to the establishment that his supporters hated (I mean, he called Joe Biden his friend for fuck's sake) instead of doubling down on the populism to draw in more disillusioned people. The revelation that Joe Biden finger-raped Tara Reade was the perfect opportunity for Bernie to voice opposition to both Biden and to the establishment that enabled that scumbag without it appearing like petty mudslinging. That was Bernie's chance to eat his cake and have it too because he could preserve his ""nice, civil politician"" persona while making a populist stance against rape culture and by extension the neoliberal establishment. Instead, he continued to insist the Joe Biden is a good person (yikes). 

That being said, saying that partisan insiders had nothing to do with Bernie's loss is patently false, and can only be genuinely believed by someone living in a fantasy world. The same billionaires who fund the DNC also own major ""news"" outlets like MSNBC and CNN, and can thus instruct them to ignore certain topics or to only cover a topic in a certain way. That means that the people who fund and effectively own the DNC can make the news outlets they own manufacture the consent of the DNC's voters by bombarding them with propaganda aimed to convince them to vote for the candidates already selected by the billionaire owners. [Some More News made a great video showing what this looks like in practice, and how Bernie Sanders has faced the brunt of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmBHwjoIFNM). This isn't even a conspiracy theory, as they do it openly. No one's trying to hide anything, as thanks to our effective lack of campaign finance laws, all of this is perfectly legal, thus there's nothing to hide. 

Furthermore, don't you find it at least a little bit suspicious that every single establishment democrat still in the race rallied behind specifically Joe Biden (who was floundering in the polls at the time) at the precise moment that Bernie Sanders got even a little bit of a lead? This was the corporate-owned and operated establishment cracking down on the populist movement headed by Bernie. They knew this would work because most Americans are low information voters who get most of their political information from corporate-owned news, so seeing a bunch of names and faces they recognize and think they like voice support for another name and face they think they like from the Obama Presidency (and you liked, Obama didn't you? so why wouldn't you like someone from his administration?). 

Because of how uninformed the average American voter is, the corporate media owners knew that they could create the ""electability"" lie and just say that Biden will support progressive causes while omitting his exceptionally reactionary record and uninformed people would buy it hook-line-and-sinker. It's also no coincidence that the vast majority of Biden voters are from the same age demographic that watches the most TV news. 

I bet at this point you're probably wondering why anyone would go through all of this, and the answer is disappointingly simple. You see, Bernie Sanders' tax plan would drastically raise the taxes paid by the superwealthy, so the billionaire media and party owners are using their properties to ensure that this doesn't happen. That's right, Bernie got ratfucked because a few disgustingly rich people didn't want to pay their fair share.

>Acts 2:44-45, ""All who believed were together and had all things in common; 45 they would sell their possessions and goods and distribute the proceeds to all, as any had need."" 

>Acts 4:32-35, ""Now the whole group of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one claimed private ownership of any possessions, but everything they owned was held in common. ... 34 There was not a needy person among them, for as many as owned lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold. 35 They laid it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to each as any had need."" 

Not to mention Jesus' overall disdain for the wealthy (""it's easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God""), his hatred of proto-capitalist merchants (Jesus making his own cat-o-nine-tails with which he whipped merchants for selling their merchandise in a temple), and his questioning of private and state property rights (""Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's"" but what belongs to Caesar?). 

The idea of a classless, stateless society is perhaps as old as humanity itself, and the idea of workers owning the means of production is perhaps as old as the first means of production: agricultural tools and fertile land."

ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,flzrek4,t1_flyg7s3,1585631254.0,"I guess you've forgotten that the 2016 election saw only ~%55.4 eligible voter turn out (a 20 year low), which means that the largest voter demographic in America is the ~%44.6 who don't vote. That means that Hillary being a shitty, unappealing candidate was ***the reason*** why she lost because she couldn't entice the people who usually never vote into voting. 

Why do these people never vote? They never vote because they've either been disillusioned by the neoliberal establishment that they rightly feel doesn't represent them and only represents the interests of wealthy capitalists, or because they've been disenfranchised by the plethora of voter suppression methods that have been only strengthened over the last few decades. 

To reach these voters, we need to give them something new: actual change which benefits them in clear, direct ways. This is why we've seen a dramatic rise in both left-wing and right-wing populism as more and more people are fed up with the establishment and are thus increasingly desperate for some change. 

This is how Trump won. He actually addressed the people who have felt ignored by the system. Sure, all he did was give them someone to look down on and project all of their failings on to while he robs them blind, but that's far more than the fuck-all that every Democrat since Jimy Carter has done for them. It's really no wonder that Trump was able to so quickly cultivate such a strong and rabid personality cult, as at least he (briefly) acknowledged these people's existence. 

This is also why so many young people are gravitating towards Bernie Sanders, as he's the only one who has consistently proposed actual, workable solutions to the problems we face today, which young people will face the brunt of. The last thing we need is yet another geriatric, neoliberal ghoul who only wants to maintain the status quo that's ruined the lives of millions of people across the country, as at least in the minds of the politically disengaged, fascism is indistinguishable from neoliberalism. Either way, things will only get worse for them. The only noticeable difference is in how quickly things will get worse, which is a difference lost on anyone who's disengaged enough to not vote.

Take note of the fact that none of the deaths caused by Stalin or Mao were because of socialism, and were instead caused by their wrath, stupidity, paranoia, racism, or avarice. When you add in all of the non-holocaust-related deaths Hitler caused in WWII, purges, and incited riots (such as the Kristallnacht and Beer Hall Putsch), his death toll absolutely eclipses both Stalin's and Mao's combined.

Frankly, the only way I've managed to stay sane to significantly lower my expectations of what I hope to get out of life and to accept that some things are up to us and other things are not. After all, death comes for us all eventually, so I may as well just focus on the present if the only way to avoid the immanant destruction of all complex life on Earth for at least the next ten million years is a revolution that's both highly unlikely and even less likely to succeed. 

I find that there is a strange sort of peace in climate absurdism, as it's better to accept things made inevitable long before we were born than to bury your head in the false optimism that you will achieve the unachievable, no matter the odds, or that some piece of technology will save us all.
