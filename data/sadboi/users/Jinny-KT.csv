depression,fo71j4g,t1_fm3z5ez,1587570605.0,"No, I feel like my family doctor is just not very specialized or good at with handling mental health conditions, so I’ve just stopped speaking to her about my those problems, only talk to her if I have anything my physical. She also cares for my whole family so despite hoping she would perform best confidentiality practices, I just don’t feel comfortable enough to say anything anymore. 

After that whole incidence, I sought out to my school for psychiatric for help and the assigned psychiatrist was great. 
I have graduated since then so lost the access unfortunately, so currently in the process of finding a new psychiatrist. Been doing fine so far by myself except for a couple of episodes but should be okay. *fingers crossed* 

Feel like I’m just dumped a whole complaint here, haha.. sorry. Thanks for asking though."
depression,fo6ziku,t1_fm43rdc,1587569584.0,"Yeah, exactly.

I know (I hope) my friends would never mean for harm and this is all just a communication issue, but I don’t feel like what you mentioned were too much of an asks. Like, if I tell anything to you (you as in my friends), I’m literally opening my wounds up, the least you can do is to not pour salt. 

My boyfriend, who is my lifeline now, has learned that just listening and patiently wait/accompany is the best way to support me. He used to say the same things to me and it took so long to communicate that “changing perspective” is not a constructive solution. So the positive note is that it’s a learnt process our loved ones can adopt.

———————————————————-

We all know what we need to do is to actually educate our loved ones but dilemma here is that it requires for us to be even more vulnerable which we can’t afford. 

It’s just a shit cycle of -
“I have to tell you to avoid actually getting hurt next time” 

BUT...

“I’m afraid to tell you anything cuz I’m terrified of being more vulnerable and you’ve hurt me once already, intentional or not.”





Sighhhhh, I’m just... ranting, frustrated how I am and how things work in my head."

So if these want to get the sad virus so bad, maybe they should go to China because that’s probably max chance."

depression,fm3r7oc,t3_fsnem5,1585733941.0,"I cut myself too, I don’t know why you do it but I found my urge comes when everything seems to be out of control for me and I start panicking. Seeing blood makes me feel in control and a whole lot better. 

I’ve been actively trying to manage this control situation with other ways (crying, biting nail, biting hand, digging nail into skin, lying in shower with steaming hot water pouring on me) and tell myself that I always fall back into cutting if whatever I’m doing doesn’t work but try them first. Even just know that I still can cut myself makes me feel a little more in control already. Last time I cut myself was the past Saturday night (after I’ve exhausted everything else), but before that was a good 3 years ago.

One thing not to do is to bang head hard against the wall, I got a really bad concussion and for the week, I couldn’t stop feeling nauseous. 

I’m hoping one day I’ll develop the habit of doing something positive or maybe productive for control coping, like exercising or cooking. So far, I can’t seem to remotely want to do any of them when I’m going into an episode."
depression,fm3qele,t3_fsrj6s,1585733081.0,"I also hate it when this friend told me that I just needed to “change perspective”. Like nooooo we all didnt already know that and of course it’s soooo easy to fix. He made it sound like I actually want to feel sad and cry myself to sleep every night or like I don’t already know all these thoughts are just in my head. Seriously, fuck off. I’m feeling like shit everyday, I don’t need you to minimize my feelings and make me feel stupid with your amazing new solution that no ones thought of - just “change perspective”. 

This shit really sucks and they don’t understand...  I wish they could but I pray they never will, because it really fucking sucks."

depression,fm3nhea,t1_fm2puug,1585729913.0,"One time I felt so broken that I showed my cut wounds to my mom, she shoved my sleeve down and said don’t show this to dad. I could tell she was ashamed of me, so I never brought it up again. 

I don’t understand why my doctor kept insisting  that I tell my parents about my depression. It’s not like I was already ashamed and scared enough already, that I needed more anxiety from my mom..."
depression,flt5yqh,t1_flt3k81,1585460327.0,"You’re right, I’ve been making friends just to be friends, I try very hard too. Often find myself doing things I don’t like just to be with them. I have a hard time trusting and telling people my problems (hence posting my problems on reddit), so having friends probably wouldn’t help with that. I guess maybe it’s just I’ve yet to find proper compatibility, but the dilemma nests itself in getting beaten down during the process of the search and trial for compatible friends. Can’t seem to justify the pain anymore, not having friends feels easier and painless than looking for that needle in the haystack compatible friend."
depression,flt10xy,t3_fqq038,1585456093.0,"Haha... I literally just deactivated everything and cried for half an hour lying in the bathtub with really hot water jetting at me just to numb everything. I make friends and go on social media because I’m lonely, then some occasions being on or having “friends” makes me feel even lonelier than without so then I run away. But I always go back when I hurt less due to loneliness,  then I get hurt again, and the toxic cycle repeats itself."
depression,flszuyv,t1_fkes01h,1585455162.0,I think people just want to be acknowledged. I don’t think op expected a therapist out of his friend but a simple acknowledgement after all the courage put in to open up.
