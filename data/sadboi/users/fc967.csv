adultery,fq69go6,t3_ggqao9,1589127177.0,My boys gave me flowers earlier in the week which I loved!!  This morning I made breakfast like I usually do as the kids have part-time jobs.  SO gave me a card with $$ in it and later today we'll order carry out.  AP sent me a Mother's Day message which was nice.   Received an email from an AP from YEARS back and wondering WTH he wants.   Still feel sad that SO and I don't have a real marriage.  It's more like a business type/mom relationship and he's like a 10 year old.
adultery,fpkptft,t3_ge0vlh,1588698938.0,"I agree..  It does suck..  Have a lot to be grateful for BUT staying at home since March is tough.   The weather is cool and gloomy, etc.... I hope soon we'll be able to do 'normal' things."
cats,fph72ft,t3_gdae2g,1588616110.0,I agree and want a kitten myself!!   We have 2--- one older (about 8) and the other one is about     2..   The young one is small and feisty and the older one doesn't really want to play so I figured if I got a kitten they MIGHT become best buds.
adultery,fph6la4,t3_gdcqj0,1588615869.0,"Yes!!! It has nothing to do with my AP but I've felt this way for over a year.  I absolute hate Fridays but by Sunday nite/Monday, I'm ok.     We really need to divorce because I think we are both miserable even thou he will not admit it.  I have no idea how we will manage if  retirement comes--  perhaps at the time we will own 2 places."
relationships,fpdcklx,t3_gchg56,1588524325.0,"Wow so many good answers about protecting your own bank account!!!   I would close out that acct and get a new one at different bank with all the stops so that he won't do this ever!!    Not sure I would divorce but certainly would feel hurt, used, violated, etc... Certainly get a new account, make him for the bills and repay you back!!!"
adultery,fpbe4a8,t3_gcfvir,1588467912.0,Yep...   March 16 started lockdown and I was in control.  Exercising each day-blah blah blah..  But with all the cooking I've been doing and lots of desserts kids make--  I've been eating and NOT exercising at all!!  Each morning I say that I'm going to do a water fast or just eat protein and veggies but it just doesn't happen.   Gotta do it cuz I'm sure in June I'll see AP.

adultery,fp9zr4a,t3_gbj6l5,1588437910.0,Just be patient..  This stay at home order has me turned around....  I've been focusing on cooking and cleaning and keeping the peace in this house.  I've also been eating a little too much so really I don't have alot to say to AP..   Just not a priority now--- We email here and there and once restrictions are lifted I'm sure we'll meet up then.  The other day he said that he misses 'my body'  -- I'm like I miss going to the pool and my old routine..  So my mind is just not there now.  I'm sure she'll come around once this has cooled down.
aww,fp9yoxm,t3_gc4whb,1588437297.0,Oh my goodness...  he is so freakin' cute!!!  Like everyone else says small steps.    Kept mine in the basement (cozy finished) for a couple days cause I didn't want to overwhelm him.  He doesn't like to be held but I do try everyday...  A few minutes over my shoulder and then he wants down.  : (

We are on year 7 and he used to surprise me with small gifts-- really liked that too..  : )  Not sure you need a 'gift' for the first date.  An Ex-ap gave me a single rose with a handwritten card on our first lunch date.  I kept the ribbon from the flower and the card.

So now I don't talk with her much..  If I do, it's general stuff..   But yep, I'm lonely and have had several sex dreams!!   I have had an AP for YEARS but in the mood to find another one.  SO is just another kid-- I so want someone for me-- I'm tired of sneaking around..   I also miss going to the pool.  The pool is so soothing to me.. UGH  I'm also eating more than I did which I absolute hate!!!"
adultery,fo400vb,t3_g5fml7,1587495860.0,"SO was this way before covid--  narcissist--no mental/ emotional connection..  His anxiety is sky-high.  Every day he's got something wrong with him-- sore throat, can't sleep, headache, etc, etc.... It seems like every 2 or 3 days he calls his doctor, online doctor or pharmacist for information or even a script for something.  I wish I could get my hands on some zoloft  to give him cuz I need a fuckin' break!!"
adultery,fnwvdov,t3_g46lsj,1587326196.0,You can find someone else so you won't have awful sex forever.  My AP and I were talking about how we lasted so long (7 years).   He said (thru email) that not getting emotional was the key..  WHAT??   Then he said it's mostly what's between the ears as beauty only goes so far.  WTF  I'm a little pissed and I should find myself another AP!!!
adultery,fnr0w9l,t1_fnqt02z,1587176630.0,"I see... and it could!!   Looking back at my past relationships, I felt as thou I got bored easily which could be all about me.  2 were really nice successful men which my family couldn't understand why I broke up---or just started dating others.  And 'that' has followed me here in my marriage now.  They say some ppl aren't made to be monogamous--I guess I'm not one of them."
adultery,fnp4pup,t3_g2xorx,1587139174.0,"Wow, no kids ?   I would leave..   So much easier as you don't have to worry about their feelings and feel responsible for them just yourself..  Being stuck in this house with him is very taxing.  No way in hell can I retire with him (unless of course we have 2 places!!)"
adultery,fnjphkg,t3_g25xdl,1587003999.0,You are not alone!!!   I'm very resentful too--  I hate that our president put us thru this shit.  I miss my old routine.  Kids are fine but they do push the envelope with gaming and bedtimes.  Spouse has bad anxiety which is making me unhinged..
adultery,fnikfsr,t3_g1r8gs,1586981541.0,Yes and no...   I think it could be me as my hormones go up and down..  But then he could 'up' his game too.

We do talk about our life, kids and SO.   But every now and then he spills about what his wife gets or that he spent so much money on his daughters wedding or even a European vacay..  OK, this is fine BUT one day it would be nice to splurge on me!!  Yes he gets a nice room and always has wine too BUT would be nice to have something else!!"

adultery,fmnbm95,t3_fw86da,1586222403.0,I would say no contact for awhile so that AP and daughter can talk..   There was a time that I thought my son knew so I stopped using my phone/computer for awhile..

I've been chatting with an ex-AP  just to compare notes with the family during this virus--  what he is doing and what I""m doing-- it's all good.

adultery,fmdj0sa,t3_fuiwhe,1585969073.0,"Yes I agree..  It will be ok..  I don't talk with my AP everyday and it's all good.   We email/text when we can as we are both have families...   Doesn't mean that we will never see each other, it could be next month.  Just take it as it comes and yes to more lunges and squats."
HumansBeingBros,fmd2w61,t3_fuft05,1585958124.0,Yes...   I loved this guy in the 80's with posters all over my wall of his sexy- self!!   Lived in NJ at the time so I saw so many of his concerts!!  I've known about his kitchens in NJ-- But this picture is awesome.   During the virus he is helping others..  So many people are without food and he is certainly doing his part...

I love kissing my AP and he says he loves it too because of the passion we have.  AP says that's all him and wify do is peck kisses which is like how you kiss your grandmother."
adultery,fm1p3z9,t3_fsh8ga,1585682468.0,"AM works..  That's how I meet my APs and most are genuine  nice guys.   Although, I did jump on the other day and I agree it was pathetic.   I never knew about the filter of nasty pics as I just delete or block them off the bat.  And yes to MANY older men WOW..  Again, I just delete those off the bat too.

Marriage,flz4skt,t3_frswpq,1585615518.0,"aww   yes, I'm sure it's hard on him. I was laid-off last week then 2 days later they said I could still stay which I think was due to the 'bill' they just passed..   But yes I'm sure he feels extremely bad.  Just keep reminding him that it's not his fault as many are in  the same situation and that you really appreciate the work he's doing around the house.  There are places that need workers--- grocery stores, walmart, drivers, etc.."

This is your decision of course since you are a single mom to 2 kids and will be taking care of all 3. Don't feel guilty about your decision.

BUT she then told me months later that her and her hubby still have sex often--  so I guess that's their glue.   My marriage isn't great at all-- he's more like an annoying younger brother.
