But I think part of it for me, is that for some reason I keep finding myself in friendships with people that takes advantage of me, or betrays me in some way. I've had friends steal money from me, I've had friends steal my romantic interests or partners, I've had friends suddenly drop the friendship and befriend other people that treated me badly and literally caused me to be hospitalized because of their torment. I've had relationships with people stringing me along. And a lot more..

I've had a very bad childhood with extreme bullying, abuse, and narcissistic parents. And I think that is the main catalyst to most of my problems, it has damaged me in many ways, and is probably the reason I keep finding myself in these situations with bad people who let me down. The surprising thing is that some of these friendships were actually very healthy ones until a betrayal of some sort happened suddenly. 

I dont know, I think I just choose the wrong people, or I sabotage things myself somehow. I don't know how to stop it, and it has caused me to have very big trust issues, so I push people away. It's just a spiralling black hole, continuing to hurt myself in the end."

That doesn't mean bisexuals stigmatize against non-binary people at all. It just means that their attracted to people based on the gender.

Draw with different tools - coal, markers, pastels, ink and so on. You can even mix it, what results does that give you? What works the best for you?

Work with a mix of your collage work and drawings - I think this could be real fun for you! As you do both a lot.

Give yourself an assignment. Choose a subject, a word, a movie, a book, could even be the coronavirus, and make a whole project inspired by that. Moodboard, shape and textile research, and then a lot of different investigative drawings which will end out in more and more finished designs in the end.

Myself I got accepted my second time applying, which is still very good considering my school only accept 30 people a year and is among the top ten design schools in the world.

capsulewardrobe,fmoc6ja,t1_fmo5ug5,1586253487.0,"This is actually kind of why I wrote this post, because I am not home right now, I'm with family in quarantine. And having less clothes have been a blessing. Theres some things I miss because I layer a lot when styling my clothes and I'm like ""damn I need that cardigan/blazer/kimono"". And then I've been missing some strange statement pieces, but also just my loungewear because nobody is looking at me right now, except family, and I feel a little silly looking colorful every day."
capsulewardrobe,fmmlfdk,t1_fmmka3z,1586207425.0,"I actually already kinda do this a bit, I have a lot of my winter clothes packed away when it's summer and vise versa. Especially because where I live there's a very big difference in temperatures. Thank god for my storage room in the basement of my duplex. Otherwise I wouldn't have room for storage.

But yeah I think my problem in general is that I need to be way more harsh when sorting my clothes. The thing is that I actually do use most of it even though I have a lot."
capsulewardrobe,fmmkmuw,t1_fmmk6xv,1586206998.0,I like this Idea! Plus I have a love for dresses and pantsuits.
Fashion_Design,fmls3el,t1_fmlfpcp,1586192198.0,Watching a video is not the same as seeing a real person/shape. That's why croquis is so unique. But just drawing a friend with clothes on (or someone more intimate you can get naked.) Helps a whole lot too.
Fashion_Design,fml83pp,t3_fvs8ow,1586180892.0,I recommend taking croquis classes if you wanna get better at drawing the human body. Helped me a lot before making my portfolio and applying.

But as I got older my style evolved and I brought humor into the mix, so now even when I'm writing about things that makes me feel sad I still try and have some kind of way to laugh about it and be a little sarcastic with it.

Dark humor can help a lot when things feel shitty, and its healthy to laugh at yourself at times."

If we keep the sick quarantined I think we can stop it before then, at least here in Denmark if we keep our boarders shut, because our country is not that big and we have very good resources.

""COPENHAGEN, Denmark ‚Äì This is what it‚Äôs like to live in Denmark, a nation with a narrower wealth gap than almost anywhere else: You‚Äôve been jobless for more than a year. You have no university degree, no advanced skills. You have to pay a mortgage. And your husband is nearing retirement.

You aren‚Äôt worried.

If you‚Äôre 51-year-old Lotte Geleff, who lost her job as an office clerk in January 2013, you know you‚Äôll receive an unemployment benefit of 10,500 kroner ($1,902) a month after taxes for up to two years. You‚Äôre part of a national system of free health care and education for everyone, job training, subsidized child care, a generous pension system and fuel subsidies and rent allowances for the elderly..."""
