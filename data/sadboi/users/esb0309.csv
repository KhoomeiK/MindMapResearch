MultipleSclerosis,fqrcjji,t3_gkhubq,1589581705.0,"Hi I have had neuropsychological testing twice. Once when I was diagnosed in 2012 and again a few months ago
The first test was at a major university and was partially on a computer (this part went on forever), the puzzles, drawing and answering questions 
The most recent test was at a private doctor’s office and was not on the computers but all with tests, puzzles, questions etc
The first test was about 5-6 hours and the second about 4
 I did think that I was having attention and memory issues in 2012 along with word finding problems
I was diagnosed with a mild cognitive impairment

This past year’s testing was to establish a baseline as my symptoms have worsened significantly 
The doctor said that I have cognitive slowing that is causing a perception of memory and attention difficulties as I am having problems with processing

I did find the testing reassuring as it confirmed my symptoms and made me feel like I wasn’t “crazy”

The testing is no big deal, just long

My relationship has been terrible since childhood.
My mother, aunt and uncle are anorexic.
My sister had bulimia and binge eating disorder and is very overweight.
Eating issues are so ingrained in my family that at times it is all consuming.
Everyone comments on others eating habits and physical appearance all the time.
My mother overfeeds others and starved herself and the. Becomes angry if others don’t eat “enough”

I was in an abusive marriage for 10 years and my ex and his family also would comment about my appearance and Would tell me that I had gained to much weight and that I shouldn’t eat anymore
My ex would cheat on me all the time and I never felt attractive enough for him

I have gained 15 lbs this year and 30lbs in the last 2 years due to my complete obsession with weight and yo-yo dieting

When I am manic I think I am amazing so I will eat anything and eat/bake/cook too much

When I’m depressed I hate myself and am so down on myself due to my perception that my worth is only based on my physical appearance 

I pray one day this changes

I will look into getting one and I’m hopeful it will help. That is wonderful that even after removing the brace that you are still having a carry over effect.

My current neuro is not an MS specialist. He has a ton of MS patients as he has been practicing forever.
I was seeing an MS specialist at a university that is almost three hours away as those near me had a long (year plus) wait time. The drive was just too much as I would need someone to take me and it was a whole day event.
I returned to this neuro as he was the one who originally diagnosed me when I was inpatient 8 years ago. Afterwards I bounced around to a few different doctors and was misdiagnosed with myasthenia. I returned to him as he was right from the beginning about my diagnosis.
I do agree with you that there is a big difference between MS specialists and regular neuros as far as the knowledge of disease course , treatment options etc.
I am hesitant to change as he agreed with the MS specialist and is continuing my Ocrevus
I just wish however he didn’t just shrug his shoulders at symptoms (other than when really severe).

My balance just seems to be getting worse in the past month so I will definitely look into what you have suggested

I would call your neurologist and let them know if it is not typical for you

Good luck and I hope you feel better soon!"
MultipleSclerosis,fif25dn,t3_f7sohn,1582384836.0,"I also found it interesting that they said this. I have unfortunately seen a ridiculous amount of doctors (Mayo/Cleveland etc) as there are very few POTS clinics in the US (I am waiting to hear back from Vanderbilt right now)
At least three-four neurologists/cardiologists that I have seen have been pretty dismissive of what I thought would be a direct correlation
 just assumed that it was due to the nerve damage
and I had read in the past that there could be some correlation
Perhaps at a true POTS clinic (like Vanderbilt) they might have more insight
As far as I understand POTS can be triggered by something but it also can have a genetic component. There is actually a blood test from Mayo that I had done that was for genetic Dysautonomia but I was negative
I think viruses, illnesses, extremely stressful events etc can also cause symptoms to begin
For me, everything (MS and POTS) all started at pretty much the same time which was a very stressful emotional/physical time
Most doctors don’t seem to really understand POTS even neuro/cardiologist etc"

I have Hyperadrenergic POTS and MS I was diagnosed in 2012 with “autonomic dysfunction “ with the autonomic testing after multiple syncopal episodes and tachycardia 
It got worse over the years and this past August I had the testing redone and it showed Hyperadrenergic POTS
I have been on beta blockers since 2012 and I was on Midodrine as well for years until recently 
Aside from the testing which includes the tilt table portion to confirm diagnosis 
You can monitor your heart rate  at home so that you can collect data to present to the doctor
As far as symptom management Mayo and Cleveland Clinic both said to hydrate as much as possible (I  suggest Ultima replenisher I buy it on amazon to increase electrolytes but of course ask the doctor)
Exercise and compression stockings also help
I would suggest looking at the Dinet website they have a lot of information and resources 
All of the doctors I have seen said that there is no direct link between MS and POTS which seems odd to me. They said that it is possible but in end stage MS with brain stem involvement
I don’t know sounds strange to me that they wouldn’t be linked

Best of luck and please let me know if you have any questions!"
POTS,fdldyia,t3_elw0ln,1578521971.0,"It’s a longer drive but I received my diagnosis at Cleveland Clinic in Weston near Ft. Lauderdale
It was the full autonomic test (Tilt Table , QSART, Valsalva etc
They were helpful
Best of luck to you!"

I feel like I sometimes live a whole life in my mind that I am physically incapable of making come to fruition.
I try to restructure my days so that I can rest before or after an activity like mall/grocery store etc. it doesn’t always work and some days I am forced to cancel certain plans.

I know I need to accept where I am right now but it can be hard

I wish you the best and hope everything gets easier for you"

dysautonomia,fcxcx6h,t3_ejc35s,1578059524.0,"I saw an MD who also practiced functional medicine for about a year. She was very kind and thorough however between my appointments, specialty testing and supplements it cost me about $8,000-$10,000 in a year.

The testing all ran $150-$400 per test for specialty testing for nutritional allergies, mold, digestive issues etc.

In a year she recommended about 20 different supplements.

Unfortunately nothing (other than her sending me to a fantastic acupuncturist for a different health issue) helped .

I am not saying that functional medicine does not have a purpose or place in healthcare. I have a friend who got relief from a severe autoimmune disease from functional medicine practices.

Personally, it did not help me physically and after a year of attempts I stopped seeing this physician.

I wish you the best!"
MultipleSclerosis,fcovx9t,t3_eibczq,1577843036.0,"Hi! I am sorry you are having to deal with this. I have swallowing issues (primarily swallowing before the actual swallow is triggered)
I also have issues when I attempt a continuous swallow
I have tried avoiding straws and drinking slowly and it helps but sometimes hard to remember to do so

Have you had a swallow study? A speech pathologist would be the best to help
I have had two different types of swallow studies and even though it was uncomfortable they were more able to see the issue with the fiber optic tube
I hope that you get some answers I know it can be uncomfortable and disconcerting 
Best wishes!"

I have had multiple home infusions since being on Medicare-steroids, IVIG  to hydration etc
And I haven’t had a bill
I think the advantage plans have been really worth it I would highly recommend it
Also my meds are all very inexpensive with the advantage plan most under $20 and only 1 name brand med is over $40
Let me know if you have any questions 
Good luck!"

Do you have an “advantage plan” I have a Medicare “advantage or supplement “ plan and I have had multiple infusions at home 
I would typically have the supplies delivered by a company and the nurses would be from a separate company.
Everything was always covered at 100% 
I would suggest calling and finding out the names of supply companies on your plan
I hope it all works out good luck!"
POTS,f8wr056,t1_f8wb5tn,1574897585.0,"Hi! I was happy with the care at Mayo and the experience of the coordinated care was great. I had applied for both Vanderbilt and Mayo but Mayo called first so I went. They did not repeat any of my testing as all had been confirmed at Cleveland Clinic. I am interested in going to Vanderbilt if I am accepted because Mayo’s POTS treatment program is only for patients 18-30. They did recommend a Fibromyalgia program that they said is also used for POTS patients but I am confused about the Fibromyalgia element as that is not something I have.
The doctors (neurologists) at Mayo spent a very long time with me and were great but aside from beta blockers that I was already on they only recommended lifestyle modifications.
I am working on implementing all of those but I am still having a lot of symptoms.

I would definitely recommend Mayo it was a very positive experience.
I am still trying to find a treatment plan that works best.
Please let me know if you would like any more info about Mayo
Best wishes!"
POTS,f8vc5uw,t3_e1mbbz,1574865788.0,"Hi I had one telemedicine appointment earlier this year and I decided not to proceed with treatment. 
Instead I visited Mayo in MN and I am waiting to hear back from Vanderbilt.

I felt very uncomfortable as he prescribed 4 meds via a telemedicine appointment (all “big” meds)

I have seen enough doctors to know that this is atypical 

Just my personal opinion.
I wish you the best"

dysautonomia,f72b64o,t1_f6zx3tq,1573357601.0,"Hi thanks for your response I’m sorry that you are dealing with all of this

I have had a hard time getting doctors to accept that it can occur in different positions
As I had a positive tilt they did diagnose POTS but basically said they didn’t have an explanation for syncopal episodes occurring in other positions 
They did mention they might want to check my levels of catecholamines but that has not yet occurred 
Thanks and be well"
dysautonomia,f721oe7,t1_f6y4oeh,1573352096.0,"Hi yes it was the Mayo Autoimmune Dysautonomia panel
The doctor had been suspicious that my POTS was autoimmune in nature as I have two other autoimmune diseases
However, the panel was negative

dysautonomia,f6wkz3e,t1_f6v6p1h,1573228983.0,"Hi thanks! I appreciate your reply
The doctors I have seen have seemed confused by this (I’m not sure why)
They said that even though I had a positive tilt and it is typically when standing/walking it has happened sometimes extremely when sitting

One doctor said that it “had” to be autoimmune due to this but I subsequently tested negative on the Mayo panel

I appreciate your help and be well!"
POTS,f4o6ycv,t1_f4jv4g4,1571697296.0,Thank you! Yikes 4 weeks is too long for me to be away from home. I am hopeful that they can come up with some medication ideas and put the whole picture together (I have some autoimmune issues as well)
POTS,f4dcsor,t1_f4cwxht,1571540871.0,"Thank you so much I truly appreciate all of the information! I’m glad that it was such a positive experience for you and that the medical staff was so kind and helpful.

I did not have a great experience at the Cleveland Clinic and ended up in the ER three times in a week after the autonomic testing.

I really do like the model of seeing all the physicians in the same place and them being able to review each other’s notes and testing.
I would love to have all the doctors capable of working together as it has been confusing having different specialists in various places.

I had called for an appointment at the Mayo in Florida where I live but they told me that I would have to see cardiology there but no appointments were available.
After I called Rochester there wanted me to see a neurologist who specializes in MS and autonomic dysfunction

I am hopeful that this experience will be positive and will reveal some new information and treatment options.

Thanks again I appreciate your help and all of the information!"
POTS,f4db6ua,t1_f4crkvm,1571540257.0,"Wow 2 weeks is a long time! I’m sure that was very difficult. As of right now they only prescheduled the autonomic testing so I’m hopeful that it should only take a week. They did mention that the doctor might refer to another specialist or recommend other testing.
Did you find that the physicians were helpful with recommending treatment?
Thank you!"
POTS,f4cs7gi,t1_f4cqhu2,1571533202.0,"Yes thanks they told me that I was having “autonomic reflex testing” I asked the nurse if this was Tilt Table/Valsalva/QSART as I had in Cleveland Clinic
She told me she was unsure about the Tilt being included. I felt very ill at Cleveland Clinic after the tilt portion
They told me that I had to hold my beta blocker for 48 hour
Did you have this testing done there? How did you find the physicians?
Also, do you exclusively see the physician there or do you have a doctor closer to home?
Thank you!!"
