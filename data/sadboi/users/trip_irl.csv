I lived down in the basement and so it had to come from outside. So I thought it was someone just messing with me so I knocked back and it happened again. So i was like alright, who is it? so i opened my window and nobody was there. My dad and his friend were only on the deck sitting and talking so I knew it wasn't them. Never had it happen again after that."

NonBinary,eyltql1,t3_cx8si2,1567191779.0,"The thing is, people see going to be a bit confused and it'll take some work. But they've supported your decisions up this point and it's made you happy. And if going as Rowan and having they/them pronouns is what makes you happy and feel even more comfortable. Then I think that's all that matters. It'll take some adjusting and it'll be hard. But it really matters if it's what you want. Then people will just need to accept it. Be who you are and be proud of it!! Life is too short to live in everybody's ideal vision. You could slowly start talking to them about it and help them understand a little bit more. 

I wish you the best of luck and endless good vibes ‚ô•Ô∏è you deserve to be happy and to be the person you want to be!"

I right now just identify as Non-binary and would use they/them terms üòä"
genderfluid,eyfjryc,t1_eyfjhmk,1567049905.0,It really is. It's so hard because I feel like I got to state myself as something. So I know and feel comfortable as it. But it could be that were taught and shown that way. But I try to just not think of labels and just keep living. It's so much stress to figure it out. Sexuality was enough but damn .. gender is a whole new spectrum
genderfluid,eyfj55n,t3_cvzml3,1567049595.0,"on the same boat!! it's such a confusing thing. I've thought endlessly on what I choose to be. Because even something like non-binary isn't enough to justify how I feel. I don't even conform to that üò´
But, the main thing is you don't have to set yourself as that if it doesn't apply. And you don't have to label yourself.
Also, there are lots of guys out there that are short. And isn't justified by having big feet or a jawline or how the eyebrows look. You are unique in your own way and that's amazing. Each person is different. Sending all love your way !!"

BipolarReddit,et7g40d,t1_et7f312,1562530678.0,"I did used to take lithium and also used to take seroquel. And then sometime hydroxyzine if it was bad. 

I felt really off on medication and didn't like how it made me feel. I was a completely different person. Not in a good way either. So I stopped taking them, even though my psychiatrist had told me that if I do I'd probably spiral into some heavy depression and end up doing things I regret. But it's been over a year now and haven't had any of that. My mania and depressive episodes and have become much and much lesser, I feel like a much better person.

BipolarReddit,et4x4d2,t3_c9ulyl,1562459356.0,"hey, I'm 19nb , but I understand. During highschool I was moderately popular. Everyone knew me and things were good. And then as the years went on and when I turned 16, that's when it really started to hit. At 14, I was diagnosed with depression and gave me meds, ended up making it works because at 16 I was properly diagnosed with bipolar. And I dealt with more of the depressive episodes of bipolar. I'd go weeks to a month just being depressed and angry. Extremely suicidal as well. And it pushed all the people in my life away because nobody wanted to deal with the moods. And now I've only got like a few people in my life that I care about. You find those who will stick with you through it"

bipolar,er3o2xm,t3_bleqnz,1560468092.0,"Going off of meds is always different for each person. The last time that I had seen my psychiatrist, she had told me that if I go off meds then I'll end up having a bad episode and get myself hurt or killed.

It's been about a year since that day. I haven't had any really had suicidal thoughts, long weeks of just depression. Some days are harder than others, but not as terrible as it used to be. 

Meds was just something I never could stay on top of, I messed up the schedule so many times. I didn't know the person I was when I was on meds. 
My head is so much clearer, mood swings are always there but not as brutal. I feel as if I got control over my illness for once."
