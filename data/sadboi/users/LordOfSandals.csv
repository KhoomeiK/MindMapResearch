BeginnerWoodWorking,ff4ze70,t3_eroiqt,1579576138.0,"Hi all, have a few questions.  I just got an amazing deal on this piano!  All of the guts are in incredible shape!  But the exterior needs to be refinished.  So any tips for that would be greatly appreciated.  
But the more immediate problem is that one of the legs broke during transport. 
It broke relatively clean in three pieces.  I have normally used tight bond 2 for my projects, but it does say not for load bearing applications.  Is there a better glue for clamping this back together?  Any thoughts are appreciated."
