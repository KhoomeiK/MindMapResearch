WarriorTV,eu4jze5,t3_be7vex,1563456127.0,"Im guessing the onion one comes from the saying 葱. Often used in context as 你算哪根葱 ( what sort of Spring Onion are you ).  

Spring onion is very easy to grow so it's deemed as cheap or low life . So asking ""What sort of spring onion are you "" is actually saying Who the F you think you are you piece of s**＊.  

As for duck. This is harder to guess. My best guess would be it comes from the saying 竹织鸭 in Cantonese which literally translated as Bamboo-weaved Duck,a traditional toy. This old saying usually followed by another sentence 冇心肝 (literally means heartless). Maybe the show simplified this slang to use it as a hassle to call white ppl ""Heartless cold b****es” .  

Of course in real life if you call any one onion or duck in Mandarin or Cantonese it would make no sense. Though duck in some Chinese dialects means male prostitutes we certainly don't use it to call white people."
