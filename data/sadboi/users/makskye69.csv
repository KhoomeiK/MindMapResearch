My last semester of my associates degree I sat next to a girl who was just like me, tattoos, alternative, not outwardly looking to socialize, etc. I thought about talking to her for weeks before I worked up the courage to. I think I told her I liked her tattoos or something. She ended up being one of my favorite college friends. Just go for it.

About three years ago I stopped smoking for six months. When I started again I pretty much never got my tolerance back and if I get too stoned I go straight into a panic attack, even though I've been smoking again for like two and a half years. 
I'd be careful with edibles, because they can easily make you too stoned. I usually take two hits off of whatever's going around and wait ten or fifteen minutes before continuing as a safeguard."

I'm fairly certain the only thing associated with panic attacks that can make you pass out is if your brain isn't getting enough oxygen, so even if you're panicking just make sure you're actually breathing and you should be fine."

I can't get rid of the physical symptoms which really really sucks, but I've been able to counter pretty much all the psychological ones.

Don't think that way. Almost four years later and I'm still trying to drink myself to death. 
The pain it causes cannot be compared to anything, and I would not wish it upon my worst enemy. Neither should you. Please."

I'm still affected by it nearly every day. 
I still cry over him. 
His family and friends were really horrible to me for a good long time, which made it all worse. 
I met one of my favorite human beings because of it, but I will never ever be the same."

This is not okay."
