I've been in one abuse situation or another for most of my life, and lupus isn't even in my family. I really think the years of stress just broke my immune system.

Emerald captains a ship with obvious military capabilities as well, and alludes to both ""imperial officers"" and/or ""elite Citrines"" guarding it. I don't know why the empire would have been developing (because the Sun Incinerator is one of a kind) superfast ships with shields and weaponry if there had been no fighting since the war on earth. And the gems guarding such a ship would probably be soldiers.

Edit: Okay, they actually explicitly refer to the Destiny Destroyer, the ship she's on, as a battleship. So yeah, Emeralds are also some kind of military.

Topazes might be soldiers as well. They're definitely designed for skilled fighting and not made solely on earth.

As for how Homeworld would have little comprehension of organic life if they'd repeatedly encountered it, this seems totally understandable. Look at Holly Blue. She had been living in a facility that housed intelligent organic lifeforms for hundreds of years but couldn't even recognize Steven's vocalizations as proper speech. Mainstream gems from the empire are so bigoted and stuck in their ways that they wouldn't recognize a sentient being if it literally shouted in their faces. Supremacy philosophies like that makes you real dumb.

And you're right that the series doesn't explicitly show organic aliens that are seemingly as intelligent as humans, but given how perfectly the other colonies went off, Homeworld's history censorship, and the little importance they place on anything other than gems, it would be totally unsurprising if they had successfully wiped out a couple civilizations pre- or post-earth and it didn't even occur to them to mention it."

The seemingly nicest people just roll out the most horrible justifications for why stuff must have happened to me.

The only way to minimize that is to come in bowing and scraping about how I know the people who abused me have a very stressful job, I'm sure there's two sides to the issue, it's not *all* doctors/nurses/orderlies etc, which is humiliating and makes me feel like I'm getting hurt all over again.

If your hair is curly or kinky, you have a much thinner cuticle layer than for other hair types and it's prone to chipping off--so the hair loses moisture much easier and becomes dry, which is doubly bad given that curly/kinky hair breaks easily because of the shape of the hair strand. 

If you're black and your hair is in its natural state, conditioner of some kind is a necessity unless you want your hair tangling, matting, or breaking off before it hits your shoulders.

That no rational person would deal with the fallout from this for no reason, basically. 

I really wish I’d gotten more of that from loved ones, because normally people do (very well-meaningly) only try to offer solutions and it gets exhausting explaining that I’ve tried them or can’t try them for X reason, or they laugh initially about my quirky sleep habits ( :/ ) but then eventually get mad when it gets in the way of something they want. It’s important to have at least one person who sees it as an unfortunate and unavoidable clash between social norms and someone’s perfectly natural bodily functioning, and not just a person who needs conversion to the “right” mode of being.

asktransgender,fazcg6q,t3_eaufq5,1576414733.0,"dark\_side\_of\_pluto has a really good categorization and I agree. I also feel it's sad how loaded the topic can get. Because I know people who have detransitioned who have said they felt entirely unsupported by trans friends (whether or or not the person was trans) and that it felt like they were getting the message they were doing something wrong by doing what's best for their body. And that's so sad, to probably have a trauma or body dysmorphia background so bad you'd want to transition, accidentally give yourself dysphoria, and then have to worry about people thinking bad things about you on top of that. Even if they find out they're cis, we have stuff in common and they deserve support.

*And*, I understand other trans people being on edge about it as well. Cis people have been freaking out about detransitioners since before that was a real thing. So, so, so many people told me that I'd regret HRT and surgery and detransition when they found out I was trans, and they didn't even have media representation of this stuff back in 2006. It's like there was a vacuum just *waiting* for a news story about an epidemic of detransitioners for the last decade. So, while I totally believe there's more detransitioning now than back when the gatekeeping was harsher, I'm actually very suspicious about how big this phenomenon is as opposed to regular old trans people and how much it's being overrepresented. Very suspicious.

Also, a lot of detransitioners run to TERFs precisely because the trans people who could be helping them drop the ball and they don't want to talk to most cis people. The TERF communities they end up in are actually nice to them. Even if that was all that mattered, though, they hurt detransitioners in the long run by helping to polarize things so much (so trans people are more suspicious, and detrans people feel more rejected) and by not believing in physical transition of any kind (because some people might not want to be on HRT or get typical top or bottom surgery, say, but would be much happier with some other, more subtle kind of body change)."

Antipsychiatry,f9jg1kv,t3_e5dtm3,1575372635.0,This slant makes me so upset. Of course people are killing themselves; we're living with untreated pain that is ruining our lives and many of us are getting taken off our medication.
CPTSD,f9j7wft,t1_f9hk0ot,1575360159.0,Thank you for that. I'm so sorry about what happened to you--I've met several people who were abused by people they were caretaking and it seemed very hard for them to get much understanding and empathy from others.

This makes sense. the only way I could cope at some point was shutting off my feelings."
CPTSD,f9h8rql,t1_f9h59f8,1575311002.0,">And then not feeling like I can say anything because I don’t want to contribute to the prejudice against poly people..

Yeah this is hard. Luckily my closest friends (one poly by orientation, one monog) both understand that I'm just upset about the situations that I've been in personally and I have faith that they won't walk away from it feeling bad about themselves or anyone else.

>I feel like my self worth and esteem, which I did already struggle with due to childhood trauma, was decimated.. and then I was made to feel bad for not being strong enough to handle it and for being affected by it all...

I'm so sorry :(  This is very relatable. I literally had a mild psychotic break after the lying and the ultimatum in most recent. Six months of complete agony and nonfunctioning. I think these periods have been the most painful in my life since early childhood. The relationship before that, a year or so went by after opening it up and he intentionally broke rules we set up and then left clues so I would find out about it and be devastated. Then told me he rubbed it in my face because he was sick of how many needs I had and how I didn't do enough work on myself (because I was still sad and jealous about having to be poly). I broke down completely under stress then too.

>I don’t know how to deal with it. Personally, I’m broken

Well, I really hope we can both figure it out and you can find more people who understand."
CPTSD,f9h72zc,t1_f9gxd8j,1575310178.0,"Yeah, same; literally. If it's not too painful, may I ask if you were given an ultimatum, or if you just tried it thinking it would help solve some relationship problem, or something else?"
CPTSD,f9h6wrx,t1_f9h18pp,1575310092.0,"Thanks very much for reading that, and for being so kind. I'm glad your relationships are healthy in that way. I don't think it's necessarily the toxic community aspect because I'm far too isolated from anyone except my partners usually--though I have seen glimmers of that with friends who have also been in iffy situations. I've also seen and heard of really supportive poly communities, or just groups of friends.

It's more like:

* I feel like I would be a morally better person if I wasn't jealous
* I have some really extreme trauma from childhood that gets brought up with this
* I usually don't feel like I can leave because my partners are in support or medical advocate or caretaker roles because I'm disabled and very poor and estranged from my family (and in one case I was basically stuck in the relationship and town under threat of more violence)
* I have horrible self-esteem from being disabled and trans and don't really feel like I'm worth much or satisfactory for anyone anyway

I'm not usually gaslit. Usually I'm just presented with a situation (most recently after being lied to for six months and only discovering by accident) and the person's like ""take it or leave it,"" but the ""leave it"" is really severe because of the power dynamics.

...right now my focus is primarily on getting myself more agency by any means necessary. Like more money and self-confidence and better health so nobody can make me feel trapped (or literally trap me) ever again. I want to be able to turn down an ultimatum like that without worrying if I'll be able to get help when I'm sick or be completely alone in the world.

I just feel torn to shreds by having felt like I had to agree to this stuff, and because I honestly don't even understand why it's such a big deal to me, like why I care. I've had to do all kinds of stuff I didn't want to do in relationships just so I knew I had support, and it's always been this horrid mush of feeling despicable and helpless, but this is by far the worst because it comes with the jealousy and triggering.

sorry if this doesn't make any sense or is rambly. i think i'm on the verge of a meltdown of some sort"
asktransgender,f92hv65,t3_e3diqx,1575031812.0,"I do think it's possible for some people to repress forever and simply live uncomfortable, sort of limited lives but not kill themselves. Not everyone. I would certainly not have lasted if I had to repress forever.

And there's people who are still miserable post-transition, because having dysphoria and being unhappy with your life are two totally different things. You could reduce your dysphoria significantly but still be unhappy about not living up to attractiveness standards for a man. Someone could transition and pass perfectly and 100% get the body they need and then their family and friends and partner completely reject them and they die by suicide.

And then yeah, you could ""partially"" transition (partial according to your own needs) and ease your dysphoria enough to get into the ""less happy in life than I coud be but still living it"" group and get back to physically transitioning later, if you so choose.

So short answer, no.

I really think most things in life are going to be more tolerable without dysphoria going on at the same time though. Like I'd much rather have financial problems without what feels like weird tumors on my chest than with. just me doh"
mypartneristrans,f92hbxw,t3_e39icp,1575031144.0,"It's hard to be around someone you love when they're miserable and speak badly about themselves, especially if you don't know how to fix it. As someone who absolutely shit-talks himself (the ""can't feel it anyway"" could be a quote) I know this, and I try to limit it, because even if it makes me feel better, even if what I'm saying is true, there's probably something else I could do to burn off those feelings that doesn't stress people out (it still slips out, though).

This doesn't mean your boyfriend is a bad person. However, it makes perfect sense that you would be sad, and it's probably better for you to just feel your feelings, that your loved one is unhappy and you feel helpless, than feel all that plus shame and self-recrimination. It's a heavy situation and you are allowed to have feelings. It's okay."

lupus,ettehis,t3_ccmmav,1563175756.0,"stuff that worked for me:

\-Amlodipine is my major Raynaud's med. I take the lowest dose possible and it cleared it up significantly. Used to be like knives in my fingers.

\-Cheap leather gloves with cashmere lining (and touchscreen capability) are a favorite for me as well.

\-Mittens work better though tbch. Back when my hands worked better, I knitted some fingerless gloves->mittens convertibles (that button back) and they were great.

\-Wearing a hat. Most of your heat is lost through your head, so if you can prevent the vascular reflex that causes Raynaud's from happening by keeping your head covered, you can avoid a lot of episodes.

\-I also have some electric heated gloves as well, with a battery pack, but they heat unevenly, and believe it or not they don't work any better than the knit or leather+cashmere. Less cute, too."
