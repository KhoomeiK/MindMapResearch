I’m just scared I won’t be good enough, I won’t make money, I’ll never find a partner, that type of stuff. I also don’t know what I want my future career to be or what colleges I’m going to apply for. I’m scared of the unknown, failure, and disappointment to myself and others. Also taxes and bills, oh boy."
