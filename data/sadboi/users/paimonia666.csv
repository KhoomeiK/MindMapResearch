My vision doubles sometimes, just like when you cross your eyes and its hard for me to get back to normal seeing sometimes. But I found out that my eyes are not crossed when that happens, I managed to ask my bf one time when it happened if my eyes are crossed in that moment and he said I don't cross them.

The only thing Im thinking about is getting a top surgery, but another side reason for that is, that I also have a genetic risk for breast cancer so it would not only be for transitioning purposes."
BPD,fdlm2sw,t1_fdllc96,1578527099.0,"I know the feeling of not knowing who I am, I guess a lot of Borderliner can relate to that. That's also why I started to identify with borderfluid, it helped me get a name for my feeling and identity and brought order. I cut my hair so it's easier for me to switch between masculin and feminin and so when I feel any kind of dysphoric I switch my outfit and put on or wipe off makeup, style my hair different and it really helped me. Maybe my experience helps you in some way.

Here is the definition of borderfluid by the way:
""A fluctuating gender experienced exclusively by people with BPD [borderline Personality Disorder]. A gender identity lacking a firm grasp on ones identity, while still experiencing gender, to varying degrees, but having trouble pinning it down to just one label or identity. Having the sense of grasping at labels as much as possible to describe a gender we keep questioning because we keep second guessing our sense of selves and, consequentially, our sense of gender.
Can be combined with relevant genders."""
BPD,fdli9lc,t1_fdkw8cj,1578524606.0,"I personally have seen a lot trans and nonbinary people with BPD that felt a lot better after transitioning/coming out nonbinary, myself included. If you sometimes feel confident in your own gender and sometimes you have diaphoria that most likely makes you genderfluid (borderfluid), not trans, so there is mostly not really a big transitioning. If you are dysphoric all the time you are most likely trans, BPD or not. I have never seen any trans person with BPD regretting it. Of course you should start therapy and see how it goes before doing any big steps but that's what you also would do if you don't have BPD."

BPD,fdkhjnu,t1_fdkfo2f,1578504010.0,"Why should it be any less genuine if it's caused by BPD? If you are genderfluid/borderfluid, trans or any kind of nonbinary, even if it's caused by your BPD, that's still who you are. Also who cares if it's caused by BPD or not, you will never know, so why questioning that when it doesn't even really matter. Your genderidentity isn't any less valid when it's a cause of BPD then it is when you don't have a mental illness. What's most important is that you feel good in your skin no matter what you need to do and how you need to change your body to achieve that."

I grew up with campaigns in my country called ""I don't want to be a offender"" that was against the stigmatization of this disorder.
