If we would have gotten him in as a wide receiver more, and ran end arounds or quick screens, he could have done something but he was never able to get into open space, I think that was the turning point for me on Haley.

He was the first defensive draftpick when we started expecting them to play early. I don't think Sequez was a ""miss or a bust"", because you can't predict injuries like that. I would say Mike Adams was a pretty bad miss, but it didn't hurt us as much as he got hurt in a back alley parkinglot.
