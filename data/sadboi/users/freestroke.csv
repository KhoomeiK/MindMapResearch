leaves,fb2izb4,t1_f9p3mc5,1576451920.0,Thanks.  I like that idea of shaking up my routine.  That makes a lot of sense.
leaves,fb2ipda,t1_f9oy41f,1576451774.0,Thanks.  Unfortunately I’ve tried that in the past and would end up just buying all of the stuff all over again.
leaves,fb2ikev,t1_f9oye2s,1576451700.0,Thank you.  You’re right about everything you said.  I may take you up in that private message thing.

leaves,f0zjn1g,t3_d78zo2,1569096958.0,Try to read as much as you can about the damage it can do to someone your age.   I did that and scared myself straight.
bipolar,f0nod4t,t3_d5lvhp,1568775550.0,I’m not crying.  You’re crying.
BipolarReddit,eyv3fj4,t3_cyvpbn,1567479509.0,"I have bipolar I and I’m an attorney and have been practicing law for 17 years.  I have to be especially mindful to watch my stress levels so they don’t trigger anything, but I can still practice law and you will too as long as you manage the disorder properly.  

Hang in there.  A diagnosis of bipolar I is scary but it’s not a death sentence.  It can be managed and when it is you can live a decent life.  You just need to be careful to avoid any triggers (I know, easier said than done) and do the stuff everyone tells you to do (exercise, healthy diet, avoid isolating yourself, etc).

If you want to DM me any questions feel free."
bipolar,ey1dtt7,t3_cuy4xx,1566696991.0,"I’m in a similar boat.  I’m an attorney at an investment bank.  I had to take a 12 week absence after everyone in the office watched me have a full blown manic episode.  I’m pretty convinced they didn’t fire me only because they were afraid I’d sue since my actions were related to a medical condition.  I too feel like an imposter.  I’ve made the decision not to try to climb any higher up the corporate ladder.  I’m about at my maximum amount of job stress I figure.  Any more and I’m afraid it could trigger either a manic or panic attack.  Unfortunately that’s meant watching all my college and law school classmates exceed much more than me.  Also, like you, I’m definitely grateful for everything I have now, but my job is pretty much the only thing I didn’t lose as a result of my manic episode.  Friends, family, etc., I lost most of them.  Not to mention all of my retirement savings and college savings for my kids.  I came really close to bankruptcy, and even with a good job, I wrecked my credit so bad my dad (when I was 40 years old) had to co-sign my lease.  I feel like such a failure, even though I know I’m lucky to have a good job."

bipolar,esuis2u,t3_c8x6wa,1562284126.0,I had even more debt at my worse but that was 10 years ago and it’s all paid off.  But I remember what a great feeling it was to start to be able to bring the amount down.
bipolar,esialze,t1_eshap8v,1562010005.0,"They all didn’t all come doctors, including the one you highlight, but I didn’t make any of them up.  I was trying to make a list of everything I could remember reading or people telling me what I should do or not do."
bipolar,esg7mig,t1_esg0dda,1561945304.0,The exact same thing happened to me.  In fact my new pdoc thinks the antidepressants I was taking made the mania worse.  Such a great disease.
bipolar,esg7c52,t3_c7klfk,1561945077.0,"OP here.  So to address all the negative comments, I’m not saying at all that these things aren’t good to do.  I was just trying to make a little light of the fact that you read in so many places bipolar disorder is a manageable disease, but then when you start digging into what people tell you to do to manage it, it can become a little overwhelming.  I intended this to be lighthearted and I wasn’t trying to say any of these weren’t important things to do.  Very sorry for upsetting people."
