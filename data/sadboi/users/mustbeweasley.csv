Teachers,fkuldot,t1_fkuktyu,1584551549.0,"My university has a new teacher pinning ceremony to welcome us into the profession. When they cancelled that I straight up cried. Missing out on all the traditions of graduation is awful, and I have already received my cap, gown, and invitations. ðŸ˜­

I'd say buy your cap and gown for pictures if nothing else. You've worked hard for this degree!"
Teachers,fkuk26w,t3_fkrpfo,1584550855.0,"Yep. I'm in the same boat. We keep getting emails telling us not to panic, but they never give any solid info. 

I'm a mom, 30, and I have been working towards this for 7 years... I am devastated."

AmItheAsshole,ezeisz5,t1_ezeh2f9,1567864481.0,You act like this is a cut and dry situation. It isn't. He is in bad faith for continuing to have unprotected sex when everyone knows that hormonal birth control isn't foolproof.
AmItheAsshole,ezei5tr,t3_d0v6ir,1567864231.0,"YTA- I understand that you didn't want children, but you should have been more proactive in that pursuit and gotten a vasectomy. 
Saying that she would get an abortion is all dandy in theory, but being faced with the reality is a whole other beast. You shouldn't continue to push abortion when you have absolutely no idea what she is going through. 
As for adoption, I am also adopted and had a semi-open adoption. It was the best thing that could have possibly happened for me. There are so many families that desperately want children but can't have them, and your baby could help one of those families."
AmItheAsshole,ezegism,t1_ezeepvk,1567863589.0,He assisted in this pregnancy! Wouldn't that fall under breaching trust and changing the plan??

Fantasy,etpf078,t3_ccpna2,1563053667.0,"They don't have any imagination left. I think reading and understanding fantasy and fiction requires quite a bit of higher thinking ability. You also have to he able to apply willing suspension of disbelief, which some people just can't do."
fo76,etlo1or,t3_cc9g4d,1562941402.0,I love this idea. There are so many camps that I visit that I am just awed by. Maybe I'll have to do the token thing in the meantime.
