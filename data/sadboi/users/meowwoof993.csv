MensRights,fql0auz,t3_ghpfi5,1589441868.0,It is unfortunate that the core values of feminism have been changed or ignored with the new feminist movement. I’m not saying that a man’s voice is invalid. Of course we should listen to both. But if you ignore the fact that we still live in a patriarchy then you are highly ignorant. Women DO need MORE help than men if we are to ever be equal. And that’s a simple fact. That doesn’t mean that men shouldn’t attain the assistance they require and the protection they require as well. We are all humans we all have rights. I’m just saying women need more help given the thousands of years where we have not been able to fight for our freedoms rights and safety.

MensRights,fqgq29w,t3_ghpfi5,1589353439.0,"Although I understand some of your argument. I disagree with parts of it. To begin, yes feminism is about equality if the sexes in all aspects. But you have to understand and recognise that we do still live in a patriarchal society. When you go to school, if you seek approval and need a form signed they will ask for your father’s signature. 

Although millennial women have done an exceeding job into taking up traditionally male dominated jobs such as in corporate, it is not enough to pat oneself on the back. 

Also, yes all girls should go to school. And it “shouldn’t be easier for girls” is a very poorly thought out argument. If you want all girls in rural India to get into school, you do need to prop them up, support them, put them on a pedestal more so then you would for a boy. This is because women and girls have been inferior in our history. 

Look at sati and female infanticide. So the argument that women should be equal without being given the tools to reach that level of equality amongst men in society is invalid in a society and environment build by men for men."

The character depth, the relevancy of the topics, the vocabulary and vernacular used reflects that of modern society in Korea. Also, the character development is done so beautifully. The chemistry between Donghee and Joohyun is sensational. Really would recommend to anyone who enjoys dark humour and thrillers."

Advice,fmwgx8q,t3_fxqf27,1586446380.0,"1. Yes, you worked hard (I’m assuming) in school. But honestly who TF cares about grad and prom?? You’re graduation has little to no value in your future job, friendships, networks. Nothing. 

2. Take a student loan to help pay for college. If you don’t want to take a loan because of the debt, research the many many scholarships available in your country. There are so many, trust me!

My advice, be a problem solver. It’s easy to whine, be the person who comes out of this stronger and people can look at and commend."
SuicideWatch,fmwfiy3,t3_fxjwd8,1586445663.0,"I know how you feel. Been diagnosed clinically depressed as a teen. 

It’s really comforting sometimes to think these thoughts as you have OP. But it’s dangerous.

I know it’s peaceful. Almost this sense of nothingness. No time, no feeling, no people. It’s easy. 

But you should try to get your mind out of that dark lonely place. If that’s therapy, medication, confiding in family/friends, you should seek it. 

Because sleep will always be there. But the world and everything that it holds for you, will pass you by. 

I hope you’re doing alright"

He was talking to us about the economic downturn we are all going through right now. He said that as an entrepreneur you need to be smart and that in this day and age, fixed costs don't exist because you are constantly renegotiating deals, such as your rent, electricity and wage.

I'm still confused as to what he was getting at."

socialskills,fijrq3w,t3_f87m4j,1582461592.0,Medication is one way to approach mental health. It’s a personal decision you should make. But more importantly therapy is a good way to help deal with it. Learn to develop the tools that can pull you out of that state of mind rather than solely relying on medication.
socialskills,fifjbdt,t3_f7qlc9,1582390320.0,"I feel bad that you had to go through this. But you’re still young and kids are immature. You shouldn’t be scared to make new friends. I know the first step is daunting and seems almost impossible to pass. But when you just say hi and make small talk, like your name, classes you’re in, common interests, you’ll find it easier. Don’t think you’re parents will judge you. And even if they suggest going to therapy, think of it as getting advice from a trained specialist, so you know it’s not bs. But anyways, it’s okay, now you’ve at least experienced something of this sort at a younger age and can deal with it. Try approaching people, join clubs, it’s easier to make friends, and just say hi. Not everyone is a dick head. 

Good luck!"

Anyways I live in India and money is a super touchy subject that makes or breaks your character. I see people paying others back. But I don’t know if it’ll run her the wrong way since I’m much younger and an intern. Should I just pay her back? I’m interning for two months and this company seems to have a gossiping culture so I don’t want to tarnish my reputation. Although I guess it doesn’t matter because it’ll only be for two months. But the CEO is friends with a family friend of mine. I’m going off on a tangent here. 

Money is a super taboo topic and I don’t want to seem cheap, when in actuality I can just pay her back? Or should I not? 

I hate confrontation."

AmItheAsshole,ffbr2ql,t3_esjhx2,1579779364.0,"YTA. Instead of worrying about the small things like a photo, maybe you should try working out why you feel this way about your foster sister. You clearly don't know enough about her to form such harsh opinions, and that too about a photo. Try spending time with her and get to know her and don't be this selfish. Just having a mother and an assured roof over your head is a privilege. Imagine what that ""14 or 15ish"" year old girl is feeling like... Your mother would really be disappointed if you made such a big deal over a girl she is caring for."
