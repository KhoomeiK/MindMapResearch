That generation also wasn't shy about hitting us kids. No fists, but I had wooden spoons and sticks broken on me, and was slapped twice. They were actually pretty normal for that time.

Thankfully 'normal' changes, and I am extremely loving to my boy. He gets lots of hugs and encouragement, and he is growing up knowing he is loved. And I have never and will never hit this kid. 

As a side note, my dad has changed a lot over the years, largely due to becoming a grandfather. I think they were an opportunity for redemption. He was a dickhead to my older brother (who he'd adopted - the product of my mother's first marriage, and when my brother died, the regret was written all over him.

Right now the strategy is either.
Wait until they are caught and prosecute.
Bait them online and throw them in jail before they can offend. 

If the numbers are as problematic and alarming as I suspect they are we need to be having a different conversation. Firstly, how about offering treatment so these people don’t offend in the first place??  If it’s so common then how does it serve the community and, more importantly the kids, to make the conversation so taboo? We have programs to stem gang violence, educational programs, preventative strategies.
