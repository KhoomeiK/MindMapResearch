Thetruthishere,fisdbq2,t3_f9jff5,1582682659.0,"I think about this a lot. 

It’s happened to all of us, I’m sure, where we say something in (direct, verbal) conversation and the next day we see an add regarding it on Facebook. We know that our phones are constantly listening and adding our words to their ad algorithms- I read a post one time where a guy and his wife decided to test it out by intermittently talking about cat food (didn’t own any cats), and within a few days they were both getting ads for it. 

But more than once I have seen people who claim to have only thought about something, only to see it become an ad on some site they’re using (usually Facebook or google). This makes me think. 

There is evidence that [small movements in the larynx accompany internal thought and subvocalization](https://curiosity.com/topics/what-is-the-little-voice-in-your-head-curiosity/), and I remember reading something a long time ago about the potential technology has to take advantage of this trait we share by using x-rays (or some other observation technique) to function. For example, a coffee machine that turned on when you simply thought the words, “make me coffee.” Horrific. 

I don’t know how widespread this practice is, but googling “subvocalization observing technology” results in some pretty sci-fi stuff. I wouldn’t put it past Apple, Android, or especially Google to be using this tech in our phones. 

Not sure. But I hope to god I’m not on my own show."

About the only race I’m really good at identifying is Native American, because I have a lot of Native Americans in my family and the traits they share (cheekbones, nose structure) are very noticeable to me. Even then, there are some races that look Native American to me.
