samsung,flwja0o,t1_flwihto,1585552729.0,Yeah so I would assume the A51 wouldn't have the same issue as it is using the standard Super AMOLED display rather than the Plus.
samsung,fl3ckzs,t1_fl3aq6x,1584777649.0,"Literally same situation as me, I use blue light filter a lot, had it really bad on the first device I received, got a replacement which still has the same problem but isn't as bad so have decided to live with it.

I think it has something to do with the Super Amoled Plus technology. The Plus part in particular as I have learned they have only used the Plus version of this display in the A71 and the last time was on the Galaxy S2 released in 2011. I looked online and found a lot of Galaxy S2 users had the same problem, which would indicate it has something to do with this specific display technology they are using."
