But again I have to stress that the word king may be perceived as “absolute ruler over others” however it is not my personal interpretation because I view that definition in the same line as “Tyrant” 

No he’s not a messianic figure or ruler of any aspect but he is remarkable and a noble figure which is why he’s deserving of such a title."

DMT,fk0dtgq,t1_fjznvpc,1583753580.0,"My brother is close to your size ( 6’2”~270) and had the same issue. Low and slow 410• vaporized did the trick for him. Find a dry herb vaporizer and sandwich it with dried parsley which will help with the harsh taste because you’re going to need to draw in more breaths. 

Try going 70mg, If you don’t break through the first time but feel the effects that’s good, keep going for about 10 min.

After coming down within 15 min you can load up another 50-70mg. And you WILL blast off by the second breath. Keep discovering what method works right for you but avoiding THC and alcohol day off and before helps significantly.

Best of luck"

Jung,fk0abey,t3_fei8ro,1583749482.0,"Beautiful illustration, what emotions did this invoke?

Eerily enough I’ve had counterpart visions to your image where the cube is blue and oscillates between warm radiant light and ineffable energy.

The energy makes where you colored the black mountains as green pyramids and there were people/figures kneeling as if giving reverence (your image looks like an exaltation) 

Don’t recall a horned figure, but the choir of ethereal sound. Colors and the feeling of belonging to the space I was envisioning."
