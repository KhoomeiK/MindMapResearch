Mandarin has somewhat connected its usage with the politcal ideology that is China. Since China is a communist state, the language can be associated with that of ‚Äòauthority‚Äô instead of ‚Äòfreedom‚Äô, if you will

So unless authority becomes important to the majority of the world, I dont think many people will want to learn Mandarin, like the way many people want to learn English."

Physical intimacy just seems like a luxury at this point. You‚Äôll either have a lot of it, some of it, or nothing at all. And its not something you can buy or earn either. 

There are a lot of great guys out there that deserve to find someone. They are nice, have goals, have confidence, money, etc. but they will never see the light of day with women...of course this is only one of the many unfair experiences that this life offers."

I think the less we worry about these labels to see if we fit in that ‚Äòbox‚Äô, the easier it will be to meet new people and make friends.

Really ask yourself...why do I want to only hang out with people my age? what will you gain from them that you wouldn‚Äôt an older person?
