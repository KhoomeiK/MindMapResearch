You can set the first layer (group) as the background And the last layer (group) as the foreground to get some cool effects. 
You can adjust the timing in the settings to get it on ones, twos, or whatever you need up to 60 FPS. I’ve found that 1920 x 1080 gives you 250 layers to work with and that’s enough to stitch scenes together in LumaFusion which lets you do voice overs right in the app so you can do Japanese/Korean style mouthing action—where it’s not entirely synced.

They probably have it of course, but I wanted to help and it passed a few hours one afternoon.   


I designed a battery that will give a Tesla Roadster battery equivalent 200,000+ km range using just two chemicals and is based on a 5th dimensional geometrical shape (It’s still feasible to build as long as the bond order is done properly and the “crystals (I suppose that’s what I would call them—though I haven’t latticed them so perhaps just molecules at this point)” are aligned correctly.   


Last night I designed a ventilator that was extremely annoyingly phallic, but repelled dust from the entry way completely using it’s natural negative charge and uses aerogel in series to clean and clear the air intake before being pumped and after being pumped in series to multiple people. Since you can make the stuff at home in a mason jar over a two day period I figured why not use it as a contaminant containment material since it’ll swell noticeably and you can remove it or clean it subsonically to reuse it. Sent that to the Welsh Folks who designed their own ventilator in three days. If it helps who needs the recognition.   


Now I’m a bit bored to be honest. I’ve also being taking art classes and writing my next book and doing podcasts for my series at [Divergent Mind](https://Anchor.fm/DivergentMind) where I talk about my inventions and read children’s books to my family in other countries.

chemistry,fli6853,t1_flgzkuq,1585176115.0,"Sorry for the lousy load time, I should have just put it on youtube. 

Okay, let me see if I have the parts in order: 

It’s minimizing the collection of atoms that I’ve put together into a chemical framework near ideal. By doing that it’s trying to get the proper bond length/atom position that gives an Energy readout within a boundary of if there’s an x-y graph, and delta is on the x axis and there are two points plus/minus delta (though I don’t know the unit—so assuming kJ/mol?) then it should assure that there is that Energy output within the y axis between two points plus/minus Epsilon (same unit). Uses a Universal Force Field (UFF). That’s my understanding for that. 

If that’s true and that energy level is possible with those materials (can it be an electrical potential like lithium ion since you can use trace Pd or stable Pd depending on what’s available?), if possible to be built reasonable or for specialty uses, then is it useful as an energy source, or does that mean that it’s just explosive chemically and unsafe. 

My software is limited as is my income as I’m on disability so I’ve only been able to find one software that I can afford, and these are the functions that it offers—within the reasonability of my hardware, which is years old at this point. 

Did that help at all? I’m trying to research battery alternatives using long lasting element types that are stable if possible. Bill Gates is looking for a stage IV reactor, and so I’m just working towards that getting to the worlds needs one step at a time until I get the (or a range) of potential solutions.

When it’s someone I can help with I find myself answering more often, and in depth. But there are worse subreddits to go to. I find the bipolar one sort of toxic for instance for what I stated above (Which is just my opinion and why I unsubbed, but it could have been the time of year or my own perspective for all I know).   


What I do, is come here every day and try to bring something when I can that might cheer you folks up. It’s usually something I’ve made since I don’t do much else. Busy hands, clear head sort of thinking. It works for me.   


If you’re finding yourself in need of something to do and are broke but have a terminal To use thats yours or a google account you can save docs at a library to or phone or whatever Here’s what I’ve done so far during the onset of the illness and up to now when I would call it ”managable” (haha+\_+).  


Writing books/memoirs. Scientific papers. Try to invent something new. Paint. Draw. Digital or otherwise. Create a podcast on [anchor.fm](https://anchor.fm) with just your phones microphone reading what you wrote. I use gear that I saved up months for that cost about $150 dollars for a one person kit but can be done for much cheaper. Being productive makes people happy according my therapists. Releases dopamine, and if you‘re taking your meds it might just be the right amount to enjoy things just a wee bit more. Between the bad times.   


But there are also times when you just are unable to help someone else. Like when they’re clearly psychotic or delusional and all you can say is trust that so and so person or doctor and take your meds, and rest, and just wait it out—it passes and gets better. Even if it’s slow. It took me about 5 years to come out of my first psychotic break. Now I’m stuck with constant paranoia. But I got lucky. Medicated early, and I think since then I’ve missed two doses by mistake or being manic.

I was doing some basic research last night and everything from the Tsar Bomba is still active in the atmosphere as well as other bombs, and their fallout. Even if it’s just a mol of the material the Beta- decay as the larger materials like Cesium which still take decades decayed into the strontium which itself has Beta- decay To yttrium-90 would be causing damage to the surrounding area, as they have a field of decay of roughly 6 feet. It might explain the cancers and mutations everywhere.  But just as a for instance it’s roughly 2lbs fallout/per 20 kilotons explosive power. 

Here’s some related information that made me ask the question in the first place. [Maps of pollution, traffics I could get ahold of, and the like.](https://imgur.com/a/Lz7dY9C)

I know that there are six major types of sea water, and that radioactive material is attracted to positively charged materials, so would we have to gather plates and after altering them to survive the waters and attract the materials and their breakdown methods—would we make floating radioactive barges down deep enough (roughly 330 feet) to habitat fishable healthy food stuffs again?

It depends entirely on what your cast is about, how many hosts you have, I will say that microphones over phones do a better job and that if you're running garageband on iOS bluetooth headphones as monitoring headphones will lag which made me feel queasy.

Then spend the remaining half with messages from fans, sponsorships, and my shops as well as music I wrote for an exit so they're roughly half way.

Breathing is fine as far as I understand it at least for audiobooks like for what I do and can't be helped because of my condition.

At least that's how I got started for the first 50 episodes. Good luck!"

I have a fantasy book that might be up your alley. Magical talking animals sort of thing.

In the mean time I’ve been reaching out to places where I can get sponsored on my own. You may want to try amazon affiliate links on your website/youtube page linking to gear you use or recommend of want to get eventually. I’m still figuring that out but it seems reasonable.

What is the best way to build a youtube correlation to your podcast? I’ve been creating movies and posting them their as well organised by the books I’m reading. One’s kid friendly, one may not be and I’m clear about that at the onset. Others to follow will have the same audience explanations at the beginning of the books. I suck at tagging. Is there a tag research database for such a thing?  


Also how do you cross promote with other podcasters if you don‘t know where to look? I tried fantasy subreddits but got shut down because of whatever reasoning they had. I read books I’ve written for family and friends, but as far as I know the only person in my family that listens to any of it is honestly my mother lol. Which I can tell by statistics on Anchor. I’m still trying to figure out what “Other” is—does anyone know?"

Is it worth redoing the audio inserts in this (most of my episodes have the same ones because I’m 17 days in.) I know the one using anchors recording software is low so I should redo it, and probably the sponsored ad now that I can not um and uh so much.   


I frontload my content because I personally hate ads at the front and mid ranges of content, especially when reading a book to someone. Is it an entirely stupid idea or can I be happy getting less and enjoying sharing my work a bit more often? So everything from calls to actions to sponsorships and messages from fans are after the content, which I know means they’re skippable but I told them how to skip them with audio cues within the first few episodes anyway. I read to two demographics at the moment, adults about mental illness and Innovation first hand, and young adult fantasy novels I’ve made for my family’s children, while thinking of adding a third or fourth book in that I’ve written. I’m not sure if that’s going to overload the listener since the two I’m reading both have sequels written. 

Would you also look at my youtube channel for this and tell me what you think please. It’s been around for four days. It’s the same content as my podcast. I’m still learning how to work it but I think I have the basics down. It’s all being done from a last years model iPad Pro which I guess has been working well.

What niche do you want to cover? Do you want to record it to bolster your YouTube fanbase? Do you want to upload it to youtube as an audiobook series/podcast series? There’s a bit to think about.  


I’ve been doing this for two weeks, releasing 40 episodes so far. That seems to be a lot for a newbie as far as I’m told but not undoable if you’ve got 45 minutes to record and edit 20 minute episodes with ad drops, calls to action, messages from fans or loved ones, Precursors to the next episode. Stuff like that. You’re generally making an intimate, fun, or silly thing. You’ll need to pick something that accents your fan base.  


Do you want to pay for a hosting platform or host it on something free that can spread it out for you? I use [anchor.fm/DivergentMind](https://anchor.fm/DivergentMind) to give you an idea of what’s to be considered. It spreads it out to 10 different platforms including apple google and most other major players. I pay castos to turn episodes into videos and upload them for me with thumbnails I do myself at Taught Myself on youtube. It’s only two days old so my metrics are super low at 3,700 impressions and 50 views 12 viewers and no subs. If you have any tips on improving there, I’m glad to help you more here—and maybe we can cross post a helpful guide on what to do."
