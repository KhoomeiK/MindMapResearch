But here's the thing, your perspective is all fucky when you cut your own bangs. You're looking at your own hair from underneath at a weird angle. Unless you are lucky or experienced this usually results in bangs that are *at least* an inch shorter than you planned. So yeah, she probably thought she was being conservative and aimed for nice long bangs but ended up with microbangs. I've done this more than once. :/
