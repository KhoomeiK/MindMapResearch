GC beliefs tend to include:
1. “Trans” is just an othering term for gender nonconforming
2. Natal males tend to be significantly larger and more muscular than natal females, and therefore should not be permitted in women’s sports or safe spaces
3. Brain structure is not gendered
4. Clothes should not be gendered
5. Interests should not be gendered
6. Participation in preferred pronoun use should always be optional
7. Some men are predators and/or fetishists, so assume any man trying to colonize women’s spaces has bad intent

GC is not the same as anti-trans. Many GCs accept trans people as gender nonconforming, but simply don’t believe TMAM/TWAW.

Social conservatives are often anti-trans but not GC; they dislike gender nonconformity and wish to keep gender stereotypes intact."

Trans is a fundamentally sexist and othering philosophy that creates extra categories for gender nonconforming people.

Woman 1: In short, I’m a feminist!

Woman 2: Really, why haven’t you said anything about women’s issues?
