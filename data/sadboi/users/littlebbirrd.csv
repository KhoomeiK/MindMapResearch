Teal is a pretty word and a strong adjective, but it still confuses me; 

> “You smell Beast everywhere, Adii.” the half elf’s horizontal ears bent downwards as she let out a heavy sigh to look at her companion.  

I know who doesn't say that line, but whose ears are bending here? So far, I have no knowledge of who is half-elf and who's not, so using that as a dialogue tag, or in dialogue pause, is definitely not the right choice. Why not:

>“You smell Beast everywhere, Adii.” Adiiele sighed, and her horizontal ears bent downward as she stared at her companion.

And:

>Ignoring Roan's stare, Adii rolled her teal eyes to the sky, then returned to the looming figure of the mansion. 

Do you see? As an author, you know who you're talking about, but try to see through my eyes. How am I supposed to know who is who, when you're only using physical aspects as the subject. You should strive for more clarity in your writing, at least, in the beginning.

DestructiveReaders,f870a0f,t3_dz5j5s,1574311729.0,"**GENERAL REMARKS**

Ignoring the grammar mistakes, I think you get the tone right sometimes, but the beginning is completely wrong as well as the ending, and the whole miscarriage  feels forced and not very well depicted in the MC, doesn’t feel convincing how she reacts and how she doesn’t react; the motivations of the characters, it’s like you can’t choose between what will make a better story, and is desperate so you’ll use everything. About the tone, the horror aspect of your horror story takes a while to set in, and when it does, is very awkwardly developed, because of weak descriptions of setting as well as emotions, like, one of the MC’s reaction to the whole town disappearing is like a cold-ass matter-of-fact comment, ‘It looks like this town is deserted’ instead of something that emotionally intrigues both the characters and the readers. 

&#x200B;

>The air was warm as Dan and Molly Murphy

What happened to her was horrible, but this beginning does no good, and I’m not sure if you should use the miscarriage as a hook, it’s so strong, although it would have more of an impact if it was in the first lines, instead of the middle of paragraph, only because these first lines are very boring, and the prose is not the best, like the usage of ‘was’, and ‘feel’, the filtering(using verbs like ‘feel’, ‘saw’, ‘realized’ etc, to tell the readers instead of showing, and the ‘to be’ verb helps a lot to make this a weak beginning.

>The old Molly would

Right here, I’m not sure who is the narrator. Sure it could be the all-knowing third-person narrator and that would work fine, but I’m not sure if that’s the case here. It looks like Molly is, but later in the story, it changes, so I get confused and distracted. 

>This new Molly had a permanent frown line etched between her eyebrows. 

Is the new Molly angry? Frustrated? Very sad? I don’t think this is enough to show me how the new Molly actually feels. I would guess sad, but again, not enough to show, and since you tried with only that line so far, I guess I should know for sure, but I don’t.

>After it happened Molly lay in bed for two weeks recovering.They say that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

 I really don’t feel this. The usage of this cliche phrase in the middle of something so completely devastating throws me off. Besides, who would say that to a person who just lost their child? I don’t believe it. It’s something very shallow for Molly to be thinking about. I feel for the fact that she has been in bed for weeks, but it lacks depth here. I don’t think you’re conveying her sadness/anger very well, and relying on the miscarriage too much. 

>When she found out she was pregnant; she put her plans to enroll in law school on hold. Since the miscarriage, she had no interest in going back to school.

 This information seems out of place as well. It comes right after a big revelation and it’s a tell, instead of a show. You use the word miscarriage again, to compare two problems, miscarriage and missing school, and one is definitely not as emotionally powerful as the other. Miscarriage is such a powerful word that it shouldn’t be repeated so closely. You might not want to compare the two, but it still forces me to do it, and it feels unbalanced. You could show me in other ways, through dialogue maybe, or later. Not now.

>Dan had grown up in the small town of Marion in Upstate New York. 

Okay, so this is the first paragraph to give me some feeling of horror, the rest sets the tone for a really heavy drama, maybe you should look into that, or maybe not. It could be both, anyway. But Dan ‘concerned’ should be expanded, give more details of why he was so concerned about his friend, and maybe I will be concerned as well.

>Dan had decided to drive there from the East Village, where he and Molly lived with her parents. 

This paragraph is so convoluted with motivations that I am simply giving up on all of them. First, Dan is worried, second, Dan wants a story, which already weakens the first motivation and makes Dan seems like an asshole, because it feels like he really doesn't care about his friend and hopes that he will get a good story out of him, and I know that he could be only interested in the other stories of the other people disappearing, but since it is mingled with the fact that he is worried, it seems really suspect; third, he wants a road trip. 

>her eyes tilted up slightly at the corners, giving her an exotic look. 

So she looks a bit Asian? The adjective exotic might seem a bit racist, I’m just warning you.

>""I asked the guy behind the counter where to find a good restaurant and he said Darby's Celtic Pub was a good place to eat.""

Who is speaking? No pause in dialogue, that might seem unnatural. People often pause when speaking, and they almost always act in some way, move their hands, are in the middle of some action, looking this way or that.

>It is late afternoon when they get to Darby's. It is dim inside with dark wood paneling on the walls.

There’s a change from past to present tense here out of nowhere, very jarring change. Your description doesn’t give me much as well, but the choice of words goes in the right direction, like dark and dim, and even night. It sets a tone, but it lacks a more distinguished description that leaves a strong mark. 

>The bartender welcomes them.

From now on it seems that you really changed the tense form of the verbs, and you are sticking to it.  Cool. Hopefully, it won’t change again. I notice some grammar mistakes, and my grammar tool underlines it red and very clear to me, so I can’t ignore it. I wonder why you didn’t do the same and fixed it as easily.

>""Marion…. I have heard tha' name recently...oh! Is that the town where those people went missing? Why are you going there?""

Here, you’re still not using much dialogue tags, if any, and it’s fine since I can tell who’s speaking, the conversation is only between Dan and the waitress, but you should use it more, so it’s 100% sure readers won’t ger confused. And the conversation seems a bit convenient, don’t you think? And without any pause, very robotic, even when you try to put some variation the speech to, maybe, tell us that the waitress has an accent. 

>""I'm a journalist and I'm going to investigate for a story I'm writing. And my best buddy might be missing--he still lives there."" 

Hello, asshole Dan. I’m going to write a story about it, but my friend disappeared too, so there’s that. The only thing that bothers me is that it doesn’t appear to be intentional that he’s an asshole, but come on. How much does he really care about his friend?

>Dan orders the same thing. After Mae collects the menus and bustles away.

Okay, that’s really annoying now. I thought it was only Dan and the waitress who was talking, but apparently not. Do you have something against dialogue tags?

>""Maybe."" ""We could try again"" he offered, tensing up right after he said it, not knowing how she would react. ""Maybe."" 

This bit is nice. Both characters show a bit of raw emotions they must be feeling, all the while, Dan comments about the lack of children during that period. Makes me wonder why you let that information outright from the beginning, so the eerie feel of the lack of children in the school would be bothering me through their conversation. The tone is right, even if it still lacks a description of the surroundings, and it fits nicely with the conversation of children and raising family in contrast with missing people and danger which creates a climate of horror.

>""That's a little strange, even with the disappearances, strange for people to not want to be outdoors in broad daylight."" Molly said.

 I think it’s a mistake to link the disappearances to the fact that people are not in the streets in broad daylight, only because it’s far-fetched, and if she makes that connection already, then they too should feel afraid at this point, and not curious. This is where you have to be careful with not making your characters feel unreal, that mistake that so many horror movies make, where, from the cabin located in a faraway and isolated forest, people decide to take a look outside to check what made the weird noise in the middle of the night."

&#x200B;

No life. MC goes from dead and kind of troubled by it, to completely up to anything and puts decades of suffering past him. There are some inconsistencies in your world that I notice right away, that he doesn’t remember his name, but he remembers that he doesn’t like to bow, prideful. So is this important and a conscious choice you're making in building the character or you're just going with the flow of trying to make him cool because he doesn't bow down to no one? No matter what you're doing, it's not clear either way and it needs a bit more of work. 

Again, you try to convey some kind of discontent that MC felt while he was trapped in the black void/hell, but when he leaves he acts as if there's nothing worth remembering in his past, no nightmarish memory from his apparent long period of solitude. It's a very clear sign that he is a shallow character, and will continue to be for the rest of the story because nothing that happens to him will have a lasting consequence. He takes all that comes in his way very confidently (except for a few thoughts of 'damn, I'm screwed' that doesn't help at all), and that makes him very unnatural, it forces me to stop believing in your words. If he is supposed to be that unnatural, then try and make it clearer, because, for now, it just seems like a Gary Stu.

 The fiery Goddess of fire with fiery red lips is also a problem. Her boundaries are inexistent, and she is a tool for you to do as you please with the MC and has no depth, no goal, no interesting aspect, with very much to give to the MC, and very little to offer the story. There's a lot of importance given to her looks, and her need for help, but no explanation on her background, raising annoying questions, what kind of god? how does her power stretch? why can she control the MC but not her enemies? I know that these questions shouldn't all be answered, but some of them should, and the others should be hidden in a bunch of nice prose, good structure, and distracting dialogues. I didn't find these things, and so I must ask these questions. She can resurrect you, but can't deal with some enemies in a ship. And she can't resurrect other people, a whole army of people? If MC was so eager to accept her offer, what stops millions of other people from accepting as well?

**Dialogue**

They’re texting. Look at this:“””

>“Thank you, Sharlet, for not giving me an awful name.”  
>  
>“My you are awfully blunt now, aren’t you.”  
>  
>“Hey in my defense, you told me to stop with the formal stuff, so what did you expect”  
>  
>“Mmm, fair point,”

“””

This kind of dialogue is useless. Dialogue should work for the story, the setting, the characters, or it shouldn't be there at all. You could cut down almost all lines of dialogues, and the story would be better for it, which means that's exactly what needs to be done. And I'm not even going to go further about the flirting thing, it comes down to the whole Gary Stu who can even hit on a goddess who saved him from hell, it makes no sense at all.

To me, unless there's a pretty good reason, a goddess should be talking: 

&#x200B;

>“Thank you, Sharlet, for not giving me an awful name.”  
>  
>“I wasn't trying to please you, mortal.”  
>  
>“Hey in my defense... What?”  
>  
>“You accepted my deal. Now you're bound to me, and will obey."" 

Anyway, this is not telling you how your goddess should act, but I don't see a good reason why she shouldn't, and there should be a reason because being a goddess should not be the same as being a normal girl who talks like she's texting.

**Setting**

Black void, and white void. I think you get my point. No wonder you wandered from place to place in the blink of an eye, it's not fun to write about a character devoid of personality walking through a big nothing while having to convince the readers that he has suffered. We need more. Give us memorable places, especially ones who advance the world, hell should have places that are supposed to make you suffer, and a goddess should have a more entertaining room to sit on her throne rather than a white space.

**Final Remarks**

Lack of information is a big issue. You have too much info dump about how the story should move forward, but completely ignoring where the story is, and why things are happening, or just happened. Basically, just an idea still waiting to be developed and edited."

DestructiveReaders,f7zyb26,t3_dxuru3,1574117999.0,"**General Remarks**

This submission has many problems with structure, grammar, lack of a good hook, and prose. The MC is unnatural in his reactions, like a robot going from here to there, trying but failing to look like a human. Being resurrected, for example, carries no weight for the MC, his reactions shows that he is grateful, and he agrees to repay, but other than that, where is the emotional payoff of something so huge as coming back to life? By a goddess, no less, to whom the MC also has no reaction other than a certain flirtation and attraction, like it's just another woman. The same goes for her since a goddess should not be talking like nor agree to be treated as just a woman, right? Also, the problem not only lies with how he speaks or reacts, but how he thinks and his thoughts, in general, give off a superficiality that comes from the lack of depth, and consequently, the lack of connection to the reader. It raises so many questions that challenge your world and ruin the immersion, instead of questions that serve as hooks to our curiosity and forces us to keep reading; why specifically him? Why can't she destroy the enemies? If she can resurrect people, why just one, and a completely inexperienced guy at that; Here, there is nothing working for the characters in terms of personality, and it's pretty jarring because it's not even inconsistent since it's inexistent. About the structure, there are waves of short paragraphs, one after the other, separated by inner thoughts, which are annoying, and you should strive to vary on the length.

**Structure**

Paragraphs serve a purpose, even their size, or maybe, one of the most important is their size. I can tell so much about a whole piece where all the pages contain only small paragraphs that struggle to contain at least two lines. I know that not only is your paragraphs boring, but also your sentences, because if they're that small, the maximum your sentences could reach is also that size, and could only get smaller.

I've tried copying the paragraphs of your first pages and edited them to make bigger paragraphs, and it's like your work sighed in relief, and thanked me. It's pleasing to the eyes, refreshing. That doesn't solve the problems of prose and plot and character, but it gets better. One step at a time. The action is so packed and rushed, though, that maybe the answer to this is not closing your two-lines paragraphs together, but expanding a bit more in his reactions and descriptions, a bit more of information that will create connection, relation, to the reader. For example, it's not enough to just tell me he's been decades in the void, but expand a bit more of what happened to him, how he struggled to deal with the problems and the consequences that will never leave him. If you want me to believe in such a character that can be resurrected suddenly and still flirts with the goddess who did it, then you gotta tell me more about him, AND please, vary on your paragraphs while you do it.

Right now, just practice a lot with bigger paragraphs, write a single one, challenge yourself, then divide it as you please, as you see fit, in a way that brings joy to look at.

Short paragraphs are so good. They are best when they come right after a breathless paragraph, and it comes with a thud, or maybe a boom, and you can't help but stare at it and feel it. Leave off short paragraphs for things that the reader needs to remember the most. A big revelation, a particularly nice sentence that you love, and want to put it in the spotlight. An emotion that you want the reader to feel. A single word can be a paragraph.

It helps greatly when the first impression someone has of a work is organized, a compact story, complete, at least to me, it’s a big turn-on.

No, MC’s every single thought doesn’t need its own paragraph. It’s so irritating. Sometimes there are two in a row, two paragraphs to separate two thoughts that have nothing special about them, simply another problem with structuring.

**Hook**

The very first sentence works a bit well, it has its problems and sounds awkward, but has mystery and immediately calls for attention. However, a few sentences down the line, everything is ruined by the ridiculousness of the MC situation, the suddenness of changes, which shows how your other problems that I have talked about tie in with one another. This beginning is quite devoid of anything interesting and it is even disregarded by the story itself when he leaves ‘the void’, he acts with such neutrality towards his past that forces me to do the same. The hook should be what raises my curiosity, yours manages to do that, but then my curiosity jumps away like those harry potter chocolate frogs. It's jarring how there are many things that could work as a hook, but since they are all packed together and never developed, they just don't work. Ressurection, hell, goddess of fire... Maybe choose one, and expand a bit, then move on.

&#x200B;

**Prose**

Some things are very cliche, awkward and unnecessary. What’s the need of telling us that the Goddess of Fire has fiery red lips? To me, it is almost as redundant as saying 'reborn again'. It would be worthy to notice if she had icy blue lips, that would be a twist. But there doesn't need to be a twist in her description, the words 'fiery red'  is a very unoriginal way of describing things (icy blue as well), and simplicity wouldn't bother me if not for the usage of the figure of speech. If you are going for metaphors, similes, etc., try to be more original. 

I noticed some repetition of words, and it's important to be aware… When you do it so much, in paragraphs so close together, each instance screams at the reader louder and louder, until it becomes impossible to not stop and lose track of the reading. Just read it out loud, if it sounds weird, change it. 

>“The orange *light* radiating from the screen increased in size and brightness, until the *light* became a blazing red *fire*, that reached out to me.  
>  
>I didn’t resist the *fire*, and as the flames wrapped around my skin, the red *light* began to envelope my body and swallow my vision.”

\>>>

>“The *light* radiated from the screen, increased in size and brightness, until *it* blazed red *fire*, that reached out to me. I didn’t resist the flames. They wrapped around my skin, enveloped my body and swallowed my vision.”

There, they're still your words, but more compact and no repetition of fire and light. And you could go further, always push for a smaller result, or even, adding more things without repeating yourself, practice doing that before posting your work, it’s filled with mistakes which you could’ve fixed with a simple grammar tool online."

By starting your story with the main character sleeping\\waking up, you’re not helping yourself. But maybe, you already know that. However, it’s not something that would scare me away depending on the context. The thing that bothers me the most is when characters wake up and still have to go through the morning routine, “I woke up and then I took a shower and ate breakfast…” But your way of starting the story is still interesting, and what could change is not the fact that he is sleeping, but the prose, which appears to be still in need of some heavy work. Try your best to not leave any sort of awkwardness in your words, or little mistakes that could affect the flow of the feeling you want to provoke. Definitely, do not write a barely thought out idea, try to make it pretty, and put it here so the critiques can show you the right way, without much attention to editing and making it as clean as possible so the critiques are able to actually give you something that will push you to your limits. In the first paragraphs, there are mistakes that ruin the immersion, and that is, putting it simply, annoying. An annoyance that can and probably will reflect in things which might not matter at all if you had just polished the story correctly, like the fact that he is sleeping. 

Let’s take your first paragraph. I quickly notice that you are trying to be creative with the structure of these first lines, making a little poem, or breaking the rules because it’s reflective of the fact that the main character is sleeping, and his dreams are chaotic. But the last thing I’d want my readers to think when they read something I wrote is; ‘I think I know what he is trying to do with his writing’. The repetition of the beginning in the first lines, the usage of the same sentence structure, and the awkward imagery created by your choice of words are all working together to make it a bad beginning. 

In the line edits that someone made in the google docs, they mentioned three paragraphs that should be made into one, and I agree with them. But I have something beyond to add about how you should try and vary your sentences, and strive to make them a bit more different from one another.

>*“Steadily, he filled his lungs*, **his chest struggling to decompress as if crushed by the depths of an ocean**.”  
>  
>“*The air was dry and cold at first, and then hot and humid*, **vortexes of dust and smoke forming around him** as the lid of his casket folded open.”  
>  
>“*He covered them with his hands*, **his body creaking like an abandoned mansion**.”

You wrote these, one after the other, and I’m not sure if you did it on purpose. But they have almost the same length and structure. There’s nothing damnable about them, they’re good sentences and they do a pretty good job in conveying images to my mind. However, the sameness starts to get boring. Maybe, you could get away with just these, but if you’re doing unconsciously, try and catch yourself right now and start varying the sentences in your paragraphs as much as you can, it will make it so much more dynamic and engage the readers. 

Ex: 

>“Steadily, he filled his lungs, but his chest struggled to decompress as if crushed by the depths of an ocean. The air was dry and cold,  then hot and humid. Vortexes of dust and smoke formed around him, as the lid of his casket folded open, and even while his eyes remained closed, light dazzled them. He covered them with his hands, his bones creaking like an abandoned mansion.”

Hopefully, you feel the difference. If not, it’s still your words as you chose them, the only difference being the positioning, which can improve, and you should try and find your best way to do it. You definitely can do better than before. 

Adding something about filtering as well, they definitely should be swept away from your story most of the time, but eventually, they are also necessary, for example: **“It was at this point that Arthur noticed the bones scattered on the floor.”** It makes sense for both Arthur and the reader to realize the same thing at the same time. It’s more powerful if it’s used only in moments like this. But definitely not this: “He entered **what appeared to once function** as an office space.” It sounds like you’re not sure of your setting, and your insecurity goes into your character. **‘He entered what once was an office space.’** if he is wrong about that assumption, who cares? 

Anyway, I know this is not a full critique. But since I don’t see myself posting my work here anytime soon, I just want to give my opinion on some things. So congrats on your piece, it has loads of potential. Don’t give up! I hope it helps."
