By setting one lower, the other wont kick on at night when the door stays shut, the other will sustain the temp, but the dormant fridge will pitch in during the day when it would be on otherwise.

AskReddit,fqn76i7,t1_fqn19f4,1589489819.0,"(I knew I shouldn't have used rape as the example.) 

I will be the first to point out that No means No and just because you were raped doesn't mean that you were at fault no matter what you were doing. You say no, it means no, he/she persists, and that's rape. The fault is on the rapist. Not the victim. 

But to say that you don't have some influence over the environment you put yourself in is to overlook the control you do have over your life.

I'll use another example. If I walk down the street with a bag just dripping with money, it's coming out the pockets, just stuffed to the brim with cash... and someone steals my bag... People would say, ""Well, what were you doing walking through the street with a bag full of cash... of course you were going to get robbed... what did you expect.""

Before my inbox blows up (too late) allow me to clarify.

Sometimes the ""reason"" things happen is well outside our control. Sometimes the reason is, in hindsight, somewhat within your control. Both are opportunities to learn, grow, or self destruct."
AskReddit,fqmz1dc,t1_fqm434g,1589485909.0,"You are sick for a reason. A cell mutated and grew into an aggressive cancer. You couldn't have seen it coming, but how you handle it will define you for years to come.

You were a victim of a horrible rape. But you also dressed sexually provocative, went to a club known for hookups, had too many drinks and went home with someone you dont know who turned out to be a preditor while in a vulnerable state. You made some risky choices and landed on a negative outcome. How you handle this event will define you for years to come.

Sometimes the event is through consequence of a series of unrelated actions... we can learn to see those patterns and alter our reaction to them accordingly for both positive and negative growth. 

Other times the event is spontaneous, thus unavoidable, so we cant prevent it, but how we handle it gets compiled into our character and shapes our future selves.

But the reason is usually only clear in hindsight through retrospection.

The saying really should be ""everything happens for a reason that you may never know until after this is all over and by then things could swing both ways depending on how you handle this."""
