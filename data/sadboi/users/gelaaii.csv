TwoXChromosomes,fil2mz6,t3_f89dgb,1582492340.0,"Honestly the concept of “friend zoning” is made by men who can’t accept rejection and turn the blame on the other person. It’s soo stupid. I’ve had this happen to me, he told me he liked me but I said I’m not looking for that and we remained friends for a long time, then he admits that he still liked me and when I said that it can’t really ever happen he accused me of friend zoning him and leading him on. I was hurt because the friendship we had wasn’t real at all and he was just sticking by in hopes that we’ll get together. Asshole move."

IdentityV,f8j9pac,t3_e0xqkj,1574597610.0,"Certain characters are free on certain days ( dont know the specifics) but you should keep an eye out and try them. I think you’ll find your main once u get to play certain characters and choose who youre comfortable with. 

When i was starting out i was obsessed with perfumer. You can practice rescuing and kiting with her. 

Also another thing to keep in mind when choosing who you want to get is whether you prefer decoding , rescuing or kiting."
