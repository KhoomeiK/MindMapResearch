That's not the only thing, like around certain people I act differently, pretending to like or dislike certain things, to try and impress them (I guess). Then again the facade of different personalities at different points etc, is getting almost as easy as the fake smile, which is technically a facade in itself as your face is saying your ok, but on the inside you aren't ok.
