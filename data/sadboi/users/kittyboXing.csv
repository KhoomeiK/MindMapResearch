And honestly, I don’t want to rain on your parade EVER but... the Mexican situation is off putting to me. Red flags to narcissistic behavior is what I’m reading... he’s got you all caught up in his web of charm and lust that you may not be able to see what’s actually happening in front of you. This happened to me... both of us fell really quickly for each other and were obsessed and always together and on the phone for hours, and then over time... the real him started showing through and it wasn’t a good thing. 

Don’t get me wrong- no negativity coming from me, I’m just a little nervous about Mexican. I could be really totally wrong../ but just pay attention to how much attention he’s paying you. If he’s almost smothering, watch yourself..: it seems cute when you’re fresh “out” of a relationship because you’re like oh shit- he’s so affectionate and he calls me 10 times a day! Yeah..: wait until everything gets flipped over and he’s acting the opposite toward you, after he’s already hooked you, then it gets to the point where it’s easier just to stay with him because you’re scared to leave. 

Eyes open chicka! Good luck <3"

I didn’t realize how strong of a person I am until I stopped meds after 13 years... even though i did not want to do a damn thing and didn’t care about much, anxiety almost paralyzing me constantly, I had to force myself to be better and think better and feel better and eat better.
