And I’m sorry maybe you’re right in your own way, everyone’s allowed to have their own opinions, but I wouldn’t get rid of any of my pets, under any circumstances. I feel like when you decide to take in a pet, it’s family. Not something you can just get rid of. 

Also, I think in most cases, a problem with an animal can be fixed. With the cat being bipolar, I don’t know you, so I’m not saying you tried everything, but most people don’t. They don’t try tiring the cat out daily, or CBD or things like that before just getting rid of their pets. And I think usually the close bond a pet forms with whoever has adopted them, and then just getting rid of them is really what irks me. Like I said, surprise circumstances not included, but most of the time, the pet would be happiest with who it knows. For cats, usually it’s that they don’t get enough exercise, just like dogs. The cat wheels that they can run on is a fix for some behavioral issues, and it can also be hormonal or anxiety and I feel like should be checked with a vet. Like I said, you’re entitled to your own opinion. But I don’t think I’ll ever change my views, and I’m not trying to change yours, to be clear, I hope it doesn’t come off as know it all."

amipregnant,fqjosq9,t1_fqjnnq0,1589413016.0,"You said in your last sentence, that if she has anxiety and OCD that badly, that she needs help for it, this was likely her first step to do it, you don’t tell people “just don’t, and stop it.” You tell them they’ve done good, like this girl has, for realizing she has a fear, and issues. Then you tell her she should get help, instead of making it seem like her fears aren’t something she should worry about, because even if they are, or aren’t, she is still worrying. That’s not really for you to decide, either, if she should be worrying about it. We don’t know her position in life or if she is hiding anything. 

So to her, you, OP, when I was 14, I was also really worried about getting pregnant, I also have severe anxiety, I can’t leave the house, sometimes. Probably OCD, as well. 

I recommend stopping over at r/ocd and discussing your issues there. We can’t help you here, but maybe some advice there will help. Your thoughts don’t define you, and sometimes you’ll have intrusive thoughts that will tell you that you’re pregnant, and they’re just that, thoughts. Not all of our thoughts are right. It’s sometimes hard to come to terms with it, but part of helping your OCD is letting go of thoughts. Intrusive thoughts, and scary thoughts, are normal. Sometimes I’d think of my mom slipping and dying over a drop of water, and panic a bit. But what we both likely need to learn to do is leave those thoughts behind. Let them stay where they are. Think them over, and then leave them. 

I hope that helps, and maybe some exposure therapy, learn more about health and safety. It’s never too early to be educated about women’s anatomy and safe sex, especially when you’ve already had your first period. Stay safe, and try some coping techniques, get help, and if you can’t, google is a great source for learning to handle your thoughts better during a more scary time, like when you’re more anxious and more thoughts flood in. Good luck. ❤️"

Panera,fnx463w,t1_fnx3at8,1587331129.0,"Yeah ours doesn’t let us wear gloves or masks even if we wanted to. Ofc besides when making food when it comes to gloves. 
And no sadly my cafe sucked. My GM has a group chat where she crap talks associates with other associates & managers. It’s not the most friendly. You just gotta brown nose to fit in & if you disagree too bad it felt like, to me. Though others liked it, mostly because the managers liked them. Wasn’t a very equal store. Some people can wear certain things, other people can’t wear the exact same thing, rules just weren’t enforced equally. Depended on who you were."
Panera,fnww64p,t1_fnwgj3s,1587326637.0,"Idk where you are but here it’s just a bit stupid. Our county is mandated to wear face masks for the last 3 weeks & our county has the most cases in the state besides the one next to us I’m pretty sure. Almost 3k cases in my county, it’s just stupid that they (idk if for you) but they at the beginning had given us papers that said not to wear face masks they don’t help, and now they say to wear them & haven’t gotten any in more than a week or two after the county mandated it. I’m probably sounding negative but after staying there for so long the place just irks me now haha."
Panera,fnwan3q,t1_fnw6uxg,1587314726.0,My cafe said that & my friend said that they still don’t have them at my cafe even tho they said they’re supposed to have some.

Panera,fnpo91u,t1_fnp7qho,1587148990.0,"I know people at my cafe who like it, but it’s because they’re favored by the manager. Some have a group chat with her."
