EDAnonymous,fgqo0p2,t3_ej86dm,1581027900.0,"I'm so not the right person to be answering this but I can remove and replace my ng tube with ease on a daily basis.  Mind you I'm going on 3 years of personal experience.  If you can swallow a pill you place and remove a tube.  May I ask what french your tube is?  I can't stand anything above a 10 F for long term placement.  Also, some tubes are just not as pliable as others which makes them more uncomfortable than others.  Corpak and Kangaroo are my preference.  Weighted J tubes are the worst things on the planet but are needed in some cases.

I'm assuming your tube is obviously for an eating disorder.  If you want to yank it out because it's uncomfortable you need to talk to your doctor and tell them it's painful.  A lot of people inpatient or not being treated with ED feel like they can't say anything about personal discomfort which is SO wrong.  You are paying for it you have every right to speak up and to be as comfortable as possible while you are going through some pretty rough stuff.  On the other hand, some of it is part of ED.  The mental aspect of this tube ""defeating"" your ED can be causing physical discomfort from a mental aspect.

I don't have ED, I have other medical problems that calls for tube feeds.  I hope you are seeking advice on your road to recovery and not trying to skirt around the treatments required therapy.  Best of luck, when in doubt don't rip it out, contact your doctor and express your discomfort."

I am sure you have had everyone you know tell you how sorry they are for your loss, I've been there.  After you hear it so many times it gets old so I won't say it.  This is the hardest part... onset, when it feels like someone has reached into your soul and ripped it from your chest, it's probably the worst pain a human can experience.  It's unavoidable and must be endured.  How you choose to cope with it is solely your choice (please try not to self destruct, please) if you want to be alone, be alone and don't worry about what everyone else thinks you should be doing, if you want to cry... sob, throw things... whatever it is your pain, not anyone else's and how you cope doesn't have to be some kind of inspirational story about strength...  I wished people told me that instead of just telling me how sorry they were for my loss.  There's no handbook on how one is supposed to react to a suicide, everyone puts on the kid gloves and wants to be there for you which is something to appreciate in theory but in real-world applications can just be overwhelming.

While I am sorry for your loss I want you to know you are free to feel what you feel and you don't have to do or be any specific way... just keep breathing and seek help if that's something you really need to do... just keep breathing"

BPD,fb3ozly,t3_eb11kw,1576481706.0,"Oh dear God yes... My parents didn't physical abuse me and I never wanted for anything so my parents think that they were the best parents ever.  I needed compassion, occasional praise, and direction... None of that was ever a priority to them.  They lived with the philosophy children are to be seen not heard religiously.  I was always told I was ungrateful, that I was naive (basically stupid,) and always accused of attention seeking.  I was supposed to basically raise myself quietly in the background.

My feeling and emotion needs were always dismissed.  My achievements were never acknowledged because my parents considered just doing what you are supposed to but if I fucked up there was hell to pay.  My mom turned everything into a personal slight... She thought all my fuck ups were solely to embarrass her like I planned them out for months or something.

They don't talk to me anymore because everything wrong with my life is considered self imposed agony."

AskDocs,fapvybi,t1_fapqfyg,1576294215.0,It's the internet.  If they wanted only doctor's responses that would block unverified users.
BPD,fapv4v4,t1_fapatkt,1576293884.0,"Are we going to pretend that people don't use abuse claims falsely...  

No one deserves to be abused.  No one deserves to be called and abuser as a manipulation device either.  I'm a victim of abuse.  I don't care if anyone believes or doesn't believe me because the state of Texas put someone in prison over it.

Everything is a stigma but we can't assume that everyone cares enough to not use the legal and social loopholes the size of a galaxy for their benefit."
BPD,faohkk0,t3_ea3wa9,1576264509.0,"People fear what they don't understand or rather people fear what they choose NOT to even remotely try to understand.

People love to be ""victims"" and tell their ""survivor"" stories.  The vast amount of people claiming to be victims of BPD abusers weren't.  They needed to vilify their ex so they don't have to be honest with themselves or others because it's so much easier to blame someone instead of just accepting the fact that some relationships just don't work.  Everyone makes mistakes in relationships and some people can not accept the fact that their relationship wasn't a Disney fairytale.

For the love of God never do a youtube search looking for support!  You'll just get an overwhelming flood of people claiming to be experts because they've survived their ex or so and so.  No one deserves to be abused but let's face it 90% of people claiming they are abused aren't but they take their butt hurt to the next level by broadcasting their side of the story on youtube.

There's so much information out there and VERY little actual support for BPD suffers.  Often when we seek help we are called attention-seeking... every time we try to talk about it we are revictimized by people's responses... It's the biggest catch 22 diagnosis EVER."

I always say I feel like an alien from another planet that is just casually tossed into a world of humans to fend for myself.  I watch people do the most normal everyday things and wonder if they are (for instance, while shopping) is she buying that dress because she sincerely loves it or because of the designer label and how other people will think she's well rounded.  It's totally stupid but yet fascinating.  This applies to everything, not just shopping... Is she drinking that kale smoothie because she's a health nut or because she wants to be perceived as health-conscious?  It's like watching an ant farm... it's so interesting but I'm in no way apart of that world."
