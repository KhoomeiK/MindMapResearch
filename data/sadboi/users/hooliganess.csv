madmen,f5vamz4,t1_f5v45f8,1572486030.0,"It's a lot more than a comedy. I think you need to get through the first few episodes to get it. 

I started it and thought it was ok, then dropped it. Later, I came back to it and binged it. It's really so good. Bojack is very similar to Don, and as the series moves forward, it gets very profound. 

In my mind, it's one of the best TV shows ever. The characters develop, a lot happens, systems are examined, and it's very emotionally provoking. 

The cartoon turns some people off, and I understand that, but the show does a lot with the cartoon aspect that's fun. I read, and believe, that the fact that Bojack is a horse actually makes it easier to relate to him. He does some really awful things, just like Don. But somehow, the cartoon aspect removes some of the easy judgement. You feel more free to look at motives and a wide range of emotions. The show covers a lot. 

It's one of the few shows that can capture my full attention because, beyond the surface, which is funny and absurd, it goes deep. I am blown away by how much they pack into nearly every line, and the background is full of puns, art and culture references.

I believe he really wanted the best for her. This scene also shows us Megan hasn't been totally honest about who she was, perhaps even to herself. 

As far as her success, Don helped her in NY, by helping her get the commercial. That rolled into her soap opera role. When she got to LA, she didn't have that advantage. We also begin to see that she's not as laid back as she seemed. She probably wasn't the easiest thing to work with.

I can't believe she wasn't interested in him for more than a hook up. 

I think her interest in copy writing shows how flighty she is. I think she probably was interested because her interest enticed Don, but we see how quickly it goes away. 

Didn't it turn out that this ""friend"" who had been nagging her to go to California wasn't even really a friend? She played that up to look cool to Don. 

She was generally a nice person and she cared about the kids. I don't think that was an act. 

She's young. I don't think she's being manipulative in a mean way. I think she's interested in Don and a new life and she became who she needed to be to get it. Once she got it, she had to come to terms with how she was and what she actually wanted, and she had never shown that to Don. I think she was caught up in the whole love affair."

madmen,f5seoa4,t1_f5s89mi,1572426250.0,"This is good insight.

I think part of Betty's problem is that she is very focused on Don and she wants to be rescued. It's understandable that she would be mad at Don and want him to pick up some slack, but she doesn't try to grow as a parent herself. It's likely that you and your siblings were focused on your own growth and that's why you are different than your mother with children. Just a guess, of course. ðŸ˜Š

As a mother, Betty doesn't change much until she has no choice. She bitches about those kids to Don, then to Henry. She seems to say whatever comes to mind without much thought of how it might hurt her kids. Holding an all day resentment over a stupid sandwich is pretty childish."

I was a kid in the seventies, and everytime I see the guys in later seasons, I'm reminded of my 70's Ken doll. He had real doll hair and came with a stick on facial hair pack. It included beard, sideburns and mustache. He also had the obligatory poly suit. 

The thing is, people really looked like that. My mom was an office worker and wore those crazy plaids and patterns. All my parents friends had that crazy hair and facial hair. I can't speak for the hippie stuff. I have pictures of myself as a kid wearing that nasty polyester. 

My parent's house had so many things like Don and Megan's apartment. Heavy, dark curtains,along with  frosted hanging lamps and mirrors. 

I think it looks crazy, but it's super accurate."
madmen,f5ahkki,t1_f56y3xf,1572107521.0,"Yeah. I think you're right about the general attitude towards kids. One thing that always stood out to me was when Betty was getting ready to go to the Kentucky Derby party and she calls Sally in to zip up her dress. 

Sally says, ""I walked backwards all the way from the living room."" She obviously proud and in a kid moment. Betty completely ignores her and keeps staring into the mirror. 

It's such a small thing but it shows the attention to detail I love about Mad Men. It's a life moment. I can definitely see my mom doing that and she was a good mom. I mean, honestly I would do it too, but I think the difference is I might feel bad about it if I realized it and my mother wouldn't have thought twice about it. 

Betty definitely had her share of stress and I guess when you add that on top of different parenting attitudes, it's easier to see why she may have lashed out in a way that can seem over the top. 

It's such good writing."
madmen,f5agatq,t1_f570i9p,1572106825.0,"Maybe you're right. I'm sure she cares in the way she can. I guess what I mean is, she cares mostly about herself and how she feels. She's a self centered child. As a parent, I would not be happy to see my grown children act the way she acts. 

I've taken care of 2 terminally ill parents, and I upended my life to do so. My life wasn't nearly as cushy as hers at the time. I had those awful discussions just like the one Betty had with her father and I managed to feel terrible but stick it out and realize it wasn't all about me. I think that scene where she yells at Gene for discussing his final plans is one of Betty's worst moments. I think she even tells him to stop being so selfish. That is not how mature adults act towards terminally ill people. 

I realized my brother was a better care taker for my father, and I did what was best for my father without thinking about whether or not my brother would "" get the house."" I appreciated what my loving sister in law did for my father and I didn't worry about the material stuff. 

I was the caretaker for my terminally ill mother and I was not perfect but I sure as hell didn't walk around acting annoyed all the time. 

She may be devestated by Gene's death, but she's still self centered as hell. Naming her son after her father was typical Betty- a grand gesture bitch fit that takes no one into consideration besides herself. I pray to God my kids would not ""honor"" me in that way. Gene is Don's child as much as hers. 

Oh, and I had kids when my parents died, and I loved my parents. Their deaths were overwhelming. But you know what? I managed to put my feelings aside to nurture my children through their own grief and not to ignore them. 

None of this means I'm anything special. It's called being a normal human- to quote Betty, ""It's what people do."" I was also married to an addict who gave Don Draper a run for his money. So, trust me, I know bitterness, loneliness, and loss. 

No one is perfect. I love the complexity of the characters on MM and I love that we get to explore it. A lot of people give Betty a pass because of her life circumstances. I'm simply saying she's not forced to act that way. Early in the show she's bitching about her brother. Whether her issues were from the way she was raised or who she was born to be, she had issues. 

Grand displays of emotion don't always mean someone cares, or that they are a good person.  Sometimes all they care about ( or are capable of caring about) is themselves."

It goes far beyond what Don did to her (which was terrible). I understand that she was probably ill suited to being a mother. She was bored, unhappy, the times, whatever. I've known women like that and they didn't say terrible things that made their kids feel hated. They didn't hold an all day grudge over a damn sandwich. They didn't tell their kids they'd lock them up or cut their fingers off. She had a sweet sister in law and a wonderful Carla and she was rotten to them.

I always think of that scene when Sally shows up for Betty in the end. 

I'm not sure Sally would have much affection looking back on her mother. She lived with Betty and Betty was good at making those kids feel unloved IMO. That kind of thing is pretty damaging. 

Don, for all his faults, seemed to enjoy and be there for Sally when he showed up. He surely did some very messed up things, but I think a constant feeling of being disliked or even hated by your mother who is present is harder to take than anything Don did. 

TL;DR: Simply, it's much easier to see your father's self centeredness and mistakes are about him (especially as you get older) but when your mother makes it all about you, that's hard to get over."

To deal with that shame, he's plunged into addiction. He's an alcoholic and sex addict. He's addicted to the high and escape he gets from attention and addiction. 
An addict is self centered and lies to everyone, including themselves. They can also be powerfully charming. It's what keeps people from killing them. 

As his addictions progress, he hurts those around him, and that perpetuates the shame, insecurity, deep loss and abandonment he feels. Those feelings cause him to continue the cycle and he has to do more of his addictive behaviors to feel better. Any ""clean"" moment brings up all those horrible feelings and soon he's seeking another escape. 

It doesn't matter what pain he's causing himself and others. He doesn't want to feel it. The thing with addiction is, you often need to stop to make real progress. Many people stay stuck because they try to reason things out while still ""using."" 

It's pretty telling that he was able to experience a breakthrough when he was out of his normal patterns and not participating in addictive behaviors. He has a real moment of truth when he's on the phone with Peggy. He confesses his wrongs and gets real about his feelings. That is quickly followed by another moment of catharsis. 

He's a lot of things, but a lot of those things are typical of an addict. An addict is often a person filled with deep shame about their very existence.

madmen,f27dpdi,t3_dbu572,1570035921.0,"My dog had 11 puppies and when they were just starting to bark and yap, my daughter and I watched this episode and they all got quiet when the song came on. After that we played the scene a lot to calm them. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ I even have a picture of my daughter watching this scene on her phone and one of the puppies sitting with her and staring at the screen. Lol"

TheWire,f1ycaqa,t1_f1w5sji,1569813659.0,Right and Herc  was the one who explained to Levy how the police where probably investigating him. That info tipped Levy off to the wire taps and screwed the case. Herc was a tool for sure.
TheWire,f1vq5p9,t1_f1vpess,1569774383.0,I agree. He had already been in a group home and he didn't want to go back. He was afraid of losing Miss Anna. He was a kid. Herc screwed him.

madmen,f1ja3jh,t1_f1i8suv,1569520644.0,"I rewatched Breaking Bad once to get ready for the movie. Aaron Paul's acting stood out to me the second time, but overall it doesn't make me think like MM.

The Wire was my favorite before MM. There's a lot to process in The Wire but it's so incredibly painful. There's a lot of innocent victims in that show. It's more about the system. I rewatched it once.

MM has a lot to keep my interest. The characters often bring on their own problems, but we get to explore what made them that way. It's a very human experience and it's covered in depth for anyone who has the attention for it."
madmen,f1j8i0t,t3_d9ap03,1569520081.0,"MM is the gift that keeps on giving. The depth of all the characters makes it an excellent rewatch. It always keeps me interested. 

The kind of people who understand this are my kind of people."
madmen,f1j73ki,t1_f1j42ml,1569519582.0,I agree about the drudgery to find anything good. MM is a pretty high standard to match.
madmen,f1hr5e0,t1_f1hmhjj,1569499386.0,"I do find it draws my eye to the TV a lot when I have I on in the background.  I've seen it so many times that it works for me more now.

I still really love to sit and watch it, the whole thing is just beautiful."
madmen,f1g0xbb,t1_f1fybzm,1569457437.0,I can't remember when that flashback was. But I'm one of the people who wondered if Peggy's sister adopted the child. I completely missed the pregnant sister the first time through.
madmen,f1g0r86,t1_f1fy5hu,1569457326.0,Yep. I think it's 4 for me and still going

madmen,f1fqsd2,t1_f1d1bmz,1569450755.0,I found it interesting that Vincent Kartheiser said that what people read into his acting has a lot to do with them. He doesn't argue with them about it.
