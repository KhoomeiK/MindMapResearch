Try staying off your phone unless a text or call comes your way. See how you feel in one day and let me know if you find the answer to most of your questions once your mind clears up. I guarantee you will.

And I guarantee you're gonna be a million times less anxious to speak to people no matter who it is. You will learn how to regain your calmness after you keep meditating. It's a crazy experience. Almost a life hack honestly."
