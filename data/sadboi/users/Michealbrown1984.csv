And people are mad that the people don't like her comment that they think she's cringy. That's litterally what the comments are for, they are more than allowed to speak their mind about the content in the comments and if any member of AH or RT doesn't like it then they shouldn't read comments.


Look at Michael and Fionnas tweet, they're targeting all people who say she's not funny (which is quite a large amount of people obviously if they're even making these tweets) they're not saying only people who say she's not funny because she's a girl, which again is such a small percent."

But I'm complaining now because its so silly that she thinks its just because she's a woman. I think all of the other woman in rooster teeth are funny but I don't think she is at all, I also think jack can be annoying sometimes but it wasn't so bad that I had to stop watching the content he was in. Fiona makes me cringe pretty much every time she makes a joke. 

Her doing the ""exact"" same thing as others in a stream is irrelevant because the way she carries herself is cringey, everything she does feels so forced and un funny. She's just not a funny person, and she should be able to admit that people don't find her funny without getting defensive and calling people sexist.

&#x200B;

I don't think she was just a ""forced diversity hire"" but come on guys, you have to understand how someone would think that when a minority is hired that is just so much less funny than every single other person in AH or even in Rooster Teeth.

I mean looking at this sub you'll see a ton of people are already on anti depressants and going to therapy and they say it doesn't help. From my experience (I'm a 19m) the only thing that has ever made me feel better was love, but in reaility few people want to love someone whose depressed and I can't say I blame them it's just not a good risk for them to take for their future imo. So that's never going to be a solution to hope for.

But I do think it's possible to get better. Working on improving yourself and trying everything you can to achieve and find success anywhere in life is a path that can lead to happiness even for people like us. The problem is that isn't easy.

depression,f2537ti,t3_dbz99t,1569965004.0,"Is it just with your friends or with everyone? I tend to find a large majority of people I meet annoying. Its very hard for me to like or get along with anyone my friends included. 

If it's just your friends then get new friends, if it's everyone there's not much you can do but try to ignore it. I think this issue is connected with people having an underlying distrust and/or dislike for people because of something that happened in a person's past. For me I got horribly bullied in middle school by pretty much everyone in my school. Before that I got along really well with everyone and since then I can't stand people before I even meet them. Maybe it's something similar with you."
SuicideWatch,f1wsw8z,t1_f1wfdww,1569789017.0,"Well it's hard not to be stubborn. When your so miserable that you can't seem to catch a break and find the slightest amount of enjoyment out of life it feels like no one will ever understand and there are no answers. I get it. I really do.

Its fucked that happiness has to be earned. And it's hard to earn. But it's possible I've been there.

Thank YOU for giving me the light of day to even read my advice. It is my pleasure to be any help at all to you. I hope you find what your looking for In life."
SuicideWatch,f1weyoe,t1_f1w75uz,1569783905.0,"No one had ever showed interest in me either. Then one day a girl who was way out of my league and who litterally had guys fighting over her showed interest in me. So much so that I had to put in little effort to go out with her. First girl I ever held hands with, cuddled with, kissed, and had sex with. All in 2 months I was 19. She was patient and accepting that I had no experience. 

Sure she left me eventually. But I never thought I would ever even hold hands with a girl. The only people who never have relationships are people who are ginormous assholes AND losers. If your a half decent person at least you'll find a girl eventually. I promise"

Try to get better first."
SuicideWatch,f1w5v1m,t3_dayp38,1569780652.0,"Well why would you? You only get one life and its going to end eventually. The end will come for all of us. So why not see how life works out anyway? Even if your pretty damn sure it's going to be hell why not just wait and see if it gets better? 

You might think whatever is waiting after death couldn't possibly be worth than living a miserable life. But you never know how the rest of your life will be.

Think of what you want to do any try to do it. You might fail or maybe you won't and life will turn around. Either way, death will come eventually but life only happens once."

depression,f1eoeah,t3_d94vqu,1569426778.0,"I hate to be rude to the guy who posted before me. But just adding one thing or a couple things to your daily eating won't help. This people don't understand what it's like to not be hungry when normal people should be and to have a high metabolism.

I'm 5'10 130 lbs. I was 5'10 119 lbs and I'm still gaining. 

You should focus first on trying to start eating 3 meals and ideally 2 snacks a day. If you track that in the my fitness pal app and it still isn't enough calories then that's where you start adding calorie dense things to your diet. (Peanut butter and whole milk are the big two for me.) My biggest tip is to not stop. If you eat under your surplus one day don't sweat it, try again the next day. 


I was bullied l the way through school for being skinny. I never saw a fat kid get bullied once. People thinking they're doctors and they know how to fix it is also obnoxious. Like ""oh why don't you just eat more"" shit like that can really put you in a horrible mood.

Even though I'm close to a healthy bmi now and out of school (I'm a 19m) people still give me shit for it. A woman grabbed my wrist at work the other day and told me I was too skinny. A couple months ago a co worker called me ""string cheese"" it really bothers me and I know what it's like to feel that lack of self confidence. But you can improve it just takes time."
depression,f1a4dml,t3_d8ffl4,1569284943.0,"Well the ""eventually it always gets better"" phrase is a myth. The world is cruel and time doesn't wait. You have to work and put in effort to get better. Ecspecially for people with mental issues like depression happiness is earned and not given away. 

It sucks, it really does. But it's cruel to tell people that life will get easier when sometimes it just doesn't. It's very hard to earn happiness but I'm confident it is possible for everyone. It's harder for some than others but that just means it will be more of an accomplishment when you do.

Id recommend seeking help and starting to excersise. Again those two thinks will probably be quite difficult.


I hope this helped, if you have anymore questions please ask."

I've had several close female friends before and after her and when I lost her I wanted nothing more than to just keep her in my life in any way. It think you'd regret not having her in your life even if she doesn't want a romantic relationship with you. I thought exactly like you did untill I lost the girl for good.

Maybe we just differ in opinion but I think you should give it a shot."
depression,f0vo9p4,t3_d6uy51,1568987592.0,"Then don't ask her out yet. Try to be friends with her first. Get to know her, get her number or social media and start up some conversations. Then you can tell her how you feel. If she has a boyfriend stay her friend and be there for her so if and when she is single she'll see you as someone who will care for her unconditionally.

It may work, it may not. But if you really love her it's better to have her in your life as a friend than not at all."

It's hard for me to get any companionship though. I'm a very irritable person it's really easy for me to not like someone and hard for me to like someone. Its rare that I don't think someone else is obnoxious and I'm in a pretty hateful mood constantly tbh. That's not anyone elses fault though it's just mine but I don't know how to change it or change the way I think of most other people. 

Because of that it's hard for me to find people who I'm happy around. Much less that want to be my friend."

After 2 years of trying to stay consistent enough with eating more and working out I finally managed to get results.

I managed to get into a relationship with a great girl out of complete luck, she made all the moves and I have no idea why she was ever in to me I'm a giant loser.

Then in the same month the consistency of working out broke and I just quit and she left me.

Now we're right back were we started. Those 3 months were great though."
depression,f0ktbrt,t3_d58luq,1568687552.0,"I do this a lot and it always leads to the same weird train of thought.

I start day dreaming about driving to places I've always wanted to see, then I get happy thinking about leaving behind my lack of friends, shit job, family that doesn't seem to care much and all of the people I work with that I hate. Then I think about the few people that might actually care enough to be worried if I go missing and think of them blowing up my phone a couple days after I leave. And then the people who have fucked me over recently apologizing and tbh that makes me feel good for people to actually realize how I feel. But then I think because I would like that last part that maybe i'm just doing it for attention and then I feel like a piece of garbage and feel like shit for a couple of hours. Then I forget about this thought process until something makes me think of it again and the cycle repeats."

Couldn't figure it out in the slightest. And eventually after a minute or two of trying to figure it out she just pushed me off her and said let's just watch a movie. She didn't want to hang out with me or anything after that night and eventually cut of the relationship. She knew I was a virgin going into it but I guess she expected it to come naturally and I'm some freak who is so out of touch with basic human instincts that I couldn't figure out the most natural human thing on the planet. I've never felt so humiliated and less of a man in my life. All I wanted to do was make her happy and it's not her fault that I couldn't satisfy her.  I really liked her and everything was going great untill that night it's like we hit a wall and she started quickly losing interest. There's a lot more to that story but she doesn't want anything to do with me anymore and she told me she thinks I'm a loser and she regrets ever being with me. 

I just don't know why I struggle so much with something that should be natrual. I feel like Im just not man enough"
