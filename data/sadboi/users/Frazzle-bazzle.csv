Like maybe a welcome home party or planning learning activities or really anything to do with Baby that she can have to her self?

You could also say I want to make sure we are all on the same page so there’s no opportunity for misunderstandings and we can all focus on how amazing it is to be adding this new life to our family.

Edit: I would also recommend removing “I just wanted” and make it stronger. “Husband and I have made a plan for the birth and we want to share the plan with you”.

Then extend the boundaries out around you a few inches. Keep breathing to fill that space with pink and purple light. Then extend it out even further. 
Focused users can fill a whole room with beautiful, peaceful, joyful pink and purple light.

Shampoo every day with a small amount (like maybe a nickel and really be sure to lather into the scalp and around your ears. Your ends don’t need as much. I’m saying this to help you use less product. Something simple in a nice big bottle might be good. 

Conditioner only needs to go from the ears down, and again you don’t need too much (especially since you can let it soak in for a few minutes before rinsing it out). 

Honestly maybe just try buying whatever is on clearance or on sale until you hit something you like?
