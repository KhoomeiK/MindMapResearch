BipolarReddit,fr52s7q,t1_fr1lqgw,1589901479.0,"I have the same reaction to sativa dominant vs indica dominant strains. I used to be able to smoke any kind of weed but now if I smoke anything but indica I get hella anxious. Even indica dominant hybrids can be iffy. THC and I do not mix. 

It sucks because I used to really enjoy the happy feeling that are associated with sativa. But alas, I can’t smoke those anymore."

BipolarReddit,fqx1gd4,t1_fqwgpqs,1589723531.0,I loved both of these shows but thanks bringing up that episode of Modern Love! I cried so hard at the scene where she’s telling her new friend she’s bipolar at lunch. I know exactly what that feels like.
BipolarReddit,fqt9eo6,t1_fqr4pkw,1589633810.0,"I’ve been reading a lot more and doing commissions for art! Also been applying to a lot of jobs. It’s definitely been harder to maintain my mental illness because routine always helped me so much, but thankfully I started lamictal recently and that’s been helping too."

BipolarReddit,fp370jg,t1_fp0zm7a,1588274194.0,"Yeah, questioning confidence, happiness, and energy is such a bummer. It’s not something that I think people that aren’t Bipolar understand. But I know I’m better off in the long run for taking stock of it."
BipolarReddit,fozwi7h,t3_gahj4o,1588198110.0,"When I’m hypo I have to *focus* on sleeping. It can be kind of a negative feedback loop because stress often triggers a hypomanic episode for me, and then trying to go to sleep (when I know it’ll be hard) creates so much anxiety that I can have panic attacks just because I’m getting into bed. 

When I finally do get to sleep it’s usually only about 2 or 3 hours. All the while, during the day, my heart and thoughts are always racing, my anxiety is usually worse and I’m irritable. The euphoric parts happen too, but I’ve learned to question it — that part sucks the most."
BipolarReddit,foux364,t3_g9nlr1,1588091821.0,"The accommodations I asked for were:
— a defined sick day policy (I.e how many days can you miss of class without penalty). If there already was one, I negotiated for as many per semester as felt appropriate. I usually asked for at least 5.
— flexible deadlines like you stated! 
— A ‘note-taker’. We didn’t have the ability to record lectures most of the time at my school, but the professor could identify a person who could share notes for missed classes. 

There are also lots of others you can ask for. Remember that this is your legal right! Good luck getting the accommodations you need."
BipolarReddit,fou02wx,t3_g9b0km,1588072159.0,This sounds like a tough situation. I’m sorry that things suck right now. Try to remember you are great! And your environment doesn’t determine your worth.
BipolarReddit,for3gr0,t3_g8np38,1588005527.0,I am constantly questioning every important decision I make. Sometimes I make a mental pro/con list about stuff or put myself in the other person’s shoes to figure out how I handled something in the moment. But it’s hard to trust your gut when you’re bipolar. This is something I struggle with all the time.
BipolarReddit,foga5co,t3_g6ynhz,1587749946.0,Exactly what it feels like for me too.
BipolarReddit,fog9up0,t3_g76rzb,1587749832.0,"This is a tricky one because there are lots of studies that show weed can be bad for mania/hypomania. I personally can only smoke indica and even then I have to be careful. It can help me get to sleep and take the edges off of anxiety.  Each strain is so different and affects me specifically, so I don’t mess around with weed that I don’t know the composition of. It’s much harder to figure that out in a state where it’s not legal, so I’d just practice caution if you can. I, of course, am not a medical professional so none of this advice should be taken as such."
BipolarReddit,fog8kiv,t3_g6urg6,1587749335.0,Yeah I have described it as feeling ‘like my skin is crawling’

BipolarReddit,fog72z6,t3_g79sdq,1587748761.0,"I have 20 lbs Calm Blanket (that’s the name of the brand). I LOVE it. It’s not a miracle worker for sleep problems, but it definitely soothes some of the sharper bits of anxiety. They recommend certain weights based on body weight for the brand but I wish I had ordered the heaviest one."
BipolarReddit,fog67gj,t3_g71d70,1587748425.0,"The two are tied so closely together for me that it’s hard to tell. But the thing that sets the two apart is the sleep issues. If I take sleep aid(s) and lay in bed without being able to sleep for hours, I can usually bet a hypomanic episode is starting. If it lasts more than a couple of days, the irritability sets in."
BipolarReddit,fo9m222,t3_g5ygia,1587623545.0,Definitely. It’s such a weird feeling.
BipolarReddit,fnq9o6t,t3_g2xb6o,1587160373.0,(26 F) I still am not sure about having kids biologically. I’m honestly less worried about passing down the illness (the chances are fairly low and even if it happened I would be there to support them). I’m more worried about the lack of sleep that a newborn demands and the inevitable episodes that would result from that. I think if I decide to raise kids that I will adopt  instead. I have other reasons for that as well — climate change being the biggest.
BipolarReddit,fn5dfmk,t3_fyx4sa,1586661987.0,"Always starts with bad sleep then other symptoms start soon after like a need to talk to as many people as possible, a sudden urge to tell everyone that I love them, and excessive scrolling on social media."

I try to go to sleep and wake up at the same time every night/morning. This can be hard when in a mood state obviously, but the routine helps me avoid it. I also try to avoid social stuff at nighttime as it has proven to help avoid hypomania for me."

IAmA,fly4262,t3_frv7op,1585595143.0,I’ve heard that BP is a progressive disease. How often does BP2 turn into BP1? Are there ways to prevent it?
BipolarReddit,flxpauw,t3_frkrsa,1585587259.0,"One term into college (age 18) the stress was getting to me. Went from happy, confident, and social to depressed in the span of a few days and it didn’t feel right. My dad also has BP and I became unfortunately very aware of unmedicated symptoms early on in life. Suspected I “had the bug” and went to a Doctor to see if I was right. I was. 8 years later and I’ve been diagnosed BP 2 again by 2 other doctors since then. I’ve kept it under control with therapy, routine, and a super strict sleeping pattern but I’m gonna start medicating soon. I’m actually really nervous about starting meds and getting it right. Tried lithium when I was first diagnosed at 18 and I was massively depressed for months because of it."

BipolarReddit,floldxi,t1_flnrfbe,1585340549.0,I also get up and read a chapter in a book every 2 or so hours if laying there isn’t helping to try to “re-set” if that makes sense. Sometimes I end up scrolling social media but I’ve found that I can zone out really easily when scrolling and fall down an internet hole.
BipolarReddit,flojmuh,t1_flnrfbe,1585339571.0,"This is only my experience, of course, but when I can tell the hypomanic episode is getting worse I just lay in bed, take melatonin and benedryl as sleep aids. Even with this, I can still end up laying there for hours and hours and not get to sleep. But I force myself to lay there even if I’m itching to get up and do something. Again, it doesn’t always work."
BipolarReddit,flojajn,t1_flnru3h,1585339382.0,He helps by making sure I eat and drink water in my very worst states. When otherwise I would not eat or drink at all. I endlessly thank him for his help and make sure he doesn’t feel taken advantage of even in the middle of these episodes. This comment was mean-hearted.
BipolarReddit,flnj8g6,t1_flnef1d,1585319750.0,"Thanks for this reply. I have trouble sometimes with feeling guilty about boundaries I’ve set after the fact, even if they were fair and necessary. I appreciate the words of support!"
BipolarReddit,flnebwl,t3_fpqiwg,1585316690.0,"Irritability and anxiety are two of my most common symptoms toward the end of a hypomanic episode. Usually the irritability and anxiety are worse the longer the hypomania lasts. From my experience, what you’re going through is a normal manifestation of hypomania. Starting out, one of the things that helped me the most was identifying when a hypomanic episode started and tracking my mood/symptoms from there on out. The longer it lasted, the more I tried to keep myself calm and focus on nothing else but getting to sleep."
BipolarReddit,flndbcc,t3_fpsuz4,1585316008.0,"That is really rough. I’m sorry that you feel unsafe! If you have no other choice but to go back, do everything you can to decrease your risk of exposure. Avoid people actively sneezing and coughing, stay 6 ft apart from everyone if possible, and don’t touch your face. The virus can’t infect you unless it enters through a mucus membrane, so by doing these things you should be okay. Remember that people that are actively sick are mostly staying home, so these days you are less likely to come into contact with it if you are cautious. If it helps, you can wear gloves as well!"
BipolarReddit,fli86vu,t3_fovqki,1585177194.0,"Just waking up, taking 1 or 2 showers a day, eating enough food, and walking around will help to some degree. I agree with the person who said to structure your day somehow if possible. Don’t feel the need to be productive in ways that aren’t something you’re used to. Tell someone you love right now about being in a depressive state. Maybe someone who is more familiar with what that means if you have someone to call. I’d say if it gets bad enough reach out to someone you can talk to over the phone that will respect your feelings and mostly listen."
BipolarReddit,fli7kub,t3_fowz3m,1585176857.0,"I hate it. Even when I logically know if I’m hypomanic or depressed, I can’t change my thought patterns or behavior. It’s exhausting. I simultaneously want to explain and not explain what’s going on with the people I live with. I only trust my husband to be around me even though I have other people that could help. Being dealt this lot in life feels unfair but I have to keep on living it out anyways. This reddit does help because I can see that there are others that deal with the same stuff. But yes, it’s exhausting to be bipolar and I wish I wasn’t."

This is the number of the national suicide prevention hotline. If you’re feeling bad enough but are worried about going to the hospital, call this number. Tell work you’re sick until you’re feeling yourself again. Hope this helps!"
BipolarReddit,fl2lg90,t3_flpw1j,1584753844.0,"Call friends or family. Take a walk everyday. Even if it’s just down the sidewalk. Try to maintain as normal of a routine as possible (what do you usually do when you wake up? Keep doing that.) Avoid media (including social) if things are getting overwhelming. Talk to people you know and trust about what you’re feeling if you need it! 

A lot of us are in similar boats right now."
BipolarReddit,fl2l0t7,t3_fm4in0,1584753549.0,"It manifests as trouble sleeping, impulse control (scrolling for way longer than normal on social media is my version of that), and irritability. I also talk a lot faster if there’s people around."

BipolarReddit,fjsskpr,t3_fewsx3,1583600143.0,"They’re technically not allowed to fire you BECAUSE of it, but could easily make up another reason. There is so much stigma related to Bipolar that I’d highly recommend NOT telling them you have it. I have done so in the past and it hasn’t gone well for me — even with people who I thought were my friends/would be understanding."
BipolarReddit,fiyvn4y,t3_fag9l6,1582847988.0,"First of all, I’m so impressed with your strength in making this decision! Taking a leap is something that can be really scary and it’s very smart that you’re thinking of the potential effects of this before starting. Sleep disruption is definitely a tricky problem. Check in with yourself regularly. Regular appointments with your case worker and calling on that support network if you need it will be essential. Be emotionally prepared to put your health first if it needs to happen. Good luck! I’m definitely rooting for you."
BipolarReddit,fiyupus,t3_fak59u,1582847381.0,"Yes, it’s so frustrating. A tiny micro aggression that seems to be no big deal, but feels like a tiny jab. I’ve had multiple conversations with friends about avoiding that phrase and thankfully most have been receptive."
BipolarReddit,fixz2oa,t3_fa56ed,1582829251.0,"A while back I made the mistake of letting one of my managers know I was BP2 and tried describing what hypomania was like for me. This company didn’t provide health insurance and definitely didn’t have paid sick days. So once she saw my hypomania for herself. Instead of letting me go home like I asked, she equated my experience with her anxiety and got me to smoke and sent me out to work anyways. 

I did everything I could to protect myself but was still young and felt like I needed to do what the boss expected of me. Long story short, I ended up in a situation of intense discrimination with these people and could’ve brought legal action against them but decided it would be too emotionally exhausting. I’m much more careful about what I disclose to my coworkers and managers now, and don’t trust when people say they’re open to talking about mental illness. It was a hard and life changing lesson."
