AskStatistics,fpb5buy,t1_fpa7z26,1588462429.0,"You could use fleiss kappa to see the level of agreement between respondents for all health outcomes as a whole, but it would only give you a number between 0 and 1 to describe the level of agreement overall--but all of your previous work would have teased out the meaningful information as to which ones are more variable, or which ones are more important.

I don't see how you have enough data for cohens kappa to measure intra rather reliability? Is there an expected ranking that you have for each health outcome?  Maybe if 5 is the expected ""null"" value (neither unimportant or important for a health outcome) maybe you could perform cohens kappa on that? But that would depend on the wording of your survey and the meanings of the rankings. Otherwise cohens kappa would allow you to do pairwise comparisons between respondents, or groups of respondents (if you expect there to be differences). If you're just doing pairwise comparisons, then that's just repeating fleiss kappa."
AskStatistics,fpa7hdy,t1_fpa2e5e,1588442367.0,"Since you're looking at differences between health outcome ratings by raters, you can keep it simple and look at the range of ratings for each health outcome. The smaller the range, the less variability there is for that health come, and the more consistent that respondents feel it is more (or less) important. You could rank the health outcomes by the range and median of respondent answers. That will tell you which health outcome is consistently more important by respondents. A nice way to show this could be something like a graph of nine box plots (one for each health outcome).

So what does that change, exactly? How does what your peers think of your abilities actually affect you? Do they have the power to kick you out of the program? If your PI thought you were a hopeless cause, don't you think he would have said something already?  Does any of this actually change what you're getting out of this degree?

You're here to get better at what you do, not prove to your peers that you deserve to be there.

You have an amazing opportunity to continue on in your dream school with your chosen PI and you want to throw it away? Would you throw away a winning lottery ticket that you find lying on the street because you didn't buy it?

You say that your peers also say they don't belong in this program. What then is this arbitrary threshold for who deserves to be in the program, who gets to dictate that, and why are you below it? Lets say that you quit. By that logic, shouldn't your peers quit too? They also seem to think that they're not smart enough to be in this program."
GradSchool,fp3czfi,t1_fp0kqoq,1588277158.0,"Financial hardship wasn't really the stressor in our case. We saved before starting the PhD, and I took on an extra TAship at one point for extra money. Most of the stress was from being first time parents, having a sick child, and how that impacted our relationship. We both agreed that we would take on debt if it was needed, and true to his word, my husband has not held it against me.

The problem with finances is that if something comes up and you can't afford it, the more you may regret doing the PhD and the more resentful your wife may become. Worse yet is when that something is related to baby. When you become a family unit, there are expenses associated with being a family. For example, if it was just me I would've opted to live somewhere small and cheap, but with a husband and baby, we chose to go over budget for housing. 

By the way, babies don't need a lot of stuff--they only need a car seat, some onesies, diapers, and bottles and formula if you decide not to breastfeed. The majority of baby expenses come from daycare and medical bills. I read about a lady that was billed for both a vaginal delivery and a c-section because she had an emergency c-section. Also, do not think that you can be a stay at home grad-student-parent to save on daycare. Working from home with a baby means not working while at home with a baby.

For us, up until I did the PhD we had been almost living like two separate individuals in parallel with some compromises mixed in. For example, when we bought our only car, we each picked what we wanted and compromised. The PhD was the first time that I realized we needed to develop a unified vision of what we wanted our lives to look like, and then figure out how to achieve that as a team. It was easier to imagine the end game and work backwards than it was to decide what we wanted to do next, if that makes sense. 

If you really want to think things through, then you need to imagine possible ways that the end game you envision can be derailed.  For example, if you both agree to do the PhD, what happens when it takes you three extra years than planned? What if you agree to baby and she decides after birth she'd rather be a stay at home mom than go back to being the breadwinner? If you make a vision and execute as a team then you will be able to weather whatever you two decide because the goal is to get you both back on track. If you decide as two compromising individuals, then she may grow resentful when things don't go to plan (since she has more to lose than you in this arrangement and 4+ years is a long time) and you may grow increasingly frustrated and guilty that your PhD ultimately landed you on this path.

End of philosophical diatribe."

GradSchool,fp0h36i,t3_gacrlp,1588209139.0,"I would say the decision to leave your job to pursue school is mostly your own decision, but the two things that you really, really need to hash out with your wife is where you stand on kids/childcare/housework and money. Having a baby is a life changing event in any case and you need to be a team on it. As in, work out potential scenarios. Volunteer to babysit a niece or nephew for multiple days if you can. Will your wife be supportive or resentful when she's on her fifth day of no sleep, baby's crying, and you insist that you have a deadline for your PhD? The second--what if you do your PhD and you end up taking longer than planned? Is she ok with postponing kids? How long will your wife support you continuing in a program that is starting to make you depressed (because you should've been done by now) while your wife is the only one making a salary and you have one or two kids? 

I went back to school for a PhD for similar reasons, but my husband insisted we had a child first. We had a baby and it was so, so hard. It was a really rough time for us. My son had some health problems to boot. I couldn't relate to others in my group since I was the only one with a kid. I had to submit unfinished homework for required classes. A friend of mine took years to finish, even though he is such a bright guy. His projects would get delayed (I.e. Data collection didn't work out; equipment failed).

And among my peers, it's more often than not the woman's job to handle daycare pickup and drop off. Even studies show that women are more likely to do daycare pickup and drop off, while their husbands go directly to work. Then women are more likely to pick up groceries on the way home, while their husbands go home directly.

While my sister pushed to let her kids try fun ways of learning rather than testing excessively, her boss(es) would give her grief if she couldn't count the number of books read, the number of words spelled correctly on spelling tests, the number of worksheets sent home, standardized testing results, the number of hours spent on specific programs, etc. And some of the pressure came from parents too, who thought she wasn't doing her job unless their kid was overloaded. Now that there is a pandemic, they are just pushing teachers to do demonstrable things in other ways, like work packets and online meetings. 

Teachers who love to teach get forced to do measurable things by people above them, and by parents too. At the end of the day, some administrator somewhere is just ensuring that they can check off a box of demonstrable items to show someone above them that the kids are still learning. By no means is what you're seeing what all teachers collectively think is the ideal teaching model for quarantined kids.

Since you're looking to cut back on your stress, software related positions around 85k in English only positions could be a good fit. Higher positions that are English only do exist but are not as plentiful.  I think the federal government attracts a lot of people from private who want out of the race and want better life balance, like being able to pick their kids up from school everyday or taking time off to travel."

YangForPresidentHQ,fewuc6q,t3_eqrath,1579419613.0,"There are many reasons, but I will illustrate with one example.

I used to work as a minimum wage retail clerk. I can tell you that boosting the minimum wage would simply mean shifts and hours cut for employees. The ones hardest hit by that at my store were the ones who needed to stitch together multiple part time retail jobs to make a basic living that was honestly, near poverty. Big box retail companies staff their stores with the absolute bare number of people. That's why it's so hard to get a clerk to help you when you shop there.

Universal basic income of $1000/month would mean lots of people suddenly having more income to shop. More sales in retail stores would mean more staffed hours (since staffing is determined by sales). So people would have more money to spend, and staff would be able to actually get enough hours if they wanted to work those hours instead of working multiple jobs. Also, the minimum wage employees who I worked with who struggled to get by would have benefitted immensely from $1000/month over a higher minimum wage. Consider just how many hours at minimum wage somebody would need to work to be able to make $1000/month after tax. This kind of illustration is why I think UBI is the better solution."

They set it up so I had both a mortgage with them, and a separate property tax account with them (not like chequing or savings, it was tied to my mortgage). The first tax bill, the account was short so instead of contacting me for the difference, they paid the property tax bill shortage so that my property tax account at Scotia was negative (but I was paid up with the city). Then, they started to charge me interest on the negative account balance. When I found out, I asked them if I could pay my Scotia property tax account to bring it back to zero to avoid the interest charges. They said no!

As in, only privileged women can choose to stay home right now but that currently underprivileged women cannot choose to. Focusing on choice as a result of the dividend.

Perhaps OP could also consider that finances are (likely) not what's stopping men from choosing to be stay at home dads--it seems like finances are more of a deciding factor for women than men. Andrew Yang would likely cite some other factor, based on current data, if he were asked about enabling men to choose to stay home.
