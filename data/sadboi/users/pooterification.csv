If it's bad science, then get rid of it. Our criminal justice system doesn't need to spend all that money prosecuting people only to find out, OOPSIE, looks like your case is thrown out due to faulty evidence. _However__, we do desperately need a way to find out if someone is driving impaired by weed.

Tolerance exists with every drug, including alcohol, and it is ALL equally dangerous after a certain threshold regardless of your tolerance. The ones with a drinking problem almost always have a ""high tolerance"", or what they consider a high tolerance, and then go kill a family with their car. 

And other drugs? Yes, it's valid to consider the danger of driving under the influence of other drugs, but bringing up your concern as a way to distract from the issue at hand is called ""what aboutism"" and it's a logical fallacy. Just bc _a_ is dangerous, doesn't make _b_ any less dangerous. 

Getting a valid impairment test is the key to national legalization and I'm not against that. Driving under the influence is so unbelievably dangerous and STUPID considering getting a ride is a matter of pushing a button you're already always holding."

I would really suggest doing a quick Google search about mindfulness and really thinking about how it might benefit you. I also suggest doing some research on your therapists.

You wanted to know what helps and I told you. There are so many studies out there about how beneficial mindfulness can be, but any treatment is only as effective as what you're willing to put into it. 

For me, the primary reason I go to therapy is to have a knowledgeable sounding board that can provide some guidance on ways to work on myself based on the things I say. Therapy is what you make it. Unhappy with your therapist? Think about why and find a new one that doesn't do those things. Unhappy with that therapist? Find a new one. Rinse repeat. 

Emotions are complicated. There isn't going to be a list of finite tasks to complete that will magically fix you. It takes exploration, trial and error, patience, self-love, and, yes, knowledge and guidance from an expert."

I would suggest exploring mindfulness with a therapist specializing in it so they can give you better direction that is knowledgeable, supervised, and unique to your situation.

Call your PCP's office asap (check when they open) and ask to speak to your doctor's nurse or the triage nurse and tell them what's going on. That is your best bet for a quick response.

I love this. Your other comments suggested you are open to interpretation and I'm feeling particularly inspired.

Your title, ""Don't Touch Your Face"" is incredibly relevant and topical and it hits home for me. This makes me think of That Fear™️ that comes after you realize you absent-mindedly scratched your nose after touching a hand rail on public escalator or something similar... And now convinced I definitely have coronavirus. I also have had acne since I was a preteen straight into the present in my early thirties. I can't tell you how many times I've been told to not touch my face. There's That Fear™️ again. The former being around my health and safety, the latter being about my vanity and self-esteem. Everything has to be so intentional and cautious and it's stressful. It's something that could make a person __crack__.

I've found crafting is much more pleasant for me. Sometimes they are crafts that I completely thought of on my own, other times when I see cool things on the internet, I try to make it myself. Not for selling or anything but just for my apt. Sometimes I just walk into a craft store and look for clearance or sale items and go from there. Or I go off of something I found at a thrift store. 

You mentioned weight gain so I'm going to suggest my favorite activity for exercise. Disc golf! It's cheap, easily accessible, and more often than not includes some really great people. 

On that same note, taking an interest in nutrition/cooking/gardening has been rewarding not just as a hobby, but for my body, too. Growing something from the just a seed, soil, and sunlight is a trip and then making delicious dishes from that?! Even cooler. 

That being said, I want to add my 2 cents. You will never be happy if you compare yourself to other people. I still struggle with it, but it's gotten a lot better in the last decade. There's always going to be someone better, faster, stronger, prettier, skinnier, healthier, etc. And those people are going to be the loudest, most noticable. For every super star overachiever, there's 100 regular Joe schmoes just living their life making ends meet. In addition, everyone on social media is full of shit. They post the best parts of their lives and omit the bad stuff and most of the time it's straight up a giant lie.

This was when the Catholic Church ~~indoctrinated~~ _introduced as a primary part of the religion_ The Virgin Mary™ into the church, as a way for women to feel like they belong and to bring more people in. And it worked! At this point in time, the Catholic Church were like suffragists for not completely condemning women and wanting them to feel loved and valued, albeit a warped version of the idealistic woman, but my point stands."

I guess I'm still confused for a few reasons the first and foremost being that the post is on a subreddit that condemns the idea of men writing terrible female characters. It's not exactly a sub for praising literature let alone one the most misogynistic works to have as much influence on society as Paradise Lost. Also Milton's Eve is a fucking terrible character for the exact reason that this sub exists."
menwritingwomen,fjbdcnt,t3_fcfuuy,1583190860.0,"Paradise Lost, though an important part of our historical literature, is fucking terrible and infuriating.

This started out sounding like things I've experienced and then got to a very scary place.

The subtle hints you're picking up aren't imagined or overdramatic. It sounds like behavior similar to narcissists-- every single thing they do is deniable. And if you bring it up, you're the crazy one. 

You are valid. You have every right to feel the way you feel, not bc myself or anyone on Reddit says so, but bc your feelings are real. You are doing the right thing, you are handling it very well. Continue to calmly back away, keep your support group strong and informed."
antidepressants,fis41wn,t3_f9hs6d,1582677305.0,"It's definitely subjective and complicated.

I've tried so many medications over the last 9 years and have yet to find a long term option that works, but I've had all the terrible side effects, including sexual dysfunction...which is frustrating to say the least.

As someone who used to have a high libido, I feel like a different person in a bad way. If I found a med that worked and I was functional and content, I wouldn't care as much about not having or wanting sex as much. 

In addition, a relationship is certainly not all about sex, but there is that missing intimacy that I think is natural to crave with someone you love. Snuggling helps, but it's just not the same unfortunately. 

[Aside from the rare occurrence of asexuality] I think sexuality is such a basic instinct for human beings and to not have it is to feel less alive and incomplete in a way. 

Then again, some people don't mind skipping sex or having very infrequent sex and that's 100% okay, too. Like I said, subjective and complicated."
misophoniasupport,fis1xqe,t3_f9hdzg,1582675945.0,"Okay so I know it's not ideal to have to move, but you may find some peace in an apartment building that doesn't allow dogs. I know this doesn't guarantee someone in a neighboring house not having a dog, but from my experience of living in dog-restricted apartments the last decade of my life, I never hear dogs. My parents, however, own a home surrounded by homeowners (no apartment buildings, no condos, no retirement homes, etc) and there are dogs barking nonstop, Summers are the _worst_ partly bc everyone has their windows open (I _loathe_ the screams of the neighbor children) and bc everyone is outside or don't mind leaving their dogs out for long periods of time.

I hope this helps or at least adds to your brainstorming. It sounds terrible what you're going through. Petition your neighbors to all get cats (totally kidding)."

I'm not against them for anyone else, what works, works, but I feel like the dietary restrictions would make life pretty hard for me. 

Thank you for telling me about low dose lithium, that actually makes me feel a lot better. It would only be for depression. Out of my 9 years of treatment for depression-- trying antidepressant after antidepressant, I've only been manic when I was on too much sertaline and we're not absolutely sure it was mania bc the symptoms were a little wonky. Still the worst."

Take it for 3-4 says, then don't take it the following 3-4 days, otherwise my tolerance built too quickly and it wouldn't work after so long. 

I apologize if you said you've tried it before, I didn't see it in your list. Hopefully it helps.

Treatment resistant depression is brutal, hang in there. Any thoughts about ketamine treatments? Not very affordable yet, but possibly in the near future. I,
 am patiently waiting on that option bc I feel like I'm getting to the end of the line. The next med my Dr wants me to try is lithium and I kinda don't want to do it bc it's notorious for weight gain, but I guess I'll try anything."
depressionregimens,fiojco5,t3_f8ye8p,1582584449.0,"Hi. So I just wanted to tell you that I had something similar happen to me but I was taking viibryd. I felt better than I've ever felt on an antidepressant, but I was having these massive, incredibly intense panic attacks that would wake me up about 1-2 hours after falling asleep about every 6 weeks or so. Sometimes accompanied with some pretty disturbing dreams/sensations. Definitely the most terrifying thing that's ever happened to me. It started destroying my quality of sleep and went downhill after a couple occurrences. 

My Dr had absolutely no idea what was going on, but she suggested I start taking prazosin (off label for PTSD nightmares). She wasn't entirely convinced it was the viibryd, but I was certain it was since it's never happened before in my life until a month after I started that specific med. I wasn't interested in adding more to my daily med cocktail, so I opted to go off if it and it hasn't happened since.

Sometimes it's just the wrong med and you need to switch it up. Everyone's brain reacts differently to these types of drugs, so it's incredibly frustrating and I'm sorry it's happening. I was really down for awhile about finally finding an AD that worked but had that one stupid, debilitating side effect, I feel like I can understand where you're coming from. Good luck."

CPTSD,fid78cb,t3_f7ltjd,1582363579.0,"While this has happened to me at times in the past, I'm actually experiencing the other side of this. I have a co-worker that talks about her _hilarious_ dad and it is pretty clear to me that he's an abusive parent, but it is not so cleat to her...yet. Obviously, I can't say anything up-front bc I feel like she needs to come to that conclusion herself and it's not my business unless she initiates a conversation about it. But I do say things like, ""that's actually kinda mean"" when she says something especially horrific. It makes me shudder bc I feel like it's how others felt when I talked about my _hilarious_ mom in the past.

My freshman year of college, the first assignment in my speech class was kind of a icebreaker speech where we just talked about a specific aspect about ourselves. I talked about my sense of humor and how my parent's different senses of humor combined in me. I cringe so hard when I think about the couple stories I told about my mom....I thought it was just her humor, but it was actually just cruelty. I guess that's why no one laughed."
