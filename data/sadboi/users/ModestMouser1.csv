 Actually the person in question doesn't yell at anyone but if they ever did, I'm good at handling explosive episodes as I have people in my life that can be that way and it never gets to me as I know it has nothing to do with me. For their bpd, they withdraw , isolate themselves, shift moods from okay to depressed throughout the week and self-harm. They bottle everything up and when they explode,  isolates or injures themselves which kills me to see. 

I'll take your advice though and if we do ever get in a relationship, won't try and fix them and keep in mind that it's not my fault. I'll just support them as much as I can.  Thanks"

I'm currently the only friend they have and I would never purposely hurt them and have a lot of compassion so they never have to worry when with me but I can see how if I were toxic to them they'd stay. They seem to be able to accept abuse as normal behavior and that scares me to no end because I fear for their future and wonder if they aren't alone, will they end up with a manipulative and abusive person? There are plenty of hugely toxic people out there and if they end up with one of them, it will seriously break my heart because I love them and only want the best for them."
