I asked for advice, not a diagnosis."
LegalAdviceUK,f75u6kg,t1_f75sxaz,1573419143.0,"Thanks for the assessment of my mental health. It was the DVSA that advised me to careful and how it can be nerve wracking that he knows where we live. I never suggested murderer. But there's nothing to stop him coming to my house to try and talk to me or ""persuade"" me by whatever means to withdraw evidence or find out what I've said. That's intimidating enough without leaping to murder. 

I already see a doctor for anxiety. Please be very careful how you talk to a person with anxiety. We're not insane, and we don't need to be treated like we're leaping to conclusions when it's you that has made the leap.

Regardless, thanks for the rest of the advice."

I left school 12 years ago but I still have this dream every few weeks!"
FODMAPS,exuhgi5,t1_exug025,1566583836.0,Depends which ones you ate but the two crunchmasters rice crackers I saw have onion powder and garlic powder in. You need to eliminate onion and garlic 100% and it creeps into EVERYTHING :(
needadvice,ex3i9zd,t3_cr9ggd,1565985981.0,"If you don't have the grades to get where you want to be and don't want to compromise, you could always spend a year doing an Access to HE course first. That's what I did when my A-Levels were disappointing. It's basically the equivalent of A-Levels and catered more towards mature students but it was a great experience for me. I'm now finishing my PhD at a Russell Group university so it's 100% a valid option.

After doing A-Levels you'd find the Access course relatively easy, and it'd net you the UCAS points to get into most universities (except Oxbridge) if you do well."
