AmItheAsshole,fqkm4nq,t1_fqjqpz2,1589430397.0,"Your dad sounds a lot like mine. I even had a conversation with him, about how *yes* what other people do does have at least an initial impact on us even granting that we can decide on our reactions, and just poked him every ten or so seconds. This was in response to asking for other unpleasant behaviour to stop, for the sake of improved mental wellbeing.

Except no-one in my house has any authority and no grounding was done, and that aside this specific thing didn't piss my dad off all that much. Although, even when he got around to asking me to stop, he *still* wouldn't admit that people can have an impact on each other.

Since your dad sounds a lot like my dad, I'm going to say that at best you can expect some resurgence of behaviour even should you get through to him. I've changed to trying to develop different ways of positive interaction, which doesn't reduce unpleasant behaviour but still, it's nice knowing positive interaction is possible. You're not the one driving any type of negative interaction here, I just know how much it sucks to not have positive interactions with people you live with. (EDIT) After reading another comment of yours concerning other horrible stuff he's enabled, or sweeps under the rug, I should clarify you really are not responsible to foster any such positive interactions, it's all just a matter here of what's best for your wellbeing given the circumstances.

I really don't have any thing extra for you to try, to solve this issue. With people like this, it honestly is a case of choosing how to react . . . past the initial reaction that can't be helped and with fair acknowledgement that you don't have to be a saint. So, with acknowledgement that this does impact you and you're right to feel pissed off. And it's very unlikely to change.

You are right to feel pissed off, though, please do your best not to buy into anything that tends towards you being a prop in other peoples lives. Humans have emotions, expressing them is fine. Listening to emotions and trying to avoid harm is even better. And, if you're dad keeps insisting it does him harm not to hug you, keep in mind that if harm is impossible to avoid for one party, (1) this really isn't balanced because he tries guilting you into hugs which adds an extra harm and (2) if the harm is impossible, inaction should be the tendency. Like if one person likes music and one doesn't, playing music is not the natural state of affairs; It requires an action to be done, and doing harmful acts deliberately makes that party more responsible. And (3) there are higher moral considerations to consider than personal preference, like the fact that bodily autonomy is the foundation for safety, and not just a personal preference that people can choose to forgo."
AskReddit,fqfzha4,t1_fqfijhe,1589334802.0,"EDIT: The italic bit is the only thing that's actually direct reply, I just got invested in the topic overall.

I was replying at the end of the conversation, confusing, I guess, but I was referencing the quick reading via not subvocalizing or mentally sounding out the words. Which anybody can do, even having an inner narration that relies on linguistics doesn't mean reading isn't a particular type of activity. Shutting off that voice removes a type of storytelling aspect and gets it out of narrative form, and ought be easier to do because it's a directed and not, generally, an introspective activity; It distinctly takes one outside ones own head, which could feasibly turn off self-narration. As to sound, again, lots of people train themselves not to sub-vocalize. But this turns off one way of storing memory, i.e. as narrative instead of declarative.

I could be wrong, maybe people who have a whole linguistic and narrative and *heard* inner voice (and the VISQ really doesn't make a good distinction here, they sub factor some relevant stuff with not relevant stuff, I think, but maybe everyone with the linguistic thinking does hear it? Would make sense if they do go together for most, I tried forcing myself to think how they describe the condensation scale which best seems to map to having a full grammar for the linguistics, and the whole inner voice thing \[the dialogical scale really is where this is all a surprise to me, that's the bit I can't believe people do; and the evaluation scale is probably one that each type of thinker uses, just, *not* in linguistic form in our case. Or, if using it for strong enough negative self-evaluations which are socialized, maybe, I know that's where I get closest in my everyday life to thinking in full sentences. Or even, you know, primarily words\], and it is hard, and everything else aside their questions don't make sense because they only offer more or less correct grammar for the thinking, where-as the pointer-impression/referent that you said is so so much more accurate. Seriously. Seriously more accurate than them asking if people think in full or partial sentences when at least one point is that some people wouldn't think of their thinking as 'partial' sentences because they're literally something else.

But yeah, sub-vocalizing is a thing and so is declarative versus narrative memory. And not 'hearing' something removes a storytelling aspect, which, was the only point of the first comment. Even if it's quicker to read in that way, to the best one can, it might be a change for some people to recall that stuff. I kinda hope that those people *can* shut off the whole processing as words thing, even if I *do* get that narrative/heard/linguistic thinking can't be turned out. (Seriously, linguistic is probably the better term, I'm just confused how much people actually experience in general, but since most every can train themselves not to sub-vocalize, eh, the 'heard' thing might be able to be separated out, which was what was what suggesting those 90% of people do. *I never made a suggestion that the 10% 'learn' something better, I kinda just wrote for the 90% audience here who was surprised*. Narrative isn't such a good term because events can still be related to events in a structured way, and as regards stories one impresses themselves, developing a narrative, without, you know, being linguistic.) At least processing as distinct words. Can process things mainly as impressions and then have that as an internal referent. I mean, that last one sounds like memories, there's some common ground.

This is an interesting topic and I just read a bit on the VISQ thing since you posted, still trying to organize everything so sorry for however this comes across or this being too much, writing it down will help me remember the terms for something instead of, well, just recalling the phenomenon. Which, now that I think of it, my forgetting specific names for stuff probably has to do with not thinking linguistically either.

I really don't get how the whole 90% people side of things works, day-to-day. Except, funny enough, when having to have an actual conversation of if left alone to read fiction for a while I'll put effort into sub-vocalizing just to have a stronger narrative.

Other Edit because this is still frustrating: The first VISQ question: ""1. I think to myself in words using brief phrases and single words rather than full sentences."" And they only let you answer with a range from never to always. Which, never implies always thinking in full sentences and always implies thinking in fragmented sentences and there's no way to just say ""I don't get the question and why are their so many words involved in your definition of thinking?"""

It means something to have you at practices like that. It's good that you're going to ask the oldest what she thinks, and it's also worth framing it in the reverse, too, after a fashion, just to decrease the risk of putting anybody on the spot: Asking if she would have liked to do more things that required participation from the both of you, or with the support of you. Which, given you say your daughters are the 'look at this' types, would seem to be a yes. 

Even if you gave exactly equal amounts of attention, kids are all different from each other and low non-interactive/energy/chill whatever attention for the boys, while as meaningful as participatory or more one-on-one interaction with the girls, ideally about things they each like and with them getting the positive feedback of knowing their connecting with you on something you like instead of taking up time, well, require different amounts of energy so giving the same energy to each would mean interacting less or in less meaningful ways with the type that you don't connect with as much, or putting in more energy so that it can have the impact it needs for the different types of kids you have.

Speculation on some stuff, just trying to frame it from the perspective of someone who has different interest from their parents, and is also a younger daughter. It's still good that you'd just actually do the just asking thing required to get rid of the speculation stuff."

I know that people can do awful things due to being normal humans. Emotions cause a lot of volatile issues, on both the positive and negative side of things.

I know there's very little that makes someone deserve to die, and even less that makes them deserve to die by their own hand. I'd venture to say nothing fits in that last category. If they did something that harmed someone else, that someone else has the right to be made whole from that harm. That someone else doesn't have the right to harm in turn. If the harm is so bad that being made whole requires harming the person in turn, which again, I don't think can be the case, then there's still no conscionable way that can mean someone needs to harm *themselves.* I mean, even in the case of abusive partners, spreading that information is done so that other people can't be harmed, not to harm the abusive party.

As a youngest sibling, what this meant for me is that parenting--as in getting active help for stuff and that help being treated as normal--stopped at the same time for all of us. Not, as in, when we were all the same age; as in, it stopped the same year for each of us. So, more as is they got access to our parents attention until they were older than I was, and when my parents were done raising them I was expected to have everything sorted out as well. And they had the benefits of being adults when this actually happened.

I really don't doubt that there are situations as clear-cut as yours, or cases where the parents remember to provide parental help but on a different timeline, (and these two should be regarded separately, unfair treatment in comparison is shit, unfair treatment as par-the-course is also shit, and both are shit in unique ways)  I'm just going to say it's well worth keeping in mind that pretty much every sibling is going to have a different read on these types of situations."

Even if something bad were to happen, they might be happy at the prospect of stopping a bad person.

Of course, it's more like people who harm others have less than sound judgement or values of some type and will harm people based on opportunity instead of moral condemnation of their victim; But opportunity for predators doesn't mean moral failing on the victims part, since interacting with people just . . . creates opportunity for those people to harm you. Most people don't want to harm others though. And interacting with other people is just part of being human. Interacting with people creates many more opportunities than just that of potential harm.

Even when the baseline for life includes some less than pleasant stuff, it allows for the experience of things beyond itself. I mean, one thing that has nearly always broken through my depression has been reading, for exactly this reason. It gets you outside of your own head, and connects you with others.

I'd really divide this appreciating mortality into appreciating life and appreciating death, and see how differing appreciation's of the two match-up. Some happy-go-luck person might appreciate life but be completely thrown off by death for not appreciating what it really is, and that it can happen at any time. Someone who follows Buddhism might also do their best in experiencing life and not be thrown by death. Someone who only appreciates/understands death might commit suicide.

There's a lot of work being done in these claims by a different rendering of understands versus appreciates. I think that's happening in the sentence of yours I quoted, too. Some people can understand something but not appreciate it, however, if they simply have these differing reasons and valuations. Someone could fully understand what death is, not have many reasons for living, and still live because they don't appreciate or value death, or because they perfectly well understand they will die eventually anyway.

I'm not quite sure how to contrast them with what I've said about gangs, except the whole *zero-sum* nature of death involved in both groups because of the whole killing other groups thing. This leads to more willingness to kill than, presumably, mere exposure to death would.

Presumably.

I mean, here's something concerning, from *The role of nurses in AIDS care regarding voluntary euthanasia and assisted suicide: a call for further dialogue.*  ""Only 18% of Canadians feel that *nonvoluntary* 'mercy killing' should be treated like any other murder"" (2000, p. 513). For emphasis, although it is in the original: That's ***nonvoluntary.*** ~~So, uh, Doctors are better with lives being ended than I really hope the rest of the population is.~~ \[EDIT: So yeah, my bad, this stat is based on general population sampling. The only extra exposure to death involved in this is actively having to think about it, which is rather minimal to make any claims from.\] This is from 2000, but, support of euthanasia has only increased and the reasons for voluntary and non-voluntary are often conflated (i.e. it's acceptable not because a person requests it but because of what they're going through.)

Presumably they're only more accepting of voluntary euthanasia. One might hope.

Some of that 82% that is fine with it though is bound to simply support something akin to manslaughter. Still, it is less of a valuation of life than that valuation that all life is sacred."
AskReddit,fp5ql6e,t1_fp5pkp5,1588337555.0,"You'd think, but gangs are widely studied for how they do violate this expectation. The theory that matches yours are that people are threatened into joining gangs anyway, so there is a higher level preservation, and are threatened for position within their own gang when they show fear. So, a single gang enforces a fear of death for it's members. This is why they still act stupid even knowing it can happen to them, and that dead is dead, more than anyone who simply had a better concept of death than most would.

The ones that contradict it have to do with things like code-switching and gang culture, with how death and killing is joked about and thus, we could say, not properly understood. This also contradicts the theory I said. I think though, a lot of people would say that 'posers' are the people who this applies to, and that bona fide gang members will joke about killing somebody and kill somebody. Then return to the first paragraph of this about gangs as their own enforcement mechanism.

But then, any individual can differ and other psychological mechanisms can play a role. After you're pressed into a gang, sunk-cost fallacy can cause one to sincerely value it, despite (and in fact all the more for) the risk involved.

As to other groups exposed to death: I don't know as much about Doctors, I'd say because they're, duh, Doctors, they do work to preserve life. But . . . also a high suicide rate there, so, at some level understanding mortality and constantly being in that state of understanding must desensitize a person to it. That's all I do know about Doctors. I'd be interested to hear more, because gangs very much are the 'counter-intuitive' example."

I'm not debating them, I'm just saying plenty of people would make the case that religion is a masking of fear, and acceptance and 'living life to it's best' is a diversion from fear.

. . . also, getting out of the framework, and not being defined in relation to fear or denial would commonly be thought to be the purview of mental illness. That is, being disconnected enough from reality to not be impacted by it. This just voids the whole framework. (A lot of people would debate this and claim *any* neurosis is displacement of fear. In this case, making an internal diversion out of ones fear. Diversion and displacement are kinda interchangeable here, but displacement does imply less awareness of the initial cause.)"

AskReddit,fp5l917,t1_fp5hqaj,1588333274.0,"Here's an example. Gang members often have a better understanding of their mortality, which isn't what we'd expect from people putting their lives on the line if it's such a terrifying thing, but, mortality is truly a hard thing to deny the more it's a constant in your life. This is exactly why it is terrifying; it's inescapable. So, these people will do whole life-or-death fights more often, esp. with other people they know understand that threatening a life is a true threat, so, even stupid things get fought over.

On the other hand, accountants, say, and white collar people. There's certainly more of an attempt to talk things through and negotiate. The fear isn't as real for them, and things are actually less likely to be life-or-death. But, hey, anybody might try killing somebody to keep themselves out of jail. This is why we don't want to punish any crime that is bettered by a witness more than we punish murder itself. There always needs to be an additional risk to murdering a person.

To put it better, this fear *and* denial keep people civil. The fear makes people do more murderous things, on it's own, and the denial on it's own . . . I suppose that's being blissfully unaware, OR directing the fear towards life-preserving efforts like offspring or legacies."

depression,fon7tmn,t1_fomyrav,1587914108.0,"I honestly wanted to repeat it as many times as I could. There are different ways of conflict resolution that don't, you know, make one party ashamed as a matter of course.

I guess, an example, it is fine for your mom to be frustrated. It isn't fine of her to prolong fighting that negatively impacts everybody. Or, more clearly, in a *way* that negatively impacts everybody, since is actually fine to have disagreements. Voices quiet, something over text, whatnot, while you're not there, all that would be potentially fine. (I say potentially because it really sounds like they have some contempt going on, which is . . . not a good thing in relationships.) Making a request and having someone say no, and pushing it, makes a lot of people feel bad. Making a request that you know somebody will be uncomfortable with, even when not pushing it, does the same. Both the 'right' and the 'wrong' party can of course make requests, and can feel bad. But if someones not trying to understand why the other party is saying no, or what they might be comfortable with, they're also in the wrong with how they're treating each other during the disagreement. That's railroading. If you can't even say how you feel, somethings wrong, and not with you. Feelings are a sign you're another living autonomous person, they're not attacks on somebody else, unless that person wants you to feel a certain way and *doesn't even care how you feel about that,* which is another level of ironic.

It's also fine to have boundaries on how you help people, even in the case you do want to help them. A timer nearly (ongoing issues) worked for solving family fights, at least between my dad and I, since no one talked during anyone else's turn and turns were short enough no one felt railroaded. (This was on my suggestion as an adult, I'm proud of my dad for trying, and tbh the pure humour value in using a timer made us more relaxed and helped in realizing were on the same side of helping each other. ***Even if we disagree, the point is to help each other understand where we're coming from.*** I can't say anyone else in my family, bar my oldest brother, has actually realized that. Seriously, adults model conflict resolution.

I mean, frustration honestly doesn't even *need* to lead to fighting. I guess some people will say ""people fight when they're frustrated"" and point out like I did that people react to stuff. Yeah, people do fight when frustrated. Do they ever not fight, do they ever talk before getting frustrated, do they ever clearly communicated errors afterwards? Because people shouldn't be fighting all the time, and if one party isn't trying to diminish fights (btw, you are trying to because changing your own behaviour to avoid fights is pretty much all you can do when other people aren't listening to you. I already did say why not getting involved is perfectly fine, in fact, it's unfair to expect otherwise.) and it's at that level, it's a problem. There always needs to be some way to address issues in a relationship.

Anyway, I just went really general on account of these considerations being tied more to method than to content, but I hope that you can re-contextualize them. And honestly, it bears repeating that having emotions is not selfish. Reacting to them isn't. Not letting somebody else express emotions is, and reacting in a way that encourages the same is. Reacting to *that* to try to get the space to express your own feelings is not selfish. And when two people have irreconcilable emotions on something? That's a thing, that means choosing to drop a subject, interact less, not date somebody, focus on something else; It doesn't mean one parties selfish for having their own emotions.

Of course, you add the whole *context* bit back into these general outlines at some point, and it's clear that there can actually be wrong and right parties, but the point holds that e*ven if we disagree, the point is to help each other understand where we're coming from.* Insisting on rightness or wrongness without explanation is not helpful. (This is also why it can be so difficult in abusive situations, wanting to be right and keeping on engaging with somebody; Not wrong, but, not productive. I find broken households to count as abusive situations, mayhap not implying abusive people, but heck do I know how frustrating they can be and it really does play with stress, in a way similar to abuse at a young age, as well. Stress impacts the brain really directly. The brain only has so many states, and then context tells people to regard these states certain ways. But when the two mismatch, say by knowledge informing us it's other people fighting, that does not mean the physical response literally goes away. Of course you're stressed; When people are loud that means danger of some form! It's not selfish to limit your exposure to that type of stimulus.

(Funny story, my older brother once clicked start on an online exam while I was reviewing for it. There was a what the fuck moment at that from me, him apologizing, and him on page flipping duty for the textbook. We both quickly skipped over the fighting bit to not fail the exam. Because we were on the same team on something. Namely, a timed exam.)"
depression,fomxijt,t3_g8ducm,1587906848.0,">I know it’s selfish that I am thinking about my own feelings

Who told you that? It's selfish for a parent to involve their child, of any age, in marital disputes. And, this has been going on for ten years, or at least a few, and definitely long enough for you to realize slagging off to your moms once and future partner isn't the best idea.

Honestly, I had a mini-something after one such fight between my parents, not about breaking up, because they never consider it (they maybe should) and emailed a professor something I am def. not going to reread jut about how I couldn't focus or get the work done because of people in my house yelling, can I please have an extension? That was not for a full Ph.D proposal, but was grad level. It . . . did not make me feel better, but the extension bit helped me relax, if just from needing to get it done at a personally agreed to time thanks to shame. Sharing to say that I understand.

I don't have the best short term solutions, I know for me trying to relax just made me feel like I needed my actions still to concede to what was going on and it didn't really decrease stress (or increase work, which certainly increased stress.) But longterm, I mean, my parents are like trains on a track with the less than sane stuff they do. Recognizing that, esp. in the moment, has made the situation seem less particular and I kinda just mentally observe now and laugh, also mentally. There's a relief in putting in less effort trying to change them. I get less hurt when we don't do planned stuff together, or just plain don't plan stuff. I did need a support network broader than my parents to get to that stage. I guess, I can only even get into this mindset because I realize parents have special obligations, and them failing at it isn't a failure on my part. Even if it meant we all sometimes yelled at each other--people, parents more than any other, model conflict resolution behaviour.

Like thinking you need to take sides. For normal conflicts, and not abusive ones, you don't need to. (For abusive ones it can re-victimize someone to stay neutral.) But even in abusive cases taking sides doesn't mean harping on an abuser-it means supporting the victim. Talking to them and telling them it's fine to have the full range of human responses esp. to situations that are high intensity and just ask for a response. In your case, you're allowed to feel pressured, and react to that feeling by taking time to yourself. It's not selfish. Also, thinking about your own feelings is never selfish, how you act on them can potentially be, but thinking about them never is. People have quick reactions all the time, and, really important tip, trying to suppress reactions or thoughts intensifies them. This is just a wider tip for depression: if you can't avoid taking time depressurize, of which you should always have some anyway, at least make sure you don't feel bad about it. That's . . . not really time to depressurize, and you really should always have some."

You and those people both have reason to complain.

Seriously, you have a good reason to complain, even I've been somewhat bitter at an online comic for making their works available because of Covid, when normally people with depression have very little available to them courtesy just being ignored. But, it's better that they do something, I can't complain about people finally being decent to each other. Potential homelessness is certainly more objectively complaint worthy than that little example.

Without any of the mitigating factors that would have changed the overall risk to their mental health, which they are acutely aware of. This is bad all around.

And kudos on you for *not* calling them that, even as frustrated as you are. I mean, who cares if I'm happy with you not being happy? My point literally is that that's a messed up standard. You're not exactly fine right now, but, clearly that's in more ways than one (I know the feeling since I had to start aiming for content instead of happy at some point because happy just hasn't been a thing for a while) and  I'm not sure why your situation can't have you frustrated and expressing it, barring that somebody else is doing the same and this might cause them frustration. But you both matter.

Frustrated, sure, annoyed, like you said, and humans tend towards reactions to lives events . . . kinda inbuilt in the being human thing, it doesn't make you pathetic.

You don't really have to acknowledge my personal perspective, I get it's not the most agreeable thing and literally can't solve for when two people are frustrated in different directions about the same thing, like say, Covid, say literally right now, mainly typed all this to go contra the whole negative begetting negative thing, because I can't really stomach personal insults on these subs. It took me too much extra content to really explain that, but I hope I have, and I hope you don't take personal insults to heart.

This was also discussed and I still felt this all was a useful external benchmark. Right, this rambling has a point, namely that external benchmarks are so useful in letting yourself know you're doing what you can, but, please know even paying attention to your mental health is doing something. *Anyway,* my person to talk to was laid off by that point, no reason to take it personally.) At first I didn't mind because I just found a great phone app. to do to-do lists *AND* was using it, now it's because the things on the list are mostly unfeasible, which is where covid comes in. I was doing the walks thing to and I miss the fuck out of it, but mind, I got depressed doing them last year what with winter being a thing and realizing I couldn't keep it up.

I'm with my family, but, that only means parents, they . . . hmm, I told them last week/or within the last two weeks, that I was feeling really depressed and nearly begged to do something each day. (Accurately, offered if they want to spend any quality time together, that we can, not that I wanted to do something each day or expected that just that I kept asking about as long as I could stomach to.) Next to nothing has come from that. Now I'm spending far too much time  just tired and in bed. So, I miss mine too, just, for different reasons. But, writing this out, it was just next to nothing, not literally nothing (very, very near) so I guess I'll try again.

To not be so miserly for a second (not that it's a problem to be just that sometimes, I just personally don't want to be miserly 100% when talking to another person having difficulties) this is just a stark fucking reminder of how much circumstances matter, how we're all human and react, and that, survivorship bias being allowed for a moment, things will get better after this. Positive things can affect you just as much as the negative, and you, well, you are capable of managing your depression, in that there's nothing you're contributing to this situation to make it worse, and in fact, you know that circumstances allowing you do things to make it better. (I used to volunteer in a hospital but had to hope out a while back after about a year because I missed shifts. With calling, because of *feeling* sick, probably just stress. While I did other things to get qualifications so I'm not dissing myself here, holy heck you went and became a nurse, a mentally and *emotionally* draining thing, while at a disadvantage. Good job. People deserve people helping them.)

I hope this wasn't too much commiserating, just . . . tired, is all. I wish I could be doing something more to get out. But last year I caught the flu, caught likely bronchitis (Dr. never called it that, did treat it like that, point being has impacted my breathing, she heard fluid, tonsils weren't happy, and actually I was *supposed to go back actually* given the next points), caught a cough from that, still have cough from that; so I should probably do my best to avoid getting covid right now. I wish I could volunteer or something, even get a job (like I was trying to do before this) and just be part of the 'herd' because I'm young but . . . yeah just consider it sharing covid fears, I should damn well avoid the thing. Trying to figure out when is best to go to the medical office has had me thinking when they announce the lift of shelter in place--a week or two before that date, so people are bunkered down for the last stretch. And I don't catch a flood of people who did wait it out. That seems like too long. I'm thankful people like you and many others are taking all the precautions needed to make a lockdown work.

I never ramble like this in replies, but I'm usual replying on suicide watch sub, to help others, this is my first time trying commiserating. Mainly because I personally relate to where you're at, but also because you seem like a good person, being aware of your loved ones health. Please know you can only do what's in your power, and you doing that means passing it on would not be your fault. (Not that it wouldn't still be a serious thing to have happen.)"

AskReddit,fo8uzcs,t1_fo7p4z1,1587604394.0,">There has to be a time when these lawyers realise this is a problem!!

Not a lawyer, but you'd think. I'd like to offer my perspective on this, because it's a real effort to figure out why people you know know better, don't do better.

They realize it's a problem, but *how do they relate to it*?  Like, how many people donate, how many people know what to do if they see a person being verbally abused in public, how many people even facebook share organizations that are meant to help?

Most everyone realizes these things are problems, but, they're not their problem, or, they're not equipped to deal with it, or they're tired, or they have some other ongoing problem, or they think the problem is better handled elsewhere. Or, they prioritize something else more, or they think it might be nice to help but not bad not to, so morals might not enter, even on a traditionally moral issue. I can *easily* see a case for ""the damage being done"", which kinda seems counter to the law addressing already committed crimes, but with something like sexual abuse where we all get to hear how it's life altering all the time (insert separate rant here about dehumanization), people may be intimidated or burnt out to do anything to address it, because they feel like it's too late. Even if they don't care that much, if they realize what an effort and a good thing it would be for them to do something, they can then ask why it's required of them, and all these biases come into play.

It mainly boils down to sincerely not caring, or being a bystander. If you get too tired to deal with a case once, and it's still on your plate, and you do less than you should (than you feel you should, which in some cases might mean simply taking a case for a type of person you wouldn't want to defend) and if you do better next time, heck, that makes it worse that you didn't do anything last time, because it tells you you could have.

I mean, I do know your comment was less a question of how people can't see the problem than confusion that people are like that, but still, interesting topic."
AskReddit,fo1x5sk,t1_fo1sxkd,1587443608.0,"I lean towards your side on this, esp. the access and common sense part, anyone can look up anything about childhood sexual abuse for a source on this. Not having saved a (particularly interesting) source I can only say that my sticking point for not being on your side at the base facts is that people who sexually assault children are the group most likely to just . . . sexually assault people, point blank. There's a degree to which pedophilia is a predictor of assault, but there's a very real degree to which something akin to objectification is also a predictor, independent from that.

Even if you don't agree with this sourceless (I really do assure you there's a source and I'm not misrepresenting it) thought, there's still a point where people's sexuality mets the barriers against abuse and those barriers fail, else there wouldn't be abuse. This is true of any sexuality.

My point is: fine, sexuality isn't something realistically able to be changed at any large scale, and changing it then can never be as much a solution as, say, prison, parole, registries, and the like. But, if it can't change . . . then people with pedophilia and/or objectification urges (I do think and/or is the case, because for some people the barriers aren't even an issue, see, objectification urges, for some people, something overcomes them, like with pedophilia and there being no way to act on that bar assault) will *still* overcome the 'barrier' of castration. They'll assault kids by other means. It's not uncommon. Do we cut off their fingers next? This is why prison does work better than alternatives. People chemically castrated don't become asexual. Speaking as an asexual person with a libido, there's more to it than that. This is why people will take viagra or the like when their libido drops; because their sexuality is still in play.

So castration, even if you believe it's deserved, (I personally think no-ones opinion on this could be wrong, some people aren't fine with violence, some people are, and this is a crime for which no punishment is commensurable--except one, and please, let's not say rapists should be raped, the whole point is that it's wrong (not saying you are, just being exhaustive here)--is not useful. Shortening that: Castration, deserved or not, is not useful. Anyone who would willingly do it is placing barriers on their way to acting out whatever urge they have, and thus, we can be assured that their barriers are firm enough to prevent assault as well as can ever be expected. (Or, to be exhaustive again, they're trying to play up the idea that it's a solution to regain access to kids, still good to get rid of the idea that it's a solution.) Anyone who wouldn't willingly undergo it will find another way.

EDIT: Reading further down, to anyone saying he has no source on the access point.

If you're not fine with your permission being needless, instead of just assumed, you're not fine with unsolicited pics.

They will help with clarifying what you'd like, and reflecting your thoughts back to you after giving you a chance to talk, which can actually be quite useful.

They can also help you with finding other resources for better longterm support, but in general they might aim towards reducing risk by addressing and picking one topic, because they can only do so much on one call and can't just connect you to the same person because of privacy concerns and the like.

She should have been listening, that she didn't is inexcusable esp. with her actively trying to shame you for something you have no need to feel ashamed over.

That there says a lot. There's a way of living that isn't living. This is not, kinda self-evidently, a positive way to live. One website/resource compared suicide to jumping out of a burning building, and it stuck with me; It's more that people don't want to be in pain than that they want to die, however, the extent to which they see the pain changing (or the building being on fire) without jumping is what makes suicide the option. If there are firemen, that could be useful. If there's water, that's useful, and so on.

You really seem like you want to have a future, to live, and not seeing a future life for yourself is taking that desire away because . . . desires that you can't place anywhere or act on can freaking hurt.

I have negative self thoughts from minor trauma's, mainly being yelled at as a kid, and I get the feeling of wanting noise to stop. The volume on those thoughts really, sometimes it doesn't matter, just that they're not that easy to control. Not something you've decided to think. I know one thing that helped me before, was writing down each specific negative thought and a counter thought, as they came up, not as a way to stay positive, but, just using an additional negative voice to berate the creativity so that each thought could only come across once and be given consideration, before the much easier critique of not being creative displaced it. This worked because I didn't need to get rid of the guilt to ignore the thoughts. Sometimes it is minor things that can help, in utter lack of proportion to the problem that they're helping with. I hope you get something like that. You quite honestly deserve it.

I really do mean every word I said, if I could give you all my belief that they were true, I would. All I can do is say it again. You were a victim. You don't deserve to be blamed for what you were a victim of, in any way, shape, or form. From anybody, for any reason. Even if you were older when this had all happened, there are so many posts even here about people respecting another's choices on who to disclose what to, that there's no promise you would have known what to do even if you did try disclosing to others, or that they would have been clear. 

There's no way to know they would have followed up properly or helped, either, if you did. I get that the only way they could've followed up was if somebody told them, but there's a reason rape is the least prosecuted crime, and it has to do with who does it to who, mainly. With people not intervening with others family, or not discussing how family can be the ones that hurt you, and it's not your fault that you needed to learn about these things before knowing what to do. It's good that you can reflect, now, on what ought to have been done, but it's horrible that there was no single person around who was an adult, who did have the resources, who at the time ought to have done the right thing, that you believe that you ought to have had that responsibility. 

Maybe this will make sense. With that shouting I mentioned earlier, my mom always stopped me replying, even talking, by saying how embarrassed the neighbours would be. I know shouting pretty much at all is wrong, now, as an adult. I also recognize that when I was a kid, shouting because no one will let you talk . . . isn't unforgivable. Is maybe even what's to be expected of a kid, esp. when shouting is modelled for them. As a kid, thought, I felt it was unforgivable. Realizing as an adult that kids really shouldn't have those expectations on them, to be anything but kids, is vastly important. As an adult, as well, I went through a phase of being angry no adult who undoubtedly did hear shouting, called the cops. They ought to have. I ought to not have been embarrassed that it was a possibility. It should have occurred to me that if the household was that loud, it probably wasn't the best place to leave unchecked. But . . . do I hold myself responsible for not realizing that sooner? Heck no, because not realizing sooner was part of the issue. Silence around rape is part of that problems issue. There are steps to realizing what to do, which is why resources and awareness matter so much. You are not responsible for not knowing what to do when nobody, specifically those people who had a responsibility to teach you, taught you anything. Those people ought to have done better. All the adults ought to have done better at being open with kids so that they can notice these things. Also, the only person really freaking responsible for the 'issue', instead of just for fixing it, is the person who decided to rape somebody else. Clearly differing levels of responsibility, there. You are clearly, not ever as responsible as he was for what happened; You're also more clearly able to recognize other people's pain, which carries with it wanting to do something, but recognizing pain does not make you responsible for it, as a kid you shouldn't need to parent anybody. 

Think of siblings who grow up in abusive households; Doesn't it hurt to know the older siblings often blame themselves? Your situation isn't all that different except you had more misinformation and less resources to intervene with.

This, I think, usually I apologize for the length of all this. But this time, I really just want to say, I hope some of these beliefs can transfer over to you and I hope you know this is nowhere near enough to explain how much you are not to blame. No where near enough words, nowhere near enough time, just nowhere near the acknowledgement you actually deserve."

Which, yes, doesn't solve that you do care and her safety is at risk.

Other options: Can't get her to talk about mental health, get her talking about anything else. Can't get her talking, talk to her. Obviously, nothing that makes her feel more isolated.

I can't imagine how difficult this must be, when the options keep getting more limited. Can you get her to call you before she does anything? At least, then you'd have the choice to call somebody (police) based on what you'd know of a more immediate situation. You can't make the wrong call here, or one that people can judge you for, I suppose I should say. Actually, on the topic of making that choice: This sounds longterm for her.

I mean, think of the people who fought against slavery, there.

The second one is: People are both good and bad. Not in some wish-y wash-y way about how they all have the capability and hey, that must mean we're all secretly good. But, in the way that if somebody has fucked thoughts and we'd never know, we'd never know, and are they a  bad person? Are you bad for judging others when I'm pretty sure you're at least applying consistent criteria and are somewhat dissatisfied with how everyone goes into boxes in some ways that deform them? Likely not. That drives that want to be better, to not stereotype people, or yourself, and it's what makes possibilities realizable.

It's also hard not to be egocentric when people aren't open about their private lives any, or inner thoughts, or just rehash social media. That's wanting more of people, and not finding it. And adapting. Would you ever deliberately choose to harm someone for the sole reason that you could? I really don't think so.

Anyway, I'm happy to discuss more or add details, I'm just wanting to see what your reply is first. I do think a lot of this links to depression because at this modern stage we can't see how the world could get better, and the world sucks some, and people often fit their environment.

As to anything more daily than kinda the things I mentioned, or just people being shitty in daily life: Do any of us focus on other people that much, or put enough stock in each of them, that even one decent person doesn't counteract that. I think, maybe to put it another way, we recognize how other people have a life to live, so daily ignorances don't get weighted as high. I'm trying to say that sometimes, even when people aren't good, they're not bad.

Also, I should clarify, I guess for certain people none of these will apply, and I'm not trying to 'win' a debate, I'm just . . . trying to add a few hopefully more reasonable points to people being just people, and that being enough, that you can have better access to thinking better about them, like you want. So, there's no need to agree or feel worse for not agreeing, because the point is that *you,* as you are, feel somewhat better. If you decide I can help with that by chatting, then please let me know, if you decide I can't, I really hope that you can appreciate the attempt."

SuicideWatch,fln50vn,t1_fln30le,1585309319.0,"I guess, I ask because I know helping out makes me feel not only objectively like I've done something, but it makes me personally feel more worthwhile, if that makes sense. Like, other things might still be progress but rarely feel meaningful, not that that should always matter because individuals are worth more than what they can do for others. So, it makes me feel less depressed. At least, I mean, in the moment, and it gives me a reply to all the negative thoughts I have.

So I guess I'm asking if there's things that make you feel better to balance out things that have you wanting to die. Or, if you'd like to talk about those last things directly, that'd be good to. This world needs more empathetic people. Also, good job on the good deed you did, and even now your clear discretion on what it was. Empathetic and sensible, so far, just what I can see from talking to you."
SuicideWatch,flmf4is,t1_flgld34,1585281916.0,"So, I started with, ""Nearly Forgot My Broken Heart"", and can I just say that I appreciate this combination of tempo and (clear) vocals. It can be pretty hard to find, and somehow the vocals remind me of country music and the tempo, not so much, but it's just *good*.

Still listening, probably gonna chime in more. But I have to start with recommending ""One Tin Solider"", old, yes, but . . . it has tempo to it. Uh, don't know the artists, it's the only song I listen to by her. Another old one, ""The Mercy Seat"" by Nick Cave & . . . that's enough info to google, kinda a higher tempo and a weird start, but I like songs that cover social issues.

Moving on to ""The Promise"" I don't know, lyrically, I'm reminded of September Stories, I might suggest googling their lyrics and picking a song that way. Honestly, truly relaxing music like Chris isn't my norm, so I'd actually suggest ""The Shape of the Earth"" I'd start with automatic weaponry. And ""Romantics"". I can't actually find the last song by them I'd like to suggest, it's from a different album, but uh, I guess that means go with whatever you can find.

Last recommendation, try different songs from different albums by ""mewithoutyou"" they're religious but, eh, also doubtful, and anxiety is something I think we can all relate to. Some of their lyrics are meant to be really amorphous or only meaningful to them, but I like that on some of the faster songs because you get to attach your own meanings to it while still getting an idea of the feeling behind everything. Some of their songs can keep pace with my anxiety, and help me get out of it. All of their albums however, are nearly like they're from different people, so give each a try. Sad they finished their last album recently.

Lastly, let me know what you think. And remember, things like music exist and nobody gets to decide how much they mean for others, just themselves, and nobody should get to decide what you mean, either, except you. Also, even if you don't feel you mean much, there's still so much to participate in that other people would be more than happy to have you for. Example: I was stressed today before listening to music, it was relaxing, and I'm looking forward to any reply you might have and/or other people to listen to."
SuicideWatch,flmde3f,t1_fljq8wq,1585280611.0,"How do you feel about accomplishing something or helping people while not dying during the process? I'm also wondering, overall, why that's not on the table. Honestly, there's a lot of posts that amount to wanting to trade cancer with somebody, even before coronavirus, but very few about point blank wanting to get cancer. I'm not sure how much of it is empathy for difficult situations that can develop from being depressed, or how much of it is people who are depressed needing to find worth elsewhere, so I'll just tell you, whichever it is, it's empathetic to even find helping others to be worthwhile and you seem like a decent person."
SuicideWatch,flmd5we,t1_flk8ttt,1585280443.0,"I only know that right now, anybody and nearly everybody is in a negative place with jobs and/or finances. If circumstances can lead to a bad life, they can also lead to a good life. If they can't, then that's massively unbalanced and unfair. Obviously, you know your situation better than I do, or can, so may I ask why it would be impossible for you to get a job sometime in the future? I mean, I feel the same way myself, I have very little job experience, and it feels hopeless, and the effort needed and changes it would bring make it feel impossible, but at the same time, it's that's the feeling which doesn't always match up to reality.

Anyway, I'm not trying to make you feel bad or argue with you, I hope you know that's not my intention. I just hope something could, well, give you hope. Even as frightening as that itself often is."
SuicideWatch,fljtzm4,t1_flip7di,1585226488.0,"My job search before all this was unsuccessful, I'd honestly say that the thought has crossed my mind that at least my employment gap won't be as noticeable given the current situation. Maybe. I do want you to know that everything your describing, none of it is your fault. More than that, you've put in effort to fixing it which does show how you could do in the right circumstances. I really don't know what the hiring situation will be like after this, I am aware enough to know that right now, it's not the best. 

As somebody who feels the emotional impact everyday from being dependent on others, I can say I appreciate not your not wanting people to live in misery from poverty and unemployment. Despite that all, I personally still want to live. I mean, better if I could be someone else, no doubts there, but being me is necessary to anything I'd like to experience. That note, do you'd like to experience (I mean, even this, suicide as a way out isn't something it sounds like you, or most anybody, wants for the experience of it.)"
