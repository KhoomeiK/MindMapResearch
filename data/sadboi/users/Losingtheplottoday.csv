You are who you are. Accept and love yourself, because if you cant accept and love yourself...how do you expect others to? 

So if the woman you see on instagram has a perfect body. Fantastic for her. Be happy for her. If that is how you would like your shape to be, focus on ways you can achieve a similar look. Dont kick yourself down because you dont already have that look. Dont kick the person because theyve achieved what you havent. Pull your focus into how you can achieve what you want.

She said the news said facemasks do not help and so people shouldn't wear them. I said surely they have to be better than not wearing one. Just the fact hospital and dental staff wear them for protection for themselves and others...before this virus makes me think theyd be more helpful than not.

Social services got involved and the social worker didnt even believe me. 

After years, and lots of therapy I realised I was never going to get the closure I needed so I accepted that I knew the truth and I didnt need it validated. If they couldnt admit to it, they were obviously suffering shame and denial out of guilt.

Your mom obviously has some issue going on, because no one would choose to continue living that way. 

I hope you manage to get the help you need and I am sorry about your job. It's understandable that depression is starting to hit you. 

I dont think any approach to your mother is going to help tbh, I think her head is buried."
BPD,fdf7ubm,t1_fdf4cb7,1578355323.0,"Is this directed to me, or the OP?"
BPD,fdf7g71,t1_fdf6h3e,1578355063.0,"Understandable. I'd be feeling the same as you. 
I wasnt pinning it all on you by the way, I was just giving her possible perspective since I know how it's hard to see from another perspective sometimes.

Maybe this has all worked out for the best, because like you say if you go through with it you are moving quite a distance away with someone who doesnt seem like they will be a great support in times of need. It seems like now is a time you could really do with some support too. 
 
If you are as close as you say, youd think she would know of your anxiety and would pre warn you about her crush coming along too. 

Maybe get yourself back on your feet and then reassess the situation. Maybe in a month or two you could join her. 

Good luck with whatever you decide :)"
BPD,fdf6d5r,t3_el1x13,1578354336.0,"I've wondered this about myself. I asked my therapist but she flat out said no. Which I found odd because there are so many similarities between bpd and autism I dont know how she could just outright say no without actually looking into it further. 

I dont even fully fit the criteria to be fully diagnosed as bpd, just traits. 

Is there a different way to go to check out autism or is it through the mental health team still?"
BPD,fdf5iik,t3_el2bw2,1578353778.0,"Well from her point of view it could be that she is completely drained and didnt have it in her to be there for you. 

Then from her point of view again, it could look like you're no longer going with her as a way to punish her for not being there for you. 


I think your emotions are running the show here and I think if you really wanted to go before all of this, then you should still just go. Otherwise you're shitting on yourself for nothing. She wanted a day to herself, and that is okay."
BPD,fdf4o5v,t3_el1zad,1578353226.0,"I worried about who I would be without this mental illness. It took me a long ass time to accept myself for who I am, so would I have to start that process again if I was better? 
So I guess it's the same thing really. In a way. 

What I can say though, is that I have worked on myself through therapy and even medication at times. I havent changed as a person and my likes and dislikes haven't changed, either (no more than usual anyway). The thing that has changed is how well I can handle myself. How well I can deal with my moods. I am able to navigate my way through problems better than I once could. 

Through all of that I realised that I am who I am with or without the mental illness. I'm still me. I'm not my bpd, and so no matter how much better I get, I'm not going to change my view on myself because I like myself as a person. 

Just like you like your SO as a person. Improving yourself isnt going to change that. But I do completely understand why you would be questioning that."
BPD,fdeqg8j,t3_el04y4,1578344466.0,"You're right. It's not your fault, or responsibility.
If he is wanting to be homeless, die and hurt people, then what hope have you actually got if you do offer him help and support? 
It doesnt sound like he wants to help himself."
BPD,fdc2x6x,t3_ekjw7i,1578266036.0,Yup. I'm just plodding along the best I can hoping that my time comes sooner rather than later. Being one of those that die of natural causes in old age sounds like hell to me.
BPD,fdasgk8,t1_fd90s21,1578249517.0,I'm sorry to hear that. It might be hard but you will get through it.
BPD,fd61cko,t3_ek3d2i,1578184170.0,"I dont think social media and bpd go well together. It's just a giant selection box of triggers sitting at our finger tips. We never know what is going to bother us, but something always does. 

I can honestly say that my anxiety has decreased since I'm no longer on facebook. 
When I was on it I was too afraid to post worrying that I was saying something stupid and being judged. I found it next to impossible to respond to people if they did comment or message me, again out of fear of being judged as stupid. I couldn't hold a conversation down for the same reasons and it caused me so much stress. 
I'd stress and worry about not being able to respond, so it was a constant lose loss situation."
BPD,fd4mlxe,t3_ejx0jw,1578168941.0,"I think even a normal person would struggle to deal with the scenario you're dealing with here. 

Your boyfriend is unable to text you back until 5am because he has been out all night with his ex girlfriend. You feel insecure about this, as many people would and his response is to block you! 

Maybe talk to him, explain your insecurities and see if you can both come up with a way to help reassure you. 
Going on dates with exes is just adding fuel to the fire."
BPD,fd4dnen,t1_fd2lzyg,1578166648.0,Thank you!
BPD,fd1xktk,t3_ejudyf,1578138395.0,"Reverse the roles for a second. 

How would you feel if your boyfriend threw away your personal belongings? 

How would you then feel if when you were upset, he started begging you to say you loved him? 

How would you then feel if because you couldnt say you loved him because you're far too angry at the fact he threw away your stuff, he harmed himself? 

Basically you have thrown away his stuff, and instead of allowing him to be upset and you apologising for your wrong doing, you're expecting him to be cool and calm and tell you he loves you. Because he isnt doing what you want, you've harmed yourself. 

This is extremely unhealthy for both of you. 

What led to you impulsively throwing his stuff away?"
BPD,fd1wcwt,t3_ejtug3,1578137839.0,"Chances are it would have bothered you no matter which way you found out. 

Accept it for what it is, cope with this the best you can and move on. 

It's pretty obvious why he keeps exes as friends though. It wont be long until hes calling on you and cheating on his current girlfriend with you. When they break up, you will be there as back up. No doubt that's what he thinks."
BPD,fczknws,t3_ejpave,1578103318.0,"I deal with whatever is affecting me the most. 
With me, my anxiety is my biggest issue mostly so I keep a check on that and take meds if and when needed. 

At the minute, depression is starting to rear its ugly head and so I've made an appointment with my GP to see about getting some therapy/meds. 

My bpd just makes my moods difficult and hard to follow since I can fluctuate so much throughout the day, but by being aware I can know which one is actually becoming an issue that needs dealt with. 
I knew depression was coming because I've been quite impulsive recently and my moods are dipping deeper than the usual dips. 

Just don't be afraid or ashamed to ask for help if and when you feel you need it. I try to act and ask for help before I get out of hand. Hence why I've made this appointment before depression has got a hold of me fully."
BPD,fczjjk5,t3_ejpjph,1578102625.0,My diagnosis was downgraded to eupd traits after months of therapy. I think my biggest thing that got me downgraded was not being in a relationship anymore. I think I'd be given the full diagnosis again if I entered another one lol
mentalhealth,fczgx4h,t3_ejnjav,1578101001.0,"You could always contact the crisis team and explain that you are seriously concerned about her well being. 

I am in the UK too and I was concerned about an ex friend of mine (schizophrenia too) who was clearly suffering extreme paranoia judging by his Facebook posts. He has no family in the area or many friends.  I spoke to my therapist about it and she said she would look into it. She told me that in the future if I am concerned again that I can just call the crisis team. 

A week or two later he was posting about the doctors calling and insisting they see him. so I'm  guessing my concern worked. His posts settled down after that."
BPD,fczf22u,t3_ejowx9,1578099807.0,"I'm sure she will come around and her saying she isn't in love with you anymore is probably just the hurt talking. 

You dont need to explain anything to her. You were trying to protect her. 
You did the right thing. No matter what the end result of all of this is, you most definitely did the right thing."
BPD,fcz3nwf,t3_ejnftk,1578093009.0,So just continue working on yourself as if you did still have the diagnosis of bpd. All she has done is taken it off a piece of paper.
BPD,fcyho1f,t3_ejjk91,1578080330.0,"You know she gets distant when she is stressed or tired. You've already asked her if all is okay and she has said yes. You've facetime with her and all seemed fine. She is still texting. 

Now...you know she has got annoyed at you in the past when you've kept asking if things were okay and it was other things going on in her life causing the distance. So...remember all of that. Dont ask her again. Take her word for it, otherwise you're adding more stress to an already stressed person. Allow her to be stressed, and be there for her instead of going in to yourself if that makes sense. 

It will be hard but you can do it."
BPD,fcv6pao,t3_ej2fev,1577995773.0,"What you have to remember is that this feeling is very very very common  when we start dating. We perceive any tiny change as a feeling of them detaching or leaving. 

His lack of responses could be that he isnt that big of a texter to begin with and feels comfortable enough with how you two are for him to not be chasing as much. 

Unless his behaviour towards you and around you has changed, I'd take it as nothing more than him just not being as into texting as he was to begin with. For the simple fact he is no longer in the ""chasing"" stage. 

Theres nothing wrong to just ask if all is okay between you two though."
BPD,fctqqdl,t1_fcsz79o,1577954620.0,"Just remember that as long as you are doing the best you can, that you're doing great. Any other thought trying to suggest you're not is likely a negative thought.

I also see narcissistic traits in one of mine, too. Probably the hardest one to deal with as they can be very triggering, unintentionally. Or intentionally, I still cant work that out. 

Feel free to PM me if you need to chat or rant about anything."
BPD,fcsv8nl,t1_fcsrvd5,1577925970.0,"I use the kettle boiling to do my kitchen quite often. I see how much I can get done by the time it has boiled. Then how much I can do while my tea brews. Then stop and chill to drink it. Start again when I make my next one, which is as soon as I finish.

Timers are great because it's a challenge as well and I'm quite competitive. I'll definitely try and bring in my timer on my phone for other rooms in the house in the future."
BPD,fcss117,t1_fcsr8vw,1577923647.0,"It really does suck. 
Fingers crossed you can ride this out with ease"
