I know that reading tarot cards takes lots of practice and I'm still learning with a book but I feel like I can't tell when things will happen. Like, if I ask if I'm going to visit someone sometime this year, the time frame just doesn't come up.

I feel like I'm missing something. I do have a voice in my head but that is from anxiety and mental illness so that doesn't help either. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

Psychic,fi4fgbk,t3_f6cqpw,1582140116.0,"I am on the other side of the experience. I thank each person who gives me a reading and make sure that they know how their reading has helped me or where I can see how it resonates with me and my current situation.

I am impatient, however, I would never pressure the reader to hurry along a response or be rude to message them about getting to mine next. I understand how draining it can be to do a whole bunch of readings and how busy their lives are. 

Knowing your boundaries is a great thing and if people can't understand that then they don't deserve a reading. You are doing this out of the kindness of your heart. You and other readers are not robots that can go on forever doing readings.

Thank you (all readers) for offering your services for free and putting up with the not so kind people that want readings. You are offering a great service and I hope that you can find the balance you need in life. Love and light <3"

To be honest, we live in different states and long distance is hard to convey feelings. However, he has been so closed up that, there have been times where I feel like I have had to drag it out of him. He loves to play this push-pull tug of rope style game.

Your reading has put some ease in my anxiety and re-enforces the notion that I seriously need to learn how to be patient. Maybe this past time calling him out on him not being open enough has kinda pushed him into exploring it. I hope so, but I can only do so much.

I tend to put others first but am learning to put myself first and others second. I shall try the loving-kindness meditations as well. Never really thought to look them up. 

Thank you again, so so much!

p.s. I love the emojis you put in <3"

I’m very confused about the journey my friend (and crush) and I seem to be going on. 

Every reading I’ve done myself or someone else has done, always says it’s a good outcome, we’re a good match. I’ve even had marriage come up in three different readings. 

He seems so disinterested and won’t even talk to me right now. I know that tarot is not 100% and there is free will. I guess I’m just looking for direction. His name is Simon mine is Melissa."

Card 2 Present situation: King of Cups

Card 3 Outcome: The World.

I did a relationship reading for myself and the person that I like. Since I am new to tarot and reading cards, I'd like a second opinion, if that is possible. This is the reading that I got this from.

Since I use different tarot card I will tell you the ones that are swords and pentacles.

https://imgur.com/WyaPZQx
On the left represents me, on the right represents him, in the middle is an advice card for the both of us. I turned them over from top to bottom, mine then his and then the middle.

The triangle is swords (6) and the circle is pentacles (6). Click on the image to see them up close.
As far as I can tell, the cards are meant to be for the present, at least that is how I am interpreting it and the middle card is the outcome. 

Thank you for your help in advance!"

I know how horrible this disorder can be and even though they would have a much more understanding parent in me than I did in mine, I can barely take care of myself and my cat most days, I couldn't take care of another human that is completely dependent on me.

I'm completely fine with never having children. I have other reasons why I will remain child free but this is the main one.

Sadly, I don't think your father will admit it that he was out of line, but I do not know your situation as well as you do. Mine can never admit that he was wrong, no matter what.

twinflames,f6rp310,t3_dsrx94,1573113601.0,"The only one I don't agree with is never having met in person. 

I have never met mine in person (yet, very soon though) but we have been talking with each other for around 4 years. It's been extremely difficult and heartbreaking but I can't imagine being with anyone else. 

I also have done so much growing and learning about myself and gotten more in touch with my spiritual side. I have really grown as a person since being with him and talking with him. I'm no where near done but I am in a much better space in my life than I have been.

You can still get to know someone really well and never meet or meet later on and still be twin flames. Sometimes, like people say, that it isn't ultimately about being together, its about growth and ascension. So why couldn't someone be your TF without meeting in person?

I agree with it being really early in a friendship and eventually figuring out that you might be twin flames. Being so infatuated and codependent that you think they are your twin flame. Etc...

I can feel mine with me and he's in my dreams. We are in sync and we know what each other is thinking. We've had a lot of ups and downs. He's the runner and I am the chaser. 

I have had many relationships before this one and my last ex was a false twin.  I firmly believe my gut feeling and is very, very rarely wrong.
