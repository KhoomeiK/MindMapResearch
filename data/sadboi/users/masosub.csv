AmItheAsshole,es1atdk,t3_c5a4jh,1561492770.0,YTA massively. Trying to force your beliefs on someone regardless of their age or relation is wrong. Punishing her for having her own mind is totally wrong. She will grow to resent you if you keep up
BPD,erhh5ny,t3_c23pe6,1560875253.0,Congratulations!! You should be so proud of yourself
TooAfraidToAsk,ergu2bi,t3_c1wbvs,1560857745.0,This legit makes me so sad to read. Everyone should have access to healthcare and not be stuck in debt aftwerawds. Sure the nhs has its issues... But thank fuck it's there.
BPD,ergpqmg,t3_c1uxnx,1560852062.0,Sorry you're going through this op. I have the same issues too but it's slowly starting to get better. Good days and bad days. Hang in there and try to stay strong.
AmItheAsshole,ergpifg,t3_c1vwd3,1560851710.0,YTA. She deserves better. You sound extremely selfish and self centered op
AmItheAsshole,erf9jt7,t3_c1rxh0,1560803166.0,ESH. I also kinda think it was a dick move to write in a complain about him. Maybe he was just having a bad day. I can't stand people who waste their time with petty complaints like yours. Learn to just move on with your life. The formal complaint was totally unnecessary
AmItheAsshole,erf98lx,t3_c1rxwv,1560802962.0,NTA. your other half is acting like a child. For him to get mad because you fell asleep is rediculous.
AmItheAsshole,erf8ocy,t3_c1s0ld,1560802595.0,NTA but it sounds pretty shady to me....
AmItheAsshole,erf8axq,t3_c1s0x4,1560802352.0,NTA..  but I also don't think it's right to ask someone to stop seeing a friend of theirs regardless of their feelings between each other.
AmItheAsshole,erf7vmm,t1_erf5s8a,1560802070.0,Agreed. They all sound like massive assholes. Op deserves better
AmItheAsshole,erf77ah,t3_c1s436,1560801615.0,YTA. I'm sure your parents help you out in many ways. Do something nice back and help your dad out.
AmItheAsshole,erckpvp,t3_c19z1b,1560714776.0,YTA. Sorry to say you come off as incredibly insecure. So what if she was looking at your husband? I genuinely can't believe you confronted her about it... Wtf..
AmItheAsshole,erbohy8,t3_c13jmx,1560688760.0,Definitely NTA. You're teaching your child the reality of life. If she wants to live independently she needs to earn her money. Supporting her whilst at school is a completely different matter as the time she would spend working to earn money is better spent studying.

BPD,eqlxqcl,t3_byhwwt,1560152565.0,"Im not sure how I made the jump... I pretty much just got fed up of it one day. I was sick of seeing how well others were doing in life when I felt like I was stuck in the same place for years. It always made me feel a bit down every time I logged into facebook. 

Staying off social media has helped me massively. I've found its helped me out more time and effort into actual real relationships in my life and I have stopped comparing myself to people on a daily basis. I'd suggest deactivating your account first and seeing how you get on without it for a while. It will still be there if you want to go back to it. If you decide you don't, then you could either leave it deactivated or delete it completely"
BPD,eqjvzoz,t1_eqhq9lb,1560112190.0,Me too. I decided a year ago to just stay off social media completely. It's done me wonders
