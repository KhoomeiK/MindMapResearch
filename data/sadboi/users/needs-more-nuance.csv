PsychMelee,ezbfjg9,t1_ez3k124,1567819786.0,Do you work in psychiatry or a related field?
PsychMelee,ez3etal,t1_eyv38jj,1567666055.0,I second this. Try to go to a doc or a therapist before a psychiatrist. They will push pills onto you because it's their SOLE JOB to prescribe. A therapist can not prescribe. They will work with you long term and get you to a stable place and might refer you to a therapist if it seems reasonable. Find a support network in real life if you can.

I think I was 15 or so. People would all say things like “I’m doing great! Good! Well!” And that’s when I realized something was really wrong with me because I couldn’t relate."
