depression,erttrm3,t3_c3xcit,1561253034.0,Ppl always ask me how scared or pissed or whatever emotion I feel and I haven't felt emotion in a long while due to that problem. I'm oblivious to the situation and I love God so my faith will either deliver the desired outcome of sunlight to the underground (maybe through mirrors or technology) and safety above ground for gushy skinned peeps and whatever natural or the evil forces will win in detriment of sitting around a dead human race wondering why God allowed them the free will to do all of this. I feel like it's my job to inform. Light in formation ceases to be pure light. Don't cease the beeping of your light. Don't beep her minute. Don't be permanent. Be my minute minions of snaky freedom and March yourselves into my slaughterhouse snakeskin doohickey factory that makes snakeskin shoes and drums and all kinds of shit. Anyway I'd prefer if the remaining species didn't die of petty or spite.

Turns out it was the crystal necklace danburite and the moldavite Crystal in my hat raising my vibes to ungroundable levels to the point where I was giving somewhere at a space of being between the sun and Mercury and if the model is taken to scale and done with sine waves that causes a 15 hz dissonance which numbs the listening mind so nobody could hear me basically and only because of my actually light body frequency being so amplified and it may have confused ppl that I was using some wave music too but that has no affect, just mildly interactive music. I took the crystals off, so now biggoty war is over! Hope all is well. I heard some strange things going on and it sounded as though some ppl may have lost their freedoms or something and I expect a solution is underway. I've been oblivious. Ptthhh!"

This tends to be especially important for men, who are more likely to have been taught to suppress their feelings from a young age. Men under the influence of blue lace agate might find themselves more aware of and accepting of their sensitivities and feelings-- a benefit that girlfriends and wives everywhere might be grateful for. This stone is also said to make public speaking easier and more effective for students or those who speak publicly for a living (such as lecturers, teachers, workshop directors, and the like), enhance success for singers, aid nervous and tactless talkers, help the ability to keep secrets, provide clarity (including for imaginative children), and promote trust, composure, inner stability, security, self confidence and maturity.
