If you have a microchip feeder, are you able to customize how much they can eat and when? Our feeders are customizable down to an hourly allowance of time for our cats to eat so they can feel like they have the ability to graze and eat whenever they want without actually eating constantly. 

We also have a cat on prescription food and he eats separately once in the morning and once at bedtime. He went from around 13 pounds to 10 just by eating more reasonable portions. When he was eating all of his food at once, he tended to try to eat more. Now his weight is stable, he isn't angry and everything is good."
CatAdvice,fr2fh2x,t3_gm9lxk,1589836371.0,"From my own experience with an anxious cat that liked to spray everywhere because of his anxiety, I literally cannot recommend enough talking to your vet and getting him on anxiety medication. If you're already doing the pheromone diffusers, he may be too anxious for that to help him calm down. He needs to be checked out by the vet to make sure he doesn't have any urinary issues (UTI or crystals or something) and then talk to them about his anxiety. My cat takes Prozac (5mg a day) and it has been a night and day difference for him.  His personality hasn't changed at all, but you can tell he's a lot less stressed and he hasn't peed anywhere other than the litter box since we started him on it like 4 months ago."
