I actually researched it after the bizarre, byzantine experience I had when my daughter was an infant. They would rather give money to a private company than a citizen.


* they wanted me to quit the job I already had in order to attend mandatory workshops *that trained you on how to apply, interview, write a resume, etc* You COULD NOT receive child care assistance without attending these classes. If you brought a child to these classes, it was a violation
 If you missed a class for any reason other than a doctor's note, it was a violation. If you were issued a violation, you were kicked out of the program, and then barred from receiving any type of public assistance for the next year.

So we're there to receive childcare vouchers. But we need to have childcare in order to be there. 

You need to receive job training. If you already have a job, that is no reason to not be in the training classes.
