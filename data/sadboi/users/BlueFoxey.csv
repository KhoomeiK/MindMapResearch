You could consider the visuals as a way to tell whether you're anxious, that's kinda how I use it that way cuz what you described sounds extremely similar to what I got, and I am one anxiety bean.

My therapist once told me that every action we take, everything we do, communicates something to the outside world. So you gotta ask yourself, what are you trying to tell them by leaving? Reddit can't answer this for you. You gotta figure it out yourself, which is tough and may take a while.

But it seems like level 1 or less could also enjoy it for the same reason as superhero movies, cuz of the amazing animation. 

In fact, I think this is a part he didn't phrase well. A show doesn't HAVE an autism level. It's just that certain shows can be enjoyed in certain ways. It's actually all about the way you enjoy a show that determines the autism level. 

For example, FLCL:

Do you think it's a wacky over the top well-animated show? You're level 1. 

Do you relate to the themes behind the weird storyline and do you see the symbolism of the whole growing up things and the character arcs? You're level 2. 

Do you love all the references and feel like you understand the intentions for specific scenes and love how it comments on other shows and stuff? You're level 3. 

Do you HEAVILY relate to a specific character and feel like the show is pretty much about you or something along those lines? That's in the level 4+ range, idk much about the specific levels Digi mentioned. 

I might've been off with the specific levels and might've confused some, but this is basically what it boils down to. I think this is why Digi struggles to give shows a specific number. Cuz it doesn't work like that. Certain shows just have the potential for certain levels to enjoy it certain ways. That's not an exact science. That's vague probability based on the frame through which people look at and interpret the world which is based on culture and personality and psychology and the mood you're in and the context and etc. Autism isn't exactly the right word for this, but that's because this is a new concept. We don't HAVE a word for this yet. Autism is such a vague term cuz it's what we use for the mannerisms that we don't get yet. 

That's what I think. If only Digi used reddit so he could weigh in on this."

sleep,eyj6pgv,t3_cx4gb1,1567113406.0,"I, too, get that sometimes. I have two cats, but they're never allowed in my room at night. So it's really weird that I get that, but sometimes I swear I can feel a cat walking on my bed. Not sure what it is, hopefully someone smart will be able to explain this phenomenon. I didn't know this was a thing other people had. I never get sleep paralysis, though."
