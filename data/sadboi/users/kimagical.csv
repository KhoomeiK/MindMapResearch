Edit: [This](https://images.app.goo.gl/6eWnRH6EPbo98Pkm9) guy looks like he skipped leg day a lot but you get the same thing from people who work out only their upper body too much. He looks like he gained at least 10cm and by working out his legs he seems like he'd look pretty natural."

Also my legs are currently disproportionately short. I have the torso of a 6 ft tall guy (I am taller sitting down than my 6 ft friends) yet my pants inseam length is 26 inches which is 14 year old size. So lengthening them would only bring them into proportion.

Yes in those videos he does not look in prime physical condition, but not bad either. I've also seen videos of people weightlifting even more than they had before LL. And it might have been a doctor who went past safe procedures.
