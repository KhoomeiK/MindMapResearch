My â€˜â€™sperm donorâ€™â€™s brother gave me a ridiculous name. My mother tried to object because she wanted to name me something else, but their entire family ganged up on her and pressured her to go along with it.

That name came to bite me in the behind when I started school. I suffered harsh bullying growing up. My classmates made so much fun of me and my name, you wouldnâ€™t believe it. I began lying about my name at age 11, everytime I introduced myself to someone new. The sheer fear of being made fun of surpassed any moral sense I had about lying. I did this for years. That bit me in the behind just as much.

I legally changed my name at age 18. Now I have a dull, regular olâ€™ name, just like I always wanted. I have never felt happier.

Please, donâ€™t give your children ridiculous names for the sake of being quirky, because the name is different from the regular Mary or because the name has sentimental value/meaning to you. If itâ€™s a bully-magnet, drop it. Your child may not share your sentiments and other children and adults can and will mock them. Itâ€™s not even funny.

Using depression like this guy is doing is the reason why thereâ€™s a stigma to it. Itâ€™s horrible and people wonâ€™t take it seriously. I too hope he gets the help he needs and hopefully some personality adjustment while heâ€™s at it. Seems he took the cowards way out by deleting this post though instead of owning up to his mistakes. I really hope he learned something here nonetheless though. This kind of behavior is toxic and infuriating and he needs to get his head out of his a*s and understand that his actions have consequences. He canâ€™t cheat, treat her like sh*t and then expect her and others to still bend over backwards for him because he has depression. Using suicide threats for sympathy or to emotionally blackmail his girlfriend is preposterous too. He needs a severe reality check. I would never have done this to anyone and I would never let anyone do this to me.
If he is in real danger, he needs to call for help. I hope she gets help too!"

Trust is fundamental. She needs to leave him and learn to trust again, but with someone else. This guy cheats, then he vilifies her and uses his depression as a sympathy card. Depression doesnâ€™t make him an asshole, his personality does.

Please stop giving advice to people. This is some grade A bs.

He talks to his ex for hours, sends kissy faces, compliments and miss yous and SHEâ€™S the insecure one? Is anyone here buying this? Seriously. No. He can be there for her in a crisis, but the things I pointed out above are completely unneccessary. This is, most of the time, how emotional affairs happen. The ex or whatnot is a mess, the guy in the relationship runs to soothe her misery, thinking flirting is appropriate because Â«crisisÂ» and boom. 
I have supported exes and male friends in crisis without taking it to that level and guess what? It worked out fine. Lots of people do that without the flirting and sneaking. I wouldnâ€™t bat an eye if my SO was there for an ex or a friend during an emergency. That would prove to me once again that he is a kind person. But the fucking flirting? Come on. Really?

She isnâ€™t wrong to question this. Itâ€™s NORMAL to question this. Insecurity is a word people like you love to throw around to the point where it becomes meaningless. 

Your partner slept with someone? Youâ€™re just insecure!
Your partner flirts with other people? Youâ€™re just insecure!

What the fuck.

No, OP, please listen. This is not normal or okay, fetish or not. Porn is one thing but messaging and flirting with other people behind your back is NOT OKAY imo and IS a breach of trust. I would never tolerate this shit.
If she wanted to role-play, she would ask you. Sheâ€™s not interested in that. And even if she is, it may or may not feel good for you. Itâ€™s up to you to decide weither itâ€™s something youâ€™re willing to work on and figure out a solution and compromise. Or if itâ€™s too big a risk and a deal breaker. Think about it, explore your feelings and take it from there! Best of luck to you, man!

Note; Not everybody is okay with their partner flirting and wanting to/trying to or actually cheating, even if it is just a fetish. Actively lying about and hiding stuff like this is a red flag and a big NO for many. Stop normalizing this kind of behavior. Not everybody wants to be a cuck and thatâ€™s okay. If you do, by all fucking means, have fun. But donâ€™t downplay this guyâ€™s feelings and this womanâ€™s behavior. If this was happening to me, I would have bailed yesterday.

relationship_advice,fktykck,t3_fkk13v,1584538116.0,"Do you understand your situation?

You should LEAVE, like yesterday. This isnâ€™t just porn addiction. Itâ€™s way worse. He breaks your stuff, scares you to the point where you need to flee, then he proceeds to stop you and then.. what, cry? Fucking cry. Really?
No.

This is beyond not okay. This is borderline abusive, if not full blown abuse (considering youâ€™ve only pointed out this problem specificially. I have a feeling thereâ€™s much more going on)
Iâ€™m not in the Â«dump and runÂ» reddit bandwagon but this is actually pretty severe. 
Porn is fine, as long as it doesnâ€™t hurt your sex life. Jacking it to Facebook photos? Paying for premium snapchat? Camgirls? Instagram girls you can and will message? While in a relationship? I donâ€™t care what people say, thatâ€™s pathetic and absurd and I would NEVER tolerate such behavior from my partner. He would be single and free to do whatever he wants. I would not put up with that even if I got a lifetime supply of money and my favorite chocolate chip icecream for it. I deserve better and so do you.
Dump and run.

The crying is a manipulation. How good/bad you look has nothing to do with it. This has nothing to do with you. There are hot girls who get cheated on all the time, there are hot girls who are abused, neglected and used on a daily basis. This has nothing to do with how you are as a person, your looks and whatever. HE is manipulative, a massive liar, mentally abusive and a danger to your health. He doesnâ€™t allow you to speak to others about this because he knows others may help you realize how absolutely bonkers and toxic this fucking idiot is. That would be inconvenient for him.

I want to make one thing clear though; You canâ€™t save, reason with, help or rescue this guy. Donâ€™t delude yourself and waste time. People can only save themselves, best done through therapy. He doesnâ€™t need regular talk therapy. He needs strict, behavioral therapy and something tells me heâ€™s not willing to go through that because he thinks what heâ€™s doing is okay. Itâ€™s not. Even if he, through some mighty miracle decides to do therapy, you should not stick around for it. Leave. If he truly wants change, he will work for it with or without you.
Let me tell you one more time: You canâ€™t save him.
He has proven to you time and time again that he doesnâ€™t give a rats ass about your boundries and feelings. If he did, he wouldnâ€™t be doing this. But here you are. You can and will catch him doing this again and again and again in an endless cycle until youâ€™ve either A) accepted this, or B) decided itâ€™s not worth the misery.
The crying and begging is a term called Â«Love bombingÂ», google it and research it deeper. Itâ€™s not real, he doesnâ€™t actually feel guilt or remorse. He doesnâ€™t want change. He wants to keep you around, not because he gives a shit, but because itâ€™s convenient for him. He just wants to have his cake and eat it too.
Stop falling for it.


Obviously, itâ€™s your decision if you want to stay or leave, but if you choose to stay: Donâ€™t delude yourself by thinking you even remotely have a shot at fixing this moron. You donâ€™t.

I say, dump him and save yourself. You matter. Your life and wellbeing MATTER and should be your FIRST PRIORITY. You deserve BETTER. You are so much, so, so much more than this guy will ever comprehend.

relationship_advice,fk7biu9,t3_fgw6pb,1583932801.0,"Hi!
I used to struggle with BPD too, been symptom free for a couple of years now and under control though. But I can relate to your way of thinking and I understand where youâ€™re coming from.

I think youâ€™re fine. A boss at 22, studying and keeping it going! Thatâ€™s very admireable. You seem like youâ€™re doing your best to be mindful and respectful of your boyfriends decisions and lifestyle. Thatâ€™s also good.

But, that being said - itâ€™s completely normal to want to see the person you love more than once a week. That doesnâ€™t make you clingy or crazy. Clingy is when youâ€™re attached to your boyfriends hip nearly all the time. Crazy is demanding constant time together, refusing to give him time alone and controlling who heâ€™s friends with/what he does, etc. You donâ€™t seem to be either of those judging from this post, so turn that frown upside down and donâ€™t be so hard on yourself! Youâ€™re good.
Back to the point though, itâ€™s completely reasonable to want to spend more than one day a week with him and you should have a calm, mature conversation with him about this.

Tell him how you feel and how much youâ€™d appreciate spending an extra day or two together every now and then because you wish to be closer to him. Ask him how he feels about that and if heâ€™s willing to.
Try to figure out a compromise! You should be in his list of priorities since youâ€™re his girlfriend! 
How is your communication? How often do you guys text/call? Is he happy when youâ€™re together? 
Either way, have a talk with him! Remember, â€˜â€™Iâ€™â€™-statements.
For example: â€˜â€™Firstly, I love and respect you alot and Iâ€™m happy to have you in my life. But I feel like Iâ€™m not a priority in your life sometimes and it makes me feel sad. I would like for us to spend more time together and doing so would make me happy. What do you think? Are you willing to try?â€™â€™

Please, do not let him turn this into a BPD thing or use it against you in this conversation. This is not an unreasonable request, BPD or not. 
If his answer is no, you need to decide weither or not thatâ€™s a deal breaker. Always put your well-being first.
If itâ€™s a yes, then there you go! All good!

As for the friends part. Itâ€™s not easy for everyone to make them, but you seem to be trying and wanting to. Thatâ€™s very positive! Iâ€™m here if you ever want to talk. I know Iâ€™m a stranger on the internet, but I wouldnâ€™t mind having a new friend or two myself. Feel free to DM me!

Youâ€™re right, the health care system is shit sometimes, Iâ€™ve read about people who were talked down to or resented by their therapists simply for having this diagnosis. Itâ€™s a nightmare for those who seek help to recover.

Whatâ€™s worse is the way theyâ€™ve been adamant that BPD is permanent until fairly recently.
I was told I just had to live with it, but I refused.
I wanted so badly to get better, so I focused all my energy on that.

Just like you, Iâ€™m symptom free today. I no longer meet the criteria for the diagnosis and it was effectively removed last month. Although Iâ€™ve been symptom free for three years and counting, me and my therapist decided to wait and see how things would turn out in distressing situations. 
Letâ€™s just say I lived up to her expectations and surpassed my own.


I am a healthy person today. Iâ€™m in a healthy, long term relationship with an amazing man. Iâ€™ve grown into an introvert who doesnâ€™t need to spend much time with others. I actually enjoy my own company alot more, my head isnâ€™t a scary place to be in anymore. I get along with my family. I get along with most people I meet.

Like, yeah, I get it. The grass is greener blah blah. Youâ€™re resenting your fiancÃ© for no reason, youâ€™re nitpicking and trying to find excueses you can use to justify what youâ€™re doing. 
There IS no justification for what youâ€™re doing. You did this to yourself the second you thought going behind your fiancÃ©s back was a good idea.
You did this to yourself when you neglected to communicate your feelings to both your girlfriend and fiancÃ©.

If you want to fix this, what you need to do is take respsonsibility for your own feelings and actions, strap on your fucking party hat and tell them both exactly what you are up to and what you are thinking because they deserve to know, especially your fiancÃ© who is clueless. Then all three of you need to have an open discussion about all of this and come up with appropriate boundries and Â«rulesÂ» to prevent this shit from ever happening again.
You do NOT get to guilt trip, play the victim or put the blame on them. Your girlfriend needs to take responsibility for her role in this absolute clusterfuck too. You do not get to make excueses for her or yourself during this discussion. You need to tell them honestly.

You also need to be prepared for the fact that this may be a dealbreaker for both your girlfriend and fiancÃ©. Your girlfriend may not want an exclusive relationship with you alone and your fiancÃ© might leave your cheating ass.

Now listen. Even if your girlfriend DID want to be with you only, what then? Sheâ€™s fun and exciting for the next few months and then it dies down because the honeymoon phase does. Youâ€™re blindsided by your own emotions, you canâ€™t see the grass for what it is. Grass. You need to water and mowe it equally on both sides. Eventually your girlfriend is going to move in. Youâ€™re gonna have to put up with doing the dishes when she goes off in her two cars. Youâ€™re gonna have fights. Maybe she gets irritated at your exessive yawning and you get tired of it. Maybe she wants to do her own thing when she comes home from work and doesnâ€™t wanna spend that much time with you. Maybe her libido drops because she gets put on meds one day. Maybe she wants to hang out with her male friends. Maybe sheâ€™s friends with her ex. What are you gonna do then? Get angry and jealous? Look for some other exciting and fun girl because now sheâ€™s just another normal human with flaws? Because mark my words, boy, nothing is perfect and you have to actually WORK for the relationship.
You donâ€™t come off as the type whoâ€™s willing to put in effort on relationships long term. You get bored and jump at the chance for new grass when you neglect to take care of the old.
Show some dedication, you self obsorbed moron. Have some fucking self-accountability.

You need to nib this in the bud now before it gets worse. You should never have let it come to this in the first place.

The only fault in your fiancÃ© is that she didnâ€™t set boundries. You on the other hand, are guilty of the exact same and then some. 
Do your best to fix it or dump them both, then do some self reflection. You clearly need it.
