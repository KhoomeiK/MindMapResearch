I know it sounds obvious but I think for a long time I genuinely believed that things that were most appealing in the moment (like binge watching a TV show instead of doing work) were the same things that made me feel good when in reality the opposite was true.

It took me a while to properly understand that being productive isn't some horrible chore I just have to do, it's something that makes me feel good and happy.

academia,fqe890o,t3_gial9w,1589303362.0,"Your post could be an extract from my journal near the end of my PhD and looking back I was very depressed at that time. 

The feelings you are having are ok to have but remember too, this is just one way of looking at things. You're in an outlook now where everything looks bleak and you've failed, but that isn't based on concrete things. You could 10 papers under your belt but still find a way to feel the same because it's not really about the stats, it's a state of mind and way of looking at yourself.

I struggled through my PhD due to mental health and I most definitely missed opportunities because I wasn't working hard enough. And that's ok. I'm human. I did my best. I've learned from it and continued working and developed better habits and ending up working on great projects where no one gives a shit what I was like during my PhD. 

I'm sure this has come up in your therapy because I ignored it in mine for long enough but it sounds like you expect too much from yourself and you don't take into account that we are not robots and so sometimes things do not go perfectly to plan. Cut yourself some slack, reflect on the ways you've done your best, and look at what things you could put in place to support yourself to do better in the future."

I think that's why I'm a bit confused by the idea because the severity of my depression doesn't necessarily correspond with how well I'm reacting to negative thoughts. And sometimes they are absent e.g. my mind could feel completely empty while I'm having lots of intense feelings. I'm going to look into the link you posted though. 

If it makes any difference there are question marks around the possibility of a bipolar diagnosis with my psychiatrist wanting to wait and see in terms of diagnosis. So I have had pretty dramatic flips e.g. severely suicidal for months to suddenly feeling great and completely recovered. Those kinds of shifts certainly make it feel like your thoughts are just a symptom of where your mood is at as opposed to the main determinant of mood."

Things can improve though, realistically your next year of work could just as likely be good than bad.

I actually saw 2 psychiatrists. One was public and it was a bit weird and pointless, the other was private and I got a lot more out of it. She basically just asked me to describe any significant points around my mental health in chronological order (which took a while!). It was pretty obvious from that that I have recurring depression, I'd just never understood it that way. 

With more complex things it can take a bit of time in terms of diagnosis. There's still a question mark over a potential bipolar diagnosis, but since I'm doing okay right now (waiting lists took some time..) the approach is here's some strategies/ideas for staying well and you're in the system now so if things get bad we can quickly reassess.

You know you're thinking irrationally and your own assessment on your work is probably affected by that. You can't trust your judgement of yourself right now, so if you start kicking yourself with thoughts of being a failure, etc.. you have to remember that those thoughts aren't trustworthy because they're not coming from someone in a good place. Some CBT might help with this, but the point is, you don't have to agree with the negative thoughts, work on countering them and rejecting them because logically they are not aiding to your success or wellbeing. 

I was convinced my work was terrible for a long time but I made peace with worst case scenarios and that allowed me to just focus on submitting.

My scenarios were:  It could be so bad they would kick me out with nothing - never happened in my department and chances of it happening when a supervisor likes your work is slim, if it happened to me I'd find a new career and move on. I could be given revise and resubmit - happened once in my department, the guy resubmit and passed, not the end of the world. Major corrections - bit of hassle but again you still get there in the end. Turns out I got minor corrections and put a lot of stress and energy into needless worry. 

Once you are done with your PhD you won't even think about it anymore and to be honest people don't ask you about it either. It just becomes a thing you did. I think with the money situation you wouldn't really want to quit, so just focus on submitting. If it all goes to shit after that, well you can move on and reconfigure, but for now just focus on crossing the finish line. That alone is an accomplishment, no matter what happens next."

I could definitely see how that could potentially be a trigger for what I may have already had a predisposition for. I think it always seemed like an excuse for depression too, like 'yeah it's weird I'm 12 and intensely suicidal but it's probably just because  I'm still hung up on that death'. 

I feel like I did eventually process it and it's not something I struggle with anymore but it took a while to see that the depression wasn't just a reaction to situations but something a bit more unpredictable."

Yes, it is a mood disorder but when most people's experiences of moods are more along the lines of 'I feel good today' or 'I feel like shit', calling it a mood disorder can also be misleading to the general public. It makes it seem like bipolar people experience what others do, we just yo-yo between happy/sad more than others, hence the stupid jokes/stereotypes. 

Personally, I like to call it a brain disorder. It effects everything from energy and mood to creativity and cognitive function. I definitely find there is a big physical aspect to my episodes, for example I can literally feel depression and it is very different than when I'm feeling shitty for a few days because I'm upset about something.

I've started to notice a sign for me is that everything just feels perfect and right in my life even though nothing may have changed from when I was depressed.

At it's worst I'm excessively promiscuous, may do illegal things, I don't feel any shame or embarrassment so I will do or say incredibly inappropriate things but not realise they are inappropriate, I have so many ideas that I don't actually finish any of them which might not sound bad but is when you do something like quit your job to start a business, I get very angry at people challenging me or irrationally ragey if people aren't doing what I expect they should, I tell people how I'm going to be a millionaire/famous etc which is very embarrassing for non-hypo me to deal with. I get very spiritual over things I think are bullshit normally. I think overall I just look back and see someone that isn't really me yet everything made sense at the time.

I do get mixed episodes and they are where the negative side of it really comes out in a more immediately obvious way. I will be depressed but constantly on edge and anxious. I get very paranoid and irritable. I could be uninterested in doing anything but also feel constantly uncomfortable and like I need to do something. It's just the most agitated, uncomfortable place to be. I can't sleep and I feel exhausted but also wired at the same time. I had a severe eating disorder during a mixed episode once, it was delusional thinking and hallucinations paired with the energy and goal oriented mentality of mania, really nasty stuff, and then it completely vanished and never struggled with it again. I've also gotten very religiously delusional too, e.g. 'God is punishing me so I will draw near to him and this is actually a gift from God', so I would spend all my time praying and crying. The mixed for me really makes me feel mentally ill, like I might crack at any moment. 

Realistically, it's taken a long time and a few rounds of it for me to recognise the issue with my hypo times because they have generally felt very pleasurable, particularly in contrast to depression, although I know some people have a more negative experience. The mixed episodes have also been the worst for me and the most identifiable as problematic, much more than normal depression, but it took me a while to realise that was because of the combination of the elevated and depressed mood. It might be worth looking at it more from that perspective if the typical hypo experience isn't relatable to you."

BipolarReddit,evs38ib,t1_evracz8,1564728001.0,"Still functioning at home and work would be a definite no sometimes and I've had experiences where I knew I lost my mind, but it's easy to rationalise it away too when that's a rarer occurrence. I suppose I only thought it was a problem if I'm at that extreme end of the spectrum, I never realised that more subtle symptoms are actually symptoms and not just normal experience if that makes sense."
BipolarReddit,evjnyke,t3_ck00w3,1564566273.0,"I think what also confuses things is that psychiatrists can have very different interpretations, particularly since the DSM specifies 'significant impairment'. I've heard psychiatrists saying mania is 100% clear to everyone around you and is almost certain to end in hospitalisation/arrest. 

But then I also listened to this psych lately, who literally runs a bipolar clinic and in his example at 10:28 he classifies it as being full blown mania because of length and that it led to issues at work so counts as significant impairment. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oQV38yXmO90. I would have thought of that as hypomania. 

I do think there is an issue with people romanticising mania. Evidence seems to suggest it does damage to your brain and diagnostically it leads to impairment. But I can also get the desire to feel that again when you feel lifeless and empty with depression. I think from the sub's perspective mania chasing behaviours have to be discouraged as dangerous and irresponsible. 

I also think it can be hard to know the line sometimes. There was a time I thought was the best time of my life because I felt so incredibly confident and adventurous but over time I've revaluated that as I've realised how much of my behaviour was recklessly dangerous, illegal and inappropriate as well as completely out of character. Does that count as significant impairment? It can be very hard evaluate."
