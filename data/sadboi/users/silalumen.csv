Both companies present their own architectures and technology as a selling point which is great, however developers of games don't want to waste time optimizing for one or another and/or making optimal use of the features as there aren't enough of a user base out there with SLI/Crossfire setups. The end result is AMD/Nvidia leaving it up to the user to set up their own settings when using multi gpus per game since there will always be incompatibilities depending on the title for the initial reason I stated."

Gameplay wise *it feels like* there hasn't been much change other than to the mods that roll on the gear, and maybe increased drop rates of legendary items by a lot.

nvidia,fkdg3tk,t1_fjp0ddl,1584077522.0,I doubt even a shortage of production due to corona virus would make it more valuable. I think there's enough stock laying around because not everyone can afford 1k+ for a GPU just to play games. The only thing I can see raising the value is if there's another crypto boom.
nvidia,fkdftf1,t3_feg725,1584077242.0,"Honestly, I think the next generation will be the one to get for 4k gaming. Right now I have a modded Vega 64 (overclocked on a custom cooler) and an EVGA 2080 Super... Granted they're in very different tiers and a generation apart, neither of them can reliably do 4k on newer titles without lowering quality to a roughly medium setting. I think the 20xx series is not drastically better than a 10xx series gpu in terms of the performance bump, but if you look at Nvidia's history, they tend to have a big jump roughly every other gen. If I had to do an educated guess, the 3070 will probably be close to a 2080 ti's performance.

Edit: Expect a 2070 super to be roughly the performance of a 2080 non super, or somewhere between 2080 and 2080S if you overclock. For reference, I can't get a stable 60FPS on FFXV when running medium/high mix settings on 4k. If you're okay with playing 2k on a 4k monitor a 2070S wouldn't be too bad though."
