Idioms/expressions like ""rip the bandaid"" or ""like jumping into a cold pool"" have helped me in the past when I'm hemming and hawing regarding an important decision, phone call, conversation etc.- everything is usually worse in your imagination and things usually get better once you get it over with. 

I apologize to you personally if my comment triggered negative feelings from your past. 

My comment was meant more as an enthusiastic nudge and a reminder that the help is already there, they just need to reach for it and that the one judging them the most is themselves. Their therapist will help them and accept them, regardless of this particular issue they're dealing with. 

Everyone is different, this kind of approach works for me, I need that enthusiastic nudge and the reassurance that I'm capable of doing the things I'm apprehensive about, and that even if I fail, I have a support system to catch me.  I hope that some day, the OP can feel comfortable enough with themselves and their therapist to tackle issues like these head on, without fear of judgement. We're all humans here.

There are so many unexpected twists and turns in life, and good or bad, you never know what you're going to miss (you really don't). 

**The only guarantee in life is death.**

It's already going to happen. There's no need to actively pursue it, you already have an appointment set, hopefully, in the distant future.

Everyone has their own unique suffering, we're all stuck in the human condition, you can't compare and rank your meat suit pain to that of others, it is your own, and to everyone else, their own issues are also the most painful and real. 

Might as well do the least harm possible to others (sometimes part of that is finding ways to train oneself to learn how to do so), including yourself and to try to help others with their burden of suffering, while we're here. 

Try to keep busy by doing your best to help.

The saddest part is, if they already don't care, they won't magically start caring. They may feel a bit bad for a while, but they'll eventually just find it selfish of you to have done that and over time, they will be left with mostly shitty memories of you, vindicating their decision to not be around you/not care. You'd be proving every negative assumption they had of you as right. 

*Harming yourself to harm someone that does not care about you does not make sense*, *they don't care about you*. 

So, what's the real issue here? 

Is a part of you afraid of finding, liking (and losing) someone who does care about you? So much that you might unconsciously choose to obsess over unattainable and/or toxic people that you'll never be able to actually *have* and therefore, you'll never risk the emotional surprise of potentially losing them? 

Would you say that you sometimes feel like  ""I would not want to be a part of any club that'd have me as a member""?

aspergirls,fqpm87o,t3_gk33y1,1589549610.0,"I initially found this post to be surprising as I feel that, personally, materials like rayon, acrylic and polyester, are the the ones that cause me *the most* skin irritation in within the realm of socks. Usually, the ones I find in store (the really friggin' cute ones that are thin, have cool prints, glittery threads, even see-thru elements..)  do not protect me much from chafing and do not help much with wicking away sweat from the foot- which can lead to the aforementioned irritation and chafing.

[*inhales*] 

*That said*, I've always remembered that the least offensive of the synthetic material made socks I've tried are certain models of Golden Toe socks. They're actually quite comfortable, and seem to be of relatively high quality, as I've noticed that they can last for ages compared to other synthetic socks that practically *dissolve*  after a few wash/dry cycles.

I used to think (until today, actually,lol)  that they only made them in the stereotypical, black, *dad/grandpa sock* that had yellow (""golden"") stitching reinforcing at the toe- but they seem to have expanded their product line to include a variety of women's socks. They actually have a bunch of cute models- from printed ""no-shows"" to sporty compression socks (and even cute knee highs for boots!). 

 Check out their site, here are a few examples:

That sounds a lot like what you seem to be experiencing. You keep getting stuck in these traps because you are believing everything you are feeling. 

The truth is, that the first person you are doing a disservice to by continuing to engage with emotionally destructive people is yourself.

Show yourself that compassion that these people don't cherish from you. 

It hurts to watch the wounded animal, the trap looks inhumane. Recognize that you are both animals, you're both writhing in traps of your own making. 

As a side note, please, considering that they are your fellow humans, you are not giving them very much credit by not believing that they have the capacity to help themselves without you, it's kind of infantilizing them (or I guess dehumanizing, when we see them as wild animals). 

There is an element that sounds like you're romanticizing their suffering as well. They're not Back Beauty or a regal leopard, stuck in a trap not able to verbalize their suffering because they're non-human creatures- they're people just like you, on their own journeys, suffering with you, like you. 

They are your equals. They can't save you any more than you can them. 

Do not distract yourself from your own pain, I say that in a loving way. 

> But it feels selfish and unfair to quit on someone who can't help putting out his worst into the world doesnt it?

You're not ""quitting"" on them- there was never a legitimate ""starting"" to cure their suffering or anything noble to having you sacrifice your own self respect in an attempt to untangle someone else's web, one whose entire set of causes and solutions are and will forever be unknown and ultimately not corresponding to your purview, and that's O.K.

It's not your job to fix anyone. Once you can wholeheartedly notice that you're not on the same wavelength with someone, and that they're not kind or respectful to you or other beings, detach and move on.

There are many living, breathing, **good** people out there who are *way* past the ""potential"" stages. 

Just stop wasting your own time, slowly gathering hurt, while trying to fix what you have no capacity to (true change is only intrinsic in nature and you can not try to be a catalyst for anyone's personal changes, no matter how involved you are). 

If you feel like you're kind of stuck on this phase, unsure about others, ask yourself if there's a chance that you could be projecting some of your own feelings about *yourself* as ""having the potential to change"" onto others? 

In a way, one could possibly be creating a pattern of seeking out people that reflect your own need to change certain habits for the better? This kind of relationship might be attractive to the subconscious because interacting with them: a)reminds you of something about yourself and/or b) is easier to occupy yourself with *their* faults at those moments,  rather than taking time for *yourself* and investing in the work and loving energy of making changes in your own life? 

These are just possibilities, I don't know you and I apologize if I offended you with my suggestions/ideas.


Overall, my point is that you have the power to change this particular set of situations in your life and they have little to do with whether or not people are inherently good or bad or capable of change. 

All humans have the potential to change and they all begin good at heart. You and everyone who was ever shitty to you were all babies once, and all of you had and still have the same capacity for good you did during infancy.

You have the capacity to change your surroundings and the variety of people you choose to be present around you. This starts with your own inherent capacity to make changes in the way you operate with others and the space that you decide to give people in your life. Time is precious. Shed what does not serve you at this moment.

Empaths,fqlrksh,t1_fqlcmf6,1589464720.0,"An unstable sense of identity or self is a hallmark of BPD. 

However, much of what you describe, including the trauma of growing up with narcissists can lead to a disorder called CPTSD which shares some symptoms with BPD, including the unstable sense of identity and emotional dysregulation (ED).

Empaths,fqlr00d,t3_gjevqc,1589464401.0,"You need to see a physician. 

Go get a diagnosis. It's the only way to know for sure. 

Being an empath has nothing to do with BPD. 

It sounds like you're on to something. 


If you don't have a therapist already, search for one in your area. Many are doing telemedicine now because of the pandemic."

I don't even drink any of that shit. Apparently, the American ""South"" has a *thing* regarding their iced tea tastes.

CPTSD,fqilj9a,t3_givgqr,1589397605.0,"The subreddit itself is not bad, your relationship to it may be bad. 

Your identity is not ""CPTSD"". 

You should consider telling your therapist about these feelings, how you might be using the sub as a crutch to avoid relationships with others IRL and take steps to balance your RL and the time you spend in this subreddit. 


Support is great, depending on it, not so much. 

I commend you on your self-awareness."

pharmacy,fqijovp,t1_fqifwf1,1589396902.0,"Correct. 

It's a matter of opinion, of course, some people don't care. 

I work at an independent community pharmacy (mom & pop) and do the same. Some of my meds are just more affordable at chains, they have buying power. That's where I use GoodRx. 

If you go to a ""mom & pop"" pharmacy, I'd generally refrain from using it, but you can always ask them if it's going to affect their bottom line- sometimes it's not too bad and they'll probably appreciate that you cared. ^heh

Always shop around, and always ask, you'd be surprised how much you can save."
relationship_advice,fqiir0u,t3_giu0w1,1589396541.0,"Just break up and move on. 

You're not her father.

What are you going to do when you meet someone new? You're going to include your ex's child with your new family? Do you understand how unbelievably difficult that would be- not only emotionally but logistically. 

You assumed this risk when you started a relationship with someone with kids. 

That day is here. It's going to hurt like a bitch, but you need to leave.

Contact a lawyer and make a trust for Olivia. Let her know you are there if she needs you in an emergency but that you're not going to be around much anymore."
