OpiatesRecovery,fos6vx8,t3_g93tkb,1588025048.0,"Sorry for your loss. It‚Äôs incredibly heartbreaking and even more so with the current circumstances. Unfortunately, I lost a best friend the same exact way a few weeks ago and it has been tearing me up. We always said we would marry each other in the future and now I‚Äôll never be able to. I hope you are doing well. Please reach out if you need to talk. üíú Keep your head up."
antiMLM,fnisore,t1_fnisggr,1586985684.0,I‚Äôm about to respond this honestly lmfao. I‚Äôm a few days late but girl has gotta learn somehow üòâ
antiMLM,fnism5q,t1_fnishqt,1586985647.0,"Also how can I be a model for this brand but not promote anything? Makes no sense!

It‚Äôs even more insulting she thinks I would post this shit anywhere on my page."
teaching,fi1c05u,t1_fi1bqfb,1582054729.0,This is good. So should I change my policy to not accept classwork that the students do not work on in class? I try to get them to do it by making it due at the end of the period. He is also an athlete so maybe that will help. He is a ninth grader and comes from a rough background so I don‚Äôt know if calling home will even help but thank you!
stripper,fi17kh1,t1_fhzmmza,1582052204.0,I dont have a big ass so I probably wouldn‚Äôt do well there I assume ü§£
stripper,fhy3uxf,t1_fhwz8qe,1581968012.0,Thank you. I‚Äôm gonna try Rick‚Äôs or Scores. If admiral wants to be racist pieces of shit I don‚Äôt want anything to do with that disgusting behavior
teaching,fgmmf83,t1_fgmmcsi,1580927560.0,This makes me feel a little better not gonna lie. Thank you so much.
teaching,fgmihsa,t1_fgmiagz,1580925243.0,"Understandable and I appreciate the insight.

I do my best to keep on course with what the original teacher is doing though with added assignments. I‚Äôm not that much older than the kids I teach and when I was in school I wasn‚Äôt the best student but I had the decency to respect majority of my teachers or at least make the attempt. I‚Äôm doing my best to do what I have to do in order to graduate so I don‚Äôt even know."
teaching,fgmfkbd,t1_fgmfg37,1580923518.0,"ugh I‚Äôm glad somebody else feels this way. I just
don‚Äôt like being bullied essentially on a daily basis. I don‚Äôt know how to handle any of this"
STD,fesnb8k,t1_fesn2gp,1579367054.0,so i could have had the virus for a while and this is just the first time its showing??? is it worth it to get medicine from a doctor or just ride it out til its gone
TEFL,f7iv4ln,t1_f7ilyvm,1573766060.0,Is TEFL better to take online or in person? I read that someone said in person is better because online is starting to not count in some places. Thank you for your answer though! Very helpful.
heroin,f7ge50f,t3_dw2v5f,1573701366.0,STAY STRONG WE LOVE YOU!!!
TEFL,f7ftir4,t1_f7f3zbg,1573686372.0,May I ask what program you went through for teaching in China or how you found the school you worked for? I am highly considering it now instead of Japan and want to make sure I am looking at credible things.
heroin,f6xc8wh,t1_f5vnkit,1573246679.0,hi friend sorry i was MIA for a bit. hope you are well üíû
librarians,f1f88vl,t3_d95zpl,1569438847.0,Does anyone know if you can finish MLS online in a year? Or does it typically take 2?
BPD,f0l48vt,t3_d58jn5,1568697939.0,I‚Äôm so glad you wrote this. I have been struggling with this for so long and I feel like it legit ruins everything. I met a guy and he‚Äôs literally perfect for me. I told everyone about him and they agreed and I finally thought ‚Äúthis is what I deserve after being in a fucking toxic ass relationship for years!!‚Äù and we talked and talked and I was so excited and couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about us together. Well now fast forward I‚Äôm supposed to visit him this weekend and for some reason I‚Äôm coming up with random flaws or reasons to not pursue him like stupid shit like hes a year and a half younger than me. I‚Äôm so sick of it because I want to be happy and enjoy myself but I can‚Äôt stop trying to sabotage it???

sex,eyiznod,t3_cwbr6i,1567110024.0,I‚Äôm dealing with this right now. Literally don‚Äôt know who or how I got it but I went to my first apt to get them frozen off. They did not all go away and thats not uncommon so hopefully when I go back in about a week it will be my last treatment. Just do not itch or scratch or pick or shave over them because it will spread...and don‚Äôt touch it either and keep clothes clean thats what I have been doing!
StripperStories,eyawiyz,t1_eyawdrf,1566971289.0,Either works! I‚Äôll usually call them first though that way if they have a specific day they do auditions you‚Äôll know beforehand :)
StripperStories,eyafv51,t3_cwecua,1566962780.0,"Just be confident and go for it! Driving there and walking in is the hardest part. Scope out a few different clubs, talk to some people, and make a time to audition. It‚Äôs nowhere near as bad as you think. In my experience with the clubs I‚Äôve worked at I‚Äôve been hired on sight or do two songs. I feel like most just wanna see if you are a good fit, are comfortable up there taking top/clothes off, etc. If you don‚Äôt get hired try a different one. So go do it more power to you :)"
BPD,exu2l6p,t3_cudabn,1566578490.0,The same thing happened a month ago to me. Stay strong and really try to remember that you handled this well and what a great improvement is that you have made. It won‚Äôt be easy but go forward and take this time for you and focus on healing. Much love to you üñ§
