cats,fmiqxuh,t1_fmiq7i0,1586115114.0,"My almost 2 year old kitten does this still. I’m not sure why, but it’s not just at night it’s all throughout the day too when he comes in. Then he just lays in the dining room howling. Vets say he’s all okay but it worries me. His brother was hit by a car last year and passed away and I thought it was loneliness but we took in my mother in laws 7 year old cat when she passed and they get on fine. So I’m confused. Any tips? TIA"

Death is a horrible experience to go through. OP do what you think is the best decision for you. I hope the sun is shining bright for her. I wish you and your family well and my condolences"

I didn’t realise what I was doing at the time, it was only when he found out and said I was emotionally cheating that I realised I was. With a person whom I had a friendship for over 13 years and who I was asked to never talk to again. This happened after my partners mum sadly passed away, our kitten was killed a day after he turned one, one of the cats who belonged to his mum then passed away and my family cat at my parents passed away too. Those deaths happened in 21 days of each other and then 6 months later I ruin it all. Oh and to make it even fucking worse I was proposed to as well, just after my mother in law passed who had helped design the ring and the proposal was planned so that she could watch it. Sadly she passed away a few days before the proposal was meant to take place. 

See I really am nothing and worthless!"
