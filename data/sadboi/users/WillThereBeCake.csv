When the inevitable ""what are you shooting with?"" arose, she sheepishly belittling her equipment 'it's really old, I got it a long time ago to take pics of the babies, I want to get a better one...' all before identifying the camera but after beaming about the shots it had produced.

In your profession you are certainly aware of the inherent dangers of train transportation, and it's commendable that you're passing on that knowledge for others to become aware of and take into consideration. Thank you.

However, your paragraph could as easily refer to driving a vehicle across tracks legally and at specified crossings. There's always the possibility of a incident. So we maintain our vehicles, we don't intentionally stop on the tracks, we wait for the gate to rise,etc.

I witnessed a shoot on an active track 2 weeks ago. Closely grouped were the photographer, assistant and the model. Up the tracks on either side somewhere between 50 and 100 yards or so were watchers, intently looking in the direction any train would come from.  Impressive.

And then there's OP. an abandoned track no less. Point is that sometimes all the known, right steps have already been taken. Risk is everywhere, it's just that kind of planet. And yes, sometimes, with proper precautions, results are absolutely worth it.

It really is a good shot OP... Cheers
