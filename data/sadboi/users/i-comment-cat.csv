I have no idea how competitive boat clubs work in the US socially and practically, but I would guess they work similar to in the UK, where in head season everyone gets mixed up  loads. If you tell them, you run the risk of them telling the entire squad. Thankfully, I don't think that sounds like a big chance as I would guess you row in an eight with your two teammates, meaning that you probably have the respect of one another and have the ability to share this kind of thing together. I've told a few of my crewmates before (I am no longer an active rower but I'm in the same situation as you where I'm going to uni soon and considering taking up rowing again) and they generally have nothing but respect. Rowers can be really, really really over-competitive but the mark of a team that has gelled together well is one that can share secrets like that without it turning gnarly.

Firstly, I think that both El Primo and 8-BIT are competitively viable in Heist. Even if 8-BIT is incredibly slow, its turret alone is so strong at just dealing more damage. Not to mention how his tankiness + range + damage makes him able to take down other tanks, especially in maps with obvious lanes like Hot Potato (though admittedly there aren't a lot of lane-y maps atm). Primo is the tank that counters other tanks - that alone makes him viable in Heist; as well as Brawl Ball with his ability to capitalise on mistakes, as after all, we are assuming we're playing against human opponents that will give the smallest of opportunities that can then be used to snowball. 

I also think that you underestimate Crow as a jack of all trades. With his Gadget he changes from a master of none to a master of one - he now has the consistency in his aggro capabilities to make the plays he needs to make at the right times - i.e. he's viable in Brawl Ball, Bounty and Gem Grab."
