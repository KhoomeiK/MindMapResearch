06/12/19 - They promised you on a certain release date but there is a pandemic going on. They aren't the only one that is low on inventory. And the idea that you should get special treatment because you pre order a year earlier give me a break.

04/10/20 - It hasn't shipped. When I ordered FF15 and i didn't get it on streat date Amazon next day me another copy. I ended up with two copies that I could keep. Amazon has some of the most lax return policies as well. When this hasn't shipped you should have tried to secure another copy and just return it to Amazon when it came. I have done this several times, when i wanted to play a game Day 1. I just go to the store and get a copy and return Amazon. Yes Amazon should meet street date but shit happens. 

04/14/20 - Packaged Damaged, Return it case closed.

Honestly I don't care that much, but I have free time. Honestly Amazon shouldn't have sent any games and prioritize essential items.
