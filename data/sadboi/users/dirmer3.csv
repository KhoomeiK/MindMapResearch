outdoorgrowing,fpu8y52,t3_gfbg8w,1588907271.0,"I'm all about keeping it simple. Especially for new growers. It isn't rocket science and you're best off just learning the fundamentals of growing a plant as opposed to trying various experiments right off the bat.

1. If it's a rooted clone, you can transplant it into its final pot any time you want.


2. That soil sounds fine. You wont need fertilizer at first, but you will eventually. Keep it simple and just go organic. You can probably get some kind of pelleted fertilizer and just sprinkle in top and water. I don't advise getting in to some multi part liquid nutrient system with a schedule to follow and water to PH or whatever. Keep it simple!


3. Just put them outside during the day and bring them in at night. That's the easiest way. Start in the shade first and introduce them to full sun gradually.


4. I'd say no, don't fuck with it. Just let the plant grow as it was meant to. Way less room for error. Plenty of time to learn different techniques once you've mastered the basics.


5. It does depend on your tap water, I suppose. But if you can water plants in your garden with the hose without killing them, it's probably fine. I never worry about dechlorinating my water or anything and I grow amazing plants.    There is no reason to complicate this. More importantly, water appropriately. Only when the soil is dry on the top couple inches. Watering too often is far more deadly than not watering often enough.


6. It's hard to say exactly what happened to that leaf, but it doesn't matter. You want to concern yourself over overall plant health and not micromanage every leaf.


Another word of wisdom. Bigger pot, bigger plant. If you want a small plant, go with your 10 gallon pots. If you want bigger plants, you need bigger pots.


If you have any other questions, I'm happy to help."

I have what's called a sport pilot's license. Instead of an FAA medical certificate, you just need to hold a driver's license. There are just a lot of limitations on what kind of planes you can fly -no cessna 172 or what have you, only 2 seats, you can only fly in the day, etc. That said, it only requires 20 hours min to get the license vs. 40 for private pilot. It was just really nice for me to finally get to say I'm a pilot.


To scratch the itch, I do a lot of flight simming in x-plane. I could easily go jump into a cessna citation II and fly us IFR to our destination. So I have a lot of the working knowledge of a pilot, but just no licensure. I even use pilot edge to have real simulated ATC. Best I'm gunna get."
