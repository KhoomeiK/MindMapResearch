Which I've done.  I journal nightly.  My attempts have failed.

>There is CLEAR reasearch as to why therapy actually works for some people, and why psychoanalysis works. If you think you're dismantling my argument by observing my ""bias"", i would like to remind you that we both have bias, and i have been, and am openly admitting to my bias. Because guess what, bias isn't inherently something bad. I'm biased towards therapy simply because it's been shown to work, is built on scientific principles, and has lots of evidence backing it - do you have any alternatives as to the suggestions i'm providing? 

There's also scientific backing that a proportion of people are harmed/will get worse and another who don't notice a change.  I've tried therapy for over a decade - I used to be like you.  And no. I don't have an alternative - which is why I want to die.

>eventhough i know you actually believe that you've ""already exhausted every alternative"", i very much doubt this. 

I have. I tried exercises, already tried insights, taught myself coping strategies, changed my diet and sleep, took vitamins, read a ton of self help book, tried medication, and more medication, went through therapy books with a friend, tracked my symptoms, went to alternative therapies, meditation, repeatedly called the crisis line for ideas and asked my previous therapist if there was anything else I could do.

The ""when done well"" part though is a bit of a cop out as very few therapists will admit to being/think they are a ""bad"" therapist.  A good amount of people benefit from therapy, however there is also scientific evidence that a proportion of patients are harmed by therapy and another proportion don't notice any difference.  Which, I accept and expect as medical treatments aren't a perfect process.   

What wasn't okay was that I (as a client) was not informed of this risk beforehand. Therapy was (and is) peddled as something that was all beneficial while turning a blind eye to any realistic faults/drawbacks (Instead of it will ""bring up 'bad' stuff/feelings and you'll have to face past traumas/problems"").  That's where therapy for me became toxic and unhealthy.  Most therapists could not believe that their techniques did not work. Some could not believe that whatever they used had any drawbacks. Had I been informed I would have at least been able to mitigate the harm it did and not gamble on it working instead of running around in circles and repeatedly trying the same things expecting a different result. 

Self help books were cheaper, more informative/had better insights and had far less risk - if it didn't work, I could just move onto the next thing instead of being blamed, told to ""try again"" and  gaslighted (not intentionally but being told said therapeutic treatment didn't work because I didn't believe in it/tracked my symptoms fits the definition)."
