It's VERY important to find a therapist who is non judgmental and really tries to understand. Most will be happy to do a free consult over the phone (sometimes even in person) which will allow you to ask questions and get a general sense of how they operate. There is no shame in therapy, and no one should have to wait until rock bottom to seek it. 

As far as medication I can't say much. Took prozac very briefly before I stopped because of the side effects. Made me jittery af and i could barely sleep. Of course, everyone responds differently though"
