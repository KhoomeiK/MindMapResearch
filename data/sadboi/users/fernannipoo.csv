Lifting is a skill. It can take years for some people to be able to build their mind muscle connection to their optimal level to get the gainz they’re looking for.

The first two are pretty self-explanatory. Tai chi enabled me to feel the energy running through my body. 

With exercise I focused on blood flow. 
Therefore I tried to release any tension I had in my joints and ligaments. This took months, still a work in progress.
