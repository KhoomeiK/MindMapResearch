BipolarReddit,fjfe4ok,t3_fd3ygf,1583289912.0,"I am explaining all of the time to my very non emotional girlfriend, who doesn’t verbally communicate what she is feeling basically 95% of the time. She shows in other ways, not the point. However I’m constantly trying to make it make sense that I can feel every emotion I have. They are full body sensations and have their own individual feelings from light static in my toes when I am happy or excited and the slight flutter of my heart, the head space. And the deep curls I feel instinctively in my bones and the heat that I feel travels through my lungs and chest when I am angry.

Needless to say she doesn’t get it lol. But you’re not alone!

Edited bc I’m dumb lol"

BipolarReddit,fjdlosc,t3_fcv8un,1583254969.0,"I’m sorry you experienced this and I hope this doesn’t hurt your progress any farther. However you seem to know how it happened and everything that contributed to it, so in that way I’m happy for you. I’m also bipolar 1, struggle with alcohol, I got drunk last weekend and got violent with my girlfriend. She has forgiven me but I think sobriety is best. 

You’ve got a friend in this bipolar and sober journey if you ever need one! All the best"
BipolarReddit,fjd2y52,t1_fjc1h6u,1583244365.0,Thank you. I didn’t even know a sliding scale therapist was a thing

Im sorry this happened!"
