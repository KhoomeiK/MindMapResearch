I've dated all the water signs and cancers got the stuff we caps have a deficit in, and it's the same for them too!

Cancers are nurturing, sweet, emotional, caring, and introverted. They seek safety and stability.

Capricorns are more stern, rational, and focused. We are nurturing but in a different way. We are so focused on developing a solid foundation that these crabs are attracted to our stable nature.

Cancers create this cozy ""home"" that when we are together helps caps recharge so we are more available and secure.

detrans,fobs7x9,t1_fob25sv,1587663102.0,"Thank you for sharing that! I am just a creeper here, I am a lesbian whom had a lot of trans friends. One day I came across a vlogger on YT who was really struggling with detransition. Going back and forth...

I am also a mental health professional. I have noticed most kids who identify as trans tend to have a lot of conflict at home, or they may suffer a mental illness. Healthcare professionals have been duped into thinking trans people need transition,  not mental health care. Ive worked with kids who were being abused and that wasn't investigated cause the symptoms of their abuse were translated as symptoms of being transgender.

I bring this up because so many young folks here feel ashamed like they made a terrible choice for their lives. You did not make this decision alone. You were part of an incredibly flawed health care and mental health system that encouraged you to transition rather than focus on other aspects of your wellness. We must put a stop to this as more and more young people are becoming victims of this misguided agenda.

You are going to see that your voice is very important in helping others. There is a whole generation of kids who's sexuality and puberty have been medicalized. You are a surviver. I can't imagine going through all of this, but I whole heartedly believe you can overcome it.

Kalvin Garrah who is a transman has done some interviews with people who has detransitioned. Another thing about the stats... Transitioning has only been mainstream for a few years, so just wait 5 years and see how many people are going to be talking about how transitioning ruined their lives because, or at least created some irreversible changes and longterm health issues that nobody informed them about. Most people on HRT right now are under 25, we see many others who desisted. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bEdZVAHA00
Here is an interview of two transmen speaking with a woman who completely transitioned including a phalloplasty and regretted it. Was totally convinced they were trans, even from a young age. 

I don't know how old you are but that really plays a massive factor. I just hate to see a young person make a permanent change for something that really seems to be a fad. Samples of young people show 70% higher prevalence of trans than there should be given empirical research.

ptsd,ffvbso1,t1_ffv9gjp,1580260414.0,"With all due respect, what you have said is completely counter to the post you have made. 

The title of your post implies like you believe coming out as trans to yourself is related to a reduction of flashbacks. That tells me right there that on some level you have identified this as a solution for your mental health issues relating to PTSD. You may not feel comfortable with the idea of avoiding victimhood by changing your gender, but even before gender the idea of changing your identity would be very attractive. 

I have worked with LGBTQ youth as a mental health professional and we used to advocate people to explore their identity, but I do see people over-simplifying the concept of gender as a means to fix a problem. I am glad you are taking this slow because the consensus as of late has been to fast track people to transition. Dysphoria is a loaded term, the majority of people particularly young people, particularly young women don't like their bodies. That is why anorexia is such an issue for girls, moreso than boys even. 

One does not overcome PTSD by being ""comfortable with their gender expression."" Its about evaluating triggers and using therapy to help retrain your brain so you can reduce the distress. I am not sure if your primary issue related to being trans or having PTSD. But I wrote here because many people who transition that also have trauma find later that a transidentity was maladaptive coping."

The fact is trans people only make up <1% of the population, and current youth samples of trans-people shows like a 70% higher prevalence in trans identity than would be typical for statistics. A lot of people feel the way you do, but they are not transgender. It is a maladaptive coping. Check out r/detrans because I have seen people with a story like yours whom come out later regretting their transition because the anxiety, depression and trauma were actually what caused their issues. It is best to put your health and mental health first. If you are trans you will feel the same way about your gender after thorough support to help your ptsd.

The Cass can be progressive and regressive. For instance, a person could be out in one community and locate or another where safety is a concern because of the culture.   
Human beings are very diverse and that applies to different expectations and norms.   


For something like stonewall; I think this model is more individualistic. But even the model recognizes the fact that people are drawn to their own communities, so if they all happen to be experiencing a Pride stage simultaneously you could see that group becoming collected. But then things really become more about group dynamics/mob mentality from there, which would be exactly what happened.

That's just it. Men are not entitled to having women in their lives or spaces. It really is a privilege because we are being capable of making choices, and sometimes it excludes men.   


I recently started working out at a new gym that has a woman's only space. I have never had a problem working out with men around, but I must say being in that space was a very positive experience! I do the majority of my workouts in there. I seem to workout a lot harder there too."

When I was overseeing an LGBTQ+ program for community and youth, I recognized most professionals and organizations are fine. They don't regard gender and sexuality issues as their primary concern, because its not. Be careful to not over generalize the experience of all LGB people, because it really does matter where you are from. 

I suppose my specific example of right wingers and LGB coming together would be like the Heritage Foundation allowing Julia Beck to speak on these issues.

Add the air of aquarius and you have a resilient, intelligent, and secretly sensitive critter capable of surviving the cold cold seasons and enjoying the warmth of the high summers... Ohh I do love my sign"

psychotherapy,f5vkl02,t3_dpdjp8,1572491640.0,"One of the key aspects of a successful group is a feeling of safety. There is already power dynamics present that would have the youth hesitant to share with their parents. After all, they don't have any reason to believe that what they disclose may be held against them later, perhaps its even embarrassing. I would really emphasize some ground rules about everyone being equal in this setting. You could do an ice breaker activity at the beginning of the session to encourage this. At the end of the day each person is a member of the family which means they do have equal importance because without each other they wouldn't be a complete family.   


If it is hard to get people to open up and there are significant themes in presenting scenarios for these families I would recommend starting the first sessions outlining why people come to your group and how it has benefited them, what kind of topics they covered. This can break the happy-family stereotype and let them know there are other people out there just like them with the same struggles. There is a lot of shame that people feel being involved in a group like this. And you are the person who is the so-called expert that has them under a microscope. My practice always follows the Rogerian concept of the unconditional positive regard aka no judgement. We all struggle with these things from time to time. Its very Brene Brown, the power of vulnerability. You will never see progress in your groups without it. Because a lack of vulnerability means there is a wall and the wall is defensiveness. The longer we wait to call out the wall and create a bridge the more defensive and avoidant your participants will be.    


I also recommend bringing them their favourite treat occasionally if it is an option."

GenderCritical,f5qjrha,t3_doozsr,1572378222.0,"Pre puberty. I remember not wanting to be a girl because girls weren't treated well and being a girl implied I needed to be a certain way. Thank God I turned out to be a lesbian, I live a different kind of path as a woman because I can define the kind of woman I am. But there are still challenges. Being more masculine has pros and cons. I think I do better in my career but I'm also judged more harshly socially for not fitting into a sexual stereotype. Being a woman is basically having to face stereotypes everyday. But giving yourself permission to be yourself totally makes it better no matter what kind of woman you are."
