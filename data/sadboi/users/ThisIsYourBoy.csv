depression,fj4p810,t3_fbi7gc,1583013581.0,"I feel the same way! My memory is absolutely terrible, maybe not as severe as you but that may be the result of recently switching meds. But yeah I go watch a movie with my friends and when we try to talk about it I’ve pretty much forgotten 70% of what I just saw. It’s actually kind of scary."
BipolarReddit,fj4onmd,t1_fj4it96,1583013189.0,I think that over expressing yourself creatively is a good thing. Some of the best films and songs are full and honest expressions of how one feels. I’d separate social expressions from creative expressions.
BipolarReddit,fj4o5sl,t3_fbggu7,1583012850.0,"I kept it to myself for the longest time because I was afraid of the stigma. About a year ago I started letting some of my closer friends know when the opportunity came up, usually after a few drinks. It made me feel better knowing that some people knew what I was going through and it relieved some of my notion of stigma. But I sometimes wish I kept it more to myself not because of the stigma but because it is kind of personal. I don’t want people feeling sorry for me.

It’s tricky because hiding the disorder can really make things worse. It’s important to share to people who care about you. At the same time some details could’ve stayed private."
depression,fj4fbl5,t1_fj3nlg8,1583006944.0,No I got what you were saying. Thanks for the response! It was very helpful.
depression,fj2gb4g,t1_fj217wt,1582942937.0,"Well I don’t have any of those but I’d like to think I’m polite, nice and caring. Hope that’s enough."
BipolarReddit,fj1ffc0,t1_fiwzz8e,1582918942.0,Hey thanks for the advice.
depression,fizmnij,t1_fiyymf2,1582867143.0,"I feel the same way and I’m still quite young, 24. It’s funny the only advice I get is “you’re still young you have your whole life ahead of you”. But that doesn’t help."
depression,fizmf09,t3_faluc3,1582866937.0,"I’m turning 24 soon and I already feel like my best days are behind me. Everything is boring, I spend most my time alone and I have no real hope for my future. The last time I had real fun was in high school before I became depressed and cared about what others think of me. Idk maybe it’s just the depression filling our minds with these thoughts. The only thing that kind of helps is trying to convince myself that age is arbitrary, although they may not even be true. Just trying to find hope that I ’ll experience fulfillment again is the only thing I can do right now. 

I’m still young and I don’t want to waste my years like this. I already wasted 5 years of my life alone, depressed and stuck on the couch without any new experiences. The depression makes it harder for me to go out and enjoy life but the more I stay stagnant the more difficult it gets to get out of this rut."

Sexual preference is not necessarily sexual. Understanding who you are is important and if coming out at a young age helps more power to them.

I have a gay brother and he knew he was gay since he was a child. This has nothing to do with the age of consent, it’s about understanding how one feels."
AskReddit,fizbyur,t3_faaznw,1582859015.0,A lot of loved ones would be lost as well as a lot of wisdom and knowledge.
changemyview,fizbqhi,t3_fak64e,1582858856.0,"Ooooooh this is a good point. I do think that this discrimination towards felons is a major issue. How can you expect criminals to not end up back in prison if they can’t get a job or re-assimilate back into society because of the social stigma against former criminals. However, I do think that employers should know whether or not they are hiring someone with a criminal background. I honestly don’t know, it’s a tricky one."
AskReddit,fiz9mss,t1_fiy1neb,1582857409.0,YEEEESSSS
BipolarReddit,fiz9ip3,t1_fiyvvmq,1582857333.0,I work outdoors and often don’t have time to leave my post so I have to take my pills publicly. I hate it.
depression,fivghgt,t3_f9tiy2,1582759869.0,I am exactly the same way. First of all you’re not a waste of space and you are a normal person. It’s incredibly frustrating to feel this way and I too am incredibly jealous of those who can socialize with ease. I don’t know a magic cure but I do know that you’re not alone.
depression,fivfpkr,t3_f9vvsc,1582759498.0,"I can almost guarantee that what you may have done does not require that kind of response from your mother. Loving your parents can be difficult especially if they treat you this way. I would recommend avoiding this kind of toxic behaviour from your parents as much as possible. Hopefully you can find love and respect outside your home. 

You can’t control your parents, but you deserve a lot better than that. No one deserves that."
depression,five7g3,t3_f9xxtd,1582758750.0,Every time I start feeling better I rarely enjoy it because I know that very soon this feeling will end.
BipolarReddit,fgv1mia,t3_f0g2ja,1581134612.0,"I’m in the exact same situation right now and I don’t really know what to do. All I can say, is to take things one step at a time. There is no possible way to wrap your head around everything that is happening at the moment. I tend to try and plan out the rest of my life and overwhelm myself with the amount of changes required to do so. I try to understand that you cannot plan out your entire life in a matter of minutes  hours or even days. Take one step at a time and try to find pride in any of the changes you make.
You’re not alone, and I hope this helps."
