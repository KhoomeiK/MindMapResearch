Gross. Not the asshole.

 Edit: I don't know why I'm being down voted for saying the girlfriend should have kept it to herself. Having breasts doesn't mean other people get to comment.

I'm just saying I get the impulse, it's in a common space, people are curious. I  think the biggest issue is the girlfriend trying to shame her roommate for normal behaviour.

Double edit: I know no one is probably reading this anymore bc it's hidden due to downvotes but downvotes are supposed to be for comments that are not germane to the topic. The q was asked: Aita?

A can of adequate tomato sauce at least 3. I know neither of these items are a meal itself, but to mind it's a microcosm of the issues at play with food.

Unhealthy food is ready made and processed to shit. Because it's made in huge quantities and subsidized as an industry, the prices are low. Eating ""right"" takes a lot more time energy and thought that buying what looks good, tastes good, or is inexpensive.

ABraThatFits,fpwckfl,t1_fpuweis,1588961065.0,"So if you choose this path, you'd need some specialty materials ( not hard but can take time to assemble - elastic, rings and sliders, hooks, channeling for underside, underwire) back when stores were open you could just go and get em. I have a shoe box with a variety of fabrics and a few underwires, a couple options of hardware. This [love to sew podcasts episode on bra making](https://lovetosewpodcast.com/episodes/episode-53-bra-making-with-emerald-erin/) convinced me it was possible to make these on my own. You can make several bras out of a 1/2 yard of fabric, you don't need much! 

Emerald erin and also foundations revealed (another Redditor linked to them in a reply to my last post) do a really good job explaining bra drafting and the process if you wanted to make you own from scratch, or adjust an existing pattern. Orange lingerie is another pattern company making lingerie designs for home sewing... id recommend listening to that podcast and checking out foundations revealed and EE to see if it's something you might want to spend some time figuring out. There's definitely a learning curve but once you got it sorted, it's pretty straight forward. 

It's it's own whole thing so it's not a quick fix. But it's really empowering. I usually cut the pieces and then match them while I watch tv pinning or basting. Then I'll run them through the machine. Then back to the tv to match the next set of seams. Over about a week I can get through all the steps. (It's slower when you start). And it all fits in a sandwich sized ziplock bag.  Definitely a journey of education and self sufficiency!

Edit: I called foundations revealed the wrong thing"

ABraThatFits,fpuuw4z,t3_gfn7f1,1588924536.0,"So, maybe an unpopular opinion, but, is the problem that she buys your bras? Because frankly it's none of her business. I mean until you get a bra that fits she thinks you're a liar or a fabulator (is that a word? Fabricating stories) and after you get a bra that fits you show her the label. If she wants you to explain it you do.if she insists on disbeleiving, tough titties. It's ok for someone else to not believe you. You need to define the boundary: ""I did hours of research and measured myself (and I do know more than you). I'm not talking to you about this until you're ready to take me seriously. And then don't. You don't need to put up with someone calling you a liar and belittling you over something so trivial. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Also this may be way out there but if you want to talk about making bras, I know a few things (not an expert)+ can share some resources. If you have a sewing machine already its not too hard. Fit can still be a bit of a journey but again, resources. They don't take a lot of fabric, the pieces are small and truly they're way  cheaper to make once you have a pattern that fits.

I didn't get a prescription right away, but did soon after. My situation was different, I'm not sure if they'd prescribe right away. Calling couldn't hurt. 

 The ER is a bit of a process, but you skip the wait list. Say if you were referred by your GP, you'd probably have to wait several weeks to see anyone at CAMH. They're a lot more responsive thru the ER. 

I'm also thinking CAMH is good because they do offer follow up in a way that a walk in doc couldn't. My guess is that walk ins wouldn't prescribe lorazepam, may be hesitant to prescribe an ssri, BC of you need follow ups and all that.

stationary,feh5xuv,t3_ep3g3n,1579109824.0,"I work at an art supply store, and from the stock we have where I work, I'd recommend either le pen with the brush tip or a synthetic brush pen with bristles, kuretake brand or the pentel pocket brush) for example.

As far as I can tell. Most brands that use water based ink will use felt tips. Felt frays with use. You could try the Faber castell brush markers.. but they're felt too but the tips are smaller so maybe they'd be less noticeable to the finished product. They are also water proof unlike the tombow markers. (Also, staedtler makes a 'mars' version of the tombows you may want to try) 

Alcohol markers with brushes (think copics) could be what you're looking for, they use a flexy foam brush tip, but the ink bleeds ( grows on the page) as you apply them, and the ink will seep through the other side ( because of the alcohol). So if you're drawing and colouring with them, they'll be fine, but if you want to ,say write in a note book, they're not a great choice, you'll see em on the other side of the page.

The le pen brush pens use a weird flexy plastic of some kind so they shouldn't fray and are water based, so they won't leak through the other side. That said, they have small tips. So it's not really a replacement per se, they're more an alternative that won't fray... The kuretakes are nylon bristle markers that are like a brush, they are water based and will spread like a brush when you press down. Very different mechanism than the felt tips.

I'd definitely recommend visiting a shop near you and telling them what you're looking for specifically. (Won't bleed, fray resistance, what kind of paper you use etc) and see what they recommend. Also, bring your pad or book and test some of em on the material you're actually using. Lastly, sometimes you gotta ignore the fray and accept the limitations of the materials, or just try a bunch of things till you find what you like. There's a reason people are intense about their fav stationary and art materials!  

Good luck!"

Or maybe a circle punch that you turn over to see how far you've pushed in to the page? Circular punches are easier to find.

Edit to say good luck!"

I put a little sticker on mine to to distinguish from the other presto card I bought when I forgot mine. Like, it's mine, I have systems. What's the problem. 

If I were you I'd make sure my presto account and my card were connected if they weren't already. if a aggressive driver decided to confiscate the card, who knows where it goes. I'd want to make sure I don't lose my balance.

 I guess it would also be a best practise to not cover the presto logo, like apply your sticker to the back side to try to avoid zealots like this guy. At least it would still be obvious what it is (even though it makes literally no difference)"
ABraThatFits,faljs30,t1_fakta84,1576185538.0,"Aha! That's a pretty compelling reason not to try it right away! 

Good luck on your search for a bra that fits!!"
ABraThatFits,fakq93e,t1_faiz8ws,1576171358.0,"I'd recommend you try one of the calculators suggested size as measured with the tape measure. 

The new size assumes a smaller frame with the same breast volume. I'm no abrathatfits expert, but I did have luck personally getting a bra with a smaller snugger band. It also sits further down my torso and shifts a lot less. 

Ymmv, if it really doesn't fit, leave it! But give it a try to at least rule it out. Bras are hard!

PCOSloseit,f9lvulf,t3_e5t44d,1575433405.0,"First of all, I'm sorry to hear that you've been struggling! Being sick can be so stressful. My advice is to get a pat answer down and repeat it every time. Oh you asked a question I don't want to answer, I will answer the question you didn't ask but that I feel more comfortable answering.

Say something to affirming their question/ interpret their ask kindly, ""yes I have lost some weight"", say something to indicate the cause, update on your status, and close the topic. ""Its kind of come as a surprise to me actually, I'm ok, but I'd rather not discuss it."" Full stop, change the topic. It may seem a little brusque, but, they asked, and you're answering, being honest, and asserting your boundaries. 

People are curious about what's going on with you. Your co-workers may have lost weight themselves at some point or may have their own stories about people in their lives transforming their bodies on purpose. They might assume you have been working on it and want to share in your victory! It makes sense, but in this case, it's not welcome! Just let them know. I'm sure if they pushed on and later found out it was difficult topic for you they'd wish they hadn't brought it up.

After some difficult family circumstances I failed to get a pat answer down, and every time a question about my family came up in conversation, I was kind of triggered and anxious, and sad and stumbled over my words. Hopefully you can head that off at the pass. Good luck :)"

I haven't ever taken cymbalta but I do have a little experience with depression/long term anti anxiety meds and they usually take a few days to a week or two to work fully. I felt mine pretty quickly but didn't fully kick in for a little while. 

If I was in a similar situation, I'd try to lean on the supportive people in my life a bit. I'd probably call just to chat, or try to see some people I love and get some hugs. Take it easy, try to alleviate some of the anxiety. After 5-10 days if it didn't start getting better or if it got worse, I'd go back to the doctor. 

Sounds like you're going through something. It's not gonna be easy, but keep with it. I'm rooting for you. ‚äÇ(¬¥ÔΩ•‚ó°ÔΩ•‚äÇ )‚àòÀöÀ≥¬∞"

It's about how to take care of yourself when you are stressed. It's more of a long term look at stress and anxiety responses, so it won't help you at your worst, but hopefully could help you be more even on an ongoing basis!?

I found it very helpful. I love the show, I hope someone else can also be helped by it.

If you put something in early, it's going to mellow significantly as it continues to cook. If you add more in the middle of the cooking time and then again near the end or as a garnish, you're going to get all those mellow sweet notes as well as the fresher, brighter notes of the fresher herbs.

When I make aglie et olio, I do half the garlic at the beginning and half the garlic RIGHT best the end. I want The garlic to be sharp but not spicy, as well as mellow and sweet to add complexity to the dish.
