Anxiety,fmf6v5m,t3_fuitq4,1586021124.0,"If it gets worse and you have breathing difficulties even when resting, it feels like you might need to call the hospital or something, if you decide you do not need to, take care, okay? All you can do is your best, don't go near your mom or touch her stuff etc, sleep enough and drink enough, maybe immune boosting tea"

Anxiety,fjjies6,t3_fdn0s2,1583397521.0,"Thing is you need to find the balance. Right now best thing might be to take a rest from all anxiety, find a comfort zone in your home, and when you are ready, push yourself a little, but keep yourself on the ""right"" side. You must know when you should not try to keep everything non anxious, and push, and when you are pushing too hard and need to rest. Because if you do that, it will be easier and easier to do things that give you great anxiety."

AskReddit,fbgi9d2,t3_ed3gju,1576850222.0,"Totally. I would bring:
School books for the rest of the year
All maths books I can get my hand on
Rubik's cubes
Printed out papers of quicker rubik's cube algorithms
Some Learn Japanese books
Pens and paper
Light reading

Aand then I'd read all the school books I wouldn't have to study much more that year and do maths and learn to solve the rubik's cube real fast and if I got time over I could even study Japanese and sign language. And if I got tired I could always read fantasy books or draw.
And think about life. :p"
