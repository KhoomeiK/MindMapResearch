AskReddit,fk6wpaj,t1_fk61ggu,1583919536.0,"I’m am NOT justifying - but this injustice, torment or call it whatever you want is how and why people snap and do collateral harm/damage.

Serial killers, mass murders and such - it’s like blowing and blowing and blowing up a balloon that’s just can take an restricted amount of air, but we keep blowing and blowing til it suddenly snaps on our face.

That’s just what bullied children/teenagers do to survive and make it to stop - they hit til the bully gets his/her face complete crushed, they stab or use a bat or any tool, and shootings.


People who do such are NOT justified - but us who do torment them are and should NOT get justified or “but we just used words we never took it out physically” EITHER. 

Words do harm as much as physical harm does. We should always think how we tread people!"
