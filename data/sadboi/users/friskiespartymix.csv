depression,fqcyc52,t1_fppkbib,1589273160.0,"Thank you for this comment! I have only just seen it now. I actually volunteered to walk neighbourhood dogs a little while before the lockdown started, and did some dogsitting too. I loved that a lot so I expect I'll do it more once restrictions have lifted a bit more.

I think I have the problem of not feeling like I am good at anything. Like I have always wanted to help people but I find human interaction really hard, especially if it is one person after another from my customer service experience. I think if I got to work with fewer people and could create deeper connections it would be ok though. 

Before the lockdown I was also having some fun rehearsing for a show, and I have an audition for another show in just under a month. Performing in shows is a lot of fun for me. I've also put in my interest to volunteer for an organisation that supports young people with disabilities to perform too. I think I will feel a bit better if I get to do all that, once life goes back to being a little more normal and I get to keep trying to pursue things that make me happier and healthier. 

I'm so glad to hear you are in a better place now and doing something that makes you happy. I hope that it continues for you."
depression,fptmy1t,t1_fpri3na,1588894285.0,Would be easier to be able to just disappear right? Guess the missing person thing is also tough on family. It's a strange feeling not wanting to hurt them by dying but also not wanting to burden them by living.
afterlifenetflix,fpr49ic,t1_fpabpib,1588841832.0,"Yeah I think I am going to just skip his parts. I keep getting infuriated as I am pulled out of the sweetness of the rest of the story. I get having some strange characters, but there is no way a person like that would ever be a therapist."
depression,fpqik80,t3_gexz2t,1588823616.0,"I really hope things get better for you! I am a bit older than you are now and my life I think very slowly started spiraling downwards when I was your age, and it didn't really get to rock bottom where I wanted to totally give up on life until I think about 2017/2018 when I would have been about 29. Have you tried different sorts of therapy? There are so many different styles out there. I haven't found therapy works for me, though an old friend of mine recommended something called acceptance and commitment therapy to me last night and said it is brilliant for the power we give to the internal language we use. Sounds great to me as my negative self talk is just so bad. So I have contacted the only therapist I can see in my area that does that sort of therapy to give it a go. Just when we think all hope is lost, sometimes we can find a glimmer again. I have my doubts about it working, but I want to try anything to makes things better really. Hopefully you can find what works for you too!"
depression,fpqhohj,t3_gendho,1588823034.0,"Yes so bad. The thought even crossed my mind of wondering if I could hire someone to kill me haha. I found a random lump on my breast the other week, it is nothing, but the thought crossed my mind that hmm, maybe that's fine if it is cancer. I'm fine with that. I mean I'd rather die quickly, but either way, dying is fine. Would just make it easier for everyone in the long run. Ah well. No cancer for me that I am aware of yet."
depression,fpq41ol,t1_fpo67ad,1588814737.0,False sense of security is better than no sense of security in some ways. Although yeah I'd be cursing this higher power at the moment for sending me a live hedgehog filled with maggots last week to be honest. That reinforced my belief that there is no god. Or if there is they are awful for allowing such awful things to happen and I hate them. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
depression,fppl9qo,t1_fpnt7md,1588804375.0,I'm so sorry to hear you feel that way too. Wouldn't wish that on anyone. It's so hard to get out of that way of thinking though ‚òπÔ∏è
depression,fppkqgi,t1_fpp8hu6,1588804085.0,"We hardly ever arrange to hang out, and live in different cities now haha. But yeah when we do hang out in person it's awesome."
depression,fpngg4y,t1_fpng2i8,1588762035.0,"Yeah I think in other roles I had I was aiming for a higher position, but then I realised basically all the positions in that company required at least some customer service, and the ones that didn't required some experience and knowledge from outside of the company. I really hope I hear back from at least one of the jobs I have applied for. I'm worried that no one will want me though since I haven't had a full time job since September and my last two full time jobs I didn't last at for longer than 6 months.. looks bad."
depression,fpn8n8x,t1_fpmu49j,1588754062.0,"Wow nice! Yeah my one interest was singing but I realised I wasn't actually ever going to be a fantastic singer a bit late. I wasn't really good at any other form of music, I tried and failed to play the piano several times. I just lack commitment to anything! Perhaps it was partly my family saying to me ""that's nice but what are you going to do with that"" when I did my qualifications. I just feel like a massive failure. I have done customer service roles for a while and I feel like I can't do that anymore. I have just been trying to apply for a job that would involve customer service and it sounds a little like an old job I had and its making my eyes brim with tears just to think of going back to that.. Honestly I feel like life is too hard and crap and filled with too much stuff that I hate. Perhaps if people were nicer to each other customer service wouldn't feel so bad."
depression,fpmt2yv,t1_fpmmll3,1588740984.0,"Yeah you are right. I try not to take the no responses to my messages personally too, as he has told me he does that to everyone. His partner is the same. I message each of them and don't get a response for at least a few days. Sucks when you feel like you need someone to listen to you right now. But at the same time I really don't want to throw all my crap at him all the time haha. It's just because he feels like one of the few people who will respond to me (when he gets around to it) in a way that I want to hear and doesn't make me sad or angry I think. I try to show my appreciation for that when I can though. But I definitely do need to remember to ask him about how he's doing instead of assuming he will just tell me if he wants to talk."
depression,fpmsj24,t1_fpmlibj,1588740564.0,Thank you. I actually have no belief in a god. I think if I did I would be really angry with them for a number of reasons! But sometimes I do think if I believed in a higher being maybe I would be happier.
depression,fpmlgq0,t3_gea6mo,1588735706.0,I have a best friend but he has probably about 5 people who are more of a best friend than I am... So 6th best friend... yay? He hardly ever responds to my messages too. Fair enough. I am most often complaining to him about something.
depression_help,fhrzctp,t3_f4jbk1,1581846022.0,"Oh gosh I'm 31 and my mum helped me to clean my room today because I had left it for so long and it felt too hard. I didn't want her to help, but by accepting her help it made it so much easier. Do you have anyone who would be willing to help you and do it with you? Then you can get the sense of accomplishment because you did it but it was also more manageable because of help."
depression_help,fehebpp,t1_fehd0id,1579114784.0,"Nahh definitely not. I'm not sure if you are male or female, doesn't matter really, but I've had a number of guys attracted to my bigger body. It's really all in my head that it's not good enough. But I know I need to improve it for my health either way."
depression_help,fef3sma,t1_fef1qky,1579047504.0,"What do you do when you get home from work? Watch TV? Perhaps just lift a few weights while watching TV. Also, and this is easier said than done, you need to love yourself in your own body. People are drawn to confidence, and many people love a bigger body. Weight loss should be for health over wanting others to love you. I'm sure you are plenty loveable the way you are! When you love yourself others will love you too. I am such a hypocrite because I also feel like no one will love me while I'm big, but I know that is really wrong to think that way deep down."
depression_help,feerfae,t3_eorrrl,1579039609.0,"Weight loss is something like 80% diet and 20% exercise. I currently don't work much due to my depression and I'm lucky enough to see a reasonably priced personal trainer 4 times a week who I've also just received a meal plan from starting this week. Hoping to see some changes eventually! But anyway, if you're too tired for exercise, try changing your diet, maybe look to see a dietitian if you can afford it and get a meal plan to help you make better eating choices. You may even gain some energy to exercise from changing your eating too! Good luck, you'll get there!"
depression_help,fbeyezt,t3_eclwb9,1576796946.0,My cat helps to keep me going. Lovely kitty
depression_help,f8r0q08,t3_e1jl2i,1574729037.0,I go to a personal trainer. Luckily she doesn't charge an insane amount compared to most! She's awesome and pushes me to do what I am capable of doing but would never do by myself. I feel so good afterwards because it gives me that mental strength of knowing that I am capable of more than I believe.
depression,erw2wvw,t1_erw1c8g,1561331745.0,"I do go to a counsellor twice a week. I don't know what else I could do that is less stressful. I work part time in a cattery also which I love, but the pay is so low and it's only part time so I can't do that to pay the bills."
