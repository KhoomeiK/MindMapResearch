At first it sucks and it feels useless and like you're making no progress. I'm still subscribe to this sub(that's how I saw this post) but I no longer consider myself severely depressed. It's not even been a year since I started therapy, never the less it has brought me from hospitalization due to suicidal ideation to someone who gets good grades and is actually interested in life again. I completely understand the crying at work thing. Used to happen to me all the time. Couldn't go a single work day without hiding in the bathroom at least once. This is all very disorganized but I hope that you can see yourself making the same transformation. Seriously start seeing a mental health professional though. Asap. Get an online apointtment because of quarentine. Also pm me if u need someone to vent to. No judgement."

We would often go on ski trips and I made it clear since when I was little that I hated skiing. Making your kid try out skiing the first few times but they kept trying to make me like it until I was like 16 but I remember my mom getting mad at me for not wanting to skiing and not being cooperative enough. Once when I was older and it was established that I did not enjoy skiing she got furious at me for not appreciating enough her efforts to put together a trip. Idk. Maybe I should be more sympathetic. Something about it feels off to me though. I should also mention that I wasn't a complete shit about the trips either. I was just oppenly annoyed that they kept trying to force me to like what they like. Curios about your thoughts on the matter?

AskReddit,fh3k4ib,t3_f15nbj,1581269763.0,"When I was like in kindergarten or 1st or 2nd grade or some shit I had a baby sitter who would bring her daughter over and her daughter was a bit older than me. The daughter would get me to do sexual things with her, it was very odd like she treated it like playing house or something so I didn't realize how out of the norm it was. I know that it affected me because those are some of the only vivid memories I have from so young and that pisses me off but I can't say that it was traumatic to me or anything, probably because I was too young to know what was happening. To this day idk if the mom knew and just didn't care or if this was somehow under her radar. Luckily my mom is a very intuitive woman and realized something was up and removed those two from my life. I never have really talked about it with anyone because as I said it doesn't affect me that much to this day and whenever conversations about sexual assault are brought up I feel awkward bc I'm a guy. I suspect me being a slightly late bloomer sexuality might be related to that experience but I honestly couldn't say with confidence. Thanks OP for letting people who usually aren't able to share their stories of sexual assault. Terry Crews would probably be proud."

ainbow,fgd5q6i,t3_exq6gd,1580679181.0,"As horrible as this Twitter thread is, I think that it does not reflect the actual current culture of homophobia and how women participate in it today. Cis straight men get away with saying horrible biggoted things all of the time but if a maginalized LGBT woman said the same thing she would face a wider backlash. This isn't go say that we should accept bigotry in any form from the inside LGBT community but I think recognizing that sometimes we don't always react to bigotry in the same way depending on the race, sexuality, gender etc of a person is important.  

That being said, while I think we should act as human as possible by giving people with flawed world veiws the opportunity to grow, we have to stop bigotry from inside the LGBT community.  I've seen racism and transphobia to be the most glaring examples but bigotry in a hundred more forms are present. I think this happens because as marginalized people we often feel a lack of societal and social power and bigotry can give us a power rush and a feeling of being part of a special group. We can't let this happen to us. we have to support every facet of the LGBT community and call out bigotry when we see it but by most importantly not lashing back with bigotry of a different form.

On this thread I see it happening allot. I get the impulse but rushing into this thread to comment with your own lesbiphobia and biphobia is an incredibly immature and weak thing to do. And for those pissed off by this immature behavior please don't respond by saying homophobic things. As a community I think we can do better. Idk if anyone reads this or feels the same but I felt like I had to express this after finding this post."

Next time u catch yourself daydreaming when you really shouldn't be, find something productive to do instead. It's not easy but tracking your own md and seeing how much time you spend daydreaming is the best start imo.
