SuicideWatch,fpdv4ud,t1_fpdinaa,1588534855.0,I’d do martial arts and get ripped until you become a scary motherfucker who could beat anyone up. That’ll get you respect and hopefully confidence. That’s what I’d do in your shoes. I don’t think focusing on genes and tall boyfriends is healthy. You can control more than you think
SuicideWatch,fpduqk6,t1_fpdjst5,1588534628.0,"That’s how it was for me. Those fuckers literally just used me for entertainment and fucked with me and didn’t give two fucks about me. I think it’s really a myth that “high school is supposed to be the best time of your life” or something like that. Some people peak in high school. For a lot of people, it sucks ass and the rest of your life is better. You can make new and better friends, believe me."
Ebay,fpdi8jg,t1_fpdghf7,1588527501.0,"If they ship on time it’s not the sellers fault then, my seller shipped a day late and then got my negative feedback removed even though only half of it was related to it being late"
SuicideWatch,fpdhsws,t1_fpdgu39,1588527257.0,What have you tried so far? Therapy? Antidepressants? What helped me the most was physical exercise so I’ll make a shameless plug for that I guess.  How have you disappointed yourself? Feel free to PM if you want
SuicideWatch,fpdh6mt,t1_fpdh1h7,1588526912.0,Your situation sounds a lot like my high school experience honestly. And It really sucked. But I made it out and I believe that you can too man
SuicideWatch,fpdh1h7,t3_gctlsf,1588526832.0,"I was in same boat you were - poor family, bad genes, being short. That shits out of your control but you can control some things like exercise. Until I started working out I was really shy and not confident at all. Any other things hurting you? Happy to lend an ear if you need to vent"
SuicideWatch,fpdgaah,t3_gcu7pk,1588526411.0,I was a second away from killing myself in front of a train when I was in high school. At last second I backed out. And I’m so glad I didn’t do it because my life got so much better than then in so many unexpected ways. Even got to visit Japan (food is absolutely unreal over there btw). What are you going through OP? Need anyone to talk to or vent? I was in the same boat as you and can share some perspective
SuicideWatch,fpdeytx,t1_fpcmvoa,1588525675.0,"You know this might sound like really basic and stupid advice but lean into the areas of life that bring you joy like music and food and the parts of life that make life worth living. Everyone on this planet needs coping mechanisms to deal with pain, life freaking sucks a lot of the time. People at school might not bring you joy and in fact might be very cruel, but are there other people in life you can turn to like your sister? Anyone you can talk to? I’ve been down a similar road; I’m happy to listen to your problems or lend an ear if you ever need to vent"
Ebay,fpde0mz,t1_fp9y9a3,1588525140.0,Not an ass to expect the guaranteed delivery that you paid for; COVID19 sucks but people still make their decisions on what seller to choose based on shipping time.

SuicideWatch,fp7dxve,t3_gbp80j,1588368818.0,"I was in the same boat as you in high school, going from 4.0 to bad grades. You don’t want to hear this, but you don’t need to go to the Ivy Leagues. Even if you did everything right, it’s still a crapshoot. I know someone with a 36 and 4.0 and Harvard rejected them. And the vast majority of people I know who did go were fucking miserable there. I’m in the same boat you were in high school - I had great grades initially, and then had Bs and Cs, rejected by 8 schools including Ivy’s, and ended up going to a state school and landing my dream finance job making a ton of money. Same job, only difference is I spent a fraction of what going to an Ivy would have cost and am on much stronger financial footing. Most fields, you don’t need to go to any Ivy. I was in a field where going to any Ivy puts you at a strong advantage, but I got the same results anyways. I’m so glad I did not go actually. At the time, it feels like your life is crumbling and falling apart, but life goes on. Happy to lend an ear if you need someone to vent to."
SuicideWatch,fp562u1,t1_fp55fx0,1588317548.0,"Fuck dude I’m sorry for being cliche and I obviously don’t know your story or your struggles. Didn’t mean to come off like that. 

You do sound really smart though just from reading the text, and Im sure anyone who knows what neuronal innervation is a lot brighter than most. If you ever need to vent feel free to hit me up"
SuicideWatch,fp54k8d,t1_fp536sy,1588316084.0,"I’ve been there man - my girl cheated on me and it fucking ruined me for a bit. However. If she actually cheated on you, she is a whore. Nobody deserves anybody, there’s so many better girls out there who won’t cheat on you. If you feel like you don’t deserve girls, focus on improving yourself. Life is hard as fuck dude, and it’s painful and it sucks but diet/gym is one the few things you can control and if you put in the work and discipline now, it will pay dividends later. I was completely rudderless after my girl cheated on me but I focused on 100% weight loss and did push-ups whenever I was sad and hit the gym and cried my way through because of how fucking painful it was but you are stronger than you think and you can fucking get through it man. Keep your head up high king, fuck that unfaithful bitch."
SuicideWatch,fp53wqw,t3_gbcg7o,1588315484.0,"You’re a smart guy and will do amazing things. The fact that you have a garage, you have a car, you have brains and live in a first world country is a life that millions of people would kill to have. Don’t throw it all away by being stupid."

But things really do get better. Fast forward to now, I’m a happy college student with a super hot GF and people who love and care about me. I could never have imagined how much better things will get. I know it’s hard for you right now but things will get better. I’m here if you ever need to vent"
