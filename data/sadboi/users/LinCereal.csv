When you are feeling better, even briefly, it feels like you might be able to do this and you might be okay... Then when you're next in the depressed phase, it feels like that was such a lie and that this is where you belong forever.

I admire your determination to stay in this world. You deserve to be happier than you were today."
asktransgender,fpw3yty,t3_gfvs1l,1588956848.0,"I wouldn't call your behavior being a chaser, but you did touch on something that I think is important to consider: you are creating a separation between cis women and trans women. 

However, when you actually unpack what the separation you are creating entails, you're basically saying you feel cis women will have expectations of you that trans women won't. There may be some truth to this, as you seem to feel that cis people have weird baggage around gender norms that many trans people are forced to mature past. But there are no guarantees on either side. There are trans people who are still very stuck in the mindset that men should be men, and women should be women, and gender non-conforming behavior is bad... and there are cis people who are fully comfortable with others' experiences of their gender falling outside the norms. 

I might consider thinking of this as *not* a ""cis/trans"" dichotomy, but more thinking of it as ""I want to be with someone who will make me feel safe to express myself and my gender however I feel comfortable."" I hope that helps. :)"

stevenuniverse,fa88cae,t1_fa7shgl,1575842760.0,"It's also shown that she has this deep infatuation with humans' ability to change.

I feel like she must have thought she could never truly change because she's a gem, and gems just get stuck.

Obviously, this belief is false because we see the gems in the show change drastically throughout time - first because of Rose, and then because of Steven - but that's because *they had Rose* to help them do it. Pink didn't have anyone but herself to guide her through this process. She's so much stronger than I think she ever gave herself credit for. It's beautiful that she decided to create Steven - someone who could truly change and become a better person than she ever believed she could be - but I also mourn so much for her because the decision to do that cost her her existence.

I feel you so much."

Parenting,ey5nwey,t1_ey5mn1y,1566836219.0,"While you're right that it's not the end of the world, do keep in mind that when it rains and a child is without rainboots, the mother is blamed and the father is not. When the house is a mess, it's the wife's fault. When the meal doesn't turn out well, it's the wife's fault. This may or may not be actually playing out in your lives, but women in America (and elsewhere) are still raised to believe that. It's not that she's entirely *choosing* to take on the mental load, it's that she feels the pressure to do so, when you clearly do not.

That is not meant to be a criticism of you. It sounds like you do wonderfully well as a father and husband and do take care of things around the house and of chores. My intent is to let you know that it may not be as simple as ""she forces the load on herself."" Social conditioning takes an enormous amount of energy to unlearn."
aspergers,ey4j4zs,t1_ey30g4k,1566794143.0,"Think of it like this: when someone asks you ""Do you know where I can find sweaters?"" in a clothing store, the literal correct answers to that question are ""yes"" and ""no."" But if you DO know where to find a sweater, you probably know not to answer just with ""yes."" You'd probably say yes *and* give the location of the sweaters, because the speaker is actually asking ""Where are the sweaters?"" despite that not being the literal question they asked. It's about seeing them as interchangeable. The question-asker isn't playing games with you - they just believe the two to be equivalent phrases. 

I struggled a lot with NT speech that I found frustrating (""why can't they just say what they mean?"") before I realized that there are actually a ton of non-literal phrases that I recognize and use all the time. That took a lot of the value judgment out of it for me and then it became easier to learn."

But when I read about peoples' lives, experiences, stories, emotions, challenges, motivations... when I read a new perspective or learn something about someone else's life, it gives me a kind of joy and fulfillment that I can't possibly put to words. It's way, way beyond the way NTs ""like people."" I don't just *like* people. I live and breathe them and they fascinate me to no end. I want to know everything there is to know about everyone. I want to know what life is like if you have cystic fibrosis, or if you live in Turkmenistan, or if you have quintuplets, or even if you're Joe down the street because every perspective and every story is so unique and beautiful.
