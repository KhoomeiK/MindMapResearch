Is it possible to estimate when this will all end and how will we even know it‚Äôs over? Is it possible that if cases of infected people keep rising, several countries will stay on lockdown for a long time (let‚Äôs say over a year)? 
In addition, let‚Äôs say the number of new cases in a country keeps declining and the government decides to go back to ‚Äòbusiness as usual‚Äô. Then, because people start travelling around and meeting each other again, the number of new infections goes back up, forcing the country to go into lockdown again.

Many thanks."

loseit,fcn5wrq,t3_ehrikx,1577804109.0,"I lost some weight in the past through keto but gained almost everything back which I feel like was due to the carb deprivation. I don‚Äôt think that keto is a good long-term solution since I think that your body needs carbs to function properly. You can still lose weight if you‚Äôre picking the healthy kinds of carbs while maintaining some calorie deficit. That way you should also have some energy to do something simple like walking a little, let‚Äôs say. Best of luck in your endeavours, I absolutely applaud you for starting on this journey again! You can totally do this.
