LightNovels,fe0vsdf,t3_enegy9,1578819215.0,I'm currently reading Owarimonogatari and man it's so good! I think you will have a great time reading it :)

LightNovels,f91wkfa,t3_e2ujlv,1575003621.0,"Loved the book, but the movie for me was so-and-so. It generally cut out the day-to-day feel the book has, which I found to one of the more interesting things; how they meet, making plans, meeting up etc. You can almost visually read how their relationship develops."
LightNovels,f8oxa0z,t1_f8oojut,1574691926.0,Yep :) Volume 8
LightNovels,f8o09qg,t3_e19pd8,1574658081.0,"I... Love this series.

I... Love it."

ForeverAlone,f7mcwow,t3_dwxbk1,1573859933.0,"Currently working at a local factory through a ""hiring company"", meaning I have no actual employment. I have both a bachelor's degree in Political science and a master's degree in Health Economics, Policy and Management, but still can't get a job 5 months after graduation. Basically living week-to-week. Also I'm currently living with my grandmother because I can't afford anything else. FML."
LightNovels,f71s5d9,t3_du36vu,1573346922.0,"If you're wiling to pick something off the list, I would recommend The Empty Box and Zeroth Maria. The last volume (7) came out a few days ago and it's regarded as one of the best light novel series out there. IMO it's totaly worth the money to get in-print."
LightNovels,f6mfxqm,t3_druc6p,1572972341.0,"Have to disagree with you here. I found vol. 1 kinda boring to be honest. The overall plot was fine, but the character interactions were cringey as fuck. The writing was just terrible overall. The ending was quite good though. I'm probably gonna pick up vol. 2 to see if it improves."

LightNovels,f2gk25a,t3_ddewxh,1570231628.0,Still waiting for my copy of Suspension. Can't wait!
lonely,f1etu3q,t3_d8xvlv,1569430113.0,Same here. It sucks.
LightNovels,f0z6so5,t3_d7czas,1569087802.0,"I'm very hopeful for vol 3. I had little knowledge about the series until I randomly picked up the first book because Nisioisin is the author. Really liked it and bought the second book, which was even better. Hopefully we'll get all nine (?) books someday."
metro,eyviz6e,t3_cyt095,1567496687.0,Only need to complete the game on RHC to get the platinum. If I play it on NG+ will it still count?

LightNovels,ex4sbgl,t3_crebfg,1566010087.0,Dang. Congrats getting a copy of NHK. Thats an (expensive) rarity.
LightNovels,evv2w6v,t1_evv088v,1564816722.0,"Volume 1 is a self contained story but leaves the ending open for sequals, which obviously happened. Volume 2 is the same. Volume 3 and 4 however are a two-part story, meaning volume 3 ends on a cliffhanger. The same is for volume 5 and 6, a two-parter. Volume 7 isnt out yet, but its the last volume so I assume it is self contained. Hope this helps and I would strongly recommend to give the series a chance!"
LightNovels,evtag6y,t3_cl5sg4,1564766234.0,"Nice! Hope you enjoy them, Nisioisin is an awesome writer."

ForeverAlone,evd9m1z,t3_cjenld,1564433168.0,"Sorry if I'm being a part pooper (no ban pls, I am FA myself), but a lot, and I mean A LOT, of girls and women have to deal with different sorts of harassment everyday. Stating that ""I have a boyfriend"" is an effective means to get boys/guys off your back. That's why it's so prevalent and, in my opinion, it's an understandable excuse to make, even if it may hurt the guy asking."
LightNovels,eugseg9,t1_eudxmbg,1563814002.0,"Thanks. I have way more ""normal"" books + manga than LNs, but you have to start somewhere :)"
LightNovels,eugsad9,t1_eue08uu,1563813942.0,One of the next ones I'm planning to pick up :)

LightNovels,eud8kmy,t1_eud8hc4,1563707379.0,"Definitely. Volume 1 is super good and volume 3 is my favorite. It's a bit lackluster in 5 and 6, but 7 is the last volume, so hopefully it has a good ending."
