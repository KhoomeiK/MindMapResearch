They're still people. They're still a weird, marginalized group. They come in all types.

The way some people act on here, you'd think a gang of transgendered people murdered their dog and forced them to eat it, fuck.

How much of a bitch do you need to be to lose your shit over the I D E A of a bearded person wearing a dress?"
TumblrInAction,fq6h4nd,t3_ggwgjf,1589131418.0,"Holy fuck, when did TumblrInAction become so uncompromisingly anti-transgender?

Over the years, this subreddit has been looking more and more like the very thing it was trying to criticize in the first place: a pissy, dramatic, biased echo-chamber.

Good on you OP, for still possessing some fucking empathy and reason."
Anxiety,fc6ucg9,t3_egdenq,1577489713.0,"Surprisingly comforting to hear this asked. I've been feeling so crazy and so 'off' and I can't stop thinking about how it's a sign that I'm about to die which makes me panic and the whole thing spirals out of control.

Our bodies can be a real pain in the ass. Hang in there, everyone."

AskReddit,f48wil6,t1_f47mkip,1571450885.0,I agree with you that comparing Cowboy Bebop to Firefly is unfair BUT I also totally believe that Firefly is a rip-off of Outlaw Star and Outlaw Star is a stupid masterpiece.

But applying that to all STIs is just childish ignorance.

Surely, Blizzard is committed to being a neutral, apolitical force. I'm sure it's extremely unlikely that China's dick is shoved deeeep down their money-worshipping throats.

I would get them in my toes occasionally, but one time it broke off inside like you said and I needed surgery to get it out.

I didn't even realize it was in there either, couldn't even see the deep fucker.
But it got pretty infected, pretty quick, so, y'know, cue the ER trip."
