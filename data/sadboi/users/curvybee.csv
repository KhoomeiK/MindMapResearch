I've never had my house burn down but I have to pay the fire department to save other people's houses... Your argument is stupid. Being part of a society should include helping other people. It's not about you or me, it's about all of us. Yes, trade schools are important too, but making higher education more affordable helps everyone. And the fact that we as a society don't front most of these costs is ridiculous. This is the same argument against Medicare for all, because why should any of us care about some sick kid we've never met, amiright? Fucking sickening the way people like you think"

This was also a brand new place for me so I was super nervous but my hair turned out great and it was a lot easier than I thought.

 If you're going to a new place do some research on the stylists available so you know what they're able to do. Also, the place I went let me book through Google, so no phone call either!!"

AskReddit,fcusa3o,t3_eixc75,1577987492.0,"In 2010 I met an older man on World of Warcraft. I was 23, he was 34. We started an online courtship. I flew out to meet him and he came out to meet my family. Things were going really well.

In 2011 I moved halfway across the US to live with him. I started college, went full time and worked full time while living with him. After a while, he became emotionally and mentally abusive. He didn't trust me around other men, I couldn't go anywhere alone except for school and work. I didn't have any friends I could live with, and I couldn't afford anything by myself. I was on the brink of suicide.   


In 2013 I met someone on Reddit who lived in the same town as me. We ended up meeting up and really clicking. 4 months later I was able to leave and I moved in with my new friend and their friends. We also dated briefly. 

Since then I've met other people using OK Cupid and Tinder and everyone's been pretty great, even if we didn't stay together. I've been with my current partners for almost 4 years now and I'm in a much better place mentally."
