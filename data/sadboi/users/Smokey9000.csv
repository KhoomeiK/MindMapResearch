Theyd periodically change the way they wanted us to stock backstock and talk down on us for not having it done that way, few months go by and they change it back talk down on us for changing it to begin with. When i was hired they hired me at 9$/hr said that in 30 days theyd give me a raise to 10$/hr, 10 months went by before i recieved this raise. What finally made me quit in the end was there was 9 of us, all but 3 including myself got sick so it was me and 2 others, we were hauling ass, i bumped the loading bay door with thw forklift in my rush to unload the truck, hopped off and checked, it had a tiny dent but was still fully functional so i got back to work. There was 34 8+ft tall pallets, we got 32 pallets done, swept cleaned up and fronted the store and went home for the weekend, i left a note about the door, we work tuesday night and get done sunday morning, so sunday, monday and tuesday day they had to work 2 fucking pallets, 3 days to rork 2 FUCKING pallets. Tuesday night we see 1 and 3/4s of a pallet lwt, 3 days they worked 1/4 of a pallet and WE get bitched at because of it, told never to clockout for the weekend and i got wrote up for all the forklift damage that has been there since before i started working there, i was then pulled off the forklift pending retraining well surprise, theres one other guy on our team that knows how to run it, and when made aware that forklift training did not come with a raise just more responsibility, no one wanted to learn how to do it. I was there for a month or two more when i gave them my notice (took the time to get a new job before i quit."
