BPD,fcmy6m2,t3_ei1sq9,1577797335.0,"Sounds tough. I've always been pretty positive but have hit a bad patch recently as I feel I've exhausted any option to be ""normal"" Have you tried going ""big picture"". Thats where I'm at. I'm fascinated with the dream-like nature of reality. There are great vids of utube about reality and what quantum physics says about how the universe is all mental/consciousness rather than a material world. I feel like if I can see life as a dream, then I'll be all like ""what evs man"" about my shitty life. ONly drowning men shall see god and all that.

Try and find a way to hang in there. I know its hard but this life is a crazy ride. Sometimes up, sometimes down ( a lot of times down for some) - who knows whats around the corner. I feel like 2020 could be a crunch year for humanity. We either fly or crash and burn."
CPTSD,fclse9p,t3_ehmp70,1577755313.0,"I can relate to this a lot. I drifted away from a bunch of people I was so close to - they were basically family - in my earlish twenties. I started working full time in an office and I started becoming dead and weird. I needed to keep doing my art and just work part time as my art keep me grounded and vital and energised. But thats all hindsight now that I finally learnt from but its cost me in becoming alone and now I'm trying to fight my way back in.

This will sound a bit woo-woo but in quantum mechanics when particles become entangled, then no matter how far apart they seperate - even vast distances - they are still connected with one always affecting the other. I feel like that happens when you really connect  with people. They become a part of you and you will always be attached at some elemental level.

I still often have emotional flashbacks to those times and I still feel a strong connection to them. The problem is its been like 20 years now - the time just disappears.  It would be so awkward to try and find them - don't even know if I could. Yet I feel like something will always be missing without them. They are in the tapestry of my life and its threadbare with that huge mess there. I kind of cut myself off even when thinking about them because its so painful and weird. How did I let it happen?

Maybe I'm summon up the courage to contact them. At least I will know one way or another if any of that friendship is still there."
depression,fbypshf,t3_ef3eig,1577223133.0,I can see how that would be really difficult around Christmas. Do you have good memories from her around this period - times you were together or  went on holidays or gave each other presents etc? Maybe try and focus on those.
depression,fbypl1a,t3_ef4960,1577222979.0,I'm feeling that way a bit. Part of me just wants to stay inside and play Red Dead Redemption. But I know its because I've drifted away from so many people cos of these shitty internal feelings. I'm making effort to get back in the game. You can't give up on your connections - you get too isolated and it can become a form of hell of loneliness and boredom. It is hard sometimes to put that mask on and be social but I think the more you get the ball rolling the easier it becomes. Maybe.
CPTSD,f99c9lz,t3_e43pn1,1575189657.0,"> my friends, my family has no idea that I spent half of my life with high functioning chronic depression

I hate this - its the worse thing. I'm a split personality. Able to function pretty well with my mask with people but deep down feeling something is so terribly wrong with me. In some ways I know I am a luckier than the chronic depressed people who can't work or socialise at all. But other times I think its been a horrible trap to have the ability to fake it and never able to truly show my crippled insides and then maybe, just maybe, find a way to do something about it."
spirituality,ewl9pav,t3_cor5vs,1565512833.0,"I've felt this too the last couple of days. I felt absolutely terrible last night. Thought about drinking but even that seemed pointless - yet another cheap high that leads me crashing to earth brutally the next day. I tried to go to bed to read but couldn't focus. Its felt like I've reached the end of my normal coping/distraction methods and I can't avoid staring at the gaping void in my soul, one I've run from my whole life.

I have dreams about my first girlfriend from decades ago that haunt me - how I screwed it up. They are so painful and devastating. 

Let me know if you find the universe is telling you something. I seem to be getting a lot of messages about flow and water recently. I came across a Tao website that resonated with me. And had the Shape of Water DVD sitting there and watched it last night (good little film)

I know people say this all the time about a ""big change a comin"" but but I feel like 2020 is going to be a crucial year. Everything seems to be coming to a head. Maybe a death and rebirth is coming. Try to go with the flow as best as you can. Hang in there!"
BPD,eqiljwa,t3_byhwwt,1560089229.0,"I wish I could slowly fade away. At first you wouldn't see much difference. But each day I would get a little more faded, a little less real. Like a shirt that's been washed a lot, all the dye would go out of me. Finally towards the end, there would only be the faintest trace of who I was. Then nothing. Invisible. Completly see through. Just a thought of who I was. I was less than a dream. I was ghost all along. A ghost that never even existed."
BPD,eppvgft,t3_bvemwe,1559392829.0,Thats horrible. People throw terms around so fucking loosely. Don't take it personally.
BPD,epputzg,t3_bmu77n,1559392355.0,It should be the Snoo - but with a zig zag line dividing snoo and the two halves seperated. One side smiling - one side sad. And in the middle is a dotted line - the border line.
BPD,eppu68t,t3_bvhfot,1559391842.0,I guess you don't necessarily know what is going on with her. Sometimes this stuff you can't force. Maybe he is blocking you but its up to her to allow that or not. Focus on yourself and give yourself the attention you deserve.
BPD,epptvq3,t3_bvf3n4,1559391610.0,"I just cut a tarot card for you - I've just started that and had some amazing coincidences. ""4 of Pentacles - money improvements. More coming your way"" 

It's a picutre of a person with a crown - (I think a king) holding one of those pentagram stars. I think it is indicating that your animus (the male side of you inside) needs to rise up so you are not so dependent on males. Maybe. I don't know if I'm honest - I'm an amateur at this. Anyway good luck - believe in yourself and all the best. You can do this. Hang in there and you will find a strength in yourself."
BPD,eppsoor,t3_bvjqgr,1559390646.0,"I think its because you cut off those ""real"" parts of yourself as they were broken and diseased from childhood. Like a surgeon with a deathly ill patient on the table, you do what you have to do with the cold precision of keeping this person alive at all cost and cut out those parts of yourself out that are infected. You are now an amputee, alive but missing limbs others have. We learn to function with one arm and one leg. But others don't see that and wonder why doing what they do is so hard for us. But we are alive. We are alive."
spirituality,eplla9t,t3_buzpqq,1559298306.0,"I just pulled a tarot card at random for another post here - I've never used it before but they just mentioned it - and I pulled the card DEATH! I'm wondering if 2020 isn't going to be a turning point and we are going through a form of death of our current outlook (materialistic) to something that is more balanced. It feels like so many people are hitting the wall with how things are currently.

And that crows thing. Just before I was watching a vid on funny about a raven ""talking"" to a cat. Now I turned my head and I have a book from the library about Shamanism with a crow on the cover! Synchronicity baby!"
spirituality,eplkhjd,t3_bv44xl,1559297800.0,"I had deck of tarot cards sitting on my bookshelf that I've never used. As a bit of fun because you mentioned tarot I shuffled, cut the deck  and turned the top card (don't know if thats how you do it - prob not but whatever). And I pulled the card DEATH number 13. Yowser. It says ""Death of situation or endings. New Beginnings"".

So maybe you are in a purgatory stage where your old ways/life/outlook has died and you are waiting for a new way to be born. But you have to be patient. It will arise organically when its ready - like when a baby is ready to pop out - you can't really force it.

That's kind of how I feel at the moment. I've been reading a book that has really resonated with me about the cosmos having one dimension - The One Source of all Things - and two realities - subtle reality (the realm of ideas) and material reality (which implements ideas in the physical reality). Both need each other otherwise ideas can't become something real. I had fascinating dreams last night with one thing in particular sticking with me. I was playing the song ""House of the Rising Sun"" (which I can on my guitar in real life) but it became ""House of the Rising Spirituality"". 

My gut is telling me some powerful energies are rising up at the moment. I wonder as we head to 2020 that is going to be a powerful turning point. It's just got a special ring to it does 2020. Something about duplication - above reflected in below.  I feel like a lot of the world is in an in-between state. That is the DEATH maybe for the new thing to be born.

I think we have to stay patient but open to ideas (the subtle realm). A bit like fishing - wait with a patient readiness when something tugs at the line. There will be a tension with that - you want it to happen asap. But you can't catch a fish pulling the line in all the time. Just let it be out there, bobbing away. Maybe write down your dreams in a journal and let them bob away at the back of your mind during the day and see if they stimulate other things.

Oh and card 13 (death) which adds to 4 which is 2020 added together! Mmmm...there could be something in that...maybe....."
