Accutane,fr04tzf,t1_fqwl5t6,1589783781.0,You're spot on.
Accutane,fr03gkn,t1_fqzskg0,1589782612.0,"1 IU of Vitamin A is going to be 0.3-0.6mcg. That means 200 IU = 60-120mcg.

>The recommended **daily** allowance (RDA) for **vitamin** A is 900 mcg and 700 mcg per day for men 

That would mean 200 IU of Vitamin A is only going to be around 7-14% of your RDA of Vitamin A.

Maybe I'm saying nonsense but this seems to be right from what I can find."
Accutane,fr026s6,t3_glubae,1589781567.0,Body lotion can be irritating to our more sensitive face skin so it's up to you if you want to see how your face reacts to the body cream. If you're asking because you don't want to spend a lot on a face cream I know a great option so lmk.
Accutane,fqze3ux,t1_fqygtnl,1589765449.0,Any flavored whey protein powder has no Vitamin A. So are you trying to avoid whey because of the possibility of breaking out? If you have to get a protein powder with Vitamin A perhaps you can make up for it by cutting out anything currently in your diet that has Vitamin A but you haven't thought about (some produce for example).
Accutane,fqzdebi,t3_glno3m,1589765024.0,Been on a high dose for over half a year and I don't seem to have any terrible side effects. They're all pretty mild and when they were bad it was only for a few days out of all the months. No nosebleeds! It did take a while for my face to look like it was starting to clear (in comparison the typical 1-2 months you see here)
