‚ÄúWhile it is important to accept others kinks and fetishes, it‚Äôs equally important to consider the implication of role playing in a way that normalizes and sexualizes the global issue of child sexual abuse. 

Even if everyone wants to be baby sometimes.‚Äù

In my single days I was seeing a man very into that dd/lg and we never became anything further bc of how uncomfortable and disgusted it made me feel. No amount of education on the subject will make me feel comfortable with childhood being sexualised or grown adults pretending to be children. Have fun sucking ur pacifier and shitting in a nappy with other consenting adults, I still find it beyond unsettling and harmful."
yiffinhell,fno6yjv,t3_g2w2n3,1587114406.0,"This kind of thing makes me sick. I work with young children and I just cannot understand how someone can comfortably sexualise that. I‚Äôve experienced children that are so damaged from sexual abuse, they just cannot live a normal, healthy childhood. It just really rubs me up the wrong way when it‚Äôs casually fetishised and just referred to like some normal kink. Like as if CSA doesn‚Äôt destroy lives and families. I think that‚Äôs my biggest issue with the furry community. Normalising really harmful things. I‚Äôve seen way too much of this especially through this sub recently. Man so fucking gross"
