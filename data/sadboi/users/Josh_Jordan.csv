mentalhealth,fqp97ps,t3_gk2f9s,1589539507.0,"I completely relate and I’m about oh 10-15 years ahead of you in terms of that journey.  I just went thru the densest fog from Oct/Nov. until Mother’s Day when it lifted, not magically but through the efforts and things I’ve learned in those 10 years of experience I’ve got on you.  

I’d probably still be in that fog, one of the worst I’ve had in over a decade, if I didn’t actively work to get out of it.  Some of that “active” work is learning how to let go and not do/think anything.  

You are already so far along because you’ve self identified a ton of stuff and you are naturally slowing down to go one step at a time ... I still have to remind myself one step at a time very actively.  

First congratulate yourself for being able to articulate all you have in this post!  Show your wife this post and tell her you’re doing well and you will keep fighting everyday!

Here is where to start that’s helped me and it’s on YouTube so it’s free:
[Zaroj MH daily morning mix](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL46Svm1QFC_xduJ1hIAIcFNdVNto8HTNq) 

If you don’t get into that playlist let me know and I’ll send you the individual links there are only 9)
I’ll leave you with this ... I have never, personally, “liked” Steve Jobs or Steve Harvey: 
But I have the utmost respect for both men based on the stories of vulnerability they have presented for us in the videos!  

Make your own playlist after you’re ready too ... everyone’s afraid man.  True strength is being able to stand strong in the face of that fear and manage it!   But look at you, only one therapist visit and you are already automatically self correcting that’s freaking  massive!!!!!
👏🏽⭐️

Edit: it’s 4:50 am.  I’m starting the playlist for my day and beginning my routine.  If you have questions, need someone to listen or anything,feel free to reach out"
datingoverthirty,fqp804n,t1_fqo0ar5,1589538300.0,"Everyone has fear ... move past that, it’s your task not his ... clearly he is fine, and he will be for a moment (I struggled thru that for 2 years), but don’t tarry 

Ex: we spoke the other day and she slipped in “oh right I’m 5 years older than you” and I corrected her ... she is 5 years 11 mos and 348 days older than me so almost 6 years.  She said something akin to “I thought it didn’t matter to you.”

It still doesn’t!   I’ve known the exact age gap for the entire time.  I also remembered her birthday, Pearl Jam and Eddie Vetter are her thing from the 90s (real original lol) ... I still know when she is troubled by life and try to aid as a friend!

He’s fine.  You need to work through this.  Everyone is scared lol.  I was scared I was too young for her ... Ultimately I just didn’t care because it was her ... not anything that “makes up ‘her’” ... that I loved. Best of luck.  It’s your task ... so don’t let anyone else tell you what to 
do. you know how you feel and it’s OK no matter what that is!

Edit:   I said the wrong thing more than a few times.  It took two years of going thru it before I agreed to the last time she said ... “maybe the age is too much...”.  I don’t agree to this day, but I agreed with her that time because I couldn’t keep going through it ... it’s her task."
datingoverthirty,fqnwlgg,t3_gjwja9,1589502840.0,42M. You need to work through this quickly.  I was in the exact same situation just 40 and 46.  We were from the same generation.  I mean I have a brother a year older than her ... it’s not an issue at all.  It became an issue because she just couldn’t let it go...
mentalhealth,fqlbugb,t1_fql33sj,1589453301.0,"The most important thing for me sometimes is to repeat “ok, not alone.”  Nothing beyond that during struggles ... nothing else matters at that moment just breathe and focus.  

The most helpful to me has been a varied approach: YouTube for motivational videos and spiritual videos, books and of course support from my doctor.  It’s not easy but you can do it.  

On Monday, the fog of my mind lifted and this week has been a new beginning again.  But I now have to work to build myself back up."

datingoverthirty,fqceio1,t3_ghx5a1,1589256253.0,"42M Pretty accurate comments below.  Feel honest to me based on my 1 year experience.  My top 3 were Tinder, Bumble, and CMB - I was having really good initial luck on Hinge, and liked the platform, but that was December and I’d burned out with my efforts by then.  

I like Bumble the best for my demographics and interests.  Tinder is the most convenient to play the OLD version of candy crush.  CMB was doing well for me but the 3 meets that progressed to dates were with women in different places from me.  I looked at it like they were a year or a few ahead of me in being ready to move on to the next stage of life.  

I’m back to some self improvement and introspection etc.  

I just matched for the 5th time with the same lady in my city.  First on Bumble, seemed to hit it off and I was too comfortable communicating then she got scarred off.  2nd match on Tinder and I tried the different approach, less sentences in my texts. Lol.  But it fizzled out on both parts.  3rd match on Tinder again. I was upfront about prior 2 matches and she freaked out and unmatched.  4th match on Hinge she noticed quicker and unmatched.  She liked my profile for the 5th time this week, 3rd time on Tinder, and I haven’t decided if I match again just because I think this may be the closest I get an OLD relationship 🤷🏽‍♂️. This is a professional woman as well ... who knows I’m not about to judge her 🙂"
datingoverthirty,fqccn98,t1_fqbs10x,1589255008.0,"A few months before the pandemic I was really considering speed dating.  In a large city like mine, it’s very well organized and convenient for busy professionals ... I liked the idea of personal interaction with like minded people w/o having to deal with the whole bar scene ... day late and a dollar short."
datingoverthirty,fqccd5g,t1_fqbmrx2,1589254819.0,"42M I’ve only been on OLD 1 year and I think you’re spot on ... the edit comment especially.  I’ll be the first to raise my hand in the divorced community.  

Also agree as to monetizing ... it’s all about stock price"
datingoverthirty,fqcc17k,t1_fqbe85l,1589254598.0,"42M. I can relate.  I fall in to the above noted “future fakers” set now because I had good initial success in matches and first meet then first date, distinction for me, and all 5 were off to the races with meeting kids and really opening up, which I get I’m easy to talk to, but it was a whole lot real fast ... I mean I was trying to get to know them and them to know me first before I started to worry about what the world thought"
datingoverthirty,fpwje6x,t1_fpvhwuz,1588964492.0,"42M.  Last year my relationship with a 48F ended because she thought the age range was too far apart.  I didn’t really have a response.  I had constantly reassured her that I didn’t see any age difference at all.  It got to be annoying that at my age and stage I’m life I was having to reassure her that I had not been robbed from a cradle and had made my own decision to date her.  

After I passed 35 it all felt the same to me except the wide age gaps of 15 years plus ...smh"
datingoverthirty,fpwiv4e,t1_fpw11am,1588964228.0,What a great observation.  Thank you.
datingoverthirty,fpwijnq,t3_gft57z,1588964067.0,"42M - great question!  I’d like to find a partner in my age range to really click even on a generational level.  I’ve tried here are some observations of mine that are reflected in my adaptation to OLD:
40s women tend to really know what they want and aren’t prepared to waste a second if there is a hint that my interests might vary
40s women are very savvy thus if you slip up just once in communication because of a bad day or whatever it’s “strike 1” 
40s divorcées with kids aren’t about to have me tell them what to do in this day and age, but I need to figure out how to do that with chivalry and old fashioned confidence while being the pursuer
40s women have too fond a memory of Mr Big from SiTC and any other Hollywood character that’s not the most realistic.  
40s divorcées empty nesters aren’t about to wait a moment longer because my youngest is only in 8th grade. 

To be clear these are my observations only

It’s a tall order.  It’s worth it and I’m going to keep at it but it takes work.  

Sometimes I will change my age range to take a break ... I’ve definitely found my bottom limit - 30 though I use 29 to catch the OLD age errors (I’m not 50 but can’t change).  I keep hoping that maybe I’ll match with a women in the +\- 5 years range but dip down into the 30s range it’s a different set of expectations and filters to account for ..."
mentalhealth,fpuihec,t3_gewdnm,1588913764.0,"Yes. My specific twist to it is: I see all my contacts and I don’t want to bother them with my trouble or cause them any inconveniences.  I am very empathic so I “feel” (jump to conclusions) about them judging me or avoiding me etc... it starts a self fulfilling cycle that is really hard to break.  

Another farcical saying “the only thing to fear is fear itself.”   If they only knew how scary fear really can be.  

You’re not alone.  It’s taken me a long time (20 years) to be able to recognize, rationalize and communicate that.

I was doing really well (ups and downs) for about 1.5 year and situational circumstances have caused me issues again.  So I’m struggling and I’m back to a support of people who don’t know exactly the demons I deal with but they can relate.  You’re not alone and the darkness is not so dark when you’re not alone."

One step at a time ... yesterday I had an episode where I was up early and on top of my game, really aggressive but couldn’t focus or concentrate on one task then the ride came to an end at 4pm and I crashed for 3 hours woke up anxious and depressed to the max.   This morning I woke up and thanked myself for being able recognize it at 7:30 last night (30 minute struggle) and take the 3 hours to resolve the situation.

OLD for 4 mos. just started a break for the holidays because of the intensity and emotional exhaustion of OLD.  I have a match with a very similar situation ... she was match no. 4 in an unlikely set of 4 matches at once.  We both tried to make a meet up work but jobs and my responsibilities got in the way.  Talked on the phone multiple times for hours ... 

I went on dates with the other 3 matches (first come first served and all) it was expensive, intense and exhausting.  After which I had to take a break.  I communicated that but then the conversation has just dried up ... too bad as well because we really clicked in what seemed to be a really relaxed fashion.  

Now I’m unsure if I can even reach out it’s been so long ... but I’m the end I’m not too worried about it because I had to do what’s right for me.  I’ll be back on OLD but sometimes you just have to step back because it’s crazy.   If the match is Ms. Right then I’m thinking a break and reaching out later should be okay.

It takes some honest and hard work on yourself and your relationship with your ex.  You already have a co-parenting relationship now you just need to navigate it after marriage, amicably.   Because it’s about your happiness so it’s easy not to get sucked in to BS drama.  

In the end, your kids will be understanding of you are also honest with them and just be their mom.
