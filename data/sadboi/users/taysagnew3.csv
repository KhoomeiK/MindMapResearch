postpartumdepression,fdeu748,t3_eglfel,1578346689.0,"BUT you will probably get to skip the major anxiety since you are already considering the diet and exercise. Your lifestyle will change, but you absolutely can do it. And if you start before you end the meds, you can wean the meds. I quit cold turkey and I just ended up getting dizzy a lot for a few weeks. Honestly if you need to reach out on a different platform my user is the same as my insta except without the 3. I don’t really do anything through conventional doctors anymore... my MIL is a retired pediatrician so I just trust her to help with identifying if my son needs medical care. I am breastfeeding, thriving on a vegan lifestyle. I am exhausted, I am a mother, sometimes life feels meaningless, but it is much easier to get out of bed and just at least give life a try, one more time. Also, this may seem silly, but going out into nature it healing too, being around the calmness of nature vs the chaos of city life is very healing and helps you create your inner calm. You become what you are around the most."
postpartumdepression,fdetb4v,t3_eglfel,1578346161.0,"Yoga with Adriene, Infinite Waters and DrSebi are the kickstarter influencers of my healing journey two years ago. Also I want to mention I was on Zoloft... for me, I just felt very neutral all the time, no happy no sad, no emotion, no expression, but my life didn’t change at all. My life looked the same, I still had stomach aches because of the food I was eating (toxic junk). My room was a mess, I was in a dead end relationship. All the junk was still there a piling, I got off it, felt with some major issues of anxiety, started smoking weed, helped me be calm enough to find my way towards healing and what might help, been off weed for way over a year now. I still have ups and downs but instead of it being the difference between deep sea diving and climbing Mt Everest, it’s more like a stroll through the hills on the sound of music. It’s easier to handle the lows and see the light at the end and the highs are not addictive or distracting either. It’s calm here. I meditate too, it helps me not have any stimulation and truly connect to only my own inner experiences, same with yoga. I am truly grateful for them."
postpartumdepression,fdesfhc,t3_eglfel,1578345639.0,"Yes. I did it even before my baby was born sept 2019. I went vegan and I do yoga, no sugar or bread. Everyone is different though, it took my a while to find what is working. I also have a spiritual niche so that helps the hopelessness be eased. Self love have been huge. Both a practice and ideology. Do things that are acts of love for yourself, talk to yourself like you are someone you love or someone who truly deserves love, because you do. Really all of these diseases are labels for normal human experiences turned extreme because humanity has some extreme trauma we are currently healing, slowly, but surely. I pray you peace on your life’s journey."

As for his blank face, if you are in a city, your baby was probably handled by a lot of staff just “doing their job” and they probably had blank faces and didn’t interact with him much. He is just unaware of all the difference expressions he can express, so yay you, you get to share those with him and he gets to fall in love with you❤️ truth is mama, none of us know what we are doing, but I am grateful we are all working together. Love your body, not for what it looks like, but at least for the bad ass things it can do like create a whole new human, hold you together, literally, have an orgasm, transfer nutrients to your cells. There is so much your body does to keep you alive right now, take a deep breath and honor that, your body is literally magical and it loves you. Start talking to yourself more kindly, you truly deserve your own love and attention. Start learning about nutrition if you feel called, that is a great way to show yourself some love.

Self love
I understand yo. I personally don’t experience God as a man or being outside of me, I experience God as a concept. There is a reason God is mentioned so much over forever, because the universe outside of us seems to be the controlling force. And yes, we are at the mercy of our external influences, but we must also see that we are influential as well. To 7 billion other people YOU are an external influence. 

Idk. God’s such a massive and complex concept though. I truly feel like “God is love” and as long as we activate and embody love, that is allowing Hod to work through us rather than seeking “him” to work in front of us. 

You can change your life.

“Let all that you do be done in love”

If I would have kept eating sugar I’d be sick all the time. Salmon and grilled chicken are debatably healthy. Steak however is famous for heart disease, and when our hearts are unhealthy, no wonder we are sad. Lettuce is the least nutritious vegetable on the line, it contains mostly water. Eating healthy is not a diet, it is eating foods that support life, not disease. We need vitamins, minerals, water, fats, protein and natural sugars to help our bodies thrive. It is quite easy to live a healthy lifestyle."

depression,f4l8lab,t3_dkx9yc,1571663824.0,"Energy options-

Exercise: 
- yoga for calming and breathing, get the inner energy moving
- running or active for amping up getting your endorphins pumping
- dance for both

Food:
- cut meat: eat death, feel like death
- cut dairy: heavy
- cut fried: foods: cancer
- cut sugar: takes energy away from you to even digest it, dates and date paste are a great replacement
- add fruits: gives healthy sugars slowly to sustain energy over time 
- add chia seeds: “chia” known in ancient Egypt as “strength” they thought chia seeds gave supernatural powers. Better energy levels from my experience.
- add dark leafy greens: my fave combo is mango and kale, kale is FULL of magnesium, this is going to calm your cells and actually heal your body as it is digested. 
- add veggies: bleh, it’s hard but they will make you feel better with all the added nutritional support
- add B supplement: this is going to help clear brain fog
- add healthy fats like avocado and olive oil: these are going to help you sustain stable energy levels
- add quinoa: protein source of complete nutrition 
- add water: get about a gallon a day of pure water, remineralized RO water or spring water.

Activities:
- Go outside even if it is cold and be with the elements, notice how the sun is warm, the wind flows through the trees, the birds sing, if you can put your bare feet into grass or soil, stretch out your limbs as if waking up from a deep rest.
- Do something creative, write a poem, draw a mandala, dance. Just do something to express what you are feeling on the inside.
- Chant/mantra: find a few words that help you get through harder moments: “I am love” “I am worthy” “I am capable” say whatever you need in that moment.
- Meditation: just sit with your feelings and body and mind and allow yourself a break from stimulation, yoga helps the sitting position not be so hard and heavy, a little yoga goes a long way, a little meditation goes a long way. 

No one can tell you what the next steps are, nursing school is for you to decide, only you know what is right. If you are already stressing, look at the stress and see if maybe you are meant to be doing something else entirely. Be ready to let go of things no longer serving your healing process.

The way I communicate intimately with the angels is I. adopt a concrete meaning for each number like “222 my dreams are coming true!” And that is what I think when I see it and I hold gratitude for what I have been dreaming about❤️ when I haven’t been dreaming then I look at my thoughts to see if I am unconsciously manifesting something, maybe my heart is desiring something I haven’t thought about.

I have adopted an attitude of “come what may.” My son is 12 days old and I am also having those feelings sometimes too. I check his chest a lot and worry about his color when he is frustratingly trying to poo. It’s all normal, we just want to see our babies thrive. Just trust that if they are meant to leave us there is nothing we can do to make them stay.

I got to a point that I could no longer handle anything, my mom was waiting to come home to my body, I barely got up just to eat and use the bathroom, I had a bed, I chose to sleep on the floor. I felt so bad about myself. It doesn’t matter if your s/o is disappointed or anything. What matters is that you start listening to yourself and listening to your needs. You hate yourself because you have no idea why you would be worthy of love because no one has ever shown you the love you need, the love you need is self acceptance. Accepting the way you feel. Your mind is not messed up, your mind is just hurting right now and is crying out for help to you. “Please please listen to me, I am hurting and I need someone to help” YOU can help. You can listen. You can. You can. You can. Even if you don’t believe it or feel it at first, repeat any of these things to yourself JUST to disrupt the negative thoughts. 

“I am love”

“I can and will meet my needs as they reveal themselves to me”

“What do I need?”

“What feels most supportive right now?”

“I am grateful even when it hurts”

“I am worthy”

“My feelings are valid”

Human, I love you, I want to see you heal because I have been healing since this similar experience for over two years now, you can’t see me physically, but I feel so much better now, I am healthy, I am grateful, I see myself as pure again. I am not perfect, but I know I am worth it. My true shift in perspective started when I was doing deliveries for a local grill, I would blast Bob Marley and just repeat, “I am love, I am love, I am love, I am love” and I reworked my brain to stop talking shit to me. 

I am sending you so much love and encouragement right now, you deserve to experience your own love and compassion. You are worthy of this healing. I love you. I love you. I love you. I am grateful for your life. I am grateful that you shared this introspective experience. You are not alone. ❤️"

We make choices and those choices affect everything. I choose to be kind because I want to live in a world full of kind people. I have been mean before because I was not aware of my own trauma, I was continuing the cycle of trauma. Oneness is not something that happens eventually, it is the realization that we have always been connected and will always be connected. There is nothing that happens on Earth that does not affect everyone to some degree. It’s all a dance of energy, sometimes it hurts, sometimes it feels amazing, and it’s always worth it. I hope this helps your perspective. You have an influence so when you do things that help yourself become healthier or happier, you help others be the same.
