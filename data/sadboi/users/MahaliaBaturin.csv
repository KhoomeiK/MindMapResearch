depression,fqi09jd,t3_ghdi7l,1589387629.0,"I can’t imagine not being depressed either... I have been struggling with it for 15 years now I realized the other day . And then i thought, how the fuck have i lived this long ? And how much longer will I be able to go on like this ? I would do anything to not feel like this . When I was younger I would have little breaks between my episodes . But it feels like I have been in one long episode for the past three years , which makes me feel even more sad and shitty because in these three years I gave birth to my son , he’s 2 now . And i feel like i haven’t been able to enjoy anything in my life . My friends who don’t have depression ... who Can just be awesome moms and not struggle to even leave the house or be social ......... I i wish I could be like them . I feel like maybe I shouldn’t be a mom , because How Can i do a good job when I am this sad .  I think about dying every day ."
