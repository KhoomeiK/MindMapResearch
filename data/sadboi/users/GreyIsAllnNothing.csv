BPD4BPD,fjhde1u,t3_fdcq14,1583345961.0,"Sad, angry, shame, fear (if Im using the emotions I was taught in ERGT). Feeling like I can't do anything right, lack of control over my actions, lack of energy to do the things I know I should do, that some will never let me have control over my life.
Coping this week has been difficult, mostly I try to avoid self harm. Have watched my favorite serie, having it on in the background while doing other things so I don't need to be alone with my mind. Talked to myself that everything's okay with as calm voice as I can. Petting my cat and doing everything to make him happy."
BPD4BPD,fiyn5yq,t1_fiyln25,1582842718.0,"Thank you. Really needed yo read that. Yeah Im trying to be healthier, but just as you said it seems like the more I try to control my esting the more control I loose. Thanks again, feels nice to get answers from someone who understands. 

Because my thought exactly was how I should starve myself to compensate but I just end up in this one step forward two step backwards scenario.

I know I need to deal with the emotions I have but sometimes it is just so overwhelming and I just want to feel safe, and the food does that, the first bite... then I can't stop, like my mind thinks maybe if I keep eating all will be well, but my body feels sick  but I continue... in the end I'm left feeling more unsafe because I can't trust myself even with a simple task like eating."
BPD4BPD,fiy8259,t1_fiy4k9j,1582834356.0,"Yeah... like I can starve myself, but if I eat just a small bite I become a black hole. Hard looking in the mirror and feeling this powerless."

Anxiety,etpir8n,t1_etphuoj,1563056569.0,"Thank you, I too have been to therapy and I hated doing those homework they gave me. Sometimes they made me worse because they asked things I simply couldn't answer, and I felt stupid and hated myself even more. It is easy to spiral down to self-hatred and even easier to hope someone can love us so we don't need to love ourselves. That makes it easy to enter relationships that are not good for us, that treat us as badly as we view ourselves. But don't think of it as a mistake, think of it as learning. From this you know what you need from a partner and you know what you want to improve about you before entering a new relationship. The person you were is a part of who you are now but you are so much more, all that pain is knowledge and understanding. Nothing ever can make that pain bearable but of you just manage to survive, you'll see that you can have one second of happiness, then a month later you have one minuter and then in a year you can be happy for days. Sometimes we fall but the further we go the more often those bright moments will come and then you can remind yourself that the dark does pass, even though it feels like that hate, loneliness and worthlessness is all there is. If you are in therapy you have asked for help, if you did that person you remember do want to live and be happy. You have come far and it will be a lot of work but I belive you can do it!"
Anxiety,etpgs12,t1_etp9n21,1563055036.0,"Don't be so hard on yourself. You are doing what you can with what you got. People with mental disorders have a greater challange than others so maybe going to the supermarket is something to be very very proud of. I recommend that you, when the anxiety kicks in, think about what triggered it, what emotions did you feel, ccept them and think about what they tell you. Maybe you are sad because you miss something, maybe you are angry because someone stepped over your territory. Do not see them as ways to selfhate but rather understand yourself so that you can give yourself a change to aim for a life that doesn't require more of you than you feel you can do. But maybe now, give you and your dog a treat and just enjoy all the senses around you."
