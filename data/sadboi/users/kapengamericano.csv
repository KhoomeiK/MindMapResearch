I‚Äôm a nursing student (supposed to be grad and would-be nurse) I don‚Äôt know if I should be thankful that I get to stay in quarantine or feel guilty cause I‚Äôm not in the frontlines knowing my friends already are. But anyway, your service to humanity is appreciated and I‚Äôm proud of what you do. 

Happy Birthday."

I didn‚Äôt realize how weak I still am until after the lockdown happened and I had no choice but to improvise with bodyweight training at home. I wasn‚Äôt much hyped about the compounds though, but I will do tons of accessory/isolation works haha. I guess I‚Äôm more focused on hypertrophy than strength gains :/ 

Thanks! Doing pull ups ain‚Äôt easy but progression is key. Hope you‚Äôre motivated to do the same üòÑ"

DoesAnybodyElse,fnjjd0m,t3_g24ndf,1587000183.0,I‚Äôm on the same boat. Never really had compassion for anything emotional. And sometimes I would even feel the opposite. They annoy me and I make a laugh out of them. It‚Äôs mostly about sarcasm or maybe a type of defense mechanism. It actually made me less anxious being that way.
