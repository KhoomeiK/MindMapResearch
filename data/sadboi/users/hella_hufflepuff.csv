Anxiety,fc4gaa2,t3_eff73c,1577415801.0,"My three year relationship ended earlier this year for very similar reasons. I’m hearing you and I relate. But it’s been 10 months, and I’m doing extremely well. There is light at the end of the dark tunnel. Here’s what helped me. 

-	No contact with your ex. At minimum for 30 days. I let myself contact him again after the initial 30 to make sure he was sure, and that was the last time we spoke. Shoot for those 30 days, go longer if you can. I journaled things I wanted to say to him to get through this period. 
-	Go to therapy. Go. To. Therapy. I wish I would have done this earlier. It helped so much to have a safe space to cry over it and process everything on a regular basis. 
-	Find a hobby. It can be anything. I chose walking my dogs everyday. 
-	r/breakups was really helpful for me. I found a community there and communicated with a few people going through the same things on WhatsApp for awhile. It was nice to feel understood. 
-	Just hang in there. For the love of god hang in there. I was incredibly depressed for a few months following my breakup. It happens, it’s ok, and it’s valid. Just see it through."

Anxiety,ex8u5t2,t3_crrb2s,1566078938.0,"Maybe not the most helpful answer, but I’ve always felt like my anxiety can cause me to be depressed. Like whenever I can’t do something because I’m anxious or get embarrassed about how overly upset I get over something, it tends to give me feelings of depression. It’s very situational in the sense that it’s brought on by feeling stopped and less than because of my anxiety."

Anxiety,ex8ti4t,t3_crrv97,1566078675.0,"I think this is hard to give advice on because it’s difficult to see what the root of the problem is - as always with anxiety, I know. My point is though - is there anything specific making you anxious about your boyfriend? Are you scared of a future with him, are you worried you don’t love him anymore, has there been a recent change in your relationship? If you can answer any of these questions, I think that could help with deciding what direction you should go on. I know with my anxiety I always struggle with jumping to conclusions and making decisions that aren’t related to the actual problem at hand. So my concern here is your recent spike in anxiety has nothing to do with your boyfriend, and thus ending the relationship would do little to fix your problems. 

Therapy is definitely a good option for you before making any huge decisions. Talk this out with a professional."

AskWomen,ex7fu82,t3_crl1gt,1566059889.0,"The best thing I did for myself after a rough breakup was start going to therapy. I felt really silly about it at the time, but having that safe space every other week to talk about it and cry it out really helped me. 

I’m also a big believer of “fake it till you make it”. Basically some days I just forced myself to do things that “old me” would have done, and usually once I got myself out there I would feel more like myself again, even if it was only temporary. 

Hang in there OP. Breakups are rough. Cut yourself some slack."
