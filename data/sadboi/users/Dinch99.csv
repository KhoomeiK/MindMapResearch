depression_help,fk3gmnx,t3_fg5yii,1583832577.0,"Remind her that you love her, ask if she's OK and try do things for her/with her that you know she likes.
Also make sure she is talking to a doctor and getting a proper support system (one that isn't just you) and remember that you can't fix everything for her or bear  all this alone because it's really hard.

Maybe family therapy could be a consideration, if your parents are willing? Just to get your parents to talk things out without arguing and some pressure can be relieved from you.

Stay strong, you're doing great and your mum is blessed to have you. I hope she is OK x"

Also for flights I always use sky scanner to find the best deals.
