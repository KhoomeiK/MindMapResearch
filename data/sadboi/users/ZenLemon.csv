FF7 always was the most interesting to me so maybe i should try to tackle it next. But if your comment you really got me interested into trying Final Fantasy IX for some reason. I love good worldbuilding, so if it has a lot of interesting lore to present, might actually get hooked. Final Fantasy XIII was something i thought i gonna get into Final Fantasy, i really love the soundtrack, Lightning looks cool and the theme was something i wanted to explore, but i heard a lot of negativity, but if the story really that good, i see no problem. Corridors are not bad in my opinion if they are done right, but this might not be that, but good story usually beats the gameplay for me.


As for Final Fantasy XV i think the main story can be beaten in 20+ hours as howlongtobeat.com says. I think the game does pretty good job if you want just to complete the story and sidequests seems purely optional.



And usually myself can't spare time for 100+ hour games, as i constantly have projects or studies take a lot of time, but this quarantine gave me more free time then i ever asked for. Always try to look for games i can complete during a weekend as i can't make pauses through games as they take my immersion away, but i think there is plenty good games that doesn't take up that much time :).



Thank you for your answer! Looking forward for the next game i going to play! Thinking about IX next :)!"

Jrpg's really not my thing, but with action added in it it's pretty fun. Has quite some flaws in my opinion, but some parts are really polished which are really fun. Never thought i wouldn't be using fast travel that much. I love just putting the car in auto and just sitting in the back and relaxing, listening to some great soundtracka from previous games, watching the landscape, stoping to take a picture or to refill the fuel for the car or just getting something to eat before reaching destination. It lacks more dialoge in the car, but it's still nice. The Regalia (the car) is definitelly one of my favourite characters in the game. What i also love about the game is amazing dungeon design. They are quite linear most of the time, but they all look different, feel different. Easier dungeons are fun to blast trough or harder putting up a nice challange. Even i had to revisit one dungeon three times and took like 5/6 hours to complete with some insanely over the top fights i hated, i still had a blast and felt really rewarding. Level 64 and still in chapter 6 out of 14. I'm skipping more uninteresting sidequests, but i don't feel like skipping anything. Can't wait to complete the story."
gamedesign,fm8gegn,t1_fm8fejp,1585848926.0,"Like i said too much effects on the text. It reminds of police because of the background lights and the metal texture on the S.K.I.D.

As i presume you don't have adobe cloud, but in case you do, check out adobe fonts. There are many amazing fonts from top notch level designers. For a totally free library check out fonts.google.com . There are tons of good hand selected fonts and all of them are free for personal and commercial use so no problem about licensing.

Most of the stuff that the others mentioned of course and as graphic designer i was really disappointed to see the logo. It could use some heavy work, because right now it looks like from pre 2010's racing game on consoles. It's the future man, logos are getting more and more cleaner and simpler mostly. Try to get rid of all the effects on it, leave it plain, maybe a gentle gradient, if you want details add something to the letter shape it'self rather than adding rusted or brushed metal. If logo would look more modern, i bet it would look way much more professional. Sorry for hard critique, but i do it in hope of your success! Try looking at some [r/cyberpunks logos](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/search/?q=logo&sort=top&restrict_sr=on&t=all&count=26&before=t3_7ism6w) , they're mostly graphic, but might find some inspiration.

  What you should do instead if you are using reference is to redraw and study the shapes you draw. I didn't know how to draw hands at all, but learned to draw at least believable hands over a day. I never thought i could reach such results ao quickly. i watched a video on it and just used my own hand for reference, analized how it works, what shapes it's made off and how others analize it.

DigitalArtTutorials,fhbft9p,t3_f1vv0a,1581441413.0,"Hey, im new to digital art myself and been struggling to learn for a while myself, since i hardly search for learning material, but over time i found myself some nice things to help me in learning and some things i wish i knew earlier. But firstly i got a graphic tablet as a motivation to begin and i think it's totally fundamental, a must. I got used Wacom Intuos m since i had chance to try it for a while, and decided that it works for me. I really enjoy the ring you can adjust some settings easily.
  
  
  
  Like someone mentioned earlier, autodesk sketchbook pro. It's free and simple to use interface, fun to play around and great for starters. Always recommend to anyone who just started out.  
  
  
  Brushes. Find out some basic brush. One for line art and another for shading (also depends on styles and so on you are trying to achieve, but i decided that to get used to tablet, learning the fundamentals again are quite usefull). When i used to try to shade it looked horrible, shameful to share, when i saw some videos and found myself the ""Brush"". Which also means to use the pressure of the pen. At first i turned it off, until i learned how useful for the workflow and makes me feel more free, while drawing.  
  
  
  And for lasts is youtube. I never liked watching youtube videos to learn, but decided to give it a shot and seen a lot of different artist, but nothing helped me as [Sinix Design](https://www.youtube.com/user/sinixdesign). Especially this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zC3OxonJcXQ&t), as it did not taught me how to paint, but as well as what i need.  
  
  
  Of course everyone has different methods and you may find your process different, but i share mine in hope to help you out. Maybe reading material or teachers is your way to learn, so just try what you think will be most helpful, suitable for you. But like mentioned before, graphic tablet is a must unless you do pixel art which works perfectly with a mouse as well, or you work with vector art, but for drawing, mouse is a hard no no.

worldbuilding,faf5vsl,t3_e8ck2p,1576015200.0,"Well it might not be the worst crime but it's pretty strict in the central states. I present magic.




 Magic is forbidden because of the church. The main religion believes that magic is a godly power and no one who is mortal should be allowed to learn or use magic. This rule was thought out of fear, but not really anyone knows about it. At first the church just though, that it is not fair, it can kill someone, so it was a hard no for them. Since magic is so ""dangerous"" there are only few exceptions to use it. You have to have a permit and for it you have to have a reason. Some blacksmiths for example can have a helper fire mage to help him forge, court can have divination mage to check facts, and if you don't have such reason, you are forcefully taken into army. But if you use magic outside your purpose or try to avoid army you are getting deported into an island in the middle of the ocean.

Another thing i could suggest, but hit this thought still quite early in the worldbuilding process is to make a tabletop rpg. You said you played roleplaying games in your childhood and it's probably more popular now than ever (thanks to various tv series) you could hit this road. r/rpgdesign is another great community about making tabletop rpg's and it's quite a hobby. I been working on my own for few years now, but it really depends on how much time you can spare on it. You can make it simple (but i imagine you like way more detailed stuff), you can make it really advanced. The story isn't a must as common lore the the mechanics are, and it can be as much fun as writing a world.

Maybe few tips would be:
Play around fort joy and try to complete most sidequests and explore, thats the part where you will learn how it works. Don't rush.


If you lost a battle, load and try again. Sometimes different tactics helps a ton, rethink your strategies, try to get your ranged characters above ground, think of different aproach and gear up if able. If you still can't beat it, it might be to early to fight it, level up a bit.


Think creatively. There are so many ways around things. You can brake down doors and chests if you want, you can teleport objects and move them from afar with telekinesis and makes one of the must fun part of the game personally. The different terrain and cloud types could also give you a huge advantage in combat, like for example, lighting up oil with fire or electrocuting puddles.


Save often, you can even do it during conversations. Also while one character speaks, you can switch characters and play as them as the one speaking works as distraction. And suggest having pet pal perk from the start for first time since talking with animals will get you quests and more conversations.

For intro i suggest just a simple animation Monster Hunter related and the music could be something out of the series, so i hope to see something similiar. I remember doing a trailer overview pointing things out and i just didn't upload it because i was scared of  people hearing my voice, but i'm glad you did talk anyway. It might take more times, you can record your voice in segments and your voice works just fine so don't be weirded out and be natural, we all hear our voice differently.  I will look forward for your videos and turn on notifications so i could give more feedback in the future if you would prefer so, as i love seeing channels grow. So best of luck on that!

As for the feedback i understand you very much. I create different content (not videos, board game, music and graphic design), so it's nothing worse than not getting any criticism. Im glad i have some people around me being brutally honest which led me to grow and improve on things i do, i know my mistakes and i try my best not to repeat them and finally i feal like i understand most of my things and can manage on my own more easily. I improved my aesthetic view on things and while im not as good as some other creators i can still point out mistakes and feel how it could be improved, so letting people tell the truth of what they think makes us going further instead of being stuck in one place. Reddit usually is a great place for criticism depending on the community, so try out different subs if you want to get more feedback on your content. 

So i'll hope to see your channel grow and good luck on this adventure you'll be having!"

Barioth is just something i wanted back a lot and hoped so much for in iceborne and it will happened! Fun and cool fight and those gorgeous g rank armor of his!  Shagaru Magala looks sweet and it was my favourite monster to hunt. I just loved how action packed the hunt always was and trying not to cart as much. And Mizutsune is aestheticly pleasing and just love how it looks.


About your channel:
There is a lot work to put in and things to think about. You said your channel focuses on Monster Hunter, so why have dubstep and logo like this in the intro? Why most people even stay in the intro tropes, because it feels annoying and you don't expect as much. Videos are alright, but you'll improve, you should speak more and i get the hype over Barioth, but really it wasn't informative. All we found out is that you're really excited and it's fun. I suggest putting more work into it, introducing his first gen, more about his attack patterns in that gen and so on. But i believe you have potential, so i'll just wish you luck!"

worldbuilding,eoj0fb0,t3_bs1s5k,1558630993.0,"Looks really aestheticly pleasing. 
 The colors are nice and smooth. Even it kinda looks kinda empty, or like too smooth, not sure how to phrase this feeling, but that what makes it even more interesting for me. Every city and location, whats up there, whats in the mare, what can you find in Odragia and Meaurana and whats happening way up in the north. Looking at this i just want to explore it and mark every location on the map.


 But the best part is, It's not boring. It's your own unique piece of art which is not inkarnate or wonderdraft. Those are great tools, but what happens that every map starts to look the same.

 Conclusion is, it's pleasing to the eyes, the colors are lovely, it looks interesting and it's not a mapmaking software. Thank you for your map! I hope to see more from you in the future!"

RPGdesign,eobicy3,t1_eo9nlck,1558442795.0,"Like u/Hytheter pointed out. It's not forcing a weapon type on a pc, you just add this mechanic to weapons itself. You can just make weapon x having some kind of disadvantage while fighting someone with weapon y or add advantage when weapon y fighting against weapon x or both. The advantage and disadvantage can be anything from adding or removing a fixed amount of damage or hit rolls, or add an extra dice and so on."
