Start by adding a litter box. You need 1 per cat plus 1.

Is your cat drinking water? Do you have a water fountain? Get one. $15 on amazon. Check my post history for recommendation of the brand.

What food is your cat eating? You need a urinary tract health food. My cat is on a very expensive prescription diet and my other cat is on the only OTC urinary diet I could find online in my area. 

How often are you replacing and scooping litter? If you’re not doing one of those things every day, up your schedule.

Do you have a feliway diffuser? Get one. Plug it in.

If your cat is lethargic, has severe personality changes, is sensitive about their belly, in/out of the box, vomiting, crying at the box, in/out without using, marking outside of the box - vet immediately, ASAP. Damn your budget. Read more about potential urinary symptoms online now. Educate yourself. This is very hard to see until it’s BAD.

Cats hide pain very well and if they have a blockage you’re looking at a $2k bill in the US, minimum, and you will never be insured for it in the future. Your insurance will require 6 months of payment before you can get a FLUTD issue insured. I’m not saying let your cat suffer. Absolutely not. But make changes in your life now to mitigate potential FATAL AND SILENT AND VERY SERIOUS issues with your cat. 

We’ve spent over $3500 USD to rectify this issue in our cat and while he’s seemingly out of the woods today, he could relapse at any moment and I cannot get it insured. In the current economical climate it’s even more stressful. He’s my best friend and I will always do what I can but it’s miserable and traumatizing to see your pet lay down to expect to die."
Pets,foy5p21,t3_ga1a6m,1588165905.0,"We got the PETRIP cat drinking water fountain from Amazon about a month ago and my cats love it. My one cat still likes the sink, but as a treat.

She’s trained to not be on the kitchen counter. I just gently picked her up and put her on the floor as many times as it took for her to not be up there and now I can just make this buzzer-like “No” sound and she will stop what she’s doing.

When we bought it I took the “sprout” attachment off and just had the bubbler going. I pulled it out from the shelf we keep it on and sat with both of my cats and calmly touched the water and gave them a few drops, then pointed to the fountain, and they drank. I slowly graduated to the full trickle, and now they’re both drinking more water than they used to, which is great because my male cat has FLUTD.

I think they also have some drops you can add to the water that will help attract your cats to it if you’re very committed. But I think me just showing them that it’s safe and delicious fresh water really helped. My male is very picky about everything including the temperature of his water and size of his bowl and he loves the fountain."
HistoricPreservation,folrjd9,t3_g84b4g,1587868792.0,"It depends on what you might want to end up doing, but at a bachelor level you’re probably looking to build skills to fill out your flexibility for future employment. If that is the case, an architecture minor would probably not help much, unless the coursework for the minor included a history and theory course, a drafting course, and a materials and methods course. However, architecture minors are typically design focused rather than technology focused. I would recommend considering something in public administration, communications, pre-law or construction management. These would help you learn more flexible skills to flesh out your primary degree. 

Then if you do decide to do something in architecture you could pursue it for a masters degree and the coursework that’s behind you will support that very well.  It’s just, architecture school is vastly different than professional practice, and a minor will probably not be as beneficial as some of the other paths I mentioned.

Now that they’re both on new food (and reduced calories), they’re not crying by the feeders or waiting on the next meal. I don’t think it’s a timing thing but it might be the food change?

There’s probably a quick fix, but there may be a more serious underlying issue (moisture from the basement, potentially, or some structural settlement from the floor joists). The only way to be sure is to do some investigative work in the crawlspace.


You will probably at least want to engage at three separate contractors with wood flooring experience and get a quote from each. With three quotes, you’ll be able to make sure that you’re getting an accurate estimate. You don’t necessarily need to go with the lowest so long as there’s at least one other quote that’s close. In my experience one of the three will either be insanely low or insanely high based on the other two. That’s the one you will ignore - they’re either taking advantage of your inexperience in this realm or they’re missing something important in their quote that you’ll pay for later.


If the quotes come back all different, (if you’re in the United States) call your State Historic Preservation Officer (every state has one) and they can help you navigate the differences. Maybe you should call your SHPO regardless. Depending on the level of repair required you may need the help of a preservationist or architect to ensure your money and building are advocated for during construction.


To find contractors with wood flooring experience, a good start would be another regional theater that may have been built or renovated recently, or even any regional school districts - they usually have a wood flooring person who refinishes their floors and could recommend someone.


When they do their quote, they’ll need access to the crawlspace and they may even ask to pull up a small portion of the floor to inspect. Obviously this won’t be possible if you’re in a performing season and could cause additional damage. If that’s not an option until the actual construction begins, then you need to plan a 20% contingency fund (rather than a typical 10%-15%) into your fundraising, because with older buildings, they will always find something when construction starts.

Squashes  - if you’re brave - for zucchini or yellow squash, try searing it on high heat for 3-4 minutes with just a little bit of oil flesh side (white innard side) down in a pan with salt, pepper, and herbs. If you cook it flesh side up the skin kind of retains the moisture like a little boat and it gets soggy. For spaghetti, acorn, butternut, etc type squashes, I roast flesh side down for about 30-45 minutes in the oven and then season however I feel.  This will keep them from being so watery.

Mushrooms - if you can do them right they’re amazing- I cook sliced mushrooms in no oil until their juices release and then add 1/4 cup of broth or water and a splash of soy or Worcestershire sauce, pepper, and garlic, then cook down until the liquid is almost gone.

It’s pretty versatile at this point but I can recommend adding some cooked chicken, lemon juice, (I would say feta but you say you don’t like strong cheeses) mozzarella cheese, and some tomatoes to it once you pull it out of the oven. Or treat it like a burrito rice bowl and top it how you like. Or put some stir fry on it. Just use it like rice. It’s not a rice substitute by any means but it works well that way. Don’t cook it in a pan - it gets too watery.

Turnips, carrots, parsnips, potatoes (sweet and regular), and other root vegetables can all be used somewhat interchangeably and are so good simply roasted with some salt and pepper."
Old_Recipes,erigcpf,t1_erdvail,1560896971.0,"My great aunt was making goulash on the stove, which was bubbling, and she was stirring occasionally.

She was also making a chocolate cake.

Her dog ran through the kitchen and startled her, and she jumped, spilling a full ladle of goulash in the cake.

She said, “oh well!” and finished baking the cake. Everyone who had the cake said it was the best cake they’ve ever had!!"
WestVirginia,eqkr71r,t3_byoie4,1560129371.0,"Definitely check out the Purple Fiddle when you’re in the Cranberry/Dolly Sods area. And when you go to the Greenbrier, consider checking out Lewisburg and grabbing dinner and staying there instead of paying for food and lodging at the resort (though the Greenbrier is very cool to stay at and has lots of amenities and the food is excellent. It’s just expensive in general).

I hope you’ve planned on renting a car for your entire stay. There is no public transportation for you to use in the state that’s worth a damn."
weddingplanning,eq16v8b,t1_epz0i9o,1559702397.0,"Maybe you should call a few of your aunts/uncles/cousins yourself and talk to them. My mom pulls this stuff on me a lot (and did it to me during my wedding) and it turns out it was just her making that decision rather than anyone else.

Is there a quiet room at your venue that you could set up a lounge seating area in, or just a large table area far from the dance floor? Maybe if you conveyed a more “casual” hang out area for them and you talked to people directly rather than through your mom, you’ll find out that everyone would like to stay a little later.

Or, is it the late night drive that she’s worried about? Can you afford to get her a room somewhere for the night of the rehearsal dinner so she attends that at least?

If it makes you feel any better, my mom did not attend my rehearsal dinner. I was quite upset but the day of, I found there were several other people there from other facets of my life and that was more than enough to keep me busy. Do I wish that my mom and her family had taken some time to get to know my husband’s family? Sure. But it wouldn’t have changed the fact they live 300 miles away from each other and they’ll never see each other again probably."

There’s a ton of shops on Etsy that will personalize them for you - I think I spent $15/bridesmaid and put some cute odds and ends in each. Just be sure to order them well in advance of the wedding. 

I just saw one of my bridesmaids using hers a few weeks ago and it’s been almost 2 years."
