depression,fqa92ci,t1_fq8ozfm,1589214982.0,"This whole comment is a load of projects and assumptions about non-depressed people. You're judging when you should never judge because you have no fucking idea what's happened in their life. It was so frustrating reading your comment that I was compelled to reply. You know nothing about other people and their circumstances so why are you projecting your pewny understanding of life into others?
If you really want to have a taste of what being excited, joyful and happy is DO NOT JUDGE ANYONE and focus on the story you're living instead. 
End rant."
depression,flhj1u7,t1_fle3dw2,1585163597.0,"I have to completely disagree with the method you're using. I know it brings you a feeling of comfort but it will in no way help you overcome your depression/anxiety. You're relinquishing all power to the ""disease"" and none for yourself.

1. Don't compare yourself to ANYONE. We are all living and doing the best we can with the traumas we carry and the social conditioning we've learned. 
The most important step a man can take is the NEXT one not the first.

2. Your failure to do anything depends 100% on YOU and that's not a bad thing! We have this negative connotation with failing but we are the ones who have failed the most we know what not to do. 


3. Own and accept EVERYTHING that has happened in your life. That is the first step in climbing out of depression/anxiety. When you own and accept everything and who you currently are you can then make choices on how to better your life situation"
depression,flhaen9,t1_flh1ojx,1585159028.0,"The last 2-2.5 years have been my personal journey from massive life crushing depression to truly loving myself and starting my own business.

The 3 üóùÔ∏ès to loving yourself:

1. Journey before destination
When you start to look inward you're going to discover some real cool and also horrible shit. Be patient with yourself in accepting everything that has happened to you and will happen. Don't control the waves of life, surf on the fucker

2. Live here and NOW
When you are deep in thought (whether it's good or bad) you are living life on autopilot. You aren't making the choices that truly define your future when you're stuck in thoughts. There are many techniques to train yourself to become aware that you've ""drifted"" and ground yourself. 

3. Help someone daily
If you are feeling LAZY, USELESS or DEPRESSED or all 3! Do 1 thing to help someone every day. Answer a question on a subreddit, donate to a charitable cause, call a family member that could use a call. ANYTHING this is game changing here and if you do this you WILL see results"
depression,flh95no,t1_flgk3sx,1585158378.0,"Nothing you do in this world will MAKE you happy. Happiness is a choice, a decision to accept the present moment without thinking of your past traumas or future anxieties. If you choose to 'not think' about anything and just be content right now even for just a few seconds you can feel happiness"
depression,flh8sw8,t1_flgo7bk,1585158193.0,Agreed! Comments like that do not help at all. They don't fathom how that feels when you say that. In my case my turning point was the immense desire to stop suffering...and I did :)

depression,flh8gh5,t1_flgueqt,1585158010.0,"The journey to begin to love yourself is one of noticing who you are, accepting EVERYTHING about you and peeling back the layers of ""mental"" defense you've consciously or unconsciously placed to live reality as just you and nothing else (no social conditioning, traumas, etc...) 
This is a comment from someone who climbed out of a deep depression and over two years learned to truly love himself. 
Stay strong and stay present that's your üóùÔ∏è"
bodyweightfitness,fiaenlf,t1_fiaeb9u,1582299466.0,"It all depends on where you are inflexible. There's no 1 stretch fits all. For example I have great hip flexibility but my hamstrings are hella tight. 
Also with stretching if you're feeling pain you're stretching too much. Once you feel sensation in the stretch it's doing its job.

Start with static stretches breathing deeply and hold each stretch for at least 30sec."
