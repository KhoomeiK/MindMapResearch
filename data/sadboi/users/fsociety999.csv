Vegan food is pretty deficient in protein. Not bashing on Veganism (even though I dont think its healthy) just stating facts.

chicken breast per 100g has around 20g of protein.

200g of chicken is like 40g of protein, and only like 200 calories.

However, a veggie burger might have 200 calories and 15g of protein.

You catch my drift?

edit: After seeing your post history its clear you have some kind of ED. Ive been there.

Cutting/Dieting is not what you want to do, not when you are this slim. In fact, I concurrently have image issues also so I can relate and understand your POV.
