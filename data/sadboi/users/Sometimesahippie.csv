They kept on saying that it very well may be too early, but what was confusing me is the fact that my doctor at another office said I was only a few weeks along, and before they even looked at me the nurse said I should be 7 weeks along...it was just unnerving to hear two totally different numbers from them I suppose; feels like no one knows what‚Äôs up with me. 

I haven‚Äôt had any bleeding or spotting at all, but I did have a severe cramp at night last week that was unlike anything I‚Äôve felt, but I‚Äôve been fine since. I hate this waiting game, but I appreciate your comments and sharing your experience. Thank you for offering to be an ear as well!!!"
pregnant,fr4vidh,t1_fr4ulju,1589897668.0,"They thought I was 7+ weeks along at the hospitals obgyn before the ultrasound (my doctors office doesn‚Äôt have that machine), but my main doctor had said I was only 2-3 weeks along in an appt I had last Friday. My last period was in late March, and I didn‚Äôt have one in April, but according to my Flo app, my peak ovulation was at the end of April. I am just super confused because I had taken a test two weeks ago and it was negative, and then this past week I took four and they were all positive. 

My bloodwork came back today from getting it done yesterday, and my hormone levels are over 400 which I think is good? Now they are just having me get bloodwork done tomorrow and probably beyond to see if it rises if I heard that correctly. I honestly think I am just a few weeks pregnant, I‚Äôm almost certain due to the volume in which we were trying to conceive in late April that that is when I ultimately got pregnant, but my last period says otherwise which makes it confusing.

Edit: I know they are trying to be careful and monitor me but it is just scary when I haven‚Äôt had a baby or been pregnant before. I just want to make sure I‚Äôm doing everything right and understanding correctly."

Grocery shopping vs a bar is a bit different just because with a store, yes there are risks, but the expectation (at least in my state) is that you‚Äôre in and out w/ a mask as soon as you can while getting what you need. A bar tends to have people stay there for a length of time, lots of touching with glasses, menus maybe, chairs, tables, bathrooms, AC, etc. I understand the frustration of all of this, I‚Äôve been inside my apartment 95% of the time since March 15, and it‚Äôs been miserable at points. The bottom line is that we all want to get back to normal, but since there is a baby involved and your health, id maybe consult a doctor to get their opinion and have another talk; there are just too many unknowns right now to have him blow this off as not a big deal. Good luck, I hope everything works out okay and you find a common ground or understand together.
