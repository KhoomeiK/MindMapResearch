I've not contacted her since the last message I sent her just asking for answers, and even said if you need space, that's fine just tell me. The only thing I will struggle with is the ""not looking for answers"" part, I don't know whether it's my personality (or just BPD!), but I automatically think things are my fault and will back down and do anything to try and make it up to people. So not knowing what the issue is will be really difficult for me.

As for why I always end up with people like this in my life...I don't know. Right now I believe that this is what *all* people are like, and it's safer to keep everyone at a distance so this doesn't happen again. My mum always  said ""you are the company that you keep"", so either I'm also just a shitty person, or I'm not that bad but super unlucky!!!
