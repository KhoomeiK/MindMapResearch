Your subject matter is kind of...boring. but, I believe drawing and painting boring stuff is a good way to sharpen skills for when you find the thing that starts to define your style.

And if you take away anything from any of this... Art is subjective and art is therapeutic. If you enjoy doing it, keep making it."

I'm at a point now where I usually have $10 left over at the end of the week"

Parenting,fkat4q9,t3_fha7ze,1584018821.0,"Similar situation about 2 years again. 3 year throwing a shit fit in front of everyone....in a drs office... Well, and OT office, so many parents there could relate. 

But I wasn't giving in. I think it was about putting on a coat. The *one* mom that stepped up to help me is actually one of the few people in my day to day life that I loathe. (We see each other at OT, scouts, baseball, school in general...plus I graduated with her....ugh)

But, shit I needed someone. There wasnt much I could do about shit-fit-shelia when I couldn't put my infant anywhere safe (because bucket carseats are so pedestrian..) and how do you say ""no thanks, I'll just make everyone watch and listen to this tantrum""? 

It was a weird moment. I still don't like her. But she did gain some points that day."

But yes, it's entirely possible to have meds that seem to give the opposite effect or make it worse. Tell your Dr. They will tell you if it's something that can go away after getting used to the meds or if it needs to stop and you go to a different med. 

Tl;Dr :: Call and tell your dr"

If it is an issue that lasts more than 5 days, I point it out. When it gets intense (throwing things) I call him out right then and there. I know his hangups are a cause of it. But I'm not going to let him get away with it"

It was even written in a work review once. I think I'm married only because my husband has low self esteem and probably thinks he can't do better. I try to be better, but kindness doesn't come naturally for me.

My mom has bipolar and she's a fucking piece of shit. Abusive and manipulative. She crosses boundaries and for everything still has never apologized. At this point in her life, she just blames all her shortcomings on ""her illness"". She'll never say what it is out loud. 

My best friend in high school used to sleep over at my house all the time because her dad would beat her. It seemed to come and go with his cycles. She has forgiven him, I haven't..."

Anyway, I think the back to back pregnancies and year+ long nursing triggered anxiety for sure and quite possibly a constant mixed state.

It's my understanding that the typical way to treat is to calm the mania, then lift the mood out of depression. 

I will say, I do feel like some of the things that I identified as... The uniqueness I had .. my drive and creativity... It's suppressed. I'm not empty. I just feel normal now"

I'm mildly offended by this being as I'm from Ohio and we have native species to plant. I'll be honest I don't know the name(s). But I see it on trails and many local organizations give out the seeds that they prepare from previous years plants."
