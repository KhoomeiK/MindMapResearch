Talking a few times a week at work. Finally got the nerve to ask her out after it was obvious for months she liked me. A few days after our first date, she got fucked over hard by immigration issues(hasn’t worked since then, work authorization expired, and citizenship stuff halted). The court dates got delayed by the Iran(she is middle eastern, US stopped most immigration stuff from there) stuff earlier this year, and then COVID. It was supposed to be settled in Oct of last year near when we met, but that got delayed too. And to add onto that, her toxic parents don’t let her leave the house without them, and she can’t move out since she can’t work, and her car has been out of commission about a month after we met, and again not work = no money to fix it. Nothing’s changed for her and we still talk a few times a week, but I still can’t help but think what could’ve been every single day."
