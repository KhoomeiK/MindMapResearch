AmItheAsshole,fq61fzo,t1_fq60v86,1589122480.0,"I would accept I’m wrong except I feel I haven’t gotten myself across very well. I have done so much for his family. The last time when his mom was seriously sick, forget calling, I came over and cooked for the family I cleaned and did laundry. And then she has an upset tummy and I didn’t call her and that’s enough to offend? For all holidays I get everyone gifts. There are somethings I’m even uncomfortable with liking kissing people on the cheek, but I know his grandmas wouldn’t understand my discomfort and might find it rude so I do it anyway. I learnt the language just to be able to communicate better with his grandparents because in all other aspects I don’t need to use the language of that country. 

After taking everything into context, I find it silly that a woman would be offended if her nephews foreigner girlfriend didn’t wish her Mother’s Day. I’d do it of course, making a phone call isn’t a big deal to ask someone how they’re feeling or say happy Mother’s Day, but to know someone would get offended at you if you didn’t is too much for me. I have a busy life and if he asks me, I’ll do it, but I can’t be expected to care for these small traditions so religiously. Now if you say I’m still an asshole, I’ll really accept it. But I feel like they’ve forgotten that Their traditions and norms don’t come naturally to me. They shouldn’t be offended if I unknowingly don’t do something."
AmItheAsshole,fq60uvk,t1_fq5yt4c,1589122119.0,"Like I said. It’s not a big deal to check. I’ve done way more than just check-in in the past. I’ve cooked and cleaned for her when she was sick. I’ve brought food over. His family is closer to me than my family. I love them greatly. 

I have adapted more than anyone should be expected to. I would happily have called her to check in if it was a big deal for her. But the fact that my boyfriend told me that she said if I didn’t call, it would be so rude and inappropriate. That ticked me off because all she had was an upset tummy. I have adapted so much and done so much for their family. If she was seriously sick of course I would have called. To think that something small like that would have been considered rude is a bit petty in my opinion. To think that if I didn’t call his aunt for Mother’s Day, when I haven’t spoken to the woman since December, that she would be offended at me, it’s petty. I don’t believe people should have such strict and black and white ways of living. Considering how much I’ve done for them this is a silly thing to be offended at."
AmItheAsshole,fq60d8c,t1_fq606sr,1589121813.0,"Wow. Easy there. I never said woe is me. It’s a super minor issue in our relationship and my life. 

But thank you the way you talk, and your colorful language has definitely convinced me I’m an asshole you should be so proud of your conversation style. Good day."
AmItheAsshole,fq5ylje,t1_fq5y7p8,1589120690.0,"I have adapted to everyone. When his mom was actually sick, I cleaned the entire house for her did everyone’s laundry cooked them meals. I celebrate all their holidays buy them gifts. Then if it’s something so small like not calling her up for an upset stomach makes her feel offended, I find that ridiculous. 

I am more abiding of his traditions and familial norms than I am of my own, and I felt the need to draw a line to remind him that ultimately he’s dating a foreigner. His family cannot have the same expectations of me as they would of a local girl. Not to the point where his aunt would get offended if I don’t call her. If you read properly you would see that I said I wouldn’t mind calling up 4-5 people and wishing them, but him saying that they will be offended if I don’t is ridiculous."
AmItheAsshole,fq5ybcf,t1_fq5y1xs,1589120505.0,It’s just in light of the fact that I have adapted myself so much. Sometimes they even joke that j should get a citizenship considered how traditional I am. Then when they get offended at something as minor as this it annoys me. I’m trying ffs. He never had to try so it’s a bit selfish of him to criticize me.
AmItheAsshole,fq5y7wx,t1_fq5xxkp,1589120441.0,"Well I think you’re assuming way too much about me here. You did clearly miss that part since you’re not really curious about the things I do make sure to do. 

When she was actually sick, I came over to their house cleaned the whole place did laundry I cooked for 2 days so she could rest. Whenever it is a traditional holiday, I make sure to buy gifts for everyone even in the extended family because it is a norm. I would happily call someone if they’re sick, but the fact that if I don’t it’s considered rude of me when all they had was a sick stomach is a bit too much. I get a sick stomach all the time I don’t get offended if family and friends don’t call up to check on me. If they do that’s sweet but I know everyone has their own life."
AmItheAsshole,fq5xy6s,t1_fq5xjof,1589120264.0,"I guess I do sound unkind here but I think that’s only because of how frustrated I am right now. If his mother was sick as she has been before, I come over and I did all the cleaning of the house I made food for everyone for 2 days so she could rest. So when it comes to small things like calling her up to check on her when her stomach was upset, in light of all the other ways I’ve adapted to, I find it unnecessary that it’s something she would be offended at if I didn’t do. Like okay I would do it out of the niceness of my own heart but I don’t like that it’s sort of an expectation that if I don’t do it’s considered rude."
AmItheAsshole,fq5xhoh,t1_fq5x6qb,1589119953.0,"I think you’re missing the part where I say I have adapted to his family and their culture to a greater degree than could have been expected of me. I celebrate his holidays more than my own. I always attend all important occasions and engage fully. I wish all his family members happy birthday even if I have never wished my own family members. 

He and his family knows I have very little connection with my own family. I grew up in a very unaffectionate household and my attachment to my parents is only because of the fact that they gave birth to me really. He knows my birth mom abandoned me when I was a kid and so my attachment to families has always been distant. Even so I take his family like my own. I bring baked goods to his house every time, buy them gifts for all holidays. I do everything. I just feel like something as minor as not wishing his aunt happy Mother’s Day shouldn’t be held against me."
AmItheAsshole,fq5x6w9,t1_fq5wz16,1589119747.0,"I’m not close with my parents. I never said not wishing Mother’s Day is an American norm. I mentioned I’m not close with my family. They’re not very affectionate or emotional people. Never celebrated holidays other than birthdays I guess. 

I’m not heartless, my boyfriend is Muslim, I engage with all the holidays and traditions of his. I’m there at all family gatherings. I do everything that I consider to be important. I just don’t think it’s something to be offended at if your nephews foreign girlfriend who you last spoke to 8 mo this ago didn’t call you to wish you happy Mother’s Day.

Edit: also wanna add as an American, I know everyone celebrates Mother’s Day. But we would not be expected to call up and wish all the women in our extended family happy Mother’s Day or they would be offended."
mentalhealth,fq5e8cb,t1_fpu6mpr,1589102012.0,"Thank you so much! That’s more or less exactly how I’m approaching this. Being trained in CBT the only thing I’m helping him do is to question the irrationality of the thoughts he’s having. And also explaining to him how common anxiety is. It’s like catching a cold if we compare it to physical illnesses. What he is experiencing is not something to be so frightened by, he’s not losing his mind and it’s not gonna be like that forever. It’s hard cause like I said it’s his first experience with anxiety so it’s a bit frightening for him to feel his heart beat fast and his head pounding and having existential thoughts. So all I help him do is remind him how his thoughts are just the result of an anxious mind. I read to him articles written by people about their experiences with depersonalization and recovering from it and it helps him to understand better what he is experiencing. But thank you! I’ll keep in mind what you said it was very helpful :)"

No amount of painkiller would continue to help. I amazingly always just believed this is what PMS is. It wasn’t till college that I saw that while other girls might have cramps now and then, it’s not supposed to be debilitating. You’re also not supposed to have debilitating cramps in the days between your periods which are strong enough to turn your legs to jelly and need to sit on the ground to recoup."

Had a student of mine come up and describe how her brother is isolating, cutting off contact slowly, talking about aliens and government conspiracies and secret organizations he works with and he might be killed if he reveals which secret organization and I don’t know if it was denial but she asked me if this is normal. My reaction was literally, no sweetheart that is not normal. Unfortunately even though she was eventually understanding of how her brother needs not just professional help but immediate hospitalization to manage his delusions, her family didn’t catch on very fast. They’re still in denial. They know his behaviors are weird but still somehow convince themselves he’ll be fine."
AskReddit,fq38wm8,t3_gge8dn,1589064099.0,"A guy in my school was shot to death by a couple of dead-end-lives wannabe-gangsta kids. One of those good for nothing boys harassed his sister so he got pissed and went over to that boys place and had a scuffle. Couple of hours later, boy called up his wannabe gangsta friends and they did a drive-by as he was hanging out with a friend in some parking lot. Luckily there were many witnesses because considering those group of kids had connections with police enforcement (one of their dad being a cop in a high ranking position) it could have been all buried away. 

Anyway I didn’t know the guy super well myself as he was a couple of grades younger than me, it was still just a senseless death."
mentalhealth,fprocza,t1_fprnrgv,1588858807.0,"No I’m sorry if I gave that impression. He’s no where near depressed or suicidal. He’s normally perhaps the most enthusiast and cheerful person in the room. He has the most optimistic and excited view on life. I think of him like a golden retriever. He’s never experienced anxiety and so he’s having a hard time understanding what’s going on in his mind. 

He’s cheerful throughout the day, being himself and then at night his anxiety rises again. It’s not even a bad case of anxiety. As a therapist who has worked with anxiety patients and experienced intense anxiety myself, I know the difference. It’s just a different feeling for him. I just wanna help him through it and morning yoga and deep relaxation already seemed to help a bit."

mentalhealth,fpr3pwb,t3_gezvac,1588841279.0,"Hi there, I’m a psychologist and while I couldn’t diagnose you without a proper conversation about what you’re experiencing, I can make an educated guess that it’s just generalized anxiety and perhaps mild depressive symptoms. It is not normal if it effects your relationships, your productivity and functionality in life and causes you distress. So get yourself an appointment with a therapist and get help early.

AmItheAsshole,fpajhm4,t1_fpaj2y7,1588449453.0,"It’s a lot to do with his culture too. He comes from a Mediterranean culture and apart from his mother, being late and keeping people waiting is just the norm. Even though he understands consciously why it’s a big deal for me, I feel like it’s just such a long-learned behavior that he finds it hard to change. 

But a few months ago I promised him I’ll be totally transparent whenever something bothers me, which I didn’t used to do before, so I’m gonna stay angry for at least some time just to make it clear that this is an important issue for me."
AmItheAsshole,fpaj5od,t1_fpaiwob,1588449257.0,"I’ll do this from now because it seems like the most proactive way to deal with a habitually unpunctual person.

AmItheAsshole,fpai35p,t1_fpag5uh,1588448627.0,"This is what I’m attempting to do this time. I’m making it clear that I’m mad and this was not okay and I will stay mad for sometime because an apology will not simply do. This is just so he senses the importance of this issue and is conscious of not repeating it the next time. 

I made a promise to him a few months back to be very transparent in what bothers me and not be passive or hold it in so that’s what I’m doing now. 

He’s not really guilt tripping me as I’m not really one to be guilt tripped. Either way he’s a super caring and loving boyfriend in all other senses, but this lack of punctuality and consciousness about time is just so ingrained in his personality and the culture he grew up in that I feel like he just can’t see how it should bother someone that much. But he knows it’s gotta change."
AmItheAsshole,fpahn3h,t1_fpah797,1588448362.0,"I feel like it’s also a slight difference in our personalities/cultures. I’m a hyper-punctual person. I hate making people wait, it makes me deeply uncomfortable to know someone is waiting on me. I’m always early to things and apologize if my work takes longer than expected. 

On the other hand, he is from a Mediterranean culture and as per his personality is just a very unpunctual person. I half-joke that when he says 5 min, I already know in my head that means 15 min. 

But this is my attempt at being more open about my thoughts and anything that bothers me. And I will take up your idea of asking him to clearly define what he means by his times. I feel like that’s the best I can do with someone who’s not punctual by nature to make him more conscious about time."
AmItheAsshole,fpah7bi,t1_fpag5za,1588448102.0,"I’ve expressed that to him, how I feel like he doesn’t respect my time. He did apologize and told me he understands that what he did is dumb, but still makes no attempt to change it. He just acknowledges it which I don’t know what to do with unless he actually changes this behavior, and not the next time but this time. I’m not only to hold onto anger but I will show him I’m pissed for tonight just so he gets that this is an important thing."

It has been a communication issue I agree, but I’m making an effort lately to say what’s on my mind directly and not say “it’s fine” or “it’s okay” till I really feel like it is. This is obviously not a huge deal but i have a habit of convincing myself that I’m overreacting and I should chill out, which is why I posted, to know if I’m not reacting for no reason."
relationship_advice,fomv916,t3_g7vdi9,1587904916.0,"Bisexual people are just normal people who are sexually attracted to both sexes. Their need to have sex is no different from the average heterosexual person.

Would you be fine with it then? Would you consider that cheating? Would you consider texting another guy in sexual ways cheating?

I would tell him very sternly that he may have his personal opinions on the etiquettes of dressing and you have yours and you’ve both lived with those etiquettes your entire lives. Unless it’s something that’s outwardly inappropriate like he felt uncomfortable about how revealing your clothes were, it’s a non issue. You’re not flashing yourself to anyone and if he doesn’t trust you enough to think that just because you didn’t wear panties you’re being unfaithful then it’s just not a sturdy relationship foundation to begin with."
