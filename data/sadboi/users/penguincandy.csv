You are faced with either signing it because you don't want to be awkward; or refusing to sign it and damaging your relationship with the aide. 

Having a strong relationship with your regular aides and nurses is so important that if I had been presented with the checklist, I would have signed it either way.

Definitely for a few years, Brother's death caused my husband to question everything about faith. It was made worse because the church my husband tried right after the murder told him that Brother was definitely in hell because their mother never got them baptized as kids. He became strongly atheist for a while because he couldn't reconcile how God could allow his brother to be murdered or send his brother to hell on a technicality. Eventually - like 5 years later - he wanted the reassurance that Brother is in a joyful, peaceful place and found his way back to faith.

EatCheapAndHealthy,fr5ksle,t3_gmr4p1,1589910188.0,"Eggs and legumes (especially dried beans/lentils) are the easy answer. Both very cheap and can be prepared in lots of different ways. 

Tofu, especially if you can find it at an Asian market. The supermarket near my house prices mediocre tofu at $5/lb but the Asian market prices way better tofu at $2/lb.  Oh also look for tempeh, which is similar to tofu but it's fermented so it has probiotics and a pleasant nutty flavor. 

Edamame is an easy protein-filled plant snack. Buy it frozen, boil it up, drain, and sprinkle with coarse salt. Perfect every time. 

Seitan (vital wheat gluten) has ridiculous amounts of protein. It's cheaper to make than buy if you are at a supermarket or health food store, but often very cheap at the Asian market. When you see cans of ""mock duck"", that's usually seitan. It has a chewy meaty texture, very enjoyable. 

Turkey breast is often pretty reasonably priced and can be used any place you would use chicken. Ground turkey can be subbed in for ground beef... it depends on your area if this will be any cheaper. It runs about $7/lb in my neighborhood, but in another town 20 minutes away it's $2/lb regularly. 

Canned tuna generally is very affordable and can be transformed into a lot of different dishes.  

Depending on where you live, there may be cheap fresh fish options, too. I'm in the USA Midwest so seafood here is not very affordable due to the shipping costs, but when I visit the coast I am amazed how accessible fish and shellfish can be."

Nothing weird ever happened. Everyone was appropriate about wearing clothes in common areas. No one flirted with anyone. Everyone was super respectful. And everyone lived pretty quiet lives - just work and school, nothing crazy. It felt a more like a sibling/family situation - I thought of them like brothers and they thought of me like a sister, and those lines were never crossed. 

The year before when I lived with just women, the particular women in that house were more brash and had fewer boundaries. They didn't want a ""family"" situation, they wanted their house to be exciting and dramatic. They wouldn't put on clothes because ""we're all girls here"", they would party a lot on weekends, have tons of guests over at all times, and generally were rowdy and loud.

TrueChristian,fr4zwbr,t1_fr3lrev,1589899994.0,"The reason I changed my mind is that I believe God calls to us and makes promises to us that come long before any repentance. Baptism is the sign of the covenant, and children born into faithful homes are covenant children. 

The Bible speaks to children as believers already. Children are expected to behave as believers and engage with their Sunday school lessons as believers. Churches don't regard little kids as godless pagans in need of evangelizing, so withholding baptism seems like talking from both sides of the mouth. 

Children who are raised in faithful homes have effectively had the decision made for them anyway - a child raised in a Christian home is not converting to Christianity at age 8, they have been Christian all along - so waiting seems like just an ordinance. 

However, all that personal thought aside, most traditions have two rituals for kids anyway. There is something in infancy (baptism or dedication) and then something for older kids or tweens (confirmation or baptism). Either way, all young people in the church are promised to be raised faithfully in infancy, and go through an experience later where they can make their own decision about committing to God. With that in mind, infant baptism is not a hill I would die on if it was the one thing me and my spouse disagreed upon in an otherwise compatible relationship."
dementia,fr4x3s2,t3_gm71ib,1589898529.0,"My grandma came home for her final week on hospice and many home health aides came through. I think we had heightened awareness around sanitization that I wouldn't have noticed before. 

What we found behaviorwise that made me and my mom bite our tongues was that most of the aides refused to wear their masks appropriately. They would let their nose out (most common) or eventually discard it entirely saying that it doesn't really help in close contact anyway. They never asked permission for this. 

They would bring in backpacks and set them anywhere without sanitizing first. So now we know that same backpack has been set down in a dozen other homes today alone with no sanitation. 

They would pull equipment out of the bag, like stethoscopes, and use it without sanitizing. And then stuff it back into the backpack with no sanitizing and no outer container. Which really makes me me think it's never getting cleaned, and even if it was, it's still going back into a bag full of germs. 

Like I mentioned, I don't think I would have noticed anything like that pre-COVID. But during the pandemic, suddenly I was extremely aware that there was very little precaution taken."
TrueChristian,fr3g0fe,t3_gmedpv,1589856611.0,"I believe in infant baptism, but I grew up with in a anabaptist tradition where children could choose to be baptized at age 8 or later, so I understand the thinking. The theory being that baptism is about repenting and dedicating yourself to God, and that should be a choice you get to make (and one babies cannot make).  

I'm not sure about your gf's church, but most anabaptist traditions still have an infant christening to bless the baby and have the parents announce their intention to raise a Christian family. If your desire for an infant baptism is primarily about ""a sign, symbol and seal of God's promises"" as your post mentions, then a christening may fulfill that need."

Luke, Acts, Genesis, Exodus, Matthew 

Luke and Acts are by the same author, and explore Jesus' life and the early church. Genesis and Exodus are Old Testament and give you a foundation in the Hebrew Bible. Then the gospel of Matthew is the gospel by a Jewish writer so it will make a lot more sense after Genesis and Exodus.

Probably not. Even if she really did feel it in her heart, it wouldn't be worth anything if she never tried to show you. Your friends would beg you to dump her because her caring doesn't mean anything. It would be dead love.

Same with works of faith. If we really have faith and hope and love for God, we would pray, and go to church, and nurse the sick, and feed the hungry, and clothe the naked, and protect the oppressed.

New Oxford is a seminary textbook so it's very academic and sometimes takes a strong tone. It's very detailed, focused a lot on symbolism, and has given me a lot of information I've never read anywhere else. 

Harper Collins focuses more on the historical context and different meanings of the words. It feels more accessible because it offers more concrete information and makes it easy to apply the scripture. It also features essays and commentary from many different viewpoints across the theological spectrum so it feels very balanced.

* Judith

And virtually everyone is warned to use condoms if they don't want pregnancy, but people hate the feeling so they take the risk anyway. Warnings of future potential consequences don't feel real to most people, especially faced with the prospect of losing out on pleasures today. 

Jesus did warn about hell but he focused much more on rescuing people from oppression. Many more words dedicated to protecting people than to future punishment. He helped the poor, healed the sick, cared for the outcasts, loved everybody, and forgave without being asked for forgiveness.

Stupid fees and penalties assessed for the most petty things, like if you set the recycling bin outside the night before collection instead of morning-of. Noisy neighbors. Pot-smoking neighbors giving the whole building a skunky smell. Crowded parking lots, getting dinged up car doors. Having to keep doors locked at all times because people would just wander in if not.

However I would encourage you not to use pornography. You're still really young and porn can give you some odd and wrong ideas about how sex should look in a healthy relationship.

TrueChristian,fqu99g0,t1_fqselo1,1589654505.0,"Yeah, it's a difficult situation. There is an element of being performative in order to get help, especially from churches and faith-based nonprofits - you have to be able to demonstrate being deserving of help, which is a horrible thing to ask of people. Jesus never asked anybody to prove they needed healing. 

There are soup kitchens and shelters but they are limited in physical capacity and often have other rules that can be prohibitive - such as being sober, or professing faith in their particular brand of religion. (This is especially problematic for LGBT people, who are more likely to be homeless than other demographics, because these pray-for-your-supper places are often anti-LGBT.) One soup kitchen in my city also insists that folks take out piercings and cover up tattoos before entering, but doesn't provide sanitary conditions or materials to do so. 

If you want to help, consider looking for the grassroots group Free Hot Soup in your area. It's a national movement that gives unhoused people food and supplies, no strings attached. There is one in my city and they have literally saved lives. 

Also, places called ""catholic worker's homes"" (little 'c' catholic not Catholic) are often very welcoming to all people regardless of sobriety or faith, feed anyone who shows up, and asks anyone who is willing to help with chores after dinner. Most homeless people do want to work and do want to feel useful so the result is feeling fed both physically and emotionally."
TrueChristian,fqsbe4d,t3_gkfici,1589602877.0,"Growing up, my family was homeless three times before I got to high school. I know what it's like to have nothing and rely on the kindness of strangers. And I know what it's like to have parents who are the perfect image of ""people who don't deserve help"" (substance abuse issues, reckless decision making, sour attitude), but strangers helping anyway, and how grateful I was for that. 

I carry care packages in my car that have food, water and hygiene products. For the food, remember to include some soft foods (a lot of homeless people have dental issues that can make vigorous chewing painful, such as you would need with nut bars or jerky) and protein foods (such as the shelf-stable chicken salad kits with crackers). For hygiene products, some toothpaste and deodorant helps a lot, as well as hotel-size shampoo/conditioner if you can get it. During winter, some hand warmers are a good comfort. I also keep a few boxes of menstrual pads in the car for women panhandlers, as there is not much worse than having a period with no supplies. (Also: put everything in a gallon ziploc, as having a seal-able waterproof bag is so helpful when you have to carry everything you own) I've given hundreds of these bags away and only one single time did a panhandler refuse it and ask for money instead. 

I'm also not opposed to giving cash when I have it. It's not my business what they do with it. A lot of people feel scandalized at the idea that the homeless person might buy alcohol. Honestly if I was homeless as an adult, I would too. A couple dollars will not end homelessness, but a little vodka can keep you calm enough to sleep for a night... hard to begrudge a human comfort to someone who literally has none."
TrueChristian,fqsairz,t1_fqqv7di,1589602265.0,"Almost all food pantries require a photo ID and some kind of proof of need, such as income proof.

A lot of them require you to make an appointment, so you have to have access to a phone and then be able to get there on time. 

Homeless people often do not have all of those resources. Even if they can manage all of that, food pantries have limits on how often you can visit, and the food they provide is composed of ingredients. Particularly ones supported by USDA grants have to meet nutritional guidelines to retain funding so are giving raw produce and raw meat that isn't suitable to eat without cooking and requires refrigeration until it's prepared. 

Food pantries are a great resource for people with homes who need help making ends meet. They are not a good solution for homeless people. It's not very empathetic to suggest."

As a child of divorce, with both parents staying negative about the other the entire time, I get that it sucks. But the kids are aware these are lies and are reporting them back to OP so clearly any alienation effort is not effective. It's just going to make the mom look worse to them. There are things OP could do to strengthen his parent-child relationships, but staying focused on the ex-wife's world is not one of them. 

> While she may ""have that right"" according to the world, as a professing Christian she does not have the right

I mean, sure, but as an ex-husband OP has exactly zero standing on this. That's between exwife and God. When OP divorced her, he abandoned any right to have spiritual leadership.

Whoever you might pick to discuss marriage issues - siblings or close friends - is going to be biased towards you and perhaps unintentionally egg you on into selfish actions. If I talk to my sister about my husband, she is going to take my side 100% of the time. And I will take her side in her issues 100% of the time, too. I like to think we can be unbiased but we can't, really.

Reformed,fqnwwky,t3_gjx1zl,1589503012.0,"What kind of resolution are you really looking for? 

If it's to be welcomed back, that sounds not possible. Your post is kinda vague but it sounds like you did something in your marriage that they felt was against their beliefs, and then divorced which is against their beliefs, and then remarried which is against their beliefs. It would be very difficult to resume a positive community atmosphere with someone who continually makes major life decisions violating the community's shared ethical code.

If it's to feel justified that they are in the wrong... I'm not sure it can be justified. PCA communities are pretty clear about what conduct they expect from members, and tend to be pretty clear that shunning an unrepentant sinner is the correct action. Forgiveness and un-shunning is for people who stop doing the sinful thing. Being married to a second wife is pretty clearly fitting in that ""unrepentant sinner"" mold, apologetic letter or not. As far as PCA community rules go, they are not in the wrong and are actually upholding what they believe to be true. 

Outside of PCA and in the broader world? Some people just aren't going to like you and it's not worth grinding towards trying to make them like you. The only recourse you really have is to stay above it all and act friendly and warm. Personally I would be very offput by receiving a letter in the mail defending their side from old gossip. Especially because the community rallied around the exwife, getting a letter/email like that (years later!!) would feel like a power play attempting to reduce ex's support base. Any action like that is the opposite of the friendly demeanor that will let people be warm to you in the grocery store. 

Honestly it sounds like you have way too much headspace dedicated to the exwife and her friends. You have a new wife, new community, new friends... if the ex wants to live her life being angry about the divorce, that's her right. You don't have to make it your problem too. I bet your new wife would appreciate more attention on her, and less on the ex, too."
GayChristians,fqnulhx,t1_fqno7g2,1589501701.0,"Jesus was pretty clear about tax collectors! He told them not to swindle people. 

Luke 3:12-14 *Some tax collectors came to be baptized.

The passage Luke 19:2-8 also has tax collectors repenting. 

Jesus spoke against many sins including:

* Murder and Holding grudges (Matt 5:27, Matt 19:18, Luke 23:34, Mark 10:19)
* Adultery (Matt 5:28, Matt 19:18, Mark 10:19)
* Unethical divorce (Matt 5:31, Matt 19:8, Mark 10:11)

* Greed (Matt 6:19, Matt 21:13, Luke 6:24, Luke 12:21, Luke 16:13, John 2:16)
* Being judgmental (Matt 7:1, Luke 6:37, Luke 37-38)
* Charging money for what God gave you freely (Matt 10:8)
* Hypocrisy (Matt 15:7, Matt 18:35, Matt 23, Mark 4:24, Mark 7:6, Luke 6:41)
* Blaming others for your own sins (Matt 18:9)

* Blasphemy and Being ashamed of Jesus (Mark 3:29, Mark 7:22, Mark 8:38, Luke 9:26, Luke 12:9)
* Putting God to the test (Luke 4:12)

Lots of bad actions! The common thread is all of these things affect your relationships with God and/or other people. If you break promises or abandon your spouse or hold grudges... other people are negatively affected.

AskAChristian,fqn9jnx,t3_gjog95,1589490971.0,"I wouldn't see the point of being a Christian without belief in Jesus. The point of Christianity isn't just that Jesus had some neato-burrito things to say. If that's all it was, you could choose from hundreds of wise philosophers throughout history. Plus, a lot of what Jesus said was specifically about his divinity -- so if you think he didn't exist and/or wasn't divine, that would make him a lunatic at best, hardly worth listening to about other matters. 

Additionally, it would require rejection of history. There are secular writings about Jesus as well, not just the gospels. We have more confirmation from more sources about Jesus existing than we have about Cleopatra who lived just a couple decades earlier. To reject the idea of a historical Jesus of Nazareth is to severely question the existence of Cleopatra, Julius Caesar, and other ancient historical figures who have fewer sources and far less diversity of sources attesting to their life."
GayChristians,fqmxgp3,t3_gjrv9n,1589485158.0,"Interestingly any verses referring to ""homosexual"" acts (in quotes because that would be a modern interpretation, and the word homosexual wasn't in the Bible until the 1940s) refer to men. The Bible is silent on women with women. Women's sexuality in general was rarely mentioned outside of Song of Solomon. During the time period of the Mosaic laws, women were legally considered property, and their consent was irrelevant. Sex was something done \*to\* women, not \*with\* women. Even in Romans 1, and even in the conservative translations like NIV, women-with-women was not cited as a concern. So even if you were doing a literal reading (which I would never advocate), you could loophole out as being a woman. 

There is also support for the idea of Jesus affirming queer people. For example, in the story of the Centurion asking for healing for his ""servant"" (Matthew 8:5-13 and Luke 7:1-10) the word used by the soldier is ""Pais"". *Pais* only means servant the way ""helpmeet"" in Genesis means ""wife""... that to say, secular writings of the same era, such as Thucydides and Plutarch, used *Pais* to refer to a same-gender lover. And it was just as much a taboo then to have a *Pais* as in modern conservative circles; it would be viewed with the same disdain as asking for the healing of your favorite prostitute. But Jesus did not reject the Centurion, and did not pass any recorded judgement about the arrangement. He offered love and healing only. 

Unfortunately some churches take a hard literal line on this issue without regard for the original cultures and contexts of the words. You may look for queer theology writings for some progressive views."

She knew who ""my name"" was but couldn't connect it with my face because to her memory ""my name"" was still a child.

It always frustrated my mom that my mom and I were the caretakers visiting constantly, and taking her to lunch and doctor appts, yet she forgot us first, and remembered everyone else months longer. 

Comfortingly, at her final rally 5 days before she died, she seemed to remember everyone.

Sadly my dad never really thought of them as truly family and didn't extend any brotherly love. He also developed some sour opinions about adoption in general.

But having a name for the temptation to be selfish -- even Jesus said ""Get behind me, Satan"" to a friend who suggested he walk away, who was clearly not literally Satan -- defines for humanity the abusive relationship we have with sin. It's not until we are outside of it that we can look back and say, ""whoa, that was clearly unhealthy, I'm glad I'm out."""
AskAChristian,fq9v8xp,t3_ghnw6u,1589207726.0,"When it comes to unreached peoples, we often go to ""tribes without outside communication"" as the default. But an unreached person could also be a baby or small child who died, or a person with severe disability who never could comprehend religion. In those latter cases, pretty much all denominations agree that a person who died without any ability to comprehend Christianity would still be welcomed home by God. 

There is no inherent difference between ""someone who died too young to know"" and ""someone who died without ability to know"". We can't choose where we are born, or the circumstances of the country we are raised in, and we can't know what we can't know. Someone who grew up in a super rural area with no outside information or someone who lives under a fascist regime without access to Christianity has done nothing wrong in not having access, it's just random circumstance. 

God isn't dumb. God doesn't make rules that have to be unjustly enforced. God is loving and merciful. 

With all the descriptions the Bible gives us about God - loving, kind, merciful, forgiving, fair and just - you are meant to internalize those and measure them against what people might say God is. 

So when you come across an idea and have that stomach-twisting thought of ""I can't serve that god because that god is unjustly punishing the innocent"" that is a major clue that the idea must be flawed, because it doesn't match what we know about the nature of God."
Christian,fq7stp3,t3_gh9ykd,1589151492.0,"Wow, I could have written this myself! I'm often the odd duck out despite trying very hard to fit in with normal girls. 

I mean this in the politest possible way but have you considered getting assessed for the autism spectrum? It took me a longggg time before anyone medically recognized that I'm on the spectrum. It presents very differently in women than in men, and one of the telltale social signs is that other girls reject you and you can't figure out why. 

Your attention to detail on finding patterns in their actions (such as ""not liking my comments but liking others"") is very similar to my own analysis process which made me think of it. 

Either way, praying that you are able to find friendship companions and ease the lonely feelings."

It's more expected of course in Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, South Carolina... places where the ""rebel"" flag is still flown regularly. But it's also happened in Wisconsin, Ohio, Kansas, Washington state, Colorado, places that you would think would be more open-minded. 

My family members who reacted badly are from California, and his are from Oregon. 

So really the whole country is like this."

OpenChristian,fpsj64s,t3_gfa0nh,1588874357.0,"I can relate. My mom is super into conspiracy theories and Plandemic and anti-vaxx, the whole thing. The last time she took me to the doctor was when I was 4, and the doctor tried to talk to her about the obvious symptoms of a heart condition I was showing. She got mad and never took me back because ""there is nothing wrong with my baby"". (I'm 29 now and diagnosed, so don't yall worry.)

She says she is anti-medicine and anti-Big Pharma but she didn't even hesitate to go through treatment when she had cancer; and again didn't hesitate to get weight loss surgery and take a ton of prescription diet pills to get skinnier. She takes Prozac, illegally buys and abuses Valium, smokes medical-grade weed every day, and she's had some cosmetic procedures. To be clear I'm glad she got her cancer treated and is getting her depression treated, I just wish she didn't hold the idea of ""medicine is bad except when I personally want it""."
FirstTimeHomeBuyer,fpshr71,t3_gf90p6,1588873684.0,"I also grew up in a really unstable family and have a lot of anxieties about expenses. Ultimately I did choose a traditional house. 

When it comes to neighborhoods, many mobile home communities and manufactured home communities are pretty similar to other neighborhoods. You can find these communities in better and worse school districts, with better and worse crime rates, and so on. 

My main concern is if you'll be owning the land your home sits on. If it's truly mobile and you can move that's one thing; but even ""trailer homes"" often are not actually movable. If you have to lease the lot and answer to a landlord, but you have no additional resources to keep that home livable, and you can still get evicted, that takes away a lot of the allure of owning property. (Especially after I read *Evicted* by Matthew Desmond, where he goes undercover in a lot manager's office that screws people out of their owned trailers... it's brutal.) 

Secondly I would look at the utility bills. A lot of manufactured homes have little to no insulation which can make a big difference if you live anywhere that needs AC/heating. My mother-in-law lives in a single-wide 1-bedroom trailer home and her electric bill is about $300 per month. My grandma lived in a manufactured home (on a foundation) and had the same issue of super high utility bills, $300-400 per month just for electric. 

Once you account for lot fees and higher utility bills, it may not be that much cheaper to choose a mobile or manufactured home. 

Especially if you plan to stay in it for the long term -- with a traditional home, after your mortgage is done, the bulk of your monthly expenses goes away. This is part of my financial retirement planning; by the time I'm ready to retire, I won't have a mortgage payment anymore which will reduce my monthly expenses significantly. However my MIL paid off her trailer but still has lot fees and high utility bills as long as she stays in the home."
ProjectHospital,fpsee7r,t1_fps4i60,1588872064.0,"Observation is used for complicated ER cases. The purpose is to keep the clinic doctors focused on fast cases to move through the patient queue, while the Observation doctors can focus on the non-obvious cases. 

If your clinic doctors can't figure out the program from the interview and maybe one examination, send the patient to Observation. People in Observation don't get restless and leave from waiting too long. But if your clinic doctors are spending too much time on one patient, the rest in the waiting room will get angry and start leaving, which will hurt your incoming numbers the next day."
Christian,fpscdcj,t3_geyehx,1588871091.0,"I have a Bible that I intensively highlight.

I also have an interleaved journaling Bible that I use. I make a lot of notes from various study materials (I own several study Bibles, the Holman Illustrated Bible Guide, and other resources depending on the study) as well as my own notes that speak to application in my life. Plus sometimes I'll make little drawings that aid me in remembering. Basically the goal is to create my own super-personal study Bible. 

Also, the Bible Project videos and podcasts are super helpful in understanding the stories and themes."

Christianity,fps2t12,t3_gf6q97,1588866517.0,"Surprised to see so many people in this thread who have never heard anyone say that. 

My marriage is interracial and there were relatives who refused to come to the wedding because of that. And that was in 2016 - not some long ago decade. These were people who had never expressed any racist feelings around us until they got the wedding invitation and suddenly there was a lot of ""unequally yoked"" talk, and a lot of Old Testament paraphrase-quotes about not intermarrying with ""foreigners and enemies"". That was from both of our extended families.

Even since then, upon finding out that my husband and I are different colors, people react strongly. I took his last name, and it's obviously a different ethnic background than me. So people often ask - how did you get a name like that? And I tell the truth - I'm married, it's my husband's family name. I would say about 25% of the time, I'm met back with a racist comment about people of his race, or a judgement about interracial marriage often with a religious tinge. 

It's unfortunately still a large issue."
EatCheapAndHealthy,fprxi17,t3_gespkp,1588863896.0,"There are really only two solutions to reducing food waste: 1, buy less to begin with; 2, save more of what you bought.  

There are lots of good ideas in this thread about planning ahead, sticking to a list, purchasing nonperishables, and preserving foods. I would also suggest considering doing online shopping for your groceries. It eliminates having to go to the store, and it's much harder to impulse-buy extra stuff when you have to search for each item you want. If you select curbside pickup, most stores don't have any additional fees, so it's a win-win."
ProjectHospital,fprv8c5,t3_gf7g8g,1588862687.0,"So there is a tension in the game between money and care. There is a certain amount of churning out patients in order to turn a profit. 

Finding hidden symptoms depends on the certainty level of the department. If  you set certainty to High, then the doctors will continue testing until every symptom is discovered. However, this will clog up your hospital (slower wait times for all patients, lowering star ratings) and won't result in any additional revenue from that patient. 

You only have to treat the actual disease. So for the tapeworm, the antihelmintics would do the job and send the patient on their way. Adding the painkillers may increase the patient's star rating of the hospital. However, dietary modification will keep someone in the ER longer for no apparent gain - no additional funds, no additional satisfaction, hogging an observation bed that someone else could be using. 

In the ER mode, sometimes the grey eye will still be flashing when you've got a diagnosis and performed treatment. If the green house icon lights up, you can discharge them anyway."
