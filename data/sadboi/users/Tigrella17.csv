I‚Äôve treated people of all genders, weights, races, and socioeconomic statuses. Eating disorders are about behaviors, not about weight. 

You could be doing irreparable damage to your heart, bones, and other organ systems through what you describe here. These behaviors are extremely concerning and you need to reach out for help from a doctor/therapist ASAP."
EatingDisorders,finap66,t3_f8pg16,1582559590.0,"Honestly? I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any way for the current dynamics of your relationship to be healthy. In general, it could be possible have two folks in a healthy relationship while both struggling with EDs. However, that looks very different from your current relationship. 

If both people are committed to working on recovery and putting that first in their lives, it could be a supportive environment in which both people could thrive. In yours, it seems that you‚Äôre both very competitive with each other, and any sort of attempt at accountability will only breed more comparison and secretiveness.

I think you need to take a long, hard look at what this relationship is doing for you. Is it allowing you to be supported and work on your own shit? Or is it allowing you to brush it under the rug and avoid it because of the fear of losing or triggering your partner? The answer seems clear, but something to think on. 

You‚Äôre both actively hurting each other, even if that‚Äôs not your intention. Individual therapy and treatment is key here."

That‚Äôs 100% up to you. Just know that it‚Äôs not just your comfort on the line, it‚Äôs your life, and the lives of everyone who care about you. 6 months is not going to cure your body image issues, but it might prevent you from being able to have children, damage your organs, or burn relationships with people you love. Consider all you have to lose against you think you‚Äôre gaining. Maybe it‚Äôs worth it to you, but that sound like a pretty sad way to live.

I did want to comment just to say: if you had an ED in the past, you need to be incredibly careful with losing weight. Please talk to a registered dietician about setting up a meal plan with you/have them monitor your exercise. Remember, there is no fast way to lose weight that is safe/permanent. Large amounts of weight loss over a shirt period of time leads to gaining it all back (and maybe then some). There is no quick fix.

Are you able to talk to your/her parents about this? A school counselor? Regardless of her weight right now, her mentality is very concerning and requires some deep therapy. I was in a similar situation in high school where I had to make some boundaries with a friend of mine with an ED. While mental illness explains a person‚Äôs behavior, it doesn‚Äôt excuse them treating you badly and damaging your own mental health. Also, from another perspective, you‚Äôre enabling her behavior by giving her an outlet to share these things. That‚Äôs no one‚Äôs fault, it‚Äôs just the situation. Let her know unequivocally that you will not tolerate thinspo photos or her own negative self talk (having a hard day is different than saying things like, I‚Äôm not going to eat today, I‚Äôm going to lose 20 pounds etc.). If she wants to talk in a productive way, that‚Äôs fine. But it doesn‚Äôt seem like she‚Äôs ready to do that.

EatingDisorders,f6wirdy,t3_dtdvzp,1573227540.0,"So, first off, please find a therapist who specializes in EDs. Purging is incredibly dangerous and can cause long term health issues. It sounds like you are very caught up in diet culture and stuck in labeling foods as good and bad/healthy and unhealthy, etc. This is what is causing the anxiety and your compensatory behaviors. Something to focus on is an ‚Äúall foods fit‚Äù frame of mind. When you start to let go of these labels, you‚Äôre able to work on eating intuitively and lessening compensatory exercise and purging. This is hard to do on your own, again, please find a therapist. In the meantime, look up concepts like ‚Äúhealth at every size.‚Äù You deserve to be able to live without fear of food, because food isn‚Äôt scary!

EatingDisorders,f6wi5a3,t3_dtdwpc,1573227133.0,"Therapy is always the right answer. However, in the meantime, I would try to have an honest conversation with her. Say that you‚Äôre worried about this behavior, and remind her that this is often how full blown eating disorders begin. Depending on her reaction to your concern, that might give you a better idea of how fused she is with the behavior. For instance, if she takes it well and says she‚Äôll take it under consideration (that‚Äôs good) vs. says in no way does she have a problem and she‚Äôs going to keep doing it (more of a concern, harder push towards needing therapy)."
EatingDisorders,f6wfpq8,t3_dtdus2,1573225464.0,"Totally agree that you need to see an ED therapist and dietician. To your question: the binging is your body in survival mode trying to compensate for your periods of restriction. It is incredibly hard to get out of this cycle, because the ONLY way to break it is to eat meals and snacks at regular intervals. Your body is in a place where it doesn‚Äôt trust you to nourish it regularly, so it maintains the binge/restrict cycle. Part of recovering from this type of ED is reteaching your body how to eat intuitively. I hope that you‚Äôre able to find support for this through mental health professionals. Recovery is possible."

If you‚Äôre attempting to look more traditionally masculine, focusing on weight lifting.
