At large is also running! They’re like interest groups. So chose from them what you’re most interested in seeing changed at BU/ what you think is most important!

Anxiety,fmd7lne,t3_fuc1os,1585961128.0,"Yea I relate...it’s like being on a yo-yo. I lash out to because I need the reassurance and to hear them actually respond rather than just an imaginary voice in my own head. But I can’t imagine how hard it is on the other side because an hour later when I’m out of it I feel absolutely terrible. 

I wish I had people who understood that better and could talk me through it and support me but I’ve just found I’ve overwhelmed people. I lost someone I really loved because of it. I’m just too much. It doesn’t help that all my emotions I feel so passionately and strongly they’re like fire. So I try to save them for my therapist and avoid conversations that burden my relationships because I feel like I have and will only damage them..."
prozac,fma0d3h,t3_ftzdye,1585880732.0,Okay so I’m a 19 5’3 girl so I’m not gonna even try to compare drinking capabilities but I will say it’s like each drink is about 2x to 2.5x as strong. As a 19 year old in a pandemic it’s wonderful lol because my parents give me a glass of wine and it feels like I’ve had multiple also very cost efficient but be careful at parties or bars... it’ll take a bit to hit but if you drink like normal trust me it’ll hit like a truck.

Anxiety,flyqv8t,t3_frslfn,1585607314.0,Sigh every single comment in this thread is me. I was honestly wondering if I was depressed but seeing how many anxiety people it resonates with I guess it’s just another part of this stupid thing. It’s irrational and I know my friends love and care about me but I always feel like I’m on the outside of everything. I need constant reassurance....that didn’t work out too well with my ex and I’m constantly afraid it’s too much for my friends. I never ask for it I’m just always searching for it.
sex,flkhk40,t3_fp8b52,1585241054.0,No I was 100% the same way. I have an IUD so when I was in a committed relationship we went without them...it’s going to be very sad going back
AskWomen,flhf2md,t3_fosxav,1585161447.0,Yea I think it’s all about delivery but also realizing if it’s a lot for you don’t just keep dumping it on your partner sometimes a real therapist would be better. I have very strong and vivid emotions both good and bad also anxiety. While part of it was on my ex partner for not letting me know when it was too much for him and he needed space it was also on me for relying too much on him to vent those emotions. I believe that’s what ultimately cost me a wonderful relationship and an important skill we all need to learn.

heartbreak,flb2hql,t1_fl82x9c,1584996040.0,Thank you for taking the time to write so much! I started the process to distance myself from him. I can’t fully because we have a lot of friend group chats together but I’m a very open person emotionally and today I realized having one on one contact with him was only hurting me and as a result him more. Perhaps one day we can be friends but now is not that time for me. I have a future to chase after! :)

dating_advice,flb0qrj,t3_fneihh,1584995003.0,This was so needed. My ex broke up with me a few weeks ago and I’m been drowning myself in grief. I know I have my problems but at the same time this reminds me that if he truly wanted me. If he truly loved me he would’ve stuck with me through it as I always did with him. I loved that man with all my heart but it’s obvious now that he didn’t and I deserve to receive the same love I give to others and nothing less. We all do. Even my ex does as much as it’ll kill me to see him with someone else. Thank you for the reminder!
TwoXChromosomes,fl5qem3,t3_fmldc5,1584843066.0,I feel it now more than ever. My ex-boyfriend and I broke up at the beginning of February. I was just starting to get through the morning process and try to do new things when we were kicked off campus.

BreakUp,fio4klh,t1_fimfth1,1582576167.0,Thank you. It’s still fairly fresh for me. But my ex and I share many of the same activities and friends so it was a stage that had to be a priority for us but also was entirely dependent on our processing. I am someone who takes goes through all my emotions at once. I don’t and probably don’t know how in many ways to suppress anything but I also work through things quickly. He had time before deciding this is what he needed so he had a head start. I highly suggest writing out of all the bullshit I read online that’s what helped me the most. Getting my emotions out on paper. All of this is so uniquely individual. And once you get off the internet and out of your head you’ll find your path as cheesy as that sounds
BostonU,fi5cwt1,t3_f6g32c,1582160249.0,"That sounds absolutely ridiculous. I am so sorry you are going through this. Please fight this as far as you can, you do not deserve that F. I had Mono last semester and was out of school for 2 weeks around midterms so not nearly as bad as your case but I do understand BU and illness can be a mess. I second the other comment that says contact your Dean. Sometimes Professors can get easily frustrated with us and it’s stupid but that’s exactly why we have Deans. Best of luck!"

Yes, 3 hub unit classes exist they’re harder to find and are more in the way of the liberal arts side but they help a lot."

BostonU,f7la9n7,t3_dwrz59,1573836131.0,"And we noticed didn’t we? They have a political message that they feel is very critical for the student body to see and this was a very effective way to share it despite it’s legality. Good on them.

Edit: Guys I understand it’s no way near the best way and I would have definitely preferred a legal option that did not cause damage as it looks bad on the message but with no doubt limited means it was effective in causing a conversation. The number of students who had no idea what was going on and have been talking about HK today has been crazy"
AskWomen,f46mkkq,t3_djilw2,1571410766.0,"My partner and his entire family love baseball and I was clueless. I had to ask so many questions.. there’s a lot more strategy and complexity then you’d imagine from a bunch of grown men hitting balls with sticks and running in a circle for hours on end. But he never got even the tiniest bit frustrated when explaining it to me. Instead, I could tell he love doing it. Just sharing it with me had him smiling ear to ear and bouncing up and down like a child. It’s how he’s always been when he’s sharing something he’s passionate about with me. Last time the only thing I could respond with was, “ you’re so cute” not in a patronizing way but just a state of ah."

I’ve always been someone who’s very open about my self and thoughts but not getting the same in return can be disheartening. Finding my partner has been a game changer, he’s always open with his life too and views both of our struggles as a team effort. I never feel like I’m alone. Also, I’m someone with anxiety who has a tendency to irrationally overthink things. Sometimes I don’t know how to talk about it and just try to shut him out and wallow in it but he’s always there noticing when it happens and helps me through it...not exactly not pushy but supporting me in finding my words and helping me out of the hole."

dating_advice,ev6uu5j,t3_cid1ef,1564251675.0,"Girl do I feel. I’m a very romantic person...a very sexual person. So going to college with absolutely no experience in relationships was like being trapped in my own body. But even moving from my small town to a big city I just wasn’t connecting with anyone I met. So I tried Tinder....Bumble...Other random ones. They became mindless things I did when I was bored. 

There were a few dates that just fell flat and then one bad nut. We were “seeing each other” for a couple months and gees did I learn what I did not like in a man. I learned all the red flags and I engrained them. You really don’t want to go through a bad whatever that was and yea it sucked but I can not argue enough for EXPERIENCE. Seriously no book or redditor or friend will truly be able to prepare you the way an asshole, jerk, or idiot can. 

After sulking for a bit and swiping through Tinder, bored, one February day, I swiped right on my current boyfriend. An absolute sweetheart of a man. He started the conversation with asking about my life aspirations as were the same major and many months later I’m at the airport on my way to join him and his family on a beach vacation! You got this OP!"
