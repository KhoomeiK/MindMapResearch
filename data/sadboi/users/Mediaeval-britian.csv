1. stand your ground with boundaries. if you're not comfortable talking about your experience, do. not. do it. 
2. people can suck, but instinct is good. i'm not dating reject someone at the first hint of a red flag, but be carful and look out for yourself.
3. people aren't going to look at what happened and make a judgement call about friendship. and if they do, they're not worthy to be your friend anyway. the decent ppl in the world (and there in fact, are many) will see you for who you are and accept you.
4. if anything triggers you, acknowledge that, and make a plan. something to do if you come across that thing. a distraction, a place to go, something. 
5. you're a wonderful, kind, thoughtful, intellegent, fantastic, attractive, brave as hell human being. and anyone would be lucky to have you as a friend.

mentalhealth,fliyt1r,t3_fp42yu,1585194119.0,"holy. fuckin shit. your story. is so close to mine. PLEASE. message me. reading this is unreal to me. I'm a 17 year old girl in America, grown up with a christian family, christian friends, etc. i was never physically abused by anyone but my brother. but the scars i have, both mental and physical, are proof of what i've been through because of the church. i'm bisexual. it took me years to come to that realization and except it for what it is, instead of burying it inside like o wanted to. when i figured it out i was already very much questioning my faith (i was 15ish) but the fact that i liked women was such a startling realization to me. just typing this brings up so many memories, and i'd never have time to type them. i'll start from the beginning and hopefully keep this short. i was always raised around christians except at school. i go to public school, but they were all pretty tolerant so we got along well. i always went to church, and youth group when i was old enough. i was baptized when i was 8. i go to an evangelical church, which is in the orthodox branch, so they don't make you get baptized at birth. but i was still 8. i was told that god loved children, and so many other things. you understand. so. i was gods little perfect helper. between my parents and their friend my ""aunt"" sue, i was taught not to sin, etc. my church isn't as strict as yours, but there are so many unspoken rules. i'm also a people pleaser and part of the reason why is the church. i joined youth group when i was in 6th grade. 12ish. i made friends, had crushes, fit in enough to have fun. i went every week and did everything i could to go. we played dodgeball, capture the flag, etc. it was crazy fun. and yeah there were lessons but it was all for god. but after a while i spent more time looking at boys than paying attention. i'm in a semi-rural part of the north, so i'm one of like, theee black people outside my family at my church. so i already stuck out like a sore thumb. but when i started to stare at girls too...
then i suddenly had friends who were gay and trans. i know it was a sin, but i loved them. so very very much. so i accepted it. one of my friends always told me that i seemed way more interested in anything queer than a straight person ever would be. when i went on to high school i stopped going to youth group. it was so much more god centered, but they still treated us like kids, and it all felt too new and raw. my younger brother (who is the golden child) never went, so i got out of it pretty easy. but the summer after freshman year i was at a national competition with my parents and a few friends, far from home and cooped up in an airbnb. and then one night I went swimming with my friends. and suddenly i wanted to hold hands with a girl in a tight bathing suit. that night while my parents fought (a regular occourence) i cried because i was gay. i was a sinner. i was going to hell. i was away from home for a week. i went to therapy for a while, and after we got back, my therapist told me that my parents had been trying to find out what we were talking about. i confronted them and they decided i wasn't to see her anymore. and i came out. idk why lol. i just wanted to. 
i'm seeing a new therapist now, and have distanced myself from the church in every way I can. my brother keeps trying to talk to me about god, and a while back when i had a girlfriend he kept reminding me that i was going to hell. i hate going to church because it's just a living reminder that so much of the world hates me because of who i love. all of my youth group memories, probably some life saving ones, are shrouded in the knowledge that they'd shun me if i went back. so now i'm here. i'm 100% the black sheep of the family. my grandparents on my mothers side support me through anything, and they're not religious so they're amazing. my parents split up, and my dad is awful and keeps telling me that my mom is bad, etc. it's so exhausting. but i'm a queer, i perform at drag shows, and write queer fantasy fiction. i have pride flags up in my room. my mom has no idea what to make of it (although she's the person who told me i had no reason to cut myself because i have a great life, so it's been rocky for a while) my dad is somewhat supportive but only so he can say he's supportive. my brother is preaching to me all the time. and my aunt things i like women because my mom and dad had a terrible relationship and i decided that a man couldn't give me a good relationship bc of how bad he was. so yeah. please message me bc it sounds like we have a whole lot in common and i want to help you get through this any way i can. i actually came to post on here about feeling shitty but just ranting abt all this has helped me feel better. so thanks lol. but yeah. pls message me bc i don't want u to suffer alone!"

They're not overly homophobic, but they're by no means supportive, and my brother has always preached at me. I was in the school library with my friends and i saw a book with a cool cover, so naturally I checked it out. It was called the dangerous art of blending in, and I read it twice in one night. The book helped me not only find myself, but begin to make peace with my stark contrast to my family, and the fact that they just chose not to understand and that i have to be my own person. It gave a massive boost to my mental health, overall stability at home, etc. because it just showed me that parents can be wrong, and sometimes the people closest to you don't always  know what's best for you. I re-read the book a couple days ago, and posted about it ok my instagram story, and about how it probably saved my life and helped me find myself, and tagged the author. A few minutes later, the author responded in dms saying how much it meant to him that the story helped someone. (it was a story about a gay greek kid who is abused by his parents, and it was based off the authors childhood.) Needless to say, I was over the moon, but can't tell my family. He has no idea how happy he made me, and how much that book changed my life for the better."

AskReddit,fj20teq,t1_fj1hzro,1582932013.0,"listen. human being. (i would say sir or mam but i don't know which one it is nor do i know the gender non conforming version off the top of my head.) 
You exist. 
First of all, that in itself is an achievement. Because existing is whack. Need i say more?
Second. what did you do today? did you get up and shower? Excellent! self care! showers are really good for you! did you go to work or school? amazing! even if you feel like garbage sometimes getting stuff done helps, and even if it doesn't, it helps knowing stuff is out of the way! did you just lay in bed and sleep all day? fabulous! you knew something wasn't right, or just needed a lie in and took the time you needed for yourself and slept! cry all day? crying is great! it flushes out toxins and helps reset your body! even if you just got up today that's great. because sometimes getting out of bed is the hardest part. and if you didn't, if you stayed in bed, that's good too some days we need rest! we need a warm comfy bed to lay on and cry or sleep, or scroll through reddit. 
the point is, you're here.
that in itself is incredible. 
if you need to talk, my inbox is open.
but you're here as a human bean. you're amazing. and imma beat you up if you say otherwise."
AskReddit,fj1zzvr,t1_fj1hw96,1582931543.0,"hey, sometimes we all have shit days, and emotions run wild. crying can be fantastic for you actually. it gets rid of toxins, helps elevate stress, and just kinda gives you a mental break! sleep is great too. sometimes after a good cry your body needs sleep to kinda reset. and if ur family doesn't get that, they're silly. because we all have crappy days. but it's gonna get better, get some food in you, go for a quick walk, and let things get back up to the good places!"
AskReddit,fj1zqto,t1_fj1hpod,1582931407.0,"i feel you. i was off for a couple days earlier this week and shit sucked. but it's alright. you're going to get your refill, you're going back on them, and you're gonna feel better in no time!! cudos to you for getting the help you need!"
