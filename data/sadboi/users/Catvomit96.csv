intj,fpravc4,t3_gezhmo,1588848609.0,"I came to this conclusion a long time ago: here's what I did.

Regarding news, it's a profitable business and thus it will always be about reporting stories that will get the most attention. Thus, I mostly avoid the news and when I do hear about events, I ask myself what they're not telling me. Is this the best response? Probably not.

Regarding people's selfishness, you're right that we're all out for ourselves, but can you blame us? When it comes down to it, I'm the only one in my life who I can count on to act in my best interests. The same goes for everyone else, but in this regard, none of us are particularly malicious for being selfish. 

Regarding human stupidity, it's been around forever, it's just nowadays we hear a lot more of it. If you think back, theres always been some monumental stupidity for as long as people have been around, the modern day is no different. I think it's important to remember that all of us are capable of the stupidest stuff. From there, I try to be able to laugh at myself when I realize that I've done something stupid, otherwise the self-criticism would be unbearable.

TL:DR: these are persisting problems but theres nothing to be done about them as they are inherent to us and our age. Try to learn to ignore them if you can, or not, I'm just as stupid as the next guy."
