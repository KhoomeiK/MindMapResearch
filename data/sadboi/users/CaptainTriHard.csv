HealthAnxiety,f9jtmfg,t1_f9jed9m,1575385466.0,"Yep, you have pretty much exactly what I have. After going through my phase of panic attacks, i haven’t been the same since. I had them because I thought i had a heart condition(heart attacks) but then i started to think i was going crazy. They stopped because i was just fed up, then I started to ‘check’ to see if i was hallucinating/ had symptoms of a mental illness, because i kept reading up on schizophrenia and psychosis, freaking myself out. 
So I developed a habit of like you said being hyperaware of my vision and so now i constantly see visual snow everywhere, and theres lots of transparent swirly lines in my vision or just lines, dots. I look at a blank wall and i see more than just the wall you know, hard to explain. And when theres a flash of light i start to overthink it and almost freak out. I get the image stuff too. When i close my eyes mainly when I’m sleeping i see really random, incredibly detailed images pop up, and I can’t control what i see either. It can be scary if its constant and i cant get rid of it. I noticed, i was shoe shopping online for hours, then when i close my eyes i could see detailed pictures of shoes, its so weird. They have kind of stopped actually. But the visual snow and all that feels like its just how my vision works, i just gotta get used to it. Oh yeah i feel like i get longer than normal light trails too when i move an object in-front of my eyes.
But yeah, i think its just we have really over analytical brains man, thanks for replying."

My friend had herpees before and just like you i got paranoid i would contract it because i shared the same bottle as him. Luckily I didnt, however it is unlikely even if you do come into contact. If you havent kissed that person or shared drinks, then theres nothing to worry about. Plus if you do get it its not the end of the world. Millions of people have all sorts of diseases.

Best thing to do is actively try and find proof, instead of sitting back trying to convince yourself

I know honesty is key with your partner, so that first conversation was good, but clearly it hasn’t satisfied you enough. Cheaters are excellent liars and manipulators. Talking about how you feel won’t really go anywhere. The best you can do is ask her questions about her behaviour such as the money."
