I still run M+ on him and he's still 447 ilvl, but I've not touched the War campaign other than what's required. I have no interest in fighting between the factions, my goal is to help those in need and fulfill my role as Highlord. I am now known as the Lightbringer, and it is a title I am very proud to have. I am very devoted to the light and see the true evil that is the void, and do all I can to fight it. 

My main for this expansion is a female Blood Elf Rogue, my devotion is to Silvermoon and I will put the needs of the Sin'dorei above all else, even the Horde. My loyalty is to Silvermoon first, however I do respect the Horde for accepting my people when the Alliance cast us out. I have no problems gutting any alliance I see. This is essentially also the same role as my Male Blood elf hunter, who basically feels the same.

My male Mag'har Orc Warrior is in a world that is foreign to him, but has accepted his new home and has pure loyalty for the Horde he has joined. He is from the Frostwolf clan and knows all of Thrall and the great warrior his father was. Although the world is new to him, he's doing his best to settle down and build his new life in Durotar."

Honestly what's the difference in you joining a pug and creating your own pug and pushing the key? Druid is not the issue, you're not tanking super high keys, druids are more than capable of doing 15-18s. You also said you're only chesting 10s and 11s, that's a problem. As the tank you set the pace, perhaps you're not pulling as much as you should or doing optimal routes.

People are always going to fuck up but higher io players in my experience are better at quickly correcting the fuck ups and not turning it into a dead key over it. In my opinion the lower io groups are far more toxic than the higher ones. Why accept a 1200io tank that's never done a 13 when I can wait for one who has. The difference between an 11 and a 13 is someone decent. Good thing for you is you're a tank, you can push your own keys and be extra picky on who you accept."
