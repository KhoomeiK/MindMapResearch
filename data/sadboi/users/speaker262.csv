Honestly we just had to go through it and realize WHY these two personalities were acting like that. It fucking sucked 🤷🏻 the personalities were created through trauma and what happened was their adaptation to it. The reason the first host was throwing their stuff away was because he had bad experiences with it. I don’t think we “integrated” as much as found a middle ground and don’t hate ourselves/ourself as much. Realizing it’s not us it’s the people that traumatized us that suck.

People come here when they’re having a crisis and need a self place to vent and get advice from other systems. It’s great that you took psych 101 and you’re interested in psychology but poking at survivors of extreme trauma because you think it’s interesting is harmful and not nice. Please go to ask DID if you want to go somewhere where the actual goal is to ask someone with DID and they’re in a safe enough place in their head to respond.

This is a response to my own personal very negative experiences. If you’re offended or can’t relate that’s wonderful. Take it with a grain of salt."

They can bend space and time so I believe what language you speak to them in is irrelevant. Any communication with a spirit I’ve had has been psychic so I don’t think they care as far as communication? I think it’s disrespectful to do that thing where you try to trick them and bully them with a Hebrew god. That sounds like a bad idea. I also don’t know what they’d want from me that they couldn’t get themselves? Also people seem to jump straight into handing over their soul like did you negotiate?

Thanks for sharing! It’s so hard to find anyone to talk to as I immerse myself into the study of magick. I have so many vivid memories of demons and ceremonies. I feel obsessed. I believe a lot of the practices were Druidic and I’ve seen some videos and pictures of the Illuminati and i have memories associated with it. I’ve tried to share about myself with others and they believe me to be completely insane. It’s very challenging. 

I have similar memories of something similar to that. The children were made to fight and kill each other. I remember I had a friend they sacrificed. It’s a completely different culture. I feel like the more I assimilate myself into these various personalities and the longer I spend sober the more I feel like a lost foreigner but no one believes where I’m from."
