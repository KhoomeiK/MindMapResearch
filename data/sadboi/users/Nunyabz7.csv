We're talking about OP's situation and he said they do have assigned parking. I've never seen a complex without one. Not saying they don't exist, but it's rare.

>assume OPs spot was closer than the designated spot

About 12, 13 yrs ago when I lived in an apartment, my neighbor would park in my assigned spot even though it was actually further from his apartment. It made no sense. We tried talking to him numerous times. Didn't work, so we spoke to management, who talked to the neighbor, numerous times. That didn't even work. Luckily we didn't live there too long, but that shit was never resolved. So he can continue that shit with the new residents.

>didn't abuse [you letting them park there]

Most likely they will. Some people just don't care about other people's space, property, or whatever. They'll get in the habit of parking there and it'll be hard to cut that shit out.

You're gullible if you think she's pregnant. Let me guess, she also has cancer. Free pass to do whatever the hell you want!

If she even is pregnant, and they have 2 cars, then the husband should park in overflow parking and leave their designated spot for the wife.
