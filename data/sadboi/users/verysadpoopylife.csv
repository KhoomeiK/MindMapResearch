SuicideWatch,eyu14qi,t1_eytz6mc,1567450370.0,"Well I have been suicidal and depressed since 11.

I work in shitty job for my friends mom whom doesnt really like me. My mom died 3 months ago (almost 4) right in between the time when I wanted to start my own business. Everyone has let me down, and I struggle to work on my business and cant handle even the easiest tasks at my current job.

&#x200B;

I want out, but I almost lost all hope. But not all of it. Tiny amount of it still exists just to prolongue my suffering so I cant kill myself."
SuicideWatch,eytz1jt,t1_eytwbh5,1567448899.0,Yeah...at least I can let it all out here.
SuicideWatch,eytxzhi,t3_cyfpuu,1567448158.0,"Yeah man, I feel you...that is why I started to keep these thoughts for myself.

I even dont talk about my depression anymore with anyone I know IRL.

Its always either ""I know it must be hard for yourself and I cannot possibly imagine how it feels but you have to be strong and it will get better"" or in worse cases""There are people with worse problems. Get your shit together and dont be lazy.""

&#x200B;

I mean f\*\*k off. I dont even know if Id be happy if I won the lottery. I would probably be still miserable. I dont see any point in life nor am I brave enough to take my life, because of pain. Furthermore I am not exactly sure if I would take my own life if I wouldnt end up like in ""hell"" or something. Wouldnt it be so tragicomical. To end your suffering here and hell would exist? I mean it would be funny because who would have thought. Like probably Stephen Hawking would end up there. 

And last but not least. Hope. That motherfluffing bitch. I am not the first to say that nor the last. But, most of the times it just prolongues your suffering. It is like procrastinating on whole new level. Postponing the inevitable. I mean what is even the point of life if I cant even enjoy it.

The last person that I loved and lived for (mom) never achieved anything and died suddenly. So yeah fukkk life.

sry for diarrhea"
SuicideWatch,ey4x5rm,t1_exlsp0o,1566812771.0,"Hey Guys...

thank you for trying to calm me down.

I am sorry for late response, but I did not know what to say.

I guess the point is that I see no point in living. Honestly I dont think I believe in anything at this stage. I believed for a moment after it happened that mom is in better place. But I dont think there is a such thing as afterlife anymore. I read some things mom used to write for herself. She had so many things planned when we would improve our situation. But obviously that didnt happen. I dont know. Night before it happened we fought. We take everything for granted. I just want to reverse time. But thats who I am. Things that I cant have make me mad.

I dont think I look forward for future anymore. I dont even know whats happy anymore. I felt like this for a long time. I think last week was hardest particularly, because I lost 500 usd due to very sudden expense and I realised that if something happens I am not financialy independent..."
