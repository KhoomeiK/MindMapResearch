I say somehow because I pass a Male 100% of the time..you would then revert to addressing me as female  ? That's dumb as fuck man. In a real life scenario you'd just make yourself look like an idiot at least. What do you even know about basic biology when you cant grasp the fact that HRT works? Also your first 2 points are wrong, theres a reason transitioning is the medical treatment for being trans, and it's been dropped as a mental disorder for some time now. No ones asking you to 'play along' because it's not a fucking game, it is a medical condition, and lucky for us, your personal opinions dont get to determine what kind of medical treatment other people can receive.  

I'm gonna guess you're one of those people that think you can tell by looking at someone if they are trans. Lol."

Pre t I found working out, lifting weights helped my posture. Wearing a packer taught me how to walk more like a guy. As for the emotional thing or lack thereof, I still struggle with that myself but therapy has been helping, and finding people online to talk to has helped as well, I've realized that a lot of cis guys are a lot more emotional than they let on most of the time, especially when its anonymously behind a keyboard.  

   And sometimes, to be frank, its safer for me to put on that mask of not feeling. I broke down in front of my landlord and the mail lady like a month ago or something and they made me feel like I was a freak for having that kind of emotion. My therapist was like 'well duh you come across pretty masculine and people dont see a grown man cry everyday.' I do generally try to keep that kind of intense emotion to myself but as awkward as it was, I realized I felt better after crying, it was a huge catharsis. I needed it or I'd have held all that in, be it anger or sadness or whatever. I also recently got a punch bag and that helps quite a bit lol. Hang in there, as corny as this is it can get better."
