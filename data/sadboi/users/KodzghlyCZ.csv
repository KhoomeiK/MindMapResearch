depression,f1em65o,t3_d94mlz,1569425360.0,"Same thing happens to me. For me surviving every single next day is really challenging, because I got sick really bad, so I can't go anywhere, I stay in room with my brother, because I don't have separate room and every day is completely the same. The only thing I can use is my phone, so day after day, everything seems to be perfectly the same. I often even skip going to the kitchen to get some food, because I don't care anymore...

&#x200B;

But YOU, if you can stand on your own feet, if you can breath without anyones help, just go outside. Explore the world, help the people. When I was healthy enought to be able to walk outside, I was going through my city exploring all kinds of different places, talking to junkies, homeless people, I even went to some ghettos to see how life works here. Some days I walked over 30km without even stopping, because there was always new path to explore. Even if you feel like shit, I really recomend to go outside, you can always find a place without people. I don't have anyone mentally supporting me in the way I would need to, but I once said ""Don't rely on anybody, even yourself."", so if You don'T have anyone You can rely on, try to walk, really. That's my only advice"
sad,f0zhrim,t3_d770do,1569095790.0,"Bro there's nothing to celebrate on birthday... IMHO you just getting older and that sucks. Don't waste your time celebrating one more year closer to your death, enjoy life, fuck everybody, do what you want. Be glad that nobody anoys you. You can do sooo much stuff, just concentrate on yourself. Hope you'll get better at some point in life."
