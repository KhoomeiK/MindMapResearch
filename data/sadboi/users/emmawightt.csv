EstrangedAdultChild,f50qi4x,t3_dmi09f,1571931361.0,"more context: my aunt is from my fathers side. my mom is not fluent in english whatsoever. this leads to me doing everything for her, now that my sister moved away to college. she always tries to guilt trip me about how ‚Äúi know you think the wrong parent died‚Äù ‚Äúi‚Äôm so useless, i should no longer stay in america. i should just move back‚Äù ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt love me‚Äù ‚Äúi have no friends and family‚Äù etc 
this has always made others including myself feel bad for her, but she has tried NOTHING to learn english, or go out and meet new people. it just frustrates me when she plays the victim. when my dad died of course it was hard on all of us, but my mom and dad have been divorced for a couple years by then, my mom HATED my dad. would talk shit about him anytime i brought him up or asked if i could go over to his during the weekend. yet when he died, she was all sad and got support from everyone. it‚Äôs like she ran off of other pity. i don‚Äôt even know what to think of her anymore"
