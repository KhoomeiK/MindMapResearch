We called a local exterminator who stopped by to check it out, and then he set up an appointment to spray the spots in our basement/crawlspace where they liked to hide or where they were coming in from outside. We were able to stay in the house. And within 3 days, they were gone from that day on."

ExpectationVsReality,ev8pjyu,t1_ev83k99,1564286989.0,"So true! The review:


Looks good in landscape mode but freakishly terrifying in portrait.
I feel there should have been more emphasis on the lower portion of the teddy bear. The photos mostly show a proportional torso and typically oversized head as is common in large, human-sized teddy bears. Where the emphasis is lacking is in the giant pendulous legs that haunt the lower two thirds of this stuffed freak bear. It appears to be some sort of bipedal giraffe bear hybrid. After we took him out of the box with my daughters, I expected it to hop up and sprint away down the street with a fingerless fist raised in victory. My daughter tries to hug the bear and she gets trapped in a serpentine mass of bear legs. She won't keep it in her room anymore because her friends won't visit because of the nightmares. Joyfay should sell some sort of amputation and patch kit for parents that want a more desirable short legged bear."
