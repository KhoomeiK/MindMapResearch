depression,fqdljoo,t3_gi9th2,1589292163.0,"for me at least, if i hold off on the urge to cut or kill myself, i end up thinking about what i am intending on doing. ending my life forever, gone. lights out. no one in your family or any of your friends or teachers or those acquaintances at school that you had funny conversations with in class will ever talk to you again. you would never reply to another question, or have another conversation. even if you don‚Äôt think anyone cares about you, trust me. there is someone that loves you out there. just think really hard about it. people would cry if you were gone. people at your school would hear about it and your teachers and everyone would be so sad. they would remember you for a long long time. that crush that you didn‚Äôt know liked you back will never get to tell you. and after thinking about all of that, it pulls me back into reality. at least for a little while. then i‚Äôll have to do it all over again. but at least it keeps me alive/unharmed."
depression,fqdkt0v,t1_fqdcacg,1589291749.0,"yes, but how is someone supposed to change their attitude if they‚Äôve already given up? physically and mentally (i don‚Äôt mean this to be rude)"
depression,fqdkl87,t1_fqdjjcq,1589291626.0,what if someone is super depressed and genuinely need affection and they get lots of it and appreciate it but they are just so depressed that no amount of affection/attention will help them? you don‚Äôt know everyone‚Äôs life story.

relationship_advice,fmdi5sf,t1_fmd9fwe,1585968438.0,"i agree, and disagree.  the intent behind using the word doesn‚Äôt always make the weight of the word.  what if a white person just used it in a sentence without any intent of hurting anyone.  that still would be looked down upon, and who knows, he could get beat up lol.  i do agree that the word is disgusting no matter who says it.  i feel like most people who use the n word don‚Äôt actually know where it came from, or its origin.  it was a word white people used to call black people when they were slaves.  it‚Äôs a degrading word.  i get that white people arent supposed to say it, but i don‚Äôt even know why a black person would WANT to use the n word.  isn‚Äôt it insulting to them?  why would they want to say a word that was used to insult them when they were slaves?  it doesn‚Äôt make any sense why anyone can/wants to say it."

sex,fklfhle,t1_fkl0fi4,1584305193.0,that is a horrible truth. i wish i could see what it‚Äôd be like if that didn‚Äôt exist. but it will always be happening.
sex,fklf94r,t1_fkl19nh,1584305049.0,"well, sexuality has evolved greatly with society and everything. i do think that men may be meant to have a higher sex drive for reproduction, but nowadays people have sex for pleasure and for romance, so i think that men and women are about the same regarding sex drive."
sex,fkkv9t6,t3_fj1pck,1584292663.0,"because some of that is true. i think evolutionary a woman is looking for one man to have sex with and help take care of her child, but men are supposed to have sex with as many women as possible to create more babies. i think it‚Äôs biological. 

men have millions of sperm, and women only have one egg per month. that says something. and a man isn‚Äôt going to want to take care of a baby that isn‚Äôt his, generally. unless they are caring and/or adopting. but you can‚Äôt really adopt in caveman times/times long ago from now, and that is what i‚Äôm referring to."
sex,fkkumcj,t3_fj1pck,1584292281.0,"because men rape more people than women and are generally psychically stronger, so people are more afraid of them and view some as ‚Äúanimals‚Äù.  i do not agree with this. men do rape more people than women, but that shouldn‚Äôt generalize what is said about all men. men and women are both humans. they both have emotions. men can be just as emotional sexually as women can be. and women can also be ‚Äúlike men‚Äù sexually. it just depends on the person. society generalizes and stereotypes genders and that‚Äôs no secret."
depressed,fjz6zan,t1_fjyr8ri,1583712826.0,"your problem, even if there is no physical problem you can think of, is just as valid as anyone elses ‚Äúproblems‚Äù. just because nothing in your life is physically as bad as anyone else‚Äôs, doesn‚Äôt mean that you‚Äôre supposed to be perfectly happy all the time. you‚Äôre allowed to be sad and have problems. remember, it‚Äôs okay to not be okay."
sex,fjz5s5u,t1_fjz2xca,1583712033.0,"i think you‚Äôll be okay, i‚Äôve been so paranoid exactly like this a few times before, and everything was okay. you used a condom, and only a tiny percentage of the time you can get pregnant with a condom, and even a smaller percentage to get pregnant by precum. it‚Äôs best not to spend your time worrying unless she does text you or something and tell you that she is pregnant (which most likely won‚Äôt happen)."
