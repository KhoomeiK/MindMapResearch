(b) To receive medical information for your healthcare purposes now and in the future, for yourself and children you may have someday, so that you have as a medical history as complete as possible.

(c) To seem out/learn personal info about the donor, such as his identity, what he looks like, etc. [I see this as violating his request for anonymity]

(d) To seem our/learn about/reach out to relatives of the donor (other than the children created via his anonymous sperm donation)- people who are genetically your grandparents, aunts/uncles, and cousins.

Also, keep in mind that the word “violate” usually holds a connotation of being related to the legality of an issue.

There is no record of marriage for him until 1973, and the bride's name is unavailable. However, there is a marriage certificate #, so you can order a copy of it from the state of Florida and see what it says.

I don't know their current address, but as of 2005 they lived in Delray Beach (and before that they lived in nearby towns like Pompano Beach). You can order a background report at various places online, if you want, if you are interested in contacting Geraldine to see what she might know about your grandfather and his relatives.

The gist of the article was that the people needed food stamps or food cupboards aren’t just the people who “look like it,” and the shame this woman was made to feel because she had nice a few nice things.  

For example she had a newer (say, 3-5 years d, paid off) reliable car that didn’t require much in the way of upkeep. She would get shamed by people for it, that she should sell it and use the money to buy food and pay bills, that she was selfish. In the article she spelled out the facts about how,  if she sold the car, for much less than she paid for it, and bought an older, cheaper, more “poor acceptable” vehicle, such a vehicle would most likely be less gas efficient, requiring more $ needed/spent for gas, it would need costly repairs on a regular basis, it would handle worse on slippery roads, possibly causing an accident that would cost a lot to repair or replace, higher chance of driver/passenger injuries in an accident, meaning time off work and missing income plus medical bills, etc.  

Same sort of thing about a long winter coat her mother had given to her many years ago, one that was good quality and very warm, but looked   too nice for her to be wearing, as someone needing financial assistance. Should she sell a 10+ coat for maybe $30 (as selling used clothing doesn’t get nearly actual value of the coat) and buy a cheaper coat that would wear out quickly and not keep her as warm?

I’ve often heard people say “Don’t buy cheap things that will wear out - it’s more expensive in the long run. Spend a little more for quality and take care of it, and it will save you money in the long run as you’ll get lots of use out of it.”  But some of those same people are the ones who think only certain people should have nice things.

In the face of someone confronting/attacking your wife, I know the answer isn’t as simple as “Your wife should tell the woman...” because that woman deserves NO explanation nor does your wife owe anyone an explanation.  

Maybe you can get your wife’s “mama bear” instincts to rise a bit - the woman insulted your daughter’s desire and ability to gift her mother with something special.  As a mom, that would get me fired up a bit. ;-)

I’m sorry there are people who treated your wife that way."

science,eykc2qj,t1_eykb3vv,1567144453.0,"Your scope is too small for what I’m asking to be considered.  You are limiting your though experiment to 2 males and 2 females.  If you look at family compositions though the past 2+ millennia at least, as well as society sizes (small through large) the average would not be a situation of 2 males and 2 females.  Using different, larger numbers of humans of age to procreate (or not - in the case of some homosexuals and some heterosexuals who aren’t able to have offspring even though they are of childbearing age), running different scenarios with a varied # of:
* Hetero males who can impregnate a woman, 
* Hetero males who cannot impregnate woman,
* Hetero males who don’t mate with a woman for one reason or another,
* Homo males who can impregnate a woman, 
* Homo males who who cannot impregnate a woman,
* Homo males who don’t mate with a woman did one reason or another,

As well as:
* Hetero females who are fertile,
* Hetero females who are not fertile,
* Hetero females who are fertile but cannot give birth to a living baby,
* Hetero females who may or may be fertile, may or may not be able to give birth to a living baby, because for some reason or another they never mated with a male (Hetero or Homo)

And: 
* Homo females who are fertile,
* Homo females who are not fertile,
* Homo females who are fertile but cannot give birth to a living baby,
* Homo females who may or may be fertile, may or may not be able to give birth to a living baby, because for some reason or another they never mated with a male (Hetero or Homo),

science,eykaudy,t1_eyk9vue,1567143027.0,"Biological abilities doesn’t alway equal real-life occurrences. While there is proof from historical references about, for example, homosexual men needing to live a heterosexual life to cover for their true mature in various modern societies, it is not true of ALL homosexuals, in ALL societies, throughout ALL time.  Often times in data, the outlying data can be as important/more important than the data’s average values.

While humans throughout time have been very susceptible to behaving as their society norms dictate, that provided skewed data as those people fitting in are not behaving as they would if no societal ideals were put upon them."
science,eyk86p5,t1_eyjxmy2,1567140143.0,">	First of all, if the homo was male, it won't do squat...

I disagree with this. Homosexual males, at least ones who do not father children, are thus males without the drive/need/responsibility to care for ones own children that is felt by/put upon heterosexual males with children, as they themselves have fathered no children.

As such, homosexual males without young are in a unique position to often provide more support to adults AND children in their community. 

Example: Hetero Male + Hetero Female with children (esp when # of children is greater than # of parents, or family members are sick, away, etc): Homosexual male without children can help provide resources and support to the parents of the children, and provide additional support to those children as they grow, resulting in stronger/healthier adults and children in that family.

As for a homosexual woman, while a male can impregnate multiple females, maybe biologically/sociologically/anthropologically it is best for humans to “pair off” (not necessarily 1 man 1 woman, but maybe 1 man 2-3 women, who knows). Women in competition for a male who will give them offspring, protection and sustenance would view other women as competition.  Perhaps homosexual women are a biological offshoot of competition between women for men. A homosexual woman could be a trusted friend for a female, someone a heterosexual woman wouldn’t need to compete against, someone a Hetero woman/mother could count on for emotional and work support.

Just my thoughts."
