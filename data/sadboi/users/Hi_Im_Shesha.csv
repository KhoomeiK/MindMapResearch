tarotpractice,filvzpc,t1_filviqu,1582511675.0,"Sometimes.

There are times where I donâ€™t even grab a tarot deck, I just use oracle cards... depends on the readings. 

Last night I used a spirit animal deck and had a huge message come through Just with that deck.

I Love using oracle cards for myself cause Iâ€™m still trying to learn the meanings of tarot cards."
tarotpractice,filvfid,t3_f8k0em,1582511288.0,"I actually prefer oracle cards cause my intuition just kicks in. 
Theyâ€™re great for getting clarity on a tarot reading."

tarotpractice,fhx9u27,t3_f557fs,1581949004.0,"Thank you for such a detailed response. You were  almost spot on... I came out of a 6 year long depression, and I have been working relentlessly on myself so I NEVER go back to that mindset cause I almost died. My cousin also committed suicide as well, and unfortunately In life we werenâ€™t as close as I would have liked. 

My cousin was such a light to our family, heâ€™s a male, but he was soooo very nurturing to our entire family when he was alive. When he committed suicide it was a complete and utter shock to our family, but that night he came to me In a dream I shrugged it off cause I wasnâ€™t capable at that time to see what he wanted to tell me. 

Thank you for your response! I so appreciate it. 

Hope your situation works out the best for you!"
depression,fhwt728,t3_f51oky,1581929017.0,"I felt this way for 6 years I stuck around for my son... I was able to get better, you all can as well, just keep fighting for the ones you love.


And this goes to EVERYONE: The Universe rewards those who love deeply, and anyone willing to torture themselves by hanging on, is worth fighting for. You all are clearly loved by someone (yes pets count) so I know you all are loving.  

I recommend lying to yourself everyday, by saying  I love you to yourself in the mirror, or record a video or voice memo and play it every day. One day the lie will turn into truth. 

Positive thoughts and energy going out to all of you!"
depression,fhwqqx1,t1_fhwqob4,1581925740.0,Thank you! I want to get input from others because depression can take many different forms and I can only speak on my own experience.
