Maybe he would be shocked and embarrassed and stop that one time, but kids get really emotional and throw tantrums because they can’t effectively control their emotions like adults normally can, it wouldn’t stop that kid forever. There’s just no way that in three months the kids gonna get upset and think about the one time his mom threw a tantrum, because tantrums are normal, as frustrating as they are. They can’t handle all that emotion in a tiny body, if your kid never throws tantrums they either have an extremely calm demeanor, or they’re abused and scared to act out.

Corporations have always been the biggest problem, prioritizing profit and convenience over sustainability is a problem so deeply rooted in our society, that people fight you on the statement that, “hey, maybe it would be cool if you made a small change to reduce your use of single use plastic” it’s not that straws are the biggest problem, it’s that people aren’t even making an effort. Because of how capitalism works (I’m speaking of course from my perspective from the United States) companies aren’t going to change unless we demand it, if there’s no one using single use plastic, they don’t want to spend the money on those products. So why can’t we put in that little bit of effort? Stores are getting rid of plastic bags without a charge, and it’s small but it does matter.

I’ve worked with many kids of many ages for many years. I’ve taken human development and child development classes. I know kids very well, and they are perceptive as fuck, they understand marriage, of course kids can get weird ideas of what things are, but if they have parents who are married they’re probably gonna get it. They are perceptive of more than just what you tell them, and because relationships with others are such a core part of humanity, we are hard wired to model our idea of love and marriage after what we see. Unless this is a married couple that never even touches each other, the kid will know that the parents kiss and the parents are married, otherwise it’s an odd situation beyond what I’ve seen. 5 year olds are also rarely worried about “cooties” in my experience, that tends to come later, around age 9 or so when a kid has matured a little more. Outliers exist of course but kids are smarter than people give them credit for."

I’m not saying whether that’s possible, but what you outlined would just be a more effective treatment, NOT a cure, which isn’t the point of the post. OP is essentially saying if there was some magic pill you could take that would get rid of diabetes forever, it wouldn’t be profitable because I can pay for it once and never have diabetes again, even if it’s expensive, a diabetic reliant on insulin is making them money, I believe insulin costs around $10 to make if I’m remembering correctly, and it’s sold for around $300. So.

Much of your routine will depend on what skin type and concerns you have, if your skin is dry, a hydrating facewash and moisturizer are definitely a priority, but if you have oily skin, you’re going to want to go a different route (I have dry/sensitive skin so I can’t help much with an oily skin routine) my typical routine involves a facewash, a toner (not witch hazel or anything with alcohol, those will dry your skin out like hell), and a moisturizer, as well as a solid face mask.
I love lush, but they can be pricey of course, there’s also a lot of drugstore brands that are fantastic, I like Aveeno, CeraVe, and Cetaphil personally. Lush has fantastic masks and a super great rose and lavender toner that I use regularly (plus they are a super ethical brand!), I also love the aveeno cream cleanser with salicylic acid when my breakouts are bad.
Hope some of this helped, I’ve used a lot of products over time and I’m still figuring out what works best for my skin, so I suggest doing some online research as well! it can be a long process, but I’ve helped my skin a lot too, and it’s been worth it for sure."
