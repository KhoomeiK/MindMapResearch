depression,ffp6uwy,t3_eu7fur,1580087715.0,"i wanted to kill myself for so long. All my teachers constantly bullied me, my brother didnt give a shit, my parents never understood me and my friends all left me. One day I stayed up all night doing some stupid project and the whole night I kept having thoughts of jumping off the stairs, hitting my head resulting in my death. I went downstairs to the kitchen grabbed a knife and started imagining how it would look if I did it. Then I pussied out and put it away. Yes, life is a hell but remember, your life will be over the moment you decide it is"

But the people I see on social media, are people I see irl, and they have so many friends and they just look truly happy. The person who was supposed to be my best friend, my brother didn't even care to talk much. When I go outside, I look around to see other people with friends and siblings just playing like they really love each other. They fool around, their family is open etc. I am scared to go outside because my bullies are outside, and I'm constantly reminded how sad my life is."
