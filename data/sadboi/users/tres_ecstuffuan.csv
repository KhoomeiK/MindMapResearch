Criminality is not something that black people are biologically or culturally predisposed to as much as the right would like to suggest it is. 

Some black people think getting disrespected is reason to murder someone. Usually these individuals have been shaped by being involved in the drug trade.

While I agree with you that, In general if your player character is hitting on other player characters because their player and the pc happen to be women then that is a sign of meta-gaming and potentially of sexual harassment (never mind a general clumsiness with the opposite sex), sex and romance have a place in roleplaying games just like they have a place in any other form of storytelling whether it be film or books.

I think people for some very understandable reasons are beginning to walk on eggshells within rpgs and honestly maybe that’s for the best if that means more women in the hobby

But games like vampire the masquerade got women and lgbtq people into the hobby partially by putting romance and sensuality in the forefront.

I think what the above commenter is saying is that the barrier to entry, the huge down payment is the unethical part and people should be able to get home loans from the bank to own their properties without such a huge down payment. Everyone should be able to own their domiciles and the fact that they don’t is a massive imbalance of power between renters and landlords. I was very fortunate to be in the circumstance where I could make a down payment on a home.

It actually makes me feel better knowing I’m not the only one going through this. 

I just wanted to know if this was unusual. Knowing it’s not makes me feel way better and will help my anxiety."

This isn’t going away any time soon though. 

Perhaps I’m still in shock that I won’t see my girlfriend potentially for a year."
relationship_advice,fm5ngr7,t1_fm5n6nd,1585776271.0,"Maybe I’ll see if that’s something I could do and see if that will make any difference. 

It just seems insane not to see someone you love for potentially a year.

But I suppose we live in insane times"

Slowly draining your life away"

nyc,fl1ys7k,t1_fl1yo2g,1584739152.0,But it’s totally impossible racial stereotypes play into who people want to fuck right?
nyc,fl1eowr,t1_fl1eeny,1584727510.0,"It doesn’t inherently but it absolutely can. It can also work in reverse because someone is attracted to a race of people because of an ugly stereotype, like a preference for Asian women because they are submissive and demure. 

I think I don’t date X and I only date X are often based in ugly racial stereotypes. It isn’t always but I would say it’s more often than not based in racism.

Not to say a preference is always based in racism, but it absolutely can be."

CapitalismVSocialism,fkgtxzs,t1_fkgtr9w,1584174145.0,"Ok it’s clear your not trying to have a conversation in good faith. You referenced countries that have such things but then suggest I’m somehow “making shit up”. 

If the capitalist is only making pennies on the dollar for a worker, why employ them? If they provide no value they wouldn’t have a job

The answer to your question is the same thing that happens to people who don’t pay their taxes."
