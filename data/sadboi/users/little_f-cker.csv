That kind of thought seems otherworldly to me."

Perhaps though she just doesn't want to believe it. Sorry that that's happening."

Good post man"

I've never been bored a day in my life, I guess perhaps I don't understand them or maybe they are just an incredibly boring individual... They might as well be telling me, ""I have absolutely nothing to do, my brain is partly dead and cannot distract me or find something to do, let me just go to you for entertainment."". No, if you want entertainment go watch the office. 

Sorry, this sort of turned into a rant."
