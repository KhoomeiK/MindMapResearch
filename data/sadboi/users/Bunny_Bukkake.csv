I tried the cage thing, putting her away at night and she would grind on the bars all night long. I leave her plenty of nighttime food...but she acts up and she's trained me around 3am unfortunately to wake to give her more to quiet down. I'm still looking for ways to change her behavior. I've noticed soft woods (untreated balsa from the dollhouse section of the craft store) or chewing treats really keep the noise down but she still kicks a stink. They said spaying her would help but she's been fixed for almost half a year and nothing has changed."

bipolar,fms2ou0,t1_fmrsmq8,1586344560.0,"Hey OP, similar to the above poster, I have had a skin-pick issue most of my life. It started as stressfully plucking loose eyelashes or eyebrow hair, then it became digging my scalp. That one hasn't stopped. It's therapeutic like massaging your temples, the pressure and release. But it has resulted in thinned spots of hair, and worse, constant bloody scalp. Which makes me pick those scabs freshly into new sores. And so shampoo/conditioner is particularly painful like acid on the fresh wounds and I'm grateful for thick Indian hair. My only method for coping is to cut my nails down until they're nonexistent nubs on my fingertips. I also use menthol shampoos to remind me of the hurt I'm causing, like...negative reinforcement. There's a spray I use to regrow and strengthen hair I spritz in when damp. I think your gloves idea is absolutely stellar and may try that myself if my hands weren't so hot and clammy all the time üò´"

It definitely was something I struggled with, the manic symptoms lending way to my porn addiction. I've spoke with a cognitive behavioral therapist for a few months about it and perhaps it was just a lack of our personalities meshing, but I found her rather unhelpful. 

Currently, I'm seeking someone well-versed in both my bipolar (I'm experiencing a depressive episode at the moment) and porn addiction/intimacy issues. You really hit the nail on the head! I do hope one day to document my experiences properly to be a resource for other women like myself struggling to reconcile their faith and their sexuality."

I could give them a single day of minimal good luck. Nothing extravagant like a promotion or meeting the love of their life, because I'm not here to mess with fate and junk, but little things like finding $20 in their old jeans or getting double chips from the vending machine."
