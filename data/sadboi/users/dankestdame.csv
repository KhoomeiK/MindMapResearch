WomensHealth,fqnjpgq,t3_gjwpkz,1589496074.0,I have been going through lumps in the breast and had ultrasounds on my breasts two times and an xray of them. Nothing was found. They said it was just hard tissue and to cut caffeine out of my diet. I just recently started doing so. I'm month in and they have gone away and my breast feel normal again. Dont know if this helps but I hope it does! I've also been taking vitiman E 400 IU and Vitiman D 1000 IU. She also suggested primrose oil but the pills are very large.

BipolarReddit,fpvuh1h,t3_gftmhn,1588952054.0,I have bipolar and an eating disorder. I would not eat then also binge and purge. But it has gotten so much better and is more under control since I opened up about it to my psych. She keeps an eye on me now which I like. I think my eating disorder was really triggered from watching eating disorder videos on YouTube and it just exasperated the problem.

bipolar,fjk3fd6,t3_fdo4go,1583419160.0,I just started lamotrigine too about 6 days ago now. I havent experienced any of this except the sleepiness I get after I take it but my latuda does that to me too. I'm on 25 mg as well. Was freaking out after the first few days becuase I started to get a sore in my mouth and it could possibly be from the lamotrigine but its healed up now. I get kanker sores and that's what it was I'm sure.

I've tried to accept what I've done to my hair. Good news is it was a semi color so if I dont do anything it should still fade out. I will wash it a million times if it turns green, but I feel like that would be more if I dyed my hair blue. And thank you for sharing some of your hair experiences with me. It makes me feel less alone."

bipolar,fittnb1,t1_fit95lj,1582729154.0,"I would get brain zaps sometimes on other medications, I never knew that was considered a tick. But that went away after I stopped all the different meds I was on. I was on like 5 at once and I was so sleepy 24/7 so I stopped everything. I'm really hoping this lamotrigine helps me. Latuda has really helped but I'm still not quite where i think i could be. 

I'm sorry you have to deal with all of that! That sounds like alot just to have medications that help you feel like yourself. I hope things get better for you and the sleep paralysis stops. I had that before and it was absolutely frightening so I cant imagine having that every night. I also used to not be able to sleep without a light on either. I still get like that at times. And I cannot sleep facing away from the bedroom door. If I face the wall I have anxiety attacks. It's weird. 

Only side effect I've noticed that bothers me is my Latuda. If I dont eat before I take it or when I'm upping the dosage my legs get all tense and crampy. It's horrible. Restless legs as well."
