I hope there is a season 2 as well, but it ended fine if that is all. I think Miles is a good friend to Dex too, but I wanted her to get with Grey from the first episode. I love their relationship so much. I loved it so much when they showed how they became friends. I love how casual he is to her out there personality. I also love that she is a girl who does not conform to society and does her own thing, see bridesmaid dress with her boots. I think Benny is beautiful too, but I want her to be happy and be able to be happy with Grey. I want to also add that I love Ansel and how they show him treated like anyone else and not like he is different. I was so happy when he drove the get away car!"

I was going to visit him out of town this weekend, but with the fact his state had several cases, and mine, at the time was one of three that did not, he did not want to risk me getting sick. So, I asked him out on a different kind of date. I asked him if he would like to do dinner and a movie... on Skype. I am an outside the box thinker, and thought that was a cute idea.

I have so much I want to talk about and ask. For example, I think I am the only person (I am exaggerating) who absolutely loved, no question, Suicide Squad. I watch it all the time and even listen to it when I cannot see it. I saw nothing wrong with it. I watched the first batch of Spiderman, and Christopher Nolan's Batman (even then I did not care that much aside from Heath Ledger), but that is about it. Does Batman Die? What did Batman and Superman battle? Someone told me it was because of all the damage one of them causes the city, and I can get behind that. Whenever I watch movies I am like, ""Look at that mess. Who's going to clean that up? How much will it cost? What do you think the damages are ($)? What about all those cars? Did they die? It is a cycle that never ends. Is Suicide Squad alone it's own comic book? I have never even seen a single Avengers movie. Also, I have never seen, while we are at it, Star Wars. I do not even know what it is about. I like to think it is a space western. DO NOT tell me what it is about! I had a friend who called himself a geek, and he told me to never see them, to always hold that close because no one could take that away from me. I was already 30 by then.

I completely see your point, and as a person who thinks of their pets as a member of the family, I am cool with it. I am not a crazy cat lady though... no. I would do this, I would present it as you are doing her a favor. Make it almost seem like her idea. The smell (I would not worry if this is true, remember she has to think this, your house may smell like a gosh darn garden) from the dog, the habit of the dog wanting to go in the room and disturbing her, the quality of the bed or furniture is not as nice due to being the dog's space, I could go on and on. I have always been told I should have been a lawyer.

Now, as far as her attitude. I could take care of that quickly because I am your stereotypical Southern woman who is wonderful at the sly passive aggressiveness. I would shut it down. I would possible speak to her upfront and let her know that you have been gracious enough to spend time in your home and you do not approve or appreciate drugs in your home, the fact that she goes out at night is just another reason to stay in the den, so she does not wake up the entire family. I would have to set some ground rules for the being out all hours of the day and night. Finally, I would let her know that if she feels that serious about it, and she expects special privileges then she can pay rent. Now, I know I am not a parent or aunt, but I am a former teacher, work with youth now, and have had to set rules, deadlines, and guidelines with people like this or worse, much worse. She will have to learn to conform. She honestly may just be a brat who has never been told the word ""No"" before or not gotten her way. You are a much better person than I. Good Luck, and keep us posted!

Long story short, No."

I am not going to judge anyone, lest not I be judged, or shove my beliefs down someone's throat. I just love. Family is tricky. I was married to an abusive preacher, who is now my ex-husband. Yes, many times I have been treated because religious text was taken out of context and men have picked and chose what portions they wanted to follow. I was once shown a passage to me showing where a parent was not to abuse their child, to which he then went down a few passages to show where parents were to train their child and not spare the rod. Insane. I cannot cut ties because I live in a tiny community where everyone is related somehow, are gossips, and honestly I have enough fear, love, and respect (even now) for my father (parents) that I would never, ever, want their image tarnished. Even if he was to pass away I would never tell this secret to anyone. I do not blame religion, it gives me peace, comfort, and joy.

I am impressed because this was a good team no matter what anyone says. Not everyone picked us during GameDay to win. I will be honest and say it makes me nervous about some of our other games, but so excited for some of them too! For now, War Eagle, and lets keep this train a rolling. And to the guy on Twitter who said he was happy Will Hastings got his head almost knocked off because he has been wanting it to happen, you messed with the wrong girl, and the wrong Family. WDE!"

CFB,ezjmyb8,t3_d15old,1567947083.0,"Oh, and I was appalled when the commentator said that the ""Ride For Rod"" was for his partner, and was glad he finally apologized. It was so insensitive and I am glad he realized his mistake and corrected it."

bisexual,ez9wy4k,t1_ez947ec,1567791029.0,"Oh, an app! I would never say that about a woman. A man maybe... Only kidding. Sorta. No, seriously, I tried a dating app called Her, and it was really nice, I was just too shy. I also grew up in an extremely conservative household, have very judgmental family members, and it is not as easy as if I grew up in a big city. I live in the country, as in there are goats that will be roaming the streets, and we all just let them pass or go around them."
bisexual,ez8z4k2,t1_ez815vc,1567767131.0,"Thank you so much! I actually tried one, but I did not feel like it was for me. It is just all so confusing."
bisexual,ez8z2r0,t1_ez843cz,1567767067.0,Thank you so much. I appreciate all the time you took to reach out. I will be taking your advice and looking around and checking out everyone's thoughts!
truechildfree,ez7kmaq,t3_bzg2jm,1567724923.0,"Is this a thread for someone like me who is childfree, but not necessarily by choice? Where do I turn to? I am childfree and enjoy my me time and alone time, but one day want children. Can anyone point me what group I fit into? It is a real struggle. Being 38F and realizing I may never have them and adopting the attitude that I may never have them and trying to embrace that, but at the same time think maybe I would have them after 40. I feel like I fit in nowhere. Any advice. I am sorry if this sounds dumb, I am just being practical. Looking for encouragement for a life I was not prepared for."

depression,ez6808q,t3_d01jay,1567709778.0,"Do not bottle it up, but this is something I thought of in therapy, I cannot dump all my issues on my sister. She does not want to hear it, sometimes she does not believe it, and it stresses her out too. I have found that if I have therapy twice or three times a month I am much better off. I have bought a cute notebook today to write down my feelings to take to the doctor. I usually put them in a note on my phone, or even email it to myself, but this way I can get it down right then. I also find it is good to take a blank word document and write how I feel like I am going to send it to a friend and then just email it to myself. I keep it for later to share with my therapist or psychiatrist and I can get how I am feeling at that exact moment on the record instead of going in and saying I am fine or feeling a little low when it is actually not good at all. I do this because my sister cannot handle it, and my parents think I am stupid and ridiculous. I found out recently I have a cyst on my brain and may have a nerve disorder and mom got mad I had to pay for a doctor's appointment and dad blew me off in a huff and told me that was bullshit and who told me that. So... yeah, no help at home."
knitting,ez66kbt,t3_d02p8f,1567709415.0,"Girl, if I made that, I would wear it no matter what the weather, and trust me Alabama is not fun in any heat, and carry around a few handheld fans, have my desk fan on me, etc.. As a 16 year beginner I am in awe of you! You should be so proud! Congratulations!"
auburn,ez65zx1,t1_ez53d1q,1567709275.0,"That is so kind of you! This is why Auburn people are the best! I cannot wait to start next fall for my second master's degree there! I will be online, but I will finally go to my dream school, be with my peeps, and be an alumna of the same school my Diddy went to."
