Advice,fr2mk7d,t1_fr229hg,1589839939.0,"Nothing you've described is considered abuse of children in the USA. What country do you live in? here parents are allowed to hit their children (they just can't leave marks), yell at their children (not egregiously or in a way that leaves physical damage such as yelling in their ears), and say the things to them you wrote she has said (children have been removed for verbal abuse but it has to be really bad, really foul for that to happen). At most CPS will simply tell her not to talk to them like that and 'suggest' counseling or parenting lessons, but it does not rise to the what is considered abuse so they can't make her. Parents can even let young kids play unsupervised, you may be surprised to know that many places have no set age on when children can be left home alone and/or outside, it is left up to common sense and the parents' discretion. Next time, instead of volunteering yourself to sit outside with them, simply call CPS to report very young children being left outside unsupervised. Enough of those calls, especially during an open CPS investigation on her, increases the odds she will stop doing things like that and/or CPS telling her to mind her kids outside.

At this point you can't solve the problem any other way for the kids, because in the eyes of the law there likely is no problem. Especially since though she is a single mother, she has involved parents who come help her with the kids daily. All you can do is report her to CPS. They *will* respond and open an investigation to determine if the kids are in danger.

Lastly stop expecting her to be your friend or to respond to your overtures of friendship. She doesn't owe you that and doesn't have to like you or become a part of your imagines community. Maybe she really is a sh!tty mom, but your first 3 paragraphs in your post make you seem bitter and salty AF that this young mama does not like you and rebuffed your friendship. It reads almost like if she had become your friend, none of the other stuff would even be an issue for you, hmmmmmm. 

Drop all ideas of that, report her to CPS if you genuinely feel she is abusing the kids, move to another building and get on with your life."

Not my own father, who I also love, but who treated my mother with great condescension (they are 20+ years apart in age so this was blamed on him being so much older than her) and was a typical married father (i.e. there, but not too involved in the day-to-day care and nurturance of children).

>Despite being in my early 20s, I have no plans on marrying one.

Honestly if you don't want children or don't mind raising them alone this is a wise move. The only benefit to women in regards to marriage far as I can determine is children; marriage increases the odds that the man will actually stick around and be there, raise the children with you. For whatever reason most men need that legal/religious/whatever bond with women to take fatherhood somewhat seriously, as well as continued sexual access to the mother. 

But married women live on average shorter than never-married women (while married men live longer than never-married men, humph), so if you don't want kids why would you willingly shorten your life, why take on the stress of a husband, hmmmmm"

Could you explain why this post is harmful? It is a fair question in my book. Haven't you ever wondered why it is men hate women, generally speaking?

Perhaps you think male aggression and hostility towards women is an individual matter, and should be treated as such? That is how most men I personally know view it. Most women too. In the USA where I live, for example, the men are not setting us on fire in the public square and there are no 'modesty' police or whatever they're called going around making sure women dress and act right. BUT even still many, many women are beaten and killed on a daily basis by male partners, and the domestic violence shelters stay full. So this is obviously a deeply ingrained societal issue that is sexism-based but it's seen and treated as an individual issue or relationship issue.

>Don't we all have a man in our life that we love & respect, and who respect us in turn? Fathers, friends, significant others?

Of course. I have a wonderful husband of over 20 years who treats me well. Does that mean I should no longer care about single women, who have to navigate the dating minefield to find a man who *won't* beat her, or married/partnered women currently dealing with an abusive husband?? I have a decent father, I've always had my dad and my parents are still married to this day, and my husband and I have raised two decent sons to adulthood who will make great husbands and fathers someday if they so choose. At the end of the day...so?? Why does the existence of good men mean we can't or shouldn't talk about the bad men?? Who overwhelmingly outnumber the good men?

It's like they aren't even remotely curious as to why most other men hate women and are so hard on women. They live on the same planet we do, but they pretend not to know or understand how very hard men make the lives of women, worldwide. 

It's the same song all around the world, it's just some places are better in terms of blatant hostility and physical acting-out against women. But sexism still exists everywhere, there is no place on earth that is safe for women.

The older I've gotten the more I have come to believe that it is deep, deep womb-envy. They are intensely jealous of our ability to give birth.

Mondays were the days you'd most often see kids bruised up or welted up. The teachers would just say Oh I see you were misbehaving at home or whatever. They had an obligation to report but back then it was for broken bones or black eyes, really extreme stuff

You are not going to become obese just because you extend common courtesy of social interaction with the people you live with. It's nice to talk with the folks in your household now and then.

RelationshipsOver35,fqn79bv,t3_gjqmye,1589489856.0,"Hmmmmm. Never officially separated but back when my husband and I almost divorced the state said we had to do file legal separation and either do counseling or court mediation before filing for divorce because we had minor children. We both had talked to lawyers. So we started counseling just because we had to in order to divorce, but it actually worked because we learned how to to talk and *listen* to each other, we learned how to really understand each other’s point of view. Something about having a 3rd party who was impartial really helped, as well as having to abide by her rules of office really pushed us to actually hear and acknowledge the other person’s words. 

For example she didn’t allow talking over the other person, which was something I did. She didn’t allow storming out or walking away while the other person was talking, which was something my husband did. If we tried to break any of her office rules then session immediately over, so no progress towards the divorce (and it would be even more time or a hassle to find another counselor) which is what we thought we wanted at the time. But being forced to sit there and listen helped us to finally, finally understand truly how the other felt, which was the KEY. Long story short we decided to hold off on separating, fell back in love, continued marriage counseling for about a year, and have lived happily ever since more or less. This was in 2002 and we *still* practice the communication skills we learned in marriage counseling. 

So if you two genuinely love each other you’ve got to battle through whatever the block is. One or both of you is behaving in some way that is bringing ruckus to the marriage. Whatever the issue is you’ve got to talk about it and really listen to how the other feels. To break the resentment you feel for one another, you both have to feel that the other understands and empathizes. I strongly suggest counseling."

I really don't think it's internalized misogyny though, on the part of women.

FTFY

that's pretty much all this is. A teenager is just a girl, a teenager doesn't incite their hatred like women do. They have automatic power over a girl just from being an adult, but hate women because they know, especially old men, that their 'power' over women is not only wrong but does not really prove they are superior to women like they want to believe. A female child is harmless in all ways to them but especially to their fragile self-esteem.

You'll see a similar albeit non-sexual dynamic at play in how many racists look at and interact with black children, especially boys. Anybody who has black or part-black sons, for example, can tell you that many whites will coo and fawn over their kids when they're little, particularly in places where hardly any black people live. Soon as their sons hit puberty, the coos stop and these same white people will view them with suspicion.

I think you already suspect what the truth is just based on how you initially responded to your daughter-in-law showing up with your grandkids. Of course let them in, but I'm telling you, 99% of people would immediately call *their own child* right away to ask what's going on. Especially when their child's spouse refuses to tell them what the issue is. That you let them in and then did not contact your son right away is telling. That indicates there was already something rotten in their relationship that you were previously aware of. Has he hit her before, for example? That would make the fact you didn't contact your son right away make sense. 

It makes her story seem plausible too TBH, but If I were you I would be inclined to believe him though because if what he says is true, there will be PROOF. He's young enough to know, to be technologically literate to know that deleted texts can be retrieved in most cases, so I doubt he would tell you that if it weren't true. Even if the texts can't be retrieved, call/text history  will show that she was indeed at least contacting this other man all throughout the day yesterday. 

On the other hand, if what she says is true, I feel for her because it's almost impossible for a wife to show proof of rape. It will come down to her word against his, because the proof (his sperm in her body) would be the same from consensual sex. If they were separated or she'd already left him or if they have a previous documented history of domestic violence, maybe he'll be at least charged. Convicted is doubtful 

Anyway at this point help your son find a lawyer and let the truth come to light. Be prepared either way"

The thing is it will protect much younger girls in other states with a much younger age they allow marriage, if they follow PA's examples. There is not a big difference between 17 and 18, but there is a big difference between 13 and 18.

Girls have been married as young as 11 in the USA, in modern times. Despite the fact that in all 50 states and territories the age of consent is 16. So in effect parents can take away a legal protection already in place for children and teens under 16...a parent can give permission for the rapist to marry their child.

GenderCritical,fq63nmf,t1_fq5xhs6,1589123821.0,">I don’t think men or society even think all these are required.

They do, but the standards for each point is much, much lower for men than women to begin with. Take the one on children, for example. I do believe most men think to be a good man in regards to his children means he actually loves and cares for his children. BUT - this love and care is based on his relationship with the mother, especially legal relationship. Thus many men (and society!) find it acceptable for men to disregard their children outside of a serious relationship or marriage. There are many, many men who think of themselves as 'good' even though they have children they never see and/or do not financially provide for.

Even within a marriage, to be considered a good father all that means is the man is there, he lives in the home with his kids, does not abuse the wife or kids in any way, and financially provides for the household. If he occasionally takes care of the kids on his own and/or washes a dish now and then he is considered an excellent man, and if he has married a woman with previous children (and tolerates or even loves them) then he is considered a saintly man.

As we all know the standards for women as mothers are much, much higher. Having a job does not lessen the standards, so working outside the home whether married or not means the mother is working 2 jobs. If women parented like most men do, children's services would take our kids from us."

This is a lie, because this is impossible. You could literally have another person attached to your body, you could be a conjoined twin, and still arguments and disagreements happen. So there is no way you and your wife never had angry words to say to one another at some time or another in 30 years, come on. 

When you can openly say what the issue was (and you really don't have to say to any strangers but to your wife and kids), then maybe you can reconcile with your family. Nobody on the internet knows you or cares TBH so trying to set up a perfect facade of yourself and your marriage to strangers is useless. 

Even if your goal is to campaign your wife as a villain, you need to be realistic, because no one who has been married for even a minute (or just grew up in a marriage; has married parents) will believe you two never, ever argued, to begin with. And no one with decent parents will believe that two adults with a great dad would just shut him out for NO reason. People simply don't do that...it takes a *tremendous* amount of bad parenting to make a child turn their back on their mother or father. 

Set aside the vision of perfection you have of yourself because it is not real. Be real and honest with yourself and your family about how you have conducted yourself as a husband and father these past 30 years. Once you do that you may have a chance to reconcile with your kids, but if you keep acting like you've done nothing wrong they won't have anything to do with you."

You don't have to accept this. You can choose to set boundaries on what you will and will not accept in a marriage.

It's easy enough for me to say you should leave or make declarations to him that he has to stop, but I live in the USA and am not a member of any restrictive religious community here, nor is my husband abusive in any way. For all I know you live in a different country or culture where leaving your husband means you will be killed, and even if you don't live in such a place, your husband is already verbally abusive to you.
