ptsd,ewzd9lz,t3_cqpymy,1565894368.0,Well donâ€™t do what Iâ€™ve done and wait 10 years no dating. A counselor who specializes in PTSD is an important step forward. Iâ€™ve been in counseling for a while now and the stronger I feel in my own power the easier it is to work through the resurfacing of shit. There is no perfect- just better ðŸ™‚
