help,fpt92uu,t1_fpt7l2f,1588887010.0,"Oh thank god finally. I used that as a guise to pass through Reddit's ass bot moderators. I'm having trouble with a 1800 number that keeps spam calling me. It shows up, goes away, and then calls me again all within a second. I need someone to call it because I believe that will break the cycle even though you technically can't call 1800 numbers. I can't call them myself because the number just calls me immediately. I looked for help elsewhere on the internet but apparently no one else has had this problem. I don't mean to throw this on you but I'm getting desperate. And if it starts spam calling you I swear that I will call them and figure out another way to get rid of it."

What I actually need is help with a phone number that keeps instantaneously and consecutively spam calling my phone. And I mean instantly calling me, ending the call, and then calling me again. All within a second. It's a 1800 number so I'm not sure if I can dox it or not. I need someone to call the number. You don't have to say anything and can end it right away if you want. I can't answer the phone because it's coming and going away literally(actual definition) in a second."

AskReddit,flzhz0y,t3_fs55l1,1585624123.0,"First off, fuck reddit mods. This is the 10th time I tried posting this. They kept taking down my question for the reason that it was to offensive. Initial question word for word was: ""Why do people pop pimples?"" And it got taken down because it ""was inferring that there is one way to do something."" I had to wait a collective of 2 hours and 15 minutes just to ask the question. I even came up with a creative alliteration because the initial question had 3 p words. smh my head. I'll still include the alliteration though, which was the original question I posted, but got taken down because it didn't have a question mark. Here it is:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'm powerless to possibly comprehend the impulse people possess that pushes a person to purposely pop pimples. I personally perceive it to be particularly putrid; I presume it is the product of painful and unpleasant imperfections of appearance. I implore you to please respond to my petitioned plea."

Konosuba,fhiw2or,t1_fgy4py1,1581632986.0,"I refuse to watch the sub. Not that it's bad or whatever but I just love the 4 english VAs. They have the perfect voice for the characters. This was the first anime to actually give me a  gag laugh. I'm guessing it's probably coming around April or May. Luckily, I've created a list of all the anime I've always wanted to watch but never had the time. Yu Yu Hakusho, Berserk, Cowboy BeepBoop, Initial D, Hajime no Ippo, Tokyo Ghoul, Black Clover,  Vinland Saga, and the notorious JoJo's to name a few. Yesterday I finished Mob Psycho 100 and it was amazing. At first I avoided it because I thought it looked weird, but holy Tezuka is it amazing. I realize I went off on a bit of a tangent on non Konosuba stuff. Don't lynch me for it."

SuicideWatch,f7wdc82,t1_f7tco25,1574032178.0,"Listen, I know how you feel. The world can be a cruel place and feel like there's no point. Sure, there's bad people, but the world is also full of good people. People that care for others and care for you too. I know it's hard, and I know you want to just give up, but you have to endure the pain and hold out. I know how it feels to not have friends. All of my real ones moved away and I can't make any new ones because when I try, I end up making things awkward or end up getting taken advantage of. I know how it is to not being able to speak well. It sucks. You might think people hate you because of things you did in the past, but that's not true, they don't even remember it. If you did end your life, not only would your friend be affected, but me as well. Sorry, but now that I've met you, I care about you. And I'm not just saying that, I'm serious. 11 days ago, on November 6, 4:04pm EST,  **Hollowae\_** joined reddit only to write a suicide note as her final message. I joined but was unfortunately too late. Even though I had brief information about her, it crushed me. Her words in her letter gave me an idea of the kind person she was. I still feel a crushing guilt over not being able to do anything. I want to be your friend, but that horrible feeling that you may know, makes it hard for me to express it. I'm not very good with words, so I'm sorry if this didn't help. I truly want to help you, but I can't find the words no matter how hard I try. Please don't give up."

I know how it feels to be like this. To feel like you have nothing left. I never really have anyone to talk to either. I just feel like a burden or an annoyance. I can't stand it. All the real friends I had have moved far away and I barely talk to them anymore. I try to talk to people online to but I run into the same problem of feeling like an annoyance. Even now I feel like that. But you can't give up just yet. I'll be honest, it won't get better. Not unless you do something. I don't really have a direct answer because as said before, I haven't figured it out yet. I'm also not the best with words, so I'm sorry if this doesn't help. All I can say I guess is to try and better yourself in some way. I know it's probably hard to, because of a tight schedule or something, but try to exercise. It doesn't have to be much, but it helps me. It helps me see things clearer, and a light at the end of this long tunnel. I promise you, it might seem bleak now, but someone you will meet someone who will actually listen to you and what you have to say. I'm not sure what else to say, but I hope this helps in some way. I'm really sorry if it doesn't. I just want you to know that even if it may seem shallow, or that I'm just saying whatever, I care."
