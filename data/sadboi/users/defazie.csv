insanepeoplefacebook,fq6n5ec,t1_fq4qn65,1589134743.0,"Alot of people world wide did not survive.  To blame the covid 19 on Republicans or Democrats is ridiculous.  It is something we have never gone through before in recent history.  To compare this to the swine flu is incorrect the swine flu was not as contagious.  We also had to rely on faulty information from China about the virus, and I used had for a reason this was a new virus.  Hindsight is 20/20.  This was new to everyone and many world leaders handled it the way they thought was best."

AskReddit,fpwt84t,t1_fpvlita,1588969542.0,I remember leave class one night and a young woman approached she picked me out of all of the student walking past her.  It was 900 and dark out.  She had a prosthetic leg and was using crutches.  She said she missed her bus and needed a ride to another bus stop.  All the while telling me this she kept looking past me into a parking lot.  I politely declined and she asked more instantly and was now blocking my path.  I then moved around her and caught up with a group of people going to their car.    I am a nice person and felt bad leaving her there.  But she pointed out that she was handicapped which caught me off guard and she kept looking to the parking lot that was behind me.  Not once or twice but several times.  I felt bad not helping but it just did not feel right.

whatisthisthing,fl3py7z,t1_fl371r5,1584794546.0,"Home owner insurance is about risk that is accidental or catastrophic.  

The reason why termites would not be covered is because removing pests is part of regular maintenance.  Everyone should be looking for tell tale tubes, or insect debris even in you attic.  

Maintenance would fall under a home warranty not sure if they cover it either.  

If homeowner insurance paid for catastrophic and maintenance no one would be able to afford it.  

The reason why homeowners insurance is so afford able is because the risk is spread out.  

Look at your yearly policy premium just for the homeowner and think of this if you house burned down tomorrow to the ground tomorrow.  The amount your insurance would pay for everything.  Clean up rebuild, contents, lodging.  Will always be far more than what you pay in homeowner insurance premiums for 50 years.  This can be done because everyone pools their money.  

If you start paying for maintenance the pool decreases and rates have to go up."
