‚Ä¢ universal health care is a must.

‚Ä¢ wealth redistribution is a must. CEOs that get paid millions each year will be stopped with caps. ‚Ä¢ luxury tax is a must. We expect average poor ppl to live within their means. Yet rich ppl aren‚Äôt taxed out of their asses. Luxury tax of nearly 50%. Rich ppl buy $2M yacht, 75% tax on it. 
‚Ä¢ Billionaire owners of companies will see bonuses, salary redistributed bc after all they still got billions in their accounts. Redistributed to the lowest paid workers (I.e. minimum wage worker go from $7/hr to $16/hr or more)
‚Ä¢ companies cannot pass cost by increasing their products

For me, this is my truth. Heaviest weight was 270 (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9/F), lowest was 166, now 190ish. 

Lifestyle before was struggling to lose weight, would work out, eat healthier but the weight wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere lol most I lost back then was 30 pounds without cannabis (wasn‚Äôt a big smoker than) but I would gain all that weight back faster than I took to lose it. Started to experiment with in early 20s, so as new smoker definitely gained weight bc of munchies, but once I was actually serious and mindful of my weight when high (high thoughts are brutally honest lol) I was able to commit to losing weight. 

I just went to exercise classes high, did weights high lol and smoked right after to relax my body. Started to smoke before my meals, which cut munchies out. My workout routine is the most basic lol I hate working out - ESPECIALLY ON MY OWN. Went to different aerobics classes for at 3 times a week, usually 2 hours.

I don‚Äôt want to lie and say smoking weed only made lose weight, it was only once I started smoking more smarter that I saw the weight melt. A joint before working out made the work out easier but I‚Äôm almost positive that there is a link between cannabis and weight.

What I mean by this is that anxiety that people with end of stage cancer is the same anxiety I have. The fear of dying feeling is the same throughout anxiety. 

This revelation was interesting to me because all the research I‚Äôve been doing, showed positive effects on cancer patients. So if these individuals are getting remarkably results with their anxiety off large dose psilocybin, why wouldn‚Äôt it work for me as well? After all, anxiety is anxiety. 

So now I plan on taking 2g at the end of the month, then probably start a microdosing regiment. 

What have I noticed since that small trip? 
‚Ä¢ my anxiety is bit lower, able to pay attention to it more when I‚Äôm anxious and turn it off sometimes
‚Ä¢ my confidence in myself is building. I‚Äôm starting to believe in myself and my abilities. 
‚Ä¢ increase in determination to succeed, my creativity is increasing and pushing me to pursue my ideal career that anxiety is preventing me to pursue 
‚Ä¢ tackling my credit debt more, focusing on paying of credits that I had for years!!

Overall I‚Äôm hopefully for the potential to heal."
psilocybin,fhi8w6t,t3_df4edi,1581619984.0,"Hey! Any updates? I‚Äôm curious because your post resonated with me. Basically everything you said is how i feel. Introverted. Insecure. No friends outside of family, more just acquaintances nothing solid. Feelin stuck that my anxiety, low self esteem and childhood abuse made me an unconfident adult with anxiety. Now I‚Äôm turning to psilocybin to heal. So far tried 1g in edible of psilocybin and that trip showed me my anxiety, how it felt and the ability to switch it off. But I need higher dose to properly look at my root of anxiety. 

So I‚Äôm really interested to hear from you and your journey."
PsilocybinMushrooms,fhi7g2m,t3_esm8x2,1581619181.0,Please!! Tell us your ways master lol! I‚Äôm new to psilocybin and desperately looking on how to turn them into microdose pills? Tips on how to turn to powder? How do you store them!
schizophrenia,fhi21jz,t1_fhfjple,1581616268.0,"Psilocybin and LSD and most psychedelics do work to silence the ego, other scientists than Freud identify them as the default mode network, which is the main part that ‚Äúshuts down‚Äù while psilocybin or lsd receptors are present. Studies contribute this as loss of ego that people describe. 

As for amplifying connections, as in they create neurogenesis & neuroplasticity while targeting serotonin receptors, something scientists haven‚Äôt been able to replicate in SSRIs. The science is there that they do produce stronger connections while under its influence. 

The current reality of its benefit is not skewed bc of laws and pharmaceutical greed. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt reflect the actually reality of brain works‚Äù ironic because current science doesn‚Äôt wonder why...it‚Äôs linked to older mentality that saw them as bad. This the point... why shouldn‚Äôt it be looked at as an alternative?"
Anxiety,fhi0t2e,t1_fhfsxud,1581615573.0,"How did you realize this? Putting a name to the feeling is the 1st step in coping imo. Now you have a name to what you‚Äôve been feeling, just remember that if you‚Äôre gonna die, it would‚Äôve happened by now and next thing you know it 5 minutes went by and your still alive. Very morbid I know, but that‚Äôs how I truly coped with it, knowing that feeling of death, not properly catching your breath, all that was in my head. That‚Äôs how 18 year old me handled it. That and cutting back on caffeine, makes it worse for anxiety. 

Coping is the hard part imo, especially if you don‚Äôt want to take pharmaceutical drugs that have horrible side effects."
Anxiety,fhi02yb,t1_fhfo83k,1581615160.0,"Ouch, my younger sister has anxiety when taking her orders as well. How have you been managing it?"
Anxiety,fhhzxfz,t1_fhflump,1581615072.0,"Ouff the heart palpitations are no fun! Had to decrease my caffeine to almost zero just to avoid trigger palpitations, though it helped minimize them. 

But how are you coping? Have you been able to identify your triggers or patterns?"
schizophrenia,fhfkb5a,t1_fheiw3z,1581545119.0,"No need to google whataboutism, it‚Äôs present everyday in the media life. Why should it be considered irresponsible to have discussions on natural alternatives that big pharma create synthetic versions of. You got that twisted."
schizophrenia,fhfidoc,t1_fhf07g7,1581543981.0,"How am I being ignorant from the start? Look at the discussion it‚Äôs produced, about alternatives ever considered or even researched into. 

If any ignorance yours towards natural alternatives and the possibilities they offer."
schizophrenia,fhfhp0k,t1_fhej97b,1581543584.0,Shutting down as quieting the active ego part of the brain that we use constantly and amplifying connections with other parts of the brain. Doesn‚Äôt alcohol suppress parts of the brain? Where as psilocybin creates new neuron
schizophrenia,fhfh4mq,t1_fhd0of8,1581543266.0,"I‚Äôve been reading into psilocybin as well, especially with them working same was as antidepressants but without the dulling side effects. That and neuroplasticity capability that psychedelics they pose and why haven‚Äôt they continue studies as they did in 50s? Big pharma suppresses this bc not of laws but bc you can‚Äôt patent nature. Only synthetic versions of them. 

What if the cure to most mental illness is in natural psychedelics... or even at least explore this possibility if it helps with anxiety in people dying... why wouldn‚Äôt it help with everyone else dealing with anxiety? After all anxiety IS anxiety, regardless of you have stage 4 cancer."
schizophrenia,fheez0z,t1_fhco85k,1581520948.0,May I ask how it helps you? The other half unfortunately have reefer madness views on nature‚Äôs remedies.
schizophrenia,fheela6,t1_fhbuhr4,1581520703.0,"It‚Äôs not a bogus statement, especially when you do your research into how SSRIs target serotonin receptors, pharmaceuticals drugs try to replicate what‚Äôs found in nature. You should look into that more, you‚Äôd be surprised the similarities between their goals. 

Not recruiting anyone, just starting discussions into pharma vs natural. True psychiatric medications currently available are because of government blocking since into natural alternatives. We now know the war on drug and class 1 scheduling is scientifically and morally wrong. That‚Äôs the discussion I‚Äôm interested in starting."
