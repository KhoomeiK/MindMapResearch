Regardless of the money, I’m glad your partner is supporting you for now. Let them know you don’t want to stay this way forever and that you appreciate their support and effort. I didn’t say this often enough and my guy got sick of me never making enough to contribute to anything substantial. 

It’s tough out there but you can make it."
depression,fr0vppo,t3_exo6f1,1589807848.0,"In February I met a great guy (24M). Three years younger than me (27F), super supportive with my career choices, into the same things as me, great with my dog, likes to cook. Come March, he gets fired from his job and his lease was ending. Because of quarantine it was impossible to find a new place at the time, especially considering he had only enough savings to pay for a shared room at the time. So, I offered for him to move in with me in my small 1BR apartment where he could pay half the rent and split groceries, which would be exactly his budget). We said we’d make music every day and split chores. Come late April, he moves in. It’s been a while now and we haven’t done much of what we said we would. It’s the first time he’s lived with a girl and only his second year living away from his parents. I’m starting to realize he’s really just way too inexperienced in this regard and it’s been making me miss my ex of seven years who was great when it came to chores and dealing with my bad moods (although not great in many other ways). The other day I had a beach ache, so I opened up my box of medicines. A box of antidepressants fell out and new bf asks me what those are. I tell him those are my antidepressants that I haven’t taken since October. “You’re depressed?” 

That question just sort of hit me. Maybe that’s why I’m feeling so dissatisfied and tired lately. Maybe that’s why I don’t seem to feel much for him or anyone lately. “Yeah, I have depression and anxiety. I’ve told you this before,” I said. But he’s young and sheltered and literally has no clue that depression isn’t always caused by any one event or reason. He doesn’t get it that sometimes I’m just anxious. I’m struggling to smile lately and him asking me this question just really threw me. 

The real answer is “yeah. I’m depressed and I don’t know why. I miss my ex and I wish you were more mature. No, you can’t help me.” Sigh. Doesn’t help that one of my band mates recently hit on me + made unwanted physical contact with me in my car before declaring his interest in me even though he knows exactly my romantic situation.  Wtf??? Ugh I’m just exhausted."

Friendships have been ruined because the other party simply couldn’t stop fantasizing about me. For example, I had a close friend with whom I’d talk for hours over the phone or go to lunch with... I kept asking if it would make his wife upset, and he kept saying no. Until he wrote a play about me and asked me to play myself in it. The script made me out to be some kind of man eating floosy. It made me super uncomfortable when I went to watch it, especially thinking anyone in the audience (many of my friends/acquaintances) might guess it’s based on me.

Not violently, but bit by bit he would do little touches or sit real close... eventually things got weird and I froze up when the actual event was happening. I tend to just sort of... let these things happen ever since. Maybe I really do need some kind of coach to teach me that saying no is ok and how to do it properly and effectively. In some situations I’ve said no and the guy did not back off... maybe that’s why I feel like it doesn’t work? Idk. The guy who touched me yesterday made me give him a straight answer when he later made his intentions clear. Thing is, we see each other all the time (work), so now the awkwardness is unavoidable."
tifu,fqwf9f4,t1_fqw3ozu,1589702325.0,"Yeah. I should really just not meet anyone like that. Especially not in that type of setting, where there aren’t many escape routes. I’m a bit socially awkward or socially submissive, so I didn’t feel like there was any one thing I could get vocal about at the time. Also because of the setting. What if I made him mad and that would trigger violent behavior? I’d be stuck in a locked house with him. What if I freaked out after the hug in the parking lot? It’s the suburbs, people disappear in places like that all the time... I could just hear My Favorite Murder podcast blasting in my brain the whole time, “stay sexy, don’t get murdered.”"
