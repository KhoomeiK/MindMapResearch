ptsd,fqs7329,t3_gk595q,1589600001.0,"Hey, my experience isn't the same but very similar. 

When I was 10, I had a major surgery, which I woke up in the middle of. I'm not sure for how long, but I felt the pain and couldn't scream right away.  As a result,  I ended up with major sleep disturbances for a year or two and regularly occurring nightmares for awhile after that. At my worst I was up all hours of the night,  every time I fell asleep I'd see it again. It got to the point where most of my sleep happened during the day, because it felt safer. Eventually things calmed down,  but it still messes with me sometimes,  even 11 1/2 years later. 

My advice is to get as much help as you can as soon as you can! I didn't have the best family circumstances,  so I didn't have the option to get help for any of my trauma until very recently and I morn all those lost years. Please take care of yourself,  OP!!

(I did this when I became aware of my issues as a teen. ) I didn't want attention so much,  I just wanted to understand myself and I wish people understood me.


I had all kinds of theories on why I was messed up, and therapy didn't become an option until much later. I had no idea what was happening to me as a kid and I still question whether or not my trauma is ""real"" or ""valid"" daily. I'm also still trying to get out of the situation that caused a lot of my trauma. 

Now I'm in therapy and I'm starting to understand my trauma (a combination of complex trauma and several 1-off events) and its impact on my life. 

I have very little support irl but I'm gaining allies. I often wonder what could have been for me, had I run into less judgment and more support.  It's hard but I hope it gets easier soon.

""We can't accommodate people in chairs."" In fact, I'm still trapped in my situation right now. People see a chair, not a person. I have no help.  People make excuses for the abuse because ""having a disabled child is haaaaard."" They could have just put you in a home!! Be grateful"" just to name a few examples.""  The whole system is always biased towards the caregiver and so are a lot of people. My words and experiences don't meah shit. Abuse of the disabled is NEVER talked about. 

Add that to the employment discrimination I've been dealing with because I'm disabled and places don't want to hire cripples. The ones that do don't give you a fair shot.  So I can't get myself out of here the way many orher people get to. Oh and I still have to rely on Nparents to take me to my bus stop, and I'm still taking a bus in the first place because they make it  more expensive and much more difficult for people like me to get licenses. Because,  why do we need independence or quality of life? Do disabled people deserve to live at all?  

My only hope right now that things lift enough soom for my SSI application to go through,  and my abusers don't find out.  Even if that works,  I then have to hope that I don't end up on a housing waitlist for a year or more to and I can get a place that's even semi accessible.  Or by some miracle I can get a full-time remote job that gives me good benefits or things open enough soon enough for me to go on the Workability healthcare program so I can work full time and not die because I can't afford life sustaining meds. Then I have housing accessiblity to think about and whether or not a landlord would want to rent to a cripple. 

As you can see. I'm in quite the impossible situation myself because I have no help and few allies in my life. COVID 19 raised the stakes for me even more. I don't know if I'll ever get out now. Things feel impossible. I've been trying to get out I'm praying to a god that I'm not sure  I believe in because I'm fucking desperate. 

You know what I don't do? Automatically assume all abled people have it better just because their bodies function the way they're supposed to!  Do a lot of them have different challenges than I do or maybe have less? Sure, but some of them have more and I can't assume either way.

You can't just assume that everyone in any given group always has it better than you.  Men and women deal with different stigma and stereotypes, but it doesn't mean one has it better or that the one gender can't still face a problem that's more common to the other.

  This little pissing contest that some people insist on having doesn't change the fact that everyone's abuse is different and some have more support than others.    It also doesn't change the fact but most people can't get help from the places set up to help them or the fact that society is painfully ignorant of the many forns abuse can take.  You're not helping anyone by calling everyone else priviledged, you're hurting them and you're hurting yourself.

   Why is it that  people either laugh at it or ignore it? Everyone hates abuse and abusers until they see it on TV or find out that their upstanding churchgoing neighbors might actually be abusing their kids. Abuse isn't a ""serious"" matter until it's impossible to hide, and sometimes not even then.

I'm sorry. This fires me up. A lot of my trauma that lead to PTSD comes from living as a scapegoat of the narc family.  I still live with them and I'm quarantined here.

Our image was always perfect.  I was the disabled burden child born to a saintly sufferer NMom and I'd have hell to pay if I didn't say and do exactly what's expected. Coached responses to people asking ""how are you?"" Threats of all kinds, mom joining the PTA because ""I'll know everything you say and do."" Everything had to be perfect.  Meanwhile,  emotional abuse,  was common, there are a lot of things that would probably count as physical abuse (denying me mobility aides, forcing me to go without certain meds or forcing those meds when I didn't want them and some other stuff .) Other types of abuse that weren't perpetrated by them but allowed by them.  There's a lot more I could say but I'm trying to limit it to just enough to give you a slight understanding.

Not all of this has stopped either,  a lot hasn't,  but it doesn't look exactly like those dramatic portrayals of abuse and I'm not able bodied,  so I don't count. 
It makes me fucking sick to know how hypocritical and backwards we are as a society regarding abuse issues in 2020! There are probably people who would laugh if you pointed a camera at me and put it to the right music on TV. Not all abuse is perpetrated by Billy the Obvious wife beater or Sherry the obvious crackhead mom. Abuse is way more common than people wanna think but they'd rather laugh or pretend it's not there because it isn't happening to them.
