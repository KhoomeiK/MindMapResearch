3. At least in Germany you have to pay taxes for owning property and that sure has a different name then lending cost but one part of those taxes that you pay certainly is exactly that. And even if you don't pay taxes for owning property, at the end of the day the land belongs to the government owning it and if it makes a rule that now on your property this and that is not allowed, or it needs to be turned into a forest then that will happen, they might give you land somewhere else but you would need to accept that because you never truly bought the land"

JordanPeterson,fpclggq,t3_gcnx6q,1588504966.0,Capitalism is a system that creates and promotes monopolies because those make the most profit. They obviously are bad because if it is a monopoly of something you can't live without (a capitalist owning all water resources in the are as an example) a bad hierarchy is created. The even worse example is when land is owned. Some say capitalism without a government would be better but a landlord taking rent from people is very similar to the state taking taxes. It is also about the relationship of workers and owners to the means of production. Some argue the workers should always own them but in capitalism that doesn't have to be the case. How trade occurs can have many effect on other aspects
