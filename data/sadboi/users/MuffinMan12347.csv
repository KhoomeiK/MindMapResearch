I've had 'habits' as I use to call them since as long as I can remember and never understood why. Ranging from moving my eyes, making noises, popping my ears, honestly I couldn't list them all as over my lifetime I've had well over 20+ different tics. Only 2 years ago when I was 21 and brought this up with a doctor he suggested I most likely have TS which I wasn't too aware of and so a lot of people knew it as mostly swearing as thats how it was portrayed. I've done a lot more research on it since then and have mostly come to terms with it over my life. My parents still don't completely understand, but thats just due to the lack of education about it all.

I'm rambling, but again, thank you for posting this. The more information we can get out there about it especially at an early age would have helped me immensely in my past. So I really hope it can help the others out there."

As I mentioned before a lot has to do with muscle memory for me. I worked out pretty shitly from 14-17. Started working out properly around 18 for 9 months.

AskReddit,fp8q6ps,t3_gbzdtd,1588399427.0,I was 12 when the movie Click came out staring Adam Sandler. My brother downloaded a horrible quality version from limewire on my mum’s computer and we watched it together. One of the final scenes just made me start to cry and it felt so weird as not other show or movie had done that to me before. It was the only movie/show to make me cry until I turned around 20.

This does not mean that every single weekend out with the boys drinking is a special occasion though."
