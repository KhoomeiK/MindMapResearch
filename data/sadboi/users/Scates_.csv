mentalhealth,fpealgl,t3_gcdan4,1588543683.0,I go through the exact same thing when I hit a heavy depressive episode so I know exactly what you mean. I honestly think that separating yourself from people when you need to is totally fine but that doesn’t mean ghost them. If you’re gonna separate yourself from people you’re close with at least let them know what’s going on and tell them that you need time for yourself. You’d be surprised at how sympathetic and understanding people can be in situations like these.

Because I was maybe 12 years old at the time and I played my first ever playthrough of Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness (which is my fav game in the franchise) I used Espeon as my ace and it absolutely tore through everything, much deserving of my fav Pokémon spot.

mentalhealth,fbwlhpz,t1_fbwjuzs,1577153069.0,"There are a lot of things that contribute to my depression but I think the biggest would be that I’m 23 years old and and don’t seem to have much direction in my life right now. I do have goals that I want to achieve, it’s just figuring out how to get there is what makes me feel overwhelmed. I’ve tried multiple times to figure out a plan for success in the past 5 years since I graduated high school and have failed repeatedly. I know that it’s pretty normal to be stuck in my position at my age but having tried a plan for success 4 or 5 times only to fail and be stuck right back where I was at the start is pretty demotivating. I’ll be honest, I sometimes get the feeling like I’ll never reach my goals in life and that’s where my depression stems from."
mentalhealth,fbwafsg,t1_fbw91ob,1577144783.0,"I’ll be honest, I’ve never really interpreted medication that way before. It definitely makes sense. I’ll be honest I am afraid of any possible side affects of certain medication but what really terrifies me is the thought of being on meds for a while, then coming off them, and then slipping back into an even deeper depression which my doctor has told me is definitely a possibility. Regardless, this was really helpful, so thank you."

The feeling of hopelessness. Nobody truly wants to harm or kill themselves but nobody wants to live with a severe mental illness, and unfortunately for some people that’s the only option they feel they have to find relief."
