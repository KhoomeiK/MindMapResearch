If you can say, ""You are not welcome to speak to me to me this way."" before you leave, that's great, but if you can't get anything out, just walking away and not engaging is absolutely okay and says more about your composure and professionalism than her lack of it."

Next step?
Get a multi vitamin. Email your doctor for a good recommendation or go to the drugstore and ask the pharmacist for help. They will be able to help you choose the right one and make sure it won't interact with any prescriptiond you may be on."
Assistance,fi7ri1n,t3_f6ppie,1582226830.0,"I am in a very similar situation. Honestly, walking has helped immensely. Sometimes I get panic attacks and randomly walk 12 miles home and...feel better. It's taken the extra weight off but I still am binge watching TV, bringing snacks, smoking, drinking, doing absolutely nothing to improve anything bc I feel debilitated in my sadness. Exhausted that I've been turned away by 14 therapists who are too busy. Losing my state assistance bc I didn't get their prescribed treatment because no doctor could get me in. I feel like everyone in a position to help doesn't give a f*** and is just collecting a paycheck.

My last resort is support groups. Everyone I tried to go to got canceled. I just got laid off from a job which made my depression worse, but on the bright side, the shift was during the only support group that wasn't being canceled, so now I get to go to that.

Look for your silver linings. I lost my job, I don't know how I'm going to come up with $3k by next week, but I get to finally get some counseling and support.

Many churches and community centers have them for free. Many of them may even have members on Reddit who would go with you. I approached a random coworker who mentioned her depression once, and we don't know each other well but we are holding each other accountable to get to this group in two weeks so we can finally take more control over our mental health than waiting for doctors to turn us down.

I also have three happy lamps that mimic sunlight which help. They're $100 online but I found them all at Goodwill for less than 10.

Also, a multi vitamin. When I'm depressed I eat like shit. Missing vitamin B and D will make me irritable, sad, foggy minded, unable to focus, unable to sort through my thoughts. I'm too sad to eat nutritiously and make sure my body is getting everything it needs. A multi vitamin makes an incredible difference in my ability to think clearly and get out of the worst funks because it fulfills the bodily needs I'm not eating. It's such a small thing to put into your day that I wish I did years before."
Assistance,fi7q4cc,t3_f6oim1,1582226096.0,"I would brace it. It sounds like it isn't stable enough on its own for normal activities, so it stands to reason putting a new load on it that it isn't used to will further risk the stability- your knee isn't strong enough to support the activity you're going for. Brace it and see your doctor ASAP before it gets worse if you want to continue this activity. How are you quads? Did you go through any strengthening exercises there in physical therapy?"

He may be able to sue separately for restitution due to loss of parent/partner, or they may make an arrangement of a financial sum before the termination, but once they both agree to termination she has no obligation to pay any money because she is no longer that baby's parent. 

You need to sort out the financial aspects before the termination if you want any support from her."
