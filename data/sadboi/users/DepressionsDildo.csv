The son seemed fine and wasnt depressed or anything that they could tell, but his 13th birthday (God this poor kid was only 12) was coming up. He was going to get this controller for the game (I think the dad said Fortnite?) After the kid was found, the dad discovered he had smashed his computer monitor a second time due to anger at the game. It just all spiraled was the dad's theory, the kid was upset that he couldn't see his friends and have a birthday party (especially for 13!) And he made a mistake. Awful.

This is what is needed right now. We need more people like these kids who did this for a random kid online. Wholesome AF."

I love how open he is about suffering from depression and going to therapy, I think that really resonates with a lot of his fans.

I DO think he should chill a bit on Twitter, which he seems to be at the moment. He needs to realize there will always be haters, but the fan love far outweighs the hate.

My opinion of him is that he is a genuinely tormented and talented guy with a big, goofy personality and maaaaaybe lacking a bit in impulse control.

Nothing but love, though. I'm like his biggest fan. In 2016 at my old job my coworkers gave me a birthday card with his face on it because I always talked about him, and then for my 30th last year two of my friends paid for a thirty or so second video (I forgot the name of the platform) so yeah everyone knows I FUCKING LOVE RONNIE."

Anyway, mine is kind of small. I had a ring my high school boyfriend gave me that was too big for my finger. Still, I wore it constantly. I was on my bed on the phone, gesturing wildly and the ring flew off my finger. I heard it hit the wall. I had a metric shit ton of plushies next to my bed at the time, it was literally like a sea. I immediately cried, hung up with my friend and started to search. I didnt find it.

Three days later, after tearing the sheets off my bed and putting them back on, having thrown all my animals out of that area and going over it with a fine toothed comb, it was gone. I'd been praying to Saint Anthony to help me find it. So on the third day, I woke up and I felt something hit my bum. I stood up and there it was, in the bed. It literally couldn't have been there. I ripped the sheets off.

Anyway, IDK if it really counts but I know that ring was NOT in my bed. It didnt bounce off the wall, it just tapped the wall and fell into the plush pool."

Just the other night, I dreamt that there were killer clowns that like slept or hid by hiding inside kids' brains. Later that night I dreamt my Godfather (whom I havent spoken to in years and is old) got a new Bernese Mountain Dog puppy and named him Bernie. In the dream, I kept calling the puppy Bernie Sanders and my godfather got pissed because he wasnt a Bernie supporter (IDK if he is IRL).

casualiama,fkn5ct7,t1_fkmuism,1584354188.0,"I am not OP but I used to deal cards at a casino here in PA.

Baccarat has the best odds in the house. You will never understand WHY the rules of the game are the way they are, but learn em anyway. If you bet on the Banker hand and win, you owe 10% commission which is kept track of on the table. If you win a Player hand, that's all yours baby! But the bank has something like 51% chance of winning.

My personal recommendation to people, though, is Roulette. Why? I knew plenty of experienced Roulette dealers who could spin certain numbers. I cant say if it was a fluke or not, but they get a realllyyyyy good feel for how hard to spin that wheel when they want a certain result. How do you get them to want to spin your number? Throw up a dollar bet for them in the upper corner of your bet. If they hit your number they just got a $36 tip which is pretty fuckin awesome."
