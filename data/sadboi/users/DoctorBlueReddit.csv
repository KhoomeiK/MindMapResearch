Pwbpd- person with bipolar disorder right? 
Do you have the disorder or was it your partner, if it was your partner did they always 

Coda- support groups for co dependants? 
I'm not sure if she is, it's possible I guess but she's never mentioned anything like this. But looking through some info there Is a slight chance I may be. I wouldnt say I'm in denial as I'm willing to explore that path. Nor do I need control, I like control but I have put myself in many situations where I dont have any. 

Something I'll look into a bit more I guess.

Okay guys so little update, another weekend passed and she drank again, I didn't join her though. She had maybe 6 or 7 beers and left the rest in the fridge, didn't touch them yesterday or today and just left for work. 

I did have a little moan and encouraged her not to drink, which didn't seem to piss her off at all, what did touch a nerve though was when I pointed out she's already had 5 beers. Counting a big no no? 

The sex has calmed down a bit. We have had both rough and passionate sex but as I struggle to finish most times we just layed together and she used a toy whilst I used my oh so experienced hand xD 

Last night was the first night we didn't have sex whilst together. We just layed there and cuddled. 

I can be insecure at times so at first I assumed she was going off me. I didn't tell her this as I know I overthink everything and something's are better left in my head. But anyway she has said we'll get groovy tonight so I'm putting it at the back of my mind. 

She has to take b12 injections as her body will no longer store it so her energy levels suffer at times. I convinced her to go out and play some crazy golf with myself and her kid, we all enjoyed it but I had to really persuade her. 

Obviously doing life is important for her and her kid but am I doing harm dragging her out of bed? B12 injections can take about 48 hrs to work and this was 24 hrs after. 

Also I found the bottle of whisky, she hasn't touched it but I dont want to keep the temptation. How can I approach it? If it just goes missing she'll question me so if I do I'd want to be up front about it. 

Lastly... I haven't seen any sort of mood swings, I'm expecting some sort of imbalance or frustration at times but she has never got angry with me. Should I keep expecting it or isn't that associated with drinking problems?

AskReddit,fi05234,t3_f5qmky,1582026665.0,"I once was on holiday and on the second day one of the male staff decided to spend his day showing us his martial arts moves. He was pretty good, he'd do stuff like 3 flips and a kick, it was pretty cool to watch but he literally done this for like 5-6 hours and was so obnoxious about it you just didn't want to tell him for the 30th time, he would ask what we thought after eacu flip too. 

Anyway by the end of the day he was still being cocky and started boasting about how great he was at bowling. I then swiftly proceeded out of impulse and impatience to mention I also used to be a bowling champion in my area, if I'm honest I dont even think we have a league down here. Eventually the day ended I smoked some weed and went to bed. 

The next day the tool, the boss and this stunning blonde staff member all walked towards me smiling, the boss proceeded to reaffirm my comments and had me confirm them. Once confirmed (like a dick) she then informed me she has booked us all into a night of bowling for our last night, just under 2 weeks from now. 

I was reminded of this little play date a couple times throughout the day by multiple people for the rest of the holiday, luckily no one really knows anything about bowling or techniques so no one asked about the details of my skill level and the tool had no interest in getting to know me. But I was in to deep and couldn't blow my cover, I was just hoping it got cancelled or I died or something. But nope, I survived and the day came, we all went to enjoy our last day at the bowling centre. It was almost immediately he started to spot something was fishy, so kudos to him for that, but by then it was to late, the game had started and the challenge was on. He won, I came like 19th or something stupid but it was 2nd from last. 

After a few throws people knew I was trash and took the piss which was nice because everytime someone did he would kind of mumble to himself, I think he wanted to beat a pro so was dissatisfied with the skill levels he was facing. 

I didn't see him the next morning as we were all leaving, I can only imagine he was still at the bowling place looking for a worthy competitor, I hope he is still there now. Searching, yearning to find someone as douchy as himself."
