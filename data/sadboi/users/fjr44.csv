Chiropractic,fgm707v,t3_ez7r7n,1580919150.0,"With all due respect, I’d simply avoid posting things like u did on Reddit. 

I come from 4 generations of MD’s ( one of which is an ortho surgeon). 

Bottom line is medicine is a 3.4 trillion $ industry. 
Big business to say the least. 

MD’s simply cannot make it in solo practice for a myriad of reasons- the most common is the cost of medical malpractice for medicine; being mindful medical errors are the 3rd leading cause of death in the US. 

Chiros pay very little for malpractice ins for the simple reason they do not injure ppl.  
Also, chiros need to also be entrepreneurs, and typically go into solo practice. 
Something MD’s simply can’t accomplish. 

I have many stories of family members exhausting all things medical/medicine, to finally get well by using chiropractic. 

I believe it’s purely based on $, and not what ppl spout about chiros not being evidence-based. 
- just imagine if chiropractic was the 3rd leading cause of death in the US!!

I’m passionate about this as I’ve had family members respond amazingly to chiropractic, after years of being drugged, and still in pain. 

MD’s should be used for crisis care IMO. 

I’ve seen too many ppl go down a bad path w medical doctors, and they don’t see anything wrong w it, as medicine is the only way to go in their thought process. 
I don’t see posts about how “bull**it medical care is in the US. 
 - a pill for every ill, and if it doesn’t work, try another pill. And the cycle continues. 

I wish I’d bc a chiro, as I’ve seen the miraculous results it had on my parents, after suffering for years w MD’s bf relenting to go to a chiro. 

I was somewhat “pushed” into engineering by my family years ago, as most of my extended family is in medicine.

I went to countless seminars. 
I visited many successful DC’s in the SE region. 
I joined many adjusting clubs in school.

The workloads in the diff schools are somewhat similar - to the best of my knowledge.

Chiropractic,fefdjux,t3_eosj23,1579054013.0,"After years of sporting injuries, I began to develop back pain, and pain into my buttocks. 
I had a few images done by a doc in an ortho group. 

It was determined I had a degenerative disc that caused the joint to be unstable. 

Surgery was recommended. 

At 32 yrs of age, my parents were reluctant, so they sent me to a spinal surgeon who concurred. 

We took the images to a chiropractor for a third opinion. 
The DC indicated flexion/extension views weren’t taken to determine stability/instability. 
She ref’d us for more radiographs. 

It turned out my “unstable joint” was actually just fine. 
DJD didn’t correlate to pain according to the DC. 

My parents were very perplexed, and brought me to a neurologist. 
The neurologist recommended treating w the DC, as he believed drug therapy would cause more harm than good. 

Within two weeks, I was pain free, and the pain hasn’t returned.

Therefore, they either drop out, or they graduate, and never actually make it a career. 

I believe it’s a phenomenal profession, yet challenging for many to make a living out of it. 

Just think how many MD’s, or PT’s are in private practice. 
MD’s can’t open private practices - the malpractice they have to pay alone is overwhelming.

I’m not certain about the specifics of scope of practice in Canada. 
However, in the states,  ppl need referrals from either a DC, or an MD to be seen by a PT. 
(possibly some states differ on this, and it prob. has to do w ins. pts. - not exactly certain; can only use my state as an example). 

Prior to going to college (undergrad), I worked three months for a DC, and three months for a PT facility. 
Obviously, it was my subjective experience, yet the PT’s were bombarded w report writing, and continually had to ask for more visits, as well as consistently mrkt themselves to MD’s / DC’s. 
It seemed like glorified massage, and a personal trainer roled up in one. 
Moreover, many of the therapists openly told me they wouldn’t go through PT school to work the hours they worked, and receive the compensation they rec’d - both financially, and openly from patient satisfaction. 
I’ve also never met a PT who had their own business. 

The chiropractor I worked for had a cash practice, ( I don’t), and the environment was polar opposite - such ease, and incredibly happy ppl / pts.  
The beauty of chiropractic is you don’t need to get caught up in the jargon/philosophies/politics at all. 
I opened up directly out of chiro school, and 22 yrs. later, the profession has been phenomenal to me, and my patients. 
I never tried to “prove” anything to anyone, and I didn’t espouse chiro. healed everything. 
 - albeit, I did / do witness many miraculous occurrences from adjustments. 
I find most ppl subscribe to the notion the body heals itself; most ppl are aware the 3rd leading cause of death is medical errors.

I cut Kratom out of my diet, and that’s been great for me in all aspects. 

I’ve been taking high doses of Inositol @ 20+ grams a day.  There are many studies on the benefits of it w anxiety & depression, however, one drawback is significant diarrhea. I looked closer at the literature, and found out it’s normal w high amounts of Inositol. Your body acclimates to the high dose. I was fine after 7-10 days. 

I also began L-Theanine @ 2x/day (400mg). 

I’ve only dosed 2x w Phenibut. I didn’t notice anything w it.

GAD is very low, and most times not there at all. 
Very promising, yet placebo effects may also be at work. 

One thing I’ve begun to understand by reading all of the posts on Reddit, and in reading materials on anxiety in general, is that we all respond differently to these supplements/vitamins/meds. 
It seems best to try one thing for 14-30 days bf making a judgement. I cannot speak w any certainty on anything just yet. 

Side note: I’ve also began distance running this past April, and that’s been phenomenal for certain!!
Also, I asked my pcp for a prescription for Modafinil. I attribute that to helping me a lot. 
You need to use lateral thinking w it, as it’s a stimulant/nootropic, and used for narcolepsy. 
Typically, the opposite of what you’d give to someone w anxiety. 
It helps me bc I attribute panic/intense anxiety episodes to overthinking. I believe Modafinil helps bc it allows me to focus intensely on one thing. Therefore, I use my mind for my benefit- not stressing about the past, or using my imagination to worry about the future. I believe it helps me be much more present.

I would dose, and completely zone out. 
I liken it to oxycodone - I can’t tell the difference. 
I made excuses to miss work, miss my daughter’s  sporting events, so I could take my Kratom, and go sit in the proverbial corner, and nod out. 
Couldn’t think clearly on it, and def couldn’t do anything athletic on it. Made poor decisions on it that impacted those around me.

I was hooked w in a week, always looking forward to my first Kratom dose in the morning. Completely numbed me, placing me in a euphoric state for hours. Great initially, yet fully addicted.

I didn’t notice anything at all. I dosed twice a week. I went up incrementally, stopping at 2g. I never had a response- positive, or negative.

BTW, we cannot share vendor info on Reddit.

I also tried Kratom, and had phenomenal results.

Never knew what it was, as it wasn’t spoken about much 30+ years ago. Modafinil keeps me awake, and able to focus. However, when dealing w anxiety/ panic/ depression, being awake isn’t something that translates to function. Look into exercise firstly - you’ll be amazed how good a walk for 10-15 minutes feels. Also, consider taking high doses of Inositol/B8. You’ll need 18g’s or more, yet the studies on it are amazing! It lifts depression & anxiety incredibly !  Also, look into Phenibut-helps greatly w anxiety, and all that surrounds it. These are non-medical ways of dealing w it. I also began on xanax at very small doses for the panic. I know xanax carries a negative connotation w it, yet it was needed for me to stop panic attacks. Once panic was under control, I could then address all of my other issues, and get off medications. Best of luck!! Ask anything at all - I believe talking about it is best, as I hid it for decades; I was “ashamed” of it. You’re doing a great thing for yourself simply by reaching out."

phenibut,f0vh0k2,t3_d6oy4a,1568981362.0,"Tried both for GAD only - neither was for recreational use. 

Kratom = high / euphoric/ no pain / complete relaxation / couldn’t function at all - felt numb, warm, tingly all over, and def could not function socially / physically/ mentally; just vegged and rode the buzz ( at least for me - every single time; red strain @ 5g). 

Phenibut = overly talkative / somewhat calm/  focused /  overall sensation was very muted / can function on it perfectly fine ( this is again just my experience @ 2g). 

Continuing w Phenibut - still waiting for the effects to last 36 hours!!! May have to increase dose. I’ve taken it on an empty stomach, & also waited an additional two hours after taking it bf I ate. 

Discontinuing Kratom - I began craving that high, and taking incrementally more when I didn’t get the buzz I was chasing after 20 minutes of ingesting it. I’m glad it helps so many. This is a powerful plant."

Quick question- I’ve taken it in capsule form (750mg), and didn’t notice anything. 
10 days later I took 1g of powder form. 
It was taken both times on an empty stomach, and I waited 4 hours after ingestion to ingest. 
The second dose was roughly 14 days after the first time I tried it. 
It’s now 15 hours after the second time I tried it, and I didn’t noticed anything at all. 
Only issue that may be hindering any efficacy is the fact I had Kratom in my system, and evidently it takes 7 days for Kratom to clear out of one’s system. However, I haven’t read anything about other substances affecting Phenibut. 
Any insight you may have would be greatly appreciated.

phenibut,f0qhmft,t3_d62cun,1568860002.0,"Why would one stop if it continues to work well?
Also, what dosage would you suggest someone new to Phenibut to take initially?

I initially purchased it at a vitamin shop. 
Simultaneously, i was reading a lot about Kratom, as I was going to try both of these for GAD.  (I usually give a new supplement 20-30 days bf passing judgment). I was gonna try Phenibut firstly. I was highly motivated to start Phenibut, as the reviews were phenomenal-only bad consensus was withdrawal ( which I still don’t understand, bc if it works, why are u stopping it??). 

Anyway, I made the mistake of taking 3g. 
I literally opened the container in my car, and ingested 12 capsules w out water. I had an empty stomach, and it was early in the afternoon, so I gave it a shot. ( I have no issues at all swallowing pills!)

It wasn’t until I got home, and read notes I had on a post it note in my kitchen, that I began to panic. 
I used the suggested starting dose for Kratom. 

I decided to ride it out, as I wasn’t sick/nauseous-I felt fine. Eleven hours later I went to bed w the thought this stuff doesn’t work. I had no reaction whatsoever. 

A few days later, a YT video for Phenibut was recommended (prob bc I read/watch a lot about nootropics). It was yet again someone raving about Phenibut. 
So I ordered the powder form online this time, and decided to give it another try. 

I waited a few weeks, and my plan is to wake up at 6am, toss & wash, then wait till 10am bf eating anything. My understanding is this is best route to take to determine if it works. 
I plan on taking 1g (1/2 teaspoon - awaiting scale in mail). 
My hope is I have an effect that’s even mildly close to the effects it has on some ppl."
modafinil,f0qedte,t3_d634pk,1568858442.0,"I would’ve enjoyed it if someone gave it to me w out knowing what it was supposed to do, and after a week asked me what I noticed about the week!

I’ve been on anxiolytic meds for 18 years. I’m a very anxious person, who has/had full blown panic attacks a few times a month. 
I’ve never had coffee bf (odd huh!), and I avoid caffeine at all costs. 

So w regards to Modafinil, I took it using lateral thinking. My pcp gave me a script for it, hesitantly,  based upon my history. I was of the thought if I could get my mind to focus ( not think about the past, or use my imagination to worry about the future), possibly I could lower my anxiety, and reduce meds. 

Firstly, it didn’t affect my anxiousness/nervousness whatsoever. I actually had a semblance of background calmness. This was very unique for me, and def welcomed. 
I was not amped up at all (100mg), and slept well each night.
I’ve noticed how very alert I was - to all visual/auditory stimuli. I would describe it as someone w poor vision putting on glasses for the first time. 
I didn’t notice colors as more vibrant, and sounds as more crisp, like some testimonials suggest, however, I did get a sense of being overall more focused - Not necessarily on a particular task, simply just not  forgetting trivial things, and I didn’t have to “search” for the perfect word. My brain just spit out what I asked of it. 

I’m def a proponent of it. It may be a placebo effect, yet I’m considering using it daily. There are some good PubMed studies on it that are encouraging."

Best wishes for those trying to get off of it, or for those trying to quit anything for that matter. Conversely, I’m glad this plant helps so many ppl, and happy the AKA has helped so many States keep it legal.

Reason I’m attempting Phenibut, is bc I have this background GAD all day, and no meds helped. A variety of non-med treatments didn’t help either. Best of luck!!

phenibut,f0p8029,t3_d5njah,1568829161.0,"Looking back, I initially went to a large group practice that  pretty much had a lions share of the market in the city where I lived. They started me on  .5mg of xanax, and over a year, I built up to 3mg. I left the group practice  when I became a cash payor, and found a doc who had his own practice- which is very rare these days. 
He asked me how much xanax I was taking, and I lied, and said 6 mg in hopes he’d prescribe more. He did, and over two years w him , I was getting scripts for 14mg. I was so f’n ignorant. I was completely oblivious to how dependent on them, and how much of an arrogant prick I became at the time. It’s quite a long story, yet I was so cavalier bc I was in an aggressive sales business, and I was numb to feelings. I just thrived on the money I was making. Fast forward a decade, and I had to sell my portion of the business, and I took three years off of work to address my situation. 
It took me those three years to address my tolerance, and anxiety. After three years, I’m down to 1-3mg, and looking for supplements to help now that most of the brain fog has lifted. 
I did talk therapy, hypnotherapy, etc to no avail - prob bc I was so addicted to the xanax at the time. 
To put this in context, this began over eighteen years ago, and benzos/anxiety were not talked about much at all. 
Even knowing what I know now, I doubt anyone could’ve talked me out of using so much xanax. 
Sorry for the verbose post, it’s quite cathartic to get this out."
