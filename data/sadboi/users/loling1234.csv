ExNoContact,fp7fcj2,t3_gbnkig,1588369572.0,"I’m sorry you’re feeling that way. 
But perhaps that’s the problem. Diversify. Allow other people to know you deeply even in your next relationship. One person shouldn’t be your everything. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. This is what makes some of our relationships go sour to begin with and very challenging to move on from."
ExNoContact,fp3yrd4,t3_gb1oc3,1588288333.0,"I find that a lot of times an ex trying to establish a friendship is more for their ego. Ride them of guilt if they were wrong in the relationship and also acts as a means of keeping a foot in your life for future reconciliation. 
Best to shut the door"
Mcat,fp3yje1,t1_fp3refb,1588288211.0,Nice!
ExNoContact,fp3yf17,t1_fp3ai65,1588288145.0,Yup it’s the best feeling. The fastest way to get there is to allow those feelings of anger rage sadness etc. journal cry talk about it to trusted friends. Let that shit out! It’s all energy that needs to be released
ExNoContact,fp3accv,t1_fp36r77,1588275849.0,"yes,. the most important thing to remember is that you WILL love again. you will regain everything that you lost"
ExNoContact,fp2ril9,t1_fp2qg15,1588266682.0,Yess. you have to lose it all to gain it all! Risk walking away from everything you know as comfort to gain something better
ExNoContact,fp2rdaa,t1_fp2q06z,1588266611.0,Forgive yourself. We are all at different points of this path of evolution. You aren’t the perfect person you were meant to be yet. This life is a process of sanctification and evolution. Keep growing. Keep loving. You’re not supposed to get it right until the end and even then most dont
ExNoContact,fp2jn30,t1_fp2h9ke,1588262894.0,Yea indifference is the goal!
ExNoContact,fp2f2ly,t1_fp2ezxx,1588260654.0,Indifference is the goal! So liberating and it’s the opposite of love
ExNoContact,fp23wxt,t3_gave84,1588254629.0,Funny enough I think some are still hooking up. Prob more so than ever. Like I know my ex has a live in fuck buddy because they lack the ability to be alone
ExNoContact,fp0742l,t3_gacmnh,1588203727.0,Hit me up also if you need to talk. Was in mine for the same amount of time!! Be strong. It comes in waves!!
ExNoContact,fosjmx7,t3_g95buf,1588032004.0,"I feel your pain. Same here! Ex was reposted on so many pages and is now Instagram popular. 

All that stuff is fleeting. Think of how many celebrities who we think are happy commit suicide. 

They get their 10 seconds of attention/fame and life goes on 

People put on a facade online. Some of the most popular/famous people are the most miserable. They’re slaves to their social media accounts. 

Block her for your own sanity and boss the fuck up. Yield your fruit and heal at your own pace."
ExNoContact,fosj4ml,t3_g980h0,1588031719.0,What helped me was actually imagining them with other people. Forced me to accept it. The world won’t end. Also if you know your worth you can’t remind yourself that they can be with a million ppl and they won’t amount to you. They may be better on paper or have qualities you don’t possess but they don’t have your personality and won’t have the same chemistry. We all have options but the reality is that it is rare to truly find someone you bond with. Only happens a handful of times in our life. So if you truly bonded with this person know that it was special and even through they may be with other people....they will never be you.
ExNoContact,fod6f92,t1_fod4vmc,1587680698.0,There’s a book called the body keeps the score
ExNoContact,fod39g1,t3_g6sajq,1587679299.0,Yesss
ExNoContact,foaup51,t3_g6e2a7,1587652788.0,The trauma is stored inside your body. You need to find a way to release it
ExNoContact,foaubmr,t3_g6mjgf,1587652628.0,I did the same to my ex after months of no contact. Not sure why your ex did it but I did it once I realized there was no getting back together so the blocking was a final step for me in the moving on process. Really to kill the hope of reconciliation. It sucks and hurts but that’s why I did it.
study,fo5mrqj,t3_g5lu5c,1587529593.0,Join a zoom study group where others can see you studying and vis versa
ExNoContact,fo2u356,t3_g57mot,1587474112.0,This is so good. I can’t wait till I’m there
study,fo1swm7,t3_g4yv12,1587440751.0,How are you studying?
ExNoContact,fo1q9pd,t3_g55s1v,1587438979.0,Hmm sounds like you are playing games. Leaving one door open and another closed. I think you should continue to focus on really healing moving forward instead of the timeline of when to block/unblock. You’re focusing too much on him
ExNoContact,fo1kyoh,t3_g55s1v,1587435565.0,"Doesn’t sound like blocking him is even a good idea to be honest. You are putting a lot of thought into it. Block someone when you are really over them and have absolutely no desire to ever reconnect. 
If you unblock him after 2 years then what? You guys reconnect as just friends? Most people you block for any period of time will deeply resent you. So if you have any intention of reconnecting with this person whether it be romantic or not I recommend that you do not block.really examine your motives as to why you want to block someone for a set period of time 
 
Blocking should be final."
ExNoContact,fo1iz77,t3_g54pyd,1587434317.0,Yea the first few weeks are the best. You feel a sense of freedom. Just know that it ebbs and flows. For me it got worse as time went on. Eventually it will get better but it hurt for a long time
ExNoContact,fo1itk2,t3_g54vl1,1587434220.0,"exes do it to see if they still have an emotional pull on you. If you respond it gives them validation and feeds their ego and off they go. 
Best thing you can do is ignore the crumbs. Unless and ex picks up the phone calls or leaves some kind of message where you know they regret the breakup and would like to work things out do not respond to any other communication from them"
ExNoContact,fo1inun,t3_g54vl1,1587434121.0,"Yea lots of hovering going on now. People are bored,lonely , stuck in their thoughts and literally flipping through their contacts to see who they can talk to. Exes coming out of the woodworks. Great time to block them"
ExNoContact,fo1ij87,t3_g55s1v,1587434041.0,Have two years gone by or are you future planning?

Step2,fnticyp,t3_g0srg9,1587242252.0,"Hi please add me [ifn789@gmail.com](mailto:ifn789@gmail.com)

the time frame works"
ExNoContact,fnf8cpq,t3_g0yvbk,1586903282.0,"Interesting. Majority of what ppl call love is limerence. And the mitagating factors are spot on. In immature relationships As soon as you reciprocate...the limerence is  gone and people believe they have fallen out of love and boom..on to the next relationship lol. And the cycle repeats itself. 
It’s not until people educate themselves about this will they realize that true love and commitment begins AFTER the limerence has subsided and the limerence will inevitably subside."
ExNoContact,fnf7nqo,t1_fndl4fu,1586902916.0,"Nah you’re wrong. I’m a woman and actually get turned on as fuck when a man can talk about his feelings and emotions in a mature way. It builds intimacy. 
This guy here is hurt and is venting. Totally diff. The problem with relationships is everybody tries to save face and come off cool. Maybe if someone told her about her self the bitch would change. 
I learned the most about myself from partners who weren’t afraid of being vulnerable and telling me about myself no matter how petty it came off. Some people are completely oblivious to their bullshit. 
It’s actually healthy to call people out on it especially someone you dated."
ExNoContact,fnf7701,t1_fndj3pd,1586902668.0,"Funny thing is it’s not a game. This is life and peoples emotions. It’s totally ok for him to go through the grieving process and let it out in reddit. 
When he’s over it he will be over it. 
She will be the one in rebound relationship after rebound relationship wondering why nothing works. Let him not be over it. 
Even if he understood women, and did the exact opposite of what he’s doing...she may come back out of manipulation..doesn’t change the fact that she doesn’t respect him and will most likely leave again."
ExNoContact,fnf6csp,t1_fne18rw,1586902227.0,You can and I’ll get that from someone else
ExNoContact,fnf64rs,t3_g1ddbp,1586902108.0,Take solace in knowing that nothing real can be threatened. You cannot lose what is meant for you. Gently let it go for now with confidence that if it’s for you it will be...with little effort on your part.
ExNoContact,fna4e85,t3_g0bls4,1586790809.0,That compatibility is all in our heads though. If we were so compatible we would have worked out
ExNoContact,fn84nn7,t1_fn80eae,1586733816.0,I guess they just want to see if you’re happy without them? It’s not flattering
ExNoContact,fn7otmk,t3_g03iiu,1586724624.0,"It’s your ego. Just observe it as such and don’t give it too much weight. Your ego sees her as your possession which she isn’t. Imagine yourself happy with another woman. 
At the end of the day we will all find what is meant for us just accept it now that it may be someone else."
ExNoContact,fn1bz4l,t3_fyqfyv,1586558877.0,Think about how she isn’t texting you!
ExNoContact,fn1bwwj,t3_fyqor0,1586558842.0,How do you feel? Good or bad?
nocontact,fmxm48t,t3_fxvtl0,1586467560.0,"I think it depends on the quality of your relationship. Was there abuse, cheating? 
If not and you guys just weren’t compatible then I would be a friend for now.but if it was a toxic relationship that was detrimental to your health then you don’t owe her anything. There are people out there who can help her. Guide her in their direction. 
All the best. These are tough times for everyone. Doesn’t necessarily mean you have to open doors that should be closed"
Residency,fmurqix,t1_fmo7pz5,1586397446.0,Exactly. I don’t know if any attending saying they regret it. Residency sucks. That’s all
ExNoContact,fmupr8g,t1_fmtt6u6,1586396253.0,Lol most people aren’t thinking straight. Best to wait till post pandemic
BPD,fmupntm,t3_fx7v1p,1586396195.0,I felt relieved for the first few weeks. Now the reality of not having an income is settling in. Not fun anymore
ExNoContact,fms6546,t3_fwwtl7,1586347756.0,"I feel like In this day in age with social media and dating apps 3 months is considered a long time to most. And enough time to move on. Although I disagree. 
Mine waited a month if that."
ExNoContact,fms4ky2,t1_fmrz0w4,1586346383.0,You’re not alone. It’s really addictive. True closure happens when you stop that
ExNoContact,fmrdc2v,t1_fmrd13o,1586319973.0,"You’re focusing on them and not prioritizing your mental health. 

Tell yourself that you will rekindle with them much later when you are over them and explain to them why you had to block. 
If it helps at all I’ve spoken again to all my exes that were blocked once I was no longer in that crazy addictive phase and explained the reason for the block

Everyone does what they need to to survive a break up. Some people rebound and start sleeping around, some people post non stop on social media. Do whatever YOU have to do to get healthy. 

The block isnt a forever thing. Just until you get over them and are no longer emotionally controlled."
ExNoContact,fmqzs7n,t3_fwe5bx,1586310622.0,"I’ve been there. It’s a special kind of hell to be in. Just know that while you are holding onto hope, you are wasting you life and will never move on.  It’s literally torture. It took me 5 months of not being able to block them,them not reaching out to finally give up hope and hit the block button. The healing won’t start until you ditch the hope and block. You can literally double your healing time by hanging on to hope. I could have been over them and ready to get back out there if I was strong enough to block from the start. 
But be kind to yourself. Do things when you are ready."
ExNoContact,fmqzdol,t1_fmocjpn,1586310369.0,"Negative. I respect a man who prioritizes his mental and physical health. 

I don’t respect men who lurk and still Hoover/come back months or years later because they never took the necessary steps to properly heal and move on in an attempt to appear “strong”."
ExNoContact,fmqysxe,t1_fmo4m31,1586310013.0,"I think that’s the very problem with a lot of relationships  to begin with. The need to appear unfazed and unbothered. 
The reluctance to show vulnerability and to be human. 

It’s perfectly ok to be affected by someone you dated, slept with and shared your life with for any amount of time. 

Fuck this shit we call love these days. No wonder why divorce rates are so high."
ExNoContact,fmqydkj,t3_fwg84k,1586309744.0,Just make sure if you block her you don’t unblock
ExNoContact,fmqy27b,t1_fmps8kq,1586309550.0,I guess we are all the same
ExNoContact,fmqy0p6,t1_fmpoicw,1586309523.0,It gets better I promise
ExNoContact,fmqxu6j,t1_fmqdb2k,1586309411.0,If you are religious try making a promise to God that you won’t check his social media. That’s what literally helped me. I gave up checking his Ig for lent. And now it’s my new norm. All u need is 30 days to create a habit. Just get through the first 30 days.
ExNoContact,fmqx9gj,t3_fwwtl7,1586309054.0,Sorry to hear that. Keep your head up. It’s just a rebound. But please don’t take her back if she comes back. I made that mistake

BPD,fmfmr7v,t1_fj960k6,1586030520.0,That’s a living hell. Been there. Block his number to kill that hope. Literally helped me instantly.
BPD,fmfmayg,t1_fmfibbz,1586030240.0,Can’t find them. Share the link if u can
BPD,fmflzti,t1_fmflony,1586030051.0,This thread is referring to the person not being texted first or included. I’m asking about being responded to. Thanks though
NarcissisticAbuse,fmb78j1,t1_fmb52lh,1585920134.0,"Sorry you went through that she sounds like a user and I don’t understand why life keeps blessing people like that. Why do they continue to excel?
I got off social media for a month but my idiot friend texted me they information so I went and looked. 
And doesn’t it feel like you’re giving one person so much power to have to ditch social media completely? I agree that’s what I need to do but I’m baffled as to how I am so affected by this and she’s fine??"
ExNoContact,flvakep,t1_flv5m2j,1585519796.0,How long were you together with your ex?
Mcat,fltww2e,t1_flsqxzd,1585489603.0,Lol I thought it was just me that thought the qpacks were super easy
Mcat,fltwsbb,t3_fqye3e,1585489521.0,Virtual study buddy? What exactly are you looking for in a study buddy? Someone to talk about concepts with? Motivate you?
lawofattraction,flp4cat,t1_flp47uw,1585351402.0,How do you do the work?
seduction,flokadl,t3_fpkkdp,1585339936.0,Is there a post for 13 ways to make a man want you?
seduction,flok8qq,t1_flmiw5h,1585339911.0,I guess. Sounds a bit like game playing. A woman recognizes a sought after  man when she sees one. No need for you to even put effort into making her know this. It will be obvious. Anyman who goes out of his way to show me this even if it’s just the possibility wouldn’t be taken seriously.
seduction,flmarqw,t3_fpkkdp,1585278691.0,Umm having other girls in your life..be careful with that one. Id run for the hills. No mature woman wants that drama
BPD,fliszap,t1_flisk5o,1585189983.0,This is so good! Incredibly hard but good. Thank you!
ExNoContact,fli3men,t1_fli3crk,1585174676.0,Interesting take. I need to stop trying to decipher the meaning and not read into it. But wiping the slate clean 6 months later lol the shits already been clean it’s been months!
ExNoContact,fli2wsr,t1_fli26ec,1585174288.0,It was actually a calendar not a photo album. Just feels extra to now delete it
ExNoContact,flhz2hm,t3_foyix4,1585172194.0,"I was in your shoes. 
Remember women have hormones that bind them more to their mates (oxytocin) especially if you were sexually involved. 
Men can move on to a new sexual partner quickly. Doesn’t mean emotionally he’s moved on. This is what they typically do. They start sleeping with someone else and fool themselves into thinking they are good...in the mean time you actually take the time to move on. By the time he realizes sex gets old or the new relationship isn’t perfect he will seek you out. Hopefully you would have been long gone by then"
BPD,flhynyy,t1_flhylks,1585171978.0,Right which is what drives me crazy. It’s like we are all afraid to be vulnerable and wonder why our relationships struggle
BPD,flhyk0i,t1_flhydm1,1585171920.0,Is it wrong to mention that you notice a change in their demeanor
BPD,flhyig1,t1_flho0r3,1585171897.0,Me to! And usually I’m right
BPD,flhyh28,t1_flgychg,1585171876.0,So when they return do you bring it up or just proceed as normal? Does it breed resentment?
BPD,flbnm5x,t3_fnk1kh,1585008453.0,"I find that the first several months when I don’t really care or not emotionally invested I’m great. The guys love me, I’m low maintenance and can give two shits what they do. 
Once I’m emotionally invested....forget it. 
So I try so hard to remain aloof as long as possible. But that backfired because it attracts men who are into the chase and triggers their abandonment issues if they have any. 
Learning to find middle ground."
BPD,flbne7r,t3_fnk1kh,1585008311.0,"For those who agree that dating with BPD sucks, out of curiosity are you all in treatment or on meds?

I would like to assume that dating is manageable with DBT or medication"
BPD,flb8jtm,t1_flb8dwf,1584999560.0,You wouldn’t be here if that recommendation were a good one lol
BPD,fl5aqis,t1_fl59vee,1584832372.0,I hope so
