My ECT had me kind of spacey and bleary for a couple of months afterward (but no longer suicidal, so an important improvement)...then I started slowly noticing that I was feeling more myself. After 6 months I was doing really well. I later got in touch with my ECT doc at Duke and talked with him about how/why it works, as I was talking on a small podcast about my experience with my mental health and I wanted to present ECT in a way that could help dispel some fear and stigma about it. He told me they have found that a small improvement is immediate (such as less severe brain fog, or the ability to focus for a bit longer on something) - but that the major improvements come over a period of months as the brain essentially heals from the induced trauma of the ECT. Builds new pathways perhaps - they‚Äôre not sure. But you have every reason to believe you will still be seeing positive effects from this soon."

Not a damn thing is your fault right now. You‚Äôre sick and need help and in a just world you‚Äôd have it by now. Please remember we will listen any time, no judgment, offer all the unsolicited advice you could ever dream of (ha), and do anything to help we can.

At my darkest, low doses of lithium helped me from totally bottoming out. I wound up getting the most help from ECT, but I was always scared of lithium and wouldn‚Äôt go on it. Low dose wound up helping my suicidal ideation and crazy intense anxiety. It also took away my taste for alcohol, which I had been abusing to deal with all the heaviness of life. That‚Äôs my experience, FWIW.

Finally, I want to say that losing a child at any stage is a deep grief that I wish you never had to go through. What a heavy burden to carry. So much of your pain and sadness is 100% natural, and nothing any of our meds or advice could make go away any faster. You are deserving of so much tenderness and kindness and care, and if you feel alone I hope you will sometimes try to be the one to be kind and caring to yourself. Lots of love to you."

Kids need some boundaries and to learn that their actions have consequences, and they want to know their parents are paying attention. 

I always felt crazy lucky to have parents who were so cool and sweet and kind to me, but guess who went off to college in NYC and became a big ol‚Äô drug addict and dropped out of college? I had zero self discipline. Didn‚Äôt even know how to wash my own clothes...was the WORST roommate...didn‚Äôt have any self respect...

They were raising me as a response to the way THEY were raised. They wanted to love me unconditionally and let me ‚Äúbe me‚Äù. I was not spoiled with Things but I was spoiled with permission. 

So of course, now, I‚Äôm trying to find a balance with my kid. Show her there are expectations, boundaries, and consequences to her actions, and make sure she feels loved and accepted for who she is. I‚Äôm demonstrative in my love, which my parents taught me (I think this is important and I want to pass this on), and while it‚Äôs hard for me to be a disciplinarian since I never had it growing up (sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm being ‚Äúmean‚Äù) I know I‚Äôm giving her the structure she needs.
