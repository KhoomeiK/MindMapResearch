I was just yesterday talking about how Ive only really had one person in my life who truly cared about my wellbeing and success stories. 
Sadly she passed away a long time ago.
But thats kind of why I signed up to reddit.
If its any consolation, id love to hear your success stories and share mine with you all. 
I genuinely get a kick knowing that someone deserving is doing well in life.

DoesAnybodyElse,flhgai3,t3_fojmyi,1585162080.0,"Its interesting that somehow you know that they're doing this for compliments. 
Alot of people do have genuine issues with their appearance and feel an immeasurable amount of hate towards themselves. 
Sometimes they feel more comfortable being around others when they've put their feelings out in the open. 

I really do believe that we could all try harder to be more understanding towards others.
None of us really know every detail of others lives and the struggles they might be facing."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fkqauem,t3_fjxigm,1584438201.0,"Hi. I live in the uk and have moved all around the country.
I would say that everywhere ive moved to and made new friends. There has been 7 or 8 people who are spitting images of people i knew from previous places. It does seem very strange, but i guess there are so many people in the world that it would be more strange not to come across someone who looks familiar now and again."

AMA,fiq81xa,t1_fiq6vx3,1582637820.0,"Hey. 
I think the stupidest thing people say would be. 
Just get over it or stop thinking about your past.

As theres alot of awareness of anxiety and depression where I am I dont really get asked alot of stupid questions and I guess in order to raise awareness further Im happy to answer any questions. Stupid or not."
AMA,fiq77mq,t1_fiq6bot,1582637138.0,"Thank you. Im proud of anyone who manages to live with depression so the feeling is very much mutual.
I have the same take on the topic aswell. I would hate to hurt anyone close to me or leave them behind. As you know though, there can be very dark moments where suicide seems like the only option. 
Im quite happy to share anything too, as long as it helps.
When i was growing up i was a very sensitive kid. I wanted to help others and was puzzled when others were nasty. As a result i would isolate myself in order to avoid confrontation and bullying. 
As a result of isolation and alot of drama and violence in my life i became over empathetic very early on in life and would over think alot. 
Id say my first realization was at the age of about eight years. 
Hope this helps x"
AskReddit,fiq236v,t3_f91hif,1582632462.0,"Well. One weekend my Dad and I decide to go to a tool convention and we get talking to a guy doing a carving demo. I really liked the idea of learning a new skill so I bought a knife and hook knife. 

After getting back that weekend I didnt really have the time to give them a go so it had to wait until the next weekend. 
I sat down early Saturday morning and started whittling away at a bit of pine from the workshop. 
I should say at this point, when purchasing said tools the guy showed us how to use them safely and told us countless times that we should always use safe carving techniques. 
So, I make the first cut and everything is going well. I start carving a spoon shape. Im gettimg really into it and I turn the knife towards me to split a large section away for the handle. 
The knife slips and I scrape my hand but think nothing of it but stop to take a break and watch tv. After about a minute a start to feel a little light headed and get up to go to the loo. As I stand I hear a splash, I look down and there is a pool of blood on the floor. It had been collecting on my lap. 
Finally I take a look at my hand and there's a two inch slash about 10mm deep just below my thumb.
Time to go to hospital I think. 

Seven stitches later I think Ive learnt my lesson üòÖ"
DoesAnybodyElse,fimodzu,t3_f8nhmu,1582539899.0,"In todays world of technology and infinite reason not to have face to face conversation with people how could we not get tired of life. 
We are so controled by what we're led to believe is the life pattern we should all follow. Get a good job, find love, get married, have kids. 

My advice to anyone would be to ignore whats expected of you and embrace the things you desire. 
Who said we need to follow a plan that has been set out infront of us.

Put your phones down, go outside and enjoy the world for what it is without the influence of man. Experience life for what it really is! 
And that is the freedom to make your own plan and follow an awakened path that feels right for you!!"

I have always had a strong opinion that up until your thirties you are just learning how life works and as depressing as it may sound, the rest of your life is just spent abiding by the rules and expectations that are forced upon you. 

On the other hand! Make the most of the life you have and have fun with it üëç"

helpme,fie82o8,t3_f0r2az,1582376147.0,"Let me start by saying we all love you whether we know you or not. All the coments to your post are proof that people want to help you and care for you.

I have struggled with depression and anxiety for most of my life so i can relate to suicidal thoughts. It takes a lot to get through that! But with our ongoing support you will. We'll be here for all the bumps in the road and eventually you'll find yourself in a position to help someone else who feels this way. When that happens you'll realise, even though you've been through alot of shit, the reward of sticking around, saying F you to the ones that hurt you and helping others that need you will put it all into perspective. 

WE NEED YOU TO LIVE!

So instead of advice I would like to offer you friendship and support whenever you need it for the rest of your, hopefully long life! 

REMEMBER! WE ALL LOVE YOU!!"
