The only time I’d prioritize another’s over your own is if there’s suicide. Personally, I remember calling an online friend’s police department half way across the US to make sure her attempt would not take place. But that is a physical safety thing. Otherwise, you need to be able to stand solidly yourself before you can help support others."

Just because things are allowed to reopen does not mean they will and people are still going to take things seriously, but the curve has been flattened enough that we can feel secure, especially in less densely populated areas, to let the economy start to come back. Keep in mind, lots of people in very sparse areas where things that might not be “essential” to normal folk, are something they might need access to. Rules that work well in very populated areas tend to be detrimental to people who might only see another person once a week anyway. 

America is a very diverse country in terms of terrain, population density, life styles, culture, etc. trust people to know what’s right for their part of the country and do your best to protect your part.

Edit: 

Also just because people can do things doesn’t mean they will. My brother is an extrovert stuck in a house with 4 introverts.
