Let me preface this by saying Jaehyun is my bias wrecker in NCT127, so maybe this will seem biased for those who think they're all holy and their shit don't stink for stanning someone who hasn't fucked up. __*Yes, they may not have broken any rules, but they put themselves, their members, their managers, staff and others at risk for a very, very likely second wave.*__ It was irresponsible for them to go out at a time like this, but hopefully now they'll see what their actions could have potentially caused and this backlash makes them think what might have happened if it was just a few days later.

Now, if you allow me a moment to be pissed off and deeply annoyed, if you're bitching about them going out, but you yourself are going out with friends, partying and all that bullshit, you have no space to say __*a damn thing*__ about them going out.

Me and my mom grab them for my family, that's 6 people, 3 cats and 2 dogs, my next door neighbor, who is 5 people, one of whom is a toddler, my sister's family who lives out in the boondocks and the closest store near her is a little fishing shack, my sister's ex who has 3 kids, one of whom is my niece and for my little brother's two friends' family.

So that is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 families right there. 2 cases per each family.
