SO theres THAT

i can work crazy overtime now that my work is right in my bedroom and i dont have to drive an hour back and forth every time i want to work some OT. 

now that we can all work great and be productive from home, I may not ever have to go back into the office  which was 20 miles away from home. I can now work right down the street from my daughters school (if she ever goes back).  im saving many hours of my life not having to commute and im saving loads of money on my gas bill. i was constantly borrowing money to make it to the next paycheck (just $40 or 20 here or there) and now i dont because im saving tons of money and i am also working lots of OT and getting extra money. 

My mental health is taking a hit but i just started writing again and i consume myself with work so i dont sit and think too much.
