ChildPsychology,fqlschb,t1_fqlqs9o,1589465145.0,"If you feel the need to have an affair, you have problems. That's ok. Everyone does. You're making posts like ""why is he ignoring me???"" about the dude with a WIFE blah fucking blah. You obviously feel like there is something wrong with you sexually or intimately. It is obviously YOUR problem. Because you view your kid as yourself as a kid (you just admitted by bringing up your own daddy issues) you are now projecting your own insecurities onto him which are... That there is something wrong with him because he isn't masturbating at 15. He's a fucking kid. He is fine. YOU are not. Get a therapist. There is nothing wrong with that. Pushing it onto your kid... There is something wrong with that. Therapy is a way to ""better be safe than sorry."" Invading your kids privacy and making them feel broken is not safe at all..... 

P. S. Sociopathy isn't real. ASPD and NPD are. Educate your ignorant self. A lot of us were raised by ""sociopath dads."" Having ASPD doesn't make you a shitty person. Being a shitty person makes a shitty person."

TrueOffMyChest,fq9tc6h,t1_fq90wk6,1589206631.0,"Respect for you and your illness, but this is dangerously misleading. Sociopathy isn't a thing. ASPD is the only diagnoses in the DSM-5. It is caused by trauma mostly, not always from parents. Could be from a painful chronic disease, for example. Some folks with ASPD claim to be born that way. And most people with ASPD are smart enough to imitate emotions and respect for people. Hollywood has really fucked up mental health. Having a disorder doesn't make you a shitty person. Being a shitty person makes you a shitty person."

I think it might be more of a human nature thing (or logical, depending on how you look at it) to save oneself in that situation... also... it is against most people's morals to kill.

It was unbelievably fucking hard letting her go. It has been nearly 3 years now, and I can say, all I feel is joy when I think about her. These are absolutely happy tears. The time we got to spend with them was precious and something you just have to be grateful for. You have to remember that she was in pain, and it was necessary.
