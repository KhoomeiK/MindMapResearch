 I  try to get there before It starts, as I seem to calm quicker in  there; especially when I'm in the house alone.

Think I prefer it; as it's a very enclosed space, very few sensory stimulations and just feels secure as a result.
unlike other rooms in the house because it has nothing other than washing associated to it, I can decompress and get a handle on my aniexty faster. 
Also less likely to be bothered by anyone especially when the door is shut ðŸ˜…"

MENSA person here....I did terrible at college due to the pressure applied on me due to the above fact and my own expectations... I mean we're talking C's, D's and lower here! 

Struggled alot with uni due to the constant expectations to preform; despite doing well in 1st/2nd year (high 2:1/boarder line 1st)  and I ended up swapping degrees start of my 3rd yr.
By the end of the 1st year of my new degree my aniexty and other physical health was so bad;  I missed so much study material, I scraped a 2:2 in my exams.That plus afew personal reasons;  resulted in me indefinitely suspending my  studies and leaving uni... Ngl I felt like a right failure for leaving but it had to be done, as my MH was spiralling down at a rapid rate. 

  In fairness, I genuinely feel ""gifted"" lable contributed alot to my social anxiety; 
The extra study classes I was made to take and the  bullying , made me really isolated as a child.
Which in turn has had an impact on my social skills as an adult...alot of work has had to go into these! 

On the plus,  I now work a job I  feel comfortable in (which helps the social aspect alot) and it has room for progression too :) 
 I feel less like a failure these days, as working serval jobs before now; really showed me academic credentails help but aren't always needed!  On the materialistic side of things,  I don't feel too bad either as pay is pretty much what my grad job  pay would have been.  

I'd honestly say being worried for your future is normal.Every grad is in some shape, quantity or form.
 Just remember in the"" real world""  having passions and interests is good. Following them and being an indervidual  is encouraged :)
  
You will be challenged by some and maybe explaining to them how you feel will help. learning new things and being bad at them is expected;  As long as you can acknowledge the failing and ask for any  help needed going forward! 

You don't have to tell people about your gifted past either if you don't want too; most adults only care for the here and now, which means alot less expectations.Just remember who you are as a person and that how you apply and approach situations; matters more than knowledge alone :)"
Anxiety,fn65rwj,t3_fzs1g7,1586688529.0,"I used to be like this with mine.. I was already on the drink due to a very messy breakup and somehow it just manifested over time, into a coping mechanism to mange my anxiety.At 1st i just drank to get rid of social anxiety  for large social situations and then as time went on I used it to deal with any anxious feeling..

Drink became a dangerous crutch till my mates coaxed me to seek help at university  for it.

Best advice is stop the habit  asap and confront yourself and feelings  when you feel you need to have those ""few shots"" for the anxiety. 
It's good you've already got the worry it's not healthy, as you've still the control over the situation. It's hella alot better to seek support or make some other plan for when that feeling arises.

You soon get used to the endorphins and elevated feeling of not having anxiety and feeling ""normal /calm"" etc with drink and without realising it can spiral , even when you think you are in-control."
Anxiety,fn64ucr,t3_fzm0k0,1586687476.0,"It's a constant nagg..
Since my anxiety got bad, I can barely focus on a task for more than 5-10 mins tops before I swap to something else because I feel i could be spending my time better or I feel like im annoying others.. often means things are left half done or forgotten about; which equally then adds to the ""worry"" cycle."

Usually feels like being  very drunk but  without the happy and you've somehow gotta continue to remind yourself it's okay and that you can function as a human. Last time i went to the Dr's with it, they just said it's Physical symptoms of the mental illness and that its normal for some to get physical manifestations  and gave me some anti-sickness tablets to try clear the nausea..ngl it was reassuring asf to hear from the dr it wasnt me overthinking!"
