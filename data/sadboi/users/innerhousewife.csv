My Mom had a massive heart attack in 2011 and I went to the hospital thinking it was a minor thing-I walked into the ER and discovered she was a STEMI with tombstones on her EKG. At the time I ran the Cath lab that they were attempting to airlift her too. I called one of the cardiologists that I knew and just handed the phone to the ER physician. We ended up coding her and by the time the helicopter got there she was too unstable to transport and she died shortly after. Even though I know we did everything that could be done, I still felt guilty like I had let her down somehow. Maybe you can take a small measure of comfort in the fact that you got to be there with him and your Mom-your presence probably provided more relief and comfort to both your parents than you can ever realize, but it‚Äôs too soon to see that now. (Had you NOT been there, your Mom most likely wouldn‚Äôt have been capable of doing CPR.) Please don‚Äôt judge yourself harshly or go down the road of ‚Äúif only..‚Äù.

TravelHacks,eynv3zk,t3_cxo9t4,1567262810.0,"Just got back from an annual NYC trip-for transportation they should buy a weekly transit ticket-the daily ends up being more expensive. Using public transportation is also another way to see the city-it adds another dimension. Agreed on skipping Ellis Island/Statue of Liberty because the free ferry gives you a decent view but if it‚Äôs important to them then they should plan on that taking up pretty much most of the day. If they are adventurous eaters, they can google ‚Äúcheap eats NYC‚Äù and get tons of great recommendations for wonderful food to try. As far as a cross purse goes-I once bought one from someone who sold 31 bags-it was larger and would hold water bottles or shoes. Have been to NYC numerous times and have never felt unsafe.
