When my son with in BMT (Air Force) he had to clean bathrooms, floors, laundry, etc. Your husband knows. Heâ€™s just being selfish and lazy. As for the rest, I wish I could tell you what to do.

narcissism,eyrmpz3,t1_eyrl88q,1567372633.0,"You never diagnose fully off of he said she said. This is where years of schooling and training come in. Itâ€™s not like you can become a therapist after four years of schooling. To become one that can actually diagnose you have to go through masters minimum but even further a PhD for psychologist. On top of that you have to do lots of hours of clinicals before you can even practice.  On top of continued education to stay on par. They know the right questions to ask as well as specific ques to see.  Plus if the person doesnâ€™t believe they have a problem why would they go to get help?? It takes time and lots of evaluation to come to a actual diagnosis and not just a potential diagnose.

I havenâ€™t finished my education (currently going to school to become a psychologist), but from my studies, most times than not narcissists typically donâ€™t see themselves as a narcissist.  Most narcissists wonâ€™t go for any kind of diagnosis/therapy because they donâ€™t believe that who they are is Â«Â badÂ Â» per se. Just know there is a lot more in play in the diagnosis than ego. One of the primary distinctions is lack of empathy among many other things.
