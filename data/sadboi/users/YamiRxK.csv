Anxiety,fqnk4zq,t1_fqnf8g4,1589496297.0,"Yeah crazy is an understatement, it evidently does so much more good than bad. If it's legal it can also be safely & ethically grown and sold to people who need it. Also from an economical standpoint I think it would do more good to legalise it now than ever. It will create more jobs which means more taxpayers, the government could even tax the weed to help reimburse the economy since it's gone to shit. It's a no brainer to me but sadly there are still many who disagree.

On a side note you should look up 5-HTP if you haven't already done so.  It's what I use alongside the devils lettuce to maintain a somewhat functional brain. It has a lot of positive reviews and from personal experience I have definitely noticed a shift in mood. I feel way more productive and less self destructive which is pretty good."

Win or lose just be critical of what you are doing in game that was good and what was bad and make the effort to do better each time. Doing better doesn't mean having a good kda. It means maintaining good vision of the enemy jungle paths, peeling the adc so he can farm/tf safely, zoning the enemy laners if you have an advantage, not getting caught etc.

My bad habit is spamming Q in lane and missing more often than hitting it. This creates windows for my opponents to engage me and my adc which results in losing trades or even getting killed. I started to poke more with autos and save Q for counter engages or after a meep slows them for the electrocution proc and i've had more success. You just need to know the enemy champs and play around their weaknesses. League is not just knowing your champ well, it's about knowing the enemy champ too."
