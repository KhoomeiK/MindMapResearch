Anxiety,ewo2dwb,t3_cnmz0o,1565602397.0,"Hi everyone,
    I am writing to everyone here to let you all know that there is hope for those of you suffering with anxiety. I myself have suffered with it for a while. I am 36 years old but finally feel I can say that I live a healthy and rewarding life with my wife and daughter. 
     To give you a bit of backstory, I was 24 years old when I started having severe anxiety in my adulthood. However, I did have anxiety in spurts when I was a kid but my parents just kinda pushed it off and threw it under the carpet. I used to think of these bad scenarios like what if my family and I would get into a car accident one day. From there on out, EVERY single time someone in my house would go into a car, I would think that bad thought that we would die each and every time. It became obsessive to the point I thought something was very wrong with me. I had other ‘twisted thoughts’ too, but this is just one example. As time passed, I managed to kinda just grow out of it though and didn’t really worry about it until I was 24 and ready to start a family with my lovely wife. 
     Let me begin by saying my wife is an angel. She is beautiful, smart, and an amazing person. Sometimes I wonder how I ever got her? Haha but that is a post for a different form. Any who, I met her in college when I was 21 and she was 20. We dated for three years, when I decided I wanted to marry her. Things were amazing, but then my anxiety kicked in. I began thinking things that made no literal sense such as what if she isn’t the right person for me? Or what if I hurt her? What if she doesn’t love me enough? Etc. 
     Things got bad real quick. I tried sharing these concerns with her, but she thought I didn’t love her enough. That was NOT the case! I loved her too much and just had an over-worked mind. She decided she did not want to marry me and went back with her ex. I was devastated, realizing what an asshole I was to push the only truly good thing I had out of my life. But this story does end happy, so keep that in mind!
     I hit an all time low when she left me. I went on Zoloft as I was super depressed and even would cut myself sometimes. However one day it hit me. That I WANTED to be better and I was going to be. I decided to grow a pair of balls and realize that I was not going to let one organ of many (my brain) dictate my entire life. I got my shit together by not stopping my negative thoughts but by stopping attaching meaning to those thoughts. I may have thought some of the same things I did previously but I didn’t let them affect me. I knew they were just my inner low self esteem acting out, trying to sabotage myself. It took time, lots of time and patience (almost a year). But when I began this process, I had the incentive to overcome my stupid fears because I lost something so real. I worked every day to get back my girlfriend and eventually I succeeded. Today, I can say that I don’t even have those thoughts anymore and can comfortably talk about it without fear. The key is believing you are okay! 
     I’m sorry for making this so long. But if there is anyone who is going through what I did or anything similar, please don’t hesitate at all to reach out to me as I would gladly share in detail how I overcame my anxiety. I just feel bad posting all those boring details to the poor fellas who are reading this post! 

All the best guys,
