AskReddit,fpmsk56,t3_gdzb3i,1588740587.0,"My senior year, some idiot broke into the school, one Saturday and trashed the changing rooms in the theater room.

Fast forward to that Monday, and me and four of my friends, who had a been at a party, that Saturday night, get called into the office.

The assistant principal sits us all down, and tells us, that he got a ""tip"" that we were the ones that had trashed the rooms. We, of course looked at each other in disbelief, and each told the principal that we had nothing to do with it, and that it was impossible, because we had all been at a party that night.

He then said that he knew that we were at the party together, and that we had left the party, and that's when we decided to break into the school.

Long story short, come to find out, he had misunderstood the person that had given him this ""tip"" and thought he said the name of one of the guy's we were with, for another guy, who's last name ""sounded very similar.""

We all demanded an apology from the school's administration, but we were told it would not be happening. Such a strange occurrence."

I know everyone says that... but it's what you have to do. 

Right now your mind is conditioned to ""be a certain way.""

What I mean is, the laying in bed, the drinking, only perpetuates the problem (again, something else everyone always says, I know!) but let me explain: your mind gets used to you acting and being a certain way - laziness (for example only) only causes more laziness, because that's what your mind and body begin to crave, in a sense. 

You have to disrupt this mindset; and here's the hardest part: you have to just. do. it. And you're not going to want to do it. You're going to feel like you can't do it. I've been there. But I realized I HAD to pour out that $40 bottle of tequila, I had in just bought (it was one of many). I knew I had to cut ties with toxic people, in my life, that I KNEW weren't really my friends. I knew I had to get out of bed, put on my shoes and just go for a walk. 
Anything to change the setting I was in.

It's going to be hard. 

You're not going to like it...

But again, it's only because that's what your body has become accustomed to. 

It's just like starting an exercise routine (which I HIGHLY recommend you start, as well!)
Your body's gonna absolutely hate you for it, at first, but over time, you'll get used to it, and will probably actually like it (yay endorphins!) 

So again, you have to change things up. Shake up your  routine. Hell...get on some medication, talk to someone! 

This is a fight! Literally for your life! But you can do it! And it will probably take some time - and there will be times where you will think that you can't do it, and want to give up; that's the nature of this disorder. 

But you have get back out there, and keep at it. It's the only way. That's what any and every therapist and doctor will tell you. Only you can fix yourself. It's the hardest thing you'll probably ever face. But find strength in your pain. 
Find a way to make it motivate you! 

You can do this! 

We're all here for you! 

You just have to believe in yourself!
