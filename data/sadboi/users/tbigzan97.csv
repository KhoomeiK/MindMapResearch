Competitiveoverwatch,fqupui4,t1_fquio39,1589662743.0,Even seconds get nano and Genji doesnt
Competitiveoverwatch,fqhqd6a,t1_fqhpqaa,1589382284.0,But her ult atributes combined to his make her a better Genji than him lol
Competitiveoverwatch,fqhpfl7,t1_fqhp8sh,1589381742.0,Yes but she doesnt have his downsides when turning to Genji cause if something goes wrong she can escape with full health once back to normal lol
Competitiveoverwatch,fqhowkm,t1_fqho2cm,1589381431.0,"Cause if she dies she goes back to normal while Genji goes back to spawn. Also, she  can charge dragon blade in like 2-3 seconds."
Competitiveoverwatch,fqhdflx,t1_fqh4k0b,1589374585.0,Why exactly should i care she is useless? I mean... she makes Genji looks even more of a trash by stealing his ult and getting more valua than him with it.
Competitiveoverwatch,fqfci78,t3_gijn84,1589322468.0,In my opinion id literally watch a whole year of Genji dive in owl lol.
Competitiveoverwatch,fpsyn27,t1_fpsyi3h,1588881833.0,"I play all tanks except Hammond, but my will to play a match is immediatly erased as soon as i see a Mei."
Competitiveoverwatch,fpswwc5,t1_fpslu25,1588880990.0,This is cause tank players are in extinction.
2Booty,fpswcv4,t1_fpsez9a,1588880730.0,"Her ass look bigger if u see it under the skirt. Idk i may look like a perv saying this, but not actually being able to see it makes it better so i always leave her skirt on lol"
Competitiveoverwatch,fpepe1k,t1_fpe6m4v,1588552115.0,I think Terry might voice a character one day in OW and even tho i love him i'm happy af with our current Doom. He could do a good Mauga tho depending on his personality and stuff.
Competitiveoverwatch,fpepaus,t1_fpe2w2g,1588552060.0,"i'd laugh my ass off if ""so unlucky"" became a voiceline for Doomfist LOL"
titanfolk,fob9brm,t1_fo9zyjq,1587657456.0,She will look absolutely amazing in her new design in the anime.
Overwatch,fo75ft3,t3_g5ttqx,1587572569.0,U complain about Mei yet u solo barrage a solo grav reaper lol
titanfolk,fo6k0zq,t1_fo6dyti,1587560724.0,He started acting cold after he kissed Historia's hand which was before he got the warhammer.

Overwatch,fmwqqhl,t1_fmwnf6d,1586451357.0,I got a 5k nanoblade thanks to my Ana and a Moira got POTG by throwing a random orb and healing. How is this fair? The ana 100% deserved the play for the pocket she gave me and the nano.
titanfolk,fmwh04o,t3_fxnon5,1586446421.0,I had a dream yesterday with all current titans left fighting and before said fight Annie would give them a crystal armor lol
depression,fmwcrt7,t3_fxonxg,1586444190.0,How exactly being into nerdy things is bad? U r literally my type lol
Competitiveoverwatch,fmeny94,t3_fum4u8,1586009414.0,I got a 5k nano blade and who got the play was the Moira that healed tanks and threw a random damage orb. The potg system should reward multiple plays so the play belonged to Ana and me not her.
nier,fm1ionf,t1_fm1i7ry,1585679134.0,If you think the differences arent huge u didnt play both.
depression,fm0va85,t3_fs7193,1585666862.0,You are not alone in that.
nier,fm0mdz9,t1_fm06vyy,1585661507.0,You people that defend gestalt always use the same braindead argument. The relationship with Kainé is awful in gestalt version cause it makes no sense. In the original there is a huge difference in their dialogues and cutscenes. Play the fucking version first and complain later.
nier,fm0lx75,t1_flzw8fy,1585661184.0,That would require major changes to the story.
nier,fm0lqw7,t1_flzkgbb,1585661062.0,People in the west ONLY played that version. We now have a chance to experience the real game.
Competitiveoverwatch,fly0837,t1_flxt5xf,1585593138.0,"Yes, but Lúcio enables Rein/Zarya which enables Mei which counters most comps because Mei is busted."
depression,flxz04q,t1_flxr3p6,1585592498.0,I wish i had supportive parents so i could talk to them.
titanfolk,flukciz,t3_fr33hi,1585504345.0,This is probably the reason why he said those things to her.
Competitiveoverwatch,flkwugl,t1_flkv1gl,1585249173.0,Yes but they are gonna make multiple things better so i at least hope this is one of them.
Competitiveoverwatch,flk4okh,t1_flk49nf,1585233855.0,No. I just hope this gets fixed cause its one of the most inconsistent mechanics in the game. Unless they allow wallclimb heroes to climb indefinitely all i can hope is for them to fix it with the new engine.
Competitiveoverwatch,flk427o,t1_fljn9yd,1585233485.0,Thats probably something that hopefully will be fixed with OW2 engine.
Overwatch,fl6rusu,t3_fmkou6,1584881356.0,Sure... now do all of those during a match. With Echo is super easy to delete a tank because right click is easy to hit them.
Competitiveoverwatch,fl2e5m0,t1_fl2b6li,1584748948.0,So what? just cause the person mains genji they're not allowed to make a post with suggestions?
titanfolk,fl241jm,t3_fm3s6l,1584742454.0,Can't wait to see her animated in season 4. She'll look incredible with her new visual.
offmychest,fl224z8,t1_fl21wxk,1584741244.0,Thank you. Then it seems i've made the right decision temporarely. I really appreciate you took your time to give me this advice in this important moment. She already knows that i'll be waiting for her and she is okay with it. Even said me that would be ok if i took a step back as she understood that if the situation was reverted she'd probably be way worse than i am.
nier,fl21lns,t3_flzyy2,1584740904.0,Only game you'll ever get close to nier automata is probably nier replicant. There is nothing like it in the gaming market.
Overwatch,fl0cd87,t1_fl0azm0,1584701167.0,There is no limit to damage stacking
OverwatchLeague,fjtfbnu,t1_fjrrxuu,1583607256.0,"Yes, but the issue is that Orisa is trash and without her he is useless. He should never be blamed for her being broken imo."
Competitiveoverwatch,fjm0i76,t3_fdwdp7,1583458763.0,"This isn't the first time that someone leaks a november or something release. Some teams leaked it on twitter, it was also leaked by the BR playstation page on FB etc..."

depression,fjlzjgq,t1_fjlkiei,1583458125.0,Easier said than done. Just until the bad episode of bipolar disorder kicks in and you're redeemed useless for the next days.
depression,fjlyox1,t1_fjjxstc,1583457559.0,"Because most of us need some sort of self esteem boost to do so. If a girl finds us attractive then that helps so much you have no idea.

Competitiveoverwatch,fjipoe0,t3_fdfk2s,1583372921.0,by far the worst meta that ever happened imo.
Overwatch,fj9jvtu,t1_fj969to,1583151232.0,Nothing. One sombra would hack the other sombra that should have gotten the potg.
titanfolk,fj9ijhd,t1_fj7n0e7,1583149812.0,"If thats the case then Eren can possibly be the father alright. Would make sense for after he giving her the tip of getting pregnant, so she wouldnt eat Zeke until the childs birth. After saying that, she chooses him to be the father giving he is her closest friend and all."
Competitiveoverwatch,fj9gvjb,t1_fj8ru0w,1583147894.0,It will matter you will see. They will find another comp that will make her busted in it.
Competitiveoverwatch,fj931fr,t1_fj8x9d1,1583130257.0,Out of 5 variarions you mentioned 3 have Genji in it. i see you are a person of culture aswell.

Competitiveoverwatch,fi3d791,t1_fi31hnp,1582112514.0,"The issue is that other tanks are weak due to other factors. Winston and Hammond are trashed by Mei, Reaper and the healing creep in the game. Hog is just a fat DPS that brings no utility to his teammates and Orisa and Sigma are trashed cause they need to find a way to make them good without becoming TOO good together. Double shield was by far the worst meta ive ever played after Bunker. Getting locked in an Orisa for 6 months was super frustrating."

GenjiMains,ffzw5xn,t1_ffz4b1y,1580394464.0,I heard the issue is not only that. Looks like some players have a playstyle that applies pressure on the mouse which combined with wrist aim causes carpal tunnel.
Competitiveoverwatch,ffzpwzb,t1_ffzjekm,1580389383.0,Because in the same statement he confirmed that 1-3-2 aint coming. They just learned some stuff with the testing that made the game feel much better and are implementing it to 2-2-2
Overwatch,ffwmvtl,t3_evge32,1580305836.0,nobody will mention that Mei ulted after over half her team was dead?
titanfolk,ffuwtza,t1_ffrsi2v,1580250855.0,I understand.
