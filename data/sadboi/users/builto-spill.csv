I know I'm not getting a full picture of your lives, but you sound way more shitty (not necessarily narcissist) than him. 

In regards to your point #3 and his lack of empathy, towards you and your grief via comparing it or w/e to  *""trivial""* things such as job rejections???? Wtf. Job rejections fucking suck. Just because you're suffering doesn't mean they're not allowed to suffer. 

You sound like a huge buzzkill on your bday. He was probably too ashamed and embarassed to cancel plans with your guys' mutual friends because you hurt your foot. Unless the doctor instructed you to stay home for x amount of days, I feel you should at least make an appearance. Yes, it's *your* special day but people probably had to move their schedules around to plan to go and they also probably wanted to celebrate your birthday with you cuz idk, those fun days are also about your loved ones too. And he was your literal crutch all night??? That's cute AF. That doesn't sound like a sign of NPD, that sounds like a frustrated boyfriend trying to make you and X amount of people happy when you're not cooperating.

And omg I gotta wrap this up, but lastly, HES FINE WITH YOU HAVING ANOTHER LONG TERM BOYFRIEND!? Does he also have other girlfriends!? Wtf he'd better, otherwise it's obvious he's just starting to resent you for cuckholding him . 

Just because you took the time to spell check and format this to make it look fancy only makes you pretentious, not credible. Stop projecting yourself onto him. Either get some couples counseling or leave him smh"

But seriously, if you're going to date someone you believe to be NPD, make sure you have very clear and strong boundaries. Having bpd, we struggle with boundaries so much already, and while every NPD is not the same and they're sometimes actually awesome, I feel it is good practice to be very cautious. Do not fall head over heels in love at first sight. Take things slow. Be smart. Do not share private information about yourself and your loved ones until a level of trust is established. If you feel like some red flags are appearing and you find yourself ""splitting"", just trust your instincts and don't blame the BPD.

Though, I feel these are just general good dating tips. But like... Be really firm and honest with yourself during the relationship."

It also kind of cracks me up, because the 'empaths' all think they're blameless victims who have never harmed a fly in their lives. Yet, because of their negative experiences with their shitty parents or their jerk off boyfriends that they chose to stay with despite the 'abuse' (and I'm sure the majority of them are diagnosed by the 'victim'), these empaths decide that every single NDP is exactly the same. Then, they come into NDP's boards and fucking abuse everyone! 

This makes me laugh because singling out an entire group of people as subhuman is basically racism.

So, by following their black and white logic, I conclude that 100% of the victimed empaths are evil racists."

NPD,fdop5wv,t1_fdom3le,1578609764.0,"So, what if a narcissist devoted their lives to helping the homeless, using cognitive empathy to helping people in need by using a logical and rational approach, and didn't bully and intimidate people solely because it's not socially acceptable? 

If a narcissist was doing all these good things and helped so many people, but their intention for it was simply so they'd be seen and viewed as a wonderful person by the outside world, are they still considered a bad person to you? 

Keep in mind, you are not a mind reader, thus you are not aware of the thoughts in NDP's head. 

Sometimes I feel like a main difference between narcs and neurotypicals is their intention. NTs might do kind gestures to other people because they want to make that person happy. Narcs can do the same thing for that person, only the difference is that they are doing it to make themselves happy. At the end of the day, the same good deed was done, just for different reasons. 

Same can be said for bad deeds as well. An NT might cheat on their partner because they were were extremely attracted to the side-person and wanted to share their love with them, too. A narc might cheat on their partner because they wanted to make themselves feel good. 

The same bad deed happened, just for different reasons ü§∑.

All I'm saying is that there's good and bad people everywhere. Not every single narcissistic is a terrible person. Just as every single empath certainly isn't a saint."
BPD,fdoik69,t3_emf70y,1578605862.0,"Lol, I had the same issue with a previous bf around the three year mark when I was 23. I was super chill for the first two years about his social life, then all of a sudden I was like ""If you hang out with friends without me, it obviously means it's because you don't like me and I bet you all make fun of me behind my back. Then you'll meet some hotter chick and leave me."" Idk that lasted for about 8 months then I moved onto some different obsession. 


Honestly, I'd reccomend trying to find any hobby that you feel may fulfill yourself. I got into creative writing after being with him for several years and it was amazing for helping the symptoms of BPD. I had so much fun writing, I started not even caring about being abandoned because I realized being alone has its perks too. 

Not saying a hobby can actually replace an SO or FP or whatever. But it did help me get into the mindset of ""MEH, if I end up alone, at least I can just pursue this in all my free time and put all my effort towards getting published.""
