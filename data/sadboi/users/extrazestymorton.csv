popping,fqc9rd1,t1_fqc34aw,1589253140.0,I second this!!! Life changing I swear!!
tonsilstones,fpuh7xy,t3_gf9223,1588912824.0,Yessss
tonsilstones,fpp6b9f,t3_gejabb,1588796718.0,Can someone explain how to properly use them? Just ordered them and haven’t been able to get anything out
tonsilstones,fpp68vm,t3_genqep,1588796685.0,Blackhead extractor or q tip or pencil
tonsilstones,fpmuoda,t3_gdogzg,1588742213.0,Try a blackhead extractor - I use the bigger end and scoop inside my tonsils
tonsilstones,fpdu2gx,t3_gcwglx,1588534239.0,I haven’t done this but sounds like it’s definitely irritated and could easily get infected until it’s all healed up. Gargle warm salt water to make sure you’re keeping it clean! :)
tonsilstones,fpafdgf,t3_gcc37z,1588447015.0,**find
tonsilstones,fp95fwv,t3_gc1e08,1588415060.0,Have you tried to poke them?
tonsilstones,fp8851p,t1_fp7wam8,1588385917.0,Good to know!! I get tons of tiny ones as well but I was fearful I may not be digging deep enough or something to get the whole thing out.
tonsilstones,fp6whl0,t3_gbjdr7,1588359796.0,Looks normal to me!
tonsilstones,fp4xpwx,t3_gba6it,1588310191.0,Holy moly! That’s huge!
tonsilstones,fp2g5xp,t3_gapcz4,1588261191.0,It looks like it! :(
tonsilstones,fp2fb8j,t3_garlcm,1588260775.0,I believe so because mine are worse right now than ever.
tonsilstones,fp0r7d9,t3_gampo3,1588215129.0,Ugh I’ve been going through the same with allergies lately!! Glad you finally have relief :)
tonsilstones,fom5twm,t3_g81ujx,1587879171.0,Same but I have a hard time getting mine out so I’m just constantly obsessing and poking around with no luck most times
tonsilstones,fom5hv2,t3_g84ex0,1587878897.0,How do you use your finger? Are you able to see yours beforehand or do you have to squeeze. ?
tonsilstones,fojgo0n,t3_g7t9h0,1587820377.0,How??
tonsilstones,fo8iaay,t3_g5ttha,1587597092.0,How’d you get it?
tonsilstones,fo8i9fj,t3_g601ht,1587597078.0,How did you do it??
depression,fntadxb,t3_g3ljni,1587237719.0,I never really think of it that way- but that’s a good point. I always guilt trip myself so much & they’re doing the same thing.
tonsilstones,fngdjh8,t3_g0tb5w,1586928979.0,How did you know where to dig around to find them? I’m having such a hard time but I know they’re in there somewhere.
tonsilstones,fn512dy,t1_fn4ywi4,1586653425.0,Thank you! I’ll give that a try :)
tonsilstones,fn48urk,t3_fzeo0h,1586636420.0,How did you do it? I can never get the Q-tip method to work for me but I know they’re in there!!
