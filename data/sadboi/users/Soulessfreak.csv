SuicideWatch,flo2heu,t1_flnamsn,1585330402.0,I get that thought. I’ve been there. But you have to cling to the thought that you can make yourself remembered. And you will make yourself remembered. Just push through these sad feelings. It will get better. I promise. You’ve already made one leap. Because I will remember you. So make me remember you because You were strong. Because you were a fighter. And you made it better for yourself. If you do that step alone I’ll remember you as being brave. And hopeful. And that is awesome.
SuicideWatch,flmwn56,t1_flmwfd3,1585299798.0,Thank you. Not going to lie this made me smile. And not the fake smile I put on around people. I’ll try to be a little more optimistic.
SuicideWatch,flmw3pz,t1_flmvz1z,1585299132.0,But isn’t the main goal in life to be happy? Everything to me just feels so dull. Pointless. Unenjoyable. I don’t know how to describe it. I wake up in the morning go to school go to baseball practice come home repeat. No one to hug me. No one to love me. Just me. Alone.
SuicideWatch,flmvnx0,t3_fpr465,1585298598.0,I’ve come to realize that the point of life varies for each person. I couldn’t tell you what the true point of life is but I can tell you what I found to believe is my personal purpose in life. I believe that my purpose is to leave a legacy. I mean whenever I feel sad or want to end it I think “is this how I want to be remembered?” And I start to think and I realize that I don’t want to be remembered for something bad. I want to be remembered for something good. Something that helped someone else. I want to die knowing I was useful one way or another. Not to die because I “couldn’t handle it”. I want my final thought to be that I don’t regret a thing. I want to go out in a fiery ball of epic ness. I want to be remembered. And I want it to be for something good.
