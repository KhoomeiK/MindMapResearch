mentalhealth,fm8r466,t3_ftepzi,1585854459.0,"I think this is going to be a huge issue. In the last two weeks, I have considered doing it countless times. I am INCREDIBLY lucky to have a friend who not only understands but has ben there each and every time to save me from myself, not only then but even before. That guy is the reason my parents still have a daughter. Just remember that this is going to end. I read somewhere that butterflies aren't always butterflies, first, they are caterpillars, and then go into a cocoon, which is essentially putting them in isolation, before coming out as a butterfly. I think that this might be a good way to look at this, and try to get out of this stronger than before."
Anxietyhelp,fkdxjy0,t3_fhrnur,1584099060.0,"Honestly, for me, it can be both. Sometimes it is triggered by something, sometimes it just comes for no reason. What I'm learning to do is, if it is obvious that I am not in immediate danger because of my surroundings (aka always), I don't try to find a trigger, because that just makes it worse. hope you get a therapist soon!"
