Look, I used to think Rick Berman was a good influence on science fiction.  What he did with Star Trek through three shows was great.  But it only worked because he was always moving forward in time; and he was Gene Roddenberry's picked successor, the man who understood the source more than anyone.  

Once you lost that, the ""cult of canon"" became a burden, and in that case it's better to go with the Leiji Matsumoto approach where you just say to hell with continuity and use characters as need be to tell a story.

Ah.

Okay.  So you're looking to be away from progressives then.

Well, for starters, Iowa City.  Avoid that.  They're called *The People's Republic of Johnson County* and they really are that bad.  Frankly, they're worse than that bad.  The University of Iowa is more progressive than the worst bicoastal progressives, because HERE they have a persecution complex.

Setting Iowa City aside, let's run down the remainder.

**Des Moines** - Two big industries, insurance and manufacturing.  Lots of high paying office jobs to be had, and the progressives are largely contained to the East Village.  

**Quad Cities** - Rougher city than most in Iowa, pretty bad alcohol and drug addiction problem.  Heavy on manufacturing. 

**Cedar Rapids** - Also manufacturing heavy although not as poor as QC.  There are two cereal plants, an ethanol plant and a corn syrup plant in CR, so there are a couple very intense plumes of grain dryer odor through the city.

**Waterloo / Cedar Falls** - This one has a dual identity.  Waterloo is dominated by the tractor factory and doesn't have much going for it on its own, while Cedar Falls hosts the University of Northern Iowa.

**Ames** - Ames hosts Iowa State University and has a massive hateboner for U-Iowa, to the extent of basically the entire community defining themselves by how they're not Iowa City.  Where Iowa City is full of poser progressives and environmentalists who talk big and accomplish little, Ames runs a powerplant and burns its trash for power.  Where Iowa City has four ineffectual bus systems that step on each other (ICT, Cambus, Coralville, JC Seats), Ames has exactly one (CyRide) that is actually pretty good at getting you anywhere.  In the time that Iowa City has gone through 3 malls and gutted its downtown retail, Ames still has exactly 1 mall, the only mall its ever had, and its downtown is still thriving.  The only caveat is that Ames also hosts the National Animal Research Labs, which means the whole town is one biosafety accident away from *Raccoon City* or *The Rats of NIMH*.

**Council Bluffs** - Not a lot going on here, CB is just a suburb of Omaha.

All other towns not mentioned can be basically fit into one of five profiles:

* First Rate Town: Built a mall in the 60's to 80's, gutted their downtown to do it.  Will have a Walmart and a hospital.  Example: Knoxville, Fort Dodge.
* Second Rate Town: Didn't build a mall so the downtown didn't die, still got a Walmart.  Generally looks nicer than a First Rate due to dodging the mall bullet.  May or may not have a proper hospital, at least has an urgent care center.  Example: Independence, Pella.
* Third Rate Town: Never built a hospital.  No Walmart due to lowish population.  Largest employer is likely one factory, second largest employer is probably the school district which likely serves a very large area.  Downtown still kinda nice if it's a touristy area.  Examples: Amana (touristy), Bell Plaine (not touristy)
* Fourth Rate Town: Has a Casey's.  No school district, kids bus to nearby 3rd Rate.
* Fifth Rate Town: No Casey's.  Employment is zero, basically just a cluster of houses around an elevator and a church."

Jann partnered with Largo is the best lancer in the game.  Way better than Largo; give Largo a mortar for cleanup and let Jann pick off the tanks.

Dallas has the best set of engineer potentials; double action has a higher proc rate than invincible, and while Nadine has it too the rest of her slate is just bad.  Dallas was practically MADE for supporting a scout rush with Alicia and Juno."

If you find yourself wondering where G-Reco stand in terms of power level, ask yourself why you aren't asking the same question about Mobile Fighter or Turn A.  If that doesn't give you enough of an answer, then just draw another box on the power level chart, label it Tomino, and drop everything dubious in there because Tomino doesn't care."

Don't try it in Kerbal tho cuz the physics are sufficiently complicated that KSP doesn't implement them.

Luna is sufficiently big relative to Earth that the Earth-Luna points are usable.  The Sol-Jupiter points are quite strong, and asteroids are known to exist in the Sol-Jupiter L4 and L5, the largest of which is Hektor at 200+ km diameter (and known to have its OWN satellite, the 12 km Skamandrios)."

Char knows how to be two things, a fighter and a leader, and he doesn't want to lead.

He's hiding in his life as a pilot, because it's the only other thing he has.

There's a lot of easily overlooked moments in Zeta, but one in particular is when Kamille confronts Char and says ""I won't call you Quattro anymore.""  *I'm not gonna play along with your self loathing.*  Kamille the emotional child, chewing out grown-ass man Char to grow up and be what he was born to be."
Gundam,fpqg4t0,t1_fpqejb2,1588822031.0,"Somewhere between AGE and G-Reco there's a happy medium.

AGE had a predictable plot and unlikable characters.  G-Reco had great characters but the plot was a few weeks off its meds.  

The mecha in G-Reco feels like a crazy experiment that didn't go as planned.  The mecha in AGE feels like putting in just enough effort to not flunk.

G-Reco has an atmosphere of mad energy, like it's more a spiritual sequel to Overman King Gainer than Turn A *(which it actually kinda is if you look at the names Tomino brought in to help)*.  AGE feels like watching a really halfhearted opera of Hamlet that's being carried entirely by the orchestra."

One thing I like to point out is that when Bright threatens the brass at Cheyenne in Unicorn, this isn't a mere captain saying he'll go rogue.

Bright, as leader of Londo Bell, is the de facto commander in chief of the forces of an entire colony (Londenion).  Their loyalty to the EFSF proper is skin deep.  If Bright decides Earth is the enemy, he has at least as much support as Char had from Sweetwater.  Londenion fields a good sized fleet of their own types of ships separate from the EFSF, with their own advanced MS.

This is basically how the Federation is after the Gryps War.  A bunch of Sengoku-era style warlords showing nominal fealty while maintaining their own armies."

The Gundam designs are a little too brazenly taking the First-Zeta-Double-Counterattack progression, and the Federation grunt designs all look like they flunked the casting call for Iron Blooded Orphans (remarkable considering IBO came later).

And Flit comes off as autistically obsessive that he's genocidal about the death of one girl he knew for a few minutes decades ago.

It's a series based off a game, and frankly, it LOOKS like a series based off a game."
