“There have in fact been hundreds of scientific publications spanning well over a century documenting how the memory of trauma can be repressed, only to resurface years or decades later. Memory loss has been reported in people who have experienced natural disasters, accidents, war trauma, kidnapping, torture, concentration camps, and physical and sexual abuse. Total memory loss is most common in childhood sexual abuse, with incidence ranging from 19% to 38%. This issue is not particularly controversial: as early as 1980 the DSM-III recognize the existence of memory loss for traumatic events and the diagnostic criteria for dissociative amnesia: ‘an inability to recall important personal information, usually over traumatic or stressful nature, that is too extensive to be explained by normal forgetfulness.’ Memory loss has been part of the criteria for PTSD since that diagnosis was introduced.”

I see some threads between our personal histories, but I’m 26. Only recently did I realize this, but my first hallucination happened when I was 15. I was nervous, sitting in advanced biology class, and someone left a sink running nearby; I was certain the sound of running water was going to enter my head and kill me, but I felt completely paralyzed and had a silent panic attack with my head down on my desk instead. When I looked up at the whiteboard—still absolutely sure the watery ear-worm was going to obliterate me—my vision went red. That still happens sometimes when I look at white or bright things too suddenly.

ACV as a leave-in will smell until it dries, so you can’t use much, and you have to cover it up with a better smell, hence the addition of the lavender oil. 

Think about your conditioner label. Glycerin comes from many natural sources because triglycerides are derived from animals or vegetables. A couple of vegetable sources are coconut oil and shea butter. The vegetable glycerin I got is the cheap USP kind from the Hispanic health section at Walmart and no sources are listed on the label, but it’s probably derived from palm or soybean oil. I’m indifferent because it works, but if I developed allergies I might care. If I’m making it, I tend not to care about my concoction’s base. I do tend to get organic essential oils though, since there’s less of a price discrepancy between those and generic. 

I would make roughly 1c vegetable glycerin, 1tsp vinegar, and two drops lavender oil, and I keep it in the original bottle, but you can repackage it if you’re organized or care about that sort of thing."

AmItheAsshole,fp1ebpt,t1_fp1e7s1,1588232675.0,"I grew up on a farm. I took a class on animal science. That bull didn’t learn how to seduce for whatever reason so he never got it in. Simple as that.

My granddad would have shit himself before admitting his cows could be gay. It might have more to do with the release of oestrus when a bull reaches sexual maturity. If that doesn’t happen because there are no females around to go in heat, or a heifer/cow’s/s’ health and nutrition are off, or the bull’s brain doesn’t recognize the slight whiff of cow pheromones, the young bull does not learn how to mate. Have you seen bulls or animals part their lips and sniff the air? That’s called “flehmen.”

People study neurobiology in cattle but neurobiologists don’t even fully understand how our own brains work. How can we infer how a bull thinks? What he likes? What kind of udder really turns him on? Maybe he turns out to be gay because he just doesn’t recognize beauty in long cow eyelashes. We all have our preferences.

But I’m going to hypothesize it’s a learned behavior in either the absence or misrecognition of a cow’s sexy fragrance. I’d like to take it a step further and address bovine identity politics, but no. Then I’d just be a quirky and very pretentious farm girl. 

[Bulling is just a primer for how to alter the social hierarchy](http://www.animalbehaviour.net/cattle/), especially when there’s a food shortage:

“In free-range heterosexual herds of cattle there are several hierarchies among adult males, adult females and juveniles. As they age, young males fight adult females and eventually dominate them.

The hierarchy tends to be linear and large herds probably break down into a series of smaller hierarchies (Hafez and Bouisson, 1975). There is evidence that dominance hierarchies in young beef steers are formed soon after weaning and that they remain stable even when the groups are moved to other pens (Stricklin et al., 1980). Dominance and eating behaviour have been observed in beef cattle where only one animal at a time could eat, and it was found that high-ranking cattle had fewer meals but tended to spend more time per day eating. Also dominant cattle did not prevent subordinates from gaining access to the stall, and the lower-ranking cattle replaced higher-ranking cattle as frequently asthey were replaced by higher ranking cattle. Dominance becomes important only when there is a very limited amount of food for which to compete (Stricklin & Gonyou, 1981).”"

Vindicta,fonlson,t1_foi8pg9,1587921954.0,"Absolutely. I’ve experimented with supplements, vitamins, diets, and herbs for seven years now. A good multivitamin is necessary for most women. Liver supplements and cleanses have been a godsend for me. You can get your metabolism going with green coffee bean extract. If you are desperate and diet, supplements, exercise, and your mental health are failing you, try going prescription free and take Hydroxycut. Start with a small dose; that stuff is powerful. It will level out all your problem areas if you’ve been struggling, in most cases. But like I said, be careful with it. Take it early in the day and drink lots of water. Even if your body doesn’t seem to want water, drink water. Always sip on water or coffee (my favorite is cold brew with coconut milk) or detox teas. As for diet, eat healthy meats and fats and lots and lots of veggies. I love chicken, beef, duck fat, poached eggs, and especially lamb. I also love kombucha and green smoothies and totally overindulge in nice beverages. I make my own kombucha and yogurt and get fresh foods from roadside stands when I can.

Vindicta,fnn6ww4,t3_g2rp68,1587085727.0,"There are things you can do for your skin and hopefully that will improve your appearance and confidence a bit as a result. Not only are there topical treatments for it—you can get to the root of your problem, usually health-related, and treat your acne that way too. I fixed my acne by drinking lots of water on a regular basis and taking milk thistle and a solid multivitamin to correct the root problem, a hormonal imbalance. Exercise seemed to help a lot too. 

Something really interesting I used to look into was Chinese face mapping. There’s a theory in TCM that the location of acne on your face (or even body) will point to a certain part of your system that is struggling. For example, acne on your nose might indicate a liver problem. Give it a search on images if you’re curious. 

As for oily skin, I had the best results in improving my skin through oil cleansing in the shower and using a witch hazel toner. You can experiment with different regimens... I go between daily surface cleansing and an occasional face wash followed up by toner, moisturizer, and serum now. You just need to experiment to see what works for your skin. Like I’ve gotten way more into skin care in the last couple years and now do weekly peels and masks, gua sha, and generally some form of nightly treatment. There’s so much you can learn and try. Clay masks are basically my holy grail; do not underestimate the power of masks. 

As for the rest of your appearance, you can try researching orthotropics. And if you hate your nose that much, maybe consult with a plastic surgeon eventually depending on your age, finances, etc. Falsies might also help you. But I like the last part of what you said..at the end of the day, you just have to come to terms with what God gave you."

AskWomen,flazqb0,t3_fnjuxv,1584994417.0,I was looking at a French painting of a young girl—can’t remember who did it—and feeling very lonely so I suddenly pulled out my watercolors. [This girl](https://www.instagram.com/p/BZM67jqHp74/?igshid=1imhlgbu7fe21)  is my favorite piece I’ve ever done. Her expression makes me feel happy inside!

schizophrenia,fl1p8uw,t3_flkplq,1584733490.0,"I have read that too. My age of onset was probably 17-18. Everything just got really bad at 21—I had my first psychotic episode for a few weeks. Before that, I had what I termed “visions”, started isolating beyond my introverted tendencies, and thought lights and plants were communicating with me. There were some other things too but I never thought anything of them until after going down the rabbit hole. 

As a child I do remember talking to plants, but it was fictive then; I would imagine how they would respond. As a psychotic adult, the trees and shrubs would have faces and tell me I “must fulfill my duty to 42” or some other nonsense."
