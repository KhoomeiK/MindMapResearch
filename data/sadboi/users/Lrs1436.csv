chat,fmyav5x,t3_ful28l,1586481921.0,"I feel like such a minority when I tell myself how much I'm enjoying this time. I'm WFH and being able to do other tasks during the work day in between, rather than rushing home after a full day of work and cramming necessary things in a couple hours before bed has been amazing. My mental health and physical health have improved. And who doesn't want to spend the day with their pup all the time.

I'm not looking forward to returning to the rat race after all this. I'm trying to soak up every second. Getting to enjoy hobbies and relax at a slower pace. 

It's sad that it took this type of devestating event to experience this. And obviously there are 100s of thousands of people who are on the very opposite spectrum or have no choice but to report in to work. So I'm not trying to negate their experiences. I'm very fortunate."

There’s patient phone on the unit they could’ve used all day...or they wait until 5min before I leave and mention something that changes their entire discharge plan.

And while this isn’t a last minute request, it’s certainly recurrent: having to take verbal abuse from patients because they’re mad about things I have no control over but I’m just available to them on the unit."
socialwork,ewsqhp9,t1_ew9mwx2,1565733090.0,"Being at a psych hospital, we aren’t allowed to discharge to the streets.

socialwork,ewsq5fu,t1_ew9fmsy,1565732873.0,"I too work at a hospital. I get patients all the time saying they lied about being suicidal in order to come inpatient because they want housing. They aren’t happy when I tell them that we’re a hospital and so therefore, we do not provide or find housing.

This includes the family members who when we call say, they need housing, or they need ‘structured housing’, I.e. if the patient stuck to a schedule and kept busy they’d be alright. They don’t like it either when I tell them the secret....it doesn’t exist. (Unless of course you’re  very mentally Ill and we’re talking about CRR or LTSR)"
rant,evhunxn,t3_cjz8cv,1564532444.0,You deserve to fight it. You took the oath. You followed your orders. You made a mistake. One that you state you regret and didn’t think was wrong from the get go as you left the important piece in the office to just repair “the shell”. If you fight your discharge statute what’s the worst that’ll happen? It won’t change. Sounds like you’ve been in tougher situations. Wish you the best. And I don’t want this sounding hollow and robotic but- Thank you for your service.

Today a family blamed me for their kid being discharged from his 302 court hearing. Even though I told the family I have no involvement in anything with the court. And my supervisor did nothing to back me up because it was the end of day and she wanted to get home 🙄

socialwork,eroehw5,t3_c27ad7,1561076842.0,"In my hospital the nurses tend to complain a lot more, and more openly to whom ever’s around to hear. They definitely show signs of burnout. But it’s frustrating to hear the complaining daily because they get better pay than the social worker department and they have a union that supports them. So for us in social work who are constantly frustrated with doctors, outpatient agencies, and having to cohesively work with our units/treatment teams/and the patients, it adds on me personally to my frustrations and feelings of burn out.
To add..the SW dept has poor support and the hospital as a whole doesn’t understand from the higher up positions what all our departments deal with on a daily basis on the actual units so That of course adds to it all."
