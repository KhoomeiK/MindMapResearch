ASP is a preprocessor. The problem with it was that everyone write code where the logic was scattered throughout the HTML page. You see the same problem in old PHP sites (heck, you still see it in PHP code where they put all the logic in the view side). 

If an ASP site was written cleanly, they’d write the code in such a way that the logic was encapsulated in an include file, and the HTML was mostly clean, with a few ASP constructs to loop through results, etc. 

One of the other MAJOR problems with classic ASP is that there was no concept of SQL injection prevention. Even PHP has had mysql_escape() for eons, but it was never built into ASP, and loads of old ASP code was insanely insecure because of it."

My wife was under 8-12 hours each time (4 surgeries totaling 40 hours) in 6 months, plus about 2 dozen minor procedures requiring anesthesia in the same time. It took years to fully recover from all that anesthesia. She’s had a few additional procedures over the years, but nothing nearly as bad as that, fortunately."
history,fmghlbg,t1_fmecu99,1586049236.0,I’m sorry she has to go through that. I have a friend who’s wife has to go through dozens of those a year and it’s definitely not anything I’d wish on anyone (or the conditions that require it). Best wishes to your family.

history,fmeb9ih,t1_fmdxbje,1585997290.0,"I won’t say it’s immediate recovery. Anesthesia messes with you, especially long surgeries. My wife “lost” several days after each of her surgeries, and it took a long time for her to get her short term memory back to normal."

AskReddit,fkbuwe2,t3_fhlleb,1584040342.0,One of the girls in the class below me had an affair her senior year with the social studies teacher and they got married after she graduated. (Needless to say his wife left him). As far as I know they’re still married. They’ve got a ton of kids last I heard.

AskReddit,fk9ob19,t3_fh95db,1583980015.0,"It’s spread two ways. One is through coughing etc, but that is limited by distance, covering your mouth etc.

The second way is through not washing your hands (either after coughing/sneezing into your hands, or after using the toilet). So, say someone else doesn’t wash their hands, then touches something that you then touch. Then you touch a mucosal area (eyes/nose/mouth). Bang, you have a good chance of being infected."
minimalist,fk7d7to,t3_efz61h,1583933919.0,"One thing I’ll say too is look for manual versions of the big tools that can go in a drawer. For example, we occasionally make veggie noodles. When we lived in a mobile home, we simply didn’t have the counter space. Instead of buying one of those countertop noodle making thingies, I bought a small hand operated one. It sits in a drawer, and when we use it (about once a month) it does what it’s intended to. If I’m going to chop, dice, mince, slice or whatever else, I either use a knife or I have a small mandolin (again, not a big slicing monster) that sits next to the pots in the cabinet."

webdev,fk52qy9,t1_fk50kjv,1583872344.0,It sounds like you may not be breaking it down enough. Your mind is still thinking about the problem and not the implementation.
