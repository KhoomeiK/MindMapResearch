I took 50 for about a week and I honestly felt better with just 25 so I went back to that. It‚Äôs been about a week since I backed down again and I‚Äôm feeling good. I take it for anxiety and ptsd and it‚Äôs been a game changer for me. My favorite thing about it at this point is my ability to connect with myself when I‚Äôm emotional, and control how I react. It‚Äôs insane. I‚Äôm 33 years old and have never felt this way. 

My main side effect is sweaty hands and feet, which has actually been a plus because my feet are normally dry and cracky, but right now they look the best they have in over a decade. I also feel slightly blunted emotionally, (especially with 50mg, which is the main reason I wanted to go back down) but like I said, being an overly emotional person this is a welcomed relief.

Ive pulled out the worms I‚Äôm able to see on the fish that are visibly infected. I‚Äôve also dabbed their wounds with peroxide and will continue to do that for the next five days or so. 

I‚Äôve ordered a medication called Cyromazine and I plan to start that once it arrives. I want to get that in the tank and then begin the tedious process of sanitizing the tank. I‚Äôm not entirely sure if that‚Äôs the correct order. Should I quarantine them with medication and sanitize everything while that‚Äôs happening, or go ahead and add the meds to the tank first? I will have to get a quarantine tank because I don‚Äôt have that yet. 

Is there a way to sanitize the plants I have in there, or should I just get new ones? 

Anything I‚Äôm missing? Having fish was not an intentional hobby I started, I just kind of fell into it because I rescued some little ones about a year ago. I didn‚Äôt/don‚Äôt understand a lot of what goes into keeping them. This is the first time anything has gone awry but dammit I love my little brood of fluttery beauties and I want them to live healthy happy lives. 

One thing is for absolute certain and that is that if I ever get another fish it will be in quarantine for two weeks before adding to the main tank!"
