Sadly we are much more informed, globally, on different presentations of physical injuries than we are informed on even the myriad of normal emotional responses to trauma. Although she may not be a textbook case, I'm betting they were trained to treat all similar cases in the same textbook manner. So I suppose I can understand where the nurses are coming from moreso than the motives of Kelley herself, which is a truth I will take gracefully. 

I don't want to know whatever pain Kelley has known that led her to do this in the first place, and I wish she never knew it either - or at the very least that she had gotten the help she desperately needed immediately and not after the self mutilation already began to take hold."

Drugs,fqeg5yf,t3_gi9jb2,1589307006.0,"I've experienced ego death on shrooms and consider myself a psychonaut. That ego death feeling can have lasting POSITIVE change - IF ONE PUTS IN THE WORK!

Integrating the ego death experience is hard and has left many people including myself feeling a lot of self loathing when the ego fuel returns. Then users can try to combat this and say ""yeah? Well no I learned so much during ego death and still have the knowledge... so I'm definitely better for it as I speak!"" 

It can make things worse for a person if they aren't able to work towards making those positive ego death thoughts of love and connection real through action they take daily, no exceptions. 

The idea is the ego must die over and over, and the work is never done. The goal is to be able to giggle at the ego when it resurrects itself, commit to ignoring its whispers into your ear, and taking action that shows the ego you won't be following its whims. It's a lesson of self control and in my opinion the first ego death is only the start of inner change. A person must follow up with what they learned - when people assume they will remain as they felt during ego death without putting work in, they end up how you described."
