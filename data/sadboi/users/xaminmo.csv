A plastic-wrapped bit of meat still has the germs in it from before slaughter.  Canned meat kills the germs, is sealed well, and likely contains preservatives that prevent bacterial growth.

Cured meat is dried and preserved, so bacteria cannot grow.  For exsmple, pancetta is a type of bacon that can last months.

There’s also “meals ready to eat” which are sterilized, preserved, and sealed in thick plastic.  They can last decades.

As a kid, we’d buy fresh meat, sealed in thick, clear plastic, and irradiated before sale.  It was shelf stable until the seal was broken.  The plastic kept bacteria out, snd the irradiation destroyed the DNA, so anything inside was dead."

Everyone has poop on their hands.  Randomly, when people talk, cough, or sneeze, poop particles come out.  You don't know who does this.  It's invisible.  It can even be you, spraying poop particles on people and surfaces.

Please act accordingly, and understand that some people will actively try to spread poop on others because it's funny to them;  Some people won't care;  Some people won't believe it is real;  Some people will be careful;  And lastly, some people will be way more cautious than you want or expect.

Try to stay calm, cool, and collected, but also try to be respectful of other peoples' need to not be covered in poop spray.  If you cover someone, it doesn't matter if it's real or not.  You're being rude, and will be seen as actively attacking people.  They will have the right to protect themselves.

""But xaminmo, it's not poop!""

Wrong.  The ONLY reason poop is gross is because of the germs.  The smell?  germs.  The risk of illness?  Germs.  Otherwise, it's just dirt, wood pulp, and food oil.  Well, remove the parts that don't gross you out or make you sick, and you're left with invisible germs, and tiny bits of water, and all of the hazards.

It is still poop.

It's always been this way.  It's not new.  It's just that it's not every day that a new germ comes along that has any serious risk.  But we know, wash our food.  e.coli is bad.  Clean your hands after going to the bathroom.  Well, now those germs come out of anywhere you have an opening, not just your lower half.  It's gross.  Don't be gross.

Don't be those people like in my neighborhood who decided ""Oh, it's all over, let's have a party so big that there are car accidents, blocked roads, police, and tow trucks all within an hour, and we'll have only one person wearing a mask when they drop off their kid.""

It's not over.  People just got so tired of being bored that they are willing to kill or be killed.  The risk is acceptable to them, but they are not being safe enough to protect the people who do not accept that risk.

So, keep cleaning your door knobs, washing your produce, wiping down your packages and canned foods.  Keep wearing a mask to block spittle, and if you can, wash, sanitize, or replace it after every time you change locations, or any time you notice you've been messing with it with your hands."

The crazy thing is, after a month of no food, having a big meal or two will kill you.  The body builds up growth hormone, and the increase of food causes rapid growth and repair.  

Your body runs out of phosphorous and calcium, so you stop producing ATP, and muscles stop receiving the release signal.  

Muscles normally contract and release constantly, so muscles start cramping, including cardiac muscle.  

But, by that point, the person is delerious, because the brain is also starved of fuel.

Fed a carefully constructed diet of 500 calories per day, with minerals, vitamins, fiber, protein, and fat, the body can be sustained until around a BMI of 12, where people tend to suffer hypothermia, and multiple organ failure.

At the instant of bang, that is when space, time, mass, and energy all came to be something.

The universe has expanded enough that we have what we have now.  Like anything in our universe, decrease pressure decreases heat.

Except, the matter in the universe is not moving away from some central point.  The universe itself is expanding.  SPACE and time are expanding.  Matter and energy keep space condensed, but thise big, open areas have so little mass/energy that the space between things is expanding.

So, the edge of the “observable” universe is getting further away from us at the same rate as light can travel through space, but it’s not moving at the speed of light.  The expansion is slow, there’s just a lot of it to expand.  The edge of the observable universe from our position is a better description, and that is as far away from us (in every direction) as light could travel since the beginning of time.

If you could instantly appear somewhere along the edge of the observable universe, then you would have a new area of observable universe.  It’s not an empty void.  It’s thought to be more of the same."
AskReddit,fllb3l0,t3_fp7eni,1585256955.0,"Enterprise Information Technology health assessments.  I have to be in just the right mindset, so it ends up being one of those night urgent/late things.  

I’m great at looking at things, and seeing dependencies, and how they can lead to failure of operation, performance, or expected function.  As long as I’m not distracted, I can grapple with all of the details for all of the pieces across all of the business units, departments, systems, components, etc.  Invariably, there is info no one knows anymore, so I go figure that out and recreate the missing data as long as I’m given access or authority to create access.

I’m extremely detail oriented, and once I finish taking in the last piece of info, it’s like sand settling on a jar.  It just all clicks into place, and I start brain dumping the good and the bad.  Once that brain dump is done, I see those reams of info, and parse it down to a few page summary.  

Then, I see that is too much for a busy person, and I condense that into a one page, low word-count summary.  I see things others do not because I look at all details of all pieces instead of just a subsection.

But this is mentally exhausting, and if I get distracted or pulled aside for anything else visual or thinky, it’s like formatting my hard drive.  Often, people undervalue the effort required, or the types of efficiency imprivements that can come from this.  Done right, it can save millions per year for an up-front cost of about 1 year’s savings, but so often, it’s done wrong, and just costs more money.  People get insecure, or defensive that a small team can do all of these functions across all of these technologies.  People often simply do not have the time to cooperate, nor the trust to provide access, nor the budget to have all of the info recreated that their teams withhold.

I hate the assessment part, and the difficulty getting into then staying in the right mindset to do it.  I hate the second guessing and the politics that impede all of it.  But I love the iterative discovery and consolidation of details."

You'd need to monitor the person to make sure they were not infecting others during the 4-6 weeks they still test positive, and you'd need to be able to handle if they became sick again due to maybe not all of the strains providing cross-immunity.

The concept of exponential growth is very difficult for much of the population to comprehend, and leadership is made of people, not magically superior people.  So, before acting, they waited until they could see that it was actually a risk by current numbers instead of future numbers.

Now, we are far behind the curve, and a lot of people STILL do not understand how detecting and containing those infected would actually help anything.  There are plenty of people who like the odds, think they cannot get sick, and don't want anyone telling them what to do.

We're on a path to martial law by May, but the next 3 days will give us an idea of how well people are self-isolating.  The reporting lag time is 12 days, and today is 12 days after pandemic was declared, and 2 days later is when the US declared a national emergency.  However, just the last 4 days did we have things like mandatory closings of dining rooms, theatres, etc.  Not everywhere is doing that.  In Texas, they are not mandating shelter in place state-wide, because 200 of our 256 counties have no confirmed cases.  This ignores the fact that when people come in with probable COVID19, instead of being tested, they are sent home and told to self-isolate.

All of this creates a feedback loop for a large percentage of the population to think the problem is not urgent yet.  I'm sure the economic impacts will also be used as a reason for why testing was not produced earlier.

The president did promise that Roche would be producing a lot of rapid testing capability, and that would be administered by 2 of the largest laboratory companies in the US, LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics.  Roche has a new, non-certified testing system, and was able to ship 400k tests 7 days after the declaration.  Their goal is 400k test kits per week.  The test is high complexity, so there is special equipment involved, and special staff training to run the kits.  However, at this point, we should have about a million test kits available across the US, and we have administered about 227k.

Note that typically, a person is tested three times over the course of their quarantine.  Total tests administered is much higher than the number of confirmed positives.  As such, you should see that we simply are not testing enough people.  Getting the test kits everywhere they are needed has been slow, and there have been several instances where other tests are given first, and if you test positive for influenza or step, then they do not test for SARS-2.

Besides logistics, it definitely seems like there is an aversion to unnecessarily testing people, which implies to me there is a fairly high cost for the test that is not fully accounted for."
Coronavirus,flaewvy,t1_fla7qr2,1584982505.0,"There is evidence that confirmed cases only account for 14% or so of the actual cases, and the others were predominantly mild.  If that were true, then the actual mortality rate works out to around 0.5% excluding the elderly, and 1.0% including the elderly.  Italy would stay double the rest of the world for a while because their average age is 9 years above the rest of the world.

However, that does not change that about 4.5% of confirmed cases end in death.  That only changes if we massively step up testing, which would dilute the death rate.

Also, this hypothesis means that the 60% inflection point might happen around 647 million confirmed cases, rather than 4.62 billion.

None of that changes the fact that we're overrunning the capacity to keep severe cases alive during the worst part of their illness, and once that happens, the mortality rate skyrockets."
Coronavirus,flae4c1,t1_fla0bhb,1584982059.0,"That makes sense.  I spoke to a respiratory therapist about it after posting, and basically, the time to go from a full face mask at 100% O2, on to mechanical ventillation, is too short to make a CPAP machine practical.  And the CPAP machine itself cannot run 100% O2, nor can it be ramped up for higher pressure.  Higher pressure requires safety systems and monitoring to make sure you don't damage the already weakened lungs.

I just feel like there should be something we can do, but maybe that something is we get people with skills and experience required to produce more ventilation machines, but not actively employed in that line of business, and make it practical for them to shift their effort into helping build more machines, and build more production capacity."

The reason we are facing this problem is because the people in authority positions are very slow to react.  

China had reports by mid December, and the world knew a new SARS was going on by mid January.  We could have been producing equipment and supplies starting then, and stockpiling in preparation.  The companies would not have wanted to spend that money without a guarantee, and that could have been handled by various governments committing to buy equipment and supplies.

Now, we're dealing with people not understanding that a company like 3M cannot just ""stop all other production and make only PPE"", because a factory that makes thermostats is not equipped to make sterile face masks.

Also sales channels could have had safety limits on sales of critical supplies in advance, so we would not still be dealing with inability to find masks, face shields, gloves, antiseptics, and toilet paper, when what's really happened is that people have filled their garages with supplies, and now are afraid to do anything since eBay and Amazon shut down scalper resales of these goods.

Could have, should have.  Ultimately, as a nation and a world, we are woefully unimaginative and unprepared.  Medicare for all would not fix that, it would just reduce the financial burden on the poor and middle class.

Now, outreach clinics for the indigent could help. There will be people dying under bridges if it gets much worse, and we're already in the zone where maybe it's too late to prevent that.  Texas is 10-20 days out from medical system collapse.  The US as a whole is probably 20-30 days out.  

Locally, people are still flagrantly ignoring requests to not congregate in large groups, and I've seen photos purporting to be from WA and IL and FL doing the same.

Coronavirus,fla444k,t1_fl9xrd2,1584976205.0,"Unlikely.  Once it infects a cell, it will eject its babies which spread interstitially, and are picked up by the lymph system, and spread to lymph nodes.  Also, the virus can infect any type of epithelium, including blood vessels.  In other words, no matter where you start it growing, it eventually spreads throughout the body.  This is why SARS-COV-2 is not just pneumogenic, but can also cause sepsis.

The only practical way of inoculating against it would be to have damaged versions, such as if you had a vat of it, lysed them all, destroyed the rna, and separated out the protein coat fragments, then injected those.  They would still bind, and cause a local reaction, which would be detected, and trigger an immune response; however, they would not be able to replicate, since there would be no mRNA.  It might take several inoculations to confer immunity.

I think the current proto-vaccine includes viral fragments that encode only for the spike, that have been synthesized.  They are first testing to make sure people don't have some horrible side effect from the new vaccine, and then they will test to see if people actually get immunity from it.  Once that's done, they'll work on mass producing it.

Another thing being thrown around is blood serum.  People with immunity will contain reminder tags in the blood, which remind the immune system how to react to this virus if it happens again.  Those reminders can be used to pre-warn other peoples' immune systems in some cases.  That's still yet to be tested here.

There may be other types of inoculations that confer immunity, but full power, live virus, anywhere in the body, would not be the way to go.

Below, I've linked to a photo showing one cell, and the small circles around the outside of this area, and around the vacuoles seen budding off of that cell, are corona virus particles.

Coronavirus,fla1pfw,t1_fl9xchv,1584974674.0,"Understand that gloves are not magic.  If you contaminate them, and then touch the contaminated part of the glove, then you are contaminated.  You can disinfect the outside of the gloves, there are ways to take gloves off without touching the outside of them with your skin.  Once you take them off, if you didn't disinfect them beforehand, you really should dispose of them.  If you put them back on, you've just wiped any germs all over the inside and outside of them.

Also, the gloves are not just to keep your hands from getting dirty.  Try not to touch other people and their stuff any more than you have to to do your job.  You could spread the germs from one customer to the next by contact with your gloves.

Face masks can help with moist particles in the air, but are not magic.  You'll suck air around the sides where the face seal is.  It helps a lot in some cases, especially if near a lot of people, but an N95 mask can get sweaty if you're wearing it non-stop all day.  In a non-medical environment, you could re-use masks, as long as you disinfect.  The easiest way there would be to have multiple masks.  When you're done with one for the shift, put it in sunlight, or let it sit for 3-5 days.  

Eventually, they get gross, but this could extend the life of that dust mask you're trying to use.  Or, you could make masks out of 2-3 layers of coffee filters.  Not ideal, but it will still stop wet particles if you make it cover like a surgical mask and stick on the sides so it's pleated.

3M makes some cheap, impact resistant, clear glasses that fit close to your eyes.  They can help protect against particles from sneezes and such that come over on a gust of air.  Maybe they look dorky, but a $3 pair of Virtua glasses will last  you months if you treat them right.  Not as good as goggles, or a spash shield, but you're also not at the same risk as a hospital worker.

Regular hand washing can be as good as gloved hands, but it relies on you never touching your face.  There's always an itch.  Gloves help  you remember not to.  Or maybe you use the back of your hand, and still wash often.  Maybe have a little case you can carry a fingernail brush in.

If you get any cuts, cover them up with a bandage after scrubbing.

Hand sanitizer works by alcohol ablation of the particles.  It has to sit liquid on your hands to really be effective.  It helps some in the first minute or two, but it doesn't wash off particles.  Your hands are still dirty, just with dead bacteria fragments on them now.  Still wash your hands when you can.

Keep your spacing.  Your coworkers are not safe.  You are not safe.  Your customers are not safe.  Don't be a vector, and don't let anyone else be a vector.

When you get home, put your clothes in the washer and take a shower.  This seems excessive, but you could be carrying this crud home.  Even though it's less hazardous for people under 64, it's not a walk in the park.  Plenty of people in their 30s have needed hospitalization.

Watch that Mythbuster's episode about germs and handwashing where they put a flourescent dust on something, brought it to a poker game, then came in with a blacklight 30 minutes later showing how and where it spread.  This will help your personal awareness.

Lastly, don't panic.  Yes, a lot of things to consider, and that just means go slower so you have time to process it all.  Your higher exposure risk can be mitigated, and one error is not likely to do you in.  It's the cumulative list of errors that is the problem, so that's what you're looking to reduce."

They already offer oxygen enrichment adapters for connecting an O2 line to the intake hose.  You couldn't do 100% and high volume with this, but it could free up capacity on the full-service equipment.

UPDATE: Found some practical reasons why this would not be a good effort.  The limited abilities of the machine mean it cannot serve as a vent, and it also cannot run at 100% O2, so it does not really fit between a face mask and actual ventilation."

When I am less motivated to do things that would be beneficial to my goals, or would simplify my life, I dissociate from the emotions enough that I usually do not punish myself over it.  Either I work on the motivation, or adjust my expectations to match my actual motivation instead of desired levels.

I do have worry, and cycle through a variety of statements about myself and feel different things about it (eg sorting out good and bad feelings, assessing current condition, digging in painfully sometimes).

Most of the time, I’m neutral.  When I notice I’m spending too much time with unconstructive feelings, I try to figure out what can change to improve the balance.

If you ask me “how are you doing?”, I probably do not know at any given time, but I’m fed, not usually in pain, and have rewarding people and activities in my life.  That’s probably “good”, and includes some “happiness”.

So, I try hard to pick what struggles I’m willing to confront, and which ones I can safely ignore.  It’s a daily choice, and never perfect, but right now, feel I’m in a good place.  I feel generally happy that I’m not making things worse."
