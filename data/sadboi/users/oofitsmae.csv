AskReddit,evqpaj0,t3_ckmwrg,1564695494.0,"A few years back I was pretty sick but my family took me to a Wal-Mart, and I felt like I was gonna throw up halfway through. 

So, as I do, I tell them I'm going to the restroom and begin walking that way. My father and I both have this thing where we will get what we call ""tunnel vision"": we literally feel so nauseous we can't see anything. 

So of course this happens as I'm walking. I run straight into a display thing with chips and stuff. A employee walks up to me and says, ""Are you alright?"" 

Suddenly I can see again and my grandma is in the distance, looking very annoyed, not worried at all. ""I'm gonna throw up,"" I warned this poor employee. She rushed and got this moldy bucket thing and guess what? I threw up in it. Didn't go back there for months, but avoiding one of the only grocery stores in your town is pretty difficult. 

Looking back on it, it was pretty funny. But being an edgy kid I was salty about it."
