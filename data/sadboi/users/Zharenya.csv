migraine,fk0wm40,t3_ffszoz,1583767760.0,"Oh goodness, as a kid my mom would always tell me to just to make myself throw up so I’d feel better faster. The horrible thing is, she was almost always right, for whatever reason once I’d finally get past the vomit, the migraine would usually start to ease up. Personally I give this up to the burst of endorphins released with vomiting. Now when the migraine hits, I get that little whisper that just wishes I’d hurry up with the vomit. I know there’s no point in taking my abortive medications until I’ve gotten that part done with, I’ll just be parting with them soon after if I take them too early. So it’s both the worst and best part of my migraines. I’m certain my head will burst during the process, but the relief after and knowing I can take medications is always worth the agony."
CPTSD,fft6ey2,t3_ev0jkl,1580209510.0,"I had very active imagination, especially from 3-12. I had at least 20 ‘brothers and sisters’ of various ages, occupations, marital status. When I got tired of one I’d kill them off. I remember very distinctly a ‘brother’ that died in a motorcycle accident, this was when I was in daycare. All the staff were offering condolences to my mother that day because I had described in great detail the accident and death. I had a ‘sister’ who was pregnant and expecting any day. I’d even apply these imaginary people to real people I’d see, and insist we stop at random houses so I could visit when we were driving somewhere (my grandmother thought this was great fun and would often stop and let me go to these strangers’ doors).

Around 12 the focus shifted into writing. I had a very elaborate world with a character named Prince Anthony. I’d spend all day daydreaming his world, and all night putting it on to paper. I filled dozens of notebooks with his world."

CPTSD,ff8uqnk,t3_es760n,1579696762.0,"I’ve accumulated a lot of medical information as well. Often I was left to doctor myself, I can do my own stitches, have reset some dislocated joints, and can nail down a concussion diagnosis like a pro. I also was left to my own devices a lot, so picked up juggling as a hobby (I’ve come to realize this isn’t something that’s very common). I can also write backwards flawlessly (another weird hobby), which was useful when trying to write notes to people and confuse the authoritative figures around me. I’m also incredibly good at mental math, because I was never allowed much by way of technology, and calculators were for ‘lazy people’, I do know how to use a slide ruler and abacus though (I didn’t even watch tv the first time until I was 16, this includes during school since it was always required to have permission slips to watch anything and it was always refused).

By the way, pay attention to the bruising and swelling of that toe/foot, it’s possible to break a bone higher up in the foot when stubbing that glorious pinky toe. I did that a few years back and ended up with bigger problems through stubbornness and refusing to admit it was more than just a broken toe for several weeks."
CPTSD,feg9zyt,t3_eoxj3n,1579084237.0,"I loved writing. It was my best form of communication. I’d pour my tortured soul out into journals and poetry. It all came crashing down the year I won a scholarship in middle school for a rather dark piece I had written. My mom never knew I was entering the contest, the teacher who submitted it for me was so artificial to my face though. She told me it was powerful and spoke on a level she wouldn’t have expected. Then she called home with concerns about my mental health. 

By the time I got home that afternoon, all my journals, all papers, all pens/pencils, were gone. My mom had been through and cleared out everything. I took a horrific beating that day for causing trouble, and for telling ‘lies’ in my journals. She spouted off things I’d never have dared to say to anyone, which was why I journaled, that she read (every word of course a bitter truth she refused to acknowledge). 

Even now, almost 20 years later she’ll pull out hidden gems from those journals (recent NC status has been liberating)0. 2 months after that teacher called my mom, she informed me I had won 1st place. I had refused to even look at that teacher since that day. I never wrote another word that wasn’t directly school related, and absolutely nothing that had any self expression. I wouldn’t even put my name on anything, wanting no one to come back with anything and say ‘yep that’s hers’.

Reddit has been a surprisingly comforting discovery for me. It’s not absolutely guaranteed anonymity, but it’s been the slow start of putting words down again.

Recently I’ve started to journal into an app on my phone. It’s not ideal, I sort of miss the feel of a pen scratching out those deep thoughts and parts of my soul I’d never openly shared with anyone before that day. I just can’t connect to that poetic part of myself that was crushed. It was my way of putting the horrors into a digestible format."
CPTSD,feg7xyy,t3_eosjva,1579081305.0,"Well, it sure has me pegged. I had the trauma, and then was encouraged to have food issues as well. My mother lived by the motto ‘no such thing as too rich or too thin’. In her book I was always fat, even though I was quite malnourished.

Growing up with Celiac in a family that had no concept of it, and absolutely refused to acknowledge it, made what few meals were provided very challenging. My mom only cooked maybe twice a week, and those meals almost always had food items that would make me violently ill. When meals weren’t provided, there were locks on the cupboards and refrigerator. 

Meal times were always a battle. I figured out pretty early on the things that made me sick, even if I had no understanding of why. Hours of sitting at the table, ending in being physically forced to eat the food. The rare occasions that there was something safe to eat, I’d gorge as much down as fast as possible and hope I could smuggle some away for later.

Added to the prolific abuse occurring, there was no way to come out of that without food issues.

Once moving out, all of a sudden I had this huge range of food I could eat, because I was buying and cooking it. I took on a ‘let’s make up for lost time’ approach. Morphing into full on binges, followed by long stretches of starvation again because I was appalled by my lack of control when there was no reason any more. 

Binge/starve cycles became the norm. Just by nature of the beast I gained a lot of weight, despite not eating most of the week. The days I did eat, just unbelievable how much I would eat.

Then there was a shift, for whatever reason. The binging slowly faded out, but the starving never went away. I’ve recently managed to make a connection, that I enjoy the feeling of hunger. It’s a very tangible feeling, there’s a cause, a reason, it’s logical. I’ve spent so much of my life disconnected from my body and emotions, that when something does get through the near constant dissociative states, it can be profoundly confusing. 

‘Oh, here we have panic, there’s nothing going on, why would this be happening?’ There’s no logic to it. It’s panic for the sake of panic.

‘I’m crying a lot today so this must be sadness, there’s no reason to be sad right now, absolutely nothing has happened.’ Again I’m hit with no logic.

But hunger! That always makes sense. ‘Well my stomach is ready to consume my spine, it’s probably because I haven’t had anything but water in the past 8 days.’ Yep, 100% rational response.

So I hang on to it, and relish it, savor the legitimacy of it, because I crave order and sense in my life. It shouldn’t be this way. I’m an adult, I live independently on my own. Whatever I say, it’s the way it is."
CPTSD,fe7s4fe,t3_eny8ip,1578918602.0,"Yes, though for me it carried well beyond just being organized into full blown OCD. It started out harmless enough, sorting things, I remember having a big box of beads and I loved to mix them up and sort them out again, I could occupy hours that way. 

Then all the beads had to be sitting a certain way, then they had to be in a certain number. Then other things had to be in certain numbers. Then before I knew it, I’d lost control of organizing.

I’m still very organized, OCD in much better control thanks to therapy, but order definitely brings a calm to me. I like things in their places, no matter where I am. I’m guilty of organizing shelves when grocery shopping.

I think I make my therapist a little crazy at times, I know immediately upon entering her office if something is out of place, and can’t really focus until it’s been fixed."

CPTSD,fcpb3ro,t1_fcop693,1577856785.0,Your GP could refer based on symptoms. They could also run blood work for cortisol levels (might as well just have a full endocrine work up though). Cortisol should be tested early morning if you’re looking for a potential adrenal insufficiency (more than one test is required to confirm an insufficiency). More tests come after that depending on results. Adrenal fatigue and insufficiency is greatly overlooked. It can appear as many other things and is usually the last thing GPs are considering when trying to explain ailments.
CPTSD,fco2qbs,t3_ehxp5q,1577822968.0,"This is familiar to me. It’s like I have an on/off switch. There is the work me, which has to be turned to the on setting, where my inner chaos has to take a back seat. Then there’s the rest of the time where I’m able to be genuine and not put up a front. Sometimes the off setting starts to leak into work hours, but overall there has to be a hard line between the two. I also couldn’t come home and tell you about my day for the most part (minus any big events), I’m very disconnected from it, because even though I have to keep my chaos in check, it’s still running in the background, just can’t be given full focus, but oh goodness does it take a lot of effort to keep that all in check. Fortunately I work a job and shift that allows me to conserve some energy so even with a 10 or so hour shift I only have to put on the face for about 3 of that when there are actually people awake and requiring interaction."

Then I have a panic attack, the atmosphere changes and she whips out the most distressing response in her arsenal, ‘are you in crisis?’, well thanks, now I’m not only having a standard panic attack, I’m panicking that you’re panicking because I’m clearly being beyond dramatic and you have no desire to deal with this. Which causes a whole mess of me trying to fix the situation which leads me back to thinking she thinks I’m overdramatic, because who has a panic attack and 30 seconds later spins into trying to convince you it’s not as bad as it is? She’s really coming from a good place when she asks that, I have a long history of being in crisis, so she’s really just making sure I’m not in a major spiral (of course also covering herself)."

Self compassion anything feels very foreign. Though I think google and I will have to spend some time together and see what we come up with.

CPTSD,fc6b7da,t1_fc5nakd,1577476512.0,"I think the biggest problem I have is that the wounded part is still wounded? If that makes any sense. Yes my child self survived and that did take strength, but I’m overwhelmed with the hatred of still having that part. I’ve done a lot of work on ‘I’m an adult now and my situation is completely different’ and I thought by subscribing to that mentality this hurt part of me would just sort of fade off into the abyss, and yet, here it is still scrabbling for purchase and focus and attention. 

Though there very well could be a lot of transferring my own self worth to the wounded part. For as much progress as I’ve made, I do still hold myself in very low regard. This is definitely a concept I’ll be bringing back to my next therapy appointment."
CPTSD,fc5bjon,t3_eg8nyu,1577452253.0,"So I got taken to the ‘doctor’ who was a family friend as a kid. It was patch and go kind of service, there was no real care. Always paid under the table. Going to the doctor as an adult was so shocking. I found out I have serious medical concerns and it’s been overwhelming. I pretty much avoid it unless I’m sure I’m going to die in the next few days or have fully run out of medication and need a refill they won’t do over the phone, and then it’s a game of catch up.

Dentist is by far the hardest. I always require sedation, or I shake so hard nothing gets done. This poses the biggest problem because I have no real support system. There’s no one to take me to and from the appointments, my last cleaning the dentist himself drove me to and from (he’s super nice and has gone above and beyond for me). As a kid I think I went twice total to the dentist, pretty sure I bit the dentist both times and my mom decided to just forget the whole concept."

CPTSD,fbxqm8o,t3_ef10oq,1577197761.0,"Reading. Lots and lots of books, fantasy has become my recent focus. Oddly enough given my history I was obsessed with the horror and extreme horror genre for a long time (I guess I liked knowing really awful things weren’t exclusive to me? Even if it was just fiction). It’s 110% escaping my reality and avoiding life but it’s always a nice break when things are getting to be too much.

Cooking also. I live alone so I don’t get to cook as often as I’d like since I always have 4+ portions of every meal I make and that could take me 4+ days to eat. I’ve been branching out to home cooked dog food and cat food though so that’s been kind of nice. I like cooking though because it gives me a lot of control. How much, what, when.

I used to draw a lot. My drawings started getting super dark and shocking though so I just, stopped. Used to write a lot too, but same thing, it started getting really really dark and I figured if any thing should ever happen to me, I don’t want someone reading that stuff."

I’ve never interviewed well because I always go with the expectation of rejection which probably knocked me out of the running for all the other jobs interviewed at.

This probably isn’t a super helpful comment. My main point in commenting is that it’s a numbers game. As discouraging as it can be, you just have to flood the market with your applications.

It way over extends me, there have been weeks I’ve worked 90 hours, because I just can’t say no as soon as someone plays the family card. Plus I’m always desperate for overtime because $$. I’m in a fairly low paying job and thanks to medical problems, psychiatric needs, therapy costs, medications, having 2 pets, an apartment that’s frankly too expensive for what it actually is, and that pesky need to be able to buy food, I’m always stretched to the last dime and dangerously close to being your neighboring bag lady.

It gets to where I make mistakes at work, and while some are harmless, part of my job is administering medication. That can turn terrible real fast. Last week I damaged the work van, $1200 for repairs (thank goodness for the agency car insurance), from being tired from picking up 2 extra shifts and agreeing to stay late to help my boss work on end of the year paperwork each day. 

The thing is, my boss knows I just won’t say no to the extra, so she abuses that like crazy. I of course am compelled to accept and then when I mess up or just can’t keep up, feel terrible.

The Sound of Silence - Disturbed (love this song by most artists but Disturbed is by far my favorite for it)

Wrong Side of Heaven - Five Finger Death Punch (being non-religious, and having grown up in a religious family, this song just pegs it for me ‘I’m no hero, and I’m not made of stone, I’m on the wrong side of heaven, and the righteous side of hell’ hits just the right spot for me)

The Light - Disturbed (‘you need never feel broken again, sometimes darkness can show you the light’ much more to the song, but this particular line is part of the chorus, and just fills me with hope, they are singing about being forsaken by love, and I’m sure it’s mean in a romantic way, but I prefer to interpret it as love that feels safe)

I know intrusive thoughts can feel so powerful, and consuming; I also know that the anxiety that comes with them loves to be big, bad, and in charge. Anxiety unchallenged runs rampant and causes chaos, and OCD (from my own experience) is fundamentally anxiety driven. 

My thinking is, this apartment is YOUR apartment. This is YOUR space. Yes, you had unfortunate company show up unexpectedly, yes you have very negative experiences and thoughts associated with said company. But, they have left, it’s still YOUR space, you can choose to never allow them back. You get to decide the who, what, when, and why of things taking place there. 

Can you live with it is the bigger question? Can you see yourself taming this enough to still be living there a week from now? A month? 6 months?

Yes, he does help with both bedtime and morning routine. Admittedly slightly skewed since my days/nights are flipped due to work schedule.

Regardless, he definitely lets me know when it’s time to get up. I do set an alarm too and if I’m trying to sleep through it, well that just won’t be working. He also has his ‘last call’ for the night, which is pretty much like clockwork. So getting up and going to bed are pretty well mapped out, after he goes out for the last time he heads straight for bed, though will come looking for me if I’m dawdling.

As for walks, I have a sheltie which is a higher energy dog. There are breeds who would be happy not to go out for a walk every single day (pugs, bulldogs, etc). It really is good motivation though to get out. I don’t walk mine on days it’s raining heavily, on super hot days (above 75 since we walk on asphalt) or on very cold days (below 20).

Anyways, I pretty much had to try just about everything. So many foods I’d never eaten (turns out I’m a really good cook!), clothes I’d have never considered wearing (spent many many hours just trying on practically everything in every store), I’d go to car dealerships and sit in every car they’d let me, shoe stores trying on every single pair of shoes in my size, used apps to try hair styles and colors, apps to try different paint colors for my apartment, you name it, I was testing it out. It was a process.

So now I know I love chicken, and cauliflower, and mashed potatoes, and absolutely hate asparagus. Definitely like teal and brown, don’t look good in red at all. Love Hyundai cars, New Balance shoes, and so on. 

Probably never going to have a favorite movie or show, but I just don’t have the attention span to sit through tv related things (don’t even own one). Though books are awesome.

I spend almost all of my time at home in my bed and never correlated it to being a safe place. So very true though. Especially after having moved home when I’d been out on my own for 5 years. I was cooped up in my room to avoid the chaos. Now back in my own apartment I still just lurk in my bedroom."
CPTSD,fb9w24n,t3_ec8d1n,1576652164.0,"Could you do medical coding or transcription? I think it’s only a couple weeks of training, and I believe there’s a lot of opportunities to do it from home even.

Depending on your writing skills you could maybe look into ghost writing. I did that for a while at one point, the company I was with went under but I wouldn’t be surprised if there are others out there.

Depending on your location, and preference of schedule, you could maybe find night work? Office cleaning is nice, usually you’re by yourself so it’s less interaction with people. 

You mentioned veterinarian, I know it would be putting you front and center, but maybe see about a reception job at a vets office? Cute animals coming in and out all the time! They also usually pay pretty decent."
OCD,fb9uj7f,t3_ec451p,1576650409.0,"It’s so difficult when you have your own space and it gets intruded upon. I had to set boundaries of steel with my mother. She’s not allowed at my apartment, and the one time she did show up I ended up needing police involvement. She also had a habit of calling and texting all the time, so I had to put in place a 3 texts a day rule, and she may only call me once a week. I felt horrible putting those in place but for my own sanity I had to. If she breaks my call/text rules I block her number for a week at a time. 

Would it help to do some sort of a cleansing for your bathroom? Maybe really take some time to scrub it top to bottom, burn a nice candle or some sage in it, and wash away your father’s presence from it? Heck, if you can afford it maybe do a mini makeover for the bathroom, new shower curtain, rug, towels etc, totally change the feel of the bathroom?"
CPTSD,fb9qify,t3_ec7bh6,1576646260.0,"Not with siblings in my case. I grew up on a farm, we had a large family around though, multiple generations, multiple family units. My mother and step father and then later on numerous boyfriends, her brothers with their families, my grandparents. Not to mention farm hands and neighboring farmers around to help out.

And no one ever said or did anything. I wasn’t the only child being abused, but adults not involved in the abuse just turned a blind eye even when things were happening in plain sight. I even attempted to speak up at school, but was pretty much told to shut up, small town mentality, protect your own and don’t make waves.

Even today with pretty much everyone gone from the farm, they all pretend nothing happened. My mother is of the opinion she’s this amazing person, my other abusers would tell you nothing of the sort ever occurred. The one sane person in the whole fiasco was powerless to do anything then, and she’s since passed so there’s no way to get the validation from her that it did indeed all happen like I remember.

Gosh even the other survivors, can’t talk to them either. Everyone blames everyone else because that’s how it was set up, one of us would get targeted on a particular day and it would be made to be another’s fault. So much anger and hatred still, it’s just amazing.

I rambled, sorry, but I do know the feeling, even if it’s not quite the same circumstance. That abandonment and loneliness of knowing there should have been people on your side and then seeing them just out of reach doing nothing."
CPTSD,fb9i2zr,t3_ec5ca5,1576639149.0,"Absolutely. I’m a 3rd shift worker, so I’m already at a disadvantage where I’m on an opposite schedule to most people. So my awake hours are when most of the world is sleeping, while I don’t enjoy socializing, if I wanted to there’s very limited options. I do take care of my pets well throughout.

So I sleep, go to work, come home, sleep, and repeat. My days off are dedicated to grocery shopping, cooking my meals for the week, making sure my apartment is clean, going to therapy, and recouping from my work week. I don’t have television, or video games as an outlet, so I read a lot. Take walks when the weather permits, and get on my stationary bike. 

Otherwise it’s just the slog to make sure I can show up for work again. Even that would get less dedication if I didn’t have such good insurance through my employer."

He gives me a reason to get up, go outside, exercise, sporadically socialize, focus on something outside of myself, gives me devoted love and affection, and a sense of protection. 

I have a great employer who allows me to bring him to work most of the time, occasionally he’s unable to come with me and those nights are difficult to be sure. 

They’re not for everyone, and I suppose people could get just as much value from social circles and good hobbies, but it ended up being a great fit for me. I frankly have no friends, and I’ve never found a hobby besides reading that’s held my interest, and books only do so much."

Sorry your teeth are an insecurity, if it’s anything like my own insecurities I’m sure you think it’s way worse than anyone else does. I know I’m way more particular about myself than anyone else is about me.

Used to have a lot of dreams about teeth before I was put in a med to stop dreaming. Only have maybe 1-2 dreams a month now and they tend to be just truly bizarre more than anything else.

-very low threshold for being touched, at all (including handshakes upon meeting someone new)

-I always enter a room quietly, never say ‘hello’ or draw attention to myself if other people are there (this drives my boss at work absolutely insane)

-obsessive skin picking on my hands, scab picking, and tooth brushing

CPTSD,f8xv6to,t3_e2uyex,1574935830.0,"Yes, goodness I could have written exactly what you did. I’ve been with my therapist a very long time, and at first if I said 100 words in our sessions it would have counted as an extremely good one. I took a long time to really build trust, and we had to legitimately work on some communication skills. At that time I could have gone a whole month and maybe said 10 words total to anyone. I was jaded from therapy experiences as a teen, convinced I was invisible and worthless, and generally just a hot mess. I speak a whole lot more now, in sessions and outside of them.

The biggest hurdle is finding someone you feel you can work well with. Initially I found it extremely helpful that I had my therapist’s email, she had me pretty much keep a journal document that I’d email the day before our sessions so we’d have some ammunition for our sessions. That way we could ‘talk’ about things better with less words. Used that for a long time, and still do from time to time. Like you, I do much much better over text/writing."

Children are cruel and reactive, and very good at reenacting what is emulated to them.

You seem truly remorseful, as far as text can convey. I know everyone praises the glory of therapy and medication, but as someone doing both myself for my own demons and mental health, I do truly believe in the value of them. You aren’t here asking for advice, but if it’s available to you and you’re willing I would venture to make the recommendation to at least try therapy.

CPTSD,f8usmdp,t3_e1yi66,1574842174.0,"Absolutely, work is a big one. Personally my boss is like a mirror image of my mother who has never been much of a positive figure in my life (to put it mildly). I literally have no idea what is going to walk through the doors when she comes in, if she even bothers to show up. One day she’s syrupy sweet to me, the next she’s on a rampage about something someone did who isn’t me but I’m the winner of the meltdown because I’m the first one she sees. I ask myself every day leaving work if it’s worth it to have my job, and ask myself every day before going in if I have the strength to do it today.

Really though anything I HAVE to do with any commitment brings on the dread, because what if I just CAN’T? Then who does it? Am I the bad guy for having an inability to fulfill that commitment in that moment? Then I’m on the spiral which starts to make simple obligations practically impossible until that dread pretty much forces me out the door because I’m sure the world is collapsing around me. Yep, definitely know that dread."

Bless her for being willing to help nudge things because I personally work well with someone who’s willing to do a ‘last session we discussed...’ and check in if that needs more discussion. If left to my own devices I sort of prattle on aimlessly for a while before I stumble on something that leads in to something of value. Usually while checking in on a topic previously discussed I end up leading into something else that needs to be worked on.

depression,f4x7kre,t3_dm2oe0,1571863121.0,"I went through a very rough period of time early teens to mid twenties. My parents biggest misstep was treating me like my mental status.

Which ultimately compounded the problems and led to much bigger issues than were already there. Mind you my home life was a train wreck to start with and the ‘support’ wasn’t nearly what it sounds like you’re providing.

So really my best advice is to keep in mind she’s still your daughter with passions and interests, even if they’re muted by the depression. She’s not just the depression. Don’t walk on eggshells around her, I promise you she’ll notice if you do. Be open and honest, ask her about her day, her friends, if there’s anything she needs. Let her play her music a little louder if she needs to (even if it’s the same song on repeat 100 times), get her a really nice journal if she’s into that.
