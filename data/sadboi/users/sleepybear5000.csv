PublicFreakout,fqd3d6u,t1_fqd37u4,1589278331.0,I said it was something along the lines of ‚Äúkiss me and see what happens‚Äù. Couldn‚Äôt remember the exact words when I made the comment
HumansBeingBros,fqd37id,t3_gi7oxo,1589278175.0,"I wish I did something similar with an online friend of mine way back in the mw2 days. We were both young kids, same exact age, lived in 2 different states, but would always get on Xbox right after school and played for hours everyday. We added each other on MySpace, got to know each other personally, introduced him to my school friends online, but I think one day we kinda just didn‚Äôt play ever again. Dude was definitely one of my closest friends at the time and I never met him in person, I still remember his gamertag from then. If you‚Äôre out there ACGmaster, you aight homie."
