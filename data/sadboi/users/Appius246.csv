bipolar,fowar0b,t3_g9u0fn,1588116180.0,"My life experience on gaining 2lbs a week (starting at 172lbs.) and plateuing at 290 ish?:

&#x200B;

So much waisted research, to much worrying, dont obsesivly weigh everyday, water weight is real, scale can fluctuate by 5 pounds or even up to 10 pounds a day from salt causing weight gain. I was to lethargic and exhausted to exersise until I plateued at 290 then started getting obssessed with push ups.

&#x200B;

Started 2 years ago doing 5 knee push ups a day, 2 years later I can do 100 or more pushups in a day (full body weight) being around 270 pounds. 

&#x200B;

The lowest I have ever been was 260 doing the carnivor diet for a month, 3 steaks a day, scrambled eggs and homo-milk. FYI: very expensive.

&#x200B;

I have found that I cant really lose weight exept that I can change my body composition to more muscle.

&#x200B;

Allways use the same scale to weigh yourself, never use different scales because it will say you weigh more then you actually do and you get super de-motivated or say you lost a lot of weight that you didnt and you get super exited then even more de-motivated later when you find out you didnt actually lose anything.

&#x200B;

If you are really interested in your ""body weight"" then get your medical practitioner to use a medical scale at every appointment.

&#x200B;

For exersise you have to do something you find fun or you wont keep doing it. For example in 2 years I Want to be able to say I can do 100 pushups in one set, right now I can do 20 at a time until it adds up to 100 a day.

&#x200B;

If you want to feel really awesome about being a ""hulk"" pushups are around 70% of your body weight lifted in each pushup so the bigger you are on the scale the more you effort you are actually putting into a push up... so basicly every pushup I do I am moving 220 pounds.

&#x200B;

I got into cardio. In the begining I tryed couch to 25k ... nope to insane, to heavy, knees cant take it. Couch to 5k nope still to much... so I decided to walk to the end of the road where I live and its 3.6k. So I find now I am disappointed in myself if I am walking and I dont make it to the end of the road and back.  Also if you have a dogo that loves walking it makes walking actually fun to see what exites the dog on the walk.

My most recent therapist said something along the lines or I understood it anyways, as : I have to learn the normal range of emotions again. O I remember now, she said ""You have to stop pathologizing yourself""

So I guess I havnt learned when to worry and when not to worry about my behaviour yet?

Like my old Social Worker said ""It isnt allways ur fault when somethign goes wrong.""

&#x200B;

So now I am just kind of in limbo again wondering when I get mad is it justified or is it bipolar? He also used to refer to it as ""sticky anger"" which I am guessing he just refeared to anger issues because I wasnt diagnosed bipolar when I worked with him.
