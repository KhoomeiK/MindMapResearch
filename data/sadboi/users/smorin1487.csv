Do I sometimes get depressed and lose perspective? Absolutely! But I try to never think I’m “unlucky”.

wow,formby2,t1_foqb9j5,1588014653.0,"Thanks! That helps. 

All those choices seem to make sense. 

We should also be able to take stand at normal and heroic Eternal Palace for 415/430 gear if we want, correct? Would we be feared enough at 380/400?"
wow,forlzty,t1_forl3lx,1588014486.0,"Amen, I’m not looking to do anything like that. I’m trying to plot what I should be doing that follows the right gear path.

Currently 400: doing heroic dungeons on group finder. Drops 415.
Looks like heroic and mythic eternal palace is also fruitful as it drops 415, 430. Correct? Would my gear be acceptable in those two versions of Eternal Palace?
Nylotha LFR looks to drop 430 as well.

Fill that out and start mythic.. drops 430? 
Then when full 430... can run higher mythic dungeons and normal/heroic Nyloth raid.

Sound correct?"
wow,forkkwb,t1_foqo6u2,1588013795.0,"By current content... do you mean heroic dungeons and mythic that are in the group finder?

My most specific question is how to feel ready to do Mythic and “current raids” when heroic dungeons only drop 415 and if I understood correctly, you need 420 or so to start mythic, which drops 430.

We just like raiding... larger scale, more “epic”, so we do hope to get to a place where we can queue up for LFR or use premade finder for relevant pug raids until we have recruited enough in our guild for our own premades."

wow,forkbih,t1_foqmb8b,1588013669.0,My brain is working through this: I should work through LFR without touching raids? Do WoW players not consider LFR as raids?

wow,foqbazp,t3_g8ze28,1587989123.0,"I see, that’s fascinating to me, since in SWTOR there is only one raid per *expansion*. So for the 2 months or so between patches you only have that long to get through an entire raid? Man, they must crack the whip to create so many raids that will never get touched. Well thanks for the tip.

So, can we LFR for Eternal Palace, you think?"
