opiates,flseknm,t3_fq01x5,1585440368.0,"UK based journalist but you’re asking info about coronavirus’ effects on dealing and dope just... generally? That doesn’t make any sense. Any journalistic “insight” is arbitrary when the communities affected have so many different variables affecting their dope and the quality of it.  

In other words your “research” is wide to the point of suspicion lol."
TrueChristian,fkbpdm1,t1_fkbmz7s,1584037313.0,"I fell away from God for a good 5 months this year... I’ve never been a “good Christian” but I have been a believer for at least the past 5 years. My big problem is drugs... when I feel like I can’t cope and I need something to immediately make me feel better I turn to that. I’ve been turning to God and getting closer to God again over the past few weeks. I’ve been doing so much better spiritually and in my life but I still turn to drinking a few beers when I get really stressed out. I hate doing it, even when I’m in line to pay that still small voice says you’re making a mistake just put it back. But then I just do it anyway :( 

I feel like I’ll never be good enough for God. But I guess no one is good enough for God, but He loves us anyway. I need to rely on Him more instead of this worldly, faulty human stuff. There will never be true peace in the material world."
TrueChristian,fj8pycx,t1_fj56b5h,1583119257.0,"I’ve been very symptomatic lately. I’ve been having huge meltdowns and it’s causing a lot of problems in my relationship. My boyfriend still won’t talk to me... it’s more pain than I can bear, and in this time I’ve been trying to grow closer to God and turn my problems over to Him and trust that He is in total control and knows what I need. God has helped me more than any therapy or meds have (though I am on a bunch of meds now). I ask God every day to take away this intolerable pain and it’s gotten easier over the past day. I trust in Him so much more now."

BPD,fhocjtj,t3_f45wtu,1581750020.0,It’s the constant seeking of love and never recognizing the love you get and have. It never feels like enough does it?
Drugs,fho5i70,t3_f44kiu,1581742145.0,"It sounds like you really want to stop. No one can tell you if you need rehab or not though. How long have you been drinking and how much?

I was cross addicted to alcohol and benzos as well. I STRONGLY advise you to not quit on your own. You’d probably be best off st detox. The two addictions exacerbate each other. I’ve been there and been withdrawing from both cold turkey st the same time and almost had a massive seizure that could’ve killed me."
quittingkratom,fho5cu3,t3_eel8vh,1581742002.0,ME!!! I literally typed in “yellow poop” to find this. I’m on day 2 of CTing off 15-30 gpd.

quittingkratom,fhlx8sj,t1_fhlvci4,1581705844.0,"I have very little appetite but force myself to eat 3x daily but I can’t eat a lot because my stomach has shrunk. I’ve always been VERY thin naturally but it’s excessive now. 

I used be a very heavy drinker, I drank a fifth a day at only 100lbs and 5’5” for years. Never had a thing wrong with my liver so I hope I didn’t fuck that up with kratom. That’s so scary. I was in the hospital for a stomach virus in December and they did a bunch of blood tests and said everything was normal except I needed potassium. So I guess my liver is fine? I’m also a hypochondriac-_-  

Fuck this demonic drug. I feel like it should be illegal now. Switching from oxy to kratom was a horrible decision. I can’t believe how long I’ve been in denial. I hope all turns out well w your test results and liver. That’s some scary shit."
quittingkratom,fhln5oa,t1_fhldmsw,1581702514.0,"I know how it feels. I haven’t been able to regulate body temperate for a year now. It’s maybe the most frustrating and uncomfortable part of being addicted to kratom. I’m NEVER physically comfortable. 

I’ve withdrawn from alcohol addiction that was made worse buy a co-occurring benzo addiction. Benzos and alcohol are some of the hardest shit to withdraw from so I’m expecting I’ll handle this well. The worst will be the mental shit as is always the case with me. 

How has kratom affected your organs? I’m afraid I’ve damaged my insides. I barely ever have an appetite and food disgusts me. I’m severely underweight but I drink like at least 4 liters of water a day so I don’t think I’m dehydrated. 

The way this shit affects my relationship is the worst part of it all. Knowing it’s being gutted but feeling like you can’t stop it. It’s horrific. I cannot lose another person because of drugs. I just can’t take it anymore. Sorry you’re going through this horrible pain too."

quittingkratom,fhlmh39,t1_fhlf3kl,1581702228.0,"The painful thing is I know why I jump from drug to drug, but I feel powerless to stop doing it most of the time. It’s horrible to be so self aware yet out of control."
quittingkratom,fhlb76z,t1_fhla8b3,1581698236.0,"I’ve had suicidal thoughts since I was 12 (almost 27 now) but I’m medicated and I’m on the same meds I was when I wasn’t on kratom and back then they worked and now they don’t since I’m on kratom. I cannot keep inflicting this lunacy on others. I’m sick of wasting my money and my life revolving around one substance or another, illegal or legal."
quittingkratom,fhl9cv6,t1_fhl8s0h,1581697398.0,"I’m 99% sure that’s exactly the case. I’m on mood stabilizers and an antidepressant and I’m STILL throwing temper tantrums like a toddler, sobbing all the time, punching myself in the head, bruising myself all over my body. I’m like this off my meds while sober, which is why I’m medicated, but now I’m like this ON my meds. It’s FUCKED. thanks for the tip about vitamin C, I’ll take some."
Drugs,fhl94rs,t1_fhkzznc,1581697285.0,"This is exactly how I feel. I’m quitting kratom rn so I haven’t exactly been sober but I seriously cannot handle interacting with “regular” people. It all feels completely fake and pointless. I’ve also been through years of therapy and never felt I gained anymore insight than I already had or could’ve concluded on my own. 

But this is why I’m getting sober, for real, from everything except weed to be honest: I used to have interests before opiates, alcohol, benzos, kratom. I did things. I had thoughts. I no longer feel like a person. All I do is hide in my house all day and all night. I have no motivation no desire. Just apathy. All my interests are just GONE. I feel like I may as well be dead. So I’d say being sober is probably better though I don’t remember what it feels like."
quittingkratom,fhl8ea2,t1_fhl8053,1581696927.0,"How’s it been so far? How many gpd and how long were you on it? I don’t really feel any withdrawal, but I was hysterical all day yesterday. Maybe that was a wd symptom I just could not calm down no matter what. I feel consumed with guilt today for my meltdown yesterday. I’m also SO cold then SO fucking hot. I haven’t been able to regulate my body temperature since I started opiates. I’m always having a hot flash or I’m freezing."

BPD,fhje7f7,t1_fhj8r3i,1581643995.0,It doesn’t help I just calm down enough for them to let me leave bc. I get bored w it and calm down after a while but then I’m trapped there so fuck the hospital in just stoned watching tv now distracting myself I don’t need more bills lol

BPD,fhj0z2i,t1_fhizz32,1581635921.0,Lol I also kinda see my BPD as a separate entity in my head. Sometimes I yell at it and I pretend it’s a person so I can tell it to shut the fuck up. I’d never let someone speak to me the way my BPD speaks to me.
