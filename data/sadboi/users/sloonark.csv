Of course league and union are different sports. They have different rules and numbers of players. You think the fact that they both have 'rugby' in their name is the deciding factor? Soccer is called ""Association Football"" and Aussie Rules is called ""Australian Football"". Are they the same sport? What about tennis and table tennis?

The [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_rugby_league_and_rugby_union) refers to ""the two sports"".

You even admit in one of your comments that you ""don't know much about rugby."" I've been following league for thirty years. They are never treated as one sport.
