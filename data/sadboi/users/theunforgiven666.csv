Testosterone,fqzs4lt,t3_glramh,1589774081.0,"Clomid has no effect on raising or lowering you estrogen. 

It was designed to be used as a drug to increase fertility in men. In fact most men are prescribed clomid prior to getting on trt because in most case it solves low testosterone problems. The key is in finding your sweet spot. It has a half life of 5-7 days. So at 25mg a day you're at 175mg a week but by day 4 you have 100mg in your system. This is waaaaay too much. 

12.5 mg every 2 or 3 days will be just as effective. Remember that these are powerful drugs. Most dose used today were unheard of 50 years ago. Back then they used to do 250mg of test and train. Today 1gram of test is common. 
Don't follow bro science....follow proven practice. Many of the older timers are old now and most are not on trt because they used lown to moderate doses. Higher doses will do major damage to the hypothamumus and pituitary....resulting in a dead dick.

This is why most people get blood tests, everything comes out normal, but you still don't work....it's the hypothamumus or pituitary that has been shut down for too long. 

I would try clomid at 12.5mg EOD and even go as far as 6.25mg ED for the first week to see how you feel."

Too many double standards here and too much gaslighting.

Some people have mentioned erectile dysfunction while on Tbol? 
I find this weird as I had raging hard ons all the time for the full course. 

25mg is the sweet spot for me zero side effects. 

I did one cycle of 40mg for 4 weeks, 60mg for 4 weeks, and back to to 20mg for 4 weeks. My endurance and strength had no end....but my side effects were bad....anxiety, no libido, acid reflux(major), and muscle cramping.

Testosterone,fqvqftg,t3_gl1vzq,1589682867.0,"Your testosterone levels mean much less than you think. 

If your issues are erectile dysfunction and low libido. Then I would look into SHBG. 

Your body is not producing test because there is an imbalance somewhere else. Think of it this way. If your kidneys are not working properly, than neither is your liver. 

TRT is not a life long commitment but you have to be committed to doing it. You can be in TRT for 12 months and still get off and bounce back to normal test levels. Hormone doctors use clomid for this, because clomid wakes up the SHBG and makes it work again. 

Most doctors will put someone in your situation in clomid first, to see the results. In many cases if fixes the issue. Now this also depends on your age. If you're under 35, it may work. If you're over 50? Just get on trt, regardless of you need it or not, it'll change your life by bringing you back 30 years."

They're coming out with a TRT pill called androxal....which is a tweaked version of clomid.

Just that a man looking for a relationship would not find that attractive.
Your worth is more than the validation of men."
BPD,fq2ywzq,t1_fq2rf56,1589061468.0,"It's not fucked. Many women go after assholes or men that pay no attention to them. It's a primal trait. Women like to flaunt for attention because that's how we used to mate. Men used to display power, strength and capability to provide and protect....today power and strength are in dollars, which is why some women choose the rich dudes. 

Your feelings are perfectly normal and I think that it's very healthy to stay alone at this time, atleast for a while. Just up until you need much less validation from men. 

I personally find it very unattractive and would never approach a woman if she sought the validation of many men. Another tip coming from a an experienced man.... most guys that will respond to this type of attention will only be interested in fucking you, the rest will get hurt by you because of your actions.

One thing about relationships that is very unexplainable is the karmic effect. He will begin to unknowingly follow your energy and do what you're doing. In other words he will get bored, flirt and fuck other girls, etc. You think he won't, but he will....trust me on this.

You're body will bounce back naturally. The length of time this happens determines on the length of the cycle. 

The information most of you are providing is for pro bodybuilding. Pro bodybuilders laugh at 600mg of test a week. They use 1000mg or more a week of test alone. Very different ball game. 

The old timers are still around and well into their 70s.....follow what works. 

Taking test because you're taking tbol is just plain stupid.

If you're going on for 8 weeks you'll be fine. More than than that you'll need a different regimen when it's over if you choose to do it. I'd not your body will begin producing on it's own after 3 weeks post cycle. 

Men and women are put on hormone medication of all kinds.....they do not go on pct.

In fact if you mention pct to a hormone doctor they'll instantly ask you where you heard that from, because they also call it bro science.

It's a mild drug.

I guarantee you that if you try a simple cycle of 20mg anavar (pharma grade), along with creatine. You'll never touch anything else again unless you're a pro bodybuilder.

Elaborate on what kind of relationship your family has with his. Do you even see eachother? 
If you come out and say that he molested you when you were younger, it won't work unless you know other people that he molested. 
You can get a restraining order against you if he lives in the same city/state/province. 
Sending an anonymous letter is risky because what if you were the only one he did it to? Now you've put yourself in danger.

Basically.... you can't do this alone. You're either going to expose yourself and risk humiliation or say nothing. 

Now if you care enough, here's what I would do. Contact his wife and explain your story. She will be in denial 100% because of shock but it will plant a seed. 

Second - get that restraining order. When it gets sent to the house it'll plant a seed in his wife's head. 

Third- confide in a family member who will have your back. 

Lastly - these people usually prey on other people's kids and out of their household. This is obviously not a hard rule but it's more common.

What you think may be a healthy diet, may actually be killing you slowly. Diets are unique to each individual, we can't throw everyone in a box and tell them eat the same thing.

Most men lose erection quality in their late 30s to early 40s not because they're getting old but because of life's stressors. 

The basic american diet causes tremendous spikes in prolactin. 
At your age you can lower this with diet. Stop thinking that you have to perform like a pornstar. When I began having sex most girls loved it because I take about 45 mins to an hour to cum. Until I met a girl that wanted multiple sessions throughout the day that lasted 5 to 10 mins each. I could not do that, and guess what happened? I developed psychological ed. I then dived into research and began to understand that the reason I couldn't cum quickly or a few times in a couple of hours was because I had high prolactin. I began to lower my prolactin and I was able to cum in under 15 mins. Now I'm dating a woman that loves it when Last longer..... damned if you do, damned if you don't.

relationship_advice,fnby8f6,t1_fnbtsxx,1586824713.0,"Strip clubs, rape, prostitution, and exploitation of female sexuality dates back to ancient Egypt. 

And low sex drive is in no way a part of a healthy lifestyle. A low sex drive is physical, psychological or both. Unless you're putting an effort in suppressing for spiritual reasons.  Aside from that there is no human that is wired that way, you're delusional. Every man and woman in a monogamous relationship has to put an effort into being monogamous and has to put an effort to diminish sexual attraction for others. Hence it is unnatural. 
Some species on earth are monogamous and mate for life, their habits are very different from ours.

You're talking from an academic perspective of read and repeat. I'm talking about the progression of life. The world had many female leaders prior to patriarchy. The only literature that says otherwise is that which was written by patriarchy. 

Prior to patriarchy sexuality was fluent and free, women were worshiped. Patriarchy enslaved them to man. 

Monogamy is a creation of patriarchy, touch up on your history of ancient cultures. In ancient greece and ancient egypt, non monogamy was not only the norm but promoted as a way of life. So was homosexuality. 

If we were designed to be monogamists, then married people wouldn't lust after other people, wouldn't fantasize about other people, and wouldn't have to ""spice things up"" to keep your relationship from getting boring. 

Nonmonogamy is not a new idea, it's the original idea."

You think you know couple that are monogamous because they don't have sex drives? We're talking healthy humans, not depressed and physically unhealthy. Monogamy has existed for 3000-5000 years. And very loosely back then. Aside from all of this. 

Monogamy is unnatural for humans. Bringing society into it is pointless, as our natural state is to be non monogamous. Humans have attraction to other humans, regardless of their relationship status, we have to put effort to control these desires, hence why it's not natural. If its was natural, there would be no attraction to other people the minute we chose our life partner. Further..... we wouldn't have to put so much effort into a monogamous relationship to keep it interesting and exciting if it were natural. Monogamy has spawned prostitution, strip clubs, porn, rape, domestic violence, adultery, and misogyny. If you don't see this, you maybe need to continue your education a little bit. The first step to gender equality is smash this unnatural state of til death do is part, because there is no bigger double standard"

In order to create a vaccine, a virus must first exist. In order for a virus to exist, it needs a host, in this case people. Many people will get the virus before the vaccine gets created. Then the vaccine is created and administered. 

So which stopped the virus? 
The vaccine? No

Herd immunity stopped the vaccine,and when you use herd immunity, the virus stands no chance. When you vaccinate, the results are unstable, less than satisfactory, and must be repeated. 

Your mom has lived through probably many decades of vaccination  and has seen first hand reactions that you read in books.

When we love we love hard but we need someone who understands us.....we need to understand ourselves first. 

I've been struggling and I will continue to struggle because bpd is not curable, you just have to learn how to deal with it. 

Stay put and deal with it or leave and remain in solitude, meeting only a few people at a time, and people like you.... likeminded and troubled to a degree.
