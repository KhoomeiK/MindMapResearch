lamictal,fqzdm1a,t3_ghyn9l,1589765152.0,"Revisit these thoughts in a week.
i have these thoughts all the time but comes a time when i get like out the spell and realize ive been conditioned by my mind to sabotage myself, and worry and somehow and for some reason not get better.

It comes in waves, i used to not tell what was real or not. 

Now i can at least have a week of clarity at least. Because i just started 150mg


But its still a way to go, i get lost in this spell of rapid cycling, that my mind just makes up this whole scenario of what my life is thanks to the what ifs. But its full of lies.


Clarity, ive longed for it. And it seems like its working.
And i seem to know the truth for a while and in longer periods of time. The feeling is clarity, and it feels just as what you imagine when you beg for it. Relief.

I would say give it a time until your first week of 150mg 

And if you see no change and truly realize you want to try to live your life without medication. Then ask if you can slowly come down of the medication. Very sure in a clear state of mind, because if you can truly decide that, then you can be just as patient and truly want to get better.
Because living without medication and even with medication, you still need to fight to stay better. Not just be better but to grasp it."

And  Very true. We feel vulnerable and put up this sortof defense. But when one makes us comfortable then they can see the anguish and suffering. I used tojust start crying without even starting to talk about things, part of it was some sort of relief because i was finally being able to talk about it but at the same time i felt so sad for myself for being in that position"

Im now trying lamictal, and i seem to feel things getting better, but i still feel like its just a random pick. My doctor always just quickly asks and doesnt let me tell him. As if they assume they know exactly what i need."
