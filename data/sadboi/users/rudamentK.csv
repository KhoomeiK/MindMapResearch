ffxiv,fq1sviz,t3_ggb5ni,1589048815.0,"1. Hrothgar - Helion
2. Was formally a Samurai in Stormblood. Now a full fledged Gunbreaker
3. Really enjoy the Hrothgar lore so I chose something that hopefully doesn't stray to far from their lore.

My hrothgar, along with just about all the citizens of Bozja, had been displaced leading him to seek justice for the annihilation of his home town. He can seem disconnected at times, hearing the cries of those who he had to leave behind as a young hrothgar. No longer the fledgling hrothgar he once was, his heart has hardened and temperament emboldened by the scales of justice. After traveling all the way from Ilsabard to Ala Mhigo, he made one last trek into Ul'dah.

Seeing the corruption of the Ul'dah firsthand, he knew this wouldn't be a home for him and again set out to find another venue leading him to scrounge up whatever gil he made doing various jobs and employed a caravan to Gridania leading to the very first cutscene. 

4. There's a certain retainer employed by him who he does fancy but unfortunately, has little experience with love interests; maybe one day it will blossom into something more than unrequited love. In the Scions, he met this odd fellow who had a bizarre way of speaking, almost riddle-like at times. And that just enchanted the star-struck hrothgar. He also met a cat lady with outlandishly strong magics who could assumedly raze an entire town to the ground if she so desired so, you know... is it getting hot in here? But so far, it seems that another Hrothgar has her heart... and he's cute too! So many beautiful faces but not enough time. 

5. Zenos. Never has this WoL been put through the wringer as much as the numerous battles between Zenos. At the mercy of Zenos more than once, this hrothgar felt as hopeless as he was to save the countless innocents in Bozja. How could he liberate anything if he couldn't even overcome this seemingly insurmountable challenge? It was then, that this hrothgar, known so far as a brave and talented warrior, was frightened by another. 

6. All Saints Wake. Story telling was a favorite pastime of this hrothgar in Bozja. His favorite stories were horror stories. He could occasionally be found at the bibliotheca in Bozja reading tales of horror.

7. How Far I'll Go. Very powerful song that could be said to be a driving force behind this hrothgar's yearn for exploration. He was a very sheltered fledgling in Bozja.

8. Emet. This hrothgar understands what it's like to lose people, but you can't just go murdering millions that you think are beneath you. 

9. Urianger and Allisaie. Story and tea time with Urianger is better than sitting with a book in your hand. You just have to refill your tea or risk falling asleep by his soothing story telling abilities.  Allisaie because she always needs to be doing something and loves the hrothgar's company. 

10. Loves food and loves cooking! Was always caught stealing food from his Academia's food hall in Bozja."

residentevil,fmil1nm,t1_fmh7bqn,1586111705.0,"Someone at Capcom said ""make him a doggo"" and that person singlehandedly ruined Nemesis for me personally. Like, his original second form is much more frightening (especially with his sudden entrance in the clock tower) and although it was actually easier than his first, it still looked ten times better than doggo Nemesis. 

Honestly, just another discrepancy in a list of discrepancies I have with the game. Not to say I hate it or anything, just a lot weird game design choices."

residentevil,fmflaf1,t1_fmf19ae,1586029624.0,"It always triggers but some dev thought it would be a nice idea to have Nemesis start 3ft. away from you *as soon as cutscene ends* so a lot people, including me, got punched which abruptly cuts the dialogue short.

In the original, they were fast but weak so you only really find yourself in trouble if you were fighting two or more or were low enough in health that they just one hit killed you from across the room. Now I just focus on moving pass them trying to take as less damage as possible."
residentevil,fmd10v0,t1_fmctngr,1585956967.0,I enjoyed it but only cause I went in with little expectations. But you're absolutely right. There's little content and Nemesis is a huge letdown.

The editor comes with a manual, I believe, and that manual was basically a bible for me when I was doing it during middle school. I don’t do any level building now but I still play custom levels every now and then and if you wanna build those huge complex modern levels, you’ll have to download Next Gen Level Editor (NGLE) which was an updated version of the old editor that allowed you to do more stuff that you weren’t able to with the old one. 

It’s been a while so I don’t know if that’s what authors are still using but, you’ll have to learn what you can do with that editor as well. So really, maybe a few weeks, really depends on how fast you work to learn everything. I would recommend going through the manual that comes with the old editor and go through it as I believe it even helps you make your own first level to help make sure you know the editor like the back of your hand. Then, download NGLE and go to Skribblerz.com where they provide a lot of guides and tutorials for it. Happy building!"

Even if they don’t want to make a new animation, they should switch the sprinting animation with the running animation. Holding our katana out to the side is a tad more reasonable than all the way at the back."

The worst is when it hasn’t popped in quite a while so you get to this nice craft/leve and 2 seconds into it, the dungeon is suddenly ready to go."

LIKE, YOU SAW ME PULL THE BOSS, YOU SAW ME POSITION MYSELF, I’M ALREADY INCREASING MY ENMITY; WHY DECIDE TO MT 10-20 SECONDS INTO THE FIGHT?! IF YOU WANTED TO TANK, JUST PUT ON STANCE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TRIAL/RAID OR TELL ME. THIS HAPPENED AT LEAST 3 TIMES THIS WEEK IN MY ROULETTES AND ENDED UP SHIRKING AND LETTING IT GO."
