Broadway,fnp925v,t1_fnnp8aq,1587141363.0,"> stealing it takes money out of artists’ pockets 

Does it? Think about it. The people going through the trouble of finding and watching bootlegs are people who don’t have the means to travel to New York and/or buy Broadway tickets. If these people aren’t going to be able to go anyway, what’s the harm in allowing them to view the show (and, maybe, become a fan of it in the process). What money will be lost if a 14-year-old who lives outside of the US and can’t come to America watches a bootleg of the show?  

You could also say that bootlegs will harm future ticket sales, but nobody will watch a bootleg of a show, enjoy it, and turn down the opportunity to see the show live. Take me, for example. I live in New York. I’ve also watched the Hamilton bootleg. Why? Because I do not have “buy tickets to Hamilton on Broadway” money to freely spend at the moment. Despite this, I still enter the ticket lottery regularly, I save money when I can, and I keep an eye out for any opportunities I can find, because a grainy video from 4 years ago cannot compared to seeing something live onstage. Watching the Hamilton bootleg did not make me want to see Hamilton less. All it did was make me even more interested in the show.

Take Heathers as an example of this. Heathers lived in relative obscurity after its off-Broadway run, but it became known through the bootleg of it that spread through the internet, causing it to be massively popular and wildly successful during its West End run. If nobody had heard about Heathers or seen that bootleg, it likely would not have seen the success it did.

There’s also the case of watching bootlegs of shows that are actually impossible to see. Who is being harmed by me watching a bootleg of Tuck Everlasting, a show that ran for six weeks and closed when I was 15 years old and 200 miles away from the city? Who will lose money if I view a bootleg of the Falsettos revival, with its 14-week limited run that I will never be able to see live (in that form, at least) because it closed four years ago?

Theatre should not be an exclusive and inaccessible art form. If Broadway is truly meant to be for the people, then the people should be able to view them. I understand why ticket prices for every show can’t be $20. I understand why every single show can’t get a professional recording and distribute it. But until we find a way to effectively make Broadway accessible to people who can’t afford to pay hundreds or thousands to experience it, this is the best way."

AskLGBT,fmz1wh4,t1_fmgp5xn,1586503288.0,"This comment right here basically proves that the answer is *yes, we are.*

First of all “stick to dating members of the opposite sex” means, essentially, “repress a part of your identity for the comfort of other people”. Of course, some bi people would be perfectly fine with that arrangement, because their attraction means more towards the opposite side, and that’s valid and doesn’t make them any less bi. Some, though, like me, would not. What if a bi girl were to fall for another girl, but because she has to keep from being oppressed, she decides to ignore these feelings and, gasp, **oppress herself.** Bi people are a minority and, as members of the LGBTQ community, are oppressed right along with the rest. In countries where same-sex marriage isn’t legalized, it’s just as illegal for two lesbians to get married as it is for two bi guys to get married. Homophobia doesn’t care if you happen to “stick to the other side”. This has the exact same energy as “I don’t mind gay people as long as they don’t shove it down my throat”. You’re basically implying that bi people have to pretend to be straight in order to make themselves digestible for society."

I was in an abusive relationship as a teenager, and my mental health is still suffering for it. However, it’s not an excuse to invalidate and trivialize other people’s suffering or to hold yourself above criticism and manipulate the people around you. Something I experienced for a long time (and still sometimes do) was the feeling that “I didn’t have it that bad so it doesn’t count as abuse”. It’s something that a lot of abusers put into their victims’ minds, making the abused person think that they should be *grateful* because it could always be worse. There’s a decent chance your friend is going through this on her own, and you are absolutely not helping.

I completely understand and sympathize with feeling alone and “broken” because of what’s happened to you. Really, truly, I do. That being said, you can’t continue to demonize your own friends and push them away. This is a manipulative and narcissistic attitude, whether you realize it or not. Your friend is not your therapist, and her mental health matters just as much as you do. Even licensed, trained, professional therapists often need therapy of their own to cope with the emotional burden of their jobs. Imagine how your friend, only a year older than you, must feel. It sounds to me like cares about you a lot, but she can’t be your full-time emotional punching bag. It’s not healthy, for you or her. Please talk to your parents about seeing a professional."
