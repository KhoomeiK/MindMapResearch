mentalhealth,escl63f,t1_esa1km8,1561832219.0,"Thankyou for your input! I really appreciate the help! Although I am worried for the session, especially since what I do think I have is schizophrenia and that doesn't help with 'describing' my symptoms. I would love to read up on all the different types of therapy, but I don't have the attention span to do it. Do you think it would be fine if I went in that office knowing nothing at all and only answering what I've been asked? I'm really afraid that they might make the wrong diagnosis. I can only picture myself on that seat completely unaware of what is happening and extremely nervous to the point that I only have the courage to be polite and ask a lot of questions.
So, do you have any tips for what I should do to control my nervousness, be honest to the therapist, and not be distracted by everything? 
Also, how do you think you should answer questions? How honest should you be to the therapist? 
What do you think i should know beforehand? I'm so nervous I think I'll forget about all of my symptoms when I reach the place."
