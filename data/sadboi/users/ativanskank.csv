AnorexiaNervosa,fqjpg3p,t1_fqjnpd7,1589413288.0,exactly. it used to give me motivation to continue not eating
AnorexiaNervosa,fqjihlm,t3_gj54id,1589410400.0,yes but i also derive pleasure from it because in my mind the hungrier i get the skinnier i get. i would always interpret feelings of hunger as like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs all my fat being burned‚Äù

bipolar,fqa6g31,t1_fq8z5fa,1589213657.0,the calorie requirement is because only 20% of the medication gets absorbed if u take it on an empty stomach. i hated it too because i struggled with anorexia but it definitely has a higher efficacy when taken with food.
bipolar,fqa67vn,t3_ghh8sk,1589213544.0,"i‚Äôve talked about this before, but i have bipolar ii and i‚Äôve been on latuda for almost two years with it having little to no effect. i tried trileptal but that did nothing except give me nightmares and then i got put on zoloft which doesn‚Äôt seem to be doing much anyways. i‚Äôm currently in an outpatient program so my current prescriber is the one from the program, not the one i usually go to. i‚Äôve asked her multiple times to change my meds and she keeps refusing saying that since i‚Äôm doing well (what i think is a hypomanic episode) that we shouldn‚Äôt change anything. it‚Äôs so annoying because i know at any moment i could fall into a depressive episode and she refuses to listen. also, when i asked her for another script for my clonazepam that i got (technically it was for anxiety but i used it when i had crying fits) and she absolutely refused to prescribe a benzo and gave me this antihistamine instead which does absolutely nothing. idk what to do, should i wait it out until i leave the out patient program or should i have my parents intervene?"

again i‚Äôve never hit 3rd plat so i‚Äôm speaking from what i‚Äôve read. i recommend enjoying the second plat for as long as possible. it‚Äôs supposed to be really hard to appreciate after u go higher."

bipolar,fkazu2q,t3_fh3wae,1584023178.0,"this same exact thing happened to me the other week. it was somewhat of a different activity, but the main idea was to identify the people in your life that you‚Äôre close to/trust and can go to for support

and i didn‚Äôt have difficulty adding people at first, but after i added the first two people i realised, do i really feel close to these people? we just exchange face photos on snap at this point and if we talk it‚Äôs nothing of great depth. 

from there i started thinking about all of the people in my life, and that i didn‚Äôt feel genuinely close to ANY of them. like they‚Äôre in my life but they‚Äôre not. i don‚Äôt talk to any of them about how i‚Äôm feeling. 

from there i just walked out of the room and cried in the bathroom while peeing in a cup for my biweekly drug screen. 

what scares me is that my last day of the outpatient program is today. what happens when i leave and have no one to talk to besides my therapist once a week?"
