Also I’m sure they don’t think their better off with out you; you don’t have anything that really proves that.

Meditation,f6vn13z,t3_dt9es0,1573191643.0,"I also had a terrible experience with psilocybin. You should read about some of the adverse side effects of meditation and u might find that they psychedelics and meditation have some definite connections.for instance you can experience an ego death with psychedelics, which is what some people shoot for. Just like meditation is traditional meant for reaching enlightenment and on that journey you slowly dissolve your ego. So It’s not to crazy that your experiencing that connection or at least I know I’ve had the same types of feelings and fears- feeling like I don’t exist in particular. how long have you been meditating? Personally I’m trying to work through these types of problems myself, but from some things I’ve read online I believe you could call this ego backlash. There was a YouTube video that talked about the dark side of meditation that made me decide to take a break from meditation."

Anyways you should start with one thing you need to change and work from there. You’ll just overwhelm yourself if you try to do them all at once."
