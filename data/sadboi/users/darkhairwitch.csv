AskReddit,fjhvd3r,t3_fdcbl8,1583355746.0,People at work that bitch the whole damn day about the work they have to do. I sit next to one of those. It's awful to have to listen to that everyday for 8 hours.

knitting,evy614j,t3_clrphz,1564923664.0,Oh wow! This looks amazing! I've been knitting for a while now but haven't been successful at double knitting. Tried to knit a pair of socks with a Galaga theme for my boyfriend but wasn't able to work with more than one yarn and ended up with a super tight mess of a sock lol.
AskReddit,es616le,t1_es5q0mz,1561637217.0,Yep yep yep. My mom was extremely overprotecting and ever since I became an adult I always feel like life is eating me whole.
AskReddit,es2zzit,t3_c5hyh4,1561548784.0,"I've been battling with anxiety and depression for a few years now. It has been worst but currently it immobilizes me. I'm scared to do anything to go on with my life. I graduated from medschool in a different country than the one I'm living right now. I tried to get certified here but I took the tests once and failed and got too scared to keep trying. I thought about getting into nursing school but every time I think about going and find out what are the requirements I get so anxious that I end up not going. So now, I'm working in a call center, not even making enough money to be able to support myself, which depresses me. I guess it's a cycle."
AskReddit,er4y42h,t1_er4k7lf,1560513040.0,This right here. Just the fact that we HAVE to be alert at all times because anyone can hurt us whenever they want. It's just disgusting how society dismisses people that come forward after going through any type of abuse.
AskReddit,er4xc2f,t1_er3xs58,1560512448.0,"It's not only annoying, it's painfull too. When I was younger I loved doing aerobics and dancing but I had to wear super tight sports bras to be able to. Plus you tend to have back issues if you have big breasts."

bettafish,ep7x12s,t1_ep7gf8z,1559087405.0,Thanks! I'll definitely do that next time. It's my first time trying to photograph him.
