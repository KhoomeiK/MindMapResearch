guitarpedals,fprv8r0,t3_gblrd5,1588862694.0,"For od right now I use a Westwood as a low gain boost type pedal into a BD-2w which is set more mid gain.  I feel like the more heavier stuff I play the Westwood doesn‚Äôt quite fit and I want a little beefier sound that still sounds good clean.

Thinking of replacing either the Westwood w a Plumes or replacing both the Westwood and BD-2w w a Plumes.  Good move?  

I‚Äôm thinking I could either use the Plumes for both low and mid gain and take the BD-2w off the board entirely and clear up some space.  Or I could use the BD-2w as a clean boost into the Plumes which I‚Äôd use for mid gain stuff.   Wondering if anyone has any thoughts on this or tried it themselves."

This one job I‚Äôve been interviewing with for almost a month, I did a 3 hour final interview last week.  So I thought I was done interviewing w them, but this week they came back and contacted the recruiter saying  - We like him.  He has passed all the tech screens we are just not sure if he wants to work at our company or just needs a job.  (For the record, this is my top choice so far, I guess I didn‚Äôt make that clear to them).  

They are saying they think I‚Äôd be a good fit for one particular team and and want me to meet w the teams manager - obstensibly to get an idea of my enthusiasm for the company and team and vice versa.  The recruiter assured me that I had passed all tech screens and this was a conversation and not a tech screen.  

What do you think is going on?  It‚Äôs taking so long w this company and I can‚Äôt see how this interview is not a tech sceeen."
