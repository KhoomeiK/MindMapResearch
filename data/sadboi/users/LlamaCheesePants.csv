OCD,fmdxywq,t3_fumq98,1585981737.0,"All of the time.  A month or two ago I was this way with Luigi’s Mansion 3.  I seriously got into a bit of a depression after I beat it because it was over.  And now that the new Animal Crossing game is out, I’m obsessing over that.  I literally play it from the time I get up (around 3 PM with my horrendous sleep schedule) til around 2 AM usually, and then I will lay there and watch videos of people playing it.  And when I’m not doing that, I’m laying here trying to decide how to decorate my island next and trying to figure out where to move certain objects, and blah blah blah.  It’s bad.  😂 But it’s at least helping to keep me calm and distracted with everything going on in the world right now, so that’s a plus, I guess.  🤷🏻‍♀️"
OCD,fmdxpg1,t3_fumokm,1585981461.0,"I know this feeling completely.  Everywhere I look I see another article or video about covid-19, and people in my life pestering me to disinfect everything multiple times a day (I know it’s just because they worry about me, but I cant take that pressure), and I just cant take much more of it anymore.  I used to have a disinfecting compulsion, and I’m so afraid that I’ll end up backtracking and getting it again because of this constant pestering.  I of course do disinfect things regularly like we’re supposed to, but you know.  I’m just getting so overwhelmed and stressed out by all of this stuff.  Sorry for the rant there, haha."

I watched a video a few days ago where one guy was doing everything he could to get the pink anteater Snooty to leave his island, and when he finally succeeded, I felt so bad for her! I also feel bad when I make my characters upset or angry.  I know they’re just pixels, but I get so lonely sometimes that they feel like they’re my real friends.  😂😣"

I know if I was still in college, I would be freaking out even more.  Just try to minimize contact with people as much as you can, and wash your hands and disinfect things thoroughly.

I usually have to do it at least 3 or 5 times if I end up rewinding a video for some reason or another.  It’s irritating.  I dont know much about trying to cope with it, though, except to try and ignore those urges.  It’s way easier said than done, I know, but that’s about the only way to break the compulsion.

But mostly I get frustrated out of jealousy of how some people can just lay down at night and go to bed without a thought/care in the world.  I wish I could do that, but I have to do all of these stupid little compulsions before I can even think about climbing into bed, let alone go to sleep.

I must have OCD.” I inwardly cringed so much when I heard someone say that.  OCD isnt a joke.

Maybe see if your mom can help you get an appointment with a doctor.  Like I said, being 18, it’s completely up to you if you want to take the medication, and legally she cant stop you.
