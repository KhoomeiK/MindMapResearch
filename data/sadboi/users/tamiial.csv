BreakUp,f28rdp7,t3_dcdhpk,1570068812.0,"I feel the same.. I always question myself the same question, the saddest part we are still following each other on twitter he tweets stuff about  memories doesn't mean anything to him anymore, girls all over him now and I sit here alone feeling bad about myself.. we broke up 2 weeks ago. sometimes I wish I didn't get involve with him a whole year vanished like it was nothing.. it sucks but I guess people can stop loving you if they decided to, love is a choice after all. he knows I'm an introvert and a loner he knew I would break apart but he did it anyway. I imagine anyone can leave so easily without feeling a thing it seems simple .."
