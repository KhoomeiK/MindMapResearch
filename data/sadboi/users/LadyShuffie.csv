AskReddit,fnqq9gj,t1_fnorki5,1587169861.0,No you're right. It's just.. I think it's easy to tell the difference between inexperienced and nervous and being a bravado. I think people notice and appreciate genuinity in a partner.

relationship_advice,fm45jn6,t1_fm3pdzo,1585747028.0,"That is what my ex did to me. He was derailed enough to pour his antidepressants (which I later learned weren't actually antidepressants- it was just medicine for his acne!) down the drain and announcing that ""I don't need these anymore because of you"" and proceeded to use that to manipulate me into a relationship with him. People like this are nothing but obsessive and controlling- but they use emotions instead of fists. 

I was stuck for 3 years, but I am now happily married to a man that is genuine and builds me up as much as I build him up. There is hope. Get out and find a relationship that strengthens both you and your partner."
