The turning point for me was realizing school was starting and I needed to get my shit together (daily smoker for about two years). Also I realized how bad weed was for my mental health, shit keeps you from addressing problems, and that isn’t worth it. Feel free to dm me if you wanna talk about quitting or at least cutting back use. 

Oh also CBD is amazing on its own. After a week of not smoking I started using CBD flower, stuff helped curb cravings, I could sleep, and I could do my homework even if I smoked it."
