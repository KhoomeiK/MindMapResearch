SkincareAddiction,fn6b8na,t1_fn66wjh,1586694239.0,"Yes thats true, i think my moisture barrier is almost repaired and due to slow shipping i thought it would be fine. Ill probably order some stuff as suggested by other users and continue focusing on hydration until it arrives."
SkincareAddiction,fn6b2c4,t1_fn6910d,1586694074.0,"Thanks for the detailed advice. I really appreciate it.

My skin is/was dehydrated, after focusing on hydration recently i would say my moisture barrier is almost repaired. I layer the toner at night and kiku in the morning. I was thinking of trying the hada labo gokujyun after my current toner runs out since its so cheap here and everyone on sca raves about it lol.

The products that i was going to get wouldnt come until next month at least due to slow postal service these days, so i thought maybe my skin would be ok by the time they arrived. But you're right i should start with the least irritating products."
SkincareAddiction,fn5ht51,t3_fzpqw0,1586665240.0,"Hello, i am wanting to add some products from The Ordinary to help get rid of blackheads, acne scars, and deal with overall dullness of my skin.

My skin type is oily and dehydrated, and this is my current routine:

AM: rinse with warm water, Melano CC serum, Kikumasamune skin care emulsion, Biore sunscreen
PM: double cleanse with drugstore oil cleanser and Softymo hyaluronic face wash, Kiehl's calendula toner, MJ care peeling pads, Hada Labo Perfect Gel
(I live in Japan so i use mostly Japanese products)

I am eyeing the Niacinamide, salicylic acid mask, lactic acid, and maybe start using retinol? I am not too sure which products would work with my current routine. I will replace the MJ care peeling pads with whichever exfoliant(s) I get. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated !"
PetAdvice,fmumuxf,t3_fxh65s,1586394529.0,"It looks like conjunctivitis to me, my cat gets it sometimes. You need to take your cat to the vet ASAP. He needs meds. You cannot treat it at home, because you need special meds for cats for this infection. Its a pretty common thing for cats so he will be fine, but he needs to be seen by a vet. He must feel so uncomfortable! Hope he gets better soon."

PetAdvice,fjxelhn,t1_fjxcknj,1583670288.0,I dont think its anything to worry about. He is probably not feeling 100% and wants some extra love. My cat also would not sit with me usually but during/while recovering from the urine crystals he would always want to cuddle 24/7. Maybe give the vet a call if you are very concerned but I dont think he needs to go in if the vet just saw him a week ago.

AskReddit,fjpfctd,t3_feel1j,1583549339.0,"I work in the travel industry in Japan and coronavirus is fucking us up. Tons of people were supposed to come March and April for cherry blossoms but now we are getting tons cancellations everyday.

Due to the huge drop in sales a bunch of people were laid off at my work and we all got salary cuts. Next week the government is set to pass legislation that allows the PM to declare a state of emergency which I am afraid will do even more damage to the travel industry.."
TMJ,fjnim2c,t3_feetgt,1583508193.0,Hello i was diagnosed in october after my mouth got close locked. The dentist made me use a splint first and it helped  with pain. Then a combination of the splint and what i think was arthrocentesis really helped me open my mouth normally. I can eat burgers just fine now and have almost no pain now.
movingtojapan,fey8xvg,t3_eqwehf,1579442280.0,"Usually your sharehouse will tell you the rules when you sign the contract. Some are more strict than others, and there are usually there are rules concerning sleepovers.

I used oakhouse in 2017 and although the rule was sleepovers allowed 3x a month, no one actually gave a shit if you had people over more than that. Depends on the sharehouse company and your housemates i guess."
CatAdvice,fady0n3,t1_fadtgjl,1575989251.0,I agree with the puppy pads. My 1 yr old kitty was found abandoned in a park and only pees on puppy pads. I figure she was never trained or perhaps kept in a cage with only the puppy pads no litter. I would give the puppy pads a try and then work from there.
movingtojapan,f4kp94x,t1_f4d13yq,1571655701.0,"My company's HR manager is Japanese so he honestly was just satisfied that I had a degree and didnt care about my studies. If the HR person is Japanese just emphasize how global your education was and show off how culturally aware you are and that you have good cross-cultural communication skills. Global, international etc etc are huge buzzwords in Japan right now. Any internships related to the word 'international' also help. I interned at another travel company during my term abroad in Japan which helped me land my current job.

If its an international working environment with minimal technical skills I think having an international studies degree is an asset. You just need to find the right places to apply to. Besides gaijinpot and daijob I've heard that wantedly is good for finding opportunities if you are looking to work at more startup-type companies."
movingtojapan,f4ctg7k,t3_dkao5s,1571533661.0,"Hey I also majored in international studies.

I currently work at a travel agency as a travel consultant which requires minimal Japanese as we deal only with foreign clients. I just honestly searched online a ton and it took me like 1.5 months to find my current job on Daijob. I'm lucky since the company has sustainability department which relates to what I want to do when I go back to Canada, and its a foreign company not Japanese so theres more opportunity for promotions and stuff."

simonfraser,eub367v,t3_cfjybr,1563638576.0,"Look into neighbourhood houses (cedar cottage is a good one, i worked there before). If youre interested in children some neighbourhood houses in Vancouver hire students to be one-on-one workers for kids with special accommodations. I know ppl from psychology, social work, and education who work at neighbourhood houses and they are usually in need of staff. Plus anhbc is pretty reputable so its a good reference lol"

Agoraphobia,er4d8so,t1_er4cz1l,1560487650.0,Thank you for the comment!! My ceremony was yesterday and it went great! As other commenters suggested i did practice some breathing when my mind started to wander during the ceremony. And i did put on some nice smelling essential oil on my wrist! Which im not sure if it helps (placebo effect?) But made me feel good lol
Agoraphobia,er3zcb5,t1_eqxhefy,1560476906.0,It went really well!!! I was panicky and nauseous before going but once i got there and went through it all i was so distracted and happy that i didnt get any panic symptoms!
Agoraphobia,eqqvtew,t1_eqqvi9j,1560234692.0,Thanks so much for the detailed suggestions. I've never done therapy so learning these breathing methods might help! I'll try them out if I remember. I think telling the people running the convocation that I am prone to fainting might make me feel safer too. I hope my fears don't impact my big day too muchðŸ¤ž
Agoraphobia,eqqvn5a,t1_eqppbp2,1560234480.0,Thank you so much. I'll be sure to remind myself that I deserve to enjoy my day. Maybe try to distract myself if my brain decides to tell me I'm going to go crazy lol.
