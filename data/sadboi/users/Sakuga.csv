GooglePixel,fqzk5l3,t1_fqzj64t,1589769100.0,"So I have to disagree with your ""backup"" statement, because when Google first started making phone they were all midranged and they had almost a cult following.

I don't see it going under, I think (at least I'm hoping) that Google is going back to there roots where they had the most success, budget phones that focused on what you needed, not all the fancy bells and whistles. I wonder about the camera tho, if they can keep that top tier in the budget phones. 

No matter what, Apple is making Android look like dog crap right now. The iPhones are such consistently better products/quality/software support/longevity. Just overall they are a better bang for your buck. 

I will agree with you about Google failing to deliver on there entire pixel ecosystem. I am baffled at how horrendous the Pixel Slate is and how we don't have a ""Pixel watch"" to rival the Apple Watch. I remember when the Nexus line was in its hay day we had the Nexus 7 (two generations of it), and a Nexus 10. They were as good as an iPad and half the cost.

That sounds reasonable, but now you're in the standard price range for EVs.

I have no idea the ballpark of what it cost to get started, but probably you would only be able to sell the cars, at cheapest, for $35,000 at the cheapest. Then there's liability, recalls, service, lawsuits, advertising, marketing....man I have no idea how much it would cost.
