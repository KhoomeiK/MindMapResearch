Your boyfriend is definetly gaslighting you, and psychoanalyzing everything you do in order to feel in control. He tries to bring up mental health issues but spins it in a way that says ""you're inferior for having this/ doing this."" Kind of like, ""oh, is that TrIgGerIng you? Do you have pAst IsSues?

relationship_advice,fqracg8,t3_gk4uqc,1589580553.0,"you said your ""heart isn't somehow agreeing"" to leaving her. Yeah fuck that. That's a naive way of thinking. ""Follow your heart"" is pretty much an over-romanticized trope. Human beings didn't survive because they listened to their heart, they lived because they used their brains. Your heart is being dumb right now. Our emotions exist so that we can protect ourselves properly. Pain exists so you get yourself out of danger. Love exists so you can find happiness. But your emotions are betraying you right now. Your emotions are *directly* putting you in the face of danger. They can't be trusted. Y'know, I have severe anxiety and depression. If I only lived according to the whims of my heart, and if I never went through with something just because ""my heart isn't agreeing to it"", I'd be six feet underground by now. You're smart. You're capable. You're a fully grown man. When our hearts are being irrational, it's up to our minds to get us out of that situation so we can fix ourselves. 

Leave.  Dude she will never change because she knows you're weak and she dosen't think you'll leave her. She's been abusing you since day 1, multiple times a day, gaslights you when you bring up the topic...what is it that's making you stay here? The love? This isn't love. Have you heard of the cycle of abuse? Where the victim experiences so much pain everyday that one instance of love from their abuser turns into something euphoric? The hungrier you are, the better your food tastes. I don't know if this is what you're experiencing. I don't know *what* you're experiencing. There is literally ZERO difference from this being a slap in the balls to a slap in the face.

 Would you still be with your girlfriend if her method was to punch you in the face, rather than your balls? Why is it okay just because the location has changed? 

Do you think any sane person behaves this way? If this is what you think normal relationships are like, or what normal people behave like, you're dead wrong. This is the first time I've heard about a partner finding pleasure in punching a man's balls. I've been on this sub for a long time too, and I've seen some weird shit. Your girlfriend is not only abusing you, she's crazy. No respectable woman I know likes slapping men's balls. 

I get that she ignored the article that you read out to her, but aren't you just as bad? How can you still stay even when knowing that the damage could be permanent? How can you have this little self-respect? How can she have that little respect? Why is her ""right to have fun"" in the relationship more important than your right to live healthily? Why the fuck aren't you angry right now? Why the fuck are you letting her get away with this? You know this is fucking wrong. You need to get therapy for this. Also, what she's doing is a crime and is considered domestic abuse. She's causing intentional bodily harm. You can downplay it however much you want in your mind, but the truth is that your girlfriend is abusive, manipulative, and does not give a shit about you as long she can mistreat you for her own pleasure."

Yet for him, your feelings don't matter, it's all clearly a fucking joke because it's just one cookie, why does he have to care right?

This isn't a problem because he ate the cookie. I'd tell him that. I'd tell him that you're not mad at him for eating the cookie, but you're mad because

1. He dosen't listen to you. He ignores you. Your words are meaningless to him. You *specifically* told him not to touch those, and he did. Your wishes didn't even matter. He might try to deflect by saying ""Jesus, it was just a cookie!"" but ask him if he can deny that he prioritized his desire for a cookie over your words. Ask him if he can deny that he completely disregarded your wishes to fulfill his own desires. 

2. The lack of understanding and empathy. He demonstrated that he literally did not care about the effort you put into making that cookie, and the hard work you did. He clearly went against your words. He clearly was in the wrong. And you were understandably upset because you specifically told him not to, and he did. What would it cost him to apologize? Instead, he acted as if *you* were the one to blame, when clearly you did absolutely nothing wrong. Like, does he even care that you felt upset and cheated? Does he even care that you felt like your hard work was ruined? It's all fine and dandy as long as he can have his cookies, even if you're hurt over it, right?

3. A complete lack of respect of your boundaries and your things. Those cookies were yours. You made them. He had absolutely no right to them. If you wanted to, you could have just never made him extra cookies. His sense of entitlement is overwhelming. He didn't lift a single finger, while you spent *10* hours making those. And somehow he can come and do whatever he wants with the products of your hard work, and it's okay? At this point I'd tell him that you don't know if you want to cook for him again. I'd buy all the materials for your meals with your own money and live that way. If he cannot respect your food, and your property, then he isn't entitled to it anymore. 

I'd tell him that while for him it's just a cookie, to you his actions after the fact demonstrated a complete lack of respect and sympathy, and that it's broken your trust in how he'll handle bigger matters from now.

relationship_advice,fpt2ayf,t3_geu2br,1588883628.0,"I hope you read this. This sounds like trauma bonding to me. You can look up more stuff about trauma bonding, but I feel like you might be able to relate to the description. 

It's basically like his love is your drug. He first ropes you in with his love, and he's sweet, and nice, but without you noticing he'll be isolating you from your family, your friends, *he* will become the center of your attention. With your situation, you've been through *so* much with him, its almost like he's your baby. You've ""brought him back from the brink"", so to say, You're like his savior. You've *learnt* how to deal with the abuse because at the end of it you feel like you can save him. You've spent so much of your effort and energy on this man. At this point, your world is probably halfway rotating about him. I may be wrong, but for most people in your situation, spending so much effort into *one* person means that they don't have space for any others. So he's probably your main source of love, validation, and fullfillment, because he takes up so much space he's probably pushed everyone else out.

You know how food tastes better when you're hungry? Or how home seems magical when you've been away for a long time? Or how you appreciate your bed more when you're stuck at a long day in work? That's kind of how love works in an abusive situation. There will be dark periods where you stay, you stay because you miss that love, and when you do get it, it tastes sweeter, even if in reality it's not all that great. 

You get conditioned like a dog. You learn that if you stay through the hardest parts of the abuse, and the darkest parts, at the end you'll be rewarded with a love that seems better than anything else you can find. I remember seeing someone else's post on here about trauma bonding, calling the victim the junkie and the abuser's love the drug. You're addicted to it because it tastes so good, and you'll do anything to get it, you'll endure biting, and pain, and anything to get it, and while your life falls apart all you're thinking of is the one time he said that he loves you so much ""he never wants to hurt you again"". 

Again, I'm not a professional, so I *highly* reccomend that you seek the advice of a professional. You can't trust your feelings right now. Your body and your emotions are *wired* to protect you from danger, and right now something is wrong. You can't trust feelings that put you in the face of danger time and time again. You need to seek help so you can fix those feelings and get back on track. You don't have to do it all by yourself. There's resources out there. Don't feel hopeless. 

>I know he loves me and I love him as well. When we he is sober our relationship is awesome!! We bond so much. He confessed he really loves and never wants to hurt me again.

I don't think that love is enough to fix any of this. Yeah, you can love him, and he can love you, but expecting that alone to be a good enough reason to stay in a relationship is naive. There are couples who seperate despite being deeply in love. If you truly loved him, and if he truly loved you, you would both do what's best for each other. What you need right now is to be away from him. It's to build yourself back up again. And what he needs right now, is to be away from you. 

This isn't a one way street. Breaking up isn't just for your own benefit, he needs to be away from you so he can get the help he needs. You're the one saving him all the time, you're the one that brings him back from homelessness, addiction, and everything. 

Right now, he dosen't have a single reason as to why he should sober up and save himself. He knows you won't leave, so all of the financial, criminal, and emotional problems that arise for him, you will take care of it. If he drinks and does whatever he wants, you're still gonna stay. Tell me even one reason why he should change. Love? How much more love can you possibly have? You've already given him so much love. And it's clear that it's not fixing him. You know the cliche saying, doing the same thing over and over while expecting different results is the definition of insanity? This is the third time it's happened. You can stay and keep repeating the cycle of insanity, but I don't think you want that deep down in your heart. You're doing the same thing over and over again, and it's clear that it's not working. Doing it *harder* won't change anything. Even if you love him harder, help him harder, support him harder, you're *still* doing the same thing. He won't change this way. It simply isn't possible, because there is no reason *for* him to.



>I already miss him but he treats me like complete shit when he’s drunk. What’s wrong with me? I feel so stupid and weak

Because he made you weak. This is the trauma bonding I was talking about. You feel this way because you're a junkie and he gives your the drugs you need. Do you actually miss him, or do you only miss the good times? The times when you were rewarded with his love for waiting through the abuse like an obedient dog? 

Another thing you have to realize is that your boyfriend abusing you when drunk is not an excuse for staying. I'm not going to touch upon wether it means he's a good person or a bad person, because I'm talking about you. You know, it's not like tornadoes rip out buildings from the ground and kill people because they *want* to. Would you stand in the face of a tornado, saying ""well it isn't really aware of what it's doing, I'm sure it has good intentions, so I'll stay right here."" So why is it any different when he's under the influence? Wether he has good intentions or not, wether its him or the alcohol, what does it matter? 

Don't put yourself in the face of danger. It dosen't matter if he loves you, or if you love him, you need to be alive for anything to matter in the first place. And with the way this is going, at some point down the line you're not going to be happy, and I doubt if you'll even be alive. Like I said, this won't stop. And he won't change. It's simple really, use logic and you'll realize that his behavior has *never* changed. Despite everything you've done. Nothing has changed. And despite everything you will do, nothing will ever change. If you stay. 

If you see a tornado coming down the street, don't stay. And if you know that your boyfriend has the potential to kill you when he's drunk, don't stay. 

You have to keep in mind that the reason why you want to stay is not a good reason at all. You have to keep in mind that your emotions are untrustworthy right now, and that they're betraying you. You have to keep in mind that the abuse has changed the way you think, it's forced you to trauma bond, it's forced you to succumb to it's control. You know how someone addicted to heroin misses it despite the fact that it's killing them? Treat your boyfriend like that heroin. Imagine him like that in your minds eye. That way you can come up with the answer to why you're feeling this way. And you can seek the help you need. At this point, your abuser isn't the one holding you back anymore. He could be locked up for a long time if you wanted him to be. It's you that's in your own way. You can do this. Good luck."

3) if you underreact to this, after saying you'd *kill* him if he did it, your words will loose all their meaning. I have enough self-respect to stand by my words. (obviously I'm not telling you to commit murder) but if he dosen't face serious repercussions for this, well, then you're basically okay with your words being meaningless now.

I wouldn't confront him about this just yet. Save all the videos. Screen-record them or something. Screenshot the website page. Screenshot his username. Screenshot his interactions with other accounts on the page. Screenshot everything. Then email these to yourself, or to a secret email account. If you're gonna confront him about it, id start the conversation when he isn't home so I can have his confessions on text. I'd screenshot those texts and send them to my email as well. 

Then talk to your lawyer about your options. Tell him the evidence that you have. 

*Then* confront your husband. That way, he can't trap you somehow, because you've already taken necessary precautions.

relationship_advice,fppi4zg,t3_geoi97,1588802703.0,"I could understand if that girl meant that it might be hard to get friends and girlfriends because most people just don't know sign language. However, if she meant that you're any less of a person, or any less desirable because of that, she's dead wrong. I'm a 16 year old girl, and I *know* I'd be completely fine with dating a mute person, and I think most girls be would too, because they're not that different, really? 

I think the biggest hurdle is just the fact that you won't be able to communicate as easily, and most people don't know sign language so it just lessens the dating pool.

And it isn't impossible. I need you to think that it isn't impossible. I know it seems scary, but one thing I've learnt is that if you think something is impossible, it actually becomes impossible. If you truly believe in something, the probability of that thing happening heightens. For example, I started beleiving that I was awkward and gross to talk to, and that actually caused me to become more awkward in conversations, and I'd make myself sound creepy because of it, whereas before my insecurities, I was able to converse just fine.

As for advice, personally I would work on all other areas first. Like I'd try to go to the gym more, experiment with styles (clothes, hairstyles, accessories ((personally, a boy becomes like 10x hotter to me if they're wearing a chain or a ring))) even hobbies, if you have cool hobbies or if you're really into something that makes you more attractive, all of these things will not only increase your chances, but also give you more confidence and a sense of self-fullfilment, which are all great things! And I hope you truly start trying these things, and enjoy them while you do, there is no feeling better than a sense of accomplishment 

(P.s. if you decide to go to the gym, do extensive research on fitness first. Aimlessly going to the gym will actually make your life worse, (aside from giving you your daily dose of excersice) as you won't see results and it'll cause you to get unmotivated. It's important to experiment in the gym as well, along with your diet. You can speak to your parents about this and I'm sure they'll be supportive.) 

As for the actual difference itself. It's great that you can use sign language, but I have a feeling a lot of people at your school can't use that. What I would do is I'd make a really cute/cool notebook that you can carry around to write in. You can be really creative with this, have the notebook itself be something that'll catch people's attention. Keep in mind that I don't have any experience with the disabled and I don't know if this could potentially be bad advice, but I feel like a notebook like that could be an icebreaker/ conversation starter, and it could steer the conversation away from 'oh, you can't talk...?' to 'whoa that's a cool notebook' 

 And like other people have said, you can use your phone too, but I kind of detest the text-to-speech tools because they make me feel uncomfortable, i prefer just looking at text by itself, and the notebook serves a different purpose from the phone, like I said

As for the people at your school, all hope isn't lost. You can still make friends when school reopens next year!  If you can't make friends, that's okay too. Sometimes making friends is about finding the right situation, not about being the right person. I don't think the people at school avoid you because they hate you, it's probably because they're also socially inept kids as well. 

I know it's hard to function in a society without a physical voice. But that dosen't mean you're less than, and it dosen't mean that life is over. Even if other people don't notice it, keep being a great and kind person by yourself, and hone your skills by yourself. That way, you can grow and grow, and one day people will look at you, astonished that they've been ignoring such an amazing person all along. 

But still, don't be too hard on yourself. And don't lose hope. You're only 13. Some people have never found their partners until they were like 27. That's about...14 years away. That's like 14 years for you to grow as a person too. So don't get anxious if you can't find a date soon.  And if you need someone to talk to, pm me! I'm always free. Good luck:)"
relationship_advice,fppi45h,t3_geoi97,1588802691.0,"I could understand if that girl meant that it might be hard to get friends and girlfriends because most people just don't know sign language. However, if she meant that you're any less of a person, or any less desirable because of that, she's dead wrong. I think I'd be completely fine with dating a mute person, and I think most people would too, because they're not that different, really? 

I think the biggest hurdle is just the fact that you won't be able to communicate as easily, and most people don't know sign language so it just lessens the dating pool.

And it isn't impossible. I need you to think that it isn't impossible. I know it seems scary, but one thing I've learnt is that if you think something is impossible, it actually becomes impossible. If you truly believe in something, the probability of that thing happening heightens. For example, I started beleiving that I was awkward and gross to talk to, and that actually caused me to become more awkward in conversations, and I'd make myself sound creepy because of it, whereas before my insecurities, I was able to converse just fine.

As for advice, personally I would work on all other areas first. Like I'd try to go to the gym more, experiment with styles (clothes, hairstyles, accessories ((personally, a boy becomes like 10x hotter to me if they're wearing a chain or a ring))) even hobbies, if you have cool hobbies or if you're really into something that makes you more attractive, all of these things will not only increase your chances, but also give you more confidence and a sense of self-fullfilment, which are all great things! And I hope you truly start trying these things, and enjoy them while you do, there is no feeling better than a sense of accomplishment 

(P.s. if you decide to go to the gym, do extensive research on fitness first. Aimlessly going to the gym will actually make your life worse, (aside from giving you your daily dose of excersice) as you won't see results and it'll cause you to get unmotivated. It's important to experiment in the gym as well, along with your diet. You can speak to your parents about this and I'm sure they'll be supportive.) 

As for the actual difference itself. It's great that you can use sign language, but I have a feeling a lot of people at your school can't use that. What I would do is I'd make a really cute/cool notebook that you can carry around to write in. You can be really creative with this, have the notebook itself be something that'll catch people's attention. Keep in mind that I don't have any experience with the disabled and I don't know if this could potentially be bad advice, but I feel like a notebook like that could be an icebreaker/ conversation starter, and it could steer the conversation away from 'oh, you can't talk...?' to 'whoa that's a cool notebook'

It's clear he dosen't have an ounce of respect for her, and she deserves better."
relationship_advice,fpo1j7m,t3_gejybv,1588776693.0,"Honestly, there's no saving this. Scratch that, there's no reason *to* save this. 

side note, sometimes I listen to the most sexist men alive talking and I *relish* the fact that they'll never find women that will like them. I think it serves them right. So when I see women like you on this sub that stay with them, it makes me incredibly sad, because that's one more horrible human being out there in the world who dosen't face the repercussions of their actions and words.

Anyway, how does it feel to know that he's proud of ""breaking"" your desires? How does it feel to know that he basically owns you at this point, that he thinks you're subject to his whims at all times? How does it feel to know that he looks down on you as a person, on you as a woman, and basically looks at you like a piece of meat he lured through easy bait? How does it feel to know that he thinks you're so stupid for falling for his antics, and that he's the oh-so-amazing wife-tamer? How does it feel to be treated like a child, like you're inferior to him, like your opinions don't matter, like it's your fault that you're being treated this way? If I heard what your husband said, my anger would have already been through the roof.

 I think it comes down to self-respect at this point too. You're worth more than this. You need to remember that you're worthy of your own respect. I would never let myself stay in a relationship with someone like that, I value myself enough to. You have the right to be angry. In fact, I think you're underrreacting to all of this right now.

It's not just his words. It's not just that he brags to his friends about how he's 'broken' you. It's his actions. His two-facedness. 

He acts all nice to you in the beggining, ropes you in, and then drops the facade without a trace of guilt. In fact, he's proud of his own fakeness. He's proud that he can lie so well and that you fell for it. He's proud that he caught you in a trap. 

It's also his ignoring your desires. Him using your money for his wishes. Him not caring for you as a person. Not prioritizing you. Getting angry when you take up his time, and his space. Getting angry when you make your presence known by doing things for yourself. 

He thinks that he's got you under his thumb. He thinks that he owns you, and that now that he's got you, you can't do anything but be under his control. It's up to you to prove that wrong by standing up for yourself. You can either be the ""property"" of a man that takes pride in ignoring you and never doing what you want, or you can be free and as a bonus give him a big wake up call by leaving him."

It's okay, you can change. You can leave, and you can go to therapy. And then you'll feel your emotions, and you'll see that it wasn't all that pointless after all. I know your heart is telling you to act one way, but right now what you *need* to do is to ignore your heart and listen to your rationale.

Thank you so much. I really needed to be told that.

 I feel so guilty about this all the time. Or rather, I'm *made* to feel guilty about it. 

When my dad was depressed, my mom would berate me for not being loving enough of a daughter to save him from it. And she would force me to be all sweet and polite to him, to call him daily (she would get SO ANGRY when I didn't call him, and if something bad had happened, it would be because I didn't speak to him enough). She'd tell me that if I was just loving enough, just sweet enough, I could stop him from leaving. I tried my best, honestly, I talked to him SO much, but he quit his job and left anyway. I honestly think I'm too traumatized from that period cause I completely forgot about that until I saw what you said. And now that I'm older and reflecting back on it, I realize that there's a lot of fucked up shit she said to me back then that's caused me to feel this way.

 So, thank you, for making me remember the fact that my mom used (well, still uses) me as a literal manipulating toy to go to my father and beg and cry for him to do whatever she wants him to do."

raisedbynarcissists,fpkh6mr,t1_fpjwekj,1588694623.0,"Honestly with my mom I feel like she treats me like a toy. She'll ask me to hug her and be happy and loving and tell her to hug her whenever *she's* feeling down. In the beggining her words of love felt like real love, and I started feeling guilty for not loving her as much, but then I realized in the end she only thought of herself everytime. Her emotions hold first place over everyone else's.

When I was young, she never let me go *anywhere*, and as a result I couldn't develop many social skills and I always felt left out. As I grew older, I understood her concerns as the world is a scary place, and I felt guilty about hating her for it. But now I realize, that she was only thinking about herself, and how to quell her anxiety. It was easier for her to just shove me in a room and lock me up, because that resolved her feelings, who cares about what I think right? Never once did it cross her mind to get me a phone, or a self-defense weapon, or educate me about the world so I could go out while still being safe. The easiest method to quell her anxiety was the best method for her. 

And even with the love, fuck how I feel, let's guilt me into hugging her when the only thing I want is to be alone. 

It's like a joke, I'm loving when she wants me to be loving, I'm  monotone when she wants me to shut up, I'm stuck at home when she wants her anxiety to go away, it's like I'm not a human, just a doll that she can press to get whatever emotion/reaction she wants out of me."
raisedbynarcissists,fpkgd8p,t1_fpjuv13,1588694196.0,"Yeah I have a *really* hard time putting the label of ""abuse"" on it as well.

I'm still not entirely convinced that it's abuse, so as of right now I'm just saying that even if it wasn't abuse, I have trauma from it. 

And the ""million little paper cuts over one big papercut"" analogy makes perfect sense in this scenario, everything that I've been through wouldn't be that bad isolated by itself, but if you counted all the incidents over my sixteen years of life, that's probably hundreds, if not thousands of episodes of abuse.

I'm telling you, that at some point your girlfriend's issues will ramp up your anxiety so much that you will want to die. And you won't be happy anymore.

Also what your girlfriend is doing is abusive and controlling. I would never stay with a partner that screams at me during an argument. In fact, I hate arguing with people. I only ever engage in discussions. Arguments exist to intimidate each other, but discussions exist to bring your problems to the light and to solve them. If she has a problem with your childhood friend, you can sit down and have a civil discussion about it.

Sit down during a nuetral time, make a cup of some cocoa or some tea, and tell her that this is getting out of hand. Make a point by point list of the problems you have. Tell her that you're not okay with her screaming at you anymore. If she has a problem, she can tell it to you in a civil manner. Tell her that your friend is just a friend, and that's it. Screaming at you won't change that, and it won't make any of it go away. If she wants you to be affectionate with you, she wouldn't scream, she would initiate something. What she's doing is a form of intimidation and control, and it frankly sounds tiring. I'd rather be alone than be with a spouse like that. 

She needs help. Do you think she's just magically going to get better some day? Think for a second. Her insecurities are coming out in the form of abuse and control. This won't be the end. The insecurity will keep growing and growing, and as it grows, the abuse and control will also grow. If you don't resolve this in a satisfactory way now, it will never get better. You will be pretending that everything is fine, while sitting on a ticking time bomb. 

This is your life. This is your happiness. Don't half-ass it. Don't be with someone that makes you happy 50% of the time and anxious and depressed for the other 50%. Don't live your life like this. You can leave. And frankly, after discussing this behavior with her, if she dosen't show any remorse or acceptance, I would leave. You're worth more than this."

Of course, I don't know your parents, but I know in some cases it can be harder to go against two kids than just one. Also, do you have locks on your doors? I'd dissasociate/grey rock your family. Like your father saying he wasn't gonna make food for you? Just start making your own meals everyday. I've personally gotten to the point where I can function without my parents almost 100%, so they can't really hold anything over my head except for the fact that they give me money. 

Look into moving out as fast as you can. And try seeing if you can get your brother to move in with you as well when you do. Good luck:)"

(Just so you know, there's subs like r/ARFID and r/pickyeaters that you can check out) 
Hey, so being a picky eater can actually change your digestive system and the way you taste things. For example, it can be harder to digest certain foods if you've never had them in your life, and suddenly incorporating them or trying to eat them will lead to nausea 

For example, I suggest you look up things like ARFID or food aversion, and there's many tips on how to treat these things. 

I feel like you've built up some resentment towards your wife because of this, but when you're tackling this issue I suggest you be less resenting and more understanding about the technical reasons as to why she is that way

And since your wife grew up on a meat and potatoes diet, its gonna be hard to just get her to immediately want an eggplant parmesan. Hell, I don't want to eat an eggplant parmesan because of my upbringing as well. Not that it's your fault for making one, I'm just trying to explore what might be going through her mind. I get why she's that way. When I was younger I used to be force fed rice a lot by my mom, so now everytime I eat it I get nauseous. The only time it tastes good is with meat. I wonder if she force fed me vegetables instead of rice, if I'd get nauseous everytime I looked at vegetables. I hope you understand that it's not just a mental block, but it physically affects the body as well. I get depressed when I've had a long day and I'm hungry and then end up having to eat rice at the table. Of course, I'm grateful for it being there, and I know it's my fault I get depressed, but I can't really control what I feel y'know? I think being able to understand helps your mental health too, so you don't have to be so frustrated and angry.

I suggest you take it slow and experiment with the food. Try to be patient, but ensure that she isn't being lazy either. Be understanding, but only of the fact that she can't control her response to food, not if she ignores this as a problem even when you try to reach out to her. 

When you're confronting this issue, tell her that you're worried for her health, and that you're tired of having the same meals over and over again. And ask her if she would be open to exploring things like ARFID and experimenting with what other foods she likes other than meat and potatoes. Tell her you understand that it's hard to eat those things, so you'll be taking it step by step together. 

At first, it's gonna be hard. Personally, I am also a very picky eater, to the point where I'd rather just starve than eat a certain food. It's not because I'm just lazy, it's because I honestly feel like throwing up when eating those things. It takes a while to adjust to the taste. A couple years ago, I definetly could not eat bell peppers, or broccoli, without gagging. Now, I know how to cook them properly, and I've had them enough times to be used to the taste. I think it would help your wife if she could get used to the accounts of other picky eaters that are trying to change. Like, you can do it! Lol

As for tips on food, I think masking vegetables is a great skill to have. She probably likes burgers, right? There are so many vegetable substitutions for burgers, and there's even recipes where you can add stuff like mushroom and other vegetables into the meat and mask it so it can't be tasted

And since your wife seems to love pasta, my go-to healthy pasta recipe:

-wheat pasta (healthier than the normal kind)
-a couple tomatos (comes for one person)
-mushrooms
-brussel sprouts
-bell peppers
-zucchini.

You basically boil the tomatoes in hot water until the skin starts peeling off, then remove the skin, blend the tomatoes until it's a paste, then cook it on a stove until it's reduced to a thicker consistency, then add herbs and salt and stuff (I find this to be just as tasty as store bought marinara, but much more healthy)

then you slice the mushrooms, (into thin slices), cut the brussel sprouts in half (and put them to boil), slice the bell peppers (into thin slices, then halve the slices) , slice the zucchini as well 
(You can add any vegetable in here honestly) 
Then I put some oil on a non-stick pan, and swipe the oil around with some tissue so it coats the pan evenly. Then I put just a LITTLE bit more oil. Then I put all my vegetables in until they're a little bit charred. I think this is honestly the best way to cook vegetables for someone like me. They shouldn't be juicy or watery, they should be dry and roasted. Brings them closer to being chips. I'd gag if I had my vegetables any other way. 

Then you put your cooked pasta into the marinara you made, heat it, add a little cheese, then serve it on a plate. Add the vegetables on top. Do not mix them in with the sauce. Add more cheese to make it look unhealthy. This should probably suit your wife's tastes. If not, then I guess just have her help you cook vegetables a bunch of different ways and taste them with different things to see what's good. Or go out to healthy restaurants and sample their healthy options. (After corona I guess)

Good luck!

edit: I forgot to add, you have to stop cooking for her now, because your kids can't suffer because of this. Tell her that you'll be as supportive as you can, but when it comes to the kids you're not comfortable with changing their diets just for her. And for the people that said it's unlikely she'll change because she's 30, I mean yeah, but the only reason I know anything about picky eating is because I was listening to an almost 30 year old talk about how she's getting over her incredibly picky eating habits. Also, another suggestion I have to help is, what do you think about a garden? it would have to be your wife's though. I'd imagine no one wants to waste the vegetables they grew themselves"

A newborn baby would be as small as a dog. What will he do when the thing won't shut up? If he tries to break it's face, it's gonna die. 

Are you able to financially support yourself right now? Are you able to afford a lawyer? Do you have evidence of the fact that your husband broke the dogs leg? If not, can you have him admit it over text/ record him admitting it again?"

I cut sugar out of my life for a couple months, then when I got it back I could taste it in EVERYTHING. I used to be able to finish whole chocolate bars in one sitting, but now I have to take it in breaks because I can taste the sugar and it becomes overwhelming"
