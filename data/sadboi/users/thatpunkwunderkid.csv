offmychest,fkwgsre,t3_fkw2wu,1584592069.0,"This is so interesting to me. My boyfriend lives in England and I'm an American living in California. I got to visit him back in December and I felt exactly how you do but in reverse - the people I met with were polite and like you said, reserved, which is something I liked. I didn't encounter a single rude or angry person, though sometimes people weren't great about minding personal space (though I'm sure this issue pops up everywhere).

Meanwhile, where I live, people can be loud, rude, and inconsiderate. I've never had openly friendly neighbors like the ones you described or strangers chat me up in public. It is true that Americans get excited rather easily, and as someone who's a little sensitive to loud noise that's something that bothers me on a personal level, but I can see how it's attractive to others. Anyway, just wanted to say thanks for sharing because I don't get to see opposite perspectives like this very often. It always seems to be a case of the grass is greener on the other side with stuff like this and I enjoy reading other people's experiences. I also agree with you on the sweets - I ask my boyfriend to mail me more galaxy and cadbury all the time!"

BPD,fk92ee9,t3_fh2drc,1583967342.0,"Oh my gosh, you put it in words. I’ve had the same experience my entire life but I always chalked up the shy part of it to my GAD, never occurred to me that BPD would play a part in that but it makes sense. You’re definitely not alone."
AskReddit,fhrm0l9,t3_f4gsxv,1581830153.0,"Not sure if this really counts, but I was about 10 and changing into some pajamas in the bathroom after a shower. I had grabbed a shirt that still fit, but the neck hole was a bit small. This particular instance I struggled a little harder to get it on and once I did, the force of which I pushed my head through the neck hole propelled me forward and I smacked my face on the bathroom counter, breaking my front tooth in half diagonally.

I went to my Mom crying, and I was too embarrassed to explain exactly what had happened. I refused to go to school with a front tooth in such an ugly state so we got an emergency appointment the next day to glue it back together since the chunk was so large I could easily spot and retrieve it. About two years ago it finally fell out and now I have a mostly fake one. The shape of the broken tooth was tricky to work with, so they had to basically file the tooth down to a nub and crown it. Telling people I have a fake front tooth and having them guess which one is pretty fun at least."

AskReddit,f9z2f4w,t3_e7d1e0,1575737172.0,"My Mom drunkenly told me one night that when I was about 2 years old my parents temporarily separated to work things out. All this really entailed was Dad moving out while they went to couples therapy. Turns out during this period she cheated on him, got pregnant, and got an abortion. She never told him and begging me to do the same. They’ve been married almost 24 years and I find it hard not to be disgusted with her. She’s never spoken of it again. I really wish she’d never told me."
AskReddit,f91xwv7,t3_e380ez,1575004942.0,"I actually did try to take my life a year and a half ago. I’m incredibly grateful that I failed. 

A few months after that, I ended up telling my long distance friend how I truly felt about him after 3 years of crushing and found he felt the same. We’ve now been together a year, he came out to visit me for two weeks back in April and next month I’m taking the trip to see him in England. He also introduced me to his friends who welcomed me with open arms, and now I finally got to fulfill my dream of playing D&D for the first time, and I have an awesome group of people to play video games and nerd out with.

I also finally got a proper diagnosis and medication. I went full time at my part time job and work a fulfilling job for a wonderful small company with a boss who’s supportive and caring. I dropped out of college because I realized the major I was pursuing wasn’t going to work out as a career for me and I’m biding my time until I can pursue the one that will. I also finally reconnected with my extended family after my Mom basically divided me from them my entire life for no reason other than she was convinced they didn’t like her, and that reconnection has majorly paid off. They’re incredibly kind people and I’m glad to have them in my life. 

There are still some bad things that happened. I was in a car accident that totaled my car, both of my childhood cats passed away, and I lost the only friends I have in my state. But there were still so many good things that I’m incredibly grateful to be alive for. My life as a whole may not be perfect, but my personal growth and change is something to be proud of. After everything, I’m the happiest I’ve ever been right now. I’ve never been so happy to be alive and I can’t wait to see what happens next."

BPD,f09u1sn,t1_f08m8qc,1568506953.0,"My psychiatrist essentially told me the same thing. The first time I expressed I thought I might have BPD, she said that she had it in her notes this whole time but never put it on my charts because ""that's not something other doctors need to know."" She's still treating me for it, but the diagnosis isn't on my official records :("
offmychest,evt2dgw,t3_ckumvk,1564761351.0,"I ended up getting a lot of small flash pieces for this same reason. Ended up with about 10 of them before getting the big one to cover my scars :) Even though the initial ones were impulsive, I still love them, because it was so much better than adding to the scars (also, they still look cool as hell)."

Two of my all-time favorite series, and no one I've met has ever heard of them. I even hang out almost exclusively with other fantasy nerds! I recommend them to people every chance I get, they're such great series to get lost in for a while."
