I fear that it's also going to end me. Then i remember it's just the anxiety and OCD. I don't want this for you man, i feel really bad that you are going through it also.

For me, it gradually crept into my mind. A seed was planted by someone saying something similar to 'dont trust him he looks like a pedo' when im not. After that  the anxiety took over and gradually fucked me, then decided to uppercut me as of recently. The root of my problem was anxiety. I still get major anxiety today about it, as i have a family already.

If you can manage your anxiety, you can beat this. You masturbating to a picture is you giving in to your thoughts and trying to get it over with, its only going to make you feel worse when your anxiety hits.

 I can tell you're a good person as you feel bad about it.  I'm keeping up  my hopes, but still fear it, thus im in the same predicament, the fear and the thoughts of killing myself. But ill tell you what, im a lot better than i was.

My anxiety revolves around what other people think if me also.(if they found out) Society, friends, and family.Ive always been a good guy, never hurt, steal, lie to anyone, and I've always had the fear of people finding out about my OCD. I've told my mother about it, she accepted me with open arms, it was a huge relief. So remember the people you love and who love you will always accept you and anyone outside of that can get fucked.

Im not attracted to kids, and feel bad about the thoughts, and i see that you do too. The thought of death before you hurt someone indicates to me that you are not.

If you ever feel this feeling again come back here and let people know. Look at this thread. People care. Im not good at this encouragement thing so i hope you stay with us bro, and let time heal you just like its doing for me. If its a disorder its not going to leave, but it will get better."
