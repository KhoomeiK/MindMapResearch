I listen to too many to list but I’ll give you some of my favorites: Creature Feature (animals & biology, run by the @ProBirdRights twitter human), Last Podcast in the Left (occult, aliens, serial killers, etc by some goofy guys), Omnibus (weird things from history, by Ken Jennings & John Roderick), & the Flop House (they watch bad movies so you don’t have to). 

A lot of the ones I listen to are educational (medical history, Duolingo Spanish podcast, etc) but a lot of them are just goofy as heck (“let’s talk about movies” podcasts, Star Trek fan podcast, Welcome to Nightvale — SO good if you like weird/Lovecraftian type spooky stuff with none of the racism lol).

MensLib,fqvy69n,t3_gl3nnk,1589687890.0,"I have listened to Culture Kings & can’t recommend it enough! I haven’t listened of late, but their conversations range in topic from sports (they love talking about basketball lol) to comedy to religion to whatever’s on their minds! These guys have made me belly laugh HARD on more than one occasion. The podcast is on Apple Podcasts (apple user here) but I think you can also find it elsewhere! 

I listen to a lot of podcasts in general, so for any non-men’s-issues-themed ones by guys, I’d say check out: 

- The Flop House (bad movies, fun dudes), 

- Stuff You Should Know (random trivia, by How Stuff Works), 

- Omnibus (weird history, run by Ken Jennings & John Roderick), 

- The Greatest Generation (Star Trek TNG - as well as other Star Treks - show by goofy best friends), & 

- Friendly Fire (war movies, run by the aforementioned Star Trek guys & John Roderick). 

Again, none of these shows is specifically about men’s issues, but the guys on these shows are all pretty great IMO. 

Happy listening!
