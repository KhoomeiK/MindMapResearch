AskDocs,fqx2eg3,t1_fqx190s,1589724198.0,"I think the internet just crapped out but I‚Äôll post it when it finally loads. It wasn‚Äôt huge, so it hadn‚Äôt been there very long. I‚Äôm just extra freaked out because my GF spotted it, and I yanked it off before she stopped me. So then she got all worried that I had squeezed the bacteria out while pulling on it and should have done it with Vaseline. Anyway I think she is the most traumatized because she woke up feeling ticks about three times last night ü§Æ"

medicine,fj433zo,t3_fb36h7,1582999184.0,"Does anyone have experience with low dose quetiapine for insomnia. I‚Äôve only ever met two pts doing this, and have been curious about that."
EMTstories,fiffamw,t3_f7g2aa,1582389179.0,"Honestly private ambulance is a crapshoot. I‚Äôm talking AMR, Rural Metro, etc.. if you can get a fun gig as a ski patroller, or firefighter it would be great, but don‚Äôt sign up for private and be surprised when it sucks. 
The issue with fire is that you usually start in some sort of volunteer capacity, then move into professional firefighting over several years."
usmlestep1,fhtq00u,t3_f35nwm,1581876838.0,"Same position here. IMS life is feeling really shaky right now. I think I‚Äôm going to try to take it while I can get a numerical score, not happy about changing plans for the next 18 months though üòï"

obgyn,fhpypkd,t3_f4a41r,1581796917.0,I would take a soon appointment. With improperly positioned IUD infection and even sometimes perforation can become an issue.
obgyn,fhpxk10,t1_fhpx3dy,1581796502.0,Can you go to your uni health clinic?
obgyn,fhpx8f7,t1_fhpx3dy,1581796333.0,"That could rule the issue in, was there any significant bleeding sense you felt faint?"
obgyn,fhpx181,t1_fhpww8t,1581796231.0,Do you have a home pregnancy test you could take?
obgyn,fhpwmwt,t1_fhpwj1o,1581796067.0,"Hmm, when was your last period?"
obgyn,fhpw4f0,t3_f4ehrz,1581795865.0,"Hey, I‚Äôm really sorry to hear that, that‚Äôs a lot to go through. I‚Äôm not a doctor, but I can tell you that taking a pregnancy test could help clarify the situation. Was there any bleeding?"
medicalschoolanki,fhpuvgv,t3_f46ejy,1581795498.0,"Mine are always suspicious that I‚Äôm gonna have a breakdown and drop out, honestly it feels like that‚Äôs what they want sometimes."
medicalschoolEU,fhpe4fw,t3_efm5w8,1581787504.0,"The Italian IMAT is a rough test, I‚Äôm at Humanitas, feel free to message me."
medicalschoolEU,fhpdvvx,t3_eqzx97,1581787363.0,"Check out Italy. There are a bunch of public schools that do an IMAT admissions test in late summer. 
I‚Äôm at Humanitas, definitely recommend, and we just had one admissions test on feb 14th but there could be another call for applicants. 
Honestly I recommend taking a gap year between high school and med school. And for the love of god don‚Äôt wast your life in undergrad if you‚Äôre going straight to med school in Europe."
medicalschoolEU,fhpdek1,t3_ewc54q,1581787075.0,"I think most in Italy take transfer credits. I come from outside the EU, and transferred in about 50 credits. The big thing is having your syllabus and and slides or other material for classes gathered so you can show what was covered. Most of the time it‚Äôs done on a class by class basis and each professor decides to accept or deny credits, so kinda a role of the dice."
medicalschoolEU,fhpcwyq,t1_fgsyw7i,1581786769.0,"I second this, they can be really affordable compared to what your budget is. I‚Äôm at Humanitas and like it a lot."
medicalschoolEU,fhpcoal,t3_f0phfk,1581786602.0,"Hej hej, I‚Äôm studying first year MbbCh in Italy right now and I really like it. Several students in my class come from schools in Eastern Europe with the same complaints as you, but said that at our school it is better."
ptsd,fhpc6nq,t3_f41esk,1581786270.0,"I would just tell him what you said here:
‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to understand, I don‚Äôt want to pressure you but if you want to tell me more I am here to listen‚Äù 

When I told my boyfriend about my ptsd at the beginning of our relationship I really struggled to share things, and I almost felt like I needed the invitation to share details. 

I‚Äôd also keep in mind ptsd can be caused by more than one event, so there might not be one specific incident but rather many over time."
ptsd,fhpbman,t3_f45je6,1581785886.0,"Not too many people, mostly my very close friends, boyfriend, and a handful of people who have been told for other reasons. 
Honestly I feel like it‚Äôs not anyone‚Äôs business unless I need them to do (or stop doing) something.
For example a few years ago the boyfriend of a roommate was jumping around trying to scare me because he thought it was funny to see me startled, so I explained I have ptsd, you‚Äôre being rude bla bla. 
Other than that I don‚Äôt go out of my way to tell people, but it‚Äôs not top secret either, if someone asked id probably tell them."
ptsd,fhp9wk4,t3_f420i4,1581784878.0,"It is certainly possible to repress a painful memory of that nature. I think our bodies remember more that our brains allow into our conscious thought. If your body is telling you that something wrong happened, believe it.  
I wonder if your mom has more reason to wonder, beyond you being quite? 
Anyway I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through that, maybe it would be a good day to do something nice for yourself."
ptsd,fhp75ww,t3_etuvu8,1581783518.0,"The cycle of abuse only ends on purpose, traumatizing other people because you‚Äôve been traumatized is super not ok."
medicalschool,fhoi97z,t3_f43eb1,1581758097.0,Oh wow I‚Äôm not crying right now...certainly not crying about how med school is destroying my relationship.
Psychiatry,fhf5w0d,t1_fh8mqoz,1581536860.0,I completely second this ‚ù§Ô∏è
