Instead of looking in, wondering why they suck at life, they have to blame somebody else.

One of my favorite little anecdotes comes from the restaurant industry, where I encountered these types of people every day. We had one manager who had a college degree that took him 7 years to get at a local state school. Not a useless degree, but he said he didn’t want a big boy job because it only “contributed to the system.” Very well. 

He said he didn’t have enough money for a car and our big boss was screwing him over with bad pay. Okay. Big boss gave him a raise. Still no car, so it must be authority’s fault. 

What the manager failed to mention was that he had 3 DUIs, averaging about 12,000 dollars to take to court *each.* Oh, and he also loved to go music festivals and do a lot of hard drugs. Very expensive habits. No wonder he couldn’t get a car.
