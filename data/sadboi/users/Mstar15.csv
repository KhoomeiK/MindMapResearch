C25K,fpwr6ua,t1_fpwr2po,1588968475.0,It was an unintentional inbetweeners reference in that I completely forgot about it until you mentioned it! God I miss that programme!
C25K,fpveumk,t3_gfstty,1588943191.0,"I'm really surprised by how easy todays run felt, especially given that I very nearly decided to skip it in favour of a different type of exercise today. So happy I didnt. It also felt great, knowing I'd managed the beast that is w5d3 really helped keep me on track mentally. Then it was just a case of keeping one foot in front of the other. 

I've also finally understood what people mean when they say exercise really helps depression and anxiety. I've had both for as long as I can remember and the exercise advise never clicked. But now between c25k, ringfit adventure and dancing around my house it really has."
C25K,fpgds6i,t3_gdc1d7,1588600615.0,"This is perhaps the worst photo I've ever taken of myself but I'm thrilled I just ran for 20 minutes. I went really slowly so didn't cover much distance but I didn't stop once for 20 minutes.

After feeling rubbish for not completing it on Friday I'm proud of myself for getting back out there."
C25K,fo7xejp,t1_fo7wyyw,1587586186.0,"You definitely should, its so hard but having to take a rest day or break during a run isnt a failure. It just means you're listening to your body and setting yourself up for more successful runs in the future - you can do this! You're doing great already just by getting out there and putting 1 foot in front of the other!"
C25K,fo7wnq4,t1_fo7we9o,1587585817.0,"Maybe give yourself a rest day tomorrow, i always find i run much easier and better after a days rest! Good luck!"
C25K,fo7a0si,t3_g64tel,1587574797.0,"Really struggled to get out and do todays run after an awful day working from home, including having a panic attack. But I got out of the house and did it! I'm proud of myself for that. The run was tough but I managed - now my feelings of frustration and anxiety are further away than they were before I left the house."
mentalhealth,fms375a,t3_fx2qdr,1586345062.0,"I agree completely, i have depression and anxiety which for the most part i manage with really robust coping mechanisms. But at the moment im having to reevaluate all of those mechanisms because they're just not working - its definitely a tough situation we're all in."
lfg,floaoy5,t3_f3ie2g,1585334707.0,"Hey, my boyfriend and i are interested. We're fairly new and will be working from home for the foreseeable - is there room for the two of us?"

veganuk,ept4wkj,t3_bvwr02,1559481712.0,"I find this really odd - we had a demonstration in school (for context, this is going back at around 16 years) by Warburtons. We were shown how to make bread, I'm sure this parent wouldn't have complained about that. From what I can recall too the only mention of Warburtons was at the beginning when introducing the baker who was teaching us. I find it hard to believe that she's genuinely bothered about a ""commercially minded"" company running sessions with kids. I reckon she'd love a session from Bernard Matthews or similar. It's a shame that some people aren't confident enough to expose their children to a wide range of options and let the children choose. It's like they don't trust their own parenting..."
AskHR,epi28f8,t3_buuy9p,1559233792.0,"I’m not in HR but my place of work has tons of internal jobs. Its always been that the successful candidate is informed first, that way if for whatever reason they decline you don’t have the awkward “so you didn’t get the job before, but now we’d like to offer you the role” conversation. 

We also put an embargo on discussing it until all the candidates are informed, it is then formally announced by the hiring manager. Hope this helps!"
