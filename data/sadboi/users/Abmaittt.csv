bipolar,firn7uf,t3_f9gyd9,1582667586.0,"Lithium is completely benign for me. I’m a little more thirsty, that’s it. My job is highly mentally demanding, and I’m better on meds than I was off meds. The job requires bursts of creativity (rather than constant creativity) and they seem to come with no problem.

Having said all of that Lithium is only part of the solution for me. It is very effective at controlling my highs, but not my lows. I also needed to push through a couple of weeks of nausea before I adjusted to it. As always YMMV, but that’s my (positive) experience with it so far."

bipolar,f3tafym,t3_di3hhi,1571124975.0,I’m bipolar 1 and have a career. It can be very difficult at times and I count it God’s grace that I’ve been able to continue on. But with support and the right meds I don’t see why having a career should be deemed impossible or counted against a BP1 diagnosis.

So τῶν is functioning almost like a personal pronoun? If this is so I would translate something like ""the stewards of those in the heavens?"""
bipolar,f2geg7q,t3_dd8vo1,1570229652.0,I get it from Latuda. I now take it before bed and I find I sleep through it and don’t have any residual effect the next morning.

BipolarReddit,f26psbq,t3_dc9286,1570019884.0,"I get akathesia, though less severe than you, from Latuda. I deal with it by taking it before I go to sleep, and then I sleep through it. I do take mirtazapine which makes me sleep quite heavily so ymmv, but it might be worth a shot."
BipolarReddit,f23ntg3,t1_f23nf2a,1569932487.0,Oh that sounds like a win with the new med. I normally just have a bowl of cereal. It’s quick and easy and with the right cereal isn’t unhealthy.

BipolarReddit,f19uodd,t3_d8dnt4,1569278865.0,"I get akathisia from it so I need to take it before bed, and it can be an expensive med to take. Aside from that it helped a great deal to lift my depression. I’d say it has been worth it for me."
BipolarReddit,erz9nr0,t3_c4wdzq,1561429405.0,"I was actually diagnosed during my PhD (which was in the arts). It was bloody hard, and I wasn’t able to do my best work, but I got through it.

I had a really good support network, and was still at the point of ending my life at multiple points along the way. Having said that I hadn’t dialled in my meds yet, so if your symptoms are well controlled you might have a much easier time. Just be honest with yourself about how in check your symptoms are.

So, it is possible, but it’s hard even for someone without bipolar. Be prepared for it to be excruciating, and if it turns out easier then that is a bonus."
bipolar2,eqrbhdz,t3_bz8ydg,1560256017.0,"Since sorting out a cocktail that works for my depression, I’ve gone from always being exhausted to having energy to do what I want to do (not just need to do). Since I have a demanding job and four young children this is no small feat. I’m light years better on meds than off. There is hope."
