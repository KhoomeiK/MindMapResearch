If you mean for tweets that have already been tweeted as opposed to new tweets, then there is no way, at least that I am familiar with. An alternative could be to keep a text file of some sort that stores how many tweets you have read, and once it reaches 100 you run the program again.

aromantic,fpql6s8,t3_gdjito,1588825408.0,"Quite a philosophical question

Imo, I think it's because what they really want is a partner, not that person in specific. And their heart points towards that person as a way to achieve that. ? I'm not sure, but this is why I dont really believe in romantic relationships. They are just guessing games to find they're match.

On a side note, check out this wisdom from Plato, summarized at [this](https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/eros/platos-other-half) link. I've put a snippet of it below for your convenience:

‚ÄúNow, since their natural form had been cut in two, each one longed for its own other half, and so they would throw their arms about each other, weaving themselves together, wanting to grow together. In that condition they would die from hunger and general idleness, because they would not do anything apart from each other. Whenever one of the halves died and one was left, the one that was left still sought another and wove itself together with that. Sometimes the half he met came from a woman, as we‚Äôd call her now, sometimes it came from a man; either way, they kept on dying.""

This is the Athenian version of why people seek each other like that, so pretty cool if you ask me"

Think about it this way

There are tons of dating apps, romcoms, and just a lot of expectations in general when it comes to dating. People seem to do it constantly. 
QPRs are special. They can be anything, you set the terms. Maybe it involves sex, kissing, cuddling, maybe not. Maybe you call them your partner or boyfriend/girlfriend (or zucchini!) Maybe you live together and share finances, or maybe you live in different countries. You get the idea. QPR's are variable. If something in that relationship doesnt worm for you, simply set new terms. The most important part is that you communicate. 

For example, my closest friend knows about how I oscillate between my emotions towards her due to bpd, but she gives me space and checks up on me. QPR's work like that. 

Enhanced friendships. 

I hope this was helpful"

I say ""Well I hate it"" and hold my breath while I urinate and leave as quick as I can.

Point is, romance is the vape. In my case, I smelt it. I didn't like it. If I did, per this analogy, it would translate into me being romantically attracted, hence being attracted to the vape smell. If you were romantic, you would be the one vaping.

> As a splatling, why can't *you* get the kills? There's nothing stopping your weapon from catching the flanks. 

I should have been more specific. Flanks are a backliner issue; slayers are meant to get kills, while backliners provide support and push the objective. The ""support"" part includes looking out for flanks, which, in theory, does result in kills.

And by playing the objective, I mean that, while slayers are focused on getting kills, mid/backliners manage the task (hopping on the tower, painting the zone, painting ground for rainmaker path beforehand, etc.). This can definitely change - in fact a mark of a good backliner is to be able to quickly and effectively switch from an defensive aid to an offensive pusher.

DID,fcb0e7c,t3_egrjzp,1577580189.0,"I'm going to say something that sounds completely unrelated, but bear with me.

My favourite video game that U've ever played is Xenoblade Chronicles. Towards the end, the main characters meet and fight the God that created them. There is dialogue about how the Homs (the humans in the game) were to exist only for the God. 
As I was (and still am frankly) dealing with my own family issues at the time I first played it, I took the meaning of the game to mean that, no matter where I came from or who my parents were, I am myself. I am not them. My behaviour is not an indicator of them. Just me, since I exist. 
You, Marty, are the same. You exist. Maybe you are an alter, sure, but the truth is that you are just like Becca. You are human, you have feelings, you experience things, etc. 
You came into existence because of Becca, but you continue to exist for yourself. Because like any other person, you have a drive to thrive and survive, and do all humanly things.

asexuality,fc94ef7,t3_djuh2b,1577546853.0,YES
BPD,fc93qsh,t3_egoxe8,1577546543.0,">the idea of sex is just... Ugh. I have no libido, no drive and to be honest I don't remotely miss it.

As someone who identifies as asexual myself, I can tell that that is not a proper indicator of asexuality. I think that your decrease in libido is, as you stated, since you have someone now to help manage you. 
In short, I get it."
selfharm,fc936pe,t3_egndhi,1577546284.0,"We self harm because our brain says we need to. Our brain (hopefully) also says we need water, energy, shelter, etc. You are valid!

I had the same problem. I normally do it on my arms, but one day I thought I would try the thighs as well. I didn't like it at all, and I thought that meant that I was faking since ""a true self harmer"" would hurt themselves anywhere.

But the validity comes from me knowing that doing it there doesn't help me cope, while up there does.

Point is, we all do it in different days. The fact that you are struggling means that, no matter what they are, you and your struggles are real and valid. Please always keep this in mind.

Dissociation,fc928sm,t3_egm8h9,1577545854.0,"I'm not sure, but most likely. Zoning out is a milder form of disocciating. What you describe sounds like it is less mild than just zoning out.

>I'm often aloof, numb, day dreamy, and unfocused.

I get the sense that things don't seem/feel right. That lines up more with dissociation.

>My memory and retention is also terrible

I also have this problem. Sometimes it is due to how, in a dissociative period I am not that aware of my surroundings. My ears pick things up and my brain comprehends it, but it's like it is shoved away in some dark corner in my head and I can't find it when I come out of it.

>Sometimes I will stare off into space for over a minute.

This is where I get unsure. When I dissociate, I can only guess at how long it's been. I can't remember the time where it started or the time it ended, I just become aware. It's almost like I say to myself, ""Oh? I'm awake"" even though I was awake, just not there because I was dissociating.

I don't know what's going on in your life, but I have learned that dissociating is a coping mechanism in response (usually) to trauma. Sometimes your brain just tries to hide stuff or memories from you to protect you. Try looking into reasons why this might be happening.

Dissociation,fbr41ro,t3_ee2zpr,1577038899.0,"What you've described sounds more like Derealization. Derealization is when the world starts to look unclear, and can happen in a variety of different ways. Derealization and Depersonalization often come with Dissociation, so I think you should look into it further."
javahelp,fb3gx6d,t3_eb1h4n,1576472788.0,"I'm in my last year of high school right now taking AP computer science. As far as basics go, the best advice I can give you is to branch out:
Maybe this means thinking of a basic new project and trying to implement it (a simple one could be a MadLib, which helps learning how to read files). Then try and improve it; look online and see and try others' solutions of how they did it.
I also recommend going to CodingBat.com. That website has great little problem sets that help build a specific area (Strings, Arrays, Recursion, etc).
Hope that helps."
