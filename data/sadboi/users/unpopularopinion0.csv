&#x200B;

I am the same way. I am a hermit. The only way I play with others and enjoy it is if I've known them for years and years and even then I still dont' enjoy the time i spend with them usually.

&#x200B;

I am not a hopeful comment. Music is hard and so is the making music with others part. Learn to make it with yourself and invite people to participate. If they don't like the music you'll know second hand by getting no replies or aloofness. If people like your music you will constantly hear from them and get invites to jam all the time.

&#x200B;

If you ever meet someone who has the same vibe as you, prepare something as if you mean it. Make a session that screams ""i fucking prepared this session and it's going smooth as fuck."" Then invite them to jam as if it's nothing. No biggie. But if they accept and come, you'll be ready. If they deny you, just ask them again next week. If they deny you again, ask again. If they flake... fuck it. Their loss? I dunno."
