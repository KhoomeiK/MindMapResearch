BPD,favnpql,t1_favmh7z,1576360530.0,"wow! I am honestly blown away by your response because I think thats a really good idea and I hadn't thought about asking her that before, thankyou for your insight its been so helpful. when I've asked her before why she's refusing help she has replied with wanting to die, or just simply because she can't do it, but I will certainly try this approach, thankyou once again!"
BPD,favn7ux,t3_eam1of,1576360371.0,"I've done similar before! broke up with my boyfriend of a year because my ""friend"" messaged me saying he liked me. this may sound awful but I like the empowerment. I like that I can control this aspect of my life and finally I can hurt people like I've been hurt"

helpme,faujmm4,t3_ean3l5,1576348671.0,"please contact the police! your mother may have hurt you, but it seems like she needs help, and I think that you may need to get some higher authorities involved in the situation."
BPD,fantijl,t3_ea4xdv,1576250236.0,"before I was hospitalised I had attempted suicide multiple times, and it was at that point that I realised I needed help. I did not want it, and had accepted I was still going to die, but I would still go to hospital-like a last resort. I attempted suicide and ended up in A & E on the Wednesday night, had the crisis team come and see me on the Thursday morning- they asked me about it and I stated that if I was released I would obviously try again. Thursday afternoon I had an emergency appointment with my psychiatrist, and I in fact suggested a hospital- which she thought would be a good idea. Friday morning I was admitted and I was absolutely terrified. If you're contemplating doing it, just go for it- you know when you're ready to get help. Finals are important yes, but your wellbeing is way more important. Do what is best for you."
mentalhealth,fans5nx,t3_ea4bn4,1576249305.0,if you are feeling this way often then it is important that you talk to someone in order to try and get support

helpme,fanrloa,t3_e9zfxl,1576248920.0,"I don't think that its as easy as just losing it, but there are certainly steps you can overcome to make it easier to deal with"
Anxiety,fanpk60,t3_ea42n0,1576247446.0,For me this happens when I'm feeling overwhelmed and already upset or stressed about something.
BPD,fanpdvn,t3_ea16wc,1576247315.0,"For me, blaming myself has always been some sort of coping mechanism, I guess I would call it that anyway. Remember that borderlines have a tendency to blame themselves for things that aren't their fault and so you are not alone in what you are feeling. But you are not a monster! Just take each day as it comes, and try to remember that your feelings are valid but you are not a monster."
BPD,fakooxl,t3_e9oayz,1576170618.0,"This fear is completely valid! When I first got my diagnosis, my parents would never take me seriously, and to this day they can often be insensitive to my feelings or my diagnosis. Remember that he is your father and whatever happens he will still love you, I think doing some research about your diagnosis would be extremely helpful, not just for when talking to your dad but it may be soothing for you too. Sit down with your father in an environment in which you feel comfortable. Id suggest proposing the  idea to him as some sort of learning experience for you both together. There is no way for you to know how he will react, but even if he doesn't react well, he is still your dad and he still loves you! Sometimes people find it hard to empathise with people with mental health issues as they have never been in that situation themselves, and thats completely okay, but I do think it would be good for you to at least try! and good luck!"
BPD,fakmq0a,t1_fak3tb4,1576169690.0,"I understand where you're coming from honestly, unfortunately its common amongst the majority of people to not realise until its too late. The problem is, people need help now- but as I said, people don't realise how much people need help until they are already gone, at which point people will regret their actions during said persons life."
BPD,fajlz6c,t3_e9j3o4,1576144654.0,"I used to do this a lot! When my friend died in January, I saw just how people react to a suicide. A lot more people care then we assume would care, every person that we come into contact to within our life forms some sort of emotional attachment to us, and whether we realise it or not- we have more impact on people then we realise."
BPD,fajljt2,t3_e9k64o,1576144009.0,"Good luck! When I started group DBT I was terrified, but honestly it was one of the key factors of my recovery-  some of the skills may not work for you and that is okay, but eventually you will find something that works. I understand why you are weary of going, but its worth it! And don't be scared, remember that everyone else is in the same situation as you! And as for the DBT programme, my therapist once told me that the woman who developed the programme had was borderline too, and that helped me a great deal."
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fajl5iq,t3_e9gfg9,1576143409.0,"You've got this! Im proud of you, you're going through so much and you're still going, thats amazing to hear! When I'm feeling down I like to think that you need to have the rain to have the rainbow. And you're going to get your rainbow, I believe in you."
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fajkywb,t1_fac3pie,1576143129.0,agreed! I don't think anyone truly gets what someone is going through unless they have been in that situation too!
