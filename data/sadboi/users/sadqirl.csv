Idea living situation would be a nice modern apartment with a balcony .. not necessarily big though. that would be a dream"
Switch,fperbds,t1_fpe0dui,1588553278.0,"Well I brought a switch lite about a week after posting this and I’ve had no problems with it so far , it’s been about 3 weeks ish. No drift yet and it’s been a great console. I’m thinking if it does end up drifting I’ll just buy a considerably cheap controller to connect to it and I’ll be good to go.. I just thought fuck it and took the risk. No regrets so far. It’s been a great consol, And if it does fuck up I have a solution without having to pay £80 odd every month for a new joycon because they are overpriced asf especially as they can be faulty. 
I think buying a controller is a better and cheaper solution if u have a dodgy joycon"

depression,fosbznq,t3_g9a9h6,1588027749.0,"This is exactly why I cannot live with anyone . It would drive me crazy with all the judgement when I’m depressed, sometimes months at a time I will be in the same routine mostly being in bed not wanting to talk and most ‘normal’ ‘mentally healthy’ people don’t understand it for shit. And make me feel worse. So fuck living with anyone unless they have depression themselves tbh and you’ve both agreed that if one doesn’t want to leave their dam bed and not talk then the other is okay with that"

depression,fnsx39i,t3_g3ps60,1587230446.0,I’m on the same boat as u .. fuck society and fuck the system. ‘Oh you have to make a contribution to society’  WHY?? For who?? Ain’t nobody has done shit for me in society except obviously people in my life . Other than that why the fuck should I be a sad working slave for the rest of my life for the fucking government who only cares about taking our money to kill innocent people in war and make nuclear bombs? Your gonna kill us anyway so don’t fucking expect me to work for your privileged asses.
depression,fnslujf,t3_g3p90k,1587224270.0,"I know how ur feeling I have depression and anxiety and the best thing u can do for yourself is ignore all the news. As long as u know how to keep you self safe that’s all that u need to know , don’t read any bad news , or watch bad news. Don’t take it in because it’s just negative vibes and some of it is fake news just to scare you. Just scroll past it and watch something funny on YouTube or whatever . And as for that guy ! DO NOT send him nudes ever again, even if he begs just ignore him. There are better guys out there u can talk to who will listen and care about you and not ur body. I hate guys who will beg for nudes off girls but their not truly your friend/they don’t give a fuck and share to their mates.  This may not have happened to u but just don’t bother with the scumbag. That’s a whole other thing I could get into tho lol"

I recently fell out with all of them.

I make my own decisions and live life on my terms ... friends come with to much drama and shit anyway .."
depression,fn6mqcd,t3_fzxoij,1586702996.0,"I’m past the point of insanity, I’ve had this exact thought process and I’ve had multiple mental health crazy breakdown episodes due to it. I think I’ve just come to point now where I’m saying ‘ it is what it is ‘ because we can’t control anything , and I’ve read in a book before ‘don’t stress over what u can’t control’ just let it go and enjoy what u can. Do what the fuck u want because everyone is a dickhead.. and that’s how the earth it . Should stop u from enjoying ur life on your terms. Fuck everything ... that’s the best advice I can give heh.

Start reading books about life and happiness, 
‘The subtle art of not giving a fuck’ is a really good book for u I’d say, u can find it online for free if ur interested"

unpopularopinion,fn00rl2,t3_fyeeay,1586533326.0,"This is the first time I’ve seen someone acknowledge this! 
I’m a girl and I was bullied throughout my school life by both boys and girls and let me tell u now the girls did a wholeeee lot more damage to me than the boys.

With the boys it was always just picking on me here and there and that sucked but it was nothing, they didn’t really care, I’d always get over it. 

BUT with the girls it wasn’t just picking on me it was so much deeper than that, girls have evil intentions, they will literally do anything to put your self esteem down because for some reason that’s a hobby for most of them, evil stares bitchiness showing u up in front of the class rumours I could go on ..if a girl doesn’t like u they just treat you like your scum. Even worse when a whole group are at it. And they are so childish and inconsiderate in situations that would be fixed with a conversation. As a girl , girls literally drive me up the wall. I cannot stand them. It’s been detrimental to my mental health. 

It’s caused me to be somewhat scared of any girl that walks my way now, and I’m a girl myself !
All the people I talk to are boys , all my friends are boys. I just get on better with boys and I feel 100x more comfortable around boys because I know they don’t care about being petty/jealous/bitchy/fake/hating. 

Oh I am 19 btw and have left school early thank fuck..I’m just talking from experience also"
