It took a good while to find a good combo/dosage of meds. For example, when I was on Depakote, I felt EXACTLY what you’re feeling. 

Once I finally found the right combo though... I am myself. I’m a little quirky, a lot loud, opinionated, snarky, sassy... but reasonably so. 

There is nothing wrong with the traits I’ve listed about myself. What WAS wrong, was those traits being toxic, overbearing, and straight up volatile for myself and those around me.

Sincere thanks for not tearing me a new one on that!"
nova,fl6vr83,t1_fl6tz1h,1584884843.0,Our president consistently making irresponsible and inaccurate statements that are in direct contradiction to fckn MEDICAL EXPERTS certainly doesn’t help either.
aww,fl6sqj5,t1_fl5lf1f,1584882181.0,"Yes but you’ve just reiterated the point both myself & u/bikes-n-math made. You also contradicted yourself, saying terminology doesn’t matter but then ending with calling it a DIGITAL painting.

Neither of us were disparaging in terms of calling it art. It is. But it is digital painting, not painting."
nova,fl6rssn,t1_fl6luqi,1584881304.0,"I find it to be maddening. Self isolation is kind of inconvenient and I’m certainly having to find new ways to fill my time but I can’t believe people somehow find the alternative to be a better option. 

Possibly a combination of entitlement and “that won’t happen to me”...? Not a risk I’m willing to take and idgaf if people define that as ‘paranoia.’ I’ll stick to my house, thanks. 

Stay safe, stay smart ✌🏻"
