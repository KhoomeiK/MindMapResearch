blackmagic,esxpbsp,t1_esxf52y,1562333540.0,So what exactly did you do when you got it to work? I want him back. I just want him back. Idgaf how annoying he gets.... I lost my best friend and for what... I didnt even get an explanation. I just want him to come home.
SuicideWatch,esx8leo,t3_c34ko8,1562326994.0,"Reminded me of me too... I've been thinking about killing myself ever since he broke up with me over a month ago.... I feel like I lost my best friend
...
It really sucks. I hope it gets easier, this isnt the 1st breakup... and it's not even the worse.  My last bf was killed in front of me... 
But there was something about this one. But idk what, charm maybe... because he took everything from me and deserted me. And now that I think about killing myself over someone who does not even care if I open my eyes tomorrow... I feel like there is something wrong with me. He would definitely use my death to his advantage and let people pity him as he blamed himself and fake cried. 

Sorry. This has nothing to do with you or your story... it just made me think. 
You are nothing like my ex from what I gather either.
You didnt give up on her. 

Sorry you had to go through that.
And sorry to vent on your post.
Wasnt trying to make it about me.... just kinda got started and couldnt stop. Love you."
