aion,evuftd2,t1_evsh3qz,1564794054.0,"Hey there! Thanks for reaching out. I’m Asmodian in the Katalam server. I have a couple of lowbie toons that could partner up with you if you’re Asmodian and on the KT server. I’m willing to help out as much as I can, but just know I’m still trying to figure out the game myself. My current main in game is my spirit master Elihnia. 
I’m slowly not playing much anymore as I’m getting busier. But I still play time to time. The best advice I can give you right now is look up as much videos as you can on the game. There’s a lot out there and they helped me so much!"
Anxiety,euyvms0,t3_chv17b,1564109084.0,"I wanted to share to this same thing! You’re amazing, you’re loved and you are wonderful! Thank you for sharing this because it’s very needed. 

Have a great one!"
Anxiety,euwhz08,t1_euwam3x,1564075447.0,"I’ll definitely challenge myself to care less because I need it for my own sanity. As I get older it’s getting a bit easier. The thing I need to overcome is the need for validation and conformation. I always feel that if I’m going against the grain I’m wrong. And I hate being wrong. I need to think I have a different perspective that needs to be shared because with differing perspectives means diversity. It’s taking me time to realize this. I’m pushing myself by actually posting on Reddit and I’m proud of myself for doing that. Different views brings stronger connections.

I’ve joined that subreddit for future reference!"
Anxiety,euw58t5,t3_chl6gx,1564070615.0,"I feel the exact same way. And it pours over in real life where I worry about what to say and how to say it. It just ends up making me silent and unable to really express how I feel. I wish I had the courage not to care. It’s a struggle even posting this comment but I’m going to make that step. 

Thank you for posting because it helps to know I’m not the only one."
aion,euc6q9n,t1_eu7fhtb,1563666589.0,"I am still looking for a legion. I’d love to get into Probably Drunk. I see them running around and I noticed you need to be referred in order to get in. So that would be great if that could be arranged! 

I’m finally 80 on my SM and struggling to build gear. (Mirage is so hard for me. I die constantly from the boss I know the mechanics but the minor spell she does hits hard and I can’t summon my pet) I’m thinking of just starting a new character and trying to find one that I really like and people will want me along for group instances. Maybe go Glad? But then again I know the painter class is coming and maybe I should wait for playing a new char till then. Dunno. 

Thanks for helping me out I really appreciate it."
aion,eu5xuj7,t1_eu4roji,1563487845.0,"Thank you so much for the support! I’m a Asmodian on the Katalem server. I realize that’s a lower populated server for Asmodians which I didn’t know when I created characters for that server. Had I known I would have gone to the other server and/or go Eylos. But such is life. I’m just working with what I got. There’s not a lot of legions to choose from on this server unfortunately. And most want pvp “smart” players, “special” players or are in a different language all together. So I’m sorta screwed. 

I’m actually looking forward to this new patch. Hopefully, like you said, it will help bring in more people to the game. 

I guess I’ll give in and check out Discord—once I get into a legion. 

Thanks again! I’m currently working on my SM which I think might go main since I’m really liking how it feels better then chanter.  I know... not a popular class to stick with. But I find it fun. ^^;"
aion,eu5vpk4,t1_eu5guoc,1563486423.0,"I’m ashamed to admit that I couldn’t find the portal to COE lol...(I found it since then—so embarrassing...I’m dumb what can I say) and I finally got someone to do it with me after knowing where to enter. The people who I previously mentioned in my first post ( who helped me out a lot ) were going to show me everything without question but I had to leave when they were going to guide me through it. I’ve been on two runs of COE since last posting.  Yay! Finally.

When I reach out to players—either through the guild or publicly—I’ll whisper or guild chat. And rarely will I talk openly in the middle of Lakrum. But to no avail. I realize that a lot of text fills the chat log so it’s easy to miss what I say to people. I’ve since given up on the legion I’m in and now I’m looking for a new one. Except I’m now working on my SM who’s 78 and most  legions won’t accept players until 80.  I’m trying to get to 80 but pvpers are killing me while I’m trying to complete quests which is slowing me down considerably.

That’s about it in terms of how I go about business in Aion. 

Thanks for the comment!"
aion,eu41eoo,t1_eu3u7ar,1563433726.0,"I really appreciate that! It’s sad that it has come to this... it’s not only sad that’s it’s p2w but in a way its p2 have friends. If you’re not seasoned you’re ignored and treated with contempt. I wish I had another game to turn to but I put so much time and effort into trying to figure out this game that getting into a new game seems daunting. 

Thank you so much for the comment!"
