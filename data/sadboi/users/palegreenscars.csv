Waiting_To_Wed,fqpkpg0,t3_gjwshs,1589548658.0,"I am not in the same position, but I do feel that marriage discussion has set back my relationship. My BF and I have been together for 4.5 years. When we met and began dating we both said we were looking to get married and have kids. We broke up a few days shy of being together for a year because he wasn’t sure if he still wanted the same things. We got back together a few weeks later. 

New Year’s 2017 I asked what our goals for our relationship were for 2018. He said to get engaged. 2018 went along fine. I thought he would propose on a big vacation we took in September. He didn’t, which prompted me to ask what was going on. He said he was no longer sure he wanted to get married. I was devastated. We’ve stayed together, but now I don’t know what he wants and what our future looks like. I know I want to be with him, but I also want to get married. 

We haven’t talked much about what prompted him to change his mind or what happens now. When I do ask, he says he does want to get married but doesn’t want to be “pressured.”

I share my story because for me, what I want has had to adapt to what he wants when it turned out that we may not want the same things. My advice to you is to think about what you want for yourself going forward, and then decide if he can be a part of it. I think it can be okay that your relationship isn’t what it once was, relationships should be dynamic, but is what it is now something that makes you happy? Can your current relationship make you happy in a different way than it did before?

Good luck to you."

It has been an up and down week emotionally. Last week was four years since my mom (unexpectedly) passed so that’s been on my mind. I’ve had a rough time getting out of the consequential mental funk. 

But, last week I made one of my twin nieces smile for the first time (3.5 months old) and this week I made the other one smile, so I’m riding high from that. Oh my gosh you guys, I wish I could express how much I adore these little girls. I have always loved kids (have spent ten years working with young ones) and babies always make me happy, but having nieces? I’m infatuated. I could stare at them for days. 

QOTD: there’s a restaurant I went to probably two decades ago. It’s called the Rowe Inn and it’s in the middle of nowhere northern Michigan. My dad and I ate there when we were on vacation per his boss’ recommendation. We had this goat cheese and tomato baked appetizer and it was absolutely divine. You got this creamy richness from the cheese with a bit of acid from tomato, plus a crunchy hunk of bread dipped in. So. Good."
