PersonalFinanceCanada,fnaips4,t3_fv1u49,1586798200.0,I have EI open from the summer. Had contracts since September so didn't need most of it. I still have many weeks left on my claim. I was off due to  sick leave in March and the person who I was covering on maternity came back. My last day (although on paid sick leave ) was on April 5. Do I qualify for EI or cerb? I would have to reactivate my last EI but ask for sickness benefits. I can't get a hold of service Canada. Should I apply for cerb?

And the panic was unnecessary and just to wash hands, don't come in if you're sick, etc. . I have family members in their 90s... And the symptoms  of this disease are dormant for up to 2 weeks. Being in grappling distance is just plain stupid. Only staying off the mat when you feel sick does not work for the spread of this disease. Stephen Kestling post was right on... I plan on supporting my gym but after that post it makes me question a lot about the owners priorities...."

I see both sides but I just feel like I'm being tossed between doctors who see me for 5 mins and then change everything on me because they don't agree with the previous doctor.

And worry about not having the proper treatment (medicine, counselling, etc.) I just feel so .... Uncertain about everything including my diagnosis(s)... I'm seeing a psychologist who doesn't care about the diagnosis or labels but really wants to work on inner voice therapy, but she's so booked up that I can only see her every other week.

 Unfortunately my job is in government and so hr covers most things and bosses change every few months as my job location and assignments change.   My role is learning something new every few months so it's like once I get into a groove... Time to do it all over again. It consumes my time at home just to survive during the day.  Union is also very adiment of not disclosing diagnoses. 

 I'm covering someone else's stress leave so it's also hard because it's like I'm causing a lot more work for my bosses. I  just want to get permanent so there's some consistency. But then I think.... They're not going to want to hire someone who has accommodations or is off sick. I know technically they can't discriminate but it happens.

I didn't make the connection that both lives are just as important. Both are sentient and have been shown to have unique personalities (even fish have shown they have different personalities... A good friend of mine is a fisheries biologist and has seen these studies). Unfortunately animal agriculture also displaces many of these ""cuter""  animals  (e.g. cats, wolves, koalas)   due to deforestation.   Animal agriculture is also a large component of climate change that may contribute to these awful forest fires.  I think people can be pet lovers, or like certain animals.  But to be an animal lover, I don't think you can harm them. Cows and pigs and chickens are actually very smart and playful. Our society (especially in the western world( is very quick to judge eastern countries in Asia that raise dogs for meat, but what's really the difference between a dog and a cow? They are both sentiment beings and have feelings. They want to live."

For this one serving (which was a lot for one) I used: 

 2 cups mushroom broth (I used Campbells),
 75 grams ""lacey"" buckwheat noodles,
 75 grams enoki mushrooms, 
2 green onions, 
a very very small pinch of chili flakes (to taste) and a splash of aminos or soy sauce (to taste). 

I just got the broth to a boil, 
added the noodles, 
Frequently stirred noodles with tongs 
Added mushrooms once the noodles started to tender up,
 sprinkled in some cut up green onion, 
a splash of aminos (or soy) , and then the chili.

Let cool a bit as it will be very hot!
 Maybe took 15 mins in total from start to finish (didn't time)

Disclaimer: the lacey noodles (I bought at an Asian supermarket) are so thick,  my husband was impatient and  didn't want to wait for it to cook, dropped a noodle, and they're so big he burnt himself with the broth ."

I know right now would be an awful time for me to have a child., But I want a family and I know my biological clock is ticking.

BPD,etf3fgi,t1_etejyj4,1562758719.0,"I've been told I'm good at my job as well. I can be given very positive feedback and then I continue to seek validation / feedback . I liken in to feeling like I'm a new , fresh employee. However I've been in my field for 6 years. I'm always paranoid they're going to find out I'm not actually good at my job and ""find me out"". It takes up way too much energy. 

That's really unfortunate she won't get help. I don't blame you for leaving. I don't think you can be a support to anyone if it's also causing you mental health problems. You deserve to be happy too. If she's not willing to get help it's also not a good sign. I don't think things will get better so huge kudos for you. I can only imagine how hard it is looking in. 

One of the reasons I'm getting help is because I don't want to push my husband away. It takes a huge emotional toll on him. He doesn't deserve that. On a selfish note it REALLY sucks having overwhelming thoughts that I  can't escape. I'm tired and exhausted of feeling this way. 

I used to think it was all internal. I have been told that I do get angry and it would turn into blind rage. I always thought it was internel. This never happens at work. I don't know why, and I completely trust myself not to do it at work. I think it's a comfort and safety thing. I only do it around loved ones...the people I shouldn't be angry against. Not okay but so far I've had some improvements. 

I've never been physical outwards to others. But I have been told that I  have gotten in shouting matches and temper tantrum mode. Lots of crying and anger at myself ... But directed at him. Not okay , and looking back it makes me hate myself more. 

 He's been an amazing support. There are times when I need to snap out of it, and he didn't know how to help. Eg. Touching me does not help. It makes me get into a deeper panic. Therapy has given me some tools to get out of that state. It's hard for me to get off the rollercoaster and access these tools so I have had to lean on him for support to help me access them (e.g. grab Ice for me). 

It sounds like you were/are an amazing support for your ex. In my opinion the fact that she isn't ready to get help is a huge sign that you did the right thing. To ""show up"" to therapy and show up for therapy are very different things. Sometimes counsellors don't click and it's hard to share and be vulnerable... But if that's the case , then the effort needs to be made on her end to find someone else. It sounds like you did all that you can do.

 I'm sorry you're going through this. I know it takes a toll on my husband. I can't imagine what it's like to see someone you care about struggling and not seeking help. Definitely take care of yourself and seek help for yourself if you're depressed. I wish you all the best and happiness."
BPD,etedeqn,t3_cbabj7,1562729471.0,"I'm newly diagnosed... And I've been trying to do a lot of reflecting on past behaviours and figure out what splitting is. My husband has assured me that there are times when I'm all lovey dovey towards him, but then I turn on a dime. For instance he'll do some chores around the house, and then then he'll make a ""mistake"" (usually something I haven't communicated with him) and then I get paranoid that it was deliberate and he doesn't care about me or want to be with me. It would end with me sobbing on the floor in a mess. The other good things he has done I forget. I'm very much black and White at thinking. I'll be so grateful and lovey towards the good stuff... Then one little thing is ""wrong"" and he's the worst person ever. I also can be good at hiding the bpd.. I think they call this ""high functioning"" . For me specifically this happens at  work.  I do a lot of the black and white thinking... I  internalize it and cry in the bathroom or bottle it up and cry at home. This is  based on what I think others are thinking of me ... It's very tiring!  Especially when there's no basis for me having those negative thoughts.

BPD,etbh735,t1_etaijcg,1562646770.0,"Hi Anon. Thanks for replying!  I highly respect any first responders and very unfortunate that their budgets are so tight.  kudos to your friends for providing a key service to their communities. 

I'm dabbling with the opportunity of volunteer fire fighting. This way I can still teach to pay the bills, and see if it's something I want to do for a career. I don't see too many firefighters with burnout here in Ontario. I do Brazilian Jiu Jitsu with some firefighters, and my dad is friends with some. I know it would be very hardwork and they have very difficult scenes to respond to. I am the type who really needs to feel like what I'm doing is rewarding. I definitely think first response would tick that box.  I believe in Canada they usually work 2, 24 hour shifts in a week and they seem to have really good life balance.

In regards to teaching,  I actually really enjoy special education and when im in the right headspace I'm good at my job. I have just really dreaded it lately. I'm not sure if it's the job itself or how my mind plays tricks on me (e.g. taking it way too seriously and not taking time for breaks when i'm prepping or contacting parents). Im always seeking validation (unnecessarily) from co-workers or administration. If I'm not getting any good feedback I feel like I'm doing something wrong. I always feel like others think I'm doing a horrible job. I have difficulty with clocking out because there's always something that can be done.  I once ignored my husband (unknowingly) on his birthday because I was so wrapped up in making a perfect lesson for the next week. It was like I was in a trance. 

My husband thinks I should stick with teaching. He thinks all these problems will just appear at whatever other career I choose. I can see that as a possibility.. but I do see more opportunities for self care (time off) in some professions. I also don't want to be unknowingly neglecting my loved ones. Having a job that doesn't require me to bring work home every night would be nice  I still feel crappy for how his birthday turned out. I still don't know if teaching is a a good fit... but I've been working towards it for 6 years."
BPD,etaarlk,t3_cam1xv,1562616047.0,"I'm an occasional teacher. I hate it. I sometimes get long term occasional jobs (more than 2 weeks) and I get overwhelmed with the change. I overthink everything and I'm terrified of breaking down in class. This would be career ending. I've lost some teaching contract jobs because of my bpd and my inability to commit to a job ,(i.e. give up my contract,  not being fired) Also the career outlook in Ontario isnt doing too well.

I'm currently looking at firefighting..  something that works in time for fitness and self care. I love helping others. However, my husband thinks this is a bad idea ... Idk what I want to do and I'm 29..."
BPD,et9hfbp,t3_cae7sy,1562596980.0,"Wow I can completely relate. Although I usually dread the activity immediately after accepting. It has cost me jobs because I get so sick that I can't go through with it . And then looking back I could... And then I have major regret and wish something bad would happen to me so I didn't have to go through the pain.

Update: im also somewhat newly diagnosed as it was this past April."
