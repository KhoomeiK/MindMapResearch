BPD,fr33qa6,t3_gm7ym3,1589849329.0,"I’ve done some research on this for a project in school (I also have BPD) and would recommend looking into the concept of “narrative identity”. Studies seem to show that those of us with BPD have a harder time forming a narrative identity, i.e. we have a hard time feeling like our lives have a continual narrative which we are the protagonists of, without this sort of grounding many of us end up feeling like we’re just kinda ‘there’ rather than living a story, so to speak."

I have been certain that I will kill myself, I have made plans and been ready to follow through with them. The only thing that has ever worked to change my mind is to imagine all the possibilities I could miss out on. I know it feels so hopeless, but there is an endless amount of possibility out there. Look up at the sun, feel it on your face, recognize that you are just a brain in a body and this is your one shot at experiencing things. We will all die in the end; why not stay around a little bit longer just to see what happens? There is a timeline in which you end up happy and glad to be alive, but if you end your life that possibility disappears. I swear, even if it seems impossible, there is a possibility of finding happiness in this life, I promise. I have been there and I am living proof that you can get through this.
