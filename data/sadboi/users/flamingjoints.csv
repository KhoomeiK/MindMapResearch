unpopularopinion,fjrk8xj,t3_fek2il,1583586484.0,"Unnecessary oversharing that nobody's going to care about anyway, but whatever. When I found myself seeking out public assistance in various forms at as early an age as I did, I really felt like I had hit my lowest.     
    
Got away from my abusive family, withdrew medically from college without graduating to become homeless and hop through the system to get shelter and services I needed. I was never as close to ending my life as I was when I was first hopping through those shitty cigarette stained motels, getting on busses and seeing people on their way to work while I'm on my way to get handouts.   
  
I didn't mind the drug tests, the trips to department of social services which were daily in the beginning, but what really made me feel the worst was the bus drivers, oddly enough. They all knew exactly what you were doing when you get on here and get off there, and some of them made sure to express just how much disdain they had towards people who sought out these services.     
      
Yeah, I've been dealing with debilitating health issues for years now, yes I did get away from an abusive home life, but I still second guessed it due to how manipulative my mother and how much she fucked up my perception of reality. The public perception of it didn't help either.        
    
Having that voice of my narcissistic manipulative abuser in my ear and in my head for year following my escape from that hellhole of a drug house really made me feel like I was nothing more than a drain on the system.     
     
I know now that shit isn't as simple as that. I was shocked to learn that the number of people who receive benefits in this area was much higher than I had initially anticipated.       
    
I worked a job up until I couldn't anymore, continued going to college despite these health issues actively getting worse, and opened and tried to run a business well after I couldn't manage to even shower on a daily basis,       
    
    
I also know that I am young, haven't been on assistance very long, and that if I do get some traction on these health issues which have been out of control for nearly a decade that I might be able to put money back into this system. That's assuming I can manage to stick around long enough to make that happen without blowing my brains out from this pain or going overseas to Switzerland to get it done legally.     
   
It's a fucked up worldview, but it costs roughly 13k to get that done, which is a lot cheaper than what it costs to keep me going in this situation, and for a long time I saw one as a lot better of an option for society.       
    
Still, for all intents and purposes, I am a drain on the system.     
    
I keep looking forward to a day when I can talk about this all past tense, and reflect on it without feeling the shame that I feel when I think about just how much of your tax dollars I'm currently taking just to stay alive while being useless to society."

unpopularopinion,fi73f3w,t3_f6otme,1582213475.0,"Randomly had a post blow up on /r/povertyfinance where I mentioned I was eating oats and water for almost a month because of health issues/getting away from my abusive family which left me crippled, homeless, and broke. The picture was just a container of Chinese food which someone had kindly bought me.      
    
At the time I was literally stuck in my dorm room, pissing in jugs, soon to be evicted as I had medically withdrawn from college due to my illness getting so bad. I was putting instant oats in tap water, mixing and waiting half hour before eating it cold, and rationing my sugar packets I had stolen from the dining hall. Going from a month straight of that to a proper meal was a big deal to me.         
       
Once it hit /r/all, a ton of people started calling into question the validity of my claims, and picking apart my post history. Arguments included:   
   
1.) The picture posted was high resolution, and homeless people don't have smartphones. My Galaxy S5 which was reported stolen by my family after I got away from them takes high resolution pictures, so I guess that discounts everything else I was dealing with.     
   
2.) I post about using CBD, which as you know costs money. 
  
3.) I posted pictures of vaporizers, which again cost money.    
   
At the time I was hustling homemade DIY vape liquid and ecig devices to college students to make some money while being so crippled and useless, since it's very cheap to mix liquid in bulk if you know what you're doing. I also was just getting into selling CBD, which at the time was another hustle, but now is a fully incorporated company which I've been running over for a year.   
   
I had people defending me, but far more were shitting on me and calling me a liar.    
  
I've gotten so much support from random strangers in this website over the years, and some of the kind things I've had provided to me during my darkest times still bring me to tears when I think of them.                 
        
From people on abuse support subs validating my experience and telling me what I was going through was in fact abuse, to people on chronic pain subs making me feel a bit less crazy and letting me vent, I've had so much support over the years from this website. Even just being in those situations and having a notification to respond to made me feel better most of the time."

Sure, some legal states allow you to get access to lab tested carts which means you know what's inside (unlike the indistinguishable black market carts people fill with God knows what), but the materials that makeup the cart interior are very sketchy in my opinion, and I've been around vaporizers of all types for a long time now.
