And then I asked her why she looked so happy now
She said ""I finally like myself, at last I like myself""

It’s a really sweet and emotionally resonant moment, and if you listen to “Taxi”(Sequel’s mother song) and Sequel back to back it’s a really sweet story.

Thick as a brick is the name of the song, and the name of the album. No, there aren’t any other songs on the album. It’s 2 20 minute sections of music title “thick as a brick part one” and “thick as a brick part 2”.

AskReddit,fpdwsgb,t3_gcna0k,1588535801.0,"Gonna answer because there’s no way more than 3 people see this anyway.

I’m not necessarily an incel but relationships have been very hard for me. It didn’t even really occur to me that I could be in a relationship with people until I was maybe in 7th grade. I had my grade school crushes before then, and I even had a minecraft girlfriend who lived halfway across the states, but relationships just weren’t my priority. 

I don’t really remember when it happened, but I was raped some summer in middle school. I have proof that I was at the place where it happened but I went to this same summer party a few times and all of my memories of the location are very very blurry.

Since then, I’ve been on the road to realizing that I’m trans. The road hasn’t been that long in the grand scheme of things, but that doesn’t change the 5 or so years I spent forcing myself to try to be attracted to women. I still have a few friends that I had sort of soft asked out that must have realized “wtf are they doing I thought they were gay or something” because most of them just said no but we’re actually better friends to me after, which is funny. 

I don’t have an end to this because I’m still not doing that good with relationships. I did just have my first boyfriend. That was very nice, but I guess I’m over bearing and he couldn’t handle my need for attention, which is fine and I don’t blame him, it just hurts. I might be getting better at this at some point but I need to lose some weight and actually start to transition before I imagine myself being “datable” by an average person. I’m not calling people shallow or anything for not finding me attractive, I still look like a [straighter haired version of Flo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Volman), I guess I haven’t found my eddy yet."

It was in a conversation shortly after that where I felt like it would be a bad idea to tell him before I move out. I was going to ask him if he’s maybe give me the money to go get a manicure with my mom (who doesn’t know but probably wouldn’t care). But even when he responded somewhat aggressively to me asking for the money I was able to say “just a business manicure, I want to go with mom”. He responded “yeah business manicures are nice, but you don’t have to be worried about getting your nails done”. He did say that somewhat forcefully :/

I had to come home to grab something when I had makeup on and that was just so hard. We have a listening room for vinyl records and Cd’s and I was hoping he would be in there but instead he was in the kitchen which is next to the entrance to my room. I farted right past and didn’t say a single word. He said “it would be nice if you at least said hi” which kind of hurt because I know he loves me, but I just couldn’t look at him. 

I was able to call him and play it off later. I have this thing where I hate directly lying to my dad, and I end up saying half lies because full lies make me feel like shit. So I told him that “I had makeup on because I lost a bet”.

Not being able to take anything is sometimes a curse and a blessing. I wish I could take the stuff, of course, but it’s such a change and I’m still very scared of it all.

I’m sure that you’re glasses look fuckin stellar on you! You already have good taste if you like mine lol.(that sounds very egotistical but I’m not going back on it)

Even more hearts

transvoice,fm1nu9a,t1_fm16vie,1585681804.0,"I’m not at all offended! I think what you said is right so it wouldn’t really matter if you had said it previously or not.

The pitch range was one of the easiest things to get down actually since I’ve been very involved with singing for a long time I had much better control of my pharynx than I think most people do going into this. That being said, I still could go a bit higher, but maybe that will come over time. I don’t want to strain my voice, lol.

I’ve seen L’s guides I think, but the main ones that I have been using have been Z’s guides from the YouTube channel [TransVoiceLessons](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBYlEnfAUbrYSwF0VujcmHA). She talks a lot about the harmonic series, and being a musician since I was born, it’s something that I already have a slight familiarity with. I also really like her presentation and energy. That being said however, I’ll look back at L’s guides the next time I’m working on it.

I’m filming myself for a few reasons. One of those being, I want to be able to look back at myself through different parts of my journey and actually see and hear what I was like. We have an amazing opportunity these days to keep a moment of our lives alive forever and I want to take advantage of that for the sake of keeping my story alive. Another reason being, the next time I post here, I plan on having a much much better voice, and makeup. Maybe it’s the karma whore in me but I feel like a video of me with a promising voice and masculine face next to a video of my beautiful cute voice and cute face later could really get a lot of attention.

Anyways, thanks for the comment, and thank you for listening to me talk and supporting me, it really means a lot.

❤️❤️❤️

transvoice,fm1m85e,t1_fm1fc4o,1585680967.0,"Thank you! I know my voice isn’t perfect right now but I’m very excited because I personally feel like a lot of progress has been made in such a little time and I feel very happy to finally be doing something to transition. I’m still quite young so I still worry about the safety involved with doing any t blockers or anything. 

My opinion may change on this subject the further I explore who I am but for right now, for *me*, I think transitioning is going to have to be a self betterment thing. I won’t physically look like a girl for a long time because of my body weight. Although, if I lose weight and can start wearing makeup and feminine clothing, it will satisfy me until I get old enough to feel comfortable doing medication and the like. 

Also I’m secretly hoping that if I wait that procedures and medication are going to get better in the time from now til then.

Also THANK YOU I love how these glasses look. I’ve had them for a while now and it feels so nice to be complimented on them. 

❤️❤️❤️

Anxiety,flye56f,t3_frlefs,1585600462.0,Was playing vr chat with my boyfriend and I got a chao avatar. We went into a peaceful worth that was just a house. He sat down and tabbed out to go do something and I was just sitting on his in game lap. It felt nice.
egg_irl,fly7jbe,t1_flxn9v9,1585596986.0,"I’m in the process of transitioning and this had never really occurred to me but it is kind of funny now that you bring it up. 

My male friends have all been very sexually active in the last few years (were all late teens now), and even the ones who haven’t been have been trying to brag about it. People have asked me why I don’t try to “get any” and I’ve always had my past sexual abuse as an excuse but like, honestly, it’s really just because I could care less. I’d rather be in a committed, loving relationship like the one I’m in now with my boyfriend, rather than one with a hot chick who constantly wants sex, even if I’m still somewhat more attracted to females sexually.

I wonder what they think about me transitioning. I don’t look that different yet but I’m working on my voice and I’ve done makeup a few times, I just wonder how they see me considering they are a bunch of immature late teenagers. Honestly even if it takes time for them to accept me, I don’t care, they are my family now and I love them."

I do think that we are obviously going to have different goals when transitioning considering you’re FtM and I’m MtF, and I don’t mean to invalidate you if part of your goals are being more stoic or whatever it might be. 

I just hope that you can be who you are meant to be, and that the journey is one filled with love and acceptance."
TransyTalk,flv40os,t1_flv3kf4,1585515904.0,"I’m actually still really happy to be stuck at home, I’m starting some voice feminization training and I am also getting very serious about losing weight again. I feel like I will only cease to hate being in this body when I stop liking like a fat man and more like an androgynous one so that way I can do makeup and change my voice to really seal the deal so to speak.

This is just an assumption but you seemed to imply that you also suffer from PTSD and I just want to say that I’m really sorry if that’s true.

Also I think it’s very interesting just how different everyone’s experience with weed has been."
