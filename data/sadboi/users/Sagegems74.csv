SuicideWatch,fqpa7ee,t3_gk5s5j,1589540455.0,"It's hard to give confident advice when you're not a medical professional, so what I say here is simply what I think or feel.

The average person does not think suicide or self harm is an option when life is going poorly or they have worries, if you do that is indicative of depression. If your level of fear is causing you to feel like death is preferable to dealing with it, that's indicative of anxiety issues.

Many people are surrounded by family who simply don't understand mental health issues, so I definitely see how hard that must be for you. But for your safety I think you might want to give it a try talking to them. Neither of my parents ever dealt with these things, old school, hard working types ya know? But when I spilled these feelings they payed attention. My mother especially noted that she became most concerned because I acknowledged out loud that I knew this thinking wasn't right but that I couldn't make it stop. She felt compelled to rescue me she said, the same as if I was drowning and she could lift me up.

I don't know how things will go with your family, but I think you are worth trying. Give them a chance to help. You may be surprised."

Husband was his favorite buddy for sure but not a comforter. My husband discovered that this kid was a helper though. He funneled the dad lessons into that. He let him ""help"" on projects and fixes, Made kiddo feel important and valued. Dad got extra chances to impart lessons and teach patience.

That kid is 14 now. He just got accepted into an applied sciences high school for engineering. Guess what? My cuddles didn't do that. Dad's time did.

Here's the reality. Prolactin gives a feeling of satisfaction and relaxation it has zero to do with arousal. In sexual encounters it's released AFTERWARDS and leaves you with that cozy, comfy afterglow. It's released during lactation to create those warm fuzzies with baby. Giving you a pump of relaxation juice to get you to push through sore breasts, cracked nipples, etc
