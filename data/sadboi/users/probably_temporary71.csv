That kind of thing is how you'd treat an animal or a 4 year old. How is that supposed to improve anyone's mental state? IMO it is crazy how much power a provider has over a mentally ill patient. It seems clear to me, unless I'm missing something, that either you or your roommate did not belong in that place and something should have been done immediately.

Not just things with inpatient, but even situations where you're seeing a psychiatrist, have a fallout or disagreement, and consequently your source of meds vanishes.

lexapro,erzmvpd,t1_erzahaa,1561441752.0,"The weaning was bad. I've heard it is so bad for some people that they stay on Lexapro for their entire lives, and there's no guarantee that getting off will be as easy for me next time. But it wasn't just that.

I felt like Lexapro was useful in order to train my mind to not use anxiety as the go-to emotion.  There's definitely been some re-wiring going on in there. I'm still prone to social anxiety, but no longer anxious about nearly everything which involves me leaving the house.

But outside of that - I was depressed not because of a chemical imbalance but partly because I have a lifestyle which is a very poor fit for who I am as a person. A lot of that can't be changed. But on top of that, and I didn't grasp this at the time, I was dealing with some toxic people. The Lexapro allowed me to tolerate that stuff and switch off.  But tolerating and switching off is not how I needed to respond to what was going on. It required some ultimatums, some telling people to back the fuck off, and a lot of, ""I'm not doing that shit anymore"". It required the same 'fight or flight' responses that Lexapro was shutting off.

What I'm trying to say is that Lexapro helped me but also took away a certain edge, and I feel that you need some sort of an edge to stay in control of your life and especially to break out of clinical depression.

I made a conscious decision a few months back that I would not spend the remainder of my life in a haze.  I wanted things to come to a head and either I'd die or I'd rearrange my lifestyle to better fit me, come to terms with my mental problems, and return to something like the person I was a decade ago. It's been hard. 4 days ago I was standing at this same desk, making sure my accounts had the correct beneficiaries set up so I could go kill myself with a clear mind. But most of the time I am feeling better and I don't regret taking this course.

I might use things for acute anxiety, like Xanax once a month or some Kratom. And I'm very fond of Vyvanse for my ADHD, but I won't take anything which impacts me all the time again.

**TL;DR** \- Lexapro clouds my mind and I can't have that anymore if I want to recover."
lexapro,erywhwq,t3_c4tww7,1561419333.0,"I quit recently and made a post about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/lexapro/comments/baz6hm/one_month_since_i_decided_to_quit/). It sucked, and if you taper too quickly it can incapacitate you.

Lexapro had its uses for me. I'm glad I took it. But now that I'm off it I will never take it again unless it is a life or death situation.

I had used it for 4 years. I went from 20 mg to 10, which was nothing in my experience. Then after a couple of weeks on 10, I went 7.5 for a week, 5 for a week, 2.5 for a week and then tried to quit entirely. A week later I realized I'd barely been able to move for 3 days, so I took 10 mg, stayed at 5 for a week, 2.5 for 2-3 weeks, then stopped and I had no significant issues.

It sounds like you're tapering too fast. Pretty much taper as slowly as you can. You really can't taper off an SSRI too slowly.

If I was coming down from 20 today, I'd do:

10 mg for 2 weeks.

7.5 for a week

5 for 2 weeks

2.5 for 3 weeks.

And I'd watch myself closely - any problems I'd go back up to the higher dose for another week. There's no shame in it.

Now that I'm off it I find I have a lot less trouble with anxiety than I did before taking it. The doctor said the goal was not to be on Lexapro my whole life but to rewire my brain - to train it to respond differently to certain situations other than with anxiety. And it worked for that. I have some anger problems now, but I think that's just me and not the withdrawals.

I also had depression, but as I came off the stuff and gained more energy it changed into a more active, dangerous form of depression. Like, I'd have 6 suicidal ideations a day while on it, but nothing where I'd actually take any action. Off it, I have an ideation every few weeks but while in that frame of mind I'm literally drafting a suicide note and arranging my affairs. I am just as organized and active about it as if I were planning a vacation, and I'm absolutely capable of killing myself while in that mode.

It's a dangerous time and you have to watch yourself closely. But it is worth it once you start emerging out of the other side.

**TL;DR -** Slow down with the tapering. Watch for the usual Lexapro withdrawal symptoms and learn to tell  active suicidal thoughts from passive ones. Don't be afraid to go back to a higher dose temporarily if things are getting too rough. Also, I did it alone but I wouldn't recommend that to others. If you're still on decent terms with your psychiatrist I'd let them know what you're doing and how you feel."

I also have Aspergers and ADHD along with my depression. I was undiagnosed till late in life, like most Gen X'ers with these problems, and consequently I did not have my first relationship till I was 27 and really didn't start 'life' at all until I was in my 30's. My life is a long list of failures and embarrassments and maybe a handful of wins. And even starting the race 15 years late, with a record like mine, I see there are still people out there who are doing a lot worse than I am now. Not because I'm smart or well-adjusted, but simply because I haven't done the stupid shit that most people do - intentionally making myself miserable to meet some external standard or expectation.

In many respects, being in your cocoon will help you long term. Because it protects you from making the stupid mistakes that a lot of people make. A lot of the more well adjusted kids fall in love, have kids at 19, then divorced at 30 and by the time they're 35 they have so much baggage they can hardly walk. I'm guessing that you have no external baggage that stops you from doing things you want to do.. not yet. Your life is still fresh and many people would love that. I know I would.

By the time you are out there and interacting with things as a 'normal' person, you're going to have more wisdom and that stupid stuff with all the drama that other people bring? You're never going to experience it as long as you follow your best judgement. You're also never going to feel the need to follow society's expectations and do things you don't want to do. You're already outside the norm of society and so you can do what you want now.

There's a lot of young people here and I try not to comment about age because it is easy to sound condescending. But if you're below 25, it's hard for me to express how much time you really have ahead of you, and how you're going to be a completely different person, in a completely different situation, in 10 years. You have so much time. By the time you're 45, 50, it will not matter whether you found yourself at 17 or at 32.

depression,erqz95o,t3_c3dajf,1561155896.0,"Absolutely true in my experience and I've worked at a lot of places. You do not tell your employer *anything* that might make them think you'll be unproductive or that you sit more than a certain standard deviation from the norm.

I also agree about EAP. That makes me think of other things I've seen in companies - arcade machines and rest areas. Yes, they're there. And employers can then show outsiders that they have them. But god forbid you should be seen using those things yourself.

If you have the days available, it's none of your employers business why you need time off. If they press me, I reason that they shouldn't be doing that and therefore I'm allowed to lie if need be.

I'll also add that not telling people, co-workers, whatever, about your issues should always be the rule. You might think you're cool with someone, but they might not regard you the same way. Even if you are cool, relationships change. People talk. And once your problems leave your mouth you are no longer in control of who gets told and what, specifically, they get told.

It sucks. But that's reality. The choice is, you can fight your battles largely alone but reap the benefits of being a 'normal' person in society. Or you can be 'mentally ill' and people will have lowered expectations, do/say some condescending shit, or assume you're going to rape their children.

Other than that I wouldn't trust these products simply because they aren't required to compete against anything. Take that Amway toothpaste, Glister.

So it helped settle me down, but also helped me tolerate stuff that I shouldn't have had to, or been, tolerating. There's been a lot of 'I'm not doing that shit anymore' for me over the last few months.

I agree that depression became, and still feels like, my identity. And it was a source of comfort and bonding. Still is. My only real conversations were at places like this and on topics like this. The people I spoke to regularly were mostly online and all as depressed as I was. I felt that only depressed people 'got it', and that anyone else was either blowing smoke or actively harming the situation.

Regardless of how this turns out for me, I'll never forget the stories I've heard and the mental places I've been over the past few years. I'll never forget what some other people have gone through and the problems with the system. If I survive this I'll be a lot stronger and wiser than I was 10 years ago.

These days I'm trying to work out a lot more, get out a bit (although that will never be my thing. I was extremely introverted even before depression hit), and generally interact with people in a more healthy, less bitter way. But I still have to fight some of the same issues that made me depressed in the first place, along with all of the atrophy I've experienced. God, it will take at least a year to get close to where I used to be physically. It's really off-putting, not climbing new heights but just trying to get back to a peak that you once stood on top of.

The thing is, when I'm down my ideas and activities regarding setting up a suicide are just as organized and active as if I were planning a vacation or a workout plan. It seems perfectly reasonable to me and I am building towards it in a 'reasonable' way. Even though I know academically that this is not normal, I'm really not able to see that in a practical sense.

But if I don't go through this I'll never get better. It worked out for you, so there's a lot of hope for me too.

What I did was be in a non-energy state for 5 years. Then around 3 months ago I felt somewhat better, then I felt really bad, then I felt better, then I felt really bad, and now I'm feeling better again. I was in each phase for maybe a week or two. Now, when I say 'really bad', I don't mean like I was before - depressed and inactive. I mean  just as depressed but mobile and clear minded, and much closer mentally to actively doing something. I'm guessing those are the dangerous times.

I'm still not out of it yet. I find that my moods are really volatile. Depression is still a problem and now anger is starting to be a problem too. IMO anger is a different side of depression; just active instead of passive. At least I can channel anger into exercise.

My mother and father in law were in China during the Great Leap Forward when millions of people were starving to death and being executed. So in their case, those worst case scenarios were actually true.

But they then have carried that mentality for the rest of their lives, and have destroyed their kids with it. Everything is the worst possible outcome. Everything is terrible.

They all dress as if their house caught fire and they had to go out in whatever they had on at the time.

And it's not even logical, how they do things. Like I keep a stock of water bottles and food stashed away, maybe enough to last for 2 weeks, in the case of an emergency.

I actually suffer from depression. I actually do despise being a parent (but not my son ofc), and I feel like I was coerced and cheated. But I would never bring everyone down by airing out things publicly like that in front of my friends and family. How do they think that makes their kids feel?

It wasn't abusive. It didn't tell them that they made a bad decision for themselves, only that he and his wife personally agreed with that sentiment and chose not to have kids because of it. All he did was state their opinion on the topic. When pushed.

If I make a statement to a CF friend (which I'd never do in writing because I don't want that misread and getting back to my son someday) that being a parent is hard and it sucks, the last thing I'd expect them to do is kiss my ass about it or tell me shit that we both know isn't true.

It's not just a CF thing either. If you have a friend who has a strongly opposing opinion to you, on *anything*, then we all have kind of an unspoken agreement to not touch on that topic, right? I mean, don't we all do that out of respect? They broke that rule, chose to bait OP and the husband about it and got a pretty reasonable response in return. Then grossly overreacted.

I was on 3 things - an SSRI, Vyvanse, and Xanax. I've been fine without the other stuff, just by making life changes. Mainly telling people, ""That will make me miserable and I'm not going to do it"", and generally staying within my limits. The parenting burden pushed me out of that mode for a couple of years, but I've realized I can't be an effective parent, or an effective anything, if I'm trying to live life in a way I'm just not capable of doing.

So that's all well and good but without the Vyvanse, I've gotten back into the old bad habits I've always had. Just very hard to get myself moving, and easily distracted when I do move.

Then, and you know how it is, people don't look at that and say to themselves, ""Hes not able to get going because he has ADHD and he's depressed"". They just say, ""What a lazy piece of shit"". Even I say that to myself at times, and I know better. And that stuff reinforces all of the other negative thoughts I used to have and is putting me back in a spiral. Depression, resentment, and increasing levels of anger. I sure don't want to go back there again.

I chose the 'fuck you' response, but getting in with another psychiatrist in my area has proven to be impossible and now I have no meds. Did I do the right thing?

Mental health patients are often treated like shit because the truth is that we need those doctors (or the meds they gatekeep at least) and they don't need us. Those doctors seem to be acutely aware of that dynamic too IMHO. If one of their patients tells them where to go, or drops out of touch, or kills themselves then there's no shortage of other patients willing to pay their money and take that slot.

IMO they don't seem to really regard themselves as real doctors either based on how unprofessional they can be, and don't regard the people they see as having 'real' issues.

My impression of a practice is that they might have, say 200 patients. During a year, 15 improve, 170 stay the same and 15 die. Then out of the people who contacted them and couldn't get in or weren't replied to, 15 of them might have died too. There's no real caring, no accountability. A patient comes and visits a typical doctor, gets surgery or what have you and dies. People ask questions. A depressed patient sees a psychiatrist and 3 months later commits suicide. People shrug, no-one asks about the treatment, and the psychiatrist now has an opening for a new patient (not for less than $240/hr of course). Either way its no biggie. If anything gets said to the psychiatrist it is probably some words of comfort. I doubt they'd even attend the funeral.

And they have the nerve to act so smug about what they do. Anyone who puts mental health professionals on a pedestal needs to visit r/depression or any one of the other mental health subs, where sufferers post, and see what *those* people think of the job they're doing.

Your psychologist should be absolutely ashamed of themselves. Both the charge and the use of the word 'irresponsible' in a situation like that. It is disgusting and it shows a complete lack of understanding for what they're dealing with. You should cross post that to r/depression. I'm sure other people have dealt with the same, and perhaps they can offer you advice on avoiding that charge.

Like just raising your hand is going to bring a stream of help and everything will be taken care of. Fuck off. IRL no-one wants to hear about this shit, and that reality is incredibly demoralizing to depressed people who have always been told differently.

Want to know what thought inspires me? What kind of shit I tell myself?

*""I need to help myself. No-one else will. Put my own happiness first until I get better, and make my best effort to be physically active. If I go a day without moving forward, that's OK. Try tomorrow. I have to keep going or I will die.""*

It's bleak and I'm not saying it's good advice, but I seem to have improved since I stopped trying to reach out and made my recovery a little bit of 'me vs the world'.

Of course I believe professionals help some people, but in my own experience and from the stories I've heard they are pretty damn far from the heroes they are made out to be."
ADHD,epmz4a1,t1_epm68tu,1559319160.0,"IMHO we get different kinds of judgement as a guy. Once you've revealed you're not neurotypical, no matter what the diagnosis, some people seem to suspect you capable of all kinds of terrible things.

I've really come to hate the duality in society. People with mental issues (depression in particular although this isn't the right sub for that) are told to reach out and talk things over. It's constantly drilled into everyone's heads. But in practice, no-one actually wants to hear that shit except for other people who suffer from the same thing. Revealing something of this nature, in my experience, has usually turned out to be something I regret. And you can't unsay things.

And the professionals? In my area, it's damn hard to even **see** a professional, much less get one who is really on your side.

IRL I don't tell people shit anymore unless I absolutely have to. Nothing wrong here!"

There are also some places where a guy might get the crap beaten out of him if they call another man a bitch, so it's not just women who might be offended at it.

I don't think you even made a mistake. You had no way of knowing. Just don't say it again."

We can imagine it. I'm not exaggerating when I say that in America, it was perfectly legal for members of congress to indulge in insider trading until pretty recently. Well, maybe not 'legal' in the strict sense but commonly done (by both sides) and accepted. IIRC they only started to make some laws regarding congress and insider trading in 2015 or so.

By US standards, it seems like the only thing he did wrong was tell his staffers to vote for Brexit and I'm not sure that would get him more than a good talking to."
AmItheAsshole,ep71213,t1_ep59z3p,1559076007.0,That's not an official source. That source is a pretty pertinent fact you left out of your OP there - just like you're claiming the family members did in their request.

Wow... leaving out a detail is one thing but that is something else entirely. That is some stone cold gall right there. Honestly I'd have a hard time trusting anyone in that family after that."
childfree,ep6x1e9,t3_bu1yf7,1559074616.0,"God, as a father I have heard so many of these. Whenever I hear something like, ""Your time is not your own anymore"" and the trendy modern shit about no longer being a ""dude"" but a ""dad"" I want to hang myself.

If you weren't depressed about parenting going in, you'll sure as hell be depressed after 'motivation' that other parents give you. I'm actually beginning to think that the key to surviving parenting is to avoid other parents as much as possible.

IMO people who are pleased about something like this were never the picture and never believed they could be the picture. I've met a lot of people like that. The frame is the best thing they ever believed they could be, and they're pretty damn flimsy frames at that."
AmItheAsshole,ep563xl,t1_ep55k3r,1559051096.0,I hope she's not your friend anymore. Who shakes down a friend for money like that? Why couldn't they pay for their own damn trip?
AmItheAsshole,ep55xpl,t3_bu027k,1559051020.0,"NTA. I see that the vote is split. Would the vote be the same if the guy had been drunk? That irresponsible asshat could have put someone else in a wheelchair or killed them.

They certainly shouldn't ask for money without providing more detail. In fact telling the whole story, about any situation, should be a requirement when asking strangers for money. I'm not saying strangers shouldn't donate (though I wouldn't). But they should at least know the full circumstances."
AmItheAsshole,ep55bv6,t3_bu02ro,1559050770.0,"NTA, of course. No neighbor ever asks or expects this of another.

And I'd make damn sure - absolutely sure - that the property line is where they're claiming it is. For that reason, I don't think it's even legal to just randomly build a fence like that without contacting a surveyor. Where I live, you can't just build structures on your property without the township being involved."

If they sell action figures of this, I want one. New Zealanders must be extremely happy people.

**Edit:** Took a quick look and there are no action figures of this. Why?"
childfree,eonx7el,t1_eonrocj,1558723795.0,"How nice! That's not the response I expected.

And to give you your due, since becoming a parent I've got nothing but contempt for dads who don't get involved with their kids and be a major part of their lives. 

Personally, I've got some mental/emotional issues that I deal with and almost **no one** has less natural aptitude and ability to be a parent than I do. On top of that I absolutely hate most aspects of parenting. I feel that I have no business being a dad, and my wife/in-laws could not have chosen a worse man to coerce into fatherhood.

But despite that I try my best. I have to. And if someone like me is able to do a decent job then there's no excuse for any mentally and physically healthy man to fail as a father.

Anyway, thanks for that. Have a great weekend!"
childfree,eonwrig,t1_eondx9p,1558723484.0,">Is her mother in the picture at all?

That I don't know. I only ran into her the one time. She was well dressed and groomed, so luckily she's got someone who watches out for her.

My guess - my hope - is that the mom or whoever is usually on top of things. But Dad was told to pick up some of the slack for that one day and was resentful about doing so. I really hope Gia makes it, but there's a lot of Gias out there."
childfree,eon9rna,t1_eolwjmq,1558707484.0,"Believe me, when you were a kid and people saw you, it was plain as day to a lot of observers what was going on and there was nothing they could do.

At that age it's especially tragic. I'd say at 3 and 4 there aren't any really 'bad' kids. I've never met a kid that age that I can't get along with (and I'm not a huge kid person which is why I'm here). 3 and 4 year olds are honest, trusting, friendly, and curious. It's their default factory setting. And you look and you know their parents are destroying all that and there's absolutely nothing you can do.

Since becoming a parent I have a much higher opinion of kids, as people, than I did as a cf person. Don't get me wrong, I'm not happy being a parent. But based on personality, most young kids are OK. But I've developed a raging dislike and contempt for the parenting community and I see the harm they're doing constantly. A lot of them are awful. Not always awful parents but awful, entitled, closed minded people. Bleh.

Sorry for ranting. I dragged that out more than I wanted."
childfree,eon8tse,t1_eomoaam,1558706915.0,"Even if she makes it past childhood without having to deal with a pedophile, she'll have no chance at all when it comes time to deal with relationships. And I see a lot of kids that are being actively and passively screwed up in my view. It's sad because at 3 and 4 it's very rare to see a bad kid. They're almost universally friendly, trusting, honest, and curious unless they're really upset about something. And you watch the parents with some of these kids and you know that those positive traits are going to wither and die.

A fair amount of my dislike of being a parent is other parents. Even a lot of the ones who do try with their kids take it to the other extreme. They either don't let their kid do anything, indoctrinate their kids with hardcore religious beliefs, or act like selfish, offensive asshats to other adults. I have to exist in this community of people who I absolutely hate and have nothing in common with for the most part.

Honestly I'll miss some aspects of my son being 4 - playing with him and talking to him is pretty cool, along with all of the imaginative play. But when he gets older at least I won't have to interact with other parents as much."

Plenty of men end up with bad partners too. An awful lot of us are coerced or tricked into family situations that we never wanted or asked for. But that doesn't mean anything negative regarding women as a whole. It just means something about those particular women.

It sounds like you made a poor choice in picking a partner and that is a 'you' problem, not a problem with men overall."
