EatingDisorders,fqvnjvj,t3_gksno8,1589681054.0,"ah i literally could have written this exact post, also in recovery for a year, new BP meds messing with appetite, gradually meal skipping, lying to therapist and boyfriend, i relate to it all!!! 

I am sorry you're struggling right now, and you are most definitely not alone in this struggle! EDs often stem from and reinforce feelings of shame, and EDs are super secretive! if people know, it adds a degree of accountability and means people could check on you, but if its a secret then you can be alone with your ED. its a nasty cycle :(

I commend you for writing this post! Acknowledging the relapse and asking for help is definitely a super important step. As mentioned above I recommend letting someone know. I know its hard, but it might help you feel less alone if its someone supportive. Last week I finally confessed to my therapist that I have been struggling with my food again, and we had a very productive helpful conversation that both acknowledged how difficult things are right now and discussed how I can turn things around before they get worse. Sadly, left alone with your EDs is not an easy place to pull yourself out of all alone. And theres no shame in needing that help, and asking for it. In fact, its the strongest and bravest thing you can do for yourself right now!

Best of luck, and feel free to message me if you need to vent. Sending so much love"
EatingDisorders,fqn00hw,t3_gjgzgc,1589486371.0,"i struggled a lot with this too in the worst of my ED and throughout much of my recovery. something that helped me was removing the full length mirror from my bedroom and replacing with one chest up to do my hair and makeup but not body check. i also take my eye contacts out before i shower lol so that i cant really see my body in the bathroom! 
another option that my ed treatment center suggested was covering my mirrors. you can even have a fun day of painting and drawing pictures or recovery oriented quotes on paper to use to cover!! 
i have also purged my closet of anything that didnt make me feel confident. a shirt that the fit made me hate my shoulders, a pair of pants i felt gave me weird love handles. its hard but really feeling comfortable in your clothes is so important. and i dont think it has to be all hoodies and sweats!! i now love overalls and loose jumpsuits/rompers, palazzo pants, t shirt dresses. stuff thats comfy and wont make me self conscious but is also cute!!
i have come a long way but i still struggle. i think a key step and what now and then helped me the most, is interrupting it. practice mindfulness and when you notice yourself doing it, try to redirect that energy or attention to something else. its super hard especially when its such a compulsive thing, but practice makes it (somewhat) easier.
you got this!!!💗"
BipolarSOs,fqfvha1,t1_fqftodm,1589332498.0,"Yeah it definitely sounds like he is going through a rough time as well and some of that is beyond you, and he probably needs to work through a lot of that simultaneously with this! Do what you can to offer support but allow him space to process. I think it will be important that he processes and sets boundaries for a healthy relationship moving forward, so that this situation doesn't happen again.

Its really hard to reconcile who you know you are with how you can act sometimes- or at least it is for me. I know I am a kind loving person, but I have, because of my illness, acted in ways that don't reflect that. That doesn't excuse it and make it okay, but it does offer context and insight as to how to best go about addressing it! I am sure you love and care about him and even if your actions stem from your illness, it still is not fair for him to to go through. I'm glad I could offer some comfort, people's advice and kind words have helped me immensely on here as well, so I am happy to try"
BipolarSOs,fqfq988,t3_gilyzq,1589329595.0,"I'm sorry you're going through a rough time right now, and I've definitely been there. 

 until my current relationship, I had never had a healthy relationship. From the combo of abusive/toxic partners & my tendency to act how you described above (threatening to break up over every fight, being mean, and writing the other person as in the wrong and not analyzing my own behaviors), I have been in very unhealthy relationships. My last relationship ended similarly, in which he was definitely horrible to me, but I can now see how unbelievably toxic I was to him. since being diagnosed, I have reflected A LOT about my past behaviors and patterns and think that has allowed me to be in the healthy and functioning relationship I am in today.

My advice, as previously mentioned, give space for him to process his emotions right now as he deserves that. Try to reframe this from being about you (I know-hard to do) and frame it about his needs. Of course you don't want him to break up with you, but I think focusing on what you can do as an individual and as a partner is more important. What are some of the things that were contributing to the way you were acting? Why was he the outlet for your unmanaged emotions? What concrete things can you do to prevent this from happening again? Are there times you caught yourself in your actions/ do you think you are capable of doing that, and what will you do to switch your behavior? Do you think it is appropriate to ask him to call you out on your behavior, and would you respond gracefully? (ie I ask my partner to tell me if I am being unfair or irrational and I trust that he does so only when it is genuinely true, as in the past I have had a tendency to believe I was right and my partners were wrong and evil and mean) Is that a burden he is able to carry, or is that unfair to him? If he has been in an abusive relationship in the past he may not know when to stand up for himself, and allow himself to be a punching bag, in which case that wouldnt work. 

I think if you love him as I am sure you do, try to reframe from worry about a breakup to worry about the (potential and past) pain you caused him and ways to prevent that from happening in the future, and discuss these things when he is ready.

Best of luck xxx"
bipolar,fp6kph2,t3_gbkg77,1588354001.0,ahhh yes i said this to my therapist after starting my first mood stabilizer. it almost upset me to learn how much of my internal chaos was just my brain and not how everyone else lived. but was also reassuring in the diagnosis

if you havent, i really suggest talking w your psychiatrist about your concerns and looking for alternatives?? i know the options are super super limited, but medication thats supposed to bring u mental stability but worsens your eating disorder is pretty counter productive.

bipolar2,foocokc,t3_g8h5ib,1587936636.0,"i take a stimulant daily, and have for 2 years now. personally as someone w bipolar2 and adhd, stimulants really really help me. it helps with emotional regulation, time regulation, and lifts me out of depression better than any of the many antidepressants i have tried because it allows me the motivation to do the things i need to do and also makes things that usually seem daunting seem much more approachable. 

i would talk to your psychiatrist and figure out whats best for you :) i have bounced around doses but been on vyvanse for 2 years now and truly has been so amazing for me. as a controlled substance it can be a pain sometimes so a few times ive been out of it for a few days or i have rationed it and only taken a few times a week and those have given me good insight as to how much it improves my quality of life. 

i know its generally like frowned upon as being bad for us w bipolar, but my psych has always been super supportive of it and validating, and in times i was rationing it and later told her, she was like ""wow im so sorry that must really be affecting your mood/depression"" etc. 

try a low dose and see! i have never liked adderall as it makes me feel like super on edge/ increased anxiety, but vyvanse has been amazing for me so i really recommend it. its expensive bc theres no generic, with insurance mine is 30$ for 30 pills but to me its worth it."

She looks beautiful from where she's hanging so I thought she was happy and healthy. She's also been putting out a lot of new growth!

But today I took her down bc I was inspecting all my plants after a mealy bug scare, and i realized a lot of her roots are browning/dry. I read a zillion posts on here & r/succulents and have seen a lot of advice to cut off the healthy and replant/repot.

However, before doing this, I just want to make sure that is the best plan of action for her?

plantclinic,fmt5joh,t3_fxar40,1586367206.0,"my cordyline has slowly been dying and i dont know why! she had fungus gnats which i just killed with a round of mosquito bits, but im not sure that is the cause.
her top leaves have been developing browning tips. lower leaves have turned completely brown and some are crispy and fall off but some i have to remove. 
i try to water only when dry but i might have overwatered?? i am new to houseplants. how can i check for root rot/ know if if is?? 
i also read they are susceptible to fluoride toxicity, i dont have access to distilled water right now bc of covid19 but could that be the cause?? if so, will the fluoride kill her or just be unattractive??

for info: i live in socal, its been rainy ish. she gets indirect light from sought and west facing windows."
plantclinic,fm2wfv6,t1_fm2kknt,1585707004.0,"thank you for replying! mines not looking too hot, i also have been watering about once a week and think I need to cut back too"
plantclinic,fm1wh2v,t3_ffjirq,1585686252.0,mine looks like this too! have you had any luck? i read theyre sensitive to the fluoride and chlorine in water so they need distilled water. im gonna try that and hopefully she springs back
learnart,flfq7wz,t3_fokskm,1585113939.0,"a few things im struggling with: 

the stems/branches?? i dont know how to shape them- bent or straight or wiggly?

colors, i feel like when trying to darken my colors for depth and shadows i always end up with muddy colors

when i do paint something, not making it look so exact? i feel like my strokes dont look brush-like, they just look very exact and harsh. maybe i just dont like this because i am used to watercolor and softer lines, but i feel like each stem/branch i just want to smudge the edges to soften it?"

SkincareAddiction,fffeq2j,t1_ffez9cs,1579882347.0,"thank you!!!  a few questions:

i have been using micellar water before my cetaphil to take off makeup, is it better to use an oil cleanser?


should I wait some time before starting azelaic acid/ incorporate it slowly into my routine? or is it okay for me to start that now? 

my am moisturizer has spf 30, should i be using sunscreen outside of this? 

when exfoliating, is that just a wash cloth and water? or do i use my gentle cleanser as well?

thanks for your help! i have much more hope :)"
