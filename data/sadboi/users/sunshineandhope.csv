Been a while since the fight happened, so I have had some time to think about your comment. It resonated with a lot of random thoughts going on in my head and has helped put some perspective to those thoughts. :)

I guess, I keep doing to him - what he almost did yesterday.

When he said 'always sad' that felt like he was erasing all my efforts. sadly, i have done and said much worse to him in the past during my anger.

His bad behaviour may not always be linked to you. Not everything is about you, and that's a GOOD THING.
in my husband's case, it was his work stress.

And that doesn't justify his behavior, but neither does it take anything away from our relationship or me.

 that maybe his opinions are prejudiced agiant me, and has in fact, a lot to do with all the stress he has been dealing with at work too.

Worst of all, feeling guilty yet angry. Desperately wnating the fight to be over, yet feeling like you don't want to settle down for such behaviour or accept his logic.

If this helps,
Maybe just remind yourself to be kind. Kindness is so important in relationships.

Take one step at a time, observe your thoughts, maybe even write them down somewhere. As a learning experience. It really helps to read these thoughts later.

Give it a few hours and then try talking to him patiently.

BPD,fpq7dof,t1_fpp3o0s,1588816650.0,"That's seriously so messed up. Glad that you are trying to be okay, and that you have have so much potential to be okay!

As a recovering BPD, if I may share something...

I crave for that simple innocent life too.  The one that I missed during my own childhood, because I was desperately trying to grow up, to cope with my parents.

And I haven't forgiven them, I probably never will.
But I keep some distance and try not to think too much about what they said, and their drama and manipulation. It's a conscious effort.

As for being a child...

Well guess what, it's still very much possible.
Possible to have fun, to still be silly.
To fulfill all of those dreams.
To be truly, completely happy with not a care in the world.

I have decided that I don't want to be a grown up just yet. I want to make up for what I lost. And that's okay. 

 Sure I will have my responsibilities and have to work hard now, but these things are too underated.
 Having a job is not a bad thing, esp because all that financial independence is good.

Having to manage your own house by yourself is not necessarily bad either, since it means you can decorate it however you want, watch TV whatever you want, eat whatever you want and invite whoever you want.

These are things I wanted during my childhood, and now I have it. So I can have twice the fun and go absolutely bonkers enjoying my reclaimed life,!

We party a lot now, go for lots of vacations and i live my life 100% on my own terms even if some of my choices (like the clothes I wear) may seem inappropriate to others.

As for managing friendships, 
I don't have any old friends left in my life.

But, I have managed to make a few new friends since last one year - you know, since therapy started to really work.

But I keep my walls up, and maintain lots of distance from them. Like we will hang out and party every other weekend, but I won't discuss my life stories and secrets with anyone.

I am taking baby steps and not trusting people just yet. I don't invest myself too deeply, emotionally or go out my way for anybody - because then my emotions will start to spiral out of control,like my expectations.

 I spend a lot time observing them queitly though , trying to understand them and occasionally also learning thinsg about coping mechanisms, handling conflicts etc when they share their own stories.

I guess I Will get to deeper, more meaningful friendships later when I feel more confident about my own coping skills."

I realise now, that while he triggered things by saying something out of the line, I allowed myself to completely split.

He has offered to try therapy himself, and we may try couples therapy too very soon. He is incredibly stressed due to work, and pergaos things just came out wrong in anger when he said what he said.

That is not to say that he was right, or to say my splitting was the right reaction.

(I totally mean this in a good way, in terms of self awareness and mental maturity, not like you might be boring...I am sure you are not boring at all!).

Sorry to know about your childhood. There is something about having to grow up like that which makes you mature faster than you should. While at the same time, trapping that little child in you still somewhere, that craves for love.

Are you in touch with your parents? 

If this helps, one thing I can assure you after reading your posts that you will be very very successful at handling your BPD and getting 'normal' someday. I wasn't half as self aware when I was just months into therapy myself...and trust me when I say this, my recovery has been exponentially good as per my therapist and psychiatist.

So one can only imagine how well you would do for yourself. :)

Keep faith in yourself and keep working out your issues one by one. It's not an easy journey, but I am guessing it is worth it. 

For instance, I have recently started enjoying music for the first time in years, hearing beats and sounds I never noticed before in those same old tracks that I am playing now. It's crazy how BPD can block your mind to simple things in life. 

Maybe that's the beginning of my 'normal'. Though I do believe that 'normal' is a highly overrated term considering how subjective it is in the first place."

Worst part is, most BPDs actually already doubt themselves enough to immediately believe that they are at fault.

Being totally fair, he has saved me. and for that I am grateful. But our relationship is not going to be that of equals if I keep seeing myself as a BPD and him as my 'saviour'. 

Love language is also a big part of the problem. Though yes, he has been taking things a bit for granted because I am doing all that I take responsibility of what's been wrong.

Couples therapy is a good idea. Hope he will agree.

Cuz after every fight, I try to make up for my bad moods, my mistakes, and book an extra session  for therapy. I take responsibility for my actions, I talk to him about it. I apologise. 

Doesn't mean I have no self respect. Apologising is HARD! 

It makes me mad that he can't apologise - just for once - for once, without me literally begging for it!

He will just 'kinda sorta' accept his mistake after hours of me explaining to him what he did wrong - still kinda sorta really blaming me for his reactions. And oh, blaming me for making a BIG DEAL out of apology.

Apparently I am just expected to assume - since we have been together for so long - 
- that he just reacted out of anger, or that's just how he talks.
- Or that he will work on his issues by himself.

BPD,fpnt2sm,t3_gek0wm,1588772003.0,"ACTUALLY  it's proven that people with BPD are usually extremely sensitive. They feel emotions, they feel too much.

Too much empathy, too much love, too much concern.

When I, as a BPD act out, I do it because I don't know how to cope with these overwhelming emotions. I am mean to people, because when someone hurts me even a little bit, it stings. And my reactions may seem inappropriate, on the outside, but it's because I feel so bad inside. 

Over compensation.

People with BPD are actually some of the nicest people, they just are too scared to show it. So yes, I may lie and manipulate sometimes - but I am trying to just save myself from the pain.

With two years of therapy though, I have almost stopped doing that. I am kinder to myself and manage my emotions better now. So less need for overcompensation."

Please remember that you are important and that your past acts don't define you. You are worthy and one day, with therapy and some consistent efforts, you will be able to see it too :)"
TrueOffMyChest,fpnqy5a,t3_gegces,1588770638.0,Very interesting
TrueOffMyChest,for7sws,t1_foqwjk7,1588007636.0,"I am not from China. Or Japan or Korea or Pakistan either btw. 

But it sucks what you just said.

There are good people everywhere.
 the level of hate, prejudice and stupidity some people exhibit makes me wonder if we humans will ever be able to coexist in peace."

He was just a big mistake, happens.
Majority of the world understands this."
TrueOffMyChest,foq1r41,t3_g8nrsz,1587979818.0,"Most men that I have known in my life, are actually pretty nice, decent and well behaved. 
I have more male friends than female friends."
TrueOffMyChest,foppldp,t3_g8elxc,1587968109.0,"Animals are nice.

Humans are destroying each other, the planet, and are so selfish. We are capable of knowing better and doing better, yet we choose to look the other way.

My dog, on the other hand makes others her priority, and while she may not be as smart as humans, she is way more deserving of life than most humans are.

I am not saying that humans deserve to die or that one life matters more than the other.

Just that, animals are way better. And yes, I do love them way more."
TrueOffMyChest,foeyuh7,t3_g70jfc,1587719704.0,"Sounds like a hater.

P.S - I am a 'fucking' youtuber, and your misplaced anger shows that something is very very wrong with you."
TrueOffMyChest,fnr9x92,t3_g37pdn,1587182972.0,"Your feelings are valid and you don't need to feel guilty for having these thoughts.

You have gone through your own share of shit and yes, some of this has been big stuff.

Having said that, some of this may be coming from depression or some other mental health issue. so please get in touch with a therapist. You deserve to be happy in life and there is no harm is reaching out for help."
TrueOffMyChest,fnr9moj,t3_g32y3h,1587182755.0,"Gosh, this must have been so tough!

Don't let anybody convince you that you need to be good to this family or that you owe anything to them. Cutting them out of your life is the absolute 100% correct move given what you and your brother went through.

I am still shocked that such things happen in this world!"
TrueOffMyChest,fnr8t1g,t3_g3fzyk,1587182151.0,"Well personally, I am a woman who likes shorter men, with a strong personality. If he is short with lots of self confidence, intelligence and style that's just so HOT!

Being tall is overrated, and honestly I just don't find it attractive somehow. It's a personal choice, no offence to anybody who is tall of course.

So yes, not all women want tall guys.
And short can be VERY VERY sexy too."
TrueOffMyChest,fnr88cf,t3_g3eauo,1587181733.0,"This is so unfortunate.
Can't imagine how tough this has been for you.

But please, do consider therapy. A good therapist can genuinely help you, and you do deserve a good life. It's really worth it.

Don't overthink this going to the therapist bit, just book a session and go ahead. Therapists have seen it all, heard it and and treated it all, if not much worse. So you know, you won't be judged."
vaginismus,fk03e90,t3_ff92fi,1583739917.0,"I did it today!! Wohooo!

So in between getting 'into the mood' and just before the action, when he said he wanted to slip on the condom, i took a very very quick break, inserted the dialators very quick (have been practicing for 4 years) and went back to him.

And then, he went in!

It wasn't very comformatble, but only slightly painful since we were using lots of lubricant. 


We will be doing it again in a few hours!"
