I’ve worked in country clubs and retail/restaurants in the past and it’s ALWAYS the same thing: boomers are EXTREMELY entitled, don’t say thank you, snap their fingers, belittle, yell and curse if you’re not waiting on them hand and foot and never say thank you. Teenagers are just immature, their brain is literally not fully formed yet. The worst experience I’ve had is that they don’t have enough cash to pay the bill and the make a mess but at least they don’t make you feel like a worthless piece of shit because of your profession. That’s just my experience. I agree with you OP"
