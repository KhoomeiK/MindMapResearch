I was always freezing (sometimes painfully so, and I would literally cry as I ran my hands under hot water), always dizzy, bones hurt, yes.  Somehow though despite being so ill, I managed to work full time on my feet all day as a waitress.  I think when you're so ill, you gradually delude yourself into thinking it's normal, and somehow you power through it.  Well you can, but only for so long...I eventually ended up being medically hospitalized many times (in addition to going to treatment many times) for abnormal EKGs, critically low potassium, lots of other electrolyte issues as well.

Basically you feel like absolute shit, but you forget what it's like to feel normal, so you think feeling like shit IS normal.  I remember the first time I was in treatment, after a few weeks or so I started reading a book and had a revelation like ""wow!  I can read again!  My brain works again!"" and it felt so exciting.  You don't really realize how awful existence is/was until you start working on your behaviors, working on your issues, and gaining weight (when necessary).

It's a therapeutic technique focusing on distress tolerance, basically learning how to cope with and ride out intense emotions without engaging in self destructive or other risky behaviors.

I do vividly remember the white ruffled comforter I laid in bed all day with, but that's about it.  I was in a treatment facility for other issues at the time, so the doctors pulled me into a room.  After they asked me questions, I told them that I heard a screaming voice, and I thought that cameras were watching me.  I didn't have the cognition to know that what I was experiencing wasn't real before that which is why I didn't ask for help at the time.  They switched my diagnosis from bipolar to schizoaffective after that."
bipolar,fnrseug,t3_g3hi1f,1587199783.0,"I never feel guilty about crying.  I think crying is healthy.  It's a healthy and normal release of emotions.  Nothing wrong with crying.  If you're crying because you're experiencing a bad mood state, I think it's worth talking to someone about the mood state, but in the meantime while you're working on getting through the underlying cause crying is a normal and healthy release."
bipolar,fnrra2u,t3_g3gu64,1587198586.0,"When I'm in a normal mood state, I have a crazy high tolerance for caffeine.  Right now I'm averaging 6 cups a day just to stay awake and feel normal (which I know is bad).  When I'm manic though, just 1 cup can push me way over the edge into TOO MUCH ENERGY CRAWLING OUT OF MY SKIN SOS MAKE IT STOP AHHHHHHH."
bipolar,fnrqufl,t3_g3ia76,1587198133.0,This is so cool!  Especially for someone who has never painted before.  Great work!
bipolar,fnrqqxs,t3_g3k0iv,1587198031.0,"I had a neuropsychiatric evaluation to confirm my diagnosis.  afaik you cannot request one yourself, but a treatment professional needs to request one for you, and I was told that they are kind of hard to get to get booked.  It's a very very very long and extensive set of testing.  It took 9ish hours if I'm remembering correctly.

Other than that I've also seen specialist doctors.  I was in a psych ward specifically for bipolar and psychotic disorders, and worked a lot with a doctor there.  I trusted their conclusion because they were an expert in that field."
bipolar,fnrq90j,t3_g2wgx3,1587197522.0,"I was diagnosed at 20, then switched to schizoaffective bipolar at 21.  I was in a residential treatment facility for other things.  I was diagnosed based on the doctors and therapists observations of me."
bipolar,fnrq3md,t3_g382zx,1587197368.0,"I have an ESA cat which is very different than a trained psychiatric service animal.  But with an ESA, he helps me take care of myself.  I know that I need to keep myself healthy and alive because he is literally fully dependent on me.  He motivates me take my medications, abstain from self-destructive behaviors, etc.  I know that if I'm not properly taking care of myself, I can't properly take care of him, and my cat deserves the best care."
bipolar,fnrcihq,t3_g3bmhp,1587184955.0,"I have experienced similar, but I'm not sure it's a bipolar thing for me.  Sexuality is fluid for a lot of people.  Sometimes I'm more attracted to men, sometimes I'm only into women.  I don't notice a correlation with my moods.  It's normal and ok for sexuality to fluctuate."
bipolar,fnjmu31,t3_g22dse,1587002307.0,"Honestly I feel like you're both a bit wrong.  You shouldn't be seeing your boyfriend.  They shouldn't be having anyone over either, even if they're family.  I do understand that it's hypocritical for them to call you out when they're engaging in similar behavior though, and that must feel frustrating."
bipolar,fniy7sd,t3_g1ugsl,1586988489.0,"I took it for eating disorder stuff/binging and purging.  It didn't do anything for that, nor for mood.  I felt REALLY DUMB on it though.  When I got off of it, I felt like a cloud was lifted from my cognition.  It has the nickname dope-a-max fwiw."
bipolar,fnixocz,t3_g1ym5e,1586988204.0,"I definitely developed a tolerance to adderall because I took it every day.  The pharmacy was often out of stock and I would have to wait for refills, and I could barely function those days without it tbh.  I'd definitely recommend taking days off to avoid that (but consult your doctor first to make sure they're ok with you doing that).

I take concerta now instead of adderall, and I feel like there's less physical dependency potential with it.  I can easily go days without concerta fwiw whereas I struggled doing that with adderall."
schizoaffective,fniwm09,t3_g209ll,1586987659.0,"They sell mouthwash that treats dry mouth.  You should be able to find it at any drugstore.  I use it, and it helps.  Listerine is pretty drying because of the alcohol, so tbh I would stop that and switch to a dry mouth formula.  If it's really bad, there are prescription medications intended for dry mouth.  I had sores on my gums from dry mouth, so my dentist prescribed me a medication for it called evoxac."
CatAdvice,fnhzzde,t1_fnge4g5,1586971663.0,"I do put it away at night, but I also do live in the worlds thinnest building haha.  I'll check out the tower though, thank you."
bipolar,fnfmlez,t3_g1hdrg,1586911061.0,I think it's gross that people romanticize mania like this.  Mania is not cool or quirky or attractive.  Mania is severe and scarring and debilitating and all kinds of horrible.  Things like the manic pixie dream girl bullshit make a joke out of the serious ways mania and this illness have impacted and forever altered me.  The manic pixie dream girl thing enrages me.
bipolar,fnfgcaq,t3_g16gzh,1586907518.0,"For me it doesn't matter.  I describe my symptoms to my treatment professionals as I experience them, and they treat me however they feel is appropriate.  I feel like diagnoses are mostly for insurance companies.  Symptoms and how they affect me are what matter most."
schizoaffective,fnfdfra,t3_g0j1fa,1586905961.0,"I thought this for a long time, and I learned to be content being alone.  Then I happened to find someone who fully accepts me, and now we are married.  It's ok to be alone, and it's ok to be in a relationship, but either way I think everyone could benefit from learning to be content with solitude...that goes for everyone, mentally ill people and neurotypical people.

I don't think it's selfish for mentally ill people to be in relationships, but I do think that once you are committed to another person, you owe it to them to do your best to manage your mental health.  Obviously mental health is never fully in our control, but I now regularly take my medications and am proactive about talking to my doctor because I feel like I owe at least that to my partner."
schizoaffective,fnfcr2p,t3_g1ckpd,1586905596.0,IME first generation antipsychotics generally work more quickly.  I've taken both haldol and trilafon for this.  Saphris is also supposed to be fairly fast acting.
bipolar,fnfcaja,t3_g0sbkx,1586905354.0,I used to love going for walks.  When manic sometimes on my walks I'd just start RUNNING down the street as fast as I could because walking seemed too slow lol.
bipolar,fnfc4w9,t3_g0zaa5,1586905271.0,"During one manic episode I was very spiritual.  I didn't adhere to any organized religion, but I was really into spirituality generally.  Think universe, energy, crystals, that kind of stuff.  I regularly heard music that I thought was coming from another dimension (now I know that was psychosis)."

bipolar,fnfbd0w,t3_g16c24,1586904862.0,"I have nexplanon which is not an IUD, but has similar hormones to hormonal IUDs.  I've heard different things from different doctors about med interactions.  Some say it's more of a thing with birth control pills, some say there's still risk of reduced efficacy with implants/IUDs.  I don't know who is right, but I'm really paranoid about it because I definitely don't want to be pregnant, so I use condoms in addition to the implant.  I'm thinking of trying a copper IUD next because it is non-hormonal so meds do not reduce its efficacy."
birthcontrol,fnf8n9o,t3_g17vmx,1586903434.0,"Yep.  For the first year or so that I had nexplanon, I had very light or no periods.  Now into my second year of having it, I've been getting heavier and longer than normal periods.  I saw an OBGYN about it, and they said that it was normal with nexplanon."
birthcontrol,fnf8ga9,t3_g1cndk,1586903333.0,"I really like mine.  I have a lot of friends who had no period on it, but I'm one of the unlucky weird ones who has longer and heavier periods on it.  Other than that, I don't have any side effects.  Even with the longer and heavier periods, I still think it's worth it.  I like having a birth control option that I never have to think about.  I've had it for about two years now."
bipolar,fnf7jga,t3_g10em4,1586902852.0,I guess a vape because I've used it to help quit cigarettes.  Otherwise I usually just buy clothing and other useless junk.
bipolar,fn74a0y,t3_g005zf,1586713005.0,"Trileptal can sometimes cause hyponatremia (low sodium).  Confusion can be a symptom of that.  Do you feel any other symptoms of hyponatremia like fatigue, dizziness, or muscle cramps?  Hyponatremia can be dangerous, so I'd definitely bring this up with your doctor asap, especially if you're having other symptoms of it."
