I saw the season 4 ending and damn I did not remember it was that horrible. I swear I had an anxiety attack when I saw that scene in episode 12 🥺 and the ending with Daya pointing the gun and Poussey staring into my soul at the end. I don’t know why but it didn’t hit me like this before. I’ve been crying over for Poussey the past 3 days"

jeffreestarcosmetics,fn3md9x,t1_fn3lncc,1586623617.0,Thanks! I will try to do that! Also never tried them as an eyeshadow base so that should be interesting! I only own Deceased and Celebrity skin as VLL but I’ve used them as eyeshadow before and they work amazing! Also tried them as liners and they’re great! I see what I can do with the lip ammos ❣️

BullTerrier,fmc7blg,t1_fmbphzz,1585940252.0,His breath smelled somewhat like urine. I don’t know about the banana smell thing but if you think something’s off with his breath and that it doesn’t smell like it always did you should definitely take him for a vet check just to be sure♥️

BullTerrier,fm8zyue,t1_fm8x07v,1585859131.0,"Well, he’s always had a sensitive stomach. So when he eats something that makes him vomit, I usually give him a few drops of domperidone and make sure that the next thing he eats is not too heavy for his stomach, for example rice and chicken. And after that he’s completely fine. So that happened and I just thought meh maybe he sneaked into the cats room and ate some of their food( we have 5 cats ) so I gave him the domperidone and then rice and chicken but he vomited again and that NEVER happened before. He always feels better after that. So I took him to the vet and she smelled his breath and told me something was off. So she ran a few tests and found out he had Leptospirosis and that it was affecting his kidneys because his urea and creatinine levels were too high. So he got fluid therapy for his kidneys for a few days and then he was put on antibiotics to kill the lepto. 
He started to get better and then he started to throw up again so he’s back on the fluid therapy. And he’s getting better now but maybe the damage caused on his kidneys will be permanent :( 

So long story short, I knew something was wrong when he vomited rice and chicken lol"
jeffreestarcosmetics,fm4l0yg,t3_fsya1d,1585756110.0,That’s so pretty! You’re so talented! I’ve never tried a glitter liner before so I may attempt it today ❣️

BullTerrier,fjkqymp,t1_fjknb7f,1583432160.0,He’s actually vaccinated against that and he still somehow got it:( but here where I live there has been many cases of that so I guess that’s why and it’s really contagious so yeah I hope he gets better ! He’s responding well to treatment and he’s very energetic and doesn’t look sick at all so I hope his kidneys don’t get worse!
Petloss,fjk36tt,t3_fdu6rh,1583419001.0,I’m so sorry for your loss! Just reading that made me tear up as well. When you described that scent I know just what you’re talking about. My dog kinda smells like popcorn (lol) when he’s not dirty or freshly cleaned. And he sleeps on my bed so everything smells like popcorn in my room. I can imagine myself going through that same thing when he’s not around anymore 🥺

bipolar,fj9pm7x,t1_fj8uo15,1583156297.0,She said I was fine and that I should continue taking the same dosage so I went to another psychiatrist to have a second opinion and she added Lamictal.

I also used to ride horses. And I have a mostly vegan lifestyle ( I don’t buy products with animal ingredients, clothing, cosmetics and so on, but I’ve been so depressed lately and I haven’t had the energy to cook and stuff like that so I just eat whatever my family eats (which mostly contains meat). I was looking up why I am so sensitive one day and I found about highly sensitive people (HSP) and of course you could be HSP and bipolar"

VeganBeauty,fh5oi1t,t1_fh599dy,1581290917.0,"Thank you so much! I have an elf palette but I don’t really like the quality of it. I was really excited about the colours but when I tried it they were all patchy or too dusty. I think elf is great but just not the eyeshadows. I like the Milani ones but I feel like I need a palette with more colours on it. That Lime crime one looks great ! I haven’t seen that one before I think I maybe should give it a try ! Also wish it had more shadows but it looks great anyways. I will look up some reviews and see if I can get it ! I don’t think all of colourpop eyeshadows are vegan though and I never heard of makeup geek so I might give it a look! 
Thank you so much 🖤🖤🖤"
