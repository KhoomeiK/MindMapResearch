I had that done to me once. They used my perfectionism to avoid bad things against me and criticized me constantly and in a team project... these were the profs by the way, which made it unstable on purpose.

Then I noticed and threw it back in their face. I just ended up saying no to everything and since they didn‚Äôt have their own proper documentation for their own rubrics (yeah, they invented bullshit).... normies ate up their bullshit hard - they loved it and kept thinking in their frame of mind.

My therapist when I picked up one during since I was devastated since growing up teachers were my surrogate parents as my parents had zero emotional interest or care for me. My therapist didn‚Äôt believe me at first but then when it finished and I became ‚Äúok again‚Äù he said it was like night and day.

This was in an undergrad. They were honestly sick bastards for it.

My motivation is now very intrinsic because my own parents never cared for me anyways and would put down me when I did well because my Dad was a narc and my mom was a drinking, druggie  enabling adulterous. I kept wanting it but every time I did, they pushed me away. Rarely did a teacher pick up that and motivate through positive reinforcement because I felt love from them (platonic) and that they did care about me.

I don‚Äôt know exactly what motivates me anymore. I know for sure staying away from my abusive parents is a main one, but getting me to understand that work can be mad, but it‚Äôs not like my parents (sometimes in other places it was and I was very depressed and got sick all the time - couldn‚Äôt move and leave my bed, constantly on back pain medication)."

Finding the right match has always been my priority first before the money because if I‚Äôm making all the money but the manager or work is honestly awful, it‚Äôs more stress than it‚Äôs worth. I look for partners and supports to execute and to help if something goes sideways higher up or politically as required.

I usually get help with buffering at work as I can feel issues miles away with people or if something is unstable. As long as I have one person to talk to in my chain of management, I can execute it. If I have zero support I feel like it‚Äôs not worth the dollars they are paying me as I consider them built into the pricing :)

I‚Äôm good with other support people, but I‚Äôm a developer by trade and good at trying to understand what‚Äôs up or what feels bad. I‚Äôm sensitive and I grew up a scapegoat so I suppose this is a gift too.

I was just given an extra responsibility tied to this sort of thing and I worked on in my job of sticking to my guns, but helping instead of running away. My NDad was physically intimidating and a bully growing up and he had to always be right... arrogance is apparently not welcome where I work so I‚Äôve been doing a lot better.

Finding the right environment or creating it was key to my improvement."

n64,fq7vk7b,t1_fq6yyme,1589153093.0,I have an extra copy of Goldeneye except I don‚Äôt know how I got it. I‚Äôm up in Canada though. My spouse has been bugging me to sell that and my 2017 I unupdated Switch.
n64,fq7vf3n,t1_fq6lx7u,1589153009.0,I would die if I got Superman 64 so I could experience the awfulness of the rings constantly. I almost bought it twice for $5. üòÇ
n64,fq7vazv,t1_fq6mdi5,1589152941.0,Wow. Nice leg work and you got the rewards on the work. :) Great work!
Showerthoughts,fq7n681,t1_fq7fdht,1589148637.0,"Well, honestly, for me to understand your position I would have to be smoking some weed to open the mind a bit to see what you are seeing, because quite frankly, I don‚Äôt."
TheSimpsons,fq7eo50,t1_fq6nc3o,1589145405.0,"Oh yeah, I tell people to spend their money to see Paul. Saw him twice where I‚Äôm from the both times he was here. The first time I spent a small fortune on a sweet ticket. Regret not getting sound check but I was a broke student at the time, but it was still a wonderful place to watch from. Nothing will beat it. Things will come close, but that night felt like something else. Great energy in those crowds."
Showerthoughts,fq7b3gk,t1_fq781wl,1589144096.0,"It‚Äôs just honestly I haven‚Äôt heard of that opinion before, personal preference or not and I‚Äôve spoken to a lot of people on this topic."
Showerthoughts,fq76a1t,t1_fq5w5jr,1589142340.0,"Sorry, but there‚Äôs a ton of people that feel different that I know of. I don‚Äôt know about you but I haven‚Äôt heard this comment about him from anyone else.

That and the harmonies. You must be on something. You must be butt hurt still from the band or something breaking up. Yeesh."

Sorry, had to do it. But yeah, really? They put conspiracies in there?"
Showerthoughts,fq37od6,t1_fq1wu1e,1589063779.0,He's known for his awesome voice so idk what you're talking about. Nasally? I'm not sure I follow you?
AskReddit,fq1h8qr,t1_fq0f6wq,1589045633.0,It‚Äôs sad that I understand this. I hope you are away from that person.
AskReddit,fq1gum8,t1_fpzyl3g,1589045531.0,Sure my parents emotional abuse that really happened and the physical assaults were all in my mind. Got it.
AskReddit,fq1gdfw,t1_fq01xvw,1589045408.0,Fucking same. Jokes on them that I‚Äôm in therapy and the therapist believes I grew up being abused. Cool.
datingoverthirty,fq1fx6r,t3_gghy74,1589045294.0,"He seems like he is an abuser since he want back to using and is gaslighting your with the jewelry - I would sell it. I would move on and don‚Äôt look back.

I hope things improve for you!"

smallboobproblems,fq1e9f9,t1_fq0z1yn,1589044863.0,"Oh, I get the math, trust me, but it feels like shit and floats there. I recommend no one to do two sizes up in the band if they‚Äôre smaller. I feel sized out because it doesn‚Äôt really fit well at all and sister sizing if it‚Äôs two sizes is honestly just awful. I won‚Äôt buy 32A period.

Oh yeah, I agree with you about the no feet, no shoes then comment. It‚Äôs not no feet, it‚Äôs small feet and small feet still need shoes."
maninthehighcastle,fq0xgoa,t3_gg3lvp,1589038837.0,He also seemed to not age.
