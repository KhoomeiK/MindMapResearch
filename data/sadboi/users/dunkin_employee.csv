What do you think leads to more arrests ? is it the higher volume of calls ? or racist cops ? because i am 100% sure that some people are working as cops and are racist, but its the minority of cops, not the majority.

workout,fpw6cvi,t1_fpw2z43,1588958032.0,"Ok, i have a few things to talk about here, i want to start by defining what i mean when i say the problem is the culture, statistically black people commit crimes at a higher rate than all other races, im not saying ""They were taught since they were kids to go commit crimes"" is the cause, the cause is the way they were treated in the past, and families were seperated, this was the beginning of the rise of single parent households (usually mothers), and over the years, it increased to its current 80%, if you were raised in a single parent household, the chances of you succeeding in life are much lower, and sometimes the desperation causes you to result to crimes to make a living.

i just wanted to clear that out, explain what i mean by culture,  can you explain more about how standardized testing is racist ? I am middle eastern and moved to the us 5 years ago (getting my citizenship this year, yayyy) and we use the same testing methods in the middle east that we use here, i also lived in nigeria for about a year, and although i didnt go to school there, i made friends that did, and they use the same testing methods we do in the middle east as well, so thats at least 3 different countries each on a different continent that use the same testing methods, either i dont understand what you mean by standardized testing, or its usage is farely global, if so, how is it racist ?

I cannot comment on fraternities or sororities as i have no information on them at all.

something like affirmative action, i would agree is sytemically racist for example."
