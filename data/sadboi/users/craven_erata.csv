NoStupidQuestions,fqs7wvf,t3_gknsbx,1589600536.0,"I get the logic, but fat doesn’t help with anything it just puts strain on what you have. When people have large muscles, it’s not just the muscles that are built but the whole support system. The heart and lungs are more efficient so that you can use the strength you have, They are stronger then a skinny person but can’t use the strength long term, and it’s countered by the extra weight they need to move when using the strength. 
For example, very simply my muscles I can lift 5kg and yours can lift 10kg, but you have 3kg to lift yourself up so at best you can lift 7kg
