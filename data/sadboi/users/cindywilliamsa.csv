woocommerce,fmkq82z,t3_fomxxl,1586164336.0,"There may be a plethora of themes in [WordPress development](https://virtina.com/wordpress-development) or WooCommerce, but ultimately there aren’t too many that sync with your business. That is why you need to narrow down to the best few that are compatible with your brand. So, here’s all the indispensable attributes that need to be checked before picking an excellent [WooCommerce](https://virtina.com/platforms/woocommerce-development-services) theme.

• Features – All the essential features you can’t do without, that must at all costs figure within the theme. Ensure you have a design/framework in mind before you start browsing.

• Responsiveness – Make sure your site is easy to use on multiple devices. In which case, it’ll have easy to navigate menus, widgets, a fluid site grid & flexible images in sync with mobile

• Frequent Updates – It’s essential to have a theme that gets its periodic support & releases. This keeps your theme from going out-dated.

• Reviews – Look for reviews/ratings – this gives the best insight into the quality of the theme.

• Product Pages – PDP is where all the decisions are made. Ideally, a PDP should feature product variants, reviews, descriptions, related products, images, social media & more.

• Breadcrumbs – Lookout for themes that leave a trail and then allow users to jump back and forth with ease.

Beyond all these, you’d want compatibility with browsers, blogging, design support through WordPress customizer, good page speeds, attractive colors, branded & customizable shopping cart."
woocommerce,fljd4ho,t3_fghaxu,1585207482.0,"On the surface level, it may seem like Shopify is the clear winner. After all, for Shopify, the price ranges from $29 to $299 per month. If you could run a store for as less as $29, without worrying about SSL, domain & hosting, then it’s a very cost-effective package.

But, that is not the case, as many stores run into add-ons, modules, extensions, and other API costs. Due to which, the initial price won’t cut it, and you’d end up spending more on themes and other upgrades. Plus, to expand the store’s functionalities, you will have to pay over and above $29.

[WooCommerce experts](https://virtina.com/hire-woocommerce-developer) may come with extra costs for hosting, domain & security. But, that included plus the ability to expand with the numerous plugins still gives the edge to WooCommerce. The open nature allows you to integrate practically anything & scale the store.

The same on Shopify will cost a ton. Also, Shopify charges 2% per transaction fees if you use a 3rd Party payment Gateway, and the only way to get rid of it is by using Shopify Payments. On WooCommerce, this is not the case, but bank charges & payment provider charges will apply.

Using Stripe, PayPal, Square, etc. will incur integration charges on WooCommerce. [Shopify integration services](https://virtina.com/shopify-integration) end up with another 2% charge (Basic Shopify) on every transaction. A 2% extra is a hefty amount, especially if you are running a small business."

The form of the business venture will determine how it's organized and it has an effect on the way you report your income. There are four different forms of business ownership. It includes sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, and cooperative. Each has distinct characteristics. [Registering a sole proprietorship](https://www.ontariobusinesscentral.ca/sole-proprietorship.php) is very easy and affordable than registering a corporation. In a partnership business, instead of one proprietor, there are two or more. I think the partnership business is best for you. Both partners contribute cash, labor, property, and skills. Even a verbal agreement is enough to form a partnership business. You must remember that either partner can be held responsible for business debts and liabilities brought by the other one.

depression,fbwywqu,t3_edpkii,1577163335.0,"Yes!!! Anger can be considered as a possible symptom of depression. Short-term anger is the usual scenario. But, long-term anger must be avoided. I struggled on into my early twenties with feelings of anger and depression. I used Clonazepam and Xanax to cover up the symptoms for many years but the anxiety simply returned if I  didn't use it. Later, I consulted a psychiatrist who is specialized in such disorders. I was experiencing depression, and the doctor prescribed medication. But these incidences of high depression and anxiety resulted in vestibular diseases and more symptoms of dizziness. Now, I'm planning to conduct a detailed diagnostic procedure consisting of clinical and neurological examinations.

Locksmith,fbn8rqn,t3_e04peo,1576994260.0,"I think rekeying a car door lock is something you can do yourself with the proper tools. Most car owners like you - Mr. Garbus - leave it to be done by locksmith service providers. The best thing about choosing professional [locksmith service providers](https://protectionplus.ca/residential/locksmith-services) is that they have a vast amount of knowledge in the subject. I used to do that previously. The truth is most people don’t know that with the right tools and a little tolerance, rekeying car door locks is an easy task.

First, you should set up the following things:

1. Rekeying kit available on [Google Shopping Site](https://www.google.com/shopping/product/7840773995072415847). It must contain a catch tool, a spanner, a plastic follower tube etc.
2. Set of lock pins and screwdriver.
3. Cylinder follower and plug follower.
4. Hand tools including pliers.

Next, you should remove the lock from your car. The doorknob is held in place by a single clip. To reach the clip, you must insert a wire into a tiny opening to access the interior of the lock. The cylinder follower helps in removing the lock cylinder. After you finished removing all pins, unplug the key. Then insert the new lock key onto the cylinder. Don't forget to lubricate the lock after replacing the pins. Please try this and let me know!"
deaf,f7b4b6b,t3_dodyye,1573555026.0,"More than one-third of people over 60 years of age are affected by hearing loss. It is estimated that by 2050 over 900 million people will have a hearing impairment. Many young people don't realize that hearing loss is permanent. Chronic exposure to loud noise kills sensitive inner-ear cells. The hearing loss can be associated with depression. I'm just 28 and hearing loss forces me to avoid social situations rather than dealing it with the weariness of straining to hear. I'd rather skip night parties and team outings. The hearing impairment makes me feel anxious at work as well. I feel embarrassed and awkward while talking to strangers. Recently, I went to [Hearing Solutions](https://hearingsolutions.ca/locations/lawrence-plaza) located at Bathurst Street and Lawrence Avenue West area, close to Shoppers Drug Mart in Toronto.

I know that if I'm leaving my health unchecked it can lead to severe damage of my body. My weight has increased recently. I guess high tension has caused this inflammation and consequently some pelvic disorders. At first, I planned to consult our family doctor so that I can get some stress-relieving tablets.

A healthy pelvic floor is crucial for both bowel and bladder continence. My friend suggested a few pelvic floor physiotherapists at [Physio Active](https://www.physioactive.ca/our-services/womens-pelvic-health) who are dedicated to providing female patients with outstanding professional care. They are also offering treatment for sports-related injuries and disc herniations. Robyn Cornofsky was my physiotherapist there. She is also experienced in outpatient orthopaedic and sports medicine. Her professional style involves gaining any person’s confidence and trust. I went to their clinic at the northeast corner of Dufferin & Clark in Thornhill."

Proper precautions must be taken at the beginning to prevent many problems. A high-quality home security camera system is one of the easiest ways to deter criminals from breaking into a home.

How much are you willing to invest in this? And how much coverage and types of features you need? I prefer installing security films for windows in this case.
