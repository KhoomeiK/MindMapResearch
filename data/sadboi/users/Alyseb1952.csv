Okay now let me think logically...granted, he was not going to ever testify. However, once the documents were “released “ to the media, he knew that he would either get out and be killed, or would serve up to 45 years. 

This is all speculation and my opinion.

I believe he said “Yeah no, goodbye!” But, wasn’t he on suicide watch? He committed suicide...while being on suicide watch...I’ll let everyone else insert their own jokes and thoughts here.

Edit: No really, I do want to know what you all think? After reading some comments, I completely get why people are saying he was assisted with this “suicide”. it wouldn’t surprise me if this wasn’t a suicide to begin with. But sure, let’s just say it was. Because, you know, NOBODY, would question it. It doesn’t even matter, the truth will never die.
