I always felt better after flipping out and it helped me to calm down for a while so I could recenter and gather my thoughts. After a while, it became second nature to try and retreat before I lost my mind, as opposed to after. Like I subconsciously got tired of hurting the people I care about and the apologizing. I still do it from time to time, but I’ve gotten better about at least stewing by myself and keeping silent, so I’m not unreasonably attacking anyone. If it’s too much for me, I’ll wait until the next day and usually a night of rest resets me and I can think clearly about what happened the next day."

BorderlinePDisorder,fbiip9s,t3_edg1oa,1576902180.0,"I am 26(F) years old and I was diagnosed a few years after my twins were born. I was a tornado of chaotic toxicity- here one minute and gone the next and I exploded at the slightest provocation. My postpartum depression didn’t do any help either of course. I spent weeks in mental health centers, jail, and rehabs due to the spiraling out-of-control circumstances. I gave my mom guardianship of the twins in 2014 (they were 3) after finally realizing that I wasn’t capable. She has been a godsend for them, they have stability and consistency and they are flourishing. It is now 2019 and I have just moved back to be with all of them, though I always texted/called/FaceTimed/visited. I’m so much better now, having spent those years recovering from the trauma. I still struggle from time to time but it’s easier for me to handle to struggles that come with being a parent on top of day to day life. Every situation is different as well as every person. In my case, the situation was extremely poor and dire so these were the circumstances I resorted to. You do what you need to, and work on healing. At the end of the day, I did what was best for my kids despite the fact that I felt like a complete failure. And they were 100000 times better for it, I do not doubt that."

BorderlinePDisorder,f25r4lq,t3_dbx7ga,1569981633.0,"My advice is to take it one moment at a time. Try not to focus on the future and “getting better”. It’s only going to frustrate you more when you don’t see results. That will come with time. Focus instead on the moments of the day, I know it’s hard. I’ve spent the last 15 years dealing with MDD, PTSD, and BPD, it’s one hell of a rollercoaster. Between the trauma and the mood swings and the extreme turmoil inside my head, I felt like I was always going to want to die and be erased from this existence. Today I haven’t had a suicidal thought in about a month and a half! For sure I relapse from time to time, but what can I really expect, it’s a chemical imbalance and that can’t be fixed overnight. My bad thoughts are few and far apart now and if you would’ve told me 5 years ago I wouldn’t wanna die every day I’d laugh at you with such cynicism is my voice. Each moment that I’m able to redirect the turmoil is a victory. Each moment that my mood swings wildly out of control and I lash out, but come back and talk it out is a victory. It may take me awhile but lately I’ve had more victories as opposed to blow ups and I take pride in that! We aren’t perfect, we are not meant to be perfect and that’s okay. Just try and focus on the little moments and one day you’ll make it there."

BPD,exjjjcp,t3_ct3zz3,1566352041.0,"My advice is to find friends who give a hoot about your mental health. Out of the 1,000 people I've met in the last 6 years, only 3 have really stuck by my side. They are three people who have no idea what BPD is or how far it tests the limits. But they are three people who listen and are there for me when I need them, no matter what. It's not an easy thing for me to make friends and it's even harder to keep them, especially when I feel like pushing the world out.  I have friends who are there when I need them and they understand that I'm not always going to be 100%. It's so hard but you have to try and push yourself a little every day. When I'm having my socialization droughts (where I don't want to communicate with everyone) , I push myself at least once a week to let someone I care about know that ""I miss you but I'm having trouble"" or , ""I miss/love you very much but I'm not feeling social right now"". SOMETHING! You don't have to explain 24/7 you just have to put forth that tiny bit of impossible effort every now and then."
