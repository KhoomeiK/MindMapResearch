ptsd,flnm4of,t1_flm3wd8,1585321461.0,"It's a hard cycle to break for the abuser or the abused. 

I have to live with myself and the memories of the things I've done, and the life I lost because of it. And that's no one's fault but my own. 

As long as your abusive exes can't accept the accountability of their actions they'll never begin to break that cycle.

It's not your fault. But if you want to continue to listen to the narrative established by the guys who did this to you, that's up to you. I hope that's not the case though because every day you believe it was your fault, they are still abusing you."
ptsd,flm3ioo,t3_fpfhou,1585273734.0,"I was in an abusive 5ish year relationship with my first. The only difference is I was the abuser. So I can tell you confidently, it's not you or your fault. 

I'd isolate the sort of person your attracted to though. Figure yourself out. Start there."

I only know this because I live in Florida. 

Side note: I think I just realized it's time to move."

When you realize it's building, take 5 deep breaths."

ptsd,fl4o3da,t1_fl1ceje,1584817674.0,Perhaps that's why I let it go.
ptsd,fl4nydf,t1_fl1cwi4,1584817593.0,I'm really glad. Hopefully for the better. Good luck.
ptsd,fl4nbgw,t1_fl1zmtj,1584817225.0,"I wonder, is this truly how everyone lives and we just handle it differently mentally? Do we not adapt as well or do we have more trouble letting go? 

I've heard so much about life, but no one has ever told me it's easy, stable, consistent, or promised."
ptsd,fl4n14v,t1_fl2fvpy,1584817063.0,"I'm surprised by how much I can relate to this reading through the comments. I joined this group because I have trouble myself relating to people who haven't had the same experiences and to me seem naive. And on the other hand, I don't want to surround myself in people who were traumatized either. 

I hang on to everything. I repeat every word and every lost feeling. Don't do that. I don't want to, but I'm 26 now and not as carefree as I was at your age. I held on to the pain and who I was thinking that it was worth something. That I endured it for a reason. I didn't. If I could tell my 18 year old self anything it would be to learn to let it go."

millenials,f8cfb65,t1_f8ceb19,1574459024.0,I haven't seen any of that. Most of my peers including myself spent 6+ years in college to come out either jobless or on the low end of the pay scales.
