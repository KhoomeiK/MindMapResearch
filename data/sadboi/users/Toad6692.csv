relationship_advice,fma9vu9,t1_fm9gkaj,1585887661.0,I actually had and he didn’t seem like the guy I’d want to have a kid with Due to his clingy mildly jealous behavior he already showed so I unfortunately had an abortion which kills me because if it’s been a secret that I was pregnant I would’ve kept the baby and called it quits on him. The felony was from him getting a 16 year old pregnant when he was 23 and she doesn’t want him involved with the kids life . Divorce was because the wife he married for money and not for love fucked his best friend while he was over seas in the navy.
relationship_advice,fma9la2,t1_fm9gdof,1585887433.0,I didn’t want a tldr with the smarter mouthed of our kind . They are male. Scott with a girl who was already pregnant and then went on to have a daughter with her she ended up having sex with his own father. They broke up when her son turn to he now pays child support But doesn’t get to have contact with those kids.  He later had a child with a 16-year-old who. Didn’t tell him her age until she got pregnant he got sent to jail And that’s where his felony came from she doesn’t want contact with him or the kid. Worst example of clingy behavior going through my phone And waiting outside the bathroom every time I go. He divorced a woman he apparently did not love but married for money Because he has sex with his best friend while he was in the Navy. Thank you for asking for context
relationship_advice,fma96lz,t1_fm9gjme,1585887112.0,The first girl was pregnant when they got together then had another kid by them.. went on to have relations with their father she collecting child support from my person who works to provide it though there’s knowledge she doesn’t spend the money on the kids. The other kid was from a 16 year old who told them her age once she got knocked up they went to prison for this which is where the felony came from it eats me alive

antinatalism,fh6jj95,t3_f19uki,1581300027.0,"I suffer from depression and bipolar I could never bring anyone in this already awful world under those genetic pretenses. Never mind what your partner may have . Like wow I pray that with antinatalism becoming more known our species can stop being animals with thumbs and start being human and start doing better for those of us in existence already and not the “future” our species seriously needs global sterilization so we can focus on actually saving the planet , not what’s my baby’s name when am I having kids blah blah. There won’t be a world for the next century at the rate we’re going"
pregnant,ffrfw9z,t1_ffr98lk,1580157276.0,Lmao I look at that too I appreciate that he actually has a heart which is hard to come by . I’m worried we might suffer from it is all but There’s nothing like an I told you so? I guess.
SuicideWatch,f8c0bb7,t1_f5rv7hu,1574449458.0,Thank you for the kind words. I didn’t think anyone would actually read this haha thank you.
socialanxiety,f8bzzq7,t1_f6k0118,1574449239.0,True true it sucks it’s the norm to be connected but gradually I plan to skip off the grid. Do you ever feel overwhelmed by it all?
SuicideWatch,f8bztdd,t1_f5ummhi,1574449121.0,Sorry to hear that . Anyone who’s a human being is going to have it hard no matter what.
SuicideWatch,f8bzpf4,t1_f5uqmp1,1574449048.0,Lol Damn right
socialanxiety,f8bzhjz,t1_f6e6u0h,1574448905.0,I’m glad it helps :) hopefully you can go back to smiling naturally one day. I know it gets hard though. Here in the USA you have to smile to avoid fights even though you’re seen as a freak of sorts in my area for smiling . People suck *pats on back*
raisedbynarcissists,f8bz7mg,t1_f6jbcoh,1574448725.0,Oh my god that’s horrible. Why have kids if that’s how you’re going to do them? My mom will give me smaller portions of everything like I remember being young and waiting thirty minutes after dinner was made because she was comparing everything making sure she had the bigger amount. She made me cry before school once because she was SURE that I got more than her of a bag of French fries I had made. Fuck parents seriously
raisedbynarcissists,f8byx3o,t1_f6m1rqq,1574448534.0,Do you ever get the “are you okay? You’re not doing drugs right?” I LOVE that one. Like leave people the hell alone.
antinatalism,f8bxzts,t3_dztnv2,1574447928.0,I’m so tired of our species making everything baby proof for everyone . People are like me seeks. WE NEED TO DIE! Our species is a psychopath.
antinatalism,f8bxhh3,t3_e04dds,1574447587.0,How is it even considered a congratulatory deal anymore? You’re just a number amongst billions of other humans and things that are all the center of their own universe . Congratulations on bringing another faceless innocent into the void of despair that is life 👏
antinatalism,f6ithrt,t3_dra1gz,1572884118.0,Why? Whhhhyy?
antinatalism,f6itcdo,t3_drilad,1572884050.0,What. Death is better When you’re unaware and truly powerless than foster care when you can feel and be even more powerless.
raisedbynarcissists,f6it56w,t3_drh7gs,1572883960.0,My favorite from my mom was I was getting fat. Lol like I give a damn 👎👍
socialanxiety,f6isxvm,t3_dr31n9,1572883868.0,Lol Zeldamaster05 I should shut that fucker down. It’s getting waaay too crowded on there. Plus I’d rather have my face in a book than on Facebook any day.
socialanxiety,f6e5doo,t3_dr2zz0,1572800368.0,Try smiling with your eyes and a faint smile which will say I’m trying here. Lightly squint your eyes squinting from the bottom lids and feel the corner of your lips curling upward just slightly. I’ve been here with every job it all goes well so long as I’m bouncing around and weeeeee! All the time but when I’m just tired of the facade I’ve been alienated from groups and talked about and even provoked. You can’t be all smiley because some people are a holes and you can’t be down because are a holes.
socialanxiety,f6e4mil,t3_dr1rig,1572800142.0,"27 years old here and You know what I’m in the same boat. If you have to gather your thoughts and be alone tell them and they’ll either be with you or against you. If they delete you from FB Fuck em. If they hate you instead of love you and listen to the words coming from your mouth fuck em. If they CHOOSE NOT TO UNDERSTAND (because people have the attention span of a fly and are just as persistent to get what they want) fuck em. This worlds waaaaay too populated to be concerned with such close minded groups. If you tell them that you’d be no good for this occasion but still have to engage, tell them flat out that you’ll arrive to just say hi and go. Lie and say you have stuff to do afterward so you can’t stay long. Good luck 🍀"
antinatalism,f60d2av,t3_dpzlr3,1572613917.0,I feel bad for everyone and everything. The struggle is the whole point of life and the counter thinkers are the assholes.
raisedbynarcissists,f60cbsa,t3_dpxoa2,1572613286.0,Yes. And if you aren’t a full blown adult (24-up) yet the constant barrage from the world may make it worse. Almost to the point you feel like you’re inside out you’ve imploded so much into yourself to hide any good part that’s capable of being hurt. And it is possible to completely turn yourself off doing at will is skill to be learned. Best wishes
raisedbynarcissists,f60bycv,t3_dpzeqc,1572612961.0,Oh wow geez I have to admit I do the same thing but I make sure I’m alone if I’m not I try to mutter. Like if I’m angry I just go off . This is eerily familiar.. she may be schizophrenic. Maybe ease her into getting some sort of medication she may be a shitheel but she doesn’t need to be a scary shitheel. Don’t be surprised if she’s too n to admit this issue  or manage it though best of luck!
raisedbynarcissists,f60b2pf,t3_dpzgda,1572612173.0,Hey there I’m from the antinatalist group feel free to head on over and join us 👋 If any parent loves their child they will not bring them into this world to suffer.
SuicideWatch,f5twv1r,t3_dpa6nr,1572465419.0,Hey hey just be you. It really won’t matter 200 years from now. You are who you are. And think of it this way.. you could’ve been actually born female and I’ll tell you something trans men Have more rights than women do any day of the week. Women are the doormat of the world my friend and maybe that’s why people still don’t accept trans men because who ACTUALLY WANTS TO BE A WOMAN? Our lives suck 🤗
SuicideWatch,f5twblo,t3_dpa567,1572465210.0,Who remembers that guy from 200 years ago who was the greatest person and went to work religiously etc etc? No one? That’s what I thought.
antisocial,f5tw4x0,t3_dp12xk,1572465136.0,"It’s actually quite liberating to just clam up when people ask what’s wrong. And seriously don’t worry about the unfriending and all that crap. Take it from me. I’m 27 and I’m just now breaking free of all that “woo!” Crap and just being like it is. Introverts and antisocials are a thing just like being lgbt, extroverted, what have you. You have just as reason to exist as do people who choose to have 19 kids and counting."
SuicideWatch,f5rsigi,t3_dop33k,1572401926.0,"They’ll be the first ones to say “why didn’t they talk to meeee???” “I would’ve been there” boo hoos go to them so they can feel better about their shitty half ass attempts at giving a damn. I can’t stand people.

Edit: oooor those folk that you try to open up to and they either interrupt you, get “distracted” because they’re dumb flighty sheople, or don’t even bother to reply because it ultimately “has nothing to do with them.“"
SuicideWatch,f5rq6v9,t3_dkfkaq,1572400336.0,I hate my life. No THIS KIND of life. Having to pretend. Having to do and be everything at once at make people proud. Trying to be normal when it’s never been. Knowing I’m just a space occupier for everyone I know and if/when I go through with it they’ll all be the first ones to say “they could’ve talked to me!” When damn well it’s known I couldn’t because if you’re not spewing sheople none sense your flapping mouth goes unnoticed and so does your seething sadness and anger. Feeling tormented each day waking up knowing yeah it could be worse but if it’s worse and you live through it then your life is valid unlike this current one because no one takes anything seriously. Everything has to be a joke less you upset the crowd. It’s maddening at points.  Pain is relevant and for those who find comfort in deaths arms like tryst between lovers I wonder how long I can wait for the inevitable. It becomes scary and then it becomes warm and welcoming. There’s so much to live for but what slice of that 5% are we eligible for?
antinatalism,f5rnpcz,t3_dont6o,1572398645.0,What? You mean there are people who hate being alive for all the right reasons?? Gasp better put us all in a psych ward right? How dare anyone be ungrateful for this wonderful life. I can’t stand “Optimistic”people They’ll never fool anyone. They can smile but it doesn’t hide the truth. Not for a second.
antinatalism,f5rnehl,t3_doyoqt,1572398435.0,It’s all about that little power trip our species likes to push onto others. I like hearing people whine I want another baby ! Isn’t the one or more you have enough suffering for a life time? Or do we still need to replace ourselves because we’re all so special and lovely? I can’t stand our species.
antinatalism,f5rn702,t3_dosaba,1572398290.0,"Plenty of people I will lovingly refer to as ‘savages’ do this. We let anyone with anything breed for the sake of breeding or my personal favorite - due to social pressure to procreate and babies are born with Disease, deformities and disabilities of any given kind are wandering around broken and infected sadly inside and out. Some outwardly and some secretly wishing they weren’t here because the future is bleak and no amount of buck up will make it better.. especially if your future has paralysis in it. Smh I apologize for your possible future."
antinatalism,f5rmdjp,t3_dolflb,1572397744.0,"Soon no woman will have any rights to exercise her judgement in bringing a while human being into this ever crowding world . Burn me at the stake but I’m proud of you. I don’t think even the healthiest of anyone or anything should be put to trial in this hellishly sad world. I wish my mother had gone through with it. To this day I’m angry with her every time I’m going down my spiral, someone hurts me or breaks my heart, every failure, every time I spill coffee on myself I’m angry with her for not doing me the favor of aborting me when she had the chance. Most people I know hate being alive but they don’t have the balls to say they’re angry with their parents because they experience a little bit of happiness which is supposed to be good enough to live on. 5% of happiness isn’t worth a hundred years on this planet. Bless your heart and stay strong."
antinatalism,f3mbuuz,t3_dhcn36,1570986040.0,"Omg same! Bless your heart. I’m the same way I am an only child from a dwittling bloodline and I get the you’ll have a kid one day tag line all the time. Like no. I’m miserable every second of existence watching everyone in drone mode chasing pleasure while they suffer and it’s so appalling that people bring other people into this mess just because they want kids and think they’re like puppies that’ll be cute forever. Never mind they’re suffering in the future; the disappointment of first heartbreak, being chosen last because there’s always someone or something better, the fake friends they’ll attain because everyone is too sucked into their own madness to actually truly care about anyone or anything else but themselves (and rightfully so) and the endless banter to keep chasing their dreams and happiness because it just gets oh so much better! *Eye roll * just not about it."

I am an only child and I’ve stressed I don’t want or will have kids I will adopt if it gets that bad but I doubt I want that life. E fluids are banned because of them, people get to call off work or anything else because of them, people get paid 2000$ a head while singles get jack shit, god forbid you’re not a breeder... COMMA pictures of them are fucking endless and every reaction besides aaaawwwwwwwwww ensues a look akin to being smacked in the face.... I just fucking can’t! Thank you for your brave souls!"
