When you steadily advance in your career as a result of a sustained effort (which fundamentally implies sacrifice of other areas) you find it‚Äôs a tricky thing. ‚ÄúI work so hard, I deserve to come home to a safe, comfortable place‚Äù becomes the type of dangerous sentiment that exceeds the mere collection of luxury goods your younger self wanted. 

Compound that with increases coming in steadily (so it‚Äôs not like salary doubled over night but by increments‚Äîa different fiscal planning exercise entirely as your lifestyle grows at a smaller, sneakier pace) and add more ideological changes such as ‚Äúmy kids deserve the best education‚Äù and you can quickly find yourself living beyond your means.
