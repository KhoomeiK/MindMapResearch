Anxiety,fdra0sl,t3_emr4z6,1578681573.0,"Ugh seriously. Because I have anxiety, my doctors wouldn't listen to me about severe pain in my stomach a month after my c-section. It turned out I had severe gastritis from the Naproxen they gave me. So annoying."
JUSTNOMIL,fdo3qc8,t3_em9y23,1578598337.0,"So I dug in your profile. That dress. God, you're beautiful. You're going to be absolutely stunning on your wedding day (even though you already are). Don't change your dress!! It's beautiful!! I hope you have a lovely wedding."

PlasticSurgery,f60lksj,t3_dpzzav,1572620284.0,"I saw your comments about people saying you're ugly. I mean, they're obviously blind. You are one good looking guy and you shouldn't change a thing."
Anxiety,f050lr6,t3_d3qymk,1568399986.0,"Are they going to take my ""haha"" as sarcasm? I better to change it to ""lol"". No, wait. That's probably worse!"

fearofflying,ewphou1,t3_cpgnh6,1565641412.0,You're going to be okay!! Try some deep breathing while listening to your favourite music. That always helps me a little. You got this!!
beyondthebump,ev1nnog,t3_ci4rju,1564162020.0,Yes I totally agree with this! By the time I would fall asleep baby would be getting up already!
Anxiety,es4km9g,t3_c5uovo,1561587043.0,I hope you got the job!! Way to go on telling your anxiety to take a hike!!
fearofflying,es0z0yl,t1_es0yoaq,1561485838.0,"I forgot to add something else that really helped me was that anytime there was turbulence, I pictured the plane sitting in jello and wiggling a bit. The air viscosity changes up there and while I don't completely know the science behind it I was told that essentially it's like the plane is sitting in jello and it might jiggle but that's all it is. Best of luck!!"
fearofflying,es0yoaq,t3_c5bs3k,1561485631.0,You will be okay! I completely understand your fear as I have just completed a transatlantic trip. What helped me was deep breathing and counting slowly on every breath. You're going to get through this!!
fearofflying,es0xezz,t3_c5atu8,1561484919.0,You are going to be okay! Deep breaths and count slowly with each one. You got this!
fearofflying,ery11wj,t1_erxvgyc,1561398023.0,Oh wow I believe it! That sounds like a fun time though! I'm glad it went well for you!
fearofflying,erpn4da,t1_erplsf0,1561122889.0,"I think I would like to (hopefully) go back to London next year or maybe somewhere else in Europe now that it won't be the first time doing a transatlantic flight!
How about yourself? Are you planning on taking any trips in the near future? It's nice to be able to plan with more ease!"
fearofflying,erpkvm6,t1_erorpdw,1561120959.0,I think I was at about 3-4 before this trip. I did deep breathing in my nose and out of my mouth and I would count to ten slowly. It also helped thinking of the plane being in jelly whenever turbulence happened! I thought of jelly and speed bumps lol.
fearofflying,eropoez,t1_eropdia,1561085306.0,The breathing helped a lot and I think in general I was watching the flight attendants and everyone was just so calm and collected so I kept saying they're okay so everything is okay it will be fine.. It helped a lot and I think on a scale of 0-10 I'd be about a 7-8! I still have a little work to do with it but it's definitely a lot better than it was! I never thought I'd take a flight overseas and now I've already come back from one! Woohoo!
fearofflying,erood3h,t1_eq9w52y,1561084302.0,I went on the trip and it was awesome I'm so glad I went! I did my deep breathing and just kept telling myself that everything was okay so much that I actually started to believe it lol. All in all it went very well!
fearofflying,eq9w6b5,t1_eq9w52y,1559919347.0,Thank you!! ðŸ˜Š
fearofflying,eq9s9n8,t1_eq912y1,1559916611.0,You've given me a lot of useful info about why the planes won't just fall out of the sky though! Thanks again! I will definitely give you a update when I come back!
fearofflying,eq90e08,t1_eq8zyxf,1559881217.0,I'm travelling with my sister so that'll be fun on its own but I'm still going to bring music and books and a couple puzzle books as well. On the flight to London we will be travelling overnight so I hope I'll be able to fall asleep.
fearofflying,eq8zbm7,t1_eq8z215,1559880132.0,We're flying out of Winnipeg to Toronto and then from Toronto to London. On the way back we are flying to Calgary and then Winnipeg and the flight to Calgary is going to be 9 hours lol
fearofflying,eq8ssyw,t1_eq8sehp,1559874449.0,"Thank you so much I definitely will! I've never been over seas so I'm pretty excited and nervous and all over the place lol! I'll give you an update when I get back! Thanks again! I love seeing people overcome their fears, especially flight fears."
fearofflying,eq8ou6e,t1_eq8njm8,1559871115.0,Wow I had no idea about the air viscosity! That is actually really comforting to hear that it's not like the air on the ground. I will definitely try to not tense up if there is turbulence and just go with the speed bumps. Thank you so much. You've been a huge help.
fearofflying,eq8mdal,t1_eq8m034,1559869058.0,I just have a huge fear that all of a sudden we will have really bad turbulence and go down. I'm flying with my sister who is a seasoned traveller so that helps. She's also bringing her laptop with our favourite shows to watch lol. So far during take off I'm going to do deep breathing and count as long as I need!
fearofflying,eq8losm,t3_bxnhia,1559868495.0,This is awesome! I've been looking forward to your update! I'm so glad you had a great time. This makes me feel better since I leave in two days for Europe.
fearofflying,eq7a2hp,t3_bxje9l,1559843189.0,Good luck! I hope your flight is great! I'm also travelling in two days and I'm super nervous.
pregnant,eonm22t,t3_bsg6qj,1558715896.0,I had a rough pregnancy and I'm also a FTM. It was really really hard. She was born in December and I would do it all again for her if I had to! It's worth it :) hang in there! You're doing greatðŸ§¡
