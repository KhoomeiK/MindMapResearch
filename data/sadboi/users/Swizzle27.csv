bipolar,fjh7osi,t3_fdc42b,1583342830.0,I have an interview today! Hoping for the best!
bipolar,f7bfixw,t3_dv8mk5,1573567457.0,Currently in the hospital due to a mixed episode..... for me it’s not being able to sleep and having all this energy but still having suicidal thoughts. It’s impulsive decision along with the reckless behaviour. That’s what makes it scary. I’d talk to your doctor see what they say. Hospitalization isn’t too bad it’s a safer place to control what’s going on in your head.
piercing,f3hsqp4,t3_dgyiix,1570928018.0,That’s super cute!!
Bestbuy,f2h32bj,t3_dc3key,1570238767.0,A flathead screwdriver works! Thieves did that at one of the stores I worked at a lot.....
bipolar,f2dr0gl,t1_f2dq3pf,1570161935.0,Thank you. And honestly it’s like the lows are get lower and the highs higher. And 90% of the time my mania turns into a mixed episode.
medical,f1oi8gr,t1_f1ohobv,1569646599.0,..... I honestly don’t know what to say but you should be glad I like dad jokes lol
medical,f1oi6zg,t1_f1ohzym,1569646553.0,I’ve never had stitches before this so I’m not entirely sure how it’s supposed to heal. I did exactly what they told me to take care of it so if it is getting infected might be because it wasn’t cleaned properly. Definitely leaning towards getting it checked though!
medical,f1ohnpg,t3_dabkdu,1569645949.0,So stabbed myself by accident on a chefs knife. Went about a half inch deep. Went into emerg and got stitches. Doctors said they couldn’t “see” any damage. However didn’t do any imaging of any sort. I’m having a lot of pain throughout my thumb and fingers. And moving my wrist back and forth I feel like a tendon popping. Trouble gripping with my last 3 fingers as well. I did stab myself with a knife so I know pain is normal not sure if I should go back or not.
memes,eyl5jul,t1_eykzyzv,1567176712.0,I feel you there... and sometimes my elbow locks sometimes too !
bipolar,ewfv4eq,t1_ewfv2zf,1565368045.0,Pretty much!
bipolar,ewfv1ca,t1_ewfqmd9,1565367994.0,I feel you there but in reality I’m just manic because I’m off my drugs again.
bipolar,ev8rw1a,t3_cim4uc,1564289272.0,Literally my life right now! Like honestly ever time I see something I always think of something that will hurt  or kill me. Like no brain what are you doing!?!
medical,erw7rtl,t1_erw7jxv,1561335631.0,Okay thank you! I’ll probably go in just in case !
medical,erw78tr,t1_erw6otr,1561335203.0,It doesn’t hurt when I touch it  (not sure if it’s because I did it about 8 hours ago) only hurts on the tip of the elbow which still stings. When bending my elbow it also stings from the skin stretching
medical,erw5xta,t3_c4erxu,1561334165.0,Further info:  burnt by grabbing honey out of the microwave (bottle exploded) this morning. I accidentally left it in there too long. I ran it under cold water when it happened.  I currently have it wrapped I changed it out about an hour ago it is oozing yellow fluid. Not sure if I should just wait or go see a doctor.
