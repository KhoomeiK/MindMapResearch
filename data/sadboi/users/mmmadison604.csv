I never use to like cooking and use to eat out all the time but once I learned some basics (mainly from watching IG stories from home chefs- -social media can be quite useful!), I got hooked. I always try to eat at home now because I like to know what's in my food and preparing my meals. Like someone else posted, an Instant Pot is great! I also like making buddha bowls with lots of different veggies and proteins, add a grain, a sauce, and voila! I'm really active and quite a foodie so for me having a higher budget for food is worth it-- but only high quality and nutritious foods that I actually enjoy.  


As for getting your weight under control, you sound like a pretty smart person so I would recommend learning about the science of weight loss, nutrition, workouts, etc. Once you get into it and find an exercise you enjoy, weight loss can be pretty simple-- if you look at it as a ""lifestyle change"" rather than simply ""trying to lose weight."" Also try to walk everywhere as every step counts! Walking is a great form of exercise even though it doesn't seem like much, but it keeps your cortisol levels low and you can also throw on a podcast or audio book and go for a walk, while getting some vitamin D. Habit stacking! ;)"

CBD,esaqxn5,t1_esaiwfg,1561766243.0,"No prob! Yep, since the effect from vaping is so quick and intense, I can imagine that happening. 👌 sometimes when I take too much CBD during the day I just feel a little spacey and just super relaxed... not complaining though!!"
CBD,esa6b0q,t1_es99rdn,1561752498.0,"What type of ""effect"" are you looking for? Dosing cannabis is so tricky because it also depends on your metabolism, what you ate-- basically a balance between how you ingest it and how quickly your body eliminates it. When taken orally, it has to go through your digestive tract before going into your blood stream, so it could take up to a few hours to take into effect. If you're not in any chronic pain that interferes with your lifestyle, I would recommend you up your dosage slowly. But I'm not a health practitioner or anything.... just what I know based on my own research because CBD has really changed my life.

I use CBD for the same reasons as you: anxiety + athletic recovery + general wellness. I find for recovery, topicals (1:1) work better because I can rub it on the muscles or whatever is bugging me.

For anxiety and work stress, I take 10-20mg throughout the day (few hours apart). Since CBD doesn't get you high, it just gives me a general sense of wellbeing--- not something I really ""physically"" notice BUT I do notice that I am much calmer and relaxed when I think back to it. I also take it for menstrual cramps too and they work like Tylenol-- makes you kinda forget the pain and I always forget that I took CBD as well and just get on with my day. For me, that's how ""pain killers"" are supposed to work!

Also if you're not already, make sure you take the tinctures sublingually-- hold it under your tongue for up to 1.5 minutes for quicker absorption. If you want quick relief, vaping is probably the fastest way to get into your bloodstream - for that sharp and quick hit. Apparently the cannabinoids' peak stream levels in your blood will only be about 10min through vaping, but 1-6hrs when taken orally (which is ideal for anxiety + mood disorders)."
CBD,es8rp94,t1_es8rhoz,1561711084.0,"Ooh gotcha! I would imagine you will still feel the effects of the CBD because your body would have absorbed all the cannabidiols.

I have girlfriends who started using CBD in their skincare and will check to see their results. I've heard many good things..

CanadianMOMs,erta0r9,t3_c3kquk,1561236579.0,"Def RSO for potency but make sure you get one that has been tested for potency, pesticides, etc. I would add some CBD isolate in it (for accurate dosage). Another alternative is to get a 1:1 broad spectrum product for the entourage effect which is better for more intense symptoms.  


I believe dosage is different for everyone and especially for CBD, ""more"" is not always better. I'd start with 10mg first to see how your body reacts to it and then increase it slowly. But since CBD is non-psychoactive, even if she takes a large dose, she won't get high... her body may just not absorb all of it.  


I love distillate edibles too because they are the only ones that don't give me anxiety!! Hmm.. what about distillate + cbd iso? That way you can accurately dose. I'd probably use MCT oil as a carrier since it seems to be best for absorption. I like the Bulletproof ""Brain Octain"" MCT oil. It's kinda pricey, but I think it's one of the high quality ones on the market."
CanadianMOMs,ert7n63,t3_c3ll7e,1561234710.0,"Full spectrum is better for medicinal purposes as the its effectiveness increases as you administer higher dosages. The full plant extract also contains cannabinoids, terpenes, or healthy fatty acids which creates that ""entourage effect"" when you combine it all together. It is definitely more expensive than isolate I think.. but it's all controversial however, some people believe isolate is better because the fact that you aren't consuming the rest of the plant matter other than the CBD itself, gives you a more powerful punch.

I'm a huge fan of CBD isolate for wellness in general (I take 10-20mg a day), it especially works for anxiety (for me at least)!! But for certain things such as intense muscle pain relief, I would definitely take a 1:1 (depending how much it hurts). I've also taken my tinctures made from isolate for menstrual pain relief and such... it works for me!  
One of the benefits of CBD isolate is that because of it's absence of THC, it won't show up on drug tests. :)"
