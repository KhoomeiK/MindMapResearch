awfuleverything,fpz20cx,t1_fpz06db,1589012192.0,"I was sexually assaulted and I am a man. I was conscious and it was way worse. I also had sex while unconscious on psychiatric drugs. The first time it was a man and it was forced and I hated it. The second time I had vaginal sex and lost my virginity from it. I guess because I am a man there is less stigma from sex but I ended up having sex with the girl again and I was not personally hurt by it. If it was someone I was less attracted to it would have made more of a difference but date rape is not nearly as bad as someone raping you with a knife while you are conscious in my opinion. When I was in a psych ward I was drooling from my mouth and foaming out of the mouth and going through schizophrenia. There were also girls who had sex with me while this happened and I never really cared honestly but If I did care and it was men, I would rather be raped unconscious then raped by someone beating the shit out of me. It is less traumatic. I've had electric shock treatments while under anesthesia. It would have been 100 times more traumatic if there was no anesthesia and I was able to feel and be present for the whole thing. There was one time when I was locked up when a man who was my roommate would masturbate publicly and he wiped his cum on me. I was still recovering from ""booty juice"" (booty juice is slang for Haldol and Thorazine injected into your buttocks used to put someone to sleep) and this man did this to me and I knew I could not do anything. He did it in front of other people and it was traumatic. It would have been more traumatic if he was actually stronger than me and hit me while he was doing it. It would have been less traumatic if he did that to me when I was sleeping and I found out about it later. Nuance is important"
awfuleverything,fpyrqae,t1_fpypu0m,1589008343.0,I don’t think people should go to jail for doing drugs. I also think prostitution should be legal and regulated. Rape and violence should get a few years but I would simply prefer having more community service and house arrest to prison because when you are prison you are surrounded by other criminals and you can become more of a product of your environment. I understand the hypocrisy of putting drug offenders 30 years and rapist 5 years. But my proposal is to have less people in prison and for less time. Serial killers deserve life in prison and so do some serial rapists. But I think a more effective approach to punishment is less time just make it more isolating and miserable. Date raping someone through drugs should be 6 months in solitary and 2 years of house arrest and 2000 hours of community service. Gang behavior should be solitary then be under house arrest for a very long time as well as intensive therapy and control whoever comes in and out of the house and phone and internet usage. Then give them thousands of hours of community service. I don’t agree with prison culture and how shitty we treat prisoners. We laugh whenever we say don’t drop the soap even though there are non violent offenders in prison. Prison is also very expensive to maintain. More mental health care should be provided to prisoners and lay people as well.
awfuleverything,fpyo2gb,t1_fpy43dk,1589006978.0,5 to 7 years is a long time. It is not a slap on the wrist. Prison is miserable and 7 years is a really long time. You wouldn’t know if you have not experienced it. I prefer to put someone in jail for 5 years then put them on house arrest for 5 years where they can work a remote job but do not get the opportunity of committing crimes. Also community service should be used more. I’ve never been to prison but I did spend time in a psych ward and It is awful being in solitary confinement. I wouldn’t even wish 25 years of prison on anyone but a murderer. It is so fucked when everyone likes to complain that Someone only gets 5 10 or 15 years not knowing what it is like to spend that much time behind bars.many people age out of crime as well.
clevercomebacks,fpymtsg,t3_gfwkqs,1589006461.0,"I mean I don’t think any economy would function well during a quarantine. Even social democracies like Sweden are being affected economically. My problem with the economy was that it was being artificially boosted by debt. Even though we were getting record growth we were getting record debt and the interest rates set by the fed should have been higher. I also think we shouldn’t allow checking accounts to lend out money in order to control inflation. I think we should get rid of Medicare and social security and entitlement programs and replace it with a UBI based on a 20 percent vat tax. Capital gains and income tax should be set at a flat rate of 30 percent. However all income made up to 50 percent more than the poverty line would be tax free. So the first 19,000 you make would be tax free. Then if you have kids you would get a 8000 deduction for the first child and 6000 for every other child after the first. Tax capital gains as income. And instead of taxing profit from corporations we should tax dividends at 30 percent. Then let profits be tax free as long as it is reinvested back into the company. On the state level all state taxes should be replaced with a land value tax. Meaning instead of taxing the property on top of the land just tax the land itself."

He is donating all of his money to his foundation to improve global health. Hundreds of millions of people do not have toilets and poor sanitation kills millions a year. He sponsored projects to create new affordable toilets to be built in third world countries. He has given millions of vaccines and has helped people get nets to protect from malaria. Not everything is a conspiracy. I understand that conspiracies do occur but not everything is a malevolent conspiracy that schizophrenic conspiracy people like to make it out to be. I have seen many people on Reddit and youtube talk about how bill gates are getting rich off vaccines. It is false. And there is no proof he created a special strain of the coronavirus, just so he can donate vaccines to people. It makes no logical sense. Until you find extraordinary evidence that this is true that can be proved without any reasonable doubt then you have no right to make an extraordinary claim that the bill gates, or the Illuminati,  globalists, the jews, or the lizard people are behind all world events"

Biden won Texas which is turning bluer but won't likely be winnable for another two election cycles. But Biden will win in Georgia which can swing left in an election.

It also prevents a poverty trap where the benefits from government are better than from working and if you work you lose benefits. But I agree this whole nationalizing companies makes no sense. The only government services I support are natural monopolies like roads and infrastructure. I would prefer the federal government to collect a vat tax and distribute a UBI and enforce treaties and the law. But put most of the power in the states hands. If California and New York want high taxes they can vote for higher taxes in there state and let other states set there own tax rates. States should be funded by land value taxes and the federal government could fund a UBI through VAT tax and then have a 20 percent income tax of income over 30,000"
Libertarian,fkuu2dg,t1_fkuncmw,1584556143.0,I’m a geo libertarian but I support a UBI in replacement of social security and all other entitlements. I think you are free to have the fruits of your labor but land does not belong to anyone and the first dibs on land ownership philosophy does not make any sense. What makes the most sense would be to tax land and redistribute the land value tax of land back to the community. Having exclusive land ownership is a privilege you need to pay for. By claiming full control of land your are limiting others right to have that land arbitrarily. But if you compensate everyone for the right to have Exclusive access to land every year by paying land rent then it’s a fair deal. I support guns and the second amendment. Socially I’m fully libertarian. I also support vat taxes and pigovian taxes in pollution that have negative externalities. But libertarians are too cushy with republicans

politics,fku7bvo,t1_fku11pr,1584543789.0,Some industries are natural monopolies or oligopolies. The start up cost for an airline is very high and the competition is still steep. Not everyone has billions of dollars left over to start an airline and having several large airlines benefit from economies of scale just regulate them. Internet is a natural monopoly as all the cost is in fixed cost and variable cost. The infrastructure is so expensive and complex google couldn’t accomplish it and backed out. Startups like spaceX want to beam internet through satellite which would improve things. But I could see making the case of a state owned internet company. Since building the same infrastructure twice cost twice as much and you split customers in half of two large companies are competing against each other. Basically it’s a double whammy spend double the money and get half the customers in a two way competition. Now imagine 10 internet companies directly competing in a small town or small city. In order to make a profit the cost of internet would have to be 5 times higher at least to stay in business. So it makes sense to have internet as a utility company. However the government would have to acquire all preexisting companies and a 10 percent premium at least which would be very expensive. I don’t believe in just seizing the means of production without compensation or else that would be theft. It also does not send a good message to entrepreneurs who want to create a business and it could be completely seized by the government one day

Coronavirus,fktgmm5,t1_fktg1yb,1584518913.0,FDRs economic policies unfortunately stopped due to the democrats support of the civil rights movement that divided the party for decades and republicans won back a lot of control. Then came stagflation. Keynesian economist were unable to explain it and address the issue. Then a new wave of neoclassical economist diagnosed the problem and provided a solution. That’s why fdr style Keynesianism was not brought back. Most economists are now neokeynesians or neoclassical. But you are also seeing A new form called modern monetary theory. Bernie isn’t an old school Keynesian like fdr was. His economists are modern monetary theory people. Keynes believed in balanced budgets over an economic cycle. Meaning when we have recessions increase spending and deficits and when we have a growing economy decrease deficits and have a surplus. MMT proposed changing the roles of the fiscal and monetary policy. MMT proposes printing money to pay for government programs and using taxation to control inflation. MMT also proposes a guaranteed job. But MMT also opposes the current role of the federal reserve. Economics has changed and Keynes was a prominent economist before many things were understood and many Keynesian policies have been disproven but Keynes advice on recessions is still highly regarded

Apple was one of the few companies that bet all there money in China being a stable country. What will really happen is based on how long this crisis last it will reduce all economic activity and corporate debt is at an all time high and they will bleed money and could default in debt and the bond market could crash.

We now have a services based economy in that services make up 70 percent of consumption but back then it was more manufacturing based but we still were always consuming. The economy has grown and everyone is wealthier and we consume more. Technological innovations as well as economic growth and more productivity is why we are able to consume more. We had a demand problem were we experienced deflation and consumption was too low and the stock market crash lead to lay offs and unemployment grew and the more people that became unemployed the less consumption which lead to more people getting unemployed and the cycle continued. We didn’t see large scale changes in economic growth and unemployment till around the time America entered world war 2.

You are not doing the math. Even among all large money donations of over $2500 its less than 1.5 billion all together which would be flooded out compared to 5.4 billion. Politicians would not need big money donors and are free to criticize other opponents but it’s useless to limit people’s freedom to what they can do with there money.

politics,fktb1f5,t1_fktajr8,1584512236.0,Nope because I already said no unlimited donations to others campaigns just that you can use your own money on your own campaign. If you have enough supporters you will raise a sufficient amount of money to win. You don’t necessarily need to be the most funded candidate. It’s about having enough money to operate a campaign. It’s not irrelevant. If you are running for mayor of a city and raise 1 million dollars and you are running against someone with several million or maybe 10 million or more you still have enough money to get people to know you
politics,fkt9919,t1_fkt8hq9,1584510338.0,Well the fact of the matter is I think you should be able to use your own money but people should be able to choose where they give there money to rather than the government allocating equal payment to anyone who runs for office. Presidential elections show that media coverage is more important than money raised. Donald trump was outspent and won. Bloomberg lost horribly despite spending a half a billion dollars. So we are mostly talking congressional and gubernatorial elections. I like the idea of people deciding who they want to support even if it’s with government money but I don’t support the government just handing any candidate money who wants to run a campaign. I do support a government run website that provides information about candidates and all the issues they support. Candidates would just answer questions and submit there responses to the website. But if some billionaire wants to run for governor I think he should be able to spend his own money promoting himself and getting others to donate to him. If his or her policies suck and people don’t like him/her voters won’t vote for him/her. You can’t buy votes you can buy ads to promote yourself but that’s it
Coronavirus,fkt8la7,t1_fkt82ik,1584509686.0,Yeah we discussed it in my economics class. Someone did a research paper on it and concluded that the new deal was less effective because of high taxes but once world war 2 started we essentially reached full employment and the increase in spending was a giant stimulus to the economy.

politics,fkt7psp,t1_fkt6cx6,1584508843.0,I disagree you are free to do what you want with your own money. Many things are unfair advantages. Being able to speak fluently and clearly is a unfair advantage that people who have speech impediments and strokes are unable to compete. Government funds increase taxes you have a right to property in this country. If you want to have more money than an opponent either start a business invest your left over money or do something that makes a lot of money. It’s unfair to ban people using there own money on themselves. If you are jealous make more money. I believe the best way to ensure that we don’t end up a plutocracy would be to give every American democracy dollars that can be only used for donations to political campaigns. Every person over 18 gets 100 dollars to spend on elections during election years. Ban super pacs from directly endorsing candidates. Meaning a super pac can essentially advertise all a candidates policies but can not say who has those policies or who to vote for. Then have just have a limit on campaign contributions as we already have.
neoliberal,fkt6xww,t1_fkt6bpi,1584508132.0,Which is what I’m saying. A democratic socialist became the leader he got the society hooked on entitlements that they couldn’t pay for and it crashed shortly after his death. Same thing happened in Yugoslavia after Tito. Bernie may be capable but whoever comes after him can destroy the country. But once you set the precedent that the federal government will be in charge of managing 50 percent of the US economy and the power of the presidency is greatly expanded. And we get people to not question leaders economic policy and say that the rich have all the wealth and all we have to do is take it away from them and everyone will be better off

neoliberal,fkt12ff,t1_fksz0tn,1584503332.0,I mean there is over 1900 delegates required to win. Before today Biden was at less than half so it made sense to stay in the race. I think by April 28 he will drop out or drop out after April 28. Bernies biggest chance is on New York. I heard Bernie is likely going to lose in Wisconsin and Wyoming I haven’t seen polls for Hawaii or Alaska. But if he loses 7 states straight in a row his momentum will be completely gone and he’ll drop out.

worldpolitics,fksxaqv,t1_fkswxpf,1584500596.0,You are telling rich people to donate all there money to stop the corona virus even though many are like bill gates. Many billionaires have only a couple million in actually cash and this is the worst time to sell stock. But if you have 2 million in cash and donate 80 percent of it you still have to pay your bills which are much higher because they consume more and donating a million dollars won’t help much. Bill gates donated 100 million and plans to donate several billion more but no leftist wants to acknowledge it. They are just full of envy and it blinds there thought process

politics,fksvae2,t1_fksu75c,1584499223.0,I’m not necessarily against billionaires in politics as long as they have good ideas. I think Bloomberg had the worst ideas from both parties. Many politicians have been rich like the kennedys or the Roosevelt’s. George Washington was rich. If bill gates ran for governor and had good ideas I’d vote for him. Being rich is an asset because they are less reliant on fund raising. Fund raising takes up a lot of time and requires you to make compromises. In congress al Frankenstein said more than 60 percent of a congress persons time is spent fundraising. If you had someone who was reasonable and had money I wouldn’t count them out just for being rich.
Coronavirus,fkstk1e,t1_fksoydi,1584498065.0,The new deal is still debated whether it had much effect. World war 2 was the main reason we got out of the depression. Roosevelt was more conservative on deficits initially. World war 2 was the huge stimulus that grew the economy but the new deals economic effects are still debated even among liberal economists
Coronavirus,fkssgc4,t1_fksm4vk,1584497335.0,"It usually is rare in recessions to ever get higher than 12 percent. I think we haven’t seen 20 percent since the Great Depression. The fed under bernanke was very intelligent and saved us from the Great Recession. The stimulus worked and the government profited 115 billion from the bailout. Meaning we lent out less than 650 billion and and got all that money back plus 115 billion. Than started raising interest rates to limit a bubble from happening. Trumps fed chair started lowering interest rates in a rapidly growing economy. The fed has no ammo left. A stimulus won’t work in the short term. No matter what people will not be working for the next month at least. We have a supply and demand problem. The fed should have offered a smaller stimulus package and wait till after this virus is contained to inject trillions in liquidity into the market. A temporary UBI would be the best course of action. The fed should be on hold till after we make progress in containment of the virus. After the virus is contained and decreasing whether it’s in two months or 6 months, people won’t have jobs and companies will have no money. Also corporate debt was at an all time high so corporations won’t be able to pay off debt which will ripple through the economy. This will be worse than the 2007 financial crisis"

politics,fksqxtm,t1_fksjltc,1584496338.0,I wasn’t around for Ross Perot but I’ve looked him up before and his policies didn’t seem that crazy. He wanted to put term limits and reduce the deficit. Also little known fact Donald trump ran on the reform party ticket for president in 2000 and advocated a wealth tax to pay off the national debt. At this point the national debt has reached a point of no return after the wars in the Middle East the recession and Donald trump increasing it to juice up the economy. But Ross Perot seamed more reasonable than Donald trump. Also wasn’t Ross Perot more self made and more of a real billionaire. His movement lead to almost nothing the only person elected to major office was Jesse Ventura who was an ex professional wrestler. David duke also joined the party which really tainted there name. But the reform party still exists in New York.

GeoLibertarianism,fksd0hp,t1_fisyi1f,1584487335.0,Make them revenue neutral. Tax different forms of pollution and distribute revenue equally to citizens. Meaning a carbon tax of $100 per ton would raise more than a 500 billion dollars. It would then be given equally as a dividend to every citizen in the United States. So everyone would get about 1600 a year. But if you use more than the average person you’d be losing money. If you used less than the average person you make money. It creates incentives to use as little carbon as possible and reducing carbon footprint
GeoLibertarianism,fksc8ed,t3_f9hp5w,1584486847.0,"Mine is a revenue neutral carbon tax as well as taxes on methane. Basically the tax revenue would be divided equally and given back to the citizens. So if you use more carbon than average you would lose money if you use left carbon than average you make money. People respond to incentives and a 100 per ton carbon tax would make a gallon of gas cost 1 dollar more per gallon. Eventually raise it by $10 to the point that it’s 200 dollars a ton of carbon so it’s $2 tax per gallon. This would make electric cars and investment in alternative energy more financially attractive. Coal would be wiped out and replaced with natural gas and they would all eventually be replaced by nuclear, solar and wind. Land for conservation that would be limited interaction by humans would be tax free. If the land is crucial for a specific ecosystem than the land value tax would be much much higher. People could buy land and would be required to spend a certain amount to maintain the land but it could not be used for commercial or residential purposes."
GeoLibertarianism,fksbb3e,t3_fajzz1,1584486255.0,I think it can be appealing to libertarians and Green Party high are the biggest third parties. A local land value tax could be implemented in lieu of a sales or property tax. It would best be implemented on a state level. Meaning all local and state taxes would be land value taxes. On the federal level a vat tax of 20 percent that is used for a UBI and getting rid of all other entitlement programs would be simpler and lead to less deadweight loss in the market. I think infiltrating the democratic or republican parties would be the best move. Third parties never win and party platforms are fickle. Bernie changed democrats and trump changed republicans. Bernie will still lose I think Andrew yangs movement a land value tax would fit well into it. Moderate democrats don’t have much of a platform it’s just a lighter more moderate version of whatever sanders comes up with. It’s a center left party and I think a land value tax and UBI would appeal to both the center left and center right. Democratic socialist don’t like it because it doesn’t involve socialism and trumpers only like what trump says and are usually skeptical of anything good for the environment like pigovian revenue neutral carbon taxes. But don’t focus on congress focus on mayors and state senates and county officials. Start local. You aren’t going to elect a Georgist president with having no local or state offices.

DemocraticSocialism,fkryixs,t3_fk53bd,1584478589.0,Well naturally if you were a hunter gatherer if you don’t work you don’t eat. Being able to start a business and own your labor is a big freedom. Giving the rights of your labor to the government is not very free your a slave. Land is the only thing you have no right to since humans didn’t create the land. Land must be taxed at 100 percent of its current value and get rid of property taxes. Meaning tax the land itself and not the buildings on top. Have a UBI rather than government control over the means of production
