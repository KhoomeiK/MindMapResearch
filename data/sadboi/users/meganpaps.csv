depression,fb9b2jd,t3_ec3ed6,1576633986.0,"My shitty parents did the same. Hurts like hell. I feel you on this. 

Instead of the love and compassion there's anger and resentment.

I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. Just know you're not alone."
depression,f9tomwg,t1_f9tm2mv,1575634655.0,"I'm very lucky to have the husband I do. When I just can't cope anymore he goes into action mode. He makes sure I call my doctor's and get to my appointments. If it wasn't for him and my children I would be gone. I still feel some days that it's all too much and I'm fighting a battle that I know will kill me eventually. However, having him as my war chief in this makes me not give up."
depression,f9sllr4,t1_f9sl990,1575594720.0,"Lol...that's my favorite. ""Shake it off"" ""Let things go"" ""Think happy thoughts"" ""Move on with your life"" ""Get out of the house, you'll feel better"" and on and on and on.

People can be so judgemental. Especially when they don't understand."
depression,f9sl8f5,t1_f9skezp,1575594528.0,"Winter time is horrible for me. Everything goes gray, dark and cold. I feel like the Earth is mimicking my thoughts and it just makes my illness 10 times worse."
depression,f9skzly,t1_f9skezp,1575594407.0,"Mine started around 11 years old. My life has been a string of shitty decisons and crappy choices. I have a few things that I did right, but those are overshadowed by the bad.
Depression never gets easier, just manageable. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy."
depression,f9sk31s,t3_e6qkct,1575593970.0,Same. Depression and anxiety. I recently became agoraphobic which sucks. I've been dealing for 30 years. How long have you had this crap?
depression,f9sj6f4,t1_f9sikrg,1575593496.0,"Well, me too. Is there a situation or is it depression?"
depression,f9sihcu,t3_e6qkct,1575593079.0,What's on your mind? I like chit chat.
depression,f9shl2k,t3_e6pwva,1575592569.0,Are you allowed to talk to her? If so ask her if you can reach out to her therapist on her behalf. Let her therapist know the situation. Maybe her therapist will do phone sessions with her.
depression,f9sgx10,t3_e6mi27,1575592205.0,I do this too. I've never been greeted that rudely though. When I know I'm going to an appointment concerning my mental illness I try to write down a few things that I am experiencing. I just make a list of my symptoms and hand it to my doctor.
depression,f9sgasa,t3_e6pr5x,1575591852.0,"You can absolutely cut off toxic family you live with! I myself had to cut off my mother at an early age. I was respectful and kept up with the day to day BS, but I quit letting her in. I stopped sharing anything of value or my feelings. I stopped letting her words and actions hurt me, thus taking her power away. I started to treat our relationship as a business. When I moved out I cut ties completely. Best decision I ever made."
depression,f9sfpa3,t1_f9r7t16,1575591532.0,I say something like this to people. I usually just tell them I feel like garbage. If they continue to pry and I don't want to explain it I just tell them it's personal and I don't want to get into it. Sometimes it's just too hard to smile and tell them I'm ok.
depression,f9sfcmh,t1_f9s9plj,1575591335.0,I do the leg thing too! I also pick at my nails and quit trying to look nice.
depression,f9sf0rh,t3_e6pahk,1575591161.0,Depression is usually only seen by those intimately close to the person. Only my husband and brother know I'm suffering. I put in my mask around every one else. For others I know that struggle with depression this seems to be a common theme.
depression,f9seiy5,t3_e6lf6r,1575590870.0,"Yep. Every one keeps telling me to get some exercise and fresh air. The last thing I want to do is be active and I certainly don't want to go outside. I have to force myself to get up to go to the bathroom, how the hell am I supposed to get up and jump around? Makes no damn sense."
depression,f9se4gd,t3_e6lhuk,1575590637.0,"I feel this deeply. I've struggled with depression and anxiety for 30+ years and I'm over it. I'm tired of trying to get help when it overtakes me. It takes so many phone calls, doctor's appointments, med changes, etc, etc...it's fucking exhausting. I don't really care if I ever get better at this point. I win the small battles trying to fight this, but I am losing the war and am ready to surrender."
depression,f9rpe9s,t1_f9imouv,1575579453.0,"I'm so sorry that happened to you. I must have been very lucky because my inpatient stay was wonderful. My insurance covered most of it and the hospital wrote the rest off because of my inability to pay.
It breaks my heart that the mental health system is so bad. No we're not outwardly dying but it is a true emergency. We are dying on the inside."
depression,f9ilhro,t1_f9ikkii,1575340031.0,"I had to go to a hospital and tell them I was suicidal to get help. I wasn't suicidal, but I knew I needed treatment immediately and couldn't wait months to get in to therapy. They got me into an inpatient center that day and they didn't discharge me until I had an appointment with a psychiatrist and therapist.
Sad it has to be that way."
depression,f9gropw,t3_e4zwr9,1575303763.0,"I try to force myself out. Go to your local animal shelter if you like dogs and cats. Offer to play with the animals that get overlooked. Go to the library and find books you don't think you'll like and try them anyway, you may surprise yourself. If you just can not leave the house (I have more days like this than not) go to forums you enjoy. Post comments to try to uplift someone. Pick one room in your home and one thing to do in that room. Dust, straighten up, sweep, whatever. Complete it. If you have enough energy, pick another task in that same room. Do as much as you can, but keep your goals short. It always makes me feel like I accomplished something and happy with myself that I completed a goal."
depression,f9gq82r,t3_e4zevn,1575303153.0,"Sometimes it gets to be too much and you need to be in a safe place, wherever that is for you. 
I give myself 24 hours to wallow in it when I need to. I make a deal that I am free to feel it, embrace it, and let it overwhelm me, but only for a day. After that it's back to business.
People like us that suffer are judged so harshly sometimes for feeling the way we do. It's ok to have feelings, ANY feelings. 
I don't know if this will work for you. Someone I was in patient with told me she was going to try this and I was on board. It has changed me for the better. I still suffer with depression and anxiety, but on my terms. Take control of it, don't let it control you."
depression,f9gp804,t3_e4yra1,1575302746.0,"SAME!!! My mother's a narcissist and my Dad is emotionally absent and was physically absent the better part of my life.
Best thing I ever did was cut them off. I don't speak to them or address them in any way. I took their power to hurt me away. Some days I feel so low, like why do I deserve love and happiness when my own parents don't care. Then, I try to remember that no one is responsible to make my life good except for me. I create my own destiny and don't want to give power to toxic people, no matter who they are.
I know it sucks and I feel you."
depression,f83fv64,t1_f81u9ma,1574211210.0,That's an interesting response. Mental illnesses and suicidal thoughts don't give a fuck how perfect or shitty your life is.
depression,f81iod6,t1_f819i4s,1574168680.0,"I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for 30+ years. I have been to many therapists, medication, even in patient hospitalization. I've tried exercise, meditation, yoga, healthy living, self help books...Still about every 2 years this thing rears it's ugly head. I've been told the medications stop working and I have to find a new ""cocktail"". I'm really just tired. It's exhausting to be like this for so very long."
depression,f81hvac,t1_f7zwqv0,1574167918.0,They don't know. I hide my feelings well. Have had to since I was a small child. They are the only reason I'm still here. If it wasn't for them I would have been gone years ago.
depression,f81hh0p,t1_f80v4ko,1574167537.0,"I have 2 doggos. Beautiful loving animals. When I'm alone they help me feel safe. BUT, they have my husband and kids too. They wouldn't really be losing much if I never came home again."
depression,f81h9ci,t1_f80v1h5,1574167328.0,"My children are the ONLY reason I'm still here. They have no idea what is going on with me. I am a good actress when it comes to my depression. Always have been. My husband doesn't even know. My brother is the only one, because he struggles with it too."
depression,f7zxzpr,t3_dyals2,1574117855.0,I feel this way too! As my depression worsens so does my hypochondria. As my hypochondria gets word so does the depression. I also become agoraphobic and have terrible panic attacks. Each symptom exacerbates the other symptoms. It's a shitty downward spiral.
