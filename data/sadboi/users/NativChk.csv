Thinking back, he tried to warn me that he’s not a giving lover. It’s hit and miss in that department with him.  He’s sweet and consistent but selfish in the bedroom. Ive always believed that a selfish lover will also be terrible in a relationship. I will give a few chances and allow an off night, but this is not something I can deal with for much longer. What kind of man get his and doesn’t make sure his partner receives the same enjoyment?!!!?"
