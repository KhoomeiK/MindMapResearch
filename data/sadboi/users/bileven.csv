AnxietyDepression,foutdbq,t3_g9joo6,1588090078.0,"I can relate. There were so many things affecting and stressing me at school. My hands were shaking every every minute I was at school. My mental health has improved  during the quarantineand i'ts the first time that I feel like I'm getting better.

I hate thinking about going back to shool, becuase I know I will get worse again.But thats just how it is and I guess we have to go through it. 

Stay strong."
