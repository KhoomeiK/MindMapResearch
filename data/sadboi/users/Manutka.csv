The point of the comment was that even for an open minded individual (however unbelievable you might think this is) sexting could still count as cheating, because it wasn't agreed upon, hidden from the partner, and therefore is a breach in trust. How liberal that trust was to begin with is a whole other story, which I would rather not have discussed over an example of my personal life."
AskReddit,fk77npg,t3_fgv0ct,1583930006.0,"Absolutely.

My ex came up to me and told me he was attracted to this girl he met recently, assuring me it was purely sexual. Alright, no biggie, I offer a try in an open relationship dynamic.

Later I find out that prior to coming clean about this to me he already texted her enough to feel guilty about it and DELETE THE TEXTS. And this is the exact point I lost my shit because he had no reason to hide the texts - I NEVER touch his phone, AND I said I was fine with them having a go.

So yeah, the attraction thingy is understandable - not anyone can accept it, which is also perfectly okay, but I get it. Lying and/or hiding stuff from your SO on the other hand? Instant breakup."

2. Worked his ass off while finishing his masters degree, in a country where payment for work was completely optional (there was this one time he came to work but the whole building was covered in police tape. He did a full 180 and never even asked what was going on because it was much safer than sticking your nose into whatever happened there. Apparently the CEO ""commited suicide"" with a big ass shotgun), just so that me and my mom will have so.ething to eat and he can surprise me with chocolate and happy meals here and there.
3. I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THAT UNTIL 2 YEARS AGO. I'M 25. In my mind I had the best childhood anyone could ever ask for, I had no idea we lived in poverty.
4. He upgraded my family's quality of life from that level to having 2 more children, now they live in the US, own a house, and are having the time of their lives in school and after.
5. He inspired me to be super passionate about my profession from a very early age, without ever pushing or demanding anything but honesty.
6. I have never seen him cry. But not in the ""he suppresses his feelings because he needs to be manly"" kind, but more like ""the absolutely most positive yet phlegmatic person I've ever met"". A few years ago (maybe 7-8?) we went to visit his grandfather's grave - my dad basically grew with him, since his own father wasn't in the picture. When we arrived and started cleaning the area, my dad was in a super great mood, talking to the gravestone, bragging to his grandpa about how big his children are, and where are we living right now, and our successes and stuff... I cried the whole ride home.
7. He will always bend over backwards to support his children and their interests. Any hobby I had, any interest I had, there was never a bigger fan of me (or my siblings) than my dad.
8. Dark humor. He taught me to take life easy with his witty and hilarious responses and jokes. 

I could go on and on, but you get the gist. Best dad ever."
relationship_advice,fjcn7lg,t3_fcmn6x,1583227673.0,"I was fine with both sides until she mentioned violating the safe word.

My ex and I both had some kinks that weren't really the other person's cup of tea. So 90% of the time we do something we both think is fun, and once in a while we would surprise each other with the kind of sex that the other person wants. To me, at least, it felt even more special and arousing that way - while still keeping both of us satisfied sexually on a regular basis.

The thing with kinks, of any kind, is that safety is sacred. Safe word/gesture is something you don't even joke about overriding - it's pretty much the only means of trust you have in a situation where you give full physical/mental/emotional control to another person.

This, in conjunction with her not being able to accept your ""kink"" (or rather, lack thereof, but you do have a strong preference for respectful sex), is a serious red flag. I don't know how important sex is in your life, but to me it would be an immediate deal breaker."

relationship_advice,fgbr2l8,t3_exrjxw,1580665237.0,"I know the feeling, but I don't think it should really worry you. First of all, yeah, porn is superficial. think of other kind of movies - not every movie that you like you would like to live in. In fact, I bet most of them you don't.

Second of all, a ""type"" is a very... fluid thing. In my experience even if someone has a distinct type, there are people who are complete opposites of that and still be more attractive than what he thought up as a type. Because type is physical appearance only, and attraction is so much more than that. Even if we stay in the superficial area - it's how you move, how you smell, your facial expressions, your voice and the sounds you make. Not to mention, you know, personality and all that jazz.

So yeah, as long as he makes you feel loved and sexy, I think you have nothing to worry about. I would talk with my bf about that, because sometimes there's a very simple explanation to that (his first gf, the teacher he had a crush on when he was little, etc.), but even if there isn't and that's just what turns him on in porn... it's nothing."
relationship_advice,fgblxem,t3_exr9fs,1580663538.0,"What scares you so much about the definition of ""dating""?

The beauty of a relationship is that you can define it from zero, without using the standard names for stuff. You don't have to be bf/gf to enjoy the dynamic of a person you're important to (and is important to you), and to have a healthy, fun sex life. Just... enjoy it for what it is now.

I think you should try and understand what in the bf/gf dynamic sounds unpleasant of unfitting for you, and talk to him about these boundaries. It could be sexual exclusivity, feeling like you have to spend a certain amount of time together, going on dates just to be together (and not to do something that you both actually want to do) - whatever that is that you don't want in a relationship.

Don't give up on fun times with a good person just like that, it's rare - enjoy it :) you can always cut it off later."

I completely agree with your point about anxiety over unmet measurable goals, but I don't think measurable has to be anxiety inducing. If we take teeth-brushing, I could set myself something akin ""brush teeth 10+ times a week"" and go with it - it still leaves me enough space to forget or laze out, but it's a commitment. I still see how this may lead to anxiety, but I find that I'm freaking out about lack of progress (even though progress has been made, just wasn't defined) more than I beat myself up about missing a day here and there.

Regarding your second point about classes and self reliance - I am going to a weekly fitness class, and I'm super proud that I only missed one day in the past four months (donated blood that day). Still, social life is extremely hard for me - I can be outgoing and enjoy company, but it takes a lot of effort, and I mean, A LOT. I often feel overwhelmed and physically sick when I make myself go out and talk to people - which is why self-reliance is not my goal, but rather my comfort zone. And you'd be surprised how low I've allowed myself to sink in terms of personal hygiene - not proud of it, but I can actually \*forget\* parts of it completely.

On the topic of open relationships - I really do think I'm okay with that.

Parents poisoning the dog - obvious.
I consider you an a-hole not for your refusal to pay, but because you let the dog get to this state. You don't get a dog if you need to leave to college and your family can't properly take care of it. You don't go to college (or find an option with housing that allows you to take a dog with you, especially since it's not a big dog) if you already have a creature depending on you. It's on you to find him a home that *will take care of him*.
I guess it's partially your parents fault allowing you to get a dog at such a young age without them taking proper responsibility for it, but c'mon, you left to college when you were 17? 18? You could make a better decision. Find someone to adopt him. Find a way to take him with you.

See, the thing is, I work. Not because I'm a spoiled child that wants extra pocket money, but because I have to to sustain myself. I also happen to work in the field I study - which, in addition to all the assignments being turned in ON TIME and IN PERSON (since apparently our university hasn't heard of online submission) proves that I KNOW MY SHIT.

And yet, I had to attend every damn lecture. We had two scheduling opportunities for this course, both of them being 12PM to 2PM on different days of the week, so I had to wake up at 5AM, go to work 7AM to 11AM, go to class, spend two hours of my life learning nothing new, then going back to work since I have to do at least 7 hours a day. And after lunch time is when all the meetings begin so I rarely had the option to eat before 7-8PM. And yes, this WAS my optimal timetable - the other options were way worse.

My point is - you're not a preschool teacher that has to teach children how to behave. You work in college - your sole purpose is to give your knowledge and then check it was received well. That's it. Nothing more.

You can never know the circumstances of every student, and it's never ""just your lecture"" - sadly you're probably not the only ahole there."

My point is that it's impossible to satisfy every need for every single client, and it makes perfect sense to focus on the moneymakers to stay afloat.

Legally - you'll probably get to walk away from it because the agency sounds sketchy and the surrogate mother sounds like an actual MOTHER that won't leave a BABY to die (which is basically what you're doing by leaving it with a family that struggles as is).

If it concerned you that much, why didn't you bother to do a DNA test while she was pregnant? I'd think that people who care that much about the baby being theirs would think of it.

I'm fine with abortions, but I wouldn't be able morally to throw out a cat that I adopted, no matter the circumstances, so a baby you \*asked for\*?? Is your wife okay with it? Somehow it's hard for me to imagine a woman that went through three miscarriages just looking at a baby that is indeed part hers and goes like ""nah I don't want that"".

Edit: just to mention that you should indeed pursue legal actions against the agency, but you're still TA from a moral point of view."

Maplestory,ewl5tcl,t3_cor4up,1565507268.0,"THANK YOU. Finally someone looking into how things actually work. 

I would like to add a bit of insight on the dev's side, because it works the same whether they are Korean or American:

Tl;dr - don't hate on devs, we're sensitive ;-;

Here's how an average bug flow in a big corporation with YEARS of legacy code works:

1. A bug is posted to an info source (say, official Maplestory forums). It will take quite some time for it to get to the dev's backlog because, even if we ignore the time differences, it takes a lot of work. A person (or a team) should read it, check if it's something that happens to more people, check if it was already reported, whether it concerns other versions etc. Only then can a bug request be created. Please note that all the things mentioned here, if not done by the appropriate team immediately, will be done and/or delegated back by the dev's, which means even longer until the fix is issued.

2. Now we have a bug request. Great. Usually it's the support dealing with that first - how prioritized is this issue? Here we come to what's OP's post is all about. WE ARE NOT PRIORITIZED. No matter how much whales we think we have, the whole community is several times smaller than any other Maple community. But let's say the issue was prioritized because, idk, jms asked for it per OP's example. Now...

3. Which team's responsibility is it? In the best case: it's clear that it's team A's job, and team A happens to have a ""dinosaur developer"" that has been there from day one (or close to it), so that even if the newer members don't quite understand the old code, he knows what's on.
Otherwise, it takes time to find the team responsible (all the bugs you see are in GUI, but the GUI team only works on presentation of info fed to them from other teams, yadda yadda), then the actual bug seems to be in a code from 10 years ago which no one remembers since it was by that one person who was around for a year and then skedaddled, for some reason it won't reproduce on dev station, etc. I honestly could talk for hours just about general issues in bug investigation, and in addition to that every conpany has it's quirks.

4. Okay, bug was investigated solution was found and implemented (this could take weeks, mind you). Now we begin with the hell hole that is merges. Which versions should we merge this solution into? Should it only be in gms and jms (because these are the regions that complained) or are there other regions that are affected by this and just yet to complain? In case there are no merges, awesome. In case there are... we need to resolve conflicts and make sure we don't break anything, because each region is slightly different (not to mention language support).

5. Hooray! Now testing. Remember saying that we have to make sure we didn't break anything? Best case scenario - a fix is tested in every possible scenario of the game (spoiler - there might be just one or two, there might be hundreds). Worst case scenario - because of all the pressure they don't have time to test it and it rolls out half assed because there was some higher priority issue up their alley.

6. Scheduled maintenance. So just to perform an installation/replace the files on the server + restart it is, say, 1 hour. That's a good case, it could take more time. But then... we find a thingy that wasn't tested and crashes the game. Or we discover that the fix isn't really complete. Or the server just flops out and plains refuses to go up after the patch was installed and god knows why. So the maintenance gets longer. Players get frustrated. SavageAce cries in the corner.

Source: work as a software dev in a 20 year old company with lots of spaghetti code.

So yeah, I see why the community is frustrated. I understand that lags are the worst, and that not being able to access Damien for a month or two is a real heartbreak. But I can't blame the devs - I know what it's like to work until 2AM because a certain client needs thing done RIGHT NOW, and guys, I work in a medical field company. Those are hospitals we're talking about. So I really am willing to wait another few months if it means that the devs there get to have a work-life balance of sorts.

Obviously, I understand that the mentality there is different, and I do hope that things are a bit more organized there than what I described. But still - bug fixes is not something done in a day from start to finish. Maybe with exceptions like typo fix."

tl;dr: was slutshamed for not wearing a condom with a long term partner.

TMI ALERT!!

When I still was in the military I had some problems down there, including painful urination. I went to the army gynecologist, requesting a checkup (for various reasons I had to be checked every 6 months or so anyways) and he refused since ""in the army if it's less than 3 years I don't have to check you"", and he dismissed my pain without even looking.

A week later I was hospitalized because of a crazy case of herpes.

The nurse that was supposed to put in the cateter was busy telling me I should've used the condom and not just the pill with my boyfriend of 2 years, instead of trying to be gentle with my lady parts, which by this time were pretty much exposed raw meat and I screamed my head off every time she poked me with the cateter (hey, I know it's disgusting, but how about actually looking where you're putting it??).

Funny thing, eventually my boyfriend's test results came clean, so she was both derogatory and wrong. I still don't know why tf do I have herpes then, but it could be a lot of things (including genetics) so oh welp.

Aaaand I couldn't report her nor the retard gynecologist because soldiers don't have rights apparently and this case was dismissed by every person in charge I spoke to about it."

In this case for making her take out her piercing a) after already allowing it and b) before it has completely healed.
But in general I just wonder how bad is the relationship between you two that she'd rather get a fake id for a piercing instead of asking you/your husband. I think this is what you should be really worried about.
If she doesn't come to you in a simple case like that, she won't come for help when it's really needed... and that would be my biggest concern as a parent."

I do want to mention that the amount of stigma against herpes is absurd. For most people it's as simple as ""don't kiss me, I have a cold on my lips"" (sorry for the poor translation) - obviously still important to be aware of, but no biggie.

It doesn't only come as STD. It can be transferred genetically. You can even catch it from a dirty towel at your gym.

I have herpes, and my boyfriend doesn't, even after 5 years together - I had only one breakout really, but that one got me to be hospitalized since the lady-doctor pretty much ignored my pain...

She's clearly being ignorant of the fact that it's bothering you.

But from my experience - sexual fantasies that just *don't let go* aren't there without a reason. I'm not going to imply any specific scenario, but I feel like it was something that you two never had a **dead serious** talk about - probably just remarks of discomfort. If it was a new relationship I would suggest an ultimatum - either she solves this problem (with or without your help) or gtfo.

The next steps my doctor offered are antidepressants, which I'm a bit reluctant to take (probably because I can't accept the fact that I might be sick... don't we all think we're superman at our 20's?).

I tried asking myself why, but I always either get to a dead end. Sometimes it's a closed circle (mostly with social interactions - I don't want to interact with people, but I need to, otherwise I won't have anyone in case I want to interact with them at some point), sometimes it's a ""what's the point?"" kind of dead end. I'm thinking about going to therapy just for the sake of someone not allowing me to get away with such evasive answers.

You don't have to see your in-laws if you don't like them, no matter how good or bad they are. But comparing the situations and making a point out of it is an asshole move. She asked to not give you oral because she feels uncomfortable with it. You asked her to stop seeing her parents because she refused to perform oral sex.

&#x200B;

Do not get me wrong - if the dinners are really something you can't tolerate (I believe there is a reason she wants you with her, I doubt that she brings you with to torture you), you can and should talk about it, and refuse to go if you feel the need. But this should in no way be compared to anything on her side - not oral, not other things she dislikes, because then you make it sound like you're punishing her. This shouldn't be the point of your refusal."
