I had an ex that was an alcoholic, and the biggest issue he had was getting drunk almost every week night, being mad at me when I didn't want to be drunk with him, and literally going through withdrawals when he would quit. I guess those kinds of issues are what I was looking for in your story. What some others are saying above, getting ahead of his drinking before it becomes a problem really sounds like a good idea.  Just remember, it's not your responsibility to change him, either. He has to be willing to put in the work to better himself as well. Keep that in mind down the road if things don't seem to be improving or, God forbid, get worse. 

Best of luck!!!"
