I went back to work yesterday and unlike before the distancing, I actually felt like I had more time to do stuff in the mornings and afternoons. I just feel overall happier. Though I guess it could be because it's starting to become summer. I don't know if I've gained or lost weight but my clothes are becoming looser. I guess my diet has gotten better though."
