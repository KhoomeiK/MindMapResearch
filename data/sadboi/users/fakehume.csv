BPD,fr29xfu,t3_gm8lds,1589833662.0,"I struggle with this too. From my understanding I've pretty much had to hide from my feelings and needs in order to survive.

Here are a few steps that help me. 

First, I need to review which feelings are available https://www.cnvc.org/training/resource/feelings-inventory is a good place. Search for lists and activities and learn.

Second, by journaling I explore and review. It helps me have a better grasp. 

Thirdly, I do work on self validation and compassion. I still struggle with slipping into self loathing and self pity. It doesn't help me progress though. Please know you and your experience is equal to anyone else. I have to remind myself that human dignity is for everyone, including me.

Fourth, I have to constantly remind myself to be mindful not to push myself to go too far too fast. It only seems to trigger emotional flashbacks and then dissociation.

I don't know tbh. I hope you find what works for you. Happy to hear you are in dbt."
CPTSD,fqzrxfw,t3_gltiyb,1589773947.0,"I'm sorry you're going through this. I have it too.

>Deep down I know I can't love myself, yet I want someone to love me unconditionally.

This is what people who as children experience trauma and or don't form a secure attachment with their primary care givers feel. It becomes undeniable and forced me to stop pretending I wasn't miserable. 

A romantic relationship can't fix this problem. In fact they only made me feel worse. That's why dbt is so awesome. It helps me learn how to accept myself and my problems. It helps me to regulate my emotions. It helps me to find validation where it can only come from. Myself.   

I'm working on sobriety and dbt. I had to stop romance because I had to invoke my inner Richard Simmons and ""stop the insanity!"" 

Soon I'll be restarting some for of trauma informed therapy. 

I know this isn't the sextet of responses. But I spent so much if my life pretending I could fake it. I can't. 

It's helping. I still have a lot of work to do but I am kind of fascinated to see what I'll find in a partner when I'm not seeking validation. Validation my primary care givers didn't comprehend themselves.

One more thing, you are totally worth it. Do the work. DBT is changing the way I see myself and the world around me."
BPD,fqxp2sq,t1_fqwprnt,1589735733.0,"Me too! In fact the therapist who suggested it said ""it sounds like you're writing for an audience. That won't help. You got to give yourself permission to write the deepest, darkest secrets. That's when it's healing.""

So I would shred and burn the earliest ones. Now I just use my email drafts and I write so much and take so many damn selfies they get deleted for me. 

All jokes aside, writing out all of this shit has helped me probably more than anything. And it's free and available 24/7. It's saved my ass more times than I can count.

Try it out!"

I think routine is a concept that has helped me. We all get into routines whether we are aware of it or not.

So using core mindfulness I have been trying to build up my healthy morning. I think the start of the day I need to be aware of what my goals are and kind of get in the new perspective zone. Essentially I need to turn my back on so many of my habits that led me down.

DBT takes time. But it has already really helped me. You can do it!"
BPD,fpaa9rx,t3_gcafyy,1588443999.0,"Thanks for this. 

I struggle with the same thing. Self hate does not help me feel or act any better. Self hate doesn't get me into dbt sessions when I'd rather hide and wallow in self pity."
BPD,fpa9zw1,t3_gcagq8,1588443834.0,"Finding a good therapist is hard. Finding one that you have the therapeutic alliance with is even harder.

I forgot to add this r/dbtselfhelp/

Glad to hear you're familiar with dbt. It's truly a learned skill like ballet or martial arts (which are also good for you btw! Hahaha). Learning the concepts, listening to others in my groups about how they use them to manage their emotions and problems and relationships really has helped me. 

I used to have this attitude that I was so unique no one would understand me. But now that I'm older I can relate so much more even if my experiences weren't exactly the same. 

I think dbt and journaling have helped me calm down more than anything else."
aspergers,fpa7t9o,t3_gc2kbg,1588442558.0,"First off, take a deep breath. It's OK to want to do everything perfectly. It's OK to make mistakes. 

I have the mind blindness thing. I can blank out. I learned about stress and how different environments and different people can impact both my performance and productivity.

See if you can take some workshops or classes or a therapist to help with test anxiety. That may be a big part of your issue. Sometimes we get so caught up in trying to prove ourselves we end up sabotaging our performance. 

Just my two cents."
offmychest,fokr4hs,t3_g80tqx,1587847347.0,"Stoked you're still with us man! Funny how life works.

Hey, see if you can sign up for a DBT group. It really helps me manage my emotions. The lows aren't as low.

See if you can sign up for DBT a type of therapy that focuses on teaching emotional regulation though learned skills and techniques. It helped me so much."

BPD,fohbotj,t1_fohas4o,1587763287.0,"YouTube Marsha Linehan (the creator of dbt) and check out r/dbtselfstudy. It takes time and patience but will really help with this classic bpd issue. 

May I suggest you find a regular dbt group too. One on one is better than nothing though. I found that hearing others discuss their problems and implementation of various skills really helped me to better understand it. Theory is one thing but witnessing it's impact from your peers is so helpful.

You're going to be fine either way buddy. And you can use radical acceptance right now by saying ""it is what it is"" and letting it go. There's someone probably way better waiting for you in the future. But maybe take a break and begin to realize that you really don't need anyone on such a desperate level."
BPD,fohamum,t3_g7g5xj,1587762791.0,"1. Start studying DBT. Radical Acceptance will help.

2. Read the AA Big Book:

>Page 417 Acceptance
A.A. Big Book â€“ Acceptance is the answer to ALL of my problems today. When I am disturbed, it is because I find some person, place, thing or situation- some fact of my life- unacceptable to me, and I can find no serenity until I accept that person, place, thing, or situation as being exactly the way it is supposed to be at this moment. Nothing, absolutely nothing, happens in God's world by mistake. Until I could accept my alcoholism, I could not stay sober; unless I accept my life completely on life's terms, I cannot be happy. I need to concentrate not so much on what needs to be changed in the world as on what needs to be changed in me and in my attitudes"

Maybe cross off doing big dick porn from your bucket list. Or rebrand it as a clitoris on a stick! Hahaha. Honestly, lay off the porn and start making friends with women and you'll be fine.

PS I forgot this other point: millions of lesbians can't be wrong!"
