I also firmly believe their content is better now than it was in the old days. It seems like they genuinely have fun and love doing what they do, while in the past it felt like it was a job they did because they had to (Ray hating Minecraft and hardly trying towards the end of his time, Jack getting upset in damn near every game because of his competitiveness, people complaining about having to do recordings in whatever game). 

On top of that, the video editing is light years better than it used to be and they have a more diverse cast so its not the same people in every video which helps keep things fresh. 

Sure there are hilarious classic moments and videos, but I feel overall AH is in a way better place and many people remember/view the past through rose colored glasses.
