2.Someone who isn’t exclusively attracted to one particular gender -Oxford Languages

3.Attraction to people of any sex or gender identity, also known as pansexuality -Wikipedia

my mother had a very hard pregnancy and birth for my brother and myself. for me, she was stuck in the hospital for around 2 months before giving birth. i (as a newborn) had to stay in the hospital for 3 months. 
i also hate pregnancy with a passion. the entire thing is gross to me, the fact that the baby can make my bones brittle and make my teeth fall out- no, no, no. 
i don’t even want to think about the stomach becoming larger. bleh.
