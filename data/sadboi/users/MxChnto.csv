Dreams,fq28d3y,t1_fq25ggk,1589053752.0,"In myths, sleep paralysis is caused by demons when they sit on your chest. Thats why you couldn’t move although you know you’re awake.

Scientifically, it is when you lose muscle control while you’re in REM. Some people hallucinate which explains why they see demons or shadows.

This is based on what Ive read before. Correct me if I’m wrong or if I’ve missed some points."
