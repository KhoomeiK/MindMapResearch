The original post was taken down by auto mod, because it was reported by another user for low effort rambling. On big subreddits they use auto mods to automatically remove reported posts pending approval by a mod who can either leave it deleted or approve it and make it visible again. That’s because the mods receive a lot of reports and can’t get to them immediately, and rather than have posts on the sub that break the rules, they have them removed to be approved again later so that the sub isn’t littered by rule breaking content. The original post by primary was approved and made visible again by a mod.

Now let’s get to your argument, a very, very weak comparison. It is in no way like letting a dog off a leash. A domesticated dog will only attack if provoked or trained to or looked after in such a way as to make it aggressive and trigger happy. A dog is not like a human being. A human being has deeper intelligent thought. Your comparison is a logical fallacy, not the only fallace in this thread if youll pardon the pun. The current police force system is good in my opinion, it allocated funding to each force and allows them to decide what it is best used for in their region. The actions of police in the Sheffield shouldn’t be decided by a group of people in London who have never been to Sheffield should they. The responsibility was transferred to people that know the area better and can better fulfil the needs and requirement of such areas. Just because certain areas have failed to do this and opted to sit on their arses and arrest people for calling someone fat online instead of combatting knife crime. That’s not the Tories fault.

You also fail to realise there have been three different Tory governments since 2012; Cameron’s Administration, Mays administration and Johnson’s administration. They bring in different cabinet members and different forms of Toryism.

I live in the UK. We do not let all police officers use deadly force. We have a massive knife crime problem that is constantly on the rise. Children carry ten inch knives around to act hard, and many end up using them. Adults are no better. 

The only police officers that can carry guns are firearms officers. They have years of expierience, train with various guns for 40 hours a month and have been through extensive training. Guess what. They react to knives in the same way. Several shots in the chest. It’s the only time anything actually gets done about knofe crime. Tasers dont work and end up with dead cops"
JusticeServed,fq07dws,t1_fq0133m,1589028458.0,"Ok let’s break that down.

I understand where you’re coming from with the shoot his legs line of argument, you’re human, you don’t like hearing about people getting shot, it’s natural, I don’t like it either but:

1) This is an incredibly high stress situation. The adrenaline the police officer is feeling will be absolutely aim destroying. Unless he has served or been involved in many life endangering situations, the chances the adrenaline is severely going to affect his ability to think. The reason soldiers know what to do under that kind of pressure is because they go on training exercises for three months before they deploy (in the UK at least) and have been training for a long time, so instinct kicks in. They also don’t have to think about where to aim, just point and shoot.

2) The legs and knees are extremely small targets compared to the torso and chest. They also move differently to the chest. When running your legs obviously move a lot, making them even harder to aim at, whilst your chest will only slightly rotate. This makes the legs very hard to hit, add in the pressure and consequences of the situation and they’re almost impossible to hit.

3) Even if you did manage to hit them in the legs, they may not stop. The man with the knife is not responding so is most likely on drugs or mentally ill, so he may not feel the pain of the wound due to the drugs. The thing that stops you in your tracks and is most deadly when you initially get shot is shock. Obviously blood loss is the overall deadliest aspect but if you can’t calm down you won’t need to worry about blood loss. If he’s on drugs or mentally unstable he may not go into shock.

These are just a few reasons, i can think of more but I don’t think that’s necessary."
