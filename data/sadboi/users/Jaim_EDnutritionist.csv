EatingDisorders,fmxbl36,t3_fxex8n,1586461984.0,"Hello, 

I am an eating disorder nutritionist and I presently have a client who suffers from Chew and Spit disorder. There's still little information out there of its effects on health but some studies suggest that this repeated mechanism on the long term could stimulate the release of certain hormones such as insulin which could increase the storage of the foods that one person eats. 

The way I approach the treatment for this disorder is to compare it to bulimia where the most common compensatory mechanism is vomiting. The first thing is to realize how damaging the  compensatory mechanism is. In your case, the repeated chewing and spitting could lead to malnourishment, macronutrients and vitamins deficiencies, dental problems ad swelling of the salivary glands. 

While it may seem satisfactory to the taste buds to be able to chew the food, in reality we are not 100% satisfied. You would therefore need to chew and spit a greater amount of foods compared to swallowing the food without any guilt. This can be of course very tricky and difficult to do. 

You may have many forbidden foods, foods that you fear of swallowing because of the belief that they might be too high in calories, fat or sugar. The key is to work with an ED specialist to help you demystify any food beliefs that you might and helps you with the gradual exposure of the forbidden foods so that you are able to eat them mindfully with no guilt and without losing control. 

Try not to be too harsh on yourself after an episode of chewing and spitting. Try to practice self-compassion. The guiltier you feel after an episode, the more you will need to chew and spit in an attempt to numb those negative feelings.

Take care!"
EatingDisorders,fld6ti1,t3_fnw6sr,1585057987.0,"As an ED nutritionist, my advice to you would first try to dissociate yourself from the ED. Tracking your calories is helpful for your ED not to you. Try to recognize that calorie counting is a factor maintaining the ED. 

Also try to reverse roles...if your friend told you that she feels guilty/ashamed when she's hungry, what you would tell her? Try applying the same advice you would have said to that friend. Be a friend to yourself :)"
EatingDisorders,fkuqyln,t3_fkfeqg,1584554495.0,"As an ED nutritionist, I acknowledge that this is a very challenging time for many people suffering from ED or disordered eating. It is a time of many unknowns and uncertainty. I think it's important to validate and accept that you feel anxious and stressed and to give yourself permission to eat your emotions. It is important to be compassionate and gentle towards yourself because if food guilt and shame are present, it might trigger even more binge eating episodes. 

Try to do activities that do make you feel better too (listening to music, meditation, going for a walk while practicing social distancing, etc.)

Also try not to listen to the news all the time. Give yourself a break from the media from time to time. 

If you are at home, try to maintain the same meal and snack that you usually have when you are not at home. 

And rely on your support system to let them know how you feel and don't hesitate to ask for help if you need. I am not sure where you live but in many countries there are phone lines you could call to talk to get help :) Sending much love to you!"

From what I'm reading in your post, it seems like you've tried to listen to your hunger but how are you feeling after eating? Satisfied or is there a bit of guilt? If there is a bit of guilt about the food you ate, the portion or the frequency you ate the food, then may be you will still be craving for more. It's hard to get rid completely of food guilt and shame, especially if it's been present for a long time. Try to give yourself time, indulgence and compassion for yourself in this journey :)"
