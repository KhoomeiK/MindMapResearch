depression,fk9dxkv,t3_fh565g,1583974097.0,Lol and then they get all freaked out because they were hoping you‚Äôd say yes.
CrossStitch,fcjaugn,t1_fcja78d,1577681641.0,I just typed in wooden cross stitch frames. They have all different shapes and variety packs for pretty cheap!
CrossStitch,fcjaj02,t1_fci5jx8,1577681394.0,Thank you!
CrossStitch,fcjaijn,t1_fcj4sl5,1577681384.0,It probably took about 15 hours give or take. Plus the washing and it has a felt backing on it. It was much bigger than I was expecting it to be.
CrossStitch,fcja0vn,t1_fcirref,1577681010.0,Thank you so much ‚ò∫Ô∏è
CrossStitch,fcja03z,t1_fciu25d,1577680995.0,They are actually these awesome soft plastic frames off amazon. I love how fancy they look.
CrossStitch,fcg87ck,t3_eh7ybk,1577637479.0,Design by Threedy on Etsy :)
BostonTerrier,f1dcq81,t3_d8wd3i,1569380021.0,I think you‚Äôre pretty! üòª
AskReddit,ez2flzs,t1_ez0ndol,1567655235.0,I get What I call a ‚Äúdairy hangover‚Äù because sometimes you just gotta eat that ice cream before bed and the next day I wake up feeling like shit. It hits me harder than actual alcohol.
euphoria,exs6g7g,t3_cu6iwz,1566533799.0,I listen to this song all day. Most of the soundtrack is amazing too. My friends have been subjected to it for weeks
thousandoaks,excjsdl,t3_crvpax,1566152404.0,"Thousand Oaks is actually a really great area. Kinda boring if you‚Äôre a single adult but awesome if you have kids. There are beautiful parks and hiking trails, awesome schools and tons of activities and things geared towards kids and families. They just built a dojo boom and a Dave and busters too. Also pretty much everywhere in Thousand Oaks is a nice area, I‚Äôve lived here for a long time and I can‚Äôt think of anywhere that‚Äôs  not pretty lovely to live in.
The worst thing is probably the traffic on the 101 but it‚Äôs mostly a small pocket you can get around using side streets"
KidsAreFuckingStupid,ex11n9p,t1_ex0jeje,1565927940.0,"As someone in the same profession I second, third and fourth this! How much do you want to laugh when you ask how often they floss and they say everyday but their gums bleed as soon as you look at them."
frogdogs,evxmz7v,t3_clqe5b,1564898449.0,I love your tattoo! And your dogs super cute face. I have a Boston and I‚Äôm looking to get his little mug tattooed on my arm soon :)
starterpacks,eum92es,t1_euleqzz,1563912758.0,Probably because there wasn‚Äôt enough room in the mouth. Orthodontists have ya pull teeth to make room for the adult teeth to grow in straight. It‚Äôs not fun but also prevents you from looking like an inbred hillbilly.
starterpacks,eum8v3m,t3_cgt5kh,1563912691.0,But really.. if You just floss your goddamn teeth it would save you everyone so much trouble!!
marvelmemes,eufnht8,t3_cg5es3,1563782170.0,"I went three times but I also bought tickets using my movie pass which gives me three movies a week. I can‚Äôt see all the movies but I can use it to purchase a ticket to see avengers every week since it‚Äôs come out, even if I can‚Äôt go to the theater, they still get the money for the ticket. We all must do our part."
BostonTerrier,euexcco,t3_cg05z3,1563756568.0,Omg I have Boston next to me but I immediately need another one. That face! üòç

Fleabag,et797rh,t3_caaia6,1562527234.0,Not exactly similar but Good Omens has great writing and acting with tons of dark British humor. Watched it right after fleabag and it does not disappoint.
Fleabag,esq6b3x,t1_espoqva,1562196377.0,Oh man so good!! All the feelings from watching it just came back. Is there an onion in this room?? üò≠
Fleabag,esmvwpt,t3_c8d2mx,1562116173.0,Yes please and thank you.
Fleabag,ermamrj,t3_c2qmii,1561012852.0,I‚Äôve never wanted someone to yell at me more than him.
CasualConversation,erd3edk,t3_c1d2em,1560729701.0,"My dad always picks up the phone. Whether it be 3am or the middle of a busy work day. Even as an adult he is still always there for me and now my husband whenever we need him. Whether it‚Äôs to come fix our washing machine or to come to the hospital when I was sick. He always has time for us. It‚Äôs really a miracle when I think about how strapped for time I am simply for myself. He‚Äôs a true hero in my eyes. He  has the most incredible work ethic I‚Äôve ever seen. We call him the shark because he never stops moving. He‚Äôs always cleaning and building things. One time he drove an hour to my apt just to fish my ring out of the sink pipe. 

He‚Äôs also does this thing where he complains about something but secretly loves it. He used to complain about watching my dogs when I needed him to. I‚Äôm reality he‚Äôs obsessed with them and treats them like little princes. They get spoiled at his house and he constantly asks when I can bring them over."
BostonTerrier,er760dn,t3_c0qiob,1560568122.0,Yes he sucks on the corners of toys and gets them and the couch soaked in the process. Soggy toys everywhere!
wedding,eqtav3x,t3_bz4zxi,1560307070.0,I wore maroon converse at my wedding. You couldn‚Äôt see my shoes under my dress and if I‚Äôm gonna have to stand all night and dance I want to be comfortable. Plus they matched the theme and were super adorable. To me there are no set rules you have to follow. It‚Äôs your day do what you want!
unpopularopinion,eq5ch63,t3_bx45ae,1559797579.0,"My dogs give me so much more than just affection. They help me wake up and get out of bed, whether it‚Äôs by jumping up on the bed or by needing to go outside. They help me get exercise because they are active dogs that need to be walked or run every single day. They make me laugh because they are too smart and try to mimic certain things that I do. All that being said they are excellent at giving affections and keeping me company when I‚Äôm feeling lonely as they are seriously cute as fuck. Bonus points because they will lay up against me when I‚Äôm cold to keep me warm as they are both space heaters. Way worth every cent I spend on them and the mere minutes I have to spend picking up their poop. Owning these dogs is the best thing that I‚Äôve ever done."
Fleabag,eq588cy,t3_bxbikc,1559794881.0,I know! I can‚Äôt stop telling people about it. It‚Äôs so magnetic I loved it. The acting and writing were phenomenal. After weeks of pestering my best friend I get a 2am text saying... ‚Äúomg is she going to have sex with the priest??‚Äù She‚Äôs hooked now too.
MasterReturns,eohjdnb,t3_brx9s8,1558583138.0,All them happy greeting snortles are the best
Fleabag,eohiz18,t3_brx7l1,1558582812.0,Yes I watched the second season again for the third time hoping that it would magically happen upon my rewatch. Maybe if I watch it a 4th time....? As a non-religious person it was definitely hard for me to understand why he would stick with the clergy even though he clearly loved her. I‚Äôm still just so sad!
LifeProTips,eoge3rc,t3_brsjfl,1558556111.0,My dog freaks out when I dance and barks super loud. The he leaps straight for me. Is my dancing that bad?
