It's all just a theory though. But I think it's TRUE to some extent. 

And that BULLSHIT  that your healthier because of a group setting, idk what that was about because I always felt way more lonely going to a place with lost of people in whom I could only have 5 min small talk with before and after we all just listen to one guy ramble. 

Seriously, when I was Christian I felt so loney I stopped going to church because it made things worse. 

At least when I was physically alone there was a reason of ""I'm actually physically alone"". 

But when I was in church I felt lonely because I saw all these people that I was unable to ever have any intimate deep long term relationships with. 

And they would say ""get intimate, share with people"" okay that NEVER brought me closer. That only caused gossip and I believe some pastors want gossip going on so that they know who to single out and ""keep an eye on"".

Usually they would only test the brain while ""in action"" of an orgasm. Or an MRI while critically thinking. 

I'm wondering about long term, does orgasms help create new brain cells in any way thus making people either critically think better or possibly some other thing might happen other than critically thinking depending on what portion of the brain might possibly be effected by orgasms (what portion grows new cells - if the brain grows new ones at all from orgasms).

A CULT-ure. 

I sounded like an idot as a Christian. And reading other Christians stuff online just pressured me to write as well. Even when I was a Christian I often would take the stuff down after posting because I would be embarrassed knowing how rediclous it would sound to non-Christians. 

Before my last deconversion I was in Christian culture and left and then went back so it was easy to see both points of views and sides. 

My last deconversion was mindful and thought through. 

The first one was more like a ""fade out"" because I just slowly stopped being Christian because of school and other things. 

Anyway an atheist or non Christians would think its abusive and psychologically damaging to send your kids into the ""wilderness"" and would never write such things. 

Christian's however, have been psychologically abused (possibly) themselves with ""lessons"" like this ""leaving you in the wilderness type thing"". So they don't always know how wrong it is to think of doing that to your kids. 

Anyway I hope she gets help other than christianity for anxiety. And it doesn't have to be pills, its just theres a lot of psychological help out there, not even just therapy but techniques. Christian's usually reject these techniques because they are not Christian per-say (or however that's spelled sorry). 

It bothers me that Christians reject outside help for anxiety.
