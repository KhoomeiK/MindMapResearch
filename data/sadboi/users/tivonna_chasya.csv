I won’t hold it against my family for having problems. It’s when they threaten me or ruin my ability to just be that I’ve had to step away. 
Always willing to forgive but I’m not forgetting this one. Need to keep my little guy away from that.

Social worker said “this home is too nice for any abuse to be going on.”  My siblings were pissed because they thought they would get taken. 
All I wanted to do was make the teen next door stop forcing me to have sex with him cause he knew my parents would not believe me. Stalked me always. I said to a friend “my parents are going to kick the shit out of me.” Teacher overheard. 
Guess what? My parents did not believe me. I suffered while that POS got to live his life."

Why I really want the rival gang to have like a chicken mascot/door guard that hates them is beyond me. 
If they kill it, the rival gang should have some buffs for being enraged. 

Also a band of girls looking for work that steal from them but make it look like the rivals...."

ffxiv,erasvae,t3_c0zjfc,1560652123.0,"1.0 was terrible and it’s a waste of time to “play” through. There were interesting aspects. 
Played alpha and beta. 
Instances had queues as in get in line. Like Gridania? Well those 15+ people are standing in line to complete the instance that is clogged. 
Need gear repaired....better do it yourself or start begging.
Side quests? What’s a side quest?
Levequest and main quest. That is it. 
Want to level? When you run out of levequests, run fates until you die of boredom. 
Want to buy something? Start walking through long halls of retainers who may or may not have hinting names like “cloth stuff” or “gear man”
You want to play one class??? No no silly. You need to level them all and very specifically to get skills so you can be useful in any way. 
Dungeons? No no. Just areas with different levequests. (Some of these could be fun)
Npcs you can talk to? Psshhh who needs those when you have the levequest giver?
You want dyed gear? Silly no you needed to dye all of the materials first. 
Oh don’t forget to repair you sex and race specific undergarments. 

I stopped just before the “mogle King” came....I don’t think people know what they are asking for wanting 1.0."
