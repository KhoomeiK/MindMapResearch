1. I have generalized anxiety disorder with panic attacks along with bipolar disorder and autism.  This is not a good combination, and as you can imagine, I can get very overwhelmed (although pretty much anyone would feel overwhelmed in the situation you described).  I've found the best thing I can do is to take deep breaths to slow down my heart rate and everything.  Then, I focus on the immediate task at hand, not looking too far into what I need to do in the future.  Also, when we feel overwhelmed, we are mainly using the emotional parts of our brains.  We can switch to the logical part pretty quickly by recalling something objective.  When I feel overwhelmed, I think of my home address, and then I can focus better.  

2. Okay, to be frank, what you described sounds like a really toxic situation for you to be in.  From what I understand, you were told to do a bunch of tasks at once without the equipment to do them.  Then, when a manager who wasn't even busy saw you, he or she gave you a write-up for not doing a bunch of things at once that was likely impossible to do well.  I agree with the other user: this manager needs to be reported.  I would also recommend looking for some local jobs that you might like better.  Ones that pay more and are known for having good management, and, most importantly, ones that make you feel good, dying to work the next day once your shift ends.  I did this, and it didnt work out, but it did result in my operator making me an insane offer to come back.  You never know..."

You see, when a business becomes incorporated, it becomes its own legal entity, meaning that it is, in the eyes of the law, its own person. This means you dont sue the CEO: you sue the business itself.  And the CEO doesnt go into debt: the business does.  So people high up in a company can make a lot of money using incorporations that are actually very weak and can die from losing profit for only a few weeks.

twilight,fjx9wwt,t3_fex6dg,1583663894.0,"*Twilight spoilers of all books*

I remember Bella talking about how she wants to have some experiences as a human first, such as sex.  And of course Edward thinks very little of himself and who he is, so he doesn't want to turn the one he loves so much into a ""monster"" like himself.  The only other Cullen who is opposed is Rosalie because she wishes she could be human again and feels like she had her life ripped away from her (and she truly did): her backstory is truly horrific.

To answer your question, Bella would have been protected from all vampire attacks on her, and Renesmee would have never been born.  So I suppose it would have mixed results.  In any case, Bella's humanity is the cause of the conflicts in all four books, so she would theoretically just live happily ever after with Edward but without their daughter."

It is important to note that the vast majority of our thinking occurs subconsciously.  For this reason, even though we believe they mean well on the surface, we might have a lot of different thoughts about the situation occurring below the surface.  Maybe we feel a little rejected by someone important whenever this situation occurs, even if we don't consciously realize this.  One can never truly be sure, as psychology is a really crazy science (which used to not even be so objective), but what we do know is that we have an innate behavior that we hope to change.  

I have some advice as to how to go about working on this, but I don't want to write it here because I'm worried it might minimize what you're going through.

needadvice,fek3cix,t3_epdtks,1579191735.0,"The only way to cope with a fear that I've studied is exposure therapy.  I know that sounds ridiculous for death, but I can actually think of some things you can do.  

Here are the general steps:

1. Identify the fear you'd like to confront.  

2. Create a list of things you can do (pertaining to the fear) in order from easiest to most uncomfortable.

3. Start going through the list.  Do each item until you feel no discomfort doing it.  Then move on to the next.

So for your fear of death, some things I can think of for the list would be attending funerals, reading obituaries of people who died peacefully in old age, looking into some theories of what happens after death, visiting a store selling headstones and coffins, watching fake deaths in movies (maybe even war movies when you work up to it or The Hunger Games), and writing a will.  These are in no particular order, and you should organize them in order of how far each one is out of your comfort zone. And of course, add your own!

I hope this helps a bit :)"

Rapekink,feh4ueb,t3_enokpl,1579109173.0,"There is no difference.  Someone who is significantly intoxicated does not have the capacity to offer informed consent, so having sex with that person or performing any sexual acts, even if that person verbally offers consent in his or her drunken state, is rape.  The only exception is if both parties are intoxicated to the same level because then nobody has the mental capacity to take advantage of the other party.

The exception to this is if they have discussed this prior and the intoxicated party has stated that it is okay to perform sexual acts with him or her while he or she is intoxicated.  This would be a form of CNC."

SNHU,feagop2,t3_eo8tcd,1578948562.0,"I'm pretty good with reading on the computer, although I wear prescription glasses, which have blue light protection.  I also generally watch YouTube lectures instead of reading whenever I can find one, just using the book to help me with assignments.  

Nothing wrong with buying physical books, as long as you still have access to the work and such (sometimes access to the sites where homework and quizzes are taken is included with the ebook.)

If you do choose the physical book route, I recommend renting through Amazon.  When you rent a book there, if you choose to buy it later on, the money you paid to rent it is directly taken off the purchase price.  Otherwise, they have postage you can print off when the rental is up, so you can just put it in a mailer and take it to the nearest post office at the end of the term.  I've done it once, and it saved me a lot of money."

DebatePolitics,fe9r4hv,t3_e5lunz,1578940764.0,"I'm not the biggest fan of him.  I dont think he's another Hitler like many of my friends, but he just generally doesn't show much foresight, and he acts really immature.  

The biggest eye-opener for me was his reform of the Affordable Care Act, which took out the clause that made it mandatory.  I wasn't a huge fan of the act to begin with because it covered so much, but when he took out that clause, he made the bill completely worthless.  The whole idea was that young, healthy people would be forced to be able to pay for the medical bills  of older people.  But if they aren't legally required to, what young person is going to pay enormous monthly premiums for insurance they hardly ever use since they are generally healthy? 

Then there is his insulting of people.  Calling people names accomplishes nothing and is an immature outlet of anger.  Like when he called Kim ""Rocket Boy"" before the summit.  He's just needlessly antagonizing people who could help him and his cause, and, more importantly, this country."
lonely,fe9nmey,t3_eo73e3,1578939803.0,"I am a firm believer that there is someone in this world for anyone who wants a partner: many people just haven't found that person yet.

The notion that one is too ugly for anyone to want him or her doesn't  make sense because nobody, and I mean NOBODY is ugly.  As a pansexual person, I have found that, even with people I don't find attractive initially, they become increasingly physically attractive as my romantic attraction for them grows.  I have a friend with the same thing going on.  So for a large population, physical attractiveness isn't even a factor that we consider in choosing whether to give someone a chance."

It took me months to realize that, while I did mess up a lot, nothing I did gave her no choice but to leave.  I did not end the relationship: she did.  I think I just liked to blame it on myself because a) I held her in some higher, infallible place and b) it made me feel like I could somehow prevent people from leaving in the future, if I just learned from whatever mistake I made to cause her to leave.  But it wasn't my fault, and maybe it wasn't her fault either.  I don't know, and I don't care at this point because what difference does it make?"
BreakUps,fe62xux,t3_edlfw0,1578880592.0,"Hey, thank you for posting.  People say that seeing other's exes come back gives them false hope, but there's nothing false about it.  If we firmly believe our exes will come back soon, we're  lying to ourselves, as we can't predict that.  But if we tell ourselves that we know for sure they're gone for good, that's  also a form of lying to ourselves because we can't know that, either.

While you have never directly harmed a child, you have watched some content on the dark web, which you sincerely regret and have since stopped.  You think you will only get worse, while your track record shows you only getting better.  You realized it was wrong and quit.  You are stronger than your desires, and I know you can get through the rest of your life never harming a child, nor watching content involving this.  

You messed up in the past, but you truly feel remorse for it, and you have stopped.  We all mess up.  It's what we do after that really matters.  

It is also really important for you to know that having such desires hurts nobody.  As long as you have the will-power to never act on them, you can live a productive, fulfilling life, just like anyone else.  Never harming anyone."
