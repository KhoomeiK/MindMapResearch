I was told this when I quit 3 or 4 times ago.  ""Don't have the first one and you'll never be a smoker again"".  I didn't believe it.  I have willpower, I thought.  They taste horrible.  I'll have one once in a great while.  Next thing I knew I was buying a pack.  It happens quick.  You would think you could just stop once you realize that you're smoking again but it's way harder than when you first quit.  You end up smoking for a while, for me it was a year or two, until you get the motivation to quit again.

The best advice I can give you is not to try ""cutting down"" to quit.  I don't know anyone who's quit by reducing how much they smoke over time, and I knew a shit ton of smokers and most of them tried this way at least once.  Pick a quit date, maybe even today, and don't have a cigarette ever again.

Then, keep never having a cigarette.  If you have one cigarette, even after a year or two, you will probably become a smoker again.  There's a tiny chance you won't, but trust me, you most likely will.  EVERYBODY thinks they are the one who can have one cig here and there.  You can't."

It's to slow down the spread so hospitals are not overwhelmed and doctors don't  have to make choices on who to put on a ventilator and who to let die because there are not enough ventilators.

The faster it spreads through our country the faster we can get back to normal.  The more people that have had it, the more people can no longer spread it.
