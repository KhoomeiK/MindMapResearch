BlackPeopleTwitter,f5dnl6q,t1_f5cocou,1572156576.0,"I would suggest going to an lgbtq event. When I say space it just means where people hangout or gather.
You can find some in your area by searching online. meetup is a good place to start.

Before you go, I would suggest you do some research so that you not only know what you‚Äôre stepping into but also so you can go there with the intention to be as kind to the ppl there as you want the ppl there to be to you. In my experience, I feel most at home in these places because it‚Äôs judgment free and very loving."
