depression,fosfqlb,t1_fosfokq,1588029827.0,I feel like that on a daily basis but i have no idea how to describe it

depression,f31ze6z,t3_df57ej,1570588892.0,i'm 16
depression,f25n3jm,t3_dc31q3,1569978721.0,"i know how you feel i don't know if this'll really help but although i still have depression i have kind of come to terms with the meaningless of life (in terms of view and outlook on life i'm a realist and have a more pessimistic view of things and  in terms of philosophy i'm definitely nihilist and atheist) i know it isn't that easy to just 'deal with it' but i mean there's nothing i can really do about i'm gonna die i know that and everyone i know will die at some point, that's just life really, even if i wanted to not think that, what can you do about it?

imo it's probably best to accept the futility of existence and just live each day not knowing when you die and being okay with that. Because it does help a little bit.

But if you don't want to do that my advice would be to try and find a way of filling that void (i don't mean alcohol and substance abuse) i mean trying to focus on what you love like being with those you care about or find a hobby you like, other than that i don't really know.

Hope this helps. Good luck."
depression,f25mj0a,t3_dbt5ps,1569978306.0,yeah i know exactly how you feel happens to me almost everytime i'm with my friends it's especially difficult because most of them have known each other for most of their lives. so that isolation does make it hard to join in conversations so i usually try to join in but usually stay quiet and space out.
depression,f1hhv4i,t3_d9f2m4,1569493816.0,Same i can hardly tell if i’m actually depressed or i’m faking it so well i’ve fooled myself
depression,f1hhs25,t3_d9crb8,1569493761.0,As soon as i’m able to i will do exactly that so then when i die nobody will miss me
depression,f1gi9vo,t3_d9djqm,1569467878.0,Nah its good even though i cant do it at least thinking it out and planning it may provide some help or maybe pass the time until i get tired and sleep and hopefully never wake up again
depression,f1gi1v5,t3_d9djqm,1569467739.0,Sounds good i cant though cos i’m only a 16 year old but i think maybe jumping in front of a train might do it or maybe laying down with my neck on the tracks so it ensures decapitation maybe?
depression,f1ghs6v,t3_d9djqm,1569467566.0,Yeah when i did it i pointed a knife at my throat ready to plunge it into my throat but i held back. Sometimes i wish i’d gone through with it.but if i got a hold of a gun i’d try again. But likely fail to pull the trigger.
depression,f1gg9vc,t3_d9dpp4,1569466649.0,Same but its almost every day. When i’m with my friends i’m in a somewhat better mood but they got lives of their own and i don’t wanna bother them and even then its temporary so i just keep going through the day just waiting until i die i’ve not got any plans on what i’ll do after leaving school (i’m 16). When death comes for me i’ll finally be done with this fucking shit
depression,f1gfoyx,t3_d9dmls,1569466304.0,Thanks for the wise words man. I envy your luck
depression,f1gfgv5,t3_d9djqm,1569466170.0,"Same here. I just feel empty like i’m essentially dead but my organs are still working and i’m still breathing. I just want to die, i dont even really care how (not suicide though i tried and got soooo close but i stopped realising how my family would take it) whether i’m murdered killed in an accident or fucking get a brain aneurysm i just want something to end me"
depression,f1gey78,t3_d9d9ph,1569465867.0,"I mean yeah it sounds nice cos there’s no sadness, no fear, no anger, no happiness it’s just nothing i no longer am afraid of dying i mean obviously if i was scared or dying slowly of course the human desire to survive would take over but still i no longer even feel alive. I’m just waiting until my inevitable death whatever the cause."
depression,f1genlk,t3_d9d9xu,1569465686.0,I know how you feel i almost “left” myself too but i stopped myself because of how itd affect my family and my few friends. That was 3 years ago. Now i’m just waiting until my parents die or i become old enough to live on my own and then isolate myself from everyone and then ”leave” but until then i’m gonna remain the apathetic shithead i am and hope to die in an accident or “leave”
depression_memes,f1ge6b6,t1_f170anf,1569465404.0,Same its what helps me get through each day while i wait to die
depression_memes,f1gdsw7,t3_d8f64u,1569465184.0,Fuck it i’ve been holding out too much id take just to finally end my worthless fucking existence
depression,f16wi0w,t3_d7ul80,1569226805.0,Yeah i wanna get better but part of me wants to stay depressed because i have nothing else going for me except that i’m the depressed kid
depression,f16wewt,t3_d81tak,1569226707.0,Same i almost did but i didnt out of fear of dying but also of how those in my life would react too
depression,f16wcwl,t3_d7sr0g,1569226640.0,Honestly i see what you mean i’m just waiting until either they die or i die through some kind of accident or something. The fact that they’d be miserable is what stopped me when i almost killed myself. Sometimes i think that it was a good thing but also i think that i got so close to ending myself and i feel dumb for not going through with it

(Here's to hoping things get better or not idk) 

but yeah i'll try to take up your advice thanks"
teenagers,et8gfqy,t3_cafrwi,1562555760.0,"idk if this will help but for me what helps is just realizing it's gonna happen at some point so don't worry about it too much, cos what happens, happens (it only  kinda helps tho)"
teenagers,et8g9xw,t1_et8g1ez,1562555631.0,"honestly the fact i got a good life (upper-middle class family, parents still married, go to a good private school, and have some close friends who i can count on to lift my spirits if i get down) just adds to the fire, it makes me think that i shouldn't be thinking the way i am and i'm just some whiny bitch for being depressed when there are people around the world who have it WAY harder than i do."

teenagers,et8fi05,t1_et8f2hu,1562555037.0,"yeah i can say for me at least it doesn't get cured with help it just gets easier to deal with, there are still times where i just want to die, i mean when i thought i recovered from depression completely a couple months after my first and only depressive episode a few years back and then i'm holding a knife to my throat and genuinely considering to do it right then and there, luckily  i managed to stop myself by thinking of how it'd affect my parents (which is usually how i fight off my suicidal thoughts but there are times where even doing that doesn't help and i think i'm a fucking coward for trying to not do it.  

&#x200B;

basically what i mean is depression isn't as simple as others think, it doesn't really go away it just gets weaker"
teenagers,et8exzd,t1_et8eu2k,1562554606.0,"yeah it does i think the main problem is people just view depression as being really sad, when it's much much more than that."
teenagers,et8elgn,t3_cafiiy,1562554329.0,"yeah it's annoying because you sometimes doubt if you're actually depressed or just overreacting and it makes you feel worse, although making self-deprecating jokes or depression jokes kinda help me a bit as i usually try and hide it as to not worry my family and friends too much.

(also i'm currently not in a major depressive episode rn so don't worry, though i have a slight suspicion i may be entering into one tho)"

teenagers,et5p0ji,t1_et5ouho,1562482610.0,i mean i got lucky in that i chose to get help and didn't go too far down the rabbit hole  ( i mean like self-harm or attempting suicide) it's better to find out early (not too early) because it'll be harder. and getting the help will feel like a huge weight is lifted off of your shoulders. i mean i still get suicidal thoughts now and then but it's a lot better now than it was  back then.
teenagers,et5ouho,t3_ca403l,1562482393.0,"i mean you might as well, because when i was beginning my first and only (thankfully) depressive episode back in year 6 i had no idea if i was actually depressed or was overthinking it, besides if it turns out you do have depression you'd be given proper therapy which would help prevent you going further into it and what's the worst that could happen if it turns out you don't?"
