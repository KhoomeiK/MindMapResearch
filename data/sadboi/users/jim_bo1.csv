Anxiety,folzm9t,t3_g8414i,1587874367.0,Literally just got out of the ER because I was genuinely convinced I was having a heart attack. Turns out my arm/chest pain had nothing to do with my heart and I just had a panic attack. I’m thankful that I’m okay but I I feel pretty embarrassed.

But I see I have a lot more to learn about digital art and art in general that’s for sure lol"
AnimalCrossingNewHor,fmpaot3,t1_fmpafob,1586277505.0,I feel you on that one. I need to get back into digital art though but I find that my sketches/traditional art looks a lot better.
