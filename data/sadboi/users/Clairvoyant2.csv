1. No sexy time if you haven't showered

2. No sleeping in the same bed if you haven't showered lately

(I'm allergic to gluten) even if I know I'll probably spend a day or 2 in the bathroom in pain because of it The Pig (it's a nickname, not an insult) in my brain tells me to feed it 24/7. The nagging part in your mind is trying to justify cheating and binging on carb loaded meals. Lock that fucker up and tell him/her to shut up and throw away the key.

We all have days we wanna sit on the floor cuddling a ice cream pie and whatever go to junk food you crave. But  find alternatives, ones you know you LOVE (bacon cheese for the win!) And eat that because 1 its healthier and 2 you wont have the guilt that pizza, burgers, nachos and all that food we use to love brings us in the following hours or days. 

One last thing I promise....maybe.. 
There is a book (with a stupid name that I wish would change but whatever) that's called Never Binge again - Glenn Livingston. Check it out and itll give you a new perspective on Keto and dieting. 

Love ya! KCKO!!"

xxketo4u2,f3bjmql,t3_de71la,1570811795.0,"You can make SO many personal sized or snack sized foods! Low carb pizza bakes, chicken something's, breakfast anything's. Lots of options especially since cast iron makes anything taste better (idk why but its true) and it does well in an oven at higher temperatures"

Summer sausage and cheese to the rescue for taming my cravings for savory foods (lookin at you Taco Bell and Sonic) 

My mom and stepdad whom I live with rent free (bless their hearts) notice when I get stressed I tend to binge no matter how hard I try not to. So they started trying to remove unnecessary triggers (like my dog waking me up at 4 am because why not) (I dont sleep well and usually only have a couple hours of sleep at night so I'm always tired and stressed about everything) 

I'm working up the courage to go to our housekeeping department to pick up another shift for more money. I dont really want to do that because it would have me leaving work at 1 am but I gotta make the $$$ to support the $$$ everyone (banks) want from me."
