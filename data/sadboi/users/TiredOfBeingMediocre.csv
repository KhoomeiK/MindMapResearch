Yes, all the time. Nowadays I rarely find classical works I genuinely enjoy so when I do, I listen on repeat for days or weeks until I can’t stand it anymore. Right now I am abusing Othello Overture by Dvorak... my god what a great piece.

>And then more or less completely lose interest because it is now completely predictable.

I wouldn’t say I lose interest because it’s *predictable*. In fact I enjoy the music way more when I’m familiar with how it goes (in recordings and most definitely for live performances)! 
For me, losing interest is a matter of how I feel. When I like music, it makes me *feel* something. So generally when I no longer feel those emotions to the same extent, I stop listening. It’s kinda like taking the same dose of drugs for a while, you get used to it and have to up the dose to get the same high. The music that I “exhaust” in this way generally gets stored in a separate playlist where I don’t listen to it for a long time. Then, when it’s been a couple of months, I’ll revisit and get almost that same high as before, but not quite. And I’ll get tired of it quicker than before.

I’ve noticed this doesn’t apply to live performances. Live performances are an exception, I almost always enjoy them, but moreso when I am very familiar with a piece of music. And sometimes listening to new recordings can refresh a piece for me!"

Give me a break. Just because we’re saying something that’s true and you don’t like doesn’t mean we’re “bitter.” I’ve seen a lot of your comments on this post and it seems like everyone who you disagree with is just “bitter” and needs to go to therapy.

I’m in my last semester as an undergraduate in mechanical engineering. Everything seems like it’s falling apart because of the virus. Even before the virus, I was struggling to keep up with everything. But I at least had graduation, senior design, etc. to look forward to. Now the graduation ceremony that I’ve worked towards for five years is not going to happen. I know, it’s just a ceremony, but I remember the feeling I got when I went to my friends’ and family members’ college graduations. It made me look forward to mine so much. And now it’s cancelled. Senior design was supposed to involve building a physical prototype, but now that’s not happening either. It’s all on paper. That was supposed to be a major project experience in my undergraduate education that I was looking forward to for years. 

Nowadays, I spend all of my time indoors (obviously) at home with my dysfunctional family. I am very depressed, anxious, and unhappy with life. I have skipped all of my online “lectures” for the last two weeks. I am barely keeping up with assignments and club duties. I have almost no motivation. I don’t know what to do.

aznidentity,fnjtjt5,t1_fnjr6dw,1587006662.0,"My experience with dating apps has been abysmal. I have used them extensively in the past (Hinge, Tinder, CMB, Bumble, etc). One thing I’ve learned is that South Asian males are among the least attractive people on dating apps. That’s evident in the fact that I will get 1 or 2 matches per several hundred swipes. I’ve tried everything to make my profiles better (photos, captions, witty opening lines) but nothing works. It’s all about how you look, and ethnicity plays a huge role in that.

I respectfully disagree with your opinion that what I’ve written here is not “positive Asian representation.” Racist trolls can do whatever they want — you and I should not give a fuck about them. They are low life losers who will not make a difference in this world.

I found this community in my search for a place to share my thoughts on a somewhat obscure issue. I don’t think what I wrote is just “an essay about a breakup.” It’s (1) a different perspective on an important issue and (2) an attempt at voicing solidarity with my East Asian counterparts. I encourage you to read the discussion on this post because people have brought up a lot of good points.

Thanks for wishing me good luck, but I don’t need it. Luck won’t do jack shit for me. If there’s one thing I’ve learned about being a South Asian man in a white male dominated society, it’s that I have to take the bull by the horns to get the life I want."
