B) The only subreddits I post memes in are r/memes,  r\dankmemes and my personal subreddit. My subreddit doesn't count, since I own it and I can do whatever I want with it.

Therefore, by your logic i'm posting in two subreddits - I'll give you that. However, it's once and it's not like I do it all fucking day and spam each subreddit.

C) The video promo ''reposting'' has nothing to do with the memes.

D) Since the mods of those subreddits have not banned me nor the hundreds of other people posting their videos to promote, I'd say it's a none issue.

E) If there was an issue, they could ban me and I'd have no problem with it."

Can I buy that Marko Stunt's opponents are getting legitimately by him? That depends. If his matches were worked more like Rey's (where the larger opponent is overwhelmed by Rey's speed and the speed of the impact and the imbalance that is caused after), I could buy it.

I've seen one match where Stunt wrestled like Rey. I believe it was against the Lucha Bros - and it worked perfectly. However, every other match has been completely different, and IMO, not good."

It's not just about people saying negative things, but it's also about avoiding negative people entirely.
