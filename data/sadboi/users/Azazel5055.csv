schizoaffective,fgkif4p,t1_fgkgmoc,1580866287.0,"I honestly don't know how to answer that last question because he doesn't really tell people because he doesn't talk to people, but he has never told me I couldn't tell anyone so I kinda just did? Like my mom was one of the first people that knew. If anything it has just made people more understanding of how he is. It is easier to explain to people(close friends that is) the situation one time then it is to make excuses each time. 

It is going to be a learning curve, for both of you. And while I don't speak for him or even my husband, I fell like this...if we are struggling to learn how to cope, imagine being the one who was actually diagnosed...I am sure it's hard. So I just do my best to let him know I am here for him, and that his diagnosis isn't going to scare me away.

And one day I am sure it will get easier for you as it has for me, but honestly it takes time, and I know we still have a long ways to go. But it's all about finding what works for you and if it is worth it.  

I would talk to him about perhaps letting you at least explain to your mother the situation. Explain to him that it is exhausting to try and lie and make excuses. It may take time still but at least open that dialogue. I hate that it has a stigma, because it does make it harder, but even anxiety and depression are becoming more talked about and more people are becoming understanding of that, so maybe one day...."

So I can relate to you in many ways, besides schooling and stuff it sounds like the stages our relationship has gone through, also this is my second marriage and I am in my late 20s and we have been together for 6 years this July. It has been rough. His SZA went undiagnosed for half our relationship. I would say at times I have considered giving up, but mental illness runs in my family so sometimes I do feel like I am more understanding and more willing to let things go, or ""deal with them"" 
I honestly don't think my husband will ever be societies standard of normal. Meds help, sometimes...to an extent, therapy helps, in some form, to an extent. But sometimes I too feel like I lose my spouse for periods of time. If this is someone you love to the extent of acceptance, then you have to understand there will be change, and things you want may never be....the way you see them. Everyone has different thresholds, everyone is willing to deal with different levels. My husband has a hard time holding a job as well so we go him on disability, and it has helped in some aspect.
I too struggle with the non social circle, and him not wanting to go places, he is still working on that. In the meantime I have a pretty stellar support system of my own. I have my best friend who I call my adventure wife, she goes on family vacations with me, while he stays at home gaming, she goes out with me, and whenever I need her for support while he is going through an episode, she is there. She is my person. Maybe you can get you a person. One thing I have had to accept is that his normal is NOT my normal. We compromise on things. It takes work. And sometimes I have to remind myself when he takes small strides. It easy to take for granted that he cleaned the kitchen, but sometimes I have to reaaaaaallllly think about it, and realize that he is trying. Do I think he could try harder? Sometimes, but honestly I have decided to stop constantly focusing on what I wish our relationship would be without this diagnoses, and start focusing on what it is now, and how we can make it work. Because I will tell you one thing, I still have fun at the beach without him, all my friends and family understand my situation and never question why he is isn't there, they all love him just the same. Do I wish he was there at the beach with me? Yes. But would he enjoy himself the same way i do? Nope. 
All relationships have problems and obstacles, you just have to decide which things you are willing to deal with and when to jump ship. My jump ship is infidelity. I have made that very clear. I have been more forgiving on things then others, but that is one thing I am not willing to deal with. He is my person. My at home person..and I am ok with that."

We learned to clean together and starting off she'd get the obvious stuff as I did the fine tuning for lack of better phrases, but as we worked together she would pay attention and slowly pick up on it."
