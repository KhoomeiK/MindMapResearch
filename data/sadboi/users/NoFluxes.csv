BipolarReddit,fmohfm4,t3_fwfpwi,1586259074.0,"Of course it is. Once you're sure you have it, you know that you will have to manage it for the rest of your life. There's a lot of myths though. People assume it only gets worse, people assume that because of the stigma with mental illness that everyone who is bipolar is capable of snapping and dangerous. 

&#x200B;

Lithium has kept me sane, once I knew for sure it was it, it has been a staple in my daily routines to take it. I have tried all sorts of paths and remedies, and I have trusted many doctors to find out doing it their way has not worked out for me. But I do know I have it, and mine is not with extreme mania, but I have felt a bad episode that was drug induced before.

&#x200B;

You know your body the most. More than any doctor could ever feel. I'm not saying never to trust them, but you can tell if you're stable or not or zombified more than anyone else could. Mental illness is chronic, but just remember, having one doesn't make you it. You are not the disease. Once stability is there, you will know it is just another responsibility to stay on top of it. There may be no cure, but you can indeed find stability and then structure will be there in all aspects. Stay away from all recreational drugs if you're bipolar."
spirituality,fm6lr6k,t1_fm6h4tp,1585797016.0,"Maybe God comes to us in these ways. I was not religious before it either. I used to refer to the higher power as the law of attraction. I saw my life get a lot better over the years until the drug trauma came a long. I was in an important field (nursing) before things collapsed. People looked at me as that inspiration. But yeah I was tricked, by a dumb bowl of weed. That bowl was definitely laced with a psychedelic drug of some sort. 

In my experience I learned a lot, and I learned why we have to live out the most pure and gracious life as possible. Because surely, what we do now, will affect our afterlife. I know I still have a whole life to live out, I am not completely recovered from what happened, but it got me thinking. I did a lot of research on various religions and I understand the angels to be relevant in all of the stories. The angels came much before the humans, they had their own order, but some obviously weren't very fond of the concept of the one true God. 

Vanity is why people can't accept the concept of obedience, but it is important to understand it. I don't know if fate is real, but I feel like I am important, and that I deserve a shot at being that inspiration once again."

But we have these experiences for a reason, and I know mine only came from the drugs. I am not advocating drug use in any way. For what happened to me was an accident, or trickery I should say. But I have felt the presence of the angels, both the good and the fallen ones.

It is funny you consider that there could be 9, I feel like it lines up with something. I've really tried to look into it before, and everyone will tell you something different."
spirituality,fm6e3cn,t1_fm4dv60,1585792032.0,"I believe the angels spoke to me. And although my experience was drug induced, they showed me there was more to life than the flesh. Death is not the end. 

I saw a glimpse of my afterlife, and they promised me the heavens. As far as the dimensions go, it is hard to say. For a little bit, I was convinced there were 9 for some reason, and 9 to match the original amount of planets in our solar system. Perhaps we don't have hard evidence of there being beyond the 4th dimension. Everything after that becomes spiritual. And perhaps only these spirits can freely roam the other dimensions because they are not of the flesh."

bipolar,flewglg,t1_flekpa6,1585092914.0,"lol right, the western way, let's just keep popping pills to mask all our problems...

I'm just speaking from experience, docs want you all numbed out and zombified to control you, because in reality, they do believe they are above you, it is an arrogance issue. Perhaps some aren't bad, but then of course, they would suggest non pharmaceutical methods first. But hey I understand, because if you're in a crisis or severe manic episode, that's when you may need them over everything else."
POTS,fledgtv,t3_fnyh3c,1585082272.0,"I had dizzy spells, I felt like I would faint all the time, even just from sitting upright. Most of the time it didn't happen, but it still felt crippling to the point I couldn't walk or stand for long without leading to the frightening symptoms. I had bad blood pooling in my limbs, and I would have tachycardia upon being upright. No one really understood it when I was a teen, because on the outside, they couldn't really understand it. 

&#x200B;

Some people even assumed I was faking it as a teen. But eventually a neurologist and a cardiologist together led me to getting a tilt table test and it proved to be a form of dysautonomia. I later learned it was POTS. Only during the tilt table test it would lead to me fainting, because they know how to induce it and there's a certain angle of being upright that would prove it."
bipolar,flecgv2,t3_fo6m4k,1585081717.0,"How could meds be the cure when they come with nasty side effects? Consider that for a moment. I was losing my senses because of lithium carbonate, and they claimed it was a therapeutic dose. Every single antipsychotic I was put on made me lethargic and lifeless. Every ssri I was put on made me manic. Sounds like all of it is just garbage. Doctors will convince you that you need meds for life, but that is a bad outlook. 

I have found ways to manage being bipolar with natural methods and a safe form of lithium. But I know it is a lifelong battle, just remember, you are not the disorder, you have it. Meds aren't a holy grail, doctors do make mistakes too."
BipolarReddit,fl95jx0,t1_fl936ba,1584941754.0,"That is the flaw, you need focus also, and lithium will balance you out. Do not trust carbonate though. Orotate is def safer."

dysautonomia,fkzrp2u,t3_flho1r,1584678414.0,"I've had POTS since I was 15. Surely it does get better if you condition your body to work harder. It wasn't until closer to my mid twenties that the symptoms greatly improved when I started doing powerlifting and general resistance training in the gym. RIght now is a hard time for all of us, but it is indeed crucial to stay active. I suggest doing anything you can with dumbbells at home, or basic calisthenics. Cardio does get the blood pumping, but it also will keep you leaner than you'd like to be sometimes."
CoronavirusIllinois,fkj8xcb,t1_fkivlc2,1584239293.0,"You mean a positive mindset? People attack my mindset, yet I am the one being optimistic about it. Being a shut in and looking at the news all day only makes you more paranoid. I understand the concern, truly. But I do know that this scare should teach people a lesson. Good hygiene is not preached about enough, until all of a sudden we see an epidemic like this and people are suddenly losing it.

You want me to sit at home all day and protect the old people from getting it. That is reasonable if it were that simple, but we all live normal lives, and those that don't, are the ones who don't understand it. Perhaps Italy has it worse, China has it worse, but we can learn from their mistakes, and the numbers that we're supposedly looking at are definitely lower for a reason."
dysautonomia,fkj8hjl,t3_fibhfh,1584238962.0,"I had POTS very bad from 15-23 years old. The one thing that really helped solely over the years was probably the gym. Getting into college helped build social skills though, eventually I got my GED and went into a nursing program, but life is hard, as a person who dealt with POTS, I assure you it can get better as you age, but you have to condition the body.

&#x200B;

Focus on exercise and diet, day by day you will see results as long as you push yourself to do more. Just know I once felt bedridden, and eventually I did go on to live a normal life, but yes, enjoy your youth still. I am 26 now, and life is hitting me very hard."

Perhaps I am overlooking some things, or perhaps it will blow over soon and events won't be being cancelled anymore and grocery store shelves will go back to normal."
CoronavirusIllinois,fki2nut,t1_fkhp46l,1584210738.0,"Idk, I signed up for personal training sessions before the heads up it was spreading in IL faster. I'm still hitting the gym a couple times a week, just be smart about it, wash your hands and wipe down the equipment.

bipolar,fkga5t2,t1_fkg9s4m,1584153898.0,"I do think I should see a doctor if it doesn't go away, however, some days it did greatly improve, and other days it would come back. I am hopeful, that if it really was just the lithium, the side effects linger, and if it really caused eye pressure, that can take a long time to subside apparently if it's related to optic nerve issues. 

&#x200B;

I am still able to read, but it is a little irritating. However, one week off the lithium may not be quick enough to assume anything. I definitely know it started when I got on a higher dose though. Specifically the extended release version (lithobid). If it really is optic nerve issues, even a doctor couldn't fix it on the spot though, but perhaps give a clear diagnosis."

I question why doctors easily prescribe trazodone for sleep though, there's a lot of issues with this."
bipolar,fkg3dt9,t1_fkfwxnq,1584148959.0,"The only other medication I took for a while during this was trazodone. I refused antipsychotics on various occasions due to the fact I felt very lethargic on all of them. 

Throughout the first few weeks of taking the lithium I didn't really notice many eye issues other than sometimes I would get watery eyes and they would be irritated randomly . Lithium can be toxic, even at therapeutic doses, the body still doesn't take it well, but most people agree side effects at these dosages are reversible."

In these 9 dimensions and through opening of the gates this is where the confusion comes from. I could not see the demons in the flesh, but I could see them through people's eyes and feel their energy. Satan would often use my animals to hide himself.

I still have my innocence. Well, I had to repent some sins during the battle. But because the demons knew I had my virginity still, when I was reborn I felt all of them taking advantage of me. I know that's a lot of details, but the sensations felt too real, I then knew that I was a different spiritual being than just a human.
