socialskills,fn0ynuz,t1_fn0abvq,1586551322.0,"I thought that NT people might be able to point out things they find weird or annoying with autistic people so I could look it up and make sure I don’t come across as that, hence why I asked. But Thank you for the advice."
socialskills,fn0yf2j,t1_fn0fimo,1586551186.0,"I’m sorry to hear you’re being bullied. But hey, keep being you, okay? Bubbly people are great. And perhaps they were jelous. Always, when the question came up why they were being mean, either by me or by adults, they always Said something along the lines of ”Idk, I just think she’s weird” or ”Idk, she’s just annoying” without ever being able to explain why I was weird or annoying. I just was."
socialskills,fn0y1i9,t1_fn0c2iv,1586550975.0,"Thank you. I do know that I’m not always self-aware, so I always question what I did wrong when someone dislikes me or is mean. That’s what I was thaught."
socialskills,fn0xw67,t1_fn0l2sk,1586550892.0,"Yeah... ...Not everyone reacts badly when they meet me, but it just puzzles me that I don’t have to do anything but appear to make some people go automatically mean."
socialskills,fn031tb,t1_fn02mqr,1586534546.0,"Yeah... ...That could explain some if it. But most times I hadn’t even spoken or done anything, people just hated me as soon as I stepped into the room."

TigerKing,fmic6s3,t1_fmi1t6y,1586106661.0,"Then I can understand why people make memes defending him. Just wanted to know if it was ironic, since I’m autistic and can’t always tell if it’s just for the memes or seriously."

depression,febbtvd,t3_enrs4c,1578957261.0,"That’s an even worse sign of depression; feeling it but not being able to tell anyone. You should keep trying to reach out, even if you’re struggling to find the right words. This is not something you should have to deal with alone... ...take care"
dating_advice,febarwm,t3_eo5spx,1578957006.0,"Maybe you should try being alone for a while. I tried both dating again and again and not dating for two years, and I can honestly say that I needed to be alone more than just someone to dull the pain. And about the depression, it’s not your fault. Some people become strangers because of the illness and it’s okay to miss them."
