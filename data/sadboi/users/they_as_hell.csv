BPD,fjxkag1,t1_fjwstwl,1583676129.0,"Same. I'm 31 - had 4 serious relationships in my 20s... 

In one right now for 5 months, and the bpd is SLAPPING.

I don't want to continue the cycle. I just want it to last. She's the sweetest, most understanding woman I've ever dated, so naturally the self sabotage has really started to spice things up 👌🏼 🙃"
BPD,fjxjw4r,t3_ff9h3u,1583675770.0,"I'm 31, trans guy - I am just being introduced to DBT through my therapist. I've only had 4 sessions with them so far, but it's been incredibly eye opening. 

Mental health/therapy is entirely new to me, so it's pretty shocking to read strangers describe my most secret thoughts and feelings. Grateful for the internet/all of you for contributing and helping all of us feel less alone."

BPD,fhswih4,t1_fhn3k8k,1581866440.0,This is why I have no friends. I can't keep up with them. I just slowly disappear/fade away. I only have 2 friends I can stand to be around/make an effort for. 🤷‍♂️ It is what it is.
