I'd say, send a message to her and as her if you've done anything wrong and explain how you feel because it's hard for someone with bpd to get their emotions across or even talk about them.

If she tells you directly and not in an argument, to just let things be or leave her alone, do so.

If she doesn't tell you to give her space or leave her alone, continue to talk to her as a mate.

I normally throw silent tantrums when I've perceived someone's actions as negative (against me) even if it isn't directly towards me. This is all part of splitting and I think she wants to know you still like or care about her.

My top skills for coping is:

1. Whatever your racing/impulsive/destructive thoughts tell you, DON'T DO IT. It will take a while to figure out bpd thoughts opposed to natural thoughts but in time, you'll begin to master it.

2. Everyone has blips. It's okay to relapse and it's okay to take a mental health day. Practice self care and use the negative energy to fuel positive things e.g. Work, education and healthy living.

3. STAY AWAY FROM DRUGS. particularly Mdma or E because it can either give you euphoria and feelings that make you feel like you don't have bpd or a horrible trip that will be worsened by bpd leading to an increased risk of harm. It can also lead you to believe you're going crazy.

4. If you feel that rage/bubbling feeling, ask to go to the toilet or for a ciggie to take 5 mins out and reduce feelings so you don't act impulsively

5. Bpd IS NOT A CURSE OR LIFE SENTENCE. you can live a good life providing you manage your symptoms.

6. TAKE YOUR MEDS. You are prescribed them for a reason. This can help with a variety of symptoms.

7. YOU ARE NOT ALONE. bpd may feel isolating but know there's always a community out there that are here to support you."

This can lead you into difficult situations and being open to being manipulated. You will do anything to please them, even if it risks your self. Until you stop splitting, you don't see how much damage you've caused. You can put the person you're splitting on above everyone else that is genuinely important to you.

This makes splitting negative (viewing someone as bad) a lot worse. You hate them and sometimes end up blaming them for your poor choices (tbf if they know about your bpd then they're actually being toxic to you by taking advantage of positive splitting) neg splitting can also cause you to distance yourself from people they associate with which feeds into other bpd symptoms. Neg splitting commonly causes downwards spirals with regards to mental health, especially if they were once your FP. It's usually when I'm neg splitting that I realise I've been splitting. 

Splitting can cause those with bpd to refrain from building and maintaining relationships due to fear they'll get fucked over as they are extremely vulnerable in the posi split and can be dangerous in the neg split (dark thoughts towards the person they were splitting on).

If you recognise splitting, tell the person with bpd so that they are more aware and try to keep them at a reasonable distance from the other person till the splitting is reduced.
It is difficult to let go of someone you have split on but it's for the best (most of the time) to remove them from your life because the relationship will be toxic and will keep on splitting after the first initial split. This can't be applied to all splitting cases though, it depends on the person and the connection to the person with bpd and if they have fantasised about a life similar to theirs prior to having a relationship."

When I first believed I had bpd and then after I knew I was diagnosed, I never thought I had a valid trauma and only experienced what I perceived as valid trauma a year after.
In my opinion, bpd manifests during the primary personality developing stage of 3-8 (I believe, don't quote me) and anything experienced in that period could cause it. Eg my mum always was late to pick me up so I always wondered if she was coming and felt bad for the staff there.
Also parents with personality traits similar to bpd but not as intense can also help to cause the disorder due to the fact that we tend to be most similar to our parents due to time spent with them and idolising them. Also being exposed to the way they behave and children seeing that as correct because it's what they're commonly exposed to.
Im pretty certain that cptsd and bpd are often misdiagnosed as one and other too. They can also be comorbid."

There's a higher risk factor with psychotic disorders and based upon the information on this post, I'd say its safe to rule it out.
Jumping from therapist to therapist will prevent the practitioner getting a long term history of your personality traits and symptoms. If you stick with a therapist, it can help them to conclude on to a diagnosis. Tbf you only really need to look out for mania which in all honesty, you wouldn't realise is happening unless you've had multiple manic episodes. This is because you can be a huge risk to yourself and those around you. The more you read into your behaviour and possible symptoms, the more they are exacerbated in your head.

BPD,fed79rn,t1_fed2amr,1579002202.0,"Ayy my guyyy
I began to use them because I loved watching the visuals, it made me calm and at peace.
Im now planning on using them for therapeutic purposes with cev to explode my inner self and spirituality.
I've had 2 bad experiences but because of them I can handle my trips better.
I've never micro dosed because I've only taken lsd gummies but I'm planning on taking shrooms.
I don't know if I would micro dose because I haven't researched the benefits and what it's like but Id prefer to break through on psychedelics once I find a stable and reliable source☮️✌️
Edit: Dbt skills are amazing for coping with trips and ensuring you stay on the right path, happy tripping!! Pm me any time about it or when you're tripping☮️"
BPD,fed6y93,t3_eojoom,1579001806.0,"Like you're an alien.
You grow up wondering why everyone secretly hates you and why you can't laugh and have banter in the same way everyone else does (not to say we can't have a laugh). You wonder why you think different about a person based on when you're near them or away from them or their actions.
You wonder why nobody cares and why you get so fixated on people. You wonder why you crave to die all the time.
You wish you were bipolar so you'd at least get a couple days of feeling good for once (me personally, idk about anyone else-also not glamorizing here).
You wonder why you can't maintain friendships and why you always fuck up relationships.
You wonder why you're so different.
You believe you're cursed."
BPD,fed6rl6,t3_eojv7t,1579001571.0,All the time. That's what developed my fascination with psychedelics.
BPD,fed6q3d,t3_eojxl6,1579001517.0,I level with this🙌🙌 I found that song and baby blue a few years ago and the calmness of the song is quite comforting. It's one of the songs you can play whilst sad but doesn't trigger you
BPD,fed6n3f,t3_eojxxw,1579001412.0,"I 100% level with you on this. Its both a brilliant thing and a horrible thing dependant on the situation. Sometimes I'm worried ill hurt someone else. I've expressed this to my most recent therapist but I was just shrugged off🤷‍♀️
I treat it as a secret power and when it's activated, I'm in 007 bitch mode😂"
BPD,fecal2z,t1_feca9va,1578969644.0,Welcome to the cult of the cursed ones😂😂😩💀
BPD,fecai0k,t1_fecaapt,1578969596.0,Omfg ennit. I feel like everyone picks anyone but my side in things. Like literally ever.
BPD,feca7x1,t1_feca3u2,1578969445.0,"Another brain storm: abandonment issues

We could feel like that indicates that they're going to leave us and our brains react to it via mood"
BPD,feca3u2,t1_fec9ux9,1578969380.0,"It might also be a neglect or abuse thing. Most people with bpd allegedly have faced neglect or abuse in childhood.

Or maybe that if we see someones emotion change, we feel like we've hurt them some how but we don't know or do know and the emotions such as guilt and shame explode inside us."
BPD,fec9ux9,t1_fec7mtb,1578969242.0,"I think it's down to thought patterns n stuff.
Uno back in the ollld days children didn't look adults in the eye because they were lesser or something on the lines of that? I feel like it comes from that.
Like for me, I feel deeply uncomfortable and like I'm staring at them for too long or their eyes are piercing into my soul and it low key hurts a bit but not full on pain.
Maybe it's because if we look someone in the face, we can see their emotion more and we fear what their face is conveying to us.
It might also be we feel like we've done something wrong even though we haven't and looking in the eye is admitting to it."
BPD,fec9git,t1_fec7w6u,1578969024.0,"To ""normal"" people it 100% is something an attention seeker or over analyser would say but they don't and will never understand that a change like that can physically hurt and impact us the same way it would a baby😬😬

To clarify too cus I feel like I'm coming across mean, I don't mean to say we're attention seeking or whatever bcs trust me I get the feels bro"
