BabyBumps,fdu1hvp,t1_fbrhcku,1578725842.0,"I used mj my second pregnancy due to HG and multiple mental illnesses, as well as nursing two kids for a year+. I understand others not wanting to take that risk, and that's fine. Like anything else, I weigh the benefits vs risks. Benefits > potential risks for me personally, much like other medications I take. I would make the same decision again."

prolife,f2u8eh8,t1_f2sq3gm,1570410015.0,"I definitely worried, non stop actually... but I had to weigh the benefits vs risks for my own health and my baby's. It was because of my worries I held off on Zofran for about a month at the beggining of that pregnancy, and I still regret waiting. I would take it immediately if I had another HG pregnancy, no doubt. Luckily, my daughter is extremely healthy and adjusted!"

prolife,f2skpc4,t1_f2sgods,1570384174.0,"Hello, hyperemesis gravidarum is extremely difficult. I had this with my second child. I think women suffering with this need more support! I think some doctors don't take women seriously and write it off as just morning sickness. It made me understand *why* a woman would get an abortion in this situation, but did not make me support it. Likely an unpopular opinion, but I used marijuana to ease nausea and vomiting. That, with my other medication, got me down to only vomiting 1 to 3 times a day later in pregnancy. I think women are not readily offered enough options to cope. Doctors denying anti nausea meds like Zofran because they are not taken seriously. Even just a little more support, just listening to these women, I think would reduce the women who are leaning towards abortion in these instances. I won't sugarcoat, it was a horrible pregnancy both mentally and physically... but my daughter kicked around in there and I knew she was worth it. She will be a year this coming weekend."

TwoXChromosomes,epqelwl,t1_epqe265,1559404530.0,Okay. Earlier you stated that the CDCs abortion stats would probably make people feel better if they understood them. Why do you think that?
TwoXChromosomes,epqdoil,t1_epqcw1s,1559404057.0,"That's just the fact of embryology though. That's why I'm stuck on that. If you could find me an embryology or biology citation specifying the offspring is *not* a separate entity, but just an extension of female anatomy, I am all ears, truly! The stats I have seen (and I may be wrong, this is from my memory) is that 88 percent happen within the first 12 weeks, or the first trimester. I'm having trouble understanding how most can occur before 6 weeks when that'd just around the time women are finding out they're pregnant. Do you have a source for the claim that the majority of abortions are before 6 weeks?"
TwoXChromosomes,epqby3f,t1_epq9via,1559403216.0,"Thing is, the fetus *is* a separate entity. A ZEF is a unique and individual human, not an extension to another human (the woman). I support the things listed in order to reduce abortion. I don't see why other pro lifers dont.

Edited from typo*"
TwoXChromosomes,epq8run,t1_epq7vuy,1559401635.0,"Thanks for responding civilly. Science did, I agree, which is why I base my stance on that. It wasn't I that decided a fetus is a human being, biology and embryology are clear when a new life cycle and new human organism exists. I have a consistent life ethic, too. Womb to tomb. I think personhood is something all humans should have no matter their development, dependency, or location. Hope this makes sense, running on little sleep."

TwoXChromosomes,epp7469,t1_epp689p,1559366688.0,Haha great rebuttal. You too though bud.
TwoXChromosomes,epp6100,t1_epp5kyr,1559365372.0,"Weird because that's literally the issue with many pro choicers; not thinking for themselves, and based on the same regurgitated arguments and assumptions you've already said, wonder if that's actually projection. Nobody wants to sacrafice the quality and health of anyone, we just don't agree with killing humans at any stage of development, but I'm so glad you just automatically know my position for me. Theres really not an overpopulation problem, and I'm not sure how abortion is going to fix starvation, but ok. Sounds like actually focusing on the issues that pro choicers defend abortion for could actually be more of a solution than killing members of our species. What do I know though? Apparently I can't think for myself and you know more than me. Why engage back if you're going straight to that?"
TwoXChromosomes,epp57f2,t1_epp4ogy,1559364420.0,Nah. It's a human rights issue.
TwoXChromosomes,epp4cnn,t1_eposejq,1559363457.0,Disagree with your first statement. I'm not religious and my views on abortion were never religious. I'm an atheist and pro life. Check out Secular Pro life.
