RedDeadOnline,felou0a,t3_epr9f9,1579227319.0,"If you do nachodoches saddle with the hooded stirrups then you get +3. It makes almost all the horses that I've tried feel very equal. 

I have had every breed of horse in the game, multiple colors of each. I obviously have a horse problem. 

But when it comes down to it, I ride my tiger striped mustang (14 gold) and  appaloosas (18 gold) the most.

I have tried and just hate the Arabian. It is far over hyped for what it is. When the game first came out the hype was much more accurate. But many more horses have been added since and ""elite handling"" doesnt really seem to mean shit. I still have it in my stable (white arabian), but I have also had it for over a month and it is just now getting to level 3 bonding. That is how little I ride it, if that gives any indication of my feelings towards them. 

For gun fights, my Bretons (dun and steel) and Kladruber (silver) will stand there and take it. 

For running all over different terrains and doing little cliff jumps and mountain climbs, I definitely choose my mustang or an appaloosa. 

Taller horses are better at not slowing down when running through water, I do this quite often, as I never follow trails. My kladruber is the best at that. Super tall, pretty fast (especially with the saddle/stirrups), and takes gunfire fantastically. 

My Missouri Fox Trotter is my fastest horse and handles really well. I do feel this is one of the most solid all around horses, it does buck for cougars and after a bit with wolves. The only downside is that they only come in two colors. If I were to choose a second horse, it would be the MFT, it will end up being your first horse. 


That said, think about your play style and find something that fits with what you do. Or be like me and have ten horses and constantly rotate them out. It is quite fun."
