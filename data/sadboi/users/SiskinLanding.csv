The answer varies massively from person to person. Some people have one episode of psychosis and never have another, others live with it every single day. How it impacts is also very personal. I know people with long-term psychotic conditions who have families, jobs etc. Yes, they do have limitations as well, but what they are and how serious they are varies significantly. 

Regardless of psychosis you are you. An episode doesn't change that. When health issues impact yes, dreams *may* have to be modified or delayed (*may*) but that doesn't mean you should automatically give up on them. Give yourself a break, see how this plays out and take it a step at a time. I'm guessing you're quite young if this is your first episode so you have a long way to go. For now look after yourself. Your dreams will still be there tomorrow."
explainlikeimfive,f9pkbql,t3_e6el5h,1575540253.0,"Very big question. 

u/blackjackgabbiani is right to say some women are just cruel but it would be too simple to say that's the only or even main reason. 

u/Lipinator is probably giving a bigger picture answer. 

I would say the short answer is that they believe it's the right thing to do. 

When a culture insists so heavily on certain behaviours many (or debatably most) people will internalise that. A woman who's been trained from birth that certain behaviours are unacceptable and should lead to death may well believe that to be true. They might not like it, but they may well accept it.

The deeper issue of whether it's a form of grooming or not is a bit harder to answer. Grooming is when people subjected to abuse internalise and take responsibility for what is being done to them (in the UK it is now considered a form of abuse in its own right as it's so damaging to mental health and wellbeing).   
If a mother has been made to believe that certain 'faults' are entirely their responsibility they are likely to believe the same if they see the 'faults' in their daughters. This can lead to a mother actively blaming their daughter as opposed to supporting them. Personally I would argue that this is definitely part of what you're seeing.

It is important to remember that many people in cultures that have honour killings don't agree with them. There are plenty of people who reject and fight against this kind of behaviour, many mothers who would protect their daughters etc. Individuals respond to these kinds of things differently for a huge range of different reasons."

I'm white so I can only give you an academic rather than a lived experience answer. 

Language is a living, breathing entity so meanings of words shift over time. I would suggest that what you're seeing here is the current shift. It's often small but the difference is important when you're talking about identity. That refining of self-expression can make a huge difference both to how someone can talk about themselves and others, and also how they can perceive themselves. Think of the way terms like gay and queer have shifted rapidly over the last hundred years or so. The terms change fast because the issues are currently moving fast."

Different types of learning (visual, physical, linguistic) are processed differently so at a guess it's to do with you having strong pathways for that particular kind of learning and/or restricted facial recognition pathways. 

I would suggest using what you're good at to help you with what you're struggling with - attach the person  you're talking with to a line of text (from a script or made up). So a chat with a director called Cameron could become 'I put the camera on his face, with those watery blue eyes and lazy half smile, and knew it would work'. Or, even more obvious, a Toby could be 'To be or not to be' etc.
You won't be able to do it with everyone but if you're having a proper natter with someone there should be plenty of time to some version of it.

38. While boys are overrepresented in detention, girls often suffer gender-based discrimination. Research conducted for the study shows that girls are more likely to be arrested for status offences, for behaviour rather than actual criminal activity, 
including sexual activity, truancy and running away from home. Girls living on the streets are particularly vulnerable, as they are often arrested for prostitution. If States criminalize abortion, girls risk incarceration, even where the pregnancy is a result of rape. Girls from poor families run a higher risk of institutionalization and incarceration, as they lack access to supportive systems. In detention, girls are 
particularly vulnerable to sexual and other forms of violence.

* I said *reduce* not erase bias. In a democratic country (unlike China for example) public media has influence from multiple voices, thus *reducing* bias. You can never erase bias, it's not possible, but you can limit it. 
* The performer's union Equity is who sites the BBC as the biggest employer of actors. I've been involved with the union for years and support for the BBC & license fee is considered crucial for the industry. 
* The BBC contracts smaller production companies and freelance individuals for many projects, yes, but it's still the BBC who are the overall producer and distributor. Without them a lot of the smaller teams and individuals would struggle much more. 
* You seem to be unhappy with revenue coming from abroad and IDK why. If your license fee is being used to create media that brings in far more than is invested in it surely that's a good thing? If it's China or America, Netflix or Amazon who are subsequently buying the product it's still bringing money into the UK, plenty of which gets reinvested into new productions. 
* Similarly with other merchandise. The products you pay for are the free radio, TV shows and films that you receive. It makes good sense for our license fees to be invested in other products that can keep generating income. That allows the BBC and other subsidised companies to do more. 
* Yes, educational resources. You clearly don't work with children. 
* TV Licensing produce a breakdown of where their money goes: [https://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/topics/what-does-your-licence-fee-pay-for-top13](https://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/topics/what-does-your-licence-fee-pay-for-top13) It quite clearly tells you that it goes to more than just the BBC and tells you how many people actually use the BBC, again, whether they realise it or not. 
* I've sat and talked with BBC producers. They are definitely held accountable. 
* CNN and ABC are private companies with entirely corporate and/or political agendas. As already stated, the BBC is not unbiased but it is significantly less bias than those two.
* The difference between bailing out a bank and funding public media is that public media makes profit for the country, doesn't collapse every decade or so, doesn't lead to austerity, and doesn't leave individual billionaires while other starve. Not really comparable. 
* The BBC is not a private enterprise. There are private branches of it to allow for certain types of work, much as most big charities have a Ltd company under the same brand to do different work. 
* I haven't looked at TV output re: proportion of reality TV to drama, documentary etc. for a while but last time I did it was Channel 4 and Channel 5 who were most reliant on reality TV. 
* TV has *always* used repeats, often because viewers want the chance to see things again. This is a reasonable way of making the BBC back catalogue freely available, which it should be. 
* Every company uses demographics because they're useful. That shouldn't be used to dismiss any organisation. As for data-mining... Again, I see no evidence that this is something used more by the BBC than anyone else (including Government itself). I haven't checked for a while but there used to be heavy use of focus groups, test audiences and response to public feedback from the BBC. If they're funding application renewals (which they DO have to do just like every other publicly funded organisation) is comparable to the ones I have investigated the BBC will have to **prove** that they are relevant to significant numbers of people before they get the funding they want."

mentalhealth,f7ll9ub,t3_dwuip6,1573842922.0,"The crisis team are a short-term intervention team who come out to you every few days for a couple of weeks to get you through a crisis. This is designed to stop people seriously hurting themselves or others without having to go into hospital.

Crisis teams are very stretched so service quality varies a lot. Personally I found them helpful when I was referred to them."

autism,f7fshw6,t3_dvzcdk,1573685741.0,"Many people (if not everyone) has violent thoughts, most of us are just trained to keep them to ourselves. People with autism don't engage in social norms like neuro-typical individuals so he may well just be saying what he's thinking because he doesn't have a filter rather than having any intention of performing an act of violence. If he was showing signs of acting on these thoughts or if it was distressing other students something might need to be done, but if he's just saying them to teachers or without impacting other students I wouldn't worry. As u/ettina says, this could be to do with additional needs that need to be looked at to help him manage the melt downs that lead him to say those things. 

The people who end up shooting up schools etc. aren't just saying these things at moments of meltdown, they become focused on them and driven by them. It's a different thing. I'm also not aware of any links between autism and that kind of violence.

I don't think the day and age make much difference to whether or not someone is capable of violence. It might change the weapons they can use but not how that person is built."

explainlikeimfive,f7b0ven,t1_f7b0ks3,1573549510.0,This would be my answer too. It's such a huge financial centre no country could risk forcing Switzerland to take a side. Everyone needs them.
britishproblems,f7b0rbd,t3_dv6ygj,1573549330.0,"I'm massively defend the TV license because:

* having publicly own broadcasters helps reduce bias (yes, I know the BBC isn't *unbiased* but it's a hell of a lot better than corporate production companies)
* the BBC is the biggest employer of actors in the UK. Without it a lot of your favourite actors simply wouldn't be where they are today.
* similarly, a lot of technical crew and other creatives (writers, directors etc.) build and sustain their careers because of opportunities at the BBC. Keeping in mind how much revenue media brings into this country these are not small issues. 
* whilst a lot of us don't regularly sit and watch the BBC or iPlayer you or members of your family almost certainly watch or listen to programmes made by the BBC elsewhere, and/or use educational resources they at least contributed to. 
* as u/catonbuckfast says, the BBC isn't the only channel that benefits from the license fee. 
* the BBC is a big international presence that keeps our country prominent around the world. 

At this point it might be better to change the format of the license fee and call it a broadcast tax but I'm not sure people would feel any better about that. It also runs the risk of not being ring-fenced if you do that, which would damage all the things above. 

BBC isn't perfect but it is a much bigger and more positive resource in this country than people realise."

explainlikeimfive,f7b02jk,t3_dv75qo,1573548283.0,"I think this is a psychology rather than biology question. 

The answer will vary from person to person but broadly it's likely to be that when you're on your sofa you're in your relaxation frame of mind so you can go to sleep but when you start your bed routine you start thinking about plans for the next day so you a/ get your brain working and b/ start worrying about how much sleep you need so can't relax. 

It's basically a 'sleep hygiene' issue, meaning your bed routine isn't helpful."

AskUK,f6vw5qh,t3_dtcoli,1573203919.0,People try to politicise it but the Royal British Legion (who the movement is organised by) passionately disagree with that. I see the poppy as a show of support for military personnel & their loved ones living with specific consequences of wartime service & wear it with no political affiliation. I think a lot of people do the same.
Theatre,f6qq97v,t3_dsoe3e,1573083192.0,"Firstly well done! That's brilliant. I hope the run is everything you want it to be. 

Nerves are often part of the process, particularly in the early stages of doing this kind of work. Honestly? A lot of the tips are fairly standard but here are a few in case:

* Do some slow, deep breathing. Mindful meditation is a good idea if you're familiar with it as it gets you out of your head. 
* Light food before bed, not too late. 
* Warm bath about an hour before bed (I believe this has now been proven in research).
* Don't look at anything to do with the show for a good few hours before you try to sleep. 
* Do something completely unrelated - watch a TV show, film, listen to an audiobook etc. (though try to avoid blue screen in bed of course)

The night before an opening the director has basically done their job. You now hand it over to the actors for them to take ownership of it."

mentalhealth,f6p97x4,t3_dsh09o,1573050864.0,"It doesnâ€™t sound great tbh. Private practitioners donâ€™t always have a great deal of choice in terms of where they can afford to practice - high rent means higher cost to patients. This still sounds like a crap choice of venue, particularly if it wasnâ€™t acknowledged or if no attempt has been made to make it more welcoming.

The staring sounds like and attempt at therapeutic use of silence. This is when a practitioner leaves space for emotions to be expressed and/or sat with, thoughts to be processed, or simply to let someone gather their thoughts. They can feel a bit weird but it shouldnâ€™t hit awkward repeatedly.

This doesnâ€™t sound sketchy in the sense of criminal but it doesnâ€™t sound very good. Iâ€™d be inclined to find someone else."
acting,f6p8knn,t1_f6p1ak8,1573050382.0,"Poeticâ€™s the word that came to my mind too. A good political speech (think I Have A Dream) could be considered to use elevated language too.

When I approach texts like this with students I yak to them about raising the stakes. Writers tend to use this kind of tool when what theyâ€™re trying to say is of greater than normal importance. That tends to help actors find the intensity and commitment it requires."
britishproblems,f6otn4n,t3_dse4nh,1573034337.0,"Because too many people canâ€™t understand the difference between freedom of speech and systemic prejudice. 

Letting people simply say whatever they want without accountability is not freedom of speech. Freedom of speech means you wonâ€™t be arrested, beaten or shot for saying things those in power donâ€™t like. 

But speaking is an action, and actions have to have consequences or all too often they rapidly descend into abuse. We teach this to children but it seems that if you have enough money you can bypass it.

The answer is to boycott those people entirely. If the only language they understand is profit thatâ€™s where you hit them."
