trashy,etl0rgp,t3_cc4pd0,1562916017.0,"I worked at a quiznos right next to a truck stop, a bus stopped at the gas station and because of the line a woman came over to the shop to try to use ours, which is for customers only. She had a toddler with her and explained he needed to go. I would have just given her the key but my boss was really set on not giving it to her if she didn't buy something. So the woman *forced* her now scared (the mom was pissed and raising her voice) child to per right on the lobby floor. More than anything I was so mad that she just stripped her son and forced him to pee in front of about ten people. The poor kid was crying so hard. That woman was vile."
