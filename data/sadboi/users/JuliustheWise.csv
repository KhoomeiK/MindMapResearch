There have been times when I’ve wished I was born a different gender not due to dysphoria but I felt due to my circumstances life might have been easier for me with the issues I was facing. I’m also a curious person so if I could magically change sex for a week I would do it just to know what it was like

I wonder how much though is people who are really unhappy with there bodies, or who do to societal expectations or sexual orientation feel that life would be better if they had been a different gender.

 Children often goes through phases when developing and can say they are different gender but this is common and I’m worried that people are convincing children who just might not fit the expected norms for there gender that they are a different gender.

I think one has to be an adult and seriously struggling with dysphoria before looking into options.

Unfortunately there’s no current way to actually change somebody’s biological sex, and once a procedure is done it can’t be undone it should not be taken lightly.

Sometimes I guess I would say I feel more “masculine” or “feminine” but I don’t equate that with my gender identity, rather personally I feel “secure” in being male, that acknowledging feminine traits is healthy, and I think a lot of men/women can feel insecure in themselves. 

I don’t have gender dysphoria, i have abuse related issues but not this so I don’t want to make statements about it as I have no experience with it, I just do want to make sure that people are careful before making life changing decisions, I feel for anybody struggling with these issues it must be extra confusing."

A major problem with psychiatry and one of the reasons drugs are handed out so much, is because at least in my countries health service doctors are billed on the quantity of patients they see, and people are lazy, it’s easy and makes the doctor look more productive to the system to quickly see a patient and hand something out, and then book a follow up, besides the overuse of drugs this practice leads to under, over and wrong diagnosis as doctors don’t have the time to properly assess there patients.

Antipsychotics are horrible drugs, I’d never take them and if I become a doctor not prescribe them (the only exception I can think of being if somebody is having a horrible trip on some psych or RC and nothing else is working, a single dose for a one time situation even then Benzos would probably work before having to do that) 

I forget who said it but if it wasn’t who they were prescribed too they would never be approved.

To be clear I’m referring to the dopamine antagonists that are referred to as antipsychotics , any drug that can calm psychosis is antipsychotic and some of these are promising like CBD oil, opioids have antipsychotic properties and honestly they are safer imo than antipsychotics

Antipsychiatry,euh297i,t3_cgbeag,1563819499.0,"Not all psychiatrists are evil, some are evil people who take advantage of vulnerable people, a large amount are not evil but do the same damage, “mental illness” often involves non-conformity, and the profession of psychiatry involves a lot of conformity, not only can that create a personality conflict but it means the types of people in the field of psychiatry are not likely to question the information that they are taught (also since it takes so long to be a doctor and the field of biology advances daily by the time any doctor begins practicing a lot of what they learned is outdated)

They don’t question the DSM, the motives of the industry and structure and societal factors alone, three of some main reasons I think Doctors are so persuaded by drug companies (besides $) 1. IME experience most all doctors are horribly and woefully uneducated in bio/organic/chemistry pharmacology, usually they only took some
Courses in their undergrad/MCAT at from what I’ve heard and read on forums most hate the subject considering it there bane, it’s hard but I actually enjoy this field of study, so most doctors can’t actually understand the biological functions of drugs on the body, the chemical structure and name, drug companies know this and use this too scam, like that drug on tv Lunesta- its just an enantiomer of another drug meaning it’s the same chemical structure just different in mirror arrangement of the atoms, i the case of Lunesta the other enantiomer is inactive so all Lunesta does is have a slightly lower dose and most importantly can be patented unlike the other drug, the commercial also has dangerous lies- says Lunesta is not habit forming, Lunesta is functionally a benzodiazepine structurally different, if taken long term it will cause potentially dangerous withdrawal, it should only be used short term or if longer term should only be used a few times a week to prevent a dependency, most doctors just read drug company literature and don’t have the knowledge to understand the technical details of what they are prescribing 

2. I don’t know how the healthcare system actually works in America just that it is extremely fucked and messed up (look up wallet biopsy), I don’t know how doctors charge, here in Canada doctors bill the government based on patient volume and certain procedures, therefore there is an incentive to see a large number of patients less time for each, prescribing psychiatric drugs is the quickest and laziest option for treating somebody, methadone clinics were giving people grossly excessive urine testing because they could bill for it, prescribing a psychiatric drug is the quickest, easiest, way to start treatment 

3. Even if psychiatrists agree on psychological factors being important, everything the biology and psychology is placed on the patient alone, people are uncomfortable and don’t want to look into the society/political and economic factors that lead into these issues, also doctors can get in huge trouble for not following a politically correct agenda, ie psychiatrist here lost his clinic for refusing to identify young children as transgender and encourage them to identify with there sex, my psychiatrist is now private and we can talk openly without the political correctness which prevents us from openly discussing issues

I guess I’m just trying to say I’m very disappointed with psychiatry, but there are good psychiatrists out there or ones who want to do good but the system is broken, psychiatry and the medical industry as the whole needs to reform 

Psychiatry should be a purely consensual thing between a doctor and client, accurate information needs to be given and it needs to be more holistic

Therapist was awesome too they both keep little paper records as possible, as well as “lose them” If supeoned 

So look for somebody older, and also can help if can relate gender and culture, somebody new is often inexperienced and arrogant imo not all but it seems it takes experience in the field to be humbled"
Antipsychiatry,es2q3rj,t3_c5h6hq,1561534504.0,"I have an amazing psychiatrist. Only problem is he’s a nonogenarian, so being honest with my self I’m going to sadly miss him soon, and I’ll try to see if he has anybody he can reccomend for me, family doctor is awesome too and handles Rx, psychiatrist is cool and old enough to recognize opioids are useful in drug resistant cases, and the problems are from restrictions, used to be a methadone Dr and is frustrated that he can’t prescribe Diacetylmorphine and MDX can’t be used legally (cool with my off Rx use of m and k because I don’t abuse those) and that because of scrutiny by college of physicians it’s hard to find doctors to Rx opioids or other things like Ketamine, even fam doc nervous to raise my dose, so I have to work hard on my addiction and managing my dose

Good guy to talk too, understands the flaws in pure biopsych, it’s not just drug company greed it’s because society doesn’t want to answer hard questions about hypercapitalism, social ostracism, sexuality etc

Doesn’t talk down to me talks to me like a colleague

Understands the important mental health value of travel, environmental change, relationships, intimacy (when no gf for over a couple years sees the importance in escorts and related)

Need to find more like him, and society needs to see more like us"
