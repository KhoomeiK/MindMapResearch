Marinate in vegetable or whatever oil, balsamic, mcormics montreal seasoning and then grill over a charcoal BBQ.  Omg it's delicious and you can diced them up for an amazing hash for breakfast or serve them along side so many meals, eat them on their own, blend them into purees, add them to soups and much more but the best part is you can freeze them in smaller containers and take them out as needed.  As for the leftover red onions and radishes, you could also use some carrots and cabbage... make some bomb pickled and or fermented sides that can last week's to months in the fridge.  My kimchi is going on a year and it's so delicious, I love that strong sour and spicy kick with everything.  Anyways , that's how I do it and those are my favorite ways to eat a variety of veggies everyday.  I also make all my dogs food with quality human grade ingredients that's a 50%protien/meat/fish, 20% rice or other starch and 30% seasonal veggies.  The BBQ is also her FAVORITE flavor and I can grill her some salmon, burgers and chicken while I'm at it to feed and then pack up and freeze for the following days or months.  Sorry if that was a rant, I just am really into food and I just learned how to BBQ with charcoal because my husband usually does the BBQ and I do the kitchen but not anymore!

They are literally pulling their hair out to get the kids back to school, activities and out of the house and for her to go back to work where she can micromanage her own employees.  Gawd, it's a migraine just visiting them and I am always visibly shaking by the time I leave.  I love them but... Man...  On the other hand, I love a quiet life, I'm a disabled vet with my best friend dog and my husband who is active duty.  I'm LOVING not having to go shopping, groceries, prescriptions, packages, even alcohol, all delivered right to my door and I don't even have to change out of my jammies and robe to make polite conversation even though it gives me anxiety and I hate small talk.  And instead of going to the VA and Vet Center 3+ times a week, it's all over the phone and I don't have to deal with traffic, my PTSD is better than it's been in years and people finally avoid me as much as I have always avoided them without being offended....  I kinda like and honestly I think we should stay this way until it's safe but people like my brother's family are fighting hard to get back to their normal and less stressful life's.  I also really appreciate the front line people who are putting themselves and their families health at risk to keep us stocked with food, driving tucks of produce and medical products, doctors, nurses, therapists, pharmacist, veteranarians, and construction workers.

CPTSD,fqcj26w,t1_fqccmxf,1589259508.0,"This is very similar to my story, I was in the military with these unhealthy, codependant survival instincts.  And they did work and keep me more safe but also put in very vulnerable positions and ended up having lifelong effects.   Trying to keep everyone else happy to make me feel safe sucked the life out of me.  My health took a huge toll after a deployment and stressful missions.  I too had to let go of my career, friends and many family when I stopped being able to put them first.  Because people who are used to walking all over you will put up a fight when you actually give them boundaries.  I lost my Dad, Mom and one of my 8 siblings.  But my life is so much less stressful. Yet even with that, my health will never be what it was and I can never do everything I used to do which is sooo infuriating and gives me deep shame.  It's a never ending cycle but I wouldn't go back to being physically healthy but emotionally numb and empty for anything.

YouShouldKnow,fq7uufq,t3_gh26ep,1589152673.0,"I actually did this when I was new dog Mom (I rescued a 6/7 year old neglected angel/more like she rescued me), and everytime the vet said, ""she was fine, all her labs and x-rays came back clean"" I left with $500 in bills.  I'm not complaining about money because her life is worth more than any amount of money, I would sell my car or take out a second mortgage if she needed.  Anyways turned out some dogs do a day of fasting and it's completely natural and is just a little reboot for their energy.   It took me a couple years to really get that and now I don't stay up at night worried or put more cheese on her food begging her to eat.  She does it every week or two or three but it NEVER goes over two days and when it went I a day and a half I took her in again lol.  She was fine and is fine, she's perfect actually!!!  All I'm trying to say is every dog is different just like people and we can't think every dog is like our last.  When or if I get another dog and he/she stops eating I will STILL take them to the vet just to make sure, because that can and will be the difference between a family member you bring home and one that stays gone forever.  My hypochondriacness for my dog actually did work out because when she started displaying what I felt was stress and pain (no one else noticed anything different), I took her in to the ER and found out she had moderate/severe hip dysplasia and a partial tear in her ACL.  She's had three knee surgeries and that's only three because I listened to my husband on the second one and he said to get the tight rope instead of the TPLO (she an 80lb, 11 y/o bulldog) because it was $3,000 cheaper and like I thought, it busted within 6 months so she had to go back in and get the TPLO.  I'll never again listen to ANYONE else when it comes to my families health and have learned to trust my instincts when I feel something is wrong.  Sometimes it's just a fast but sometimes I'm saving her from immense pain and possible fatal injuries.  She's medicated, eating well (I make all of her food from real organic produce and meats, I also eat the same things but with onions and spice) and my vet said she's the most medically challenged dog he's ever seen but she's lucky to have me watching out for her.  That meant the world to me coming from such a stoic vet and gave me more of a backbone when it came to her needs vs. other people's under reactions/apathy.  When I adopted my Peaches, she backed my family and I hope anyone else who adopts an animal feels the same.  No one in their right mind would let their family suffer."

recipes,fornnxh,t3_g95inw,1588015307.0,"JapChae is my favorite banchan!  Lookup Maangchi on YouTube's recipe, it's the cats meow!!  You can also just do the glass noodles mixed with (brown sugar, soy sauce, sesame sauce) instead of adding the veggies for a more versatile simple version that goes great with everything even soups and stews.   Also a green onion slaw, blanched sprouts and sesame oil+seeds, fish pancake, Gyeram Mari (Korean egg roll), cold Brazilian mashed potato salad (delicious), and so many more!  Message me if you have questions or need more ideas, I lived in Korea and now always try to keep Banchan in the fridge."

MealPrepSunday,forjg2g,t3_g8snu2,1588013255.0,That looks super flavorful!  Is it baked chicken and then you get the potatoes in the chicken drippings?

asianeats,fnhbgj6,t1_fma15ub,1586959152.0,This is the recipe I use too and I ALWAYS get lots of compliments on it.  I make mine a little extra saucy by using a bit more kimchi base to veggies.

raisedbynarcissists,fmxqib2,t1_fmxo19o,1586469916.0,"I'm in the exact same boat, DID is so misunderstood, I rarely tell anyone that I have it.  It's easier to just keep it to myself and therapist, I don't need the judging and scrutiny from the public."
raisedbynarcissists,fmxneeo,t1_fmxhzki,1586468245.0,"Thank you for this, I suffer from dissociative disorders BECAUSE of the abuse I was chronically subjected to by my psychopathic Mother.  Who absolutely knew she was hurting me and enjoyed every bit of it.  She wasn't dissociative, she was evil pure and simple.  I am dissociative and would NEVER hurt another loving being/creature."

Oh and her favorite grab, twist and drag me by my hair, slamming my head into walls, fences, doors, whatever.  I don't understand how anyone could treat their own flesh and blood with such vindictive hatred.  I never asked to be born but boy did she love making me regret even existing."
raisedbynarcissists,fmxlucf,t1_fmwx4xw,1586467411.0,"My NMom did the same thing!  Sometimes SHE would even start crying while beating me because of how much I hurt HER by making her punish me.... 🙄.   That was a total mind fuck as a child, being beaten and simultaneously dealing horrendous shame and guilt for hurting my Mother.  God I hate her so much, I haven't missed her a single bit since going no contact."
raisedbynarcissists,fmxl7se,t1_fmwm8we,1586467077.0,"You're a good sister, I'm glad you have each other.  I also protected my younger siblings and taking care of them actually kept me sane and gave my life purpose outside of the horrendous abuse.  One day the two of you can happily cut her out your lives and watch her squirm with the ""injustice"".  I did that and cut my NMom out about six years ago and it's the best feeling to not have that fear anymore. Knowing every positive event/accomplishment just eats at her because she can't take credit.  Uuggh the glory!  I know it's not really glorious but we have to find some humor and triumphs or we will get too lost in the pain and anger.  Best of luck to the both of you.  If you ever need to chat, advice or help please message me."

shittyfoodporn,fmwfc7o,t1_fmv6sze,1586445568.0,"I did the same thing, not sure why such an old post popped up in my feed but oh well!  No, there's nothing stopping you from going off base and honestly Korean food is my favorite cuisine.  But the American style restaurants are non existent their and you have to get a cab off base, so it's a whole ordeal.  It's easy, close and reminds you of home.  We do go off base A LOT though, Brazilian food and beef on a leaf (Bolgulgi, Kalbi, etc) are everywhere in Songtan and DELICIOUS.  There's still a whole base of airmen to keep Chilli's packed at all hours."
blunderyears,fmtfvl2,t3_fx67qi,1586372016.0,Can we see a current pic for comparison?
tifu,fmtc2ry,t1_fmqp3oh,1586370231.0,Actually I was thinking she felt really bad for OP crying and looking like a deer in the headlights.  Then when the lady gets home she can call her insurance and say it was like that when she got home and didn't notice it before she left.  My insurance would cover that and it wouldn't hurt me at all to do so.

worldnews,fmo4fpb,t1_fmo2b7j,1586245013.0,"Thank you so much, that means a lot.  This is a whole new ball game for everyone and I'm fortunate enough to not have that much extra stress atm.  I'm sorry that's really rough with your spouse being sick.  I'm not sure if it's something you would be interested in but, there are few online therapists and maybe your therapist is on call for over the phone sessions?  I'm very fortunate and have many veteran mental health resources available to me.  I hope you can find a support group either through social media or private groups.  It's not easy to ask for help, seeing as how you had just started therapy this can be a bit discouraging but keep seeking support.  You deserve it and there are other people who can benefit from your experiences also. If you are also a veteran DM me and I can hook you up with some programs and options available to you.   Best of luck man, these are crazy times for sure."

aww,fmm2iau,t1_fmlr7o4,1586197576.0,"You can neglect, emotionally and physically abuse a dog without the next owner knowing.  They just think their new dog has ""problems"".  The dog can't speak for itself and tell anyone what happened, it's really heart wrenching.  I rescued my dog from a ""friend"" who very clearly neglected and abused her, she has some very obvious signs and fears of certain situations and people.   I never leave my dog outside, I'm always watching her and she's always with me or locked in the house with nanny cams for few hours.  She's very beautiful, even though she's an 80lb pitbull, people are always stopping and commenting about how sweet and pretty she is.  Pitbulls have gone missing in close neighborhoods and about 45 mins away, they found the bodies of tons of Pitbulls that were injured and then used as bate for their hunting dogs.  I would never forgive myself, she is my family and I take my job of protecting her from psychos very seriously."

Only to pay their employees under minimum wage and over charge the troops.  That's pretty much every contract the government has, they pay $1,000 for a $20.00 office chair, I shit you not.  I have seen the invoices....  Thanks for the patriotism though, THAT does mean alot to our military."
