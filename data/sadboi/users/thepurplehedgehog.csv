Ask Him to come in ✅

Confess that you’ve sinned and ask for forgiveness ✅

A yell of OH SHIT then silence. And his mum, being out looking then falls ill, home alone ill and going out of her mind with worry.  What must have been going through their minds, I can’t even begin to imagine. I hope and pray they find him and can bring him home, in whatever way they can."

However, he did do well with the Panodrama documentary where he exposed John Sweeney and the BBC."
