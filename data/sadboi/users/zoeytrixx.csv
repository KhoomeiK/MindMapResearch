So far, my PCP told me my medication shouldn‚Äôt be an issue, then my psychiatrist said I should stop taking all of it. When I asked what will happen if I have an episode or a seizure he said that‚Äôs between me and my neurologist (I don‚Äôt have one.) Next, the RN at the OB‚Äôs office told me all my medication should be fine and that it‚Äôs more important for me to stay healthy and sane. Finally the OB said they don‚Äôt know what to do about my medication and referred me to a high-risk OB, who I won‚Äôt be seeing until the end of April. They did tell me that there‚Äôs a chance my baby will need to be in the NICU to detox after it‚Äôs born, and in that case I probably won‚Äôt be able to breastfeed.

So, right now I‚Äôm torn about what I should be doing. I don‚Äôt know if I should be trying to reduce my medication or what. As far as my mental state, I‚Äôm confident I can take care of the baby as long as I stay on my meds. I‚Äôd like to think my maternal instinct will trump whatever kind of episode I would have if I went off, but that‚Äôs definitely a risk. My boyfriend has depression but that‚Äôs it, so I know I can rely on him if something happens to me and that‚Äôs kind of my safety net. 

Since you both have schizoaffective disorder, that‚Äôs something you need to figure out together. If you feel that one of you will be able to take care of the baby if the other is having an episode, then my biggest advice is to find out if your medication is safe."
