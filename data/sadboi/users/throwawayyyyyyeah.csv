AmItheAsshole,fpyo2ef,t3_gg6d4l,1589006977.0,YTA. I thought this was the TIFU subreddit at first glance while scrolling through my feed. Dude... c’mon.
relationship_advice,fov7ccm,t3_g9j503,1588096561.0,"I think it’s really unfair and inappropriate that your mom consistently puts you in this position. It’s absolutely reasonable for you to set your own firm boundaries with both your sister AND your mom... regardless of the circumstances. You and your boyfriend have every right to be angry with her. Other people have said that she’s sexually harassing your boyfriend and they’re absolutely right... it’s disgusting and so incredibly disrespectful. Also, does she have her own apartment? You’re mom said that she “can’t be alone” in quarantine and that’s fucking ridiculous. Plenty of people are alone right now and surviving. As a 28-year-old woman, she can make due. If she doesn’t have any relationships that she can rely on to talk to via social media outlets (which wouldn’t surprise me), that’s on her."
AmItheAsshole,foke4o4,t3_g7swpo,1587840381.0,"NTA. Someone probably already said this, but it’s also likely that your SIL would not receive the quality care that she deserves if she were to live with you. It’s sounds like an everyone loses situation. The reality is that you’re only human and even if both you and your husband try your very best, your attention will be split four ways. It’s possible that her special needs simply won’t be met - and not for lack of trying. I think that this point might be helpful to bring up to your husband. It sounds like you both care about her needs and he should consider the reality of the situation. Of course it’s also likely that she won’t have her needs met by his parents as they grow older and it makes perfect sense that they have a chance to rest in the next chapter of their lives.

I used to work for a non-profit organization that provides day services for adults with developmental and intellectual disabilities. It allowed the participants to have lots of interactions with caretakers as well as other adults with disabilities. Recreational activities were provided and day trips for fun outings around the city. It was wonderful to see that there are people that are truly passionate about providing care for people in this population - and taking advantage of similar programs could really improve her quality of life beyond basic care. Perhaps you could look for such opportunities in addition to assisted living facilities and present these options to your husband.

Good luck to you! I’m sure this is a hard conversation to have."
AmItheAsshole,fnuyjqi,t3_g3rsmk,1587274650.0,"You’re most definitely the asshole. Also, it’s super douchey of you to keep track of how much you paid for her supplies and use that as an excuse for this choice. And it was also annoying when you put quotes around “hobbies,” almost implying that you don’t see their value.... but then you sold them."
AmItheAsshole,fnaqbev,t3_g0dx7x,1586801945.0,Definitely NTA. They seem really entitled. I think they should have to pay for their own or at least humble themselves to ask for help from your parents.
AmItheAsshole,fmvf0jz,t3_fxbnct,1586414720.0,This is fucked up and made me really uncomfortable. Your “kid B” is going to remember this.
AmItheAsshole,fmkbjyc,t3_fvo53k,1586149737.0,You deserve much better. NTA. I hope you find someone that can make you feel truly loved unlike this prick.
relationship_advice,fjpsl5y,t1_fjnobtc,1583559794.0,"I’m a big believer in therapy. I read above that you said your husband wasn’t really excited about that idea. If you’re able to convince him to come for a few sessions, you never know what may come out in a conversation with someone acting as a mediator. My husband and I have a therapist that we both love and respect - but it didn’t start out that way. It took some time to get my husband in the door, but now we both view therapy as an invaluable resource for strengthening our relationship. And of course... growth never stops. If your husband isn’t willing to budge - I think the only answer is to push. If you don’t, as others have said, it seems like he will unlikely be flexible regardless of the circumstances. I’m really sorry you’re in this position. I hope that your husband becomes more open to communication and is able to acknowledge YOUR (and your family’s) needs too."

childfree,ffccvuh,t1_ffbnes9,1579796725.0,"Your Mom’s response is amazing. I’m sorry your PIL have been so pushy. That sounds really uncomfortable... “give us any kids you don’t want,” wtf. I totally understand the worry of hurting parents that want grandchildren. While we’re very certain of our choice, it’s still a feeling that I carry unfortunately. Whenever you do decide to tell them, I hope it goes well and you have the support you need to process everything afterwards! It sounds like you do 🖤

I’m really hoping that my parents will have a similar response to your Mom’s but my Mom is the one I’m worried about. I think she knows deep down that we don’t want kids but I’m also nervous about “breaking the news” because of her feelings. I’ve made indirect comments like you mentioned and she still drops bingos left and right. Our Christmas gathering this year was... interesting. I think we just need to rip the bandaid off? Oh man.

I wish you the best of luck when your time comes! Thank you for your encouragement :)"
childfree,ff9wc7z,t1_ff9i7nb,1579722934.0,"You’re right, it doesn’t need to be a huge deal. I think I’ve been anxious about how they’ll react, but it’s possible that they’ll be understanding and supportive. I shouldn’t assume the worst. I’m glad your parents have been respectful of your choice!"

depression,fbtfomu,t3_ee58qm,1577077278.0,"I just want to say that I’m so sorry you’re being treated this way. Your feelings are valid, not something to laugh about. It may not feel possible right now, but someday your mom won’t be able to hurt you anymore."
oddlysatisfying,fbngjlp,t1_fbnfe4n,1576997452.0,"Haha, true. Not opposed to the shape. It’s purely a texture issue for me with fruit... but with bananas I also hate the taste and the smell. Sensory hell."

oddlysatisfying,fbndms9,t1_fbnc8y4,1576996156.0,I don’t care for fruit either. But I think they’re nice to look at.... except bananas. I fucking hate bananas.

AmItheAsshole,fbhmijf,t3_ed3zth,1576877205.0,"I’d say you’re NTA. Its absolutely okay to tell her that the picture makes you uncomfortable.... especially since it’s a professional relationship. But honestly it’s always okay to tell someone that you’re uncomfortable. I don’t think people do it often enough - myself included. 

I think it would have been better to be honest and share your feelings than to make up a story about your wife - who is not involved at all. Then the client’s response is out of your hands. If she can’t respect your boundary by communicating via email instead, then maybe it’s better to cut your losses. 

Good luck, man."
AmItheAsshole,f9vqqyb,t3_e6yh9z,1575677223.0,"NTA. Your mom has no right to talk to you or anyone else that way. It sounds like she has some serious self-love issues and is projecting her insecurities on you and other family members. 

My mom sounds very similar to yours. In recent years I’ve begun to set boundaries with my Mom. It took me a long time (and therapy) to realize that I’d been verbally, emotionally, and psychologically abused for most of my life. I was HER emotional support throughout childhood and into adulthood. When I finally said no more and that I needed time apart, my Dad turned against me. My brother didn’t want to get involved and my extended family had a very specific picture of the situation since my Mom told them all how I had treated her. 

Apparently isolation is a big part of emotional abuse and my therapist told me to prepare for this when I made the decision to set boundaries. GOOD NEWS however... after about a year, my brother (my only other sibling) and I have gotten a lot closer and have been able to process some of these similar experiences together. We realized that our Mom had been pinning us against each other for years (triangulation, another sign of emotional abuse) so that she was always perceived as the “good guy.” Maybe somewhere down the road, you’ll be able to connect with and support your sisters in this shared experience.

I love my parents and they’re still in my life, but my Mom knows now that I won’t tolerate hurtful criticism and I am careful to avoid being manipulated by her (which is really hard sometimes). 

Enough about me. My point is... you don’t deserve this treatment. Your words toward her may not have been productive but I ABSOLUTELY  understand your reaction and where your hurt comes from. Maybe writing your feelings down would be helpful? Even if your words aren’t sent to her... getting them out on paper can be really therapeutic. And who knows, maybe what comes out might be something you want to share with her when the time is right. I hope this is helpful."
AskReddit,f9iked3,t3_e51fyc,1575339279.0,"I would be thrilled if my Grandma’s painting was returned to me. 

Earlier this year, my basement storage unit was broken into and among other things - a beautiful acrylic piece painted by my grandma was taken. She told me that this was her first acrylic piece and that it gave her enough confidence to keep painting. Several months later she passed away. She was a very talented artist and my family is fortunate to have many other pieces that she created. 

I like to think that the person who took it could recognize it’s beauty (even if they were just planning to hawk it). I really hope that it’s hanging in someone’s home right now."
