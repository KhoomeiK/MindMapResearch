Take out a LISA (if available - can be used towards first house or as pension) and look into accounts like monzo that let you set savings goals so you can organise your money.

oddlyweird,fqhwzel,t1_fpwe5y9,1589386056.0,Nature and nurture. You can work at it by increasing stretching exercises but the extent that you could possibly reach at peak will be defined by your genetics. Maybe you're hypermobile and your ligaments/tendons can flex on a larger scale than others. You could have the best training in the world but not necessarily reach the same level of flex as this woman. But you could certainly train to be more flexible than your baseline.

I didn't realise assholes had been using ""bisexual"" as a way to marginalise transfolk. If you're bi and just into binary genders (male/female) then your prospective partners still include trans people. But if your pan then you don't give a crap about your prospective partners gender then you can experience any gender on the rainbow spectrum of choice. That right?"

UKPersonalFinance,fpo7s0x,t1_fpnj2xq,1588779852.0,Exactly. And this is mindset I'm trying to cultivate. That the money is there for a reason. But I think for me to keep at it small goals with treats is the way to keep me engaged. Monzo really helps me in that regard as I can set up a savings pot with a goal in mind or set myself spending limits. Whereas the boring savings stuff I set to automatically go into an account I don't touch. So I've lived without that money touching my wallet so to speak so I don't miss it. Then I have that nice cushion for emergencies without me suffering in the present.
UKPersonalFinance,fpo75tz,t1_fpn4oxd,1588779553.0,Any time I get a letter about my help to buy ISA it's only to say the rate has decreased.

It builds up in the background in case of emergencies. But little funding goals for holidays or treats are much more satisfying."
UKPersonalFinance,fpo6qgc,t1_fpn4ee8,1588779342.0,I've looked at budget stuff before and think I spend about 60% of my surplus cash on food! But I do love it.
UKPersonalFinance,fpo5u8k,t1_fplp2c4,1588778896.0,Yea exactly. My partner is lucky to have a good amount of savings from family. I wasn't that lucky so had to start from scratch. It's not a life changing amount but it will certainly help if anything was to happen like and emergency or losing my job.
UKPersonalFinance,fpo5n1l,t1_fplrth8,1588778797.0,That's really great! I've definitely had those moments. Like when university gave some non-repayable grants out that were between ¬£400-1000 I couldn't honestly tell you what I spent that on. But now I would definitely save it. Maybe it wouldn't go on boring savings or emergency funds but at least it would go towards a holiday or something I could actually quantify.

morbidquestions,fpdrfbk,t3_gcnpu9,1588532716.0,"Many people have stated about risk of infection, the variables involved etc. 
Something else to consider, in hospital if you came in with a foreign object impaled through your palm they're going to want to do and x-ray to check there's no major damage to tendons, blood vessels, bones etc before removal. If you're lucky and it misses all that then they're gonna pull it out and clean it up. Likely give you some stitches, an empirical course of antibiotics, tentanus shot and a follow up to check your hands mobility. If we're saying a chunk of hand is removed cookie cutter style, then the same applies but healing may be affected dependent on what injured the hand. A hot poker through the palm? Likely cauterized the wound so not as much risk of infection but healing will be limited due to dead tissue. Some sharp object is responsible and there's some remaining skin? Hospital could stitch it up and maybe have some input from plastics to cover it up, but there's gonna be a prolonged healing process and scarring which may affect functionality or sensation."

morbidquestions,foz0kbc,t3_ga46km,1588182592.0,"Yes and no. Some people are talking about snake venom which would only be deadly if injected (or at least as far as I'm aware. I'm no expert in reptiles, just a lowly scientist). My friend wanted to look at studying snake venom. Due to its clotting properties it could be useful in certain bleeding disorders (look up vids on snake wranglers, it's horrible how snake venom kills you). 

Certain poisons can be taken orally in small/frequent enough doses to build up a tolerance (IIRC there was a king who did this then couldn't kill himself as he had built up a tolerance). 

However there's an old toxicology saying that ""the dose makes the poison"". Meaning I could give you anything and in a high enough dose it could kill you. The opposite is used in medicine, that some medications derived from plants were previously viewed as poisonous or deadly but given in the correct form/dose can be used to treat illnesses. Digoxin is a good example of this.

Edit- adding to this that you're not likely to develop antibodies to snake venom - you need anti venom. Some people are genetically more resistant to poison or venoms so in a small number of cases their blood could be used to manufacture an antivenom or to treat a person who happened to also be the correct blood type but very slim chance of that. What I think you're getting mixed up with is something called 'first principles'. We're looking at it now to treat covid and use it for other diseases. A pt who has recovered from a disease will have antibodies to that disease so you can extract their plasma and use it to treat others by effectively giving them an immunity. Look up smallpox/cow pox history to give you an idea of how this can work."
