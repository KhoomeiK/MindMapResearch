rape,fqegcop,t3_giexps,1589307096.0,"This is horrible and I'm so sorry that you had to go through this! I'm only getting to the stage you are now, not thinking about it every few seconds and it is improving with time and therapy. I get the whole struggling with the ""survivor label"" too. Ever since being raped ive struggled with any connotations of being weak as I felt weak and pathetic in that moment. Keep going and thanks so much for sharing your story ‚ù§Ô∏è"
acturnips,fpndifu,t1_fpndgfq,1588759083.0,Will tip!
acturnips,fpndgfq,t3_geg9t4,1588759024.0,Poppy! And Ted!
BPD,fn8e23s,t3_fzwrh9,1586739562.0,Oh god this is so true. Have always felt the desire for this and still relish the moments in which it has happened. I think like that often about my boyfriend and others. Always feel so guilty about thinking that way afterwards.
BPD,fdv0lal,t3_emsnuu,1578741776.0,"Yes. It's horrific. Life is entirely a blur and my excessive drinking to block out things didn't help either. I often find myself lying about remembering things and feel sad and guilty that I don't have those memories people speak so fond of. 
Unfortunately the bad memories tend to be the ones I've clung on to. I'm starting to forget things from a couple of years ago too, my partner talks so nicely about our first date but to me, I can remember bits but not as clearly as he can. It's so frustrating."
BPD,fduzh7t,t3_en4qof,1578741375.0,Sounds like you still mean a lot to him. But you can't be anyone's friend or have a future with anyone if you're not here. Prioritise your self and force yourself to eat and do some self care. You don't deserve the punishment you're inflicting on yourself and life is much bigger than one relationship. I went through something similar a few years back and I wish someone had said that to me. I starved myself for too long and punished myself for too long for something I had no control over and have to live with the consequences now.  You can get through this. Reach out to others and surround yourself with love. X
BPD,f9n5wn6,t3_e5rgnt,1575477687.0,Feel this. Constantly doubting if I actually mean things or if I'm just an attention seeking bitch and I despise myself for it
BPD,f7z7330,t3_dy13tj,1574106378.0,Oh god this is so relatable
rape,f7xpigz,t3_dxzkbk,1574068473.0,This is what im struggling with at the moment. Very similar situation. I've been recommended EMDR or exposure therapy. I suggest you seek it out too. X good luck
highthoughts,f5ghrt6,t3_dnvlqt,1572193463.0,Oh my god. The devil one is amazing. Is that the burning rainforest? üòØüò≠
BPD,f32g63j,t3_df434t,1570607664.0,"It's the people that all of a sudden have a mental health issue on awareness days that piss me off, they usually call it depression or anxiety (it's more often than not just the blues or nerves) and say how they suffer from it, how eating and exercise has helped and that they are sending positive vibes to other sufferers. They usually get a ton of likes and then they never speak on it again, until the following year. I know it's hard to tell if someone is really suffering but the people that do this on my timeline I know personally and it's just what they're like."
rape,f2xcaop,t3_dej15e,1570476298.0,"I was raped and orgasmed during it. Now I struggle to orgasm full stop and when I do it's exhausting and tends to make me cry in shock. I was convinced for years that I liked really rough sex and sought it, putting myself in horrific situations to get it. Since meeting my loving boyfriend and being diagnosed with BPD I am coming to terms with the fact that I'm traumatised and that I'm not this monster that only enjoys violent sex. 
But I'm still struggling with that. 
I recently shared this with a sex therapist for the first time (first time I'd spoken on it) and she told me it's actually really common for rape victims to idealise rough sex especially if they have orgasmed. (Which is really screwed up!) 
Seek professional help but hope this helped."
BPD,f2btyde,t3_dcpplz,1570130920.0,What helped me the most when I went through something similar a couple of years back was just keeping busy. I spent hardly any time alone. I joined any groups I could and pushed myself to spend time with friends who I may have lost contact with/strangers who became friends. I literally went to everything! I was a social butterfly. It made me more independent and then I was able to meet someone when I could stand on my own two feet that made being in a relationship a lot easier.
BPD,f2bs759,t1_f2brz5y,1570130338.0,"Oh and I write it the evening before and don't add to it throughout the day so I don't feel like things are piling up. If something comes up, its first thing on tomorrow's list"
BPD,f2brz5y,t3_dco42l,1570130248.0,"I've found giving myself a manageable to do list each day means I tick off a few things and don't feel so guilty when I feel like that. By manageable I mean like one or two tasks a day, and if I get more done that's a bonus. Its helped me prioritise what is important for that day too-( I tend to procrastinate or pick things that are easier to do even if there is something more pressing) . I stick the to do list by my bed so when I wake up it's the first thing I do. The first one is always get up and have a shower."
BPD,f1w251f,t3_dax3wr,1569779212.0,"Yes yes yes, ruined a good number of years because of this."
BPD,f0wdgx6,t3_d6smm7,1569004901.0,"Hadn't even realised it but this is a think for me too. Especially at work. People I perceive as 'weaker' than me (sorry bad word use) I completely take charge, but if I think the person is better than me I do everything to avoid them and get nervous in there presence. Its like my brain doesn't want me to progress."
BPD,f0rd40p,t3_d64uci,1568880418.0,You need to get her into DBT and perhaps buy a book on it yourself so you know coping methods. It's the only way to manage this.
BPD,f0jo1jr,t1_f05po5p,1568658834.0,"Exactly, me too"
rape,f0jnyn6,t3_d4n0eh,1568658770.0,"Thank God she has found you, someone who will take her interests in to account. I still struggle with this and my partner does what you do too but it doesn't make them stop. I went to a sex support group recently and they stress how normal this is for rape survivors. It's also normal to struggle to orgasm or feel guilty when you do. It was good just to hear I wasn't alone so maybe suggest she looks into one of those. I think it is something that only she can work on over time, it's about forgiving yourself and trying to associate sex with anything other than that event.  Try your best to continue to make her feel comfortable and special and ask her what the best positions are for her to feel most safe (a lot of rape survivors cannot stand certain positions). Sounds like you're doing a lot already though."
BPD,f04s2vf,t3_d3qstl,1568394346.0,Oh god most of my clothes are from when I've had an episode and convinced myself that clothes could make me feel better (they never do). I also tend to buy huge presents for friends last minute (way over what is expected) and when I have little money. Didn't realise this was impulsive until I got diagnosed.
BPD,ezu9et3,t3_d2bgi1,1568147824.0,This is it exactly. Thanks x
BPD,eyzy8a6,t1_eyxg8om,1567626782.0,This exactly.
BPD,eyzy2nn,t3_cz7fiz,1567626705.0,I do this with complete strangers but find it hard with friends. Strange.
HousingUK,exeebpd,t1_ex2v50p,1566211828.0,"If you would be willing to share what the pressures are on housing options officers and what limitations there are in the system, you can email me on [charlottemaher@tbij.com](mailto:charlottemaher@tbij.com) I think it is important to hear how people working directly with the act feel about it. If you do not want to email- you can call me on 02038927495."
Assistance,exeatza,t1_ex6btfx,1566206980.0,"At the moment, yes. We will be looking into Scotland at a later date so if there is anything you want to flag, please do so."
HousingUK,ex2tlov,t1_ex2s8q9,1565975098.0,"Thank you for doing that. It is absolutely fine that you did it anonymously, we are just trying to see how councils across the country are treating those in need. Any information you gave about your own experiences will be super helpful in holding those to account."
BPD,evfov4z,t3_cjohuy,1564499020.0,"I have had this since I was little (23 now). For me it was always focused on my family but hurt the most when focused on my little brother (feel responsible for him). It has now shifted on to my FP as I have moved away from home and I have the same panic that you described when he is away from me. My mum just put it down to usual nightmares when I was younger but always felt that it was strange that I had intense feelings and thoughts about it when I wasnt asleep. Its strange, I can focus on my own death without feeling but if I focus on any of my close family/FP passing- I cant describe the pain that causes me to feel."
BPD,evflfl4,t3_cjobpf,1564497498.0,This is great. Can definitely sympathise with you.
BPD,eublrxz,t3_cfiw05,1563651141.0,Use this myself it is great!
BPD,eublcuj,t3_cflnsr,1563650837.0,Also very bad at making decisions and tend to rely on my FP to make them for me. Does leave me feeling quite vunerable when he's not around though
BPD,etockpg,t3_ccjchq,1563023377.0,I think this is why I love films and books so much. It's a sense of escapism aswell. I'm someone else for abit. Someone more interesting.
BPD,et2qiu2,t3_c9rl71,1562420838.0,This is often one of the things I say to him when I'm feeling suicidal. He'd be happier if I'm not around idea.
BPD,esxcg3h,t3_c9c8hu,1562328570.0,I have often disassociated while driving and it's terrifying realising you're in your own head and not concentrating. I find loud music helps/radio with a conversation you can engage with playing. Pretend the DJ is in the car with you and talk back to him. Sounds crazy but it keeps me on earth for abit.
BPD,es9s7o8,t3_c6czui,1561743318.0,Happens to me too. It's so cruel. All you want is for someone to know how much pain you're in and you physically can't get the words out. I've cried before in frustration because my friend couldn't understand why i was in such a state
BPD,eq022no,t3_bwo3jg,1559676894.0,This is scarily accurate.
BPD,epw5zc5,t3_bw126c,1559566858.0,I can't upvote this enough.
BPD,epw5uvr,t1_eptt8bb,1559566744.0,My friends do this about when I have blacked out on alcohol in the past. It's something that is embarrassing for me but they think I'm just wild. They don't know I have BPD.
