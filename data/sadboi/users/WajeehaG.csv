Muslim,fl9jmy7,t3_fmg4qm,1584958727.0,"Even besides religion, drinking is wrong because of what it does to the human body. I know its easier said than done, but try to limit the cues that get you to party in the first place. Try to focus your energy on some goal or take up a new hobby. if you keep up drinking and partying, at some point, other fun things will dull in comparison to you and partying will become the only thing you enjoy. THAT IS DANGEROUS. Try to get your friends to hang out with you elsewhere, places without alcohol and stuff. Go hiking or travel or do things youve always wanted but still havent. And at the same time, pray to Allah, I know all of us should pray five times a day but it isnt easy. So just pray once even, once in a day, a few times a week, whatever is easy at the begining and pray to Allah, talk to him. Allah is very forgiving, open up to Him. Its hard not to indulge in such activities, especially when everyone arounf you is doing it, I get that. But Allah forgives, everytime you repent and decide you wont do it again, you will be forgiven, just know that and try to avoid these things best you can. If you slip and go back to them again, try again, never stop trying."
Muslim,fl9ja4a,t3_fnapuu,1584958280.0,"The physical stuff, dirty talking, touching etc is haram. You are allowed to have feelings for someone in Islam, but Islam offers a different way to act on those feelings. If you like someone and you know they're the one, ask them if they want to marry you and have a conversation and then tell your parents and get married and be happy. In many cultures, the concept of love marriage is shunned WHICH IS WRONG. Islam does NOT prohibit love marriage, it just prohibits you from acting on your lust before youre nikaahed."
Muslim,fl9j3wm,t3_fnhfit,1584958056.0,"Well, if the guy your sister is marrying doesnt seem like he'll stick around, i understand your concern. But at this point you cant do much, if you show your disapproval, it might push her away and end up doing more damage. right now, just let her do what she wants but keep encouraging her to apply for jobs and pursue a career at the same time. Marriage shouldnt have to be a compromise on her individuality and career growth. Just support her and guide her in her personal career goals. If the guy she wants to marry isnt good for her, she will see that in her own time, no family member can forcefully make her see the big picture. I know ive said it a lot but make sure all of you keep motivating her to work and achieve her individual goals. Every woman should become financially independent regardless of her marital status. Hope this helps"
