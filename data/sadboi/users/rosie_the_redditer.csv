One time I woke up in the middle of a panic attack and thought I needed to go to the ER because I was going to die in my sleep. These last 15-30 minutes with small flashes of panic for a few days afterward. Usually for a couple of days I feel sad, exhausted, and definitely agoraphobic.

I have always dealt with anxiety and periodic depression, but I had never experienced anything like this. I have since learned that I have Dissociation Anxiety.

If you think of smoking tell yourself ""I am not a smoker."" If you want to know how it effected your body and brain, use your recall. What I do when I can't remember how booze effected me is I ""play the tape forward."" I imagine I did drink, how it would go and how I would feel before, during, and after.

* Forgive yourself right away. Take some time looking at your family, your childhood, etc and you will probably see where a lot of it stems from. These are not excuses by any means, but they give you some perspective. Feeling guilty only causes further harm.
* Tell your significant other that you are going to need space as you work through this, in times when you feel triggered to react poorly. Then when you start to get upset, remove yourself from the situation. Sit with how you feel, do you feel it in your chest, in your face? Start to recognize the physical sensations that come before you react. You will be more able to know when it is happening and catch it earlier.
* Deep breaths and ""playing the tape forward."" Imagine if you said the things you were thinking of saying. Imagine it from the moment you speak the words, how you will feel in that moment and how you will feel 10 minutes later. It's not good. It's not worth that 2 seconds of whatever feeling you get from spewing the negativity into the world.
* Then, after you've had time to cool down, identify the underlying feeling. Maybe you were disappointed in what your SO did. Maybe you've had a hard day or are hungry. Talk to him about it, but not until you've had time to truly move past it and see it from the other side. The more you handle this successfully, the better chance you will have the next time. It is a positive feedback loop.
* Apologize and plan. If you mess up, apologize quickly. But don't just give an empty apology, bring a plan of action for how things will go differently next time.

Therapy fits in here as well, but I didn't start therapy until I had already made vast improvements in my anger response. So you can change if you're willing to stick to a plan."

I lift weights 4 days per week, ride my bike everywhere I go, and ride long distance on the weekends. I am at about 21% body fat, which is why I am focused on recomposition. I like the idea of splitting it up into 2 smaller meals, maybe between 2 hours."

BingeEatingDisorder,flv4jhz,t1_flu05hx,1585516215.0,"I appreciate what you are saying about not cutting sweets out completely. I have been moving slowly toward a more fresh or I guess most would say ""whole foods"" diet. I have cut out most packaged foods aside from these sweets. I guess I just feel like they're filled with empty calories. I gave up bread & pasta a few years ago and don't miss it at all one bit. But damn if I don't love a good ice cream.

Perhaps instead of cutting it out completely, I should just focus on not keeping it at the house. Then if I really MUST HAVE something sweet, I can go to the grocery store to buy that ice cream. And it will be less impulsive because of the time it takes to get there. I also might try to keep dark chocolate on hand instead, because I never feel like I want to binge on it due to the richness."

When my anxiety is at a bad point, I have a lot of behaviors that are associated with OCD, such as needing an organized space where everything is in its place, and feeling discomfort or dread until I perform a certain action. But I would not be classified as OCD because these behaviors don't cause a hinderance to me leading my life, and are nonexistent when I have my anxiety under control. Now that's not to say that OCD & BED can't coexist, because they definitely can. Much like my anxiety is partnered with substance abuse disorder."

nonprofit,flncyvk,t3_fnd7av,1585315765.0,"Hi everyone. As is common with many nonprofits, this is a big time of year for us to host events. We have a weeklong series of events in May each year that promote physical activity and alternative transportation (we're bike, walk, & transit advocates). We're likely going to have to postpone our week of events to the fall due to COVID-19, but want to do something in the meantime. We are trying to come up with some virtual events to host when we would have been holding our events to keep people engaged. They don't need to make money, as the focus of our normal week of events is community engagement rather than fundraising (we usually break even).

One we are considering is asking people to take selfies while they're biking, walking, or doing any other physical activity and hashtag the pictures with the normal event name. People will earn points and we'll have a drawing at the end of the week.

Here are my questions:

* What are you doing to keep people engaged? Are you using social media?
* Have you come up with any creative virtual event ideas?"

We have to practice compassion for ourselves at this time. You could try incorporating restful behaviors that aren't just spending the day in bed. Take a bath with some salt or some other special scented fun stuff, put on a face mask, do a stretch session while listening to some music that always make you feel better, etc. My pandemic toolkit includes self-care items and scheduling time into my day to just breathe and be with myself."
