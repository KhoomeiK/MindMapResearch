I've never been one for useless small talk (and I'm in the south, so it's kind of mandatory), so it's been nice having a reason to avoid people. I've never been very social, so now I have an excuse to stay home. I've finished 3 books, taken an online Spanish class, been taking walks, and play with my cats/play video games. It's been great having extra free time, but it also sucks because I'm stressed and worried (about my job, and about catching the virus or one of my family members catching it). It does feel a little insensitive to lament on the good things because people are dying, but I will say the break has been nice after working full time for over a decade with barely any time off."

I absolutely believe in science and I have sheltered in place as much as I can... but I also wonder IF it's bad enough that we've had to take such extreme precautions. I've been on voluntary furlough so far, but it is likely to become involuntary once toe govt money runs out. I'm devastated because I love my job and benefits. I also hate seeing my grandmother and her friends miss the little things like meeting for lunch. I'm happy they've been avoiding contact but I'm also sad for them because they are getting depressed stuck alone in their houses. I don't have an issue wearing masks or staying away from people but I miss my life as well. I used to travel everywhere (free flights) with my girl, going out places, hell I even miss the thrift stores. I just feel dirty when I go out now, just to the grocery store. I just miss the old ways.

I also wish I had siblings because even though I have some friends I don’t have any I consider super close which is my own fault because I tend to keep people at an arms length.
