MachinePorn,eudx1qe,t1_eucp8t1,1563729682.0,"What I need to be explained to me is how there are signs of gravity on the moon, but yet there is no gravity in space. Like when they did their walk and were jumping they came down they didn't keep going up, or get pushed away by the heat of the sun. Yet the American flag is flying at full mast and seems to have ripples in it from currents in space, but why are there none in their suits? It's a very odd circumstance and we will never know because ""they"" are the only ones capable of going to space."
