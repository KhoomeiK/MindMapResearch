mentalhealth,fmq9e0r,t3_fq47nx,1586295344.0,"I have three kids- a 5 year old, 3.5 year old and 8 month old. We are all safe and healthy but I keep feeling just profoundly sad. My husband works from home in tech. 

I’m so upset about everything we’re not able to do, and also overwhelmed with the feeling that I am stuck with these kids without much of a break for the next... forever. Don’t get me wrong, I love them to death but it’s just a lot. And I don’t feel like I have anything to look forward to because everything good is just cancelled for the foreseeable future. 

I do have anxiety/depression which I have taken Zoloft for forever and I see a counselor once a month, so I’ve felt this way before but my coping skills are being tested. Especially when it feels like there’s no end in sight and nothing to look forward to."
