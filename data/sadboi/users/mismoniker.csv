I have been able to sleep deeply for 7-8 hours with no interruption for two weeks now. It's... very weird. The situation right now is one of my worst nightmares, so much so that just a few years ago I went into a full blown episode with psychotic features. I was paranoid and delusional because thought something similar to what is happening now was about to happen then. But since starting pregabalin, I have barely felt any anxiety. It's so...weird, I'm not used to having any anxiety! Hoping everyone does their best to take care of themselves in the middle of this pandemic"

insomnia,fjpdwy8,t3_felinf,1583548299.0,"You may need to seek medical attention already. Something similar happened to me. I had rocky sleep quality for a month and a half, which culminated in two weeks with almost no sleep at all—maybe 1-3 hours if ever, but like you I had high feelings of anxiety which interfered with sleeping. It is not normal for a teenager, or for any human at all. My feelings of anxiety only worsened and became full-blown paranoia because of lack of sleep. I did not have headaches, but there was this strong, persistent throbbing inside my head, as if my brain was shrinking then expanding so much that it was pressing against my skull. I was brought to the emergency room, where doctors gave me valium and whatever drugs to get me to sleep but none of those worked. I was only finally able to sleep a full 8-hours when a psychiatrist correctly diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and gave me proper medications for that. My anxiety also diminished but never fully disappeared, but that's just how bipolar disorder is I guess.

Do you have any friends or classmates who have been diagnosed with a mental illness? If they can talk about it openly, perhaps they can send you the contact of the psychiatrist who diagnosed them. Do you have any close friends or family? When my anxiety was at its worst, having someone to vent to—a close friend who just basically listened and did not put me down or brush away my anxieties—helped a lot too. Hope the best for you!"
