I do kind of feel that i may need to be on the Invega as it has kept the microchip in my brain disabled for almost 2 years now but I would feel ""cleaner"" off all meds altogether, im also on gabapentin to help with the anxiety i get when im not drinking (so with a view toward helping me quit) and that might need to stay for now but overall yeah I'd like to be medfree i know its not without risks but neither is being ON meds i think everyone on neuroleptics should be aware of the impact they have on our bodies and brains and just what it is we are making the trade for."

I think I started to REALLY worry about being viewed as a malingerer when my inpatient psychiatrist told me pretty inexplicably (in my view) that I was unlike any schizophrenic patient she's had before - in that I told her my voices are the worst part of it - she claimed to never have ever heard that from any other schiz patient ever in all her years as a pdoc, yeah right, I CANNOT be the only one - and that my meds tend to stop working after a while and I either end up back in psych or need to switch, which I know just from reading this sub is not a totally unique experience.

Unpopular opinion I think but let's look at it this way - I'm currently hospitalized against my will for experiencing many bizarre and interesting things, most of them terrifying, some of which I recognize as what you might call hallucinations such as seeing blood on my face and people behind me in the mirror, and some which I fully 100% believe are real and simply not perceived by others.

I ate most of it. Then another victory, I actually went out to the garden (with security guards etc of course) because I was asked about THIS twice too. They NEVER ask anything twice and then two in one day! One guy got up and picked a dandelion and gave it to me. I rubbed the yellow in my notebook. I'm on page 33 which is how old Jesus was. So I think my nurse and the MHT who asked me about dinner are angels. I'm a little bit afraid/embarrassed to ask them.

Demons are telling me horrible things, threatening me and my loved ones, not allowing me to eat or leave my room and I have to sleep on the floor. I just made a post about this. 

I just realized that someone, at least one person, possibly (likely) more who works at the hospital is a robot planted by a coalition of government intelligence agencies that have been trailing me for years and surveilling me (Mossad/CIA/KGB) because there are cameras in the ceiling and so they had to know which room I was going to be in. Usually I can recognize the robots on sight but as far as I know I haven't seen one working here? So I'm confused.

I closed the shade on my window because I was seeing dead (?) people in the next building over, and we taped a towel over the TV and paper over the bathroom mirror because people were in them and (in the case of the bathroom) my face was bloody when I looked in it.

Psychosis,fqu4w8i,t3_gkysrd,1589652079.0,"Ugh I'm sorry that happened to you. I know you said it's now 6 mo on but how long did it take you to stop hearing the voices? 

I've experienced similar things - heard the voices of demons, angels, Saint Michael, my mom, my roommate and landlord (at the time) having a conversation, random people, a ghost, spirits, a multidimensional traveler hosted in my brain, and more. 

My parents are also involved in my issues but for me it's being told by demons that they are going to kill them and send them to hell if I don't carry out horrible acts. 

Good luck for the future! Was this a one time thing for you? Did you receive a diagnosis?"
schizophrenia,fqu43f2,t1_fqu3l0h,1589651638.0,"Thanks for reading and responding! 

I've challenged each of the rules on various occasions and the results have never been good. I know a lot of the stuff that happens to me isn't ""real"" but I 100% believe that the demons are, so I don't really dare push them too far. I don't even know the full extent of what they're capable of but clearly they have at least some influence on the physical world (see: shade slamming open after I ate the soup, this definitely happened and the nurse saw it too)."

I'd recommend seeing a professional - it's good to catch these things early. Could be nothing but it could be something, yaknow? 

Good luck."

I thought my coworkers were conspiring against me, there were sensors in the floors at work to track my movements, patterns in the floor were sending me hidden messages, the pizza delivery people were trying to collect my DNA, there were demons in my fan and outside the house trying to get in, birds were spying on me, I was being targeted by Mossad/the KGB/the CIA (still kinda believe this one), my parents were in danger too, I smoked pot once during this period and saw giant bugs crawling up and down the side of my neighbor's house, etc. It was a real mess. I finally got help in June but I was like this for months.

I've filled 14 pages in the last 19 hours (ordinary sized composition book). Then again, I'm currently in psych with nothing better to do. I used to aim for 20 a day while inpatient.

mentalillness,fqr22g2,t3_gk6rue,1589576145.0,"I have schizophrenia and have disclosed this to all my friends, a good portion of my family (all of my dad's side, none of my mom's), my boyfriend, and obviously my support structure including psychiatrist, psych nurse, three therapists (over a span of time... I only work with one), and three case managers (same deal there). 

I've lost a friend or two and have a few family members who treat me obviously differently, but overall people have been incredibly supportive and helpful. 

I'm on the fence about disclosing to employers - only if you think there's some reasonable accommodation you need due to your illness that they can provide, I would say. 

Overall disagree, but everyone's circumstances are different."
