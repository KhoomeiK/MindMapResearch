BPD,f3w5ana,t3_diek67,1571192363.0,"Absolutely. I thought I was the only one! I have films that I feel attached to like they’re an actual memory of my life that’s Happened, and programmes that soothe me or calm me. I get attached to characters and when seasons end I go into like a shock or mourning. DAE become obsessed with characters to the extent they seek out people IRL that could be their counterpart and try work them into your life? Maybe that’s me being too borderline, but all the yes to this post. 
Buffy the vampire slayer
The x files
Orange is the new black
Breaking bad
Stranger things

All of them made me feel involved and like I was part of that team"
BPD,f28i9f1,t3_dcaruf,1570062277.0,"Yes. My wife. We were together 4 years and married only 5 months before she decided she was in love with my best friend. This was 6 months ago. We’re still on speaking terms as we will need to divorce at some point but I can’t help but check up all the time. (I know this sounds like the usual borderline reaction to a breakup that was so recent) but I honestly don’t think this will ever leave me. 
Everyday at multiple points she runs across my mind. And not because I want her back but because she’s always going to be in my brain. I think once us borderlines have loved someone, there’s an invisible thread that will forever connect them to us in some way."
BPD,exrqail,t3_cu077z,1566521414.0,"Yes.  It happened all the time in all of
My previous relationships and one that just ended in March with my wife. I don’t think I ever rationally wanted to break up with her but when things were bad/it was one of those days/we were arguing I definitely felt “this is pointless. This won’t work, I’m not happy” and would throw words around in my distress and turmoil like “I need to move out” “have my ring back” “it’s not going to work” sometimes when emotions have escalated to such a point of crisis I think those feelings and words appear in place of the real problem or issue which is the usually the fact that I wasn’t comfortable in that particular situation and things needed to be de escalated. Sometimes I feel with BPD, when we’re triggered it’s like a rat with his back to the wall and panic mode takes over you go for the throat. Which can often be not a true reflection of your actual feelings. I broke up with my wife after 4 years together and 5 months of marriage because she couldn’t take those aspects of me anymore. Try take some time to regain focus if you’re in that situation and don’t push people away with unnecessary things like I did."
