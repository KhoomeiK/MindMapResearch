The weirdness factor doesn’t bother me, because it gets rid of the internal fight to eat 10 chocolate bars, and that’s good enough for me. 

Other thoughts, I just completed 2 weeks Paleo with zero carbs and zero sugar of any kind. No fruit, nothing. I have never managed to be so free of any sugar. It was utterly painless too, so I’m just continuing now. I know it doesn’t work for everyone like it did for me this past two weeks,  but my personal experience is that allowing a little sugar here and there just makes the whole process so much harder and I am so tired of trying to resist the urge to eat 100g of chocolate in one sitting, and still feel like I could eat more. So this time I quit absolutely everything in one go, and it has worked much better and hurt less."

I usually try and keep tripe meals going throughout. I mix the kibble in over about a week as meaty supplies dwindle.

So you are posting in a Codependency sub, but it’s not 100% clear from what you describe, that you are codependent because it could be a number of things going on. It sounds like you have attachment issues, have you heard of this concept? Of having secure / insecure attachments in relationships? It sounds from what you say, like that could be a good thing to find out more about. 

It sounds like you are reaching out to explore how to change your path which is brave and positive. Just keep going, keep reading around your why, have a good look on YouTube there are so many brilliant therapist channels on there. Try Dr Nicole Perrera on Instagram too. 

I am part of a 12 step recovery group. During COVID I have done them online for the first time and it has been much easier for me to do them this way rather than IRL. Maybe try an online CODA meeting and explore whether it resonates.

RelationshipsOver35,fmd94p4,t1_fmbzys8,1585962140.0,"I relate to this answer. Just start manifesting that emotional disconnect outwardly. Don’t share much. Be a bit less available to listen to her. You can still be affable and cordial, just give less of a shit and keep it superficial. Don’t bother asking how she is etc. Fading works gradually over time. I’ve done this in work settings before when things have changed. It’s a manageable, low drama way of doing it. 

Mainly, don’t actually care underneath. It sounds like you DO feel guilty that things have changed. Well, don’t. Let it go, leave it behind. Some friendships are for a season. Your lives no longer resonate. You can still be glad of that time when you were able to support each other, you can still be kind, without being obligated to remain in that dynamic. 

Be straight. Encourage her to get her shit together. Say you’re not interested in hearing her moan, you’re interested in seeing her get out of her crappy situation. Don’t try and be who she needed you to be before. I’m saying this as an expert people pleaser, but hey.

Finally, I had a moany colleague who would stand over my desk mithering on and wasting my time for literally as long as I would put up with it. I was in an Ops role back then and did not have time for his crap. After a couple of weeks of working with him I saw this was going to be a thing, so I just told him straight: “you talk too much, and you stop me working. Get out of my office.” He was a bit taken aback but tbh it became a standard line between us and he got comfortable with just being told to be quiet because there was absolutely no malice on my part. Can I politely suggest a similar tack with your soon to be ex-friend? You don’t have to be her in work counselling service any more. It’s OK to say so."

1) is it a sane growth metric based on your ad budget? I’m guessing you won’t be dropping more than £400 a month at the absolute max??

2) have you got student employees who can be tasked to create you a large scale pod effect?  I’ve seen a local cafe get from 0 to 2.5k in a couple of months using their young trendy staff to drive it. 

3) I second the suggestion of competitions and giveaways with other local businesses. You need to get the engagement up on your page. What about # based competitions to drive UGC?

4) do you have a local BID team you can call on your help you with engagement from other local businesses? 

5) tone of voice. Can you do anything to ramp up the Instaloveableness of the brand? Make it super distinctive? I love @iwillkillagain @biscuiteersltd and for memetastic bar content @tonightjosephine

6) consistent daily engagement. Still works for me, but not at the rate you’re looking for I admit.

7) have you already said yes to this or can you renegotiate that target?? At the end of the day, it’s not about the follower count. It’s about brand awareness for the business with people who will turn into actual customers. You’d be so much better off committing to an ad spend plan where you promise to hit certain quality benchmarks on CPC and CPM, because then you are getting in front of measurable amounts of relevant people. Unless this business has a mail order arm or something that you want a wider audience for?

You might be able to detach with love inside yourself, but actually letting yourself experience and release all your buried rage, injustice and pain is part of your healing journey, so I’d suggest stopping holding on that goal. It’s not important at this point. What’s important is getting out.  

You don’t get to have the happy, controlled, mutually agreeable ending that your codependency wants. 

This is going to hurt, and then you are going to get on with the rest of your life.

Unhook yourself from this drug, and leave it behind.

You did not cause your person’s BPD. You cannot fix their BPD. They will have BPD when you are no longer in their life. You are not “confirming they get abandoned” because you are callous. This is happening because BPD is expert at eating relationships. At destroying every single good thing in it, to push you away, lock you out, redefine you and keep you at a distance. Inside that person, you ALREADY abandoned them because they let go of any sight of who you actually are. They can’t hear you. They can’t see you. They can’t let themselves love you, they can’t receive your love. They are fundamentally broken and their way out is not a codependent. It is consistent therapy and DBT of their own choosing, driven by them, not by another person cajoling.

Your codependency tells you that you can be The One Who Changes Everything. Who opens them up to love and healing. Who helps them walk into a life of acceptance and peace. Who, just by sheer force of will of sticking through their shit, gets them to the finish line.

This is a lie. It’s a morass of lies, about the idea you can control things and make it all better just because you choose it to be.  It’s a lie that amounts to self harm. You are setting yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. 

You deserve love, not punishment. Take all the love you are pouring into this person, and pour it into yourself. Prioritise you. Take yourself on dates. Start journaling. Walk every day. Choose to start your recovery journey.

I was really, really lucky. My BPD partner discarded me and didn’t come back. It was the most horrific thing in a decade of many horrible events contending for that title. I struggle all the time with my codependency recovery. I feel I’m “not very good at it”. But I am so, so glad the pwBPD left, because I would not have. So in everything that I am saying to you, I have the benefit of hindsight and months of no contact. I totally, totally adored my person and was willing to overlook, rationalise, and desensitise so many awful things. The fact that I put up with all of this is what led me to understand just how sick I was with my codependency. The fact I would say these things are OK? There is something deeply wrong that needs healing. 

Good luck to you in your efforts to break free. Giving yourself permission to just detach, no matter how messy, untidy, acrimonious that is, that’s a good place to start. There’s no way to avoid this hurting, because you have enmeshed yourself with your pwBPD and you need to go through breaking the mesh. Sending you love and courage."
Codependency,fk04hqk,t3_ffpcxi,1583741385.0,My sister is codependent as well as me and the romanticised independence thing is a huge deal for her. Maybe taking steps to challenge that outlook is a place to start building openness and vulnerability?
InstagramMarketing,fjuh41u,t1_fjtx484,1583616680.0,That’s really helpful. I will have a try at targeting specific tags that are smaller and relevant to see how we fare with that.
socialmedia,fjr1aew,t1_fjr0s24,1583580226.0,"Shame. I thought they might signpost you to where you can get help. I get quite a bit of variation in the quality of help through their support, some people are great and others not! I’d try again, ask them where you need to go to get the problem sorted. I mean, they can’t advertise to you and make money off you if you’re not on there 🤣. The Messenger chat is still FB business so probably a similar issue."

RelationshipsOver35,fjqwhi6,t3_feq4ph,1583578670.0,"So, I find that reaction in bed a little weird.  It could be he’s got some underlying paranoia that you spy on him, from that original incident. But if you have been together years surely there has been time to rebuild trust with you?

I went out with someone who started something else whilst we were together. He went from being very relaxed about his phone, leaving it lying around and such, to being super twitchy about it. He kept it close by. If he showed me a meme or something, his anxiety to get it back in his hands quickly was obvious.

I don’t expect my person to read through my messages, I agree that privacy is important. But if they did, I have nothing to hide. I’d want to deal with their mistrust by talking about it and finding ways to reassure that person that worked for us both. Your guy seems to just be shutting you out entirely. If you are chatting about a text conversation with a person, isn’t it fairly unremarkable to show them the screen so they can read it? 

Earlier in your relationship, he was asking someone else out on a date, seemingly? Have you ever addressed that problem? Has he ever given you clear assurance there’s nothing untoward? There should be transparency about that. It sounds like he managed to manoeuvre you into not asking too many questions so he could carry on as he pleased?"
RelationshipsOver35,fjqu87k,t1_fjqrxqi,1583577892.0,Yes.

Obviously when I tag I use a variety of sizes anyway. 

Is the overall account reach taken into consideration, or just that post?"

Codependency,fjqsifw,t3_fej54r,1583577337.0,"One of the things I loved about #metoo was that it highlighted how we ARE taught this is normal and we are expected to accept it. Societally it is normal. I am older now and all my negative experiences happened before the age of 30 but when I was younger I needed #metoo to help me identify - there is a reason I am feeling uncomfortable about this, because it’s assault and I am not an object to be picked up and handled. 

When I go out alone as a woman in my 40’s it surprises me how, now that I am not wearing a wedding ring, men will try and connect with me or assess my level of interest by touching my body. Not necessary, keep your hands off me. I literally just met you.

So - yes, I have been unlearning the social programming too."
Codependency,fjor097,t1_fjof7q1,1583533140.0,"Oh I could have written this. I regularly say to myself, what are you even missing?

datingoverthirty,fjjne84,t3_fdmwb1,1583404781.0,"There’s loads of useful things to think about here but I just wanted to add a few small things.

You mentioned your history with unavailable men and attachment issues. Can I recommend Mr Unavailable and the Fallback Girl by Natalie Lue (of Baggage Reclaim).  This was one of the most useful books I read in addressing my own issues.

I understand that feeling of wanting the chemistry and the friendship. I just wanted to say that I think to feel that electricity right at the start with someone is both very rare and also is NOT a guarantee they’re a good fit.  It’s not necessarily a thing to hold out for.  Twice now I’ve had relationships with very disturbed guys who seemed like they were heaven sent 100% at the outset. It all went so horribly wrong after a few months. With my husband of 24 years, there was plenty of spark, but that came several months into a friendship, so we started dating.

Finally, what I’m currently addressing in myself: the best relationship advice seems to me to often focus on telling us to “get yourself into your best life”. You have a list of what you need the other person to be. Are you honouring your future partner by making sure you are bringing your best self into a relationship?"

AlAnon,fj7rr0g,t1_fj6wx2p,1583096853.0,"Sorry for unhelpful acronyms - my bad. 

pwBPD = person with Borderline Personality Disorder. I have 3 family members with this disorder. My sibling and I who are not BPD became monster codependents instead. I also have friends / more than friends who have it; familiarity is comfortable. It’s a truly horrible cluster B personality disorder. These people in my life have always had the disorder, and some are treated and others not.

Coda- the coda is for you. You said some things directly that suggest you might be, and the fact you’re willing to take up a relationship with the red flags waving might affirm that possibility quite strongly. CODA meetings are more geographically scattered than AA but it’s worth trying to get in an actual room with others. It’s definitely NOT just about control. There are patterns of denial, compliance, low self esteem and more, within codependence. It has taken me a long time to understand the depths and pervasiveness of it in my life."
