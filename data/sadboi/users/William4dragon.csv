I found that looking up the symptoms to worry about helped. Since I wasn't experiencing them. Though that can backfire.

AskReddit,fmeq0xr,t1_fme4gca,1586010883.0,"It depends on how long Trump, the rich, and corporations want it to last. They may adjust it based on infection rates, data, and the advice of experts. Though, it mostly comes down to a risk analysis. Is the loss of revenue worse than the cost of life?

It also depends on the American people. How long can millions of people be out of work? Basically, the economy will be the final decision.

It will most likely last until the end of next month. With the possibility of it being extended for another two months. I don't think it will last longer than that. Though, that depends on what the numbers look like in the next two months.

It also depends on what, if any treatments come about in the next few months. The scientific community is focused on this virus. So, an effective treatment could be found in three months, or take till the end of the summer.

Ultimately, I think the lockdown will last three months in the US. But I think precautions will last until herd immunity is reached or a vaccine is found. Though, I could be quite wrong. There are a lot of variables that could change that.

New info could come out about the virus. It could mutate and become more deadly. It's definitely not going away. I hope we find an effective vaccine/treatment soon.
