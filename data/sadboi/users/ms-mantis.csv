hinduism,ep4q137,t1_ep21mma,1559044008.0,I‚Äôve wanted to die many times in life but had to force my brain to do something different.

hinduism,ep0sld8,t1_ep0luoj,1558979835.0,"That‚Äôs how the discussion of the Gita between Krishna and Arjuna starts to begin with. 

Arjuna doesn‚Äôt want to fight and Krishna tells him not to not back out of his duty/have courage. He states that the battle has already been won, the enemy is already slain by him (Krishna) but that he must carry it out now."
hinduism,eoyajda,t1_eoy5187,1558937145.0,"Well, actually Krishna does say this...he talks a lot like Jesus in the Gita, including his place in the universe and tells Arjuna that the killing is already done by him (God), but that he just needs to carry out the act by going out and fighting...so it kinda disputes free will too...

Whether you believe in this if you are a Hindu is different, but I was just reading the Gita tonight."
Buddhism,eo79zxz,t1_eo5svsj,1558334851.0,"I think it‚Äôs more along the lines of ‚Äòwhen you search for something you have an idea in your head of what your searching for, which may not be real‚Äô. 

If you look up the 10 Ox herding pics/poem which is a metaphor to the path of enlightenment, the ox herder is searching to tame the bull (Buddha nature), which he thinks is distinct from himself. At the end you see that he is the bull AND the ox herder both at the same time and is no longer searching/reached enlightenment."
