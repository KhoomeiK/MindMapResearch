You can't talk to anyone without telling her who they are, what you're talking about, etc. You're going to have to deal with her insecurities and suspicions of things you do moving forward. Finding out something happened 3 years ago is almost more hurtful because they know you lied so many times repeatedly to their face. It's not that it definitely won't work, it's just going to be draining and you have to be ready for that and be patient with her as she struggles through it. She will also probably hold this over your head for a long time, especially since you said she tends to say hurtful things when angry. Don't ever lie to a partner again."

We ended up back together, but there was a lot of accompanying lying going on at first. He was sober but still lost in self-serving behavior. We ended up getting married and he recently relapsed again, but has since reengaged with AA. It has been stressful at times, but overall I am glad that we're together.
