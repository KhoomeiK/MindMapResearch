Learned the language, had an accent, had a funny name, and from the beginning I understood that when I come into a classroom, I‚Äôd rather sit where it‚Äôs darker because it‚Äôs friendlier. I think common experience and culture was more important in my case. Also status, money, ... it stayed like that in university, if there was teamwork I would quickly ask an African girl because I knew we would do a good job and both be eloquent in French writing, and serious. 

Recently I was at a store and this white blond 50yr old lady approached me so I can figure what fabric the thingy was made of, I was just a shopper too. Her attitude was super laid back, and she was so friendly, and she had this accent I knew but couldn‚Äôt figure so I asked. Haitian she said. It hit me.  Of course.... but her appearance didn‚Äôt fit the attitude and she looked like a cold arrogant person.  Again, culture. Education, attitude. Perceptions. 

Now it‚Äôs 2019 and there‚Äôs so much talking about race, people putting all whites and all blacks together. Honestly I hate it. I am white but there‚Äôs all sort of whites and all sort of blacks that all come from different places. Backgrounds too. Each have a different history. 

I love bed in the UK for a year and someone told me ‚Äú you‚Äôre ok but the others like you that come here, won‚Äôt tell you what I think‚Äù. This guy never left his town in his life. 

And I think the real fight is getting humanity together for a decent living. The millionaire black or white will never relate to poor people, it‚Äôs not about colour it‚Äôs about social status and culture.

schizophrenia,etb6mf4,t3_c956vi,1562638360.0,"Lookup ‚Äúlactuca virosa ‚Äú for hangovers and anxiety and pain. Also called wild lettuce or opium lettuce. It looks like a weed, and grows here and there. Three kind of plants look exactly the same but differ in seed colour. Lots of YouTube videos on it too and you can order it cheap or find it if it grows where you are. 
Hope you enjoyed being drunk. 
You can message me bad jokes or fucked up shit when you don‚Äôt know where to put it down. Or if you need songs.  Don‚Äôt do the don‚Äôt wanna hurt ppl r√©thorique, you know it‚Äôs not a binding slumber party pillow fight."

schizophrenia,et801po,t3_c956vi,1562542762.0,"Well, look. You‚Äôre in my thoughts. I feel bitter and upset about how this turned out for you. 50%of schizophrenics commit suicide. I‚Äôd  prefer  if you wouldn‚Äôt become a statistic.  Even if it meant being kidnapped by aliens and believing that for the rest of your life. 
I really found your drawing from a while ago impressive. Could relate to a few details too. I really hope you make some more art. 
Can‚Äôt see what else to suggest but here‚Äôs a song. The lyrics are beautiful

schizophrenia,et3nk8w,t1_et391yx,1562436245.0,"Yeah,  not sure about what is good means, but I try to leave a positive mark behind me, but still can‚Äôt be too much around people. An hour at a time or I get agitated and need loneliness. That being said, it‚Äôs easy to give advice from miles away. I looked at your history and you weren‚Äôt always like that. It‚Äôs the prescriptions that fucked you up and sucked you dry. Even the time where you were seeing it all it wasn‚Äôt as bad. Must be something with your dopamine level. They made an addict out of you.  What I believe/ed sounds pretty similar but took a different path. Could‚Äôve ended where you are. 
Some People on this group seem to be helped with some meds, I preferred to go along with my delusional quest. There‚Äôs times I feel shit for a few days/weeks but have a maniac episode to look forward to. 
You‚Äôre in Sweden right? Dunno, I was thinking about non alcohol or drug stuff that helps with wanting to die, and had this spontaneous idea that being kidnapped and dumped in a boat at large in the Baltic with water and oatmeal  for three days.  They would paint your face like a skeleton and other boats would fear you. You would become a legend. Boats would sink. That would be so Viking.  

When I was 25 I thought I could solve all the problems, now the best I can do is this written image."
