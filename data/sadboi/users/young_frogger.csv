A friend explained to me how Manny went up more weight divisions, has a slightly better resumé of names, got more finished, one more meaningful fights in his later years. 

So while Floyd might be the best boxer, Manny had the greater career.

To further this point, MJ would absolutely steamroll teams from the 60’s and 70’s. He would probably average 80. The game has evolved.

nba,fpciwyi,t1_fpc8446,1588502234.0,"Nobody really talks about Pippen being arguably the second best wing in the league at the time. How about the fact that the 90’s had very few competent perimeter scorers to possibly team up with, let alone compete with on a nightly basis like Lebron has had to do.

Jordan never had to go up against anyone of Kobe, Wade, Durant, Curry, Harden, Kawhi or even Lillard, Paul George, Butler, Giannis, and Kyrie’s Caliber. Hell, guys like Ray Allen, Vince Carter, T-Mac, Paul Pierce, Bradley Beal, Luka, would have probably qualified for second best wing and several of them second best player in the league behind Jordan. 

The level of competition Jordan faced at his position was a joke. That’s no knock on him, and I understand his greatness inspired a lot of great guards and forwards after him. But who was he being guarded by? 6’2 John Starks? Dan Majerle? Are we going to pretend Harden and Lebron wouldn’t absolutely smoke those guys into oblivion - particularly with illegal defence rules?

What competition did MJ actually face in the 90’s at his position. Drexler? Richmond? Reggie Miller? Gary Payton? Give me a break man. Sorry Lebron needed a decent teammate in Kyrie to help him beat a 73-win mega team. Sorry MJ never made it out of the first round without Pippen. 

I really have nothing against MJ but the amount of dick riding he receives is sickening. He might be the greatest of all time, but he’s not the best basketball player of all time. There’s a difference. And the truth is it is pretty much impossible for someone who’s prime was around 30 years ago to be the best ever considering just how much the sport has evolved. 30 years is a long ass time for a sport and the human race in general to evolve."

Once again the narrative is “he” went on to 3 peat. Now that Bulls team who won more than 50 games without him is “mediocre” according to one poster. And I guess Lebron has never carried mediocre or when trash teams to extreme heights. 

Should we talk about how the league as a whole is way more athletic, deep and developed skill-wise compared to the 90’s? Nah we can’t let’s just talk about how the 90’s were so physical and guys like Lebron and Harden wouldn’t be able to withstand the immense physicality and hand checking."

He’s also a perfectly competent passer himself. Draymond has been badly exposed this year without talent surrounding him. You cannot tell me a generational offensive talent has worse basketball IQ than a mediocre-at-best offensive player. 

And finally, as many have pointed out already, the defence was in fact set and this was not a transition situation.

She shouldn’t be at the front of any animal rights movements.

All I know is the documentary has brought more awareness to animal cruelty than few other documentaries in history. They showed plenty of footage and discussed the various atrocities committed by all parties. Several people in this thread said they were barely able or completely unable to watch because they found the AC footage so upsetting. So what exactly is the point of this thread? Is everyone upset that there are a few morons out there that like Joe Exotic? And that’s the documentary’s fault why? Because the documentary sure as hell painted him to be the villain.

Like Pop, CP3 definitely has a nice side as he is boys with the banana boat crew, who definitely wouldn’t vibe with him if he was purely an asshole. At the same time he has clearly rubbed some teammates and coaches the wrong way. But maybe his competitive ego would be kept in check a little once he’s no longer playing.

MMA,fkxdi8q,t1_fkucv9q,1584625683.0,"They gave Luke Rockhold zero knees and elbows even though he's a very strong clinch fighter in real life. Truly baffling stuff. AFAIK, only Jones, Anderson, Tony and Israel have the full arsenal of knees and elbows. Jon you can actually alternate between flying knees and knees to the body by holding r1 which is nice, but I just don't get why you can't do this with more fighters. I really don't understand why more fighters don't just have the full repertoire because a lot of fighters, well, do have the full repertoire.  

&#x200B;

There's all kinds of weird decisions in regards to strike choices. Conor doesn't have frontkicks even though he uses them all the time, instead he does that weird knee leg kick thing which I've barely ever seen him throw. They also gave him flying knees but no knees to the body even though Conor throws knees in the clinch way more often than flying knees. I don't even remember the last time I've seen him throw a flying knee. Nate Diaz on the other hand, has a front kick but no knees even though he throws knees way more often than he throws front kicks.

They also gave DC a flying headkick just because he failed it terribly and became a meme one time against Josh Barnett. I mean really?"
SpidermanPS4,fkqdmds,t3_fjw9p3,1584441736.0,"Lol I was 100% Peter was dead because of Into the Spiderverse and the way they had him lying there forever with his eyes wide open.

I spent that entire mission tripping like how are they gonna make this work story-wise having me play as Miles the rest of the way and also grieving Pete. Like damn this is heavier than Last of Us.

That being said, I am scared they will kill Peter for the sequel. I would prefer if they just allowed us to play as two Spider-Men with different gadgets and abilities to give the missions, and the open universe as a whole, a little more flavour and variety."

MMA,fjx0cpa,t1_fjwzogf,1583651190.0,"Exactly..people forget Anderson had fights like this too. This might hurt his stock with the fans a little bit but it's not worth brain damage. And who am I to sit on my couch and call Israel a pussy when he's fighting a savage like Yoel?

That being said, it was a little bit over the top. I would've been happy if both men just engaged a little bit more. Didn't have to be a total banger but this was a little over the top, even for someone who really sympathises with defensive fighters."

Not saying AJ can’t knockout Wilder, but it’s not this sure thing you’re making it out to be."
