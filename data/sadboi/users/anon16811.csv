Meditation,f3mx14x,t1_f3mobp4,1570992873.0,">Another thing I can tell you is try too enter into ""atemporality"", or how you wish to call it (infinite, no time dimension etc.). It will help you realize there is no you, and that you are here to make clear the fact everythingnis your creation and you have to learn and grow. They tell you bunch of this stuff, the real thing is experience by yourself, don't get caught in rational understanding of universe. Peace.

amen!"
