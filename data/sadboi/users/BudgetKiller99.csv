depression,fr3da9j,t3_gm1bew,1589854937.0,"Hi, i just read your post and it's really heartbreaking man im so sorry this happened to you. It blows my mind how there are people out there that can do something like that. I just dont get it. Like unless youre in an abusive relationship, then there is no good reason to cheat. If u want someone else you break up with your partner and that's that. Also covid situation makes it a lot lot worse. 

So i started a relationship with my friend who told me she was single not long before quarantine started, so for the most part of the last 2 months we haven't been able to see each other (besides video calls obviously). But we talked to each other all day everyday, literally 20 hours a day eithe texting or calling. I was sleeping from 2-3am to 6am and had work at 6:30am most days. We dm'd all the time even when i was working id reply on my smartwatch. Like it was constant. We did everything you can do without meeting ie sexting sending nudes even went on dates in games like just as a bit of fun. Despite only being 2 months i fell madly in love with her (didnt help i was stuck in my room and only talked to her) She made that happen and also corona and stuff has made it feel more like 6 months imo. Anyway last week on her bday her bf messaged me on ig. I threw up several times coz my stomach just sank. U probably know that feeling. I was this girls affair, and i just dont understand why she had to do it, like why me i did nothing to her (her bf did but thats beside the point). Im quarantined literally to my bed room as im the only one leaving the house. So i have no escape from my thoughts. And as u were saying i just wish i could forget about it, i wish i could have my memory wiped. Everyone tells me to forget about it. But in the current situation its not possible. I play games i listen to music but they just piss me off because im thinking about this constantly, nothing is distracting me. My family talk to me but im zoned out i feel like im not even there. I am in body but my soul has yeeted the fuck outta here. 

I honestly can't imagine the pain youre going through, i have some idea, but imagine its multiple times worse. When i first found out i just wanted to fucking kill her, then he was blaming me, like bruh i didnt know u existed, so then i wanted to kill him for existing. And then the next few days i wanted to just kill myself so the pain would stop and i wouldnt have to even think about it ever again because its just fucked up, and i can't get my head around it even now. I think i was in shock. Like its pretty fucked up to think it's okay to cheat on someone. As someone who doesnt think its okay in the slightest i just cant comprehend why someone would do it. 

As i said though covid is gonna make this a lot harder for you as it already is. Believe me you are one strong guy to get through it in these times. I don't know if any of this is somewhat relatable to your situation in terms of the feelings and such. But you're a trooper and u will get through this. Its gonna hurt like a muther fucker, u just gotta be strong enough to wait it out, wait for lockdown to end then u can find stuff to distract yourself and will then be able to start moving on. Good luck friend, and sorry this happened to u."
socialskills,fr1vkhl,t1_fr1txzj,1589826672.0,"Nooo im not from a well off family, very much working class. And they're not using me when i give people stuff at work its occasional, theyre usually surprised idk i just like givin them stuff haha. And i dont pick up the group tab either. Its just i have friends who will buy each other drinks and stuff all night and some will spend more one night and others the next. Theres just some people that wont really buy any i guess. But i think nothing of it. I dont by them a drink in the hopes they buy me one.

And i did plan to pay him back, like an hour later, of my own accord. Its just it tics me off when people ask for money i owe them like that. Like just give me a fuckin chance to sort it out you get me? So if it was me who paid for the trip, if I was in his position. I would have told my friend at the time how much it was, he would have gone home and i would not once ask him for the money. Id wait for him to ask how much it was or ask what my bank details were. Because hes a friend and i trust hes going to pay me it back when he can. Which is fine. I feel like asking for money is somewhat aggressive and makes it seem like you dont trust that they would pay it back of their own accord. Basically questioning your trust and principles i guess. Idk it just bugs me"
socialskills,fqz1r0z,t3_gld21j,1589758359.0,"Im a 21 year old guy and im in the same boat lol. This is something i too think about. I somehow have just not met people i feel i have a connection with either. There's been girls ive been into, only a couple ive made it obvious i like them and 1 i asked out but nonetheless they didnt like me, and i could tell with most of them. I did go for a maccas breakfast with one of the girls i liked at work this last valentine's day. But it was just coincidence it was valentine's day, there was nothing to it we were just hanging out lol. But more recently i asked a friend out who said she was single, and she said yes, just before lockdown started, so we were texting and calling and stuff for 2 months all day everyday, i mean like 20 hours a day i kid you not. She started sexting and sending nudes and stuff and ofcourse i reciprocated. It became a regular thing. Anywho she made me fall for her hard, making out she loves me, and we never even got to go on a date coz last week on her birthday her fuckin bf messages me on instagram, lol fml. I dont understand why someone would do that. She said she was afraid id stop talking to her if she said no. But i wouldnt have, i was just trying my luck because we get on really well. Anywho, that was 2 months wasted and i threw up a lot when i found out. And what i realised is i dont care about being a virgin, and i definitely want to wait for someone i have a connection with like i thought i did with this girl (but hopefully for real next time). And i know what it feels like when youre in love too. Though quite honestly she played a blinder i think she deserves an oscar ngl.

Shit, my replies always end up longer than op, my bad. Its kind of weird yeah, but youre still young. I guess the older u get the weirder it gets. I feel like ive missed out but i just havent met anyone who i like just as much as they like me. I dont know how everyone else does it quite frankly. I do wonder if theres something wrong with me lol, obviously its hard for me to tell coz im just me innit and we all know mums be biased af. So to conclude id say you dont need to worry about it just yet. Its a lil out of the ordinary perhaps. Ask the question in 4 more years and id say its quite weird and i hope its not me asking it in 4 years haha. Good luck and stuff"

depression,fqqoytd,t3_gibavz,1589569355.0,"University was hell on earth for me. In second year i barely turned up id say my attendance was like 20%. I almost got kicked off after having a breakdown in early december 2017 and failed the module coz i didnt show up. Because my previous gtades were so good i was let off the hook. But it didnt make me any better. Basically what got me through that second year was the fear of getting kicked off the course and failing. Third year was a nightmare too. I did not work or reading until max 2 days before assignment was due. We had assignments due every other friday. And between that time id go to lectures some days but id be half asleep. But thankfully the odd thing they told me stuck in my mind. I did nooo reading either between assignments. I did law so reading is very very important. But i did none. I always tried to start my assignments early. But i never got as far as a title until the last 48 hours. Like my cognitive dysfunction/brain fog just wouldnt allow me to focus on anything i was trying to read or think about. My brain would be distracted by hundreds of other thoughts in my mind and by every stimulus, noises, smells, lights or literally anything became more interesting than focusing on the work. But as the hours go by i start to realise how fucked i am if i dont seriously start right now. And i think it was a bit of the fight or flight response. Id just have these adrenaline/anxiety and red bull fuelled 48 hours of doing all the reading i needed and banging out an assignment. They were pretty shit imo. I didnt try. I got a 2:1 Uni Law degree so I can't complain"

Im twice the guy he is (and im really not blowing my own trumpet) i treated her like my princess. The other guy was giving her no attention. Theyd been together 8 months and only met once, how does that even fucking make sense? She cheated which is a shitty thing to do but it sounds like he gave her many fucking reasons to want to. Its just a mssive mind fuck. It just doesn't make any sense. But yeah fuck that bitch. I lost 3 months to her bs. It hurts real fucking bad. Thanks for the response dude, i appreciate it."

relationship_advice,fq1t86l,t1_fq1mpa4,1589048965.0,"Yeah i think it's a good way to be. I kinda have to as well lol, otherwise its very easy to be paranoid about everything which gets you no where. My friend recently broke up with his girlfriend coz he asked her if she was sleeping with other guys to many times when she wasnt. He was just paranoid for no reason. I guess thats what quarantine did to him idk.

But yes you're right she only has the chance if i give her the opportunity. But maybe id do a good job of not giving her a reason too aswell haha. But also its not in my control rn coz i dont even know if she wants me lol. I think shes taking some time to self reflect atm so maybe i'll leave her to it for a while. Or maybe i should just find out if she wants me or not. Get it over and done with. Obviously if she doesn't even want me theres little i can do but gradually remove her from my life completely.

And i know what i should do. I know the logical thing. But love =/= logic lol, we'll see"
relationship_advice,fq1e9j6,t1_fq19u77,1589044864.0,"Yeah, i get you, i am being naive. And of course im biased towards her lol coz im a dumb ass that still loves her. However i did also talk to her bf and he said some pretty awful stuff about her which werent even true and that was the tip of the iceburg for her. I guess it gave me some indication of his character first hand, idk he was also mad so understandable perhaps. But then again i was very mad and i said nothing bad about her so. Anyway, pretty much my plan is to carry on until the end of quarantine and phase it out. Ie just talkin to her less and less and doing stuff in the real world. I cant just go cold turkey now. Like shes part of my quarantine routine/lifestyle. I know its cringe, but im in to deep. I think going cold turkey would be a lot worse for me with my depression and stuff, because id feel that loss, that hole immediately. And id get really lonely. And probably suicidal. I cant deal with being left with my own thoughts too long. Like i said i know its cringe to read but it's fact, that's just me lol"
relationship_advice,fq17xdc,t1_fq14j65,1589042992.0,"I mean maybe thats true. And i cant disagree with you on that one. Lol thats kinda brutal but you may be right, it think i will keeps things as they are for know until quarantine is over and i can actually move on (ie we still talk all the time but with out the sexting and nudes and lovey dovey shit.) Ive never cheated so i dont know what makes people cheat from personal experience. I know some terrible things happened to her until last year. And he uses that against her saying he was there for her when such and such happened as if that gives him the right to treat her badly, i think thats partly why shes steyed. It clearly isnt as simple as it seems  And i know what happened with her bf as they both told me the same events seperately when they were shitting on each other ie when they had no reason to stick to a story and lie to me. I havent decided what im gonna do yet. The comments are pretty overwhelmingly against her which i expected. I just needed some outisde perspective. I know i try and stick up for her in my responses too, i guess thats just me trying to see the best in her and give her the benefit of the doubt"
relationship_advice,fq13tpk,t1_fq0ztcm,1589041367.0,"Lol thanks i guess, and yeah i knooo it hurts me real bad what she did. I know she feels bad and is sorry, shes just a dumbass and got carried away with me because i was doing what her bf should have been doing. But yeah its only her fault. She had a choice. Thing is im too trusting and i have faith in people. I always say i should only worry about what i can control, ie the way i behave and the decisions i make, the person i choose to be. You can worry about and try and control everything around you but it will drain you. And so i cant worry whether she cheats on me or not its out of my control. Thats upto her. Obviously i can have influence. But ultimately its upto her.

I mean i do blame myself for being too trusting, lol but its just me, id rather trust and be deceived than never to trust anyone."
relationship_advice,fq11iua,t1_fq0xai1,1589040500.0,"Im not saying it is. Shes also bipolar though, like pretty bad. Im not saying its an excuse but its perhaps some kind of a reason for her actions. When shes having an episode she needs more attention and affection, so a guy who ignores her calls and texts for days sometimes is not the right person. She has issues for sure, i grew up with a pretty badly disabled younger brother who'd assault me often and hed hate me half the time and love me the other half. And my emotions ended up mimicking his. I really fucking hated him half the time then id love him more than anything the rest the time. Its super confusing for your state of mind. It definitely took its toll on me. But shes no where near to being as bad as that and i think id be genuinely good for her. I know i owe her nothing and stuff and im not saying im gonna try and get back with her either. Im just trying to have a discussion about this, because its not black and white to me what i should do.

relationship_advice,fq0t4re,t1_fq0qvsx,1589037298.0,"Idk, i feel like if a girl cheated on me because i was a bad bf then its somewhat my own fault.

So like if i had done everything to make her happy and she cheated on me but her reason wasnt because i did this or that wrong, ie shes just wasnt that into me thats not my fault and is completely her doing. U see what im saying, i may be way off the mark here but im not very experienced in relationships. But i like to think of the psychology of peoples decisions haha. Also my dick doesnt control my mind, sex doesnt make me any better at yugioh so im not fucking interested..... Jokes. I am interested lol, but i would literally wait until marriage if i have to, its not that important to me. Its more about the way she makes me feel though. Like ive had girls interested in me before but they've never made me feel special. It was always just like... meh. So idk if she just ended up in this shitty situation from her being a dumbass. She also said she hasr tried to end it with this guy but he kept persuading her not too. I think she maybe felt a lil more loyal to him coz he was official and hes been to her house and stuff.

I eat the bottom chocolate off, again with the first layer of biscuit on the bottom for cleaner seperation. Then i eat it layer by layer from there.

Cant go in the rest of the house or see my family because im the only one leaving the house to go to work and my dad doesnt want Corona for obvious reasons.

We talked constantly everyday, from saying goodmorning or hey when we woke up to saying goodnight. I found this out on Saturday, which was her birthday. I woke up at 4:50 am to say hb to her at 5am which is midnight for her, we called later in the day after i finished work at about 3pm for an hour or 2. She went for a nap at 6pm (my time) and her real bf messaged me at 9pm and told me. She never loved me or wanted me yet told me multiple times a day, off her own back ie not just saying it in response to me. She said sooo much stuff to me that you wouldnt say unless u were genuine. I told her about my depression, she told me shed be with me to get help. I told her how i used to drive to work like 6 months ago and id drive passed this wall every morning at 6am and my brain would tell me to crash into it and id have to make a conscious effort/decision not to. She said when she came over shed be riding in my car and i wouldnt have these bad thoughts because shed be with me. But she had no intentions of coming over or even meeting me. It was just a joke. And there was so many things she made me promise her and i thought she was making sure i was sincere but all along she wasnt sincere about anything. I made her an 18th birthday card but her bf also told me she lied and she actually turned 17. 

She did all this because her boyfriend didnt give her attention ever and was liking lewd pictures of others girls and would tell her his type of girl (ie not her) and basically a bit of a douche by the sounds of it. She said she appreciated me and i made her happy. But she didnt love me or want me. She wanted her bf. She said yes to me when i asked her out and just played along with it. All i thought about all day everyday was her. I dont like much about myself (just no self confidence and stuff) but im loyal af, and caring, and kind and generous with my time and money. It upsets me that she was treated badly and i wanted to treat her like a queen. But i never get a chance because i'm just a joke. This stuff literally always happens to me.

I'm so confused partly because im trying to work out what she was sincere about. There was nothing wrong with how things were before i asked her out, but i didnt know she was lying about her age and not having a bf, that would turn this into an absolute shit show. The other issue i have is i can't be alone, i have to be engaged in social interaction as much as possible because im afraid of my own thoughts. The more time im alone the worse i get. Like this morning i was kinda over it and i kinda hated her, but as the day went on my feeling completely change. Its hard to explain. But now we're talking like were before all this. But then i'll remember something she said to me, like the first time she called me her SO which was very surprising to me and so i was thinking like wow and thought she was sincere. Ffs i dont even know what to think anymore tbh. Im afraid of her not being there in any capacity because i appreciate her conversation and friendship.

I know youre right though, but my brain is just mush and ive lost a sense of reality with quarantine and this girl talking to me constantly"

And online services are closed from corona which makes no sense. I know that's going to happen i just believed this time it was actually real. Pretty much since the age of 13 its been the same story, people lying to me and deceiving me and playing with my feelings. When i was 14-16 i liked a girl in school who told me she loved me and kissed me and stuff often and i loved her. And it was all lies, she was joking and got pregnant with some 30 year old dude. And its been the same story between then and now, just people not being genuine. I will do that stuff, i have a youtube channel and things, which i havent made videos for in a while because ive been distracted, i just need to get back to it.

Yeah it's gonna be tough, there's a big hole in my life to fill, lots of extra time i now have, the fact it was everyday and constant makes it hard to forget about, like even when im at work shes texting me throughout the day. I have my first shift without it in half an hour, it's gonna be very weird. Yeah i stopped messing with people online too after bad experiences on tinder and stuff. I was just friends with this girl at first for a while and then my stupid self decided to go further, partly because i am quarantined to my bedroom as im the only one leaving the house to go to work and my dad has asthma and doesn't want Corona, but also because she told me she was single. Like whyyy it was so pointless to do that. But yeah litearlly a few weeks before this happened i was in the pub with my friends tellin them why i dont fuck with people online. But then i was alone and did just that. I guess my gut instinct was right though, and everybody called it being a troll but i didnt listen, because there was no indication that was the case. She spent so much time talking to me and said so many nice things to me every fucking day i thought there was no way it could be bs. Loool how wrong i was, what a clown."
depression,fpemgnf,t1_fnderhn,1588550393.0,"Omg dude u were right, it was a massive troll of sorts. Basically she was on reddit looking for people to talk to because her boyfriend wasnt giving her attention. And so she talks to me all day, everyday for over a month. Until last night. It was her birthday. I had called her in the day for an hour or so. Then she went for a nap. And her vf messaged me and he was like who the fuck are you im her boyfriend. She had a bf and yet chose to talk to me all the time because he was busy."
depression,fpelgts,t1_fpdx44x,1588549841.0,"She said she didnt love me. She said she started having feelings for me and felt guilty (because she loved her bf but he wasnt giving her attention) I dont know if that was at the start, or a month in or like the last few days though. But yet she has told me she loves me and wants me countless times, but she told me today she didn't. All she had to do was not lie about being single in the first place and i wouldnt have asked her out. Like we were just friends and i was fine with that, but she was cool so i thought there was no reason not to ask her out and it'd be somethin for us to look forward too at the end of quarantine to go on our first proper date. But nooo she had no plans to do that even though she told me constantly every damn day. She listened to me and her responses seemed like someone who genuinely cares but its not much good if youre being massively deceived at the same time. 

And yeah i know depression is a curse, i suffer myself. And i cant expect other people to behave the same way i would. But i still know whats right and wrong and lying to someone for 3 months and playing with there feelings like that isnt right in the slightest.

And yeah i understand that and for the most part im blocking it out but then i remember serious stuff i told her about my mental health or whatever and shed reply as if she really cared and she was gonna be there for me and i just feel sick again. She may have cared and it really seemed that way, yet was happy to feed me bs and false promises. I never show my depression irl, whats it called like high function depression. But as soon as im left to my own devices its very very bad for me."
depression,fpdl6nd,t1_fpcv7kq,1588529165.0,"Dude i was throwing up and had the worst diarrhoea ever last night just from the grief and stress. And yeah im very sure ive been speaking to her all day. She said, she said yes when i asked her out because she didnt want me to stop talking to her (we were friends before) and so she just went with it because her bf wasnt giving her enough attention either and she felt lonely. Her boyfriend last night told me shes not 18 shes 17. I had made her an 18th birthday card too and my friend from school was doing a design on some nike air force 1's i got her. I dunno how she kept up the lies for 3 months, she lied from day 1. It also means i was sending and receiving nudes from a minor which is just fucked up. I didnt realise i actually had to fucking ID my friends. She just let me fall for her so hard because she liked the attention i gave her and the kindness i showed her. She made me reassure her and promise her, that i want her and love her and wouldnt cheat on her and that shes beautiful and all these other things every fuckin day and i thought it was because she was maybe a bit insecure or just worried that i wasnt sincere but i guess it was just to make her feel better about herself knowing guys want her. But all the while she was telling me the same stuff and i trusted what she said, i didnt question it because it was every fucking day. But it was all lies. I just dont understand how you can text/dm someone all day everyday for 2 months telling lies. She kept trying to justify herself and say she only lied twice, about her age and having a boyfriend (you know, not like they're major lies anyway), but she lied to me everyday for 2 months telling me she loved me and wanted me and wanted me in her bed and other things. 

None of it needed to happen. She had a choice, and chose to play me for 2 months. 

I woke up this morning and all im thinking is, is this actually real wtf. Because its just fucked up. Im not even mad and i havent cried or nothing its just an insane overwhelming feeling, like that sinking feeling inyour stomach, but its constant like i just cant comprehend it. Shes explained why (what i said above,) and i dont even hate her now, because the feeling of confusion and what the actual fuck is all that fills my mind, like i just dont get it. I did nothing wrong."
depression,fpcc2eh,t1_fnwnwqv,1588494923.0,"Well it turns out she didnt love me. It was her bday yesterday and her boyfriend messages me on instagram.

Artadvice,fp0akb4,t3_gakvxl,1588205573.0,"So basically I want to do somethin like this for my gf for her birthday. My options are to do it myself or pay someone else to do it. Obviously the benefit of me doing myself is, it is more personal, I guess. It's something i literally made for her. But the disadvantage is i havent really done art in like 6 years. I was the second best graded in my class at school but that was like 6 years ago. Obviously if i was gonna do it, id have to practice a lot. But also it doesnt have to be as good as the picture, and the style will be a little different. The fact i could butcher some kinda expensive shoes is a pretty big disadvantage too. On the other hand i get a seasoned artist, maybe a student who wants some extra money and wants to do some work for there portfolio. And im kind of guaranteed something good. But the disadvantage is that they could fuck still mess it up, but in a way id rather them than me haha. Also its less personal I guess.

So i need advice on whether I should do it or pay someone to do for me. And then if I am to do it myself, where do i fookin begin? And what would I use/need for something like this."

But i dont think its exclusive to her, its just im willing to move somewhere else in general anyway.

You don't sound mean at all, you're just shining a light on the reality, and i respect that. I've been listening to philosophers like alan watts recently. Although i feel they talk a load of bollocks sometimes he does make some good points. 'You haveÂ to take risks. There will be disappointments and failures and disasters as a result of taking these risks. But, in the long run, it will work out. My point is that if you donât take them the results will be so much worse than any kind of wild anarchy that could be conceived'. Thats a quote i just pulled from google but its in his talks. He also says how without taking risk you can predict your future. Meaning if u always do the same thing, and whats 'safe' then you're just going in a circle and the outcome will always be the same. Which is pretty much me the last 4-5 years.

I do appreciate your advice, and take it into consideration, but i guess im still willing to take the risk. And it may turn out you were completely right. But i still want to try, as that's all we can do"

Take it one step at a time. I mean she did joke about me getting a k-1 visa but i think shed been watching to much 90 day fiancee haha. But yeah in the long term it probably isn't feasible being long distance at all.

Like if i gotta ring the bank id rather drive to the nearest branch and talk face to face, its that bad.

Usually if we dont call its because shes sleeping, like it doesnt help with the time difference but her sleep schedule is messed up which makes it worse lol.

But i totally get it like everyones the same to some extent and the more time u spend on your own and just your own opinion and thoughts you start seeing floors in yourself that nobody else sees as floors.

And clearly you're not those things, you just think you are as i think stuff like that about myself. But they are all subjective also, i think its dumb when people say persoanlity is more important than looks. Because beauty is subjective, there is more too it than either personality or looks, its the whole package and also the way you make the other person feel. Anywho...

Ngl i'm not sure i can deal with OCD people because they stress me out lol. I went on a trip to Amsterdam with my m8 and hes ocd, one thing he does is hed put the a/c fan on to sleep even though it was january so it wasnt fuckin warm at all anyway. And the noise was so annoying lol. But i didnt complain i just suck it up because its not the end of the world. So its definitely very cool that you found someone who hasnt an issue with it. I might also not be able to have kids coz i had a mountainbiking accident a few years ago and hit my balls so hard, maybe i should get a sperm count some time.

But seriously though its awesome that you found someone who loves you for you and all your imperfections and what not. It really is an incredible feeling. I wish you the best for your future with her! :D"

Yeah im trying not to think about it, im just keeping her entertained one day at a time atm.

Im tryin to think of somethin. She wont let me send a card coz theyre not collecting post or some shit because of corona, she told me to bring it with me but that could be ages yet. I actually made her a card aswell it took me like 3 hours but she made me show her it and she loved it lol"

We were talking about the fact im a virgin a few weeks back (im 21 btw) and she said she was really suprised (shes known a while jst hadnt talked about it much) and so I asked why. And she said because i'm really fucking attractive. I was kinda suprised at her saying that and just said that no one had said tht to me before which is true.

I am very grateful for having her and will do my best by her. Thanks for replying and for some valuable tips."

Yup, it has. I am kinda concerned that if quarantine goes on too long she might lose interest. But then on the other hand its not like we're out there meeting new people to take our attention. I guess i just have to come up with new ideas of what we can do. I hope so too. I have no doubt i would go there now if it wasnt for quarantine.

And also i live in the UK and she Lives in USA. So it's a bit of an issue lol, but im gonna go over there and see her after quarantine. Im nervous to meet her and kinda worried she wont like me. But then i think about what my post was about and how she likes all the stuff i didnt think much of or didnt like about myself and im not so worried. And i dont think theres anything that could happen that would make me not like her unless shes and fbi agent whos been using a very very good deep fake lol. But i kinda doubt that."
depression,fnuam2n,t3_g3ljni,1587257986.0,"After i finished school and went to uni this was the mindset i had. No one was getting in touch with me from school so why would i contact them. I decided not to initiate conversation with anyone for a week. A week went by and i didnt hear from most people. Just close family occasionally and a couple of people who would sometimes contact me first. A month went by and for the most part still nothing. I deleted my fb, pretty much losing contact with everyone i fuckin knew, i had the mindset of ,'well fuck em, if they dont want to initiate anything with me then i dont with them'. I thought everyone just thought they were too good for me or they have people theyd rather chat to. I realised properly at the start of this year (i finished 3rd year of uni last summer) i had just shot myself in the foot big time. I had nothing else to lose and was depressed af, and decided to reach out to one of my best mates from school. He'd had an awful thing happen in his life at uni that i didnt know about, and after talking to him for a bit i realised he was in exactly the same situation as me. He didnt think people were bothered about staying in touch so he never reached out. Doing this changed my mindset a lot. If i see someone i know or know of in public i will make sure im the one to approach them and engage in conversation. I will initiate conversations on social media with old friends and usually the people are very happy to hear from you. 

Sorry for the long comment, the post just hit me in the feels because its understandable to feel how you do about it, as I did. But i guess you have to remember they are only human and they have feelings too which maybe similar or even worse than yours. Im pretty sure this old friend of mine would not have ever got in touch with me if I hadn't with him. But its not because he didnt care deep down, i guess he just thought, i didnt care enough to get in touch with him so he felt he shouldnt care either and never bothered."

depression,fndiznz,t1_fnderhn,1586871095.0,"It's kinda too late for that and tbh that doesnt worry me either tbh. Like shes sent me stuff too and unless shes using an epic deep fake  then shes real. I just cant 100% know her motives. But i know u cant irl anyway, like its better to trust and be deceived than to never trust thats what the old lecturer dude says, Alan Watts. On my good days i feel great atm but on my bad days the negative thoughts and paranoia come in to play and suddenly everything becomes a problem when it probably isnt. If that makes sense. 

She seemed in a mood last night idk why but i had a dream that she just ghosted me. And when i woke up it kinda scared me at how easy that would be and how it would cripple me. But then i think about all the time we have spent texting and calling each other, and all the things we have talked about and said to each other, and think it surely would not be possible for this to be a troll or for her to be playing me, unless shes a real crazy bitch psychopath. I feel like we've invested too much time and emotion into this for it to be a troll and the only way it could be a troll is with pure evil. 

The internet is a scary fucking place, like theres a reason i stopped using tinder and stuff. Because i prefer meeting and getting to know people irl and then asking them out (not that ive done much of that), but its just simpler and more real. So naturally, i wouldnt want to get in a relationship over the internet and wonder if i should just block her. But theres 2 factors at play stopping me: 1. We are in quarantine, theres no going out and talking to people anway, and theres only so many times you can ask your best friends what they've been upto and they give u the same answer, fuck all; 2. If she is what she seems to be then I do actually like her a lot and would want to date her after quarantine."

The popular game on my channel, lego worlds, has kinda died a death, still has an audience but not a growing one. The game is being developed or updated anymore. Im gonna get the new lego star wars when it comes out and hopefully that will bring some life back to my channel. Atm im making like 1 video of lego worlds every 2 weeks or so and just uploading what i play and want to upload inbetween. Its funny because my other stuff will get less than 100 views in months.

I've also commented on youtubers videos with similar content to me, just to let my presence be known, and also going to these other youtubers streams. So my main competitor for the game i play has like 10k subs now, hes given me shoutouts before which is nice, but i have been to his streams before and commented in them, and often enough I get a shoutout for that. Theres also an app called google rewards which gives you goolge play credit for doing surveys. Now these surveys are 95% of the time 1 or 2 questions and you will get anything from 6p to 50p per survey. They send a notification when they have surveys available. So once ive built up a Â£1 or 2 i will donate it in a stream with one of my competitors. Easy way to get noticed in a stream of like 50 viewers hehe.

This guy had i think 4 parts to his lego titanic movie and 3 got about 750k views and another got 1.4mill. So i really was the right place at the right time and right content.

Entrepreneur,fgj1z7u,t1_fgdua9o,1580835457.0,"Fair enough lad, sounds like that was good for you. Yeah in some ways tech has made things harder, especially now, as markets are crowded and theres a lot of competition. Like it was pretty easy to get big on youtube back in 2010, but now theres so much competition its very hard. Same with apps on phones, like games and stuff, in 2008 there were few people making games, and so anything half decent did very well. Today its a crowded market, theres thousands and thousands of people making apps and games. Its all about timing. Anyone mining bitcoin in 2010, is gonna be a multimillionaire now, but if you do it now you'll make jack shit realistically. I guess thats the nature of technology, its very quickly changing and if you want to do well, timing is important.

I started a little business a few years ago in my first year at uni, buying games (digital keys) in wholesale bundles and selling them individually online. I think i will give it another go but you have to register as a sole trader now, which isnt really a problem tbh as its free, just a bit inconvenient. Also the profit margins are quite small so you rely on quantity. I think i just need to start with spending Â£100 and see what i get back, as a proof of concept, because at the end of the day even if its a flop, losing Â£100 is not a major loss."
space,fggkof2,t1_fggisz7,1580763865.0,"Well thats the thing, i never drop my phone from my hand like Neil Tyson was saying, but theres other factors to consider like it falling out of your pocket, some one knocking it out your hand, if you set it down somewhere slightly unsafe, like on a table but with a bit of the phone off the edge of the table, theres a significantly higher risk of you or someone else accidently knocking it off. You also have to consider what surface its on, ie if i put my phone on the couch/sofa/chair arm at my home. They are not flat, but are somewhat curved, a phone without a case would slide off, but with one of those plastic jelly like cases, it wouldnt slide off. Or your phone might get scratched by something in your pocket like coins or keys (thats how mine get scratched). Not having a case because you say you wont drop your phone is kinda dumb and foolish. I also think cases give you a better grip of your phone anyway. So you might as well have one, 1. Because its easier not to drop as its more grippy, and 2. If your phone drops from a pocket or table or is in any position to get damged (that isnt dropping it from your hand), a phone case reduces the risk of it getting damaged. Like you said you can do everything right, e.g. ive never crashed my car (i do actually wear a seat belt though) and id say the bigger risk for me is someone hitting me imo"
space,fggav7m,t1_fggah8c,1580757972.0,"Yeah and his reason was that he changed the risk from his phone braking if he drops it, to him dropping his phone and said therefore he doesnt drop it. I love how Joe rogan is mind fucked yet pretends to understand it. Btw i dont wear my seat belt when i drive because i changed the risk, the risk changed from me getting hurt if I crash, to me crashing. So I just dont crash! :D"

Entrepreneur,fgdha9z,t1_fgcxze1,1580682436.0,"It does haha, i'm just sick of going to the pub and watching tv and stuff, I want to focus all my time on something worth while, we waste so much time these days on our phones, or playing games (though i have a youtube gaming channel which i get like Â£500 a month from) or watching tv. I believe its possible, with hardwork and the right skills and knowledge. Law isn't for me unfortunately, but thankfully it was a Business Law degree, so I learnt some stuff that may come in handy. I was forced into deciding what I wanted to do when I was 17 and my family made me go to Uni. I wish I had taken time out after A-levels. I had worked since I was 14 and had saved a decent amount of money, so I wish I went travelling or did some volunteer work or something and gone to uni the year after, after I had decided what I wanted to do. But I am where I am, theres no point in dwelling on the past.

I'm good with computers, i've made multiple websites, so thats a possibility. I'm thinking of spending my money on a 3d printer and a furnace, I have some good ideas of what I would make, obviously the chinese can make it cheaper, so they have to be niche items that arent mass produced. I've started learning Chinese recently, I also want to learn to code and animate. Obviously I can only do a few things, you can't do everything at once. It's weird, when I was at school I'd rather do anything than learn, id play games or watch literally anything on youtube, but now at 21, all I want to do is learn. I guess it's just liberating to be able to learn what you want, when you want and how you want."

Now, hypothetically speaking if you knew nothing about trading with leverage or trading in general, how quickly could you possibly learn to do it to a reasonable level. Could you gain the knolwedge and experience to do well at it in one solid month, spending every available minute on it, i know itd be optimistic, but could it be done? Dw if you dont know"
Entrepreneur,fg7tj91,t1_fg7sziv,1580601096.0,"Wow thats really cool dude, Is this something you went to uni or college to study? Or something you learnt for fun? I got a 2:1 law degree this last summer, but I have no skills from that which could help me get 10k in a month lol. Like to become a Solicitor, it would take me another 4 or 5 years of studying and training and even then i wouldnt get 10k a month for a fair few years haha"

But words will never hurt me. They're just fucking words for fuck sake, they can be as offensive to the person hearing them as they want them to be. To me they're just words so why would it hurt? I have polish herritage and some kid at school was calling me a polish cunt and being what people would describe as racist. I didnt fucking care, because its just words, but the kid was a knob so I told the debuty head teacher what he said and she let me choose his punishment ahahahhaha, obviously I chose to have him expelled because im a big mean twat loool. Okay so I'm half joking here, i can see why calling someone swear words or being racist can be offensive, but when swear words are said like describing a situation or an object, ie youre late for work and you you say for fuck sake or fuck my life or something, i dont see the problem. Too much fucking PC snowflake bullshit these days for sure!"
