If you have friends talk to them, see your therapist (don't reveal any immediate plans for suicide or you might as well call the hotline). 

If you are truly worried about killing yourself and are fine with going to a psych ward for a few days of course there's no reason not to call them tho.

I'm just putting this here because I've talked to a lot of people who didn't know what they were getting into when the were just looking for someone to talk to. The fact that (in the US at least) your often stuck with a huge bill afterwards often doesn't help either."

It's a phenomenal book and a lot of its sections + a ton of more content are also available on YouTube as ~5 minute videos that are very entertaining to watch in my opinion.

He also has a recommended list of 12 foods you should eat every day (whole grains, cruciferous vegetables, other vegetables, greens, nuts/seeds, berries, fruit, beans, flaxseeds, herbs and spices...). Great tool for getting a feel whether you're eating healthy.
