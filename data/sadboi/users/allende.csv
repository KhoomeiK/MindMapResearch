* Not ads at all
* Instantly reward creators while you watch
* Creators are rewarded for every second viewed
* Not streaming support yet, but it is on the roadmap (FAQs)
* A ""teaser"" feature also is planned so you can show up a preview of your videos, but majority of the content will remain exclusive/monetized

I'm not a huge fan of paywalls for content, but at least Cinnamon/Coil pay based on actual content being consumed so you basically support all your favorites creators instead of other models like Patreon where you have to support individually to each creator in a monthly basis (an equivalent of 5 creators based on minimum Patreon tier of $1usd) , so let's see how this evolve.

CoilCommunity,f0mxqq6,t3_d519zj,1568755536.0,"Any thought on the ""Grant for the web"" announce ?

Personally I like to have Mozilla involved (I would rather like Google as well, but I think this will go against their interests (ads)), don't take me wrong I tried Puma but some sites didn't work probably due the privacy settings, (currently using Brave on my mobile, which failed to load some sites but not as often as I experienced  with Puma)

Mozilla Firefox has a decent user base which also may have a % of the people willing to support content creators in a more ""democratized"" way (meaning paying to creators as you consume their content on demand)  instead of having to subscribe individually to each one paying a monthly fee (which may lead to actually only supporting couple of big creators) and letting aside small content creators.

I don't see this taking off soon (just like Coil itself) but I believe is a nice step, specially because having to install a plugin instead of rely on the browser itself (by supporting a W3C protocol) would it make the spread of web monetization easier/transparent for average users.

Worst case I think the ones willing to support content creators by micropayments will get the chance to support sites we regularly visit and content creators  will get the change to get rid of using intrusive (or just plain ugly) ads for users supporting them.

Ripple,erxojoy,t1_erxobgt,1561389870.0,"Thank you.

Ripple,erxlaw8,t3_c4hznd,1561387637.0,"Hi just ""my 2 cents""

Ripple's investment in MoneyGram may be a  bit more interesting than I thought for México corridor.

In México there's sort of a plague in the form of OXXO stores (convenience stores like 7-eleven, but these belongs to FEMSA group (Coca-Cola and everyting else [http://www.femsa.com/](http://www.femsa.com/)) and have +70% of this market in MX

Even in my hometown city (which is consider small with \~50k population)  are like 4 stores of these ones and you may find hundreds on big cities.

Back to my point, since last year Moneygram got in some sort of partnership which allows customer send and receive their money (international transfers) on OXXO stores (more than 18,000 OXXO stores acrosss Mexico only, and I believe there are some now on Peru and somewhere else in LATAM). Note: I don't know if the OXXO stores are counted/consider when MoneyGram says there's \~19K locations in México, but it may be the case because I don't see so many MoneyGram points on the city as Oxxo stores.

&#x200B;

Now this become a little more interesting (and **from here is pure speculation of my own**) when you know that OXXO stores already provide some basic financial services (they serve like a 1 pit stop for services and stuff)).

\-they provide debit cards which are also used to send/receive money locally (domestic))

\-Oxxo also works with Western Union.

\-you can deposit to bank accounts from OXXO stores ( BBVA Bancomer, Citibanamex, Santander, Scotiabank, Inbursa and HSBC. )

\-of course you can deposit FIAT in your BITSO account (MX exchange)

\-you can pay lot of home services (prepaid phones, home phone, electricity, water, etc)

\-Buy online (Amazon) and make your payment on OXXO stores.

&#x200B;

So, if MoneyGram's RippleNet implementation goes fine and OXXO (AKA FEMSA) stores are aware of its' benefits, these may open some new doors for Ripple (then XRP). **Not telling this is happening**, this is only **a grain of salt I'm throwing here** for the ones which are not familiar/didn't know/ or may think is interesting as I do.

&#x200B;

**update**

I have to highlight that most of the financial services OXXO provides runs on    [https://www.conekta.com/about-us](https://www.conekta.com/about-us)

And guess what is Conekta still missing... right, international services as of now Conekta is focused on domestic services until I've found.

note: Conekta is consider one of the most disruptive technological companies in México, is \~9 years old as of now and provide its' services to companies like Uber, Cabify, Amazon, Google amont others here in México and FEMSA is one of their investors.

So it may be worth it to keep on eye on them.

**update 2:**

OXXO is still not present in Brazil but there are some chances about FEMSA also getting into the convenience store market in Brazil. Which if you remember is also in Ripple's plan (I meant Brazil market/corridors) , this may be more a coincidence than a step included in Ripple's expansion plan, but again if MoneyGram partnership goes where OXXO goes then again it may be worth it to keep an eye on this.

Ripple,er67c6c,t1_er602cb,1560541485.0,"Asking, because I have relatives in the USA, wondering if would it be easier/cheaper to send money (personal matters) from USA to MX using XRP and exchanges instead of Wester Union for example.

Right now I know it has to be done manually (move fiat to exchange, buy xrp, send xrp, sell xrp and again move fiat from exchance to bank). Just wondering if it is in scope for Ripple to automate this whole process later if (let's say) we have 2 banks (1 in MX, 1 in USA) both using xRapid.

&#x200B;

\*\*note: It may be that SPEI doesn't settle instantly (I don't actually know that), but I know that I can use my fiat right away when doing SPEI transfer (up to a certain amount, seems big transfers get delayed for a reason I don't know) between banks in Mexico.

\*\*note: the 24 hours waiting I mentioned is for SPEI transfer from Mexican Banks to Bitso (mexican exchange) only, it used to be almost instantly but after some changes in fintech law/regulations now is required a 24 hours window to complete the transfer to Bitso(exchange)."
Ripple,er5pc7l,t3_c0flge,1560530732.0,"Hi anyone in the USA would it tell me what's the process to buy XRP/withdraw fiat and how much time/struggle is required considering you already have a bank account ?

Bit of context: I've transfered XRP from Bitso (mxn exchange) to Binance and vice verse.

In MX we can either do an SPEI transfer (system to local transfer across diff banks within MX) which takes 24 hours to be settled on Bitso due some regulation/law or make a direct deposit (cash) in a convenient store (Oxxo), which doesn't require the 24 hours waiting (haven't tried, but according to Bitso site it is instant). 

note: before doing the SPEI transfer from bank to exchange we need to register the SPEI account provided by the exchange, straighforward process which takes half hour to be ready.

Withdrawal from Bitso to my bank account are pretty much instant, of course I need to convert (sell) my XRP then transfer MXN (also SPEI transfer).

&#x200B;

And second question/doubt would it be, this sort of extra steps (going by myself to the exchange buy/sell XRP etc) are supposed to be removed later once xRapid is fully implemented ? I meant would banks/RippleNet automate the whole process:

bank source transfer to>exchange buy XRP-transfer XRP >sell XRP>transfer to bank destination ?

I've heard MX corridor is already working but it may be only for institutional (business) transfers not for the average citizen, please correct me if I'm wrong on this assumption.
