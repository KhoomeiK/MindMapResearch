Drain access is blocked because the neighbour built a patio over it and right up to the fence without checking the legal boundary.

They have lived there 30-50 years (since before i was born so not 100% sure.)

I would have thought it did, but it is really worrying my Nan so wanted to get some confirmation from people more educated on the matter than me.
