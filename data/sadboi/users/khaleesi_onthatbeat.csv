saudiarabia,fqwjay6,t1_fqwijph,1589706511.0,"The problem is people think they can be redeemed for doing nothing. 

The first step is admitting you did something wrong and asking for forgiveness. 

Keep asking for forgiveness. Realize how stupid it is that you keep asking for forgiveness for doing the same stupid things. 

Start trying to stop doing said stupid thing. 

Struggle. A lot. Social habits and lifestyles can be just as addictive as actually addictive substances. Changing our lifestyle can present actual withdrawal symptoms. Think like cutting sugar out of your diet or not texting that toxic ex or checking social media. Then we hate ourselves for messing up and feel bad. Ask forgiveness again. Keep trying. Go through plateaus, phases of denial (eh whatever i‚Äôll never be good at this so why bother trying, eh i‚Äôm terrible and so far gone and i‚Äôll never be worthy of God‚Äôs mercy) 

Ten years later, maybe less, maybe longer, you finally broke the habit and changed your life for the better. 

Or you died on the way while at least you were trying. God will reward effort and knows sincerity when asked for forgiveness. 


As for your point, i think that women and men both need healthy modest exposure and interaction with the opposite sex. By imposing in an early age in their minds that any thought about the opposite sex is haram or sexual or dirty is only making it worse. Then when it comes to college and they have female classmates they either hyper sexualize and objectify them and dont listen or see them for their ideas and contributions as people, or the women become too shy and untrusting because they‚Äôre conditioned to believe that men are all wolves. Men have it worse because they get less of the emotional support they need than women tend to do, but Its a two way street. You cant successfully teach your boys to respect and not objectify women if the only thing that women *seem* to be respected for is their objectification, until after they are married and had kids and are considered ‚Äúoff limits‚Äù ...you also cant successfully teach women to have healthy relationships or sex lives with their spouse  if they are constantly forced to feel ashamed for every little thing."

Everyone sins. In my opinion, eventually it catches up to us and we mature not only emotionally, socially but also spiritually. 

There are some people who would never pray and do tons of bad things and then one day or after something in their life changed they started caring more. Making changes in their life and behavior and modifying, finding better and less toxic or bad-influence friends. Criticizing, judging and shaming people has never inspired anyone to change their ways for their OWN benefit and they instead only feel forced to do it for the benefit of OTHERS. Which means it won‚Äôt stay rooted very long. Who knows what they say to God when they pray. Maybe they are struggling with addiction to drugs or gambling or alcohol. Maybe they have problems at home or a toxic upbringing that they are struggling to fix. You never know. So its better not to judge them. 

Better to just encourage them. Even for the sake of their spiritual awareness and building healthier habits. Tell him to put down the drink wash his face brush his teeth and go pray."

converts,fq65oml,t1_fq5ztwf,1589125012.0,"Schizophrenia is not caused by jinn üòÇ

Studies today have indicated that schizophrenia has genetic origins and is a heritable condition which most commonly manifests in older people after thirties, after our brain development is ‚Äúcomplete.‚Äù 
The trait exists in a persons genetic code, affecting their overall cognitive and neural development. Schizophrenic symptoms can develop in asymptomatic people as a result of some sort of trauma (mental or physical, such as brain lesion, damage from impact, or psychological trauma) as it triggers the gene to ‚Äúturn on.‚Äù 

It is as much a physical disease that is caused by improperly generated neural tissue like any other muscular or skeletal disorder. So would you then claim that a person who develops osteoporosis or ALS was also inflicted by jinn? 


‚ÄúSchizophrenia is a heterogeneous syndrome without any single defining symptom or sign and is unidentifiable with any known diagnostic laboratory tests. The diagnosis is applied to individuals with psychotic phenomena (hallucinations, delusions, and thought disorder) after other causes of psychosis, such as affective disorder or delirium, have been excluded. Many individuals with schizophrenia exhibit negative symptoms, including diminished emotional expression and reaction, diminished participation in interpersonal relationships, diminished production of speech, and apathy, with loss of energy, drive, and interests. While less striking than positive symptoms, negative symptoms may be more impairing and less responsive to treatment. The symptom profiles of bipolar disorder (which involves dramatic alterations of mood, with psychotic phenomena as a frequent accompaniment) and schizophrenia frequently overlap.‚Äù

[source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627306007227) 

The fact that a smaller population of Muslims are reported with schizophrenia has to do with 1) the pool of data available - mental health is still a taboo and poorly misunderstood subject, Muslims receiving proper psychiatric treatment and cognitive therapy for their condition and reporting their cases will be less 2) it is hereditary. If a study was made on only one race of people, especially since many Muslim cultures traditionally encouraged marriage and procreation within the same tribe or race, the genetic exposure is likely to be smaller 3) attachment theory and other social-psychological studies have proved countless times that having a strong relationship or attachment with their spirituality (ie God) family, the environment around them, and their self does have significant effects on a person‚Äôs well-being and ability to cope with daily stressors or traumas. Why schizophrenia usually develops in adults? They have the gene, something happens that triggers it, and they fall into a downward spiral as symptoms develop and become worse (for example, mild anxiety becomes full blown paranoia, occasional phases of irritability and despondence become chronic)

islam,fq4kzy8,t3_gflp35,1589079068.0,"From a linguists perspective: 

The Arabic language is incredibly complex. Words are derived from root letter combinations (because vowels are omitted) and zakat comes from the word roots that mean things like ‚Äúto uplift or increase‚Äù or ‚Äúpurify‚Äù za-ka) so in combining all these syllables creates a deeper meaning and greater understanding of the word‚Äôs contextual use. These are not just made-up nouns that were ‚Äúrevealed‚Äù and never existed before without any rhyme or reason. 

Think of a lot of modern day slang and even established words we have in the English dictionary now. 


Ex: 
‚ÄúCraptacular‚Äù - you know exactly what it means because of your understanding of its root word origins - crap + spectacular (LATIN *spectaculare +oracle*) 


So words like ‚Äúzakat‚Äù come a combinatiom of words‚Äô meanings to create a new word whose mean encompasses all of them combined"

If you‚Äôrw not a convert that space isn‚Äôt for you so why does it bother you so much? How many new muslims do you know and are personally taking time out of your life to guide them and show them everything and facilitate their learning like your parents did your entire life? Just leave them alone. 

The mod there bans people because they only come to remind everyone its haram to act on homosexual urges and then be condescending, disrespectful and derogatory to other people. Especially converts like myself that were raised to be tolerant and respectful to the lgbtq community and treat them like any other human being because they are still God‚Äôs creation whether you like it or not, coming into Islam and being bombarded with comments and slurs from a bunch of people like you is off putting and can make a person want to leave islam and regret getting into it because i see everything wrong with being disrespectful to people simply due to their sexual orientation. 

Islam is about tolerance and respect to all people regardless of their religion, race, gender, or sins. 

You are allowed to Think and feel what you want, but then dont complain about people who think differently from you and dont want you in their group. If you have a problem with the converts group then dont go there. You‚Äôre not a convert, so why should you anyways? 

If you want to have a direct impact on converts lives and teach things differently from what you see others doing there are plenty of other ways you can do that, in your own local community and online.

I get this impression because of things he‚Äôs said when the topic of marriage came up casually in conversations with us and our friends. He complained about how costly and show-offy weddings are, especially in his culture - how a guy will spend around 5,00$ in gifts just to MEET a girl after getting permission from her parents, and weddings are upwards of 50,000$ in expenses for the split gatherings, food and stuff, all just for people to then leave and complain and gossip about how bad the food was and how terrible the bride looks and how much the guy looked like he spent on the wedding...blahblahblah...

Which i totally understand anyone‚Äôs aversion to that. 

And i think to myself well gee i‚Äôm not Saudi so that wouldnt be so much of an issue for me! 

But he‚Äôs also mentioned all of the legal issues his uncle had with having a foreigner wife, and how she threatened to leave him because she was too culture-shocked and bullied by his aunties...

So he seems like because of that he‚Äôs not interested in marrying until he‚Äôs got more money and despite his personal reservations he‚Äôd just go the easy way and do some blind arrangement rather than deal eith any difficulties of having a foreign spouse.

Your condescending and dismissive attitude towards the struggle that converts like myself have is disgusting and you should be ashamed of yourself. Its because of people like you that people who are initially drawn to Islam are pushed away. 


I live in a country where the concept of heaven and hell and monotheism is extremely foreign to most people especially to children who have no exposure to it. Not every place in the world is like yours. Not everyone‚Äôs experience is the same. 

A couple clicks opens the door to a giant overwhelming tsunami of information about Islam. It‚Äôs incredibly intimidating. So are you suggesting that because i feel intimidated i‚Äôm not worthy of saving? Who the hell are you to make a judgment like that??? Imagine an already ignorant and lazy person who tries to do some exploring about Islam but gets bombarded with all of that information and jargon that makes no sense to them?

If you cant do that, welp you‚Äôre shit out of luck because everyone else does it and gets rewards and you are just obviously not trying hard enough you worthless waste of space try harder sacrifice more sleep and your family and your health and everything else that you like doing and memorize Islam perfectly or you‚Äôre not worthy!

I can google quantum physics but i still wouldn‚Äôt understand any of it and lack the background knowledge and fundamental skills to even be able ro study it. 

The Quran was revealed to the Prophet over the course of many years. The Surahs are not in order, either. It‚Äôs not a book a person can just read cover to cover. It‚Äôs a guidebook and has a TON of contextual significance, which is why the hadiths are so important. 

A basic understanding of Arabic terms is important too. 
Ya‚Äôll don‚Äôt even know how often i‚Äôm on here and googling random words people slip in with English qnd still not really getting the meaning. Arabic-Islamic terminology mixed in with English or whatever other non-Arabic native language a person speaks is a form of code-switching, a linguistic phenomenon wherein people use it for the following reasons: 1) ease of communication, some words come to mind or are easier to use and mix into a grammar system than others 2) replacing words because they are forgotten or unknown in the main language 3) solidarity and inclusion of in-group members and exclusion of others. 

When i heard people spouting verses and hadith references like Star Wars fans over-quote the movies, using jargon i don‚Äôt understand, i often feel like Islam is not easy at all and not as accessible to me. Not much unlike a person in a poor country with limited educational resources may struggle to find ways to learn English or other high-demand languages so they can study or work abroad. 

Even just reading a sentence sometimes i am struggling to parse it because of the numerous pauses to praise Allah or the Prophet or other important people with a bunch of filler words, i cant quite understand where is the subject and where is the predicate. Even translated versions, it still feels like i‚Äôm reading Shakespeare-style English and it takes me a long time to get through just a few paragraphs. And i spend so much mental energy just understanding the morphology and semantics that i have to read it again ten times to really get a sense of its *meaning* and then go google some more tafsir from ten different sources so i can try to understand it more. 

A lot of us converts are all self-taught. Born Muslims have the privilege of it being handed to them. It was taught to them like a mother tongue, they were raised and immersed in it. Sent to Islamic school on weekends and trained to read and parse the versus like i was trained to read and practice music. Exposed to it for years. 

Try telling a person they can just learn to play trumpet and become in love with it by just going online. Then try to tell a baritone player who reads a different clef of music to go online and learn the trumpet too. Not only do they have to completely undo what they already know so they don‚Äôt get confused, there are a lot of similarities but also a lot of differences. All the cool Trumpet players talk about cool trumpet things and only hang out with other cool trumpet players who know things. They discuss advanced techniques and theories and learn difficult music pieces. While the noobie trumpeter who learned from the internet and having no other sources to learn available to them feels like an outsider. And they wonder, gee, i might die before i‚Äôm even half as good as those people. And they dont even like me. They say ‚Äúhey wow its cool you‚Äôre learning trumpet‚Äù offer a few tips and then go about their merry lives. And come the next year they look at you condescendingly when you didn‚Äôt memorize those scales yet or havent mastered that one lip technique yet. And they think ‚Äúgee this loser must not even be passionate enough to try harder and work to get to our level. They can just click twice and learn its not so hard at all!‚Äù Man the only people who have a right to say something lime that is a person who has successfully learned everything with the same methods and resources. 

Saying these people have ‚Äúno excuse‚Äù is invalidating their feelings. Islam is intimidating, daunting, and very foreign to most people not born into it or exposed to it. Just learning about it in some history books or knowing the words from a Google search doesn‚Äôt make those ‚Äúsigns‚Äù or guidance from Allah. Many convert stories are not founded on that kind of story. I struggle to stay connected with Islam because i still have a weak faith and i try my best, at least i think so, and i take hits to my self esteem from Islam and the community every day. 

Maybe i would benefit from therapy too. But i cant afford it and dont have access to it. And even if i did, not all therapists are the right ones. 


Furthermore, you cant blame people who are yes exposed to Islam but fed lies and propaganda against it. You cant blame people who are poorly educated, vulnerable and ignorant and fed heaps of information based on algorithms.

The story of Lot - it was an abomination because those people were violating rules of war and raping anything that moved. What‚Äôs condemned and punished is their violent and nonconsensual acts. 

A person‚Äôs sexual preferences or desires are not a mental illness that a person ‚Äúrecovers‚Äù from. Homosexual fantasies and attraction is actually quite common even among heterosexuals, single and married. So are you going to suggest that a large population of the world is suffering from a mental ‚Äúdisease‚Äù? 

The problem is your toxic masculinity. Ya‚Äôll are okay with pornography and watching lesbians go at it, fantasizing about having more than one woman together, ignore it or are not disgusted by it at all. Women are always sexualized. 

There are no cases of people ‚Äúrecovering‚Äù from homosexuality like a person recovers from PTSD or ‚Äúmanaging‚Äù it with medication and therapy like schizophrenia. The fact that you claim to have a degree in neuroscience and still think this way about people who suffer from actual mental health disorders is appalling and i hope no one reads any garbage you may publish. 

Allah made everyone as they are, beautiful individuals. A trans, gay or lesbian person cant turn it off like a switch. A person can like what they like, they have a right to have preferences as long as its not physically harmful. So a child rapist having preferences? Thats a psychological disease, and its not even about sexuality in those cases but about obsession with power and control and using sex to control and hurt people. 


It‚Äôs not a sickness that gets treated and cured. And even so, a person with cancer or lyme disease or an autoimmune disorder cant just stop being sick. A person suffering from depression and anxiety can‚Äôt just recovery with sunshine and rainbows from some happy thoughts. 

Both are tests, and frankly i think Muslim LGBTQ people have some of the most difficult tests in life. May Allah REWARD them for their resilience and steady faith and accept their repentance when they ask for it. Ameen. 

And either way, Allah is most merciful and forgiving and the only thing that is unforgivable is shirk, so who are you, a mere human, to act so high and mighty and pass judgment? Is their personal life directly affecting yours? No. I have a ton of gay and lesbian friends and even then their personal matters are not going to change who I am or hurt me in any way, so i don‚Äôt care.

A lot of people also ‚Äúdo the right thing‚Äù thinking in their own mind that it is, when its not. Or its right for some people but not everyone. 


But why are all those things really the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing? Because Allah put it in our hearts to desire order and peace and feel valued and appreciated and want to give that same feeling to others. So plenty of people could fundamentally be ‚Äúgood muslims‚Äù but just not pray or worship Allah, and they are doomed anyways? Why avoid doing something wrong if you know you‚Äôre going to be punished as if you did do it anyways?"
Hijabis,fp6pl89,t1_fp6lbk8,1588356392.0,So i ask Allah for strength after every prayer and i still mess it up. So then am i supposed to blame Allah for my failures and not take responsibility for my obviously weak willpower? Am i supposed to stop what I‚Äôm doing at work to make more dua because i‚Äôm lacking in that too? Maybe he‚Äôs not even listening because i dont say them in Arabic.

Hijabis,fp6jio4,t1_fp6f6va,1588353415.0,"You cant call those things a blessing Allah handed to us because its not like it was something we acquired later, it was how we were initially designed so there is not even a possibility that it was ‚Äúearned‚Äù when we didnt even exist to earn it to begin with. And some people are not so blessed with eyes to see or functioning vision. 

But why else would our fasts or salahs not be accepted unless we do them all correctly?"
