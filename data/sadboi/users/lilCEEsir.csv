If you're getting a color on top of it (this can bring the appt. too around $300+ on the higher end) maybe they would put a more effort in. Plus, everyone will always need haircuts and colors so your spot will be filled. Some salons will separate journeymen and new stylists by price and let you know when booking, which is good. Not all salons are ran the bad way, there are really good ones out there but a lot of salons are horrible environments.

Rural areas are especially a target, because obviously you are less likely to get caught landing a giant flying saucer in a corn field, than you would in Brooklyn. In the next few years a lot more information of UFO'S and Aliens will come to light, way too many people have similar stories for it to all just be smoke and mirrors and we would be quite silly to think we are the only life form existing in even this universe, there's billions of universes on top of that too. Also the more tech advances, the more science points in the direction of making actual contact with other life forms. 

US government created mass loads of propaganda against UFO's and UFO experiences in the 60's when they first started being seen a lot. Into even know, they would interview really silly sources in the hills of Alabama, they would rarely show credible sources for UFO/Alien contact, so that most people would just assume anyone talking about aliens is crazy

UnsentLetters,fpohplg,t1_fpocgex,1588784687.0,"He said he noticed her cooking supper and picked a song for the next day.... do you think that's studying someone all day or noticing them through the window during one task? 
The problem with society is that we are always assuming a mans intentions are bad, and that our opinion is the vast majorities truth. it doesn't help when we add details that aren't even real into the story, ""watching her all day"""

Botchedsurgeries,fpo9d37,t3_ge78wg,1588780634.0,Dude this is uncomfortable. Imagine adding  30 pounds to your ass because everyone on instagram does it. People are starting to realize this ain't it.
UnsentLetters,fpo67cb,t3_ge9hkg,1588779077.0,"People want to call you a stalker or creeper. Um, how do you think people made connections back in the days? We made eye contact or met in person lol. Sometimes we would check out the people we like in real life."

BodyDysmorphia,fplg9fl,t3_ge41bz,1588712163.0,I have been in recovery for 2 years and I still won't let people take pics of me without posing. It's a tough one like yo that's what I really look like?
Mediums,fpl6qv0,t3_gdxm57,1588707355.0,"I am a clairvoyant, there was a time where I thought I was an empath, though.  When I first started changing(actively using my gifts instead of destroying myself), I carried protective crystals with me, and still do. Look for grounding ones and ones that are for protection. I personally really like my citrine crystal. Ground yourself  (whatever that is to you) and connect to the earth regularly, like feet in the sand or dirt or sitting on the grass during your meditations. Getting closer to light & source (God as some people call it) helps a lot with protection and you will begin to instinctively know who to block off. You will also get better at setting boundaries verbally."
wemetonline,fpl4703,t3_ge2hji,1588706060.0,"Sounds like he may need to take some time to understand your mental illness a bit more. It's hard to have discussions about feelings over text messages. is it out of character for him to snap on you for mental illness? It does take a toll on the people we love, we can't really deny that part (BPD, Diagnosed: 10 years) but if you are having a hard time, as a partner, he should try to understand. Maybe set up a facetime chat or skype call and have a conversation about where you are at and what you are feeling. If that does nothing and he isn't willing to admit  that your depression and anxiety exist then you may need to think about what you want to do going forward, because being in pain and not having validation during hard mental health times in your relationship can be very, very painful."
