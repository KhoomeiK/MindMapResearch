There’s a reason I believe that family and business is risky and doesn’t mix well it can work but very rarely you have to be able to deal with having a working relationship and separating your home life if you can’t do that then your not in a position to be working with these people.

We don’t have manuals when it comes to parenthood but there is room to learn from mistakes and then there’s also common sense if you see poor results then your in complete control of changing that if day in and day out he complains about not having the results he wants that’s his fault and you should tell him this he’s too blame. 

Yes you had a hard time at work okay I get that but when you have children you should be able to separate that life and devote yourself to your kids. 


I hate to say this and I usually don’t resort to this but maybe it’s time you scare him a little and give him an ultimatum that he either steps up and does a list of requirements that you need from him or you might be forced to make a hard descion  one that you really don’t want to make but that you’ll need to consider for the sake of your children."

I fail a test I tell myself “ wow I’m stupid I’m a failure I can’t do anything right” this is my perceived thought 

Then I stop myself and think but is that logical am I actually stupid and then I think what’s the truth 

“ no I’m not stupid I’m smart I am capable I just had a hard time but I’ll try again or move forward with something else” 

See when I tell myself the actual truth I’ve valued myself and admitted that I struggled but I validated my self and that’s important 

Overall I’ve worked hard to get to that point where I am a lot nicer to myself I still have my moments but this has been hard work

I have a similar story except this was my godfather anyways growing up I didn’t have any contact with my godfather and naturally I was curious who was he all I knew was that he had been a friend of my biological mother and they had a falling out this was pretty much the version I had. I hadn’t had contact with my mom for years at that point so when me and her reconnected in 2013 I eventually  asked her why my godfather wasn’t there and she grew very uncomfortable and skipped the convo. 

Anyways from that convo I started to feel like there was something she wasn’t telling me but I didn’t want to bother her or hurt her. So cue to last year I was with my godmother and some how the conversation jumps to my biological mom and she then tells me a secret apparently not only was my godfather a pedophile he was also the same guy and uncle who sexually abused my mother as a teenager. Yeah that was so shocking but apparently at first they didn’t know who he really was when they found out they where shocked and angry 


My mother battled years of mental illness and clearly wasn’t in her right frame of mind when she choose him to be my godfather and I’ve choose to forgive her for that because I understood her difficult situation 


I’m not trying to say this about your father obviously all I’m trying to suggest is don’t be too hard on your mom she may very well have good intentions why she didn’t open up to you about him"

Maybe list down all your emotions and how you feel about the situation maybe also include questions you have for her and don’t hold back how her choices have impacted you but try to also let those things go try to set some goals for the two of you to slowly gradually work and gravitate towards forgiveness the key is that you both need to do something it can’t be one sided but you need to make your intentions known and what you want from the relationship

You can be honest and have an opinion and that’s not wrong if all we said was what the other person expected then it wouldn’t really be a good relationship we all have things we like and dislike about your partners and as long as your not rude or that you don’t demand she changes something about her body then your allowed to your own thoughts especially considering again you where not rude. Your girlfriend needs to stop getting butt hurt and lashing out at her mommy every time she doesn’t like hearing something completely different then her own likes or dislikes she needs to start respecting that sometimes we just have to agree to disagree there’s no point in starting petty fights. I really feel it was immature and childish how your girlfriend handled this you can’t always run away to your parents when you don’t like something your partner has said. 

Plus if your girlfriends this shitty at handling criticism and feedback she really needs to get help cause that’s life not everyone is going to play kiss ass with her and some will say it as it is and she needs to be prepared to handle those things or else how does she function as a mature adult"
survivinginfidelity,fqanmrt,t3_ghjesc,1589222129.0,"I think right now helping your mom out just being the shoulder she can cry on will help her that’s really all you can do I would say creating some distance with your father is also probably best but most important make sure threw all of this that your okay emotionally too because watching someone you love get hurt can also take a tole on your own mental health he didn’t just betray his marriage he betrayed his children you can’t trust him anymore and the person you thought you knew isn’t really there so that I can imagine must be hard to handle 

Overall make sure everyone’s eating properly and keeping up with their hygiene lol this sounds weird but trust me when your in a state of depression or grief like this you can self neglect.

Also if your mom has stopped doing things she loved maybe you should bring this up to her

Like maybe offer to wash her hair maybe make a spa day give her some chocolates or maybe she’s just not in the mood to do cleaning maybe offer to help wash the dishes
