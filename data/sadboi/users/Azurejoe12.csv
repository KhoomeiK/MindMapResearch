Definitely the wrong word. Maybe saying the weather is uncertain or the weather is the weather.  It falls really on to their failure to fill that lexicon gap they have and so they grab what think might fit rather than the appropriate word. Coming down on people for not being savvy with words like a bag of bricks is kind of being silly and lends credence to the notion that bipolar people are batshit crazy.  Since we are not entitled and no person is; it falls on to us to moderate our own behaviors feelings. Best thing is to just put it down or not look for reasons to be offended an move on.
