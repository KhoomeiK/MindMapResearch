depression,fdpbsiv,t1_fdpbjrj,1578624690.0,"All I can think to offer a friend going through this is support: just being there for them for whatever they need. Most of everything else I'm thinking is probably very unhealthy advice like ""just push through it""."
depression,fc1rfwu,t1_fc1r8dj,1577327360.0,"I've been trying not to eat my feelings either. The hard part is making sure I still eat. The healthy balance is hard to find. Baking isn't really my thing, and my mother has taken over my kitchen, but what I take from your comment is the advice to find something to occupy myself with and sort of distract from the bad feelings. Good night to you too, and I hope you feel better as well."
depression,fc0p2zv,t1_fc0oq4b,1577296288.0,"Exactly, I think the guilt about feeling like this just adds to the feeling, and there is the danger of it spiralling down. It's nice to have someone to pull you out."
depression,fc0muuk,t3_effx75,1577294807.0,"I absolutely relate. My boyfriend is 3 hours away with his family, enjoying his Christmas, so I don't want to text him or call him to bother him with my depression today. I've been on the verge of tears all day, and the only thing keeping me from outright sobbing is burying my face in my dog's fur. I would much rather hide in my bedroom and not subject everyone else to my sour mood, but I'm being forced to socialise because it's Christmas. Hope everybody else makes it through this holiday season unscathed."

I'd be more than happy to help you with OL and we could form a group for that, or we could work on forming a D&D group in the area, in which case I will absolutely take you up on the offer to help convert my character. I think the hardest part would be finding a DM, because I'm sure I could find friends who would be interested in joining as players."

I don't remember which character said it, but the quote is from a book by Steven Galloway called The Cellist of Sarajevo and it stuck with me when I was first diagnosed with depression and has helped me ever since. It motivated me to look past my superficial labelling of people and remember that everyone is just trying their best to get through life, and that's all I can do as well."

Now I know why I feel certain things and what I'm feeling, but I'm still an emotional mess. I just understand why I'm a mess now."

relationship_advice,eqbxkqr,t3_by2mj2,1559958484.0,"Speaking as the cheater, you can get back with someone after cheating happens. But it's difficult, really freaking difficult. They constantly have a nagging insecurity that they aren't good enough and they get jealous at the slightest hint of someone else in your life that you talk to or spend time with. It takes constant reassurance and lots of care to build up the trust that was broken when you cheated."
