BPD,fho5pil,t3_f3z7r4,1581742341.0,"I completely disagree. Although I’ve had one bumpy marriage that ended in divorce because he was pathologically mean and another that ended because of special needs kids, I’m in a very successful, long term relationship. I attribute this to DBT therapy and an excellent mix of medication that fully deals with mood, depression and anxiety. I needed the therapy to understand BPD- which really never came out until the stressful ending of my second marriage.. I have tools to use, the medication has given me a level playing feel and the swings are gone and I now have the most excellent coping skills, including the app Calm."

Sorry I’ve been away. I did not hire one. My ex husband did.
No one will tell you  they take kickbacks."

Can you please tell me if there were any good parts? What were the bad? I so appreciate you reaching out."
troubledteens,ez1lj5g,t1_ez0or70,1567648824.0,I am so losing hope. I’ve been steered towards the DBT schools and cautioned about ALL the schools in Utah. Best of luck.

troubledteens,eyzvpbv,t1_eyymq9d,1567625611.0,"My daughter is in short term residential now. It’s been amazing. My daughter’s dad has talked her into Discover Ranch, because she will get her own baby cow. No way!!

I’m looking into a few places that were suggested on here and a local DBT center. Thank you so very much.
Bless you!!"
troubledteens,eyzvbq9,t3_czghi9,1567625429.0,"Yes we do, and calling insurance now. Thank you!!!"
troubledteens,eyyb4ke,t1_eyyao8o,1567578403.0,"She wants to go. I think we are all stressed and at our wits end. We fear her future if she doesn’t absorb some of the help. The short term treatment center near here is really helping. I think I’m going to look into short term DBT center. What would you do in this situation? We are so desperate, but I’m not going to make a bad choice. Thank you."
troubledteens,eyy9bva,t1_eyy8n7e,1567576237.0,"Hi,
Thanks for your reply.
I am so fearful about long-term residential treatment ; that’s why I came on here to try to hear success stories. She’s so suicidal, and that’s the only reason I am considering it. She has a very low average IQ. Dad hired a lawyer, no court mandate.  I’m taking steps to make sure she is protected when she turns 18. I’ve heard great things about DBT and might look down this avenue."
troubledteens,eyy8pym,t3_czghi9,1567575529.0,"I think you are right. All the schools/programs you recommended have great reviews. Her deadbeat dad wants to send her to a school in Utah- I am so fearful of them. I think DBT seems a good way to go. Thank you. I’m desperate to get help, but don’t want to make a bad choice."
troubledteens,eyy85pu,t1_eyy7xrg,1567574905.0,Thank you sooo much . I need as much input as possible! It seems that most therapeutic schools have horrid reputations- there have to be some good ones.  I’m going to ask my friend who is an educational advisor about these. Thank you!!
