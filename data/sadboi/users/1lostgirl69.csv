From what you wrote, it seems as if you went from h to kratom as a daily thing, which is what I'm looking at doing for a time, instead of just using completely kicking, bc circumstances won't allow,, I don't think, atm. 

 If so, how long did it take for you to get to a point where you could function and feel half way decent on just the kratom?

Agreed on the taste and vile texture. I'm grateful for kratom, but the texture and flavor is tortuous to me and I do believe tea would have to be easier to digest than leaf. I'm a huge wuss where those things are concerned."

I will somehow get it figured out. I'm just really nervous and flighty atm.

Point being, there's no age at which you stop growing, you're not a number or statistic. You needn't throw in the towel. You can still be a success. You weren't born with a clock as part of your physical makeup for good reason.
I know pain, not a time line is why you hurt so bad. 
Your step dad sounds like a child throwing a tantrum, but it really seems like all you need do is get a better game plan to become employable. There are a ton of free ways to get the skills needed to work in an office, sales, ect right online such as YouTube, Udacity, and Google has free online tutorials for the skills. As resume builders even Ivy leavgue schools like Harvard and University of Pennsylvania offer lots free online courses, be they just for the sake of interest or practical computer classes. They sure make nice things to sprinkle on a resume, so that you can get hired. 
Volunteer work also is good for networking, potential employers to take note of you, as well as getting you out of the house and building self esteem.. 
And never forget that your local library is free, and most offer a great deal more than books to check out. You can even get help making a resume, if not for free, do it on the cheap by enlisting  a college student. They can also tutor you in whatever skill set you need.] you need to land a job.

I looked at your profile and you are a beautiful girl, with a beautiful soul. OK. So maybe you won't go on to be the one that cures cancer. That's alright, but I just have a gut feeling (something I don't say lightly) that you have more to offer than a static and another premature toe tag.
Please tell me, if you could change it all with the snap of a finger, what would look different in your life. How would that scenario play out? I'm not asking for curiosity's sake. I'm wanting to know what I can do to be there for you. Can another person offering an ear make a difference?
I've lived with mental illness my whole life, and I'm what you'd probably consider to be old. It's definitely a hurdle that I wouldn't wish on another soul, but you are more than your diagnosis.

I suspect these are people who only pray when the lights are going dim in their world..
So many people have posted dramatic shit and suicidal intentions on Fb that I think it's caused people to grow even more calloused.
You were wise to jump to reddit instead. Funny how complete strangers are more willing to uplift us than people who are supposed to be giving a fuck.
Sadly, most people are so consumed with their day to day struggles, they don't stop to care until a tragedy passes, like saying  ""if only I'd known, I'd have been there"" after a suicide. Unfortunately, it just seems to be how people are. But not every person is so jaded.
I am poor as a pauper. Hell, I basically am a pauper. But I do have proverbialy broad shoulders, so to speak. Though, irl, I'm about as big as a flea. And I can make a genuine offer to hear you out.

It's a sweet thought, might even make it onto your local newspaper as a feel good piece, but I don't really think that's your intent or motivation.

You ask what parent would tell you that you should be more like your brother or why can't you be more like him. Actually, and sadly, many parents are like that. It's cold comfort, I know, but that's not unusual and it's not your fault, not one bit..
I have been depressed long enough to know what the exhaustion is like. The best thing I can think of is to tell you, is baby steps. Every minute of every day that you keep on keeping on is a victory over anyone who seeks to make you a mental wreck.

kansascity,ezucelv,t1_ezty7aq,1568149447.0,"But for many of us, that's our reality. People say people who commit suicide are cowards. But I doubt that is so. See, when you are truly suicidal it takes great effort not to kill yourself. So, really every moment you spend alive, is a horrendous thing to endure, that most will hopefully never know. All it takes is that one instant of ""weakness"" and everyone decides you're a coward.
I see so many people, like on this thread even, saying how they wished these people would have gotten help. But as one of ""these people"", by that I mean someone who has to fight to force themselves to live every single day, I can tell you that (and for all I know, you yourself, already know this all too well) when you go looking for help, there's not much available. Sure, you can call and talk to a stranger who you'll never even meet. If you're extremely lucky you may even get into a disgusting place to live, where you're surrounded by more desperate strangers. I mean look around up by City Union Mission. That place is so horrid that a bulk of homeless people prefer sleeping on the streets to being there. Many of those people aren't criminals, or bad. Many just got left behind. Many got caught up in the opiod epidemic, because some doctor over prescribed. Many are veterans.
Most people might be willing do something like volunteer in a soup kitchen around the holidays, which is fine and well. But very few are willing to donate a vehicle they no longer use, help by allowing an abused woman to live in their basement for a few months, or anything that would make a real impact..
We just don't go out on a limb for each other anymore, maybe we never did. Without that, or some massive change to get people housed, employed, off drugs and away from abusers, there is little to no hope."

But you have endured this far. Can you please commit to doing it just one more day? And tomorrow another?"
opiates,ezu8ifc,t3_d2cqsg,1568147346.0,Christ. I hate knowing someone across the pond is as miserable as I. Can you get loperimide? Just to see you through detox?
opiates,ezu64x3,t3_d2cqsg,1568146086.0,"Honey, methadone is its own nightmare. Plus, a clinic won't start you off with enough to stop your withdrawal. You are going to have to bite the bullet and call in.
It maybe, just maybe you can get some kratom. Take about 5gs to start and see if that doesn't help."
OpiatesRecovery,ezu4umw,t3_ca0bz2,1568145413.0,What about using something like emergen-c? Would that help?
abusiverelationships,ezq08jw,t1_ezpfalg,1568052510.0,I have plenty and I start tonight. Keep your fingers crossed please.

Still confuse me. I really am scared to the bones, but my time is running out a HAVE to do this. If only it were the only crisis issue I'm dealing with, but one catastrophe at a time and this must be first."
kratom,ezj01x8,t1_ezfkhrm,1567936279.0,Gotcha. I thought you meant for permission which didn't make sense.

God I wish I had support, a job or a car. A shelter would be fine if I could find a place to temporarily keep my cat."

Opiatewithdrawal,ezixsf2,t3_d0vw9z,1567935157.0,"Thanks. Your posts help me more than most. After URD I had chills for a good 6 mos, but that was from methadone and its famously long half life. Sounds dumb but I found a cure that worked for me in that time, place and situation. I'd go out in the sun and drink a Shirmnoff Ice, something I hadn't done before or since. Probably placebo, but worked like a damned charm
I know that's alcohol, but it didn't/doesn't present a problem for me."
