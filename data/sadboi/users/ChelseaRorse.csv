Always remember you have intrinsic value apart from anything damaging that has happened to you. You should have been protected and loved. I was sexually, physically, and mentally abused when younger to but not on a mass scale like you were. It has ruined my life. I try to carry on but it has a lifelong price tag. I have good and bad days. I am still here. You can make it. We can make it."
casualiama,fj2pt56,t3_fb4upb,1582950212.0,I am so sorry that happened to you. Sending light and love to you. I will pray for you.
AmItheAsshole,fioxlqi,t1_fi3bx9v,1582593367.0,"BRAVO üëèüëèüëèüëè Exactly my thoughts as well. That trip was worth the price of his daughter. Comparing money to a human being, at that ine you created, at that a child is disgusting. You don't deserve her in your life. I wonder how she is going to let men treat her in the future, being her own father threw her away over a trip. When/if starts dating shitty guys pat yourself on back. You taught her how men should treat her, an afterthought esp when it comes to choosing  money or her. Which can translate into anything. If she was the kid of your current wife you would have stayed. You don't like your ex-wife and the disdain shows towards your kid. I am glad your NEW family enjoyed the trip, lmfao. You gloat about it, you lil narcissist, then talk about your 14 you abandoned at an airport not talking to you. As if to imply she should be happy for your new family enjoying the trip. No wonder her mom divorced you. You are a character to say the least. If your new family means more to you than your ""old daughter"" then stay away from her before you cause more psychological damage. Maybe her mom was on to something..."
