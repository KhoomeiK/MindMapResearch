amazon,fqogl23,t1_fqnuood,1589514771.0,"Padfoot, no offense at all. I was trying to respond to your carefully laid out step by step response. I couldn’t locate it. 

I appreciate your loyalty. There is a cult-like atmosphere they’ve built. The ‘standup’ accomplishments, safety tip, stretches... not organic. Calculated. Employees are literally applauding themselves for a high TPH.  TPH is a metric which means ‘we moved more packages in less time with less people’. That metric LITERALLY means we are giving you more work and driving you to do it. 

You may want to look around your building and office and wonder why there are about zero people over 45. Think on that. Is it because the 45+ age group doesn’t know HOW to manage? No. Then where are they?

I’ve been working in the Amazon culture for 3.5 years. I’ve been in the business world for over 25. In that time I’ve worked solely for a company I started. It began with nothing more than desks and a phone. 

I have never actually had a job where I worked for others. Ever. My clients have ranged from mom & pop on up to fortune 500s. 

I joined amazon to get out and stop watching tv, stop me from grazing, and meet some humans. Mission accomplished. I honestly don’t care about the games played in business. I call them as I see them and how I have seen other companies function. 

From the high tower, The execs site dollar figures to validate themselves. They tried. Sadly, they missed the chance to shine. 

I care about the employees, my friends, the operations people who are getting placed in dangerous situations and cannot voice the same things I’m voicing here. 

Very simply, the location management has little to no experience on the floor. I know them. I know where they’re from. I know what colleges they attended and what degrees they hold. 

They did not have the type of hands-on experience that would allow them to react properly. They are in a culture that is built on the principles of reactive, not proactive. Living in the vacuum. 

Every measure you mentioned relied on the government mandates. Did we need a .006% infection rate to mandate masks (btw, by which floor management does not abide).

I laughed when friends told me that the break room was broken into ware house areas. Meanwhile, there were no accommodations in those remote areas. Just chairs and tables. 

Amazon PR insisted that we were bringing essential items to the community. Yet there we are, shipping non-essentials to countries worldwide. AND we were ‘flexing up’ to do so. 

To test this ‘Essentials only’ policy I went to the website and was able to order a $6000 wristwatch for 1 day shipping. 

The UPT forgiveness policy was 0% employee care and 100% litigious mitigation as ALL states called ‘state of emergency’ - and in states which that emergency still applies, Amazon now ignores THEIR company policy of not charged UPT during states of emergency (which was created to avoid litigation from amazon employees getting injured commuting during an SOE). 

The extra $2 per hour. What’s the message there? The people who worked during the first month of UPT forgiveness were NOT there for an extra $2. They were there because they HAD to be. Single moms with two jobs, kids paying the bills at home, etc. 

Sanitizing the building? This is logistically not possible. Not enough facilities workers, constant movement and workers, and buildings the size of 20 football fields. Do the math on the number of sanitization works inside a building that size. We can all agree the number is untenable."

If not, you’ll look perfect anyway. You have a great smile. Lips are very pretty. Go with a color that makes you feel comfortable. 

You are a natural beauty tho. The only essential thing you need is the hair cut.

amazon,fqhawb0,t1_fqgby0n,1589372846.0,"Let me be totally clear: i enjoyed, LITERALLY enjoyed my work in Amazon. Always have. Have great relationships with all management from the top down, they all know me by name, and I know them by name. I’m experienced in the business world, over 40, and I own a small home based business. I understand the difficulties in the business of Amazon. 

I work Within 20 miles of NYC - a VERY hot zone. between all shifts we have about 2k employees. I have taken the alerts which are sent via text and alerts is of new cases as the are reported and arrive at my percentage 6 cases per thousand employees. 

Unlimited UPT for a population who NEEDS that job is not a prophylactic measure to stop infection - also, that ended two weeks ago. 

I can give credit for staggered shift times to thin crowding - a measure implemented in mid-late April, as was social distancing. 

To get back to social distancing. Inside a sort center it’s impossible. The areas responsible for hand scanning each package and sorting them to pallets, The closeness of the pallets and the hands (people, 3-4 per lane) needed makes that policy literally not possible. 

Temp checks are very simply not working as indicated by the texts which are continuing to come at least three times per seven days. We all know that early infections are asymptotic while being fully transmissible. 

If I know this, Amazon HQ could have figured it out, too. 

The one very serious hiccup that I have to on then is the MANDATORY mask policy which wasn’t implemented until late in April. Before that, it was up to the associate (manly men and young people would never, and that was clear from the start). They NEEDED to be MANDATORY. It’s human nature. 

In terms of salary, a two dollar raise seemed nice, and it was. But that provides no safety. Double time was for those who worked beyond 40 hours, and not available to operations who are salaried. 

Employee relief fund? That was the most insulting of all. Instituted in early April it provided TWO weeks of paid leave for CONFIRMED covid cases. Testing was not available even within hospitals. When patients fit a loose profile, they were told to self quarantine and not positively infected. Because they were not officially tested or diagnosed, few of the cases fell under those guidelines. 

In the words of the chief of operations, late April, ‘our focus is on the safety of our workers, however PPE is in high demand in the front lines and we are focused on dedicating most supplies to them. Our associates will be cared for as supplies increase.’

amazon,fqf8cxw,t1_fqew0hu,1589320422.0,"This one is THE stat that made me laugh. I work at a Amazon sort center and, by my calculations (total numbers of workers infected per thousand) is currently running at .06%, National average is .01%. 

Also, Amazon has misled the public AND the workers. Amazon talks about ‘only selling the essentials’. Um, no, everything comes through. The day after they announce the ‘only essentials’ fiction, I was able to go onto Amazon and order a $4500.00 watch for one day delivery. 

The Operations guy on the 60 article talked about ‘social distancing’? This is literally not possible without eliminating 60% of the workers PER SHIFT. Sorting floor is and has been setup to maximize the amount of hands-on. In a 30 square foot chute area, there is less that 15 feet of open area. The remainder is stacked. Then add the four workers in that area. Tight. 

I personally have always liked the job. I work hard and am well respected on the job. 

However, Amazon was arguably 30 days behind  a very important safety curve which could have saved a LOT of workers.
