Agoraphobia,fr1k9ys,t1_fr1j9yl,1589821187.0,"Yea at this point I'm willing to try anything. I'm prescribed klonopin 2mg a day but only take half of that mainly so I have backups in case the doctors try and fuck me over with cutting my dose. But yea I know what you mean about just wanting to take klonopin forever and increasing dose but it's way to addictive of a drug and before you know it you become a slave to it and can't do anything without it. 
Good luck to you, I hope it all works out!"
panicdisorder,fr1f2fx,t1_ff7wbyq,1589818602.0,"Please do everything you can to avoid taking Klonopin daily. I take a similar dose as TiltedCrown (.5mg 3x a day) and I've been on it for 5 years. It certainly stops panic attacks but long term use is bad news. I still get shit panic attacks daily but I'm doing everything I can to get taper off. 

The bottom line, it helps calm you down when a panic attack is coming and it's a lifesaver but at the same time, it has had shitty long term effects on my mental health. I'm 28 and I already am having memory issues but benzos are a tranquilizer. Meaning it'll calm you down and numb your emotions. The problem with this is that it numbs all emotions, not just negative ones. I don't ever feel depression and sadness but I also forfeited my ability to feel joy, excitement, pleasure. 

Like TiltedCrown, I also have a history of seizures so it may be kinda necessary but all I'm saying is try to make benzos a last resort (at least for daily use). I'm on here now because I'm trying to get recommendations for SSRI/SNRIs to start taking for my panic/agoraphobia.    
I wouldn't say Klonopin has ruined my life because it does have an incredible impact on the severity and frequency of my panic attacks but at the same time it has made me numb to everything and I would give everything to go back in time and never start taking it daily."

kratom,fc369za,t3_efxdei,1577382481.0,"I’m in the similar boat as a couple of the people here. When I was in the Marine Corps, I was a VERY heavy drinker. However, while I was still in, after suffering some serious injuries, I was prescribed an insanely high dose of oxycodone which I got addicted too almost immediately. I took anywhere from 120-160mg a day. 

I mention the opiate thing because just like kratom, once I started taking those pills daily, my desire to drink immediately vanished and I felt as though my life couldn’t have been better. I was thinking more clear than at any other time in my life. Everything in my life was wonderful when I was taking them. I stopped drinking, started going to church, reading ALOT, taught myself how to trade stocks, etc. 

Unfortunately, I do believe this to be an illusion. When I ran out after 8 months of daily use, I went through the darkest hell of withdrawals after being forced to stop cold turkey. Once the withdrawals eased up after a couple weeks, I noticed my whole view on life did I 180 degree turn. Not necessarily bad but not great, just who I truly was without drugs. 

I started drinking heavily again after that whole scenario and because I was in the corps, they made me go to SARPS which is a military style rehab program. 

I got out, started smoking pot and taking adderal and klonopin for focus and panic attacks (contradicting drugs, I know) but then my friend reintroduced me to kratom (I had tried kratom in early 2012 to help with opiate withdrawals but it didn’t do anything for me, must’ve been a weak batch). The second I tried kratom again, combined with stimulants like Vyvanse, I fucking loved it. I still use kratom daily, probably 15-20 grams a day, but one thing is forsure is that I have ZERO desire to drink. Coming from a friend group of very heavy drinkers, I haven’t been drunk or even tipsy in probably 2 years. 

Unfortunately, I don’t believe kratom to be the cure all. Everything comes at a cost. I do, however, believe kratom is the safest, best alternative for anyone with an addictive personality. 

Kratom is addictive, contrary to what others may say. If you don’t believe me, try going a few days without it. But if you use kratom the rest of your life instead of opiates and alcohol, I think that’s the best decision you can make. 

Cheers!

Edit: I also wanted to add, Since I started daily kratom use in 2014, I can’t think of one time that I had any illness. Not even a common cold. Every year I get blood work done and the doctors are astounded with how perfect my levels are and assume I’m just very healthy and have a strict diet (I eat fast food nearly everyday lol). 
I’m not the only one either who hasn’t been sick and has perfect blood levels. Many other kratom users in the community have reported the same thing!"

For 1, it's clear that I'll get an error for not initializing x. However, I'm suppose to provide the code to correct the error. So I would assume it's the solution would just simply be: 

***int x = 1;***

***x=x + 1;***

***System.out.println(""X = "" + x);*** 

For 2, the semi colon sure doesn't belong after the for loop and int i needs to be defined thus is should look like: 

***int i;***

***for (i=1; i<= 5; i++){***

	 ***System.out.println(""Number is "" + i);***

MrRobot,f6ukn60,t1_f6rv0iz,1573164198.0,One of the most feels part of the show. Hands down.
MrRobot,f6rdlfd,t1_f6rbbts,1573100503.0,"Haha I just realized this last week after rewatching the show for the millionth time. After watching it a couple times through, I start to analyze EVERYTHING."

MrRobot,f6r6eiw,t1_f6r5xo3,1573094873.0,That’s a good point. Didn’t really think about that
MrRobot,f6qwbuq,t1_f6qvk45,1573087595.0,Oh you’re right! I always put that one together with the message from the DDoS in the first episode but yea now I remember that.
