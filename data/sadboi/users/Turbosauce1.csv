The big problem that’s arising is that we’ve been riding this wave of good credit for so long and that’s about to disappear because 1. People don’t want to give out loans and 2. People can’t pay off their previous loans because those same people aren’t working.

This is going to create a massive economic downturn that we haven’t seen in like, forever...and for every large corporation that gets bailed out there another few dozen small and medium sized businesses that go under since they’re not receiving enough assistance. People are going unemployed right now for sure, but I think a lot of people are also going to STAY unemployed when this is all over, especially in the financial market.

You’re correct in that the market has always been flawed and layered with fraud, but it’s incorrect to assume that because it can be a flawed market that somehow it’s not indicative of reality."
