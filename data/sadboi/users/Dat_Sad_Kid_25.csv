ThoseInNeed,fr2kj5j,t1_fp221a3,1589838902.0,"Yes, everyone else that has met the person has agreed with me I knew this through being friends with everyone in the group (I am pretty sociable despite my high anxiety levels) I am friends with my bestfriends family ad well but the problem there is one of their parents really likes the parent of the toxic friend, but as I've stated before I am friends with everyone in my friend group, no ones said anything but none of us like the toxic friend. (Due to multiple other links how they avoid the person and look exstreamly uncomfortable around them as well, I have links everywhere and can get any info I need in a very short amount of time which is surprising guess having many friends has its benefits) but the second issue is that the toxic person has made my bestfriend cuties with everyone, I'm the last one left only but just this last week they cut me off (texting calling ect) I asked if they were alright and we are talking again but I dont want to be the next and last person (I mean they cut off their other bestfriend of 4 years and they dont even talk anymore) its alarming and I feel like I will be next if I dont do something but they wouldnt believe me even if I tried so it complicated to say the least."

FriendshipAdvice,fdpmfvm,t3_emlnoi,1578632779.0,So my suggestion would be to not be friends (and yea I know it hurts I've done it before with a closer friend so I understand) drew doesnt seem all that nice and I would say get more friends that are kinder towards you (as it seems the others are fine it's just drew I would say not to waste time on someone who might not want you around you can do better) I feel as if you deserve better people cause you seem kind.

FriendshipAdvice,fdkx4m8,t3_elvjyu,1578512970.0,Coming from the other person point o view I would say something like this might've went down: maybe her boyfriend hadn't told her yet and surprised her (after all there is that saying family before friends) or maybe the boyfriend could got resent a text about it last minute and couldnt back out and they only had one car and the schedules didnt align at all I mean maybe it wasn't the person's fault at all from where I'm reading it anything could've happened and yea it does suck I would be a little sad too but it still could've been out of her control. But if you could find a way to go to the park it could work? Idk your schedule ofc but maybe something could work or you can plan something else another day she is there.
