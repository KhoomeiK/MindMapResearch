todayilearned,fmk3vsu,t1_fmjy2kh,1586143915.0,"Alright, so indentured servitude can be a form of slavery. The difference, I feel, arises among the terms of the indenture. Did you enter into indenture willingly or to avoid some legal consequence like declaring bankruptcy? Are the terms of the indenture clearly defined (e.g., perform X task for Y amount of time or that each  hour of labor is worth X amount towards your debt)? If those are true then I probably wouldn't classify it as slavery.

I've always made the determination based on the consequences of *refusing* the task. Back to my Switzerland example: If someone refuses their military service they aren't executed or beaten until they comply; you'd get a fine or maybe a little bit of jail time. So I wouldn't consider it slavery. Now if you were a woman who was kidnapped to be some sick fuck's wife/mistress, then that I would consider slavery. If she were to refuse it wouldn't be a fine; she would likely be raped and then beaten or murdered. If your antebellum South slave that argued for slavery were to decide to not comply then something similar would happen. That's always made the difference for me."
