Recently used magic mushrooms with meditation to help anxiety, dont ask how but showed me anxiety was due to gerd and shortness of breath.

It sucks but i try qnd think of the positives, even when its not logical. For exampke, its very hard to eat too many calories and get overweight with gerd, great 4 motivating me to research diets and try them"
