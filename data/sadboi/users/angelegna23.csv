That's important. That's what matters. I think it's important that we don't criticize what people choose to believe as long as their beliefs aren't harming another being. Personally, I get curious on why people don't believe...not to judge or argue with them or convince them to have my faith, but simply to have an open mind and understand them as a person. I get curious as well. Everybody has something that works for them and gets them through life and that intrigues me."

My biggest toxic trait is I push people away by not making enough time for them. Idk why I like being alone and I don't like to consistently communicate...I want to, but don't have the drive or energy to. Which can be a problem for some. I just like and appreciate my alone time. I have alot to work on when it comes to my mental health and my comfortability with others. I don't trust people. Anybody. 
It's not a good thing :(
but hey! At least I realize the problem?"

depression,fmckiq8,t1_fmbr66x,1585947426.0,It really is awful. That's okay. I think I just needed more of an outlet and some kind words to help me get through this time. I'm so mentally exhausted and drained. I almost snapped. But I need to be strong for my baby girl
depression,fmckdpc,t1_fmbhzwg,1585947352.0,Thank you. I'm trying my hardest.
