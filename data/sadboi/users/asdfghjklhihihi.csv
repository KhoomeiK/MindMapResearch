sleep,f46olk0,t3_djoi6s,1571411483.0,Hey! Would love to help - building out a way to make it really easy to talk to someone to understand and improve your sleep. We can set up a time to chat and see if that could be helpful to you. Email me if that sounds good at ruthie@jointherest.com.
sleep,f2yus5e,t1_f2c3gb6,1570498924.0,"Thank you, that makes a lot of sense. Appreciate the feedback. If you have any good ideas for how to reach people this might be helpful to in a non-spammy way, let me know. I really want to share it with anyone who might benefit but also not intrude on communities or spaces where it's inappropriate. Any advice or thoughts are always appreciated :) thanks again."

cantsleep,f285uqo,t1_f27wto9,1570053414.0,Hey! It's $30 for a consultation with the doctor. I think you can use it just to ask questions - my friend used it a few days ago just to get advice on how to fix racing thoughts before bed.
