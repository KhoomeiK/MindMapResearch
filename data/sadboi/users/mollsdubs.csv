They have been great so far in being supportive of my accomplishments and celebrating them with me!  And I know they want to see me happy with someone too.  And sometimes I feel like it would be nice as I wouldn‚Äôt be the single friend if I was with someone but I know I can‚Äôt allow that to be the reason to be with someone either."

Right now the app meetup is kinda the best thing because I‚Äôm able to meet people in person by doing things but my sole focus is whatever activity it is. If I talk to people, it‚Äôs not really an exchange of phone number or anything because I didn‚Äôt get much chance prior to Covid to meet people multiple times.

And thank you for your reinforcement of knowing it‚Äôs okay to feel this way. And thank you for the good luck! That is so much appreciated!!!!"

At one point I had put myself out there to just talk to people to make friends through an online app and had people that were nice to talk to and then as soon as they expressed feelings, I would run because I was terrified and not ready to try that. I‚Äôm trying to avoid hurting people getting feelings that I don‚Äôt reciprocate just because some other people thought we‚Äôd be good together."
relationship_advice,fp8gv06,t1_fp8f5n7,1588391962.0,"Manipulation is not a phase.  It is who someone is and unless they recognize that‚Äôs who they are and proactively try to change that behavior, they always will be that way.  Her anger towards you for expressing your thoughts, feelings, and questions is just one of the many manipulative things people like her do.  I know 6 years is a long time but there are so many more years to come in your life, do you really want to spend them constantly worrying that she‚Äôs out with other men when you could be genuinely happy with someone who thinks the world of you and only sees you as theirs?"

BreakUps,fo964cb,t3_g6f62d,1587611418.0,You say there‚Äôs no need to block him but obviously there is.  The need is to help you stop looking at his profiles.  To help you keep yourself accountable from seeing him.  You can‚Äôt just unblock him without there being a delay in re-blocking so it will keep you mindful about the consequences of looking at his profiles.
BreakUps,fn2bjpd,t3_fyiyw2,1586583485.0,Yup!  I do! 1.5 years later and still have them.  Now they mix with my most recent ex so it‚Äôs double the fun... (sarcasm) üòí
BreakUps,fn2beaw,t3_fysufd,1586583355.0,"I can relate very well to this post.  I‚Äôm someone that wants to understand where everyone is coming from and put myself in their shoes to get the full feel of it.  That ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù question loves to linger in my head!  I have no clue how the scenario came about and it makes no sense from any angle I try to see it from.  But... I‚Äôve come go realize that the why doesn‚Äôt matter, because the scenario still happened and that doesn‚Äôt change anything.  A ‚Äúwhy‚Äù is just giving them an excuse to justify their actions.

My new motto: No more excuses!  It happened, now learn from it and deal with it!"
BreakUps,fmwzx4p,t1_fmwwqib,1586455988.0,"I‚Äôm not saying to avoid the place always. But until you feel more moved on, take time away from that place. But that other commenter has a good point too."
BreakUps,fmwpqvw,t3_fxvl0d,1586450857.0,"So first thing to help yourself move on, avoid places that you shared with her!  You knowingly went to a park she went to with her dog always afraid of running into her and you wonder why you aren‚Äôt able to move on. You are hurting yourself by going to these places. You have to stay away from those places as much as you can.

Second, I know personally how it feels when your ex moves on quicker than you. More times than 1 too. It absolutely sucks to feel like you‚Äôre nothing because they have moved on. One thing that helps me is to remember that I have no control over anyone else‚Äôs choices but I do over mine. I have focused on myself and not worried about what others are doing in their life. It still sucks knowing that someone that loved me moved on so quickly from me but it‚Äôs nothing you can change. Focus on the changes you can make and things will get better."
relationship_advice,fmwkjq7,t3_fxrahw,1586448230.0,I wouldn‚Äôt say anything about your personal home situation to your boss at anytime but definitely not now.
relationship_advice,fmr7jv7,t1_fmr6qc4,1586315738.0,"I broke up with my long term relationship back in September 2018 and didn‚Äôt date someone else until July 2019 (mind you I still didn‚Äôt believe I‚Äôd find someone else to date).  He then broke up with me beginning of February because I couldn‚Äôt match up with another girl he‚Äôs always wanted that came back into his life.  It absolutely sucks not being wanted.  It sounds like your ex was upfront and honest about it with you; however, it completely still sucks being told you‚Äôre not wanted.

You said you recently broke up?  Honestly, best way I kept myself busy and still do is by just talking to anyone about anything really.  Conversations about random and odd things are good distractions from thinking about him constantly.  This also will help you feel like there is a chance to move on."
relationship_advice,fmr295z,t3_fwtoxw,1586312201.0,"I was scared too.  Honestly, I still am scared.  But I have to remind myself to keep an open mind.  To not think that he was the only one.  It will take time to move on, but that time is different for everyone.  Keeping yourself busy (difficult to do currently with Covid) is the best way to keep your mind busy to help yourself heal.  You always remember the good and learn from the bad.

You also said that you know he‚Äôs not the only sweet man in this world.  You‚Äôre already part way there to know that there are others like him.  When that man comes along and he wants you for the rest of your life, you‚Äôll be happier than ever.  It sucks to not be wanted (trust me, I know) but it will feel so much better to be with someone that doesn‚Äôt want to be without you at all."
relationship_advice,fmbr0pp,t1_fmbgfk4,1585931624.0,He lost his job and his apartment to not having enough funds. But I can see your point.
relationship_advice,fmbqws0,t1_fmbi79t,1585931567.0,She said in a comment she grew up with her mom and stepdad being alcoholics and getting drunk on a daily basis.
relationship_advice,fmb65ch,t3_fu6787,1585919353.0,"He knows your history with your family of alcoholics but that doesn‚Äôt mean he should have to tiptoe around you. You having grown up with your parents like that is absolutely horrific and I‚Äôm sorry for that, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to get mad at him when he gets drunk once in a blue moon (which isn‚Äôt even every special occasion as you stated he only drinks during them but doesn‚Äôt always get drunk). I am not condoning what happened, but you were sober and sounds like because of your parents, you treat all drunk people the same. That‚Äôs not ok to make someone else feel bad about themselves because of your past. That‚Äôs like being cheated on by one person and then constantly accusing the next of cheating because there‚Äôs a history.  This event could have been avoided had you not gotten snippy with him. I saw some ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù comments you made and if you‚Äôre making those comments, you should also say ‚Äúwhat if I didn‚Äôt make him sleep on the couch?‚Äù Maybe he would have never stepped out of the apartment. 

I don‚Äôt believe this is all him or all you but you should not just see your parents just because someone is drunk. This might be something you have to seek counseling on."

relationship_advice,fm6xxil,t3_ftgrl0,1585806584.0,"The best friend feeling you have with him is because you talk daily. That doesn‚Äôt make him a best friend. And because he‚Äôs being cold to you when you were upfront about not wanting anything more than friends with him, that doesn‚Äôt even show being a good friend. You‚Äôre young and to know that you didn‚Äôt want to hurt the friend that dated him first is awesome! You have great instincts! Guys like this aren‚Äôt worth worrying over."
Anxiety,fm6xj84,t3_ftgs8a,1585806228.0,Quit looking at the pictures. They aren‚Äôt helping. Find an app you can focus on taking deep breaths with to help calm you as well as relax you to fall asleep. You‚Äôre going to be ok. You‚Äôre not alone.

depression,flwu47m,t1_flwttee,1585565249.0,"It‚Äôs ok to be scared. I know I was scared too. And I know saying go in with an open mind is cliche and difficult to do when anxious, but trying to not expect anything is the best way to allow yourself to let therapy happen for you."
depression,flwtbeg,t3_fro7kl,1585564334.0,"Therapy is a safe space to talk about anything that is on your mind. Even these questions you have you can ask your therapist when you first walk in. As for the depth of your depression, it depends how comfortable you feel with your therapist as well as where conversation leads. Therapy also isn‚Äôt just a couple of sessions where you talk to someone and all you‚Äôre problems go away either. It is going to take time for things to develop, for your therapist and you to get to know each other, and like I said before, for you to feel comfortable with a therapist. Another thing to remember is that if this therapist is not someone you‚Äôre comfortable talking to or you just don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre able to fully trust this therapist after a few times, don‚Äôt be discouraged that all therapists are like this. Just like a relationship with a partner, not everyone fits the bill. You can ask or research for other therapists that might be a better fit for you."

BreakUps,fl7678j,t1_fl6arlj,1584895128.0,Sounds like it‚Äôs more settling for anyone and putting up with their flaws that you are against than actually being in love with them and their flaws.

relationship_advice,fi3uc2s,t1_fi3t9mj,1582127821.0,Oh absolutely! Definitely wasn‚Äôt talking about the history on first date or out of the blue sort of thing. But I agree with being clear about what kind of relationship I‚Äôm wanting.
relationship_advice,fi3sj6h,t1_fi3qkjw,1582126735.0,"I have tried to live this way with each relationship. I have been on the receiving end of being punished due to someone else hurting them and I never want to make someone feel that way.

I try to give others the benefit of the doubt before assuming the worse.

Would it be at all wrong to have complete openness with someone from the get-go to establish there‚Äôs nothing to hide?"
relationship_advice,fefkgo6,t3_eommem,1579058230.0,"Reminds me of my ex.  3.5 years together, he cheats and I was still trying to deal with it 6 months after I break up with him all while dealing with him wanting me back while he was dating someone else... and he finally says he‚Äôs done trying to be with me when I said I was talking and interested in someone.  That was a rollercoaster I was happy was over and be able to get away from.

Finally was able to move on from him and realize that telling him someone else is involved gets them to move on from your life so you can finally be happy again.  It‚Äôs odd that they are upset but at least now you will hopefully not have to deal with her anymore."

relationship_advice,ethhjbr,t1_ethgwrg,1562815686.0,Splitting things for the time being to be able to eventually get what she wants.  I‚Äôm just happy for you to be out of that situation and getting further along in your life like you planned.  Someone so much better will come along and be more than happy with whatever it is you give.  Relationships and love shouldn‚Äôt be based off how much money someone spends on you.

My schooling takes 3.5 - 4 years and moving to the Midwest.  Strain was put on the relationship and my schooling, and in the end, he wasn‚Äôt patient and willing to put in the effort he needed to do.

But it also sounds like she could possibly have been a gold digger and when it was taking too long to reap the benefits, poof.  Now that you have achieved your goals and dreams and are successful, she wants you (your money) back.  You‚Äôre better off and deserve so much more."
