BPD,fr3cfw1,t3_gmc5u2,1589854421.0,"That has happened to me before but I think it's because I knew he didn't feel the same way about me as I did about him, and I think on some level I knew that was the last time I was going to see him in person. I agree that abandonment issues might have something to do with it."
BPD,fqzf9w5,t3_gldph0,1589766144.0,"I didn't have a good experience with it. I honestly felt like my mood swings were worse on it and experienced a lot more brain fog than I have on any other medication. Towards the end I was crying almost every day. To be fair though, I was also dealing with the end of a bad relationship and it's taken me this long to realize that you can't medicate that pain away. But I was also on Zoloft for a good portion of that bad relationship and I felt much more in control. 

I'm glad it works for you; it just goes to show how different everyone's brain chemistry is. But if you ever decide to come off it, be prepared, because it's notoriously difficult to come off of. I won't get into all the details, but it took months for all the little residual withdrawal symptoms to disappear, even after I'd started back on Zoloft again."

BPD,fq6bwwx,t3_ggu3ik,1589128542.0,"I was in a situation almost EXACTLY like this with an FP a little over a year ago, minus the FP having a mental illness of his own. Hearing you describe your circumstances was a little uncanny and brought back some difficult memories. 

I felt more strongly about this person than I ever had about anyone. I hung on for months after he started to show signs of losing interest in me, even after he moved to a city a few hours away, because even though deep down I knew he didn’t feel the same way about me, part of me was still hoping that one day he could, and I genuinely thought I wouldn’t want to live anymore if I lost him entirely. I never told him how I felt because I knew I wouldn’t get the response I was hoping for. 

I knew I was unstable, and I tried to fix that while still keeping him in my life, mostly by trying different medications, but this unhappiness wasn’t something I could medicate away and I think on some level I knew that. It got to a point where I had horrible mood swings, cried every day, and did a whole range of impulsive stuff that I’m not going to get into. I had unfollowed him on all social media while still remaining friends with him so I couldn’t see all the things he was doing without me or all the girls interacting with his posts. I did the same for a lot of our mutual friends. Mentally and emotionally I was a mess. However, this was before I’d looked into the possibility of a BPD diagnosis, so I didn’t really know exactly what the problem was. 

I finally ended things last spring, telling him that I knew we were never on the same page to begin with and I couldn’t heal and have him in my life at the same time. I think he understood. We haven’t spoken since. It was the hardest decision I’ve ever made, and it took me months to get back to a place where I was stable again, get the right diagnosis, and figure out a med combination that worked. And those months were one of the most difficult parts of my life. I’d had other FPs before, and things had gotten bad, but I’d never clung to one for such a long time or spiraled that hard. I can only imagine how much worse things would have gotten. 

As hard as I tried, I couldn’t stay connected to this FP without sacrificing my mental health. In order for me to get to a point where I was okay, I had to remove pretty much all traces of this person from my life. I unfriended him on all social media, stopped going to places we used to go together, deleted his number, etc. I had to build a whole new life for myself without this person in it, and I think that’s what makes it so hard for people like us, because our identity revolves so much around our relationships with others. The only advice I can give you on how to get over this is to end it. Remove him from your life, then if you really still want to be friends with him again, wait a long time, and when you think you’re ready, wait some more. I still don’t think I could do that with my old FP, and it’s been over a year. I still think about him all the time and I know if I spoke to him again I’d just fall right back into that spiral. 

If there’s other people you care about strongly, like friends or family, start reaching out to them instead. Things are going to be awful at first but it gets a little better each week. It does get easier, it just happens slowly. It’s not easy to end things but it’s still possible. I believe in you!"
TwoXChromosomes,fppzd6k,t3_gesio6,1588812100.0,"I never really understood the whole “men get incapacitated by colds/the flu and women are basically fine” thing because I’m a woman and illnesses have always hit me really hard. It usually takes me about 2-3 weeks to completely get back to normal. 

How often I get sick really varies and depends a lot on how many other people I come into contact with. I don’t get the flu very often, maybe once every 2-3 years. I get my flu shot every year so I think that helps. 

I get colds much more often. I went to a huge school for college and would sometimes get sick multiple times a semester (it would always happen at least once). After I graduated, I got sick much less often. For about eight months, I worked in a lab with the same 10 people or so every day and I don’t think I got a cold once. Then I started work at an extremely busy coffee shop, sometimes ringing up hundreds of customers a day, and I got sick three times within the first three months of working there."

Then you pour them into a little receptacle and hot water gets mixed in with it. The machine does most of the work, and after maybe 30 seconds the coffee comes out of a spout and it’s ready to go. Apparently they’re really expensive, and a lot of stores that have them are getting rid of them. I’m guessing it’s because they don’t sell enough of them to make up for the cost.

It was super crowded, so I don’t know if he saw me, but my instincts told me to get out of there. At the very next stop I made my way off that bus and hid out in an ice cream shop for maybe 15 minutes, then I walked the rest of the way home. 

It’s totally possible that there was a completely innocent explanation for all this. It was a very popular bus route that a lot of students took to get back to campus, so maybe he wasn’t trying to follow me, but even if that were the case, I stand by my choice. I’ve heard so many horror stories and getting back to my dorm 20 minutes later than I normally would have was a small price to pay for feeling safer. Always listen to your gut."

The last time I was (sort of) dating someone, I was so happy for the first few months. I lived for the euphoria that came with feeling loved (I wasn’t, but it felt like I was). The highs were incredible, but the lows were devastating, and when it all ended, I felt like I had no purpose anymore. Like the universe had created me specifically to love this one person, and since he didn’t feel the same way, I had no other reason to stay alive. 

Idk. I value love a lot, and one day I do want to get married and have a family. I guess I would call myself a romantic, but I definitely think that the BPD has something to do with it."

BPD,fc7gmup,t3_egh67v,1577506844.0,"I was always really sensitive and I have a family history of mental illness so I think that put me more at risk, but I had a lot of issues as a kid that weren’t handled very well. I think that’s where it started, but I had a long string of bad relationships over the course of the past few years that really solidified the fear of abandonment. I already developed depression as a preteen, but somewhere along the way the emptiness and the bad coping mechanisms started and it just felt like something worse. I feel like there was a lot of minor stuff that happened especially during my teen years and it just sort of snowballed. That and the genetic predisposition to mental illness kind of screwed me over."
BPD,fc6nv63,t3_eg9jt7,1577485044.0,"Holy shit, it’s my birthday tomorrow, and I feel exactly the way you do now. Like I’m dreading tomorrow because I’m too sick to do the things I had originally planned to do, and now without any stimulation I’ll be stuck at home thinking about how this time last year, I was with my old FP and how alone I’ve felt this past year. I’m planning on going to a drop-in support group, but I still think it’s going to be rough. I hope your day is at least getting better, I know what it’s like to have a rough birthday and it’s not fun!"
BPD,fc20mcg,t3_efahf1,1577335812.0,I used to when I was a teenager. I’ve had a few relapses since then but I’ve found it just doesn’t provide the relief it used to
