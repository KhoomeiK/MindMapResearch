Ooof thank you i'm 30 and and got disability and section 8 at 25. I have never been able to enjoy it and I have been always on edge with my bpd even thou I go to so many festival never have to work and am a-ok in this downturn of economy. IN fact

SOOOO true, I got a free ELECTRIC  ca just 2 years agor thru california cap and trade program a free $10000 CAR [https://money.com/incentives-free-electric-car/](https://money.com/incentives-free-electric-car/). In fact the gov paid me $54 after the PGE rebate!!!  


But... Carmax lied and said it had a quickcharger to charge 90 miles in 30 minutes!!! But now it takes 5 hrs because carmax omitted that feature and wanted to charge me $200 to move it from LA to fresno and I couldnt keep doing that!!!. I was bummed. But it serves 99% of my life , I have not needed do maintenance or pay for GASand oh Yeah

The recent coronavirus means I get $11,000 in unemployment vs the $1000 I normally get. Social security won't let me own $2000 unless it's either in an able account or I buy a car and due a plan for self achievement. There are 2 programs for $5000 for going EV so $10,000, I know I qualify for 1 waiting for the other. My spark electric is worth 6-9k... Used bolts are 18-22k+ fees and wholesale market is about to tank on them because lease returns on the 17. New are $27000-28000 and there are much more rebates that i have mentioned... so about the car I REALLLLY want.

People who leave the workforce and go on disability qualify for Medicare, the government health care program that also covers the elderly. They also get disability payments from the government of about $13,000 a year. This isn't great. But if your alternative is a minimum wage job that will pay you at most $15,000 a year, and probably does not include health insurance, disability may be a better option.

## Will refusing a job offer jeopardize someone’s unemployment benefits?

If you are receiving unemployment in the U.S., it is generally under the condition that you provide documentation that you are actively seeking work, and that you will not turn down suitable employment opportunities.

Conti said there are some exceptions that may arise during the COVID-19 pandemic, but only under particular circumstances: “You have to take that job, absent some really objective extenuating circumstance that you are older, that you are immunocompromised and you are more vulnerable, or you live with somebody who is,” Conti said, or you can prove that your employer is calling you back under unhealthy or unsafe conditions.

One major caveat to this rule, however, is that many states [**have loosened or eliminated their job-seeking requirements**](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/employers-and-workers-impacted-covid-19-expanded-unemployment-programs-have-arrived) given the current circumstances, so Conti said you should be sure to check your state’s unemployment website if you are considering turning down a job while receiving these benefits.
