ptsd,f8ndoij,t3_e12eh2,1574642231.0,I had to talk to police and write out what happened so many times that as this point when I tell someone what happened it’s like I am just recounting a bunch of facts
ptsd,f6jkipy,t3_drhqdr,1572896092.0,Not door knocking but the sound of someone running upstairs or pounding towards my room gets me. Even in situations now where I know it’s other people going in to their apartments and I’m completely safe I’ll still feel like they’re coming to me and will get very on edge.
ptsd,f6jjl6d,t3_drix9x,1572895694.0,"No I totally get this and go through phases where I’m like this. I feel it’s me trying to find someone just anyone who understands. I also talked to a family member in law enforcement and he told me it’s a common sign of ptsd/trauma, sometimes people get stuck in a loop and just go over an event time and time again to try and process it."
ptsd,f5nw61w,t3_dodvm2,1572304846.0,"I have a few different experiences that I suffer PTSD from. Abused as a child, death of my mother, and death of a patron while working as a lifeguard. Over time the abuse PTSD has quieted down but the PTSD from death has been running rampant for me."
