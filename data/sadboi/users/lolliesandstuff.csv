It’s time to stop doing the negative things that you’re doing and learn some self love. When you exit an abusive relationship, you come out worse than when you went in. Imagine yourself how you are now, but add PTSD, and all of the physical and emotional scarring. You come out worse in every way imaginable and in a few ways unimaginable. 

Get counselling ok?"
relationship_advice,fft9wgp,t1_fft9ofn,1580213808.0,"I have a similar guy who wants me for him, not for me (if that makes sense).  He was abusive.  I tried option 1, it didn’t work.  I then went with option 2.  He didn’t get the crystal clear message, so I blocked him.  It took 6 months for him to finally stop calling from private numbers, but I’m free now.  It was worth the blocking! 

If you give someone who has hurt you a clear directive and they keep trying, they don’t respect your boundaries or care about you at all.  Remember this if it comes to blocking him.  It helps to remember this so you don’t feel too guilty.  

Good luck."

I think you have two options, the first being a slow ghosting.  Take days to reply to him.  Don’t involve yourself in discussions with him, be polite but short.  Slowly increase the time between contact.

I’m surprised you haven’t given up on sex with him earlier tbh.

I do think it’s laziness on his part.  I had a bf like this once.  There was one time 3 years in, when he actually put the effort in and I nearly had an orgasm, and I remember it cementing for me that he was a lazy fucker that cared more about himself than me.  Sure, he would always make a cursory attempt for a minute or so that didn’t feel good at all, but I think it was just to show that he made an attempt so that way he could get onto the business of his orgasm. 

Next time you have sex, tell him he’s not having an orgasm until you do.  Actually make sure you follow through on this, don’t just give up part way through.  If you don’t have an orgasm, then stop having sex.  You need to tell him that you have to have  ‘you only’ sex sessions where he works to get you off, without him getting off at all.

You say she’s got a lot in common with you, believe me, she doesn’t.  Sometimes when young insecure girls have a crush on someone, they take on all the hobbies and interests of their crush and then the crush thinks “I can’t believe how much we have in common”.

Also, it’s wrong of you and inappropriate to be spending all of that time with the sister.  

Also, I have two sisters who have endometriosis that would be far worse than what your fiancé has.  Your fiancé will be able to have a baby.  Both of my sisters have been able to get pregnant.  One of them, her endometriosis is so bad that she has a panel of experts at the hospital that meet to discuss her case.  To give you an idea, her endo grew around her bladder and started to squeeze it, leading to severe bladder complications.  Then for a while then, every time she got her period she was in the hospital because she would feint from the pain.  She managed to get pregnant after 6 months of being off the pill, she had to have a cesarean, and then when this was going on, it was so difficult to get him out that they nicked her bladder, so she needed surgery immediately after the birth.  She intends to have another baby at some point, but then after that she needs to have a surgery to separate her bladder and bowel from the endo, and will be wearing a colostomy bag for some months, and once she’s healed, will then have the bag removed and everything all connected up as it should be.

I was led to believe we did a good job and that the programs had lifted Koala numbers.  I think this was true to a large degree.   Now we’re right back there.  Between Chlamydia and the fires, I feel like the Koalas are fucked.  And it’s not the government that’s done it, it’s every single person that has ever stepped foot in this country (except for the native Australians, who knew how to take care of the land).  The extinction of an entire species is really a world wide problem, and we can’t hate any particular person, because we all share the blame.  

When I see photos and videos of firefighters or cyclists giving Koalas water due to heatwave or fire, I feel so incredibly sad.  Sad that the koala feels that fucked, that it puts aside its survival instinct to stay away from people, to get a drink of water.  

We’re all responsible for climate change and the destruction it’s causing.  I think we can all donate to that."

I also thought from your post that your ex likely has NPD.  I didn’t want to say it cos I didn’t want to make assumptions.  

I think it just takes time to get over it.  Don’t be too hard on yourself if it feels slow.  I think adjust your expectations a little.  I feel like mine will take 2 years or so until I’m mentally clear enough to date.  Just be kind to yourself xx"
relationship_advice,fd66wio,t3_ek5hb3,1578186399.0,"Yes, it was rape of a sort.  I had an ex with NPD, that was big on pushing me into sex and having sex without protections.  He sexually abused me a lot.  When I look back on our sex life, the majority of it was abuse or manipulation in some way.  

The only way to move past it is to accept it, and accept all of it.  Part of accepting it is getting over the self blame you’re feeling; that feeling that you allowed this to happen to yourself, so it’s partially your fault, because you should have pushed him off you and left the house and be done with him.   But you didn’t do this right? You were confused and muddled about it.  

You have to accept that you were manipulated, so you couldn’t do what I’ve described above.  It’s almost like, you know theoretically that you were manipulated/sexually abused, but you can’t apply that to the actuality of the situation; that you were manipulated so you couldn’t do what a rational person would do. 

So you need to accept that it’s ok that you didn’t just fuck off, that it’s not your fault that you didn’t, because you couldn’t do it, because you were manipulated.  

Also, think about how this degenerate of a man did this, and that these actions are unique to him.  If you think about him, I’m sure there were other things he did that were red flags.  Other little manipulations.  Other men are not going to do this to you, it was this manipulative fuck only.  Think about all of the other red flags, think about how it won’t happen again because you’ll spot them now and you’ll know what kinds of people to avoid.  

Also, think about how it won’t happen again, because if it ever happens again, you won’t be confused or manipulated (and you won’t), because you’ve thought about it enough and you understand what happened, and it won’t happen again because you won’t be confused, you’ll just get up and leave."
relationship_advice,fd64ewa,t1_fd30y6x,1578185381.0,"I think the teasing and flirting is a positive, women love to be flirted with by a man that they like.  

For myself, sexting prior to having sex isn’t something that I really like, but it’s still something that I’ll occasionally do because if I like a guy, I can feel this expectation that I have to do it.  So I’ll do it, mildly, but dissuade it as much as possible.  I much more ok with it after we’ve had sex.  

Maybe this is just me though, ok? Not all women.  

The partial nudes you’ve done are ok I think, I don’t think they’ll create any false expectations.  I wouldn’t worry about that at all.  I think it’s good that you haven’t sent full nudes.  When you think about sex in its entirety (sexting is a part of sex), you only ever get to see someone naked for the first time once.  It’s an exciting and nervous moment (pleasurable nervousness), and it happens once, so it’s better in person.  

It does sound like she really likes you because she’s keeping up with the contact, and it does sound like you really like her because you’re concerned about all of this stuff.

Yeah, attractive women will have many partners, some of them will be fuckheads, some won’t.

My mother and sister are obsessed with serial/spree killers, particularly Ted Bundy.  On at least 50 occasions, when they’ve randomly started talking to me about him and going into detail about what he did, like for no reason at all, I’ll say “you know how boring I find this, right?” Or I’ll say “I really can’t hear about this anymore, sorry”.....and they’ll pause, visibly shake the story out of their heads, and then talk about normal stuff.

As a side note, I think for women, masturbating to porn is a definite preference over someone’s nudes, because porn is more interactive in the visuals you receive (whether it’s a still image or a video), because there’s a whole fantasy that goes along with it.  For myself, I also don’t want to masturbate to someone’s nudes, because I’ll create a fantasy in my head (to a small or large degree), that will substantially raise my expectations on first time sex with the dude, creating an impossible standard that won’t be fulfilled, which will lead to disappointment, and lacklustre eagerness for further sexual contact on my part.  Does this make sense? It is better if I romanticise the dude first, and build towards fantastic actual sex, rather than create an epic fail with my expectations.

What you should do then, is dump this girl and look for an emo girl who is slightly reckless and has a sense of adventure.  You’ll both end up poor, because you both have uncertain careers, but you’ll be able to talk philosophically about shit while you drink cheap wine (because it all tastes the same, is probably made in the same factory, and with the expensive ones, you’re just paying for a pretty superficial label).  You can both lament how other people don’t ‘get you’, and they don’t understand about life, cos all they do is work and they don’t talk about the deeper issues, and life is not all ‘ok’ and ‘happy’ like they make it out to be.  

My sister had a friend like this, and the friend dated a guy like this.  They’d turn up to cocktail functions and have to leave because he would forget to bring shoes.  She’d turn up to functions 4 hours late.  One time we were all invited to someone’s house for a party.  The owners of the house had a pet snake.  When we all got home, she pulls this snake out of her bag and told us that she took it because “her and the snake, really connected on a deep level”.  We took it off her and returned the snake the next day.

So I don’t know, maybe dump your gf and free her from your self involved emo-ness, and then buy (or steal) yourself a snake and really connect with it."
