I have self harmed and not wanted anyone to know. And I have self harmed hoping someone would ask me about it. Obviously, every single person is different and has their reasons."

EatingDisorders,eyjtfgd,t3_cx9x3l,1567127775.0,"First of all, you did the right thing. My personal opinion is that you don't really have anything to make up for, rather you should let her know that you did what you did because you love her and were worried about her. And you want to support her and help her while she gets help. 

I understand her feelings too. Eating disorders carry a lot of secrecy and shame. It's very hard to admit you have one, especially to yourself. It's possible in her mind she really doesnt feel she has a problem. However I really feel you did the right thing.

Give her time. It may take a while, but she needs to recover and get help and some day she will understand you just wanted to help her."

The fact that she is even disclosing to us that she has any kind of problem is already tremendously brave and admirable of her.
