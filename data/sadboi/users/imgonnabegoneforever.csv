SuicideWatch,fpmzhnd,t1_fpmmc6v,1588745826.0,Hug you. Wish we can all get better and begin to love life somehow.
Needafriend,fpmdizy,t3_geamya,1588730716.0,"Hey, I just experienced a very rough breakup too and still trying to find a way to heal. I have been suffering from major depression and severe anxiety for 4 years. If you wanna talk with me, please message me. I need a friend too and I think we have a lot to share.
I’m a weirdo too and 26f btw."
SuicideWatch,fpmbin4,t1_fplxgb6,1588729511.0,"Hi, no offence, I just want to share some of my thoughts. I have a friend who has been living in Ethiopia. He shared with me the attitude of people there towards life and this pandemic which brought me deep reflection. Ethiopians believe we are a part of the nature so we have to accept all including the dark side of the nature too. Their acceptance and attitude to coronavirus is much more placid than we imagined. My point is, we shouldn’t judge those countries and people from our own perspectives pitying them in so called third world countries with little food. We formed our value and greed in our own culture and environment but this is only a very small part of the world. They may not crave for money, lots of food, entertainment as much as we do but still have their inner peace due to their value, belief or anything else. I don’t know, again no offence, just sharing. Hug you."
SuicideWatch,fpm576f,t3_ge25rl,1588725801.0,"I have mental problems and am struggling a lot. My experience is a bit stupid, when I searched for toxic people online and just found those traits fit me and those pages ask people to stay away from people like me, I feel much worse. I have been trying hard, very hard, but all I got is blame and misunderstanding. Those information amplified my guilty too, making me even messier and feel unworthier."
SuicideWatch,fpikct6,t3_gdgtna,1588642709.0,I feel you.
SuicideWatch,fpijc6i,t3_gdbli1,1588642104.0,I would say death is the easiest solution to everything. I’m also struggling with it.
