EatingDisorders,fql9njz,t3_givuuy,1589451153.0,"I was honestly doing the same and just being in complete denial. I used to binge eat and I remember just thinking ""i hate you, I hate you so much"" whilst eating, I felt as though I had no control over it. The only way I could stop the cycle (personally I know it can have the opposite effect for others) was to remove those foods completely. I'm now 5 months on keto and I've lost almost 20kgs so far, I finally feel like I have control around food and although it's still hard and I'm still struggling I can't imagine going back to binge eating ever again. 
In terms of her, I think she needs to come to a decision herself to stop. Be gentle because she probably isn't her own biggest fan right now, please don't mention how attracted you are to her at all, maybe focus it on showing the kids they can do anything and to use this quarentine time for good."

And I doubt anyone will be buying houses in a few weeks.. As for chaos, the government has been very very bad at keeping this under control and I'm positive that there are more cases that they just haven't checked yet. So many people have been in contact with someone with corona virus yet they're doing absolutely nothing about those people. Plus there was a suspected case of corona virus on a train last night. They took the patient off and then continued to the destination as if nothing happened."
China_Flu,fj9i4c5,t1_fj9horm,1583149345.0,Glad to see you're staying calm
PandemicPreps,fj9gbin,t1_fj9g6h6,1583147213.0,"I definitely would make sure I wasn't spreading it. Wear gloves, sanitize and wash hands often, wear a mask if going out. The house is a good 15 minutes in the car from the nearest town, so I don't think I would be a risk. If I go, I will self isolate for as long as possible, a good 2 weeks at the least."

Coronavirus,fj6tgav,t1_fj6svff,1583079793.0,"That's the biggest tell for me. He's never skipped it before, who skips an event like this for a runny nose? Who has to stay home because of a cold?"
Coronavirus,fj6840l,t1_fj67x3a,1583061487.0,"If I had any trust in this government before, it's completely gone. They just want to keep the economy stable for as long as possible, no matter the lives it could cost."
Coronavirus,fj67rpj,t1_fj67qk7,1583061010.0,"The fact still remains- only people from Italy. That's an issue, don't you think?"
Coronavirus,fj67lk0,t1_fj67jsa,1583060765.0,"Until now, they haven't. Of course, now that it's public knowledge that he went to a book fair they can no longer cover it up."
Coronavirus,fj677mg,t3_fbsic0,1583060215.0,"The government here is being absolutely ridiculous. Our president has said it's just a cold and it will go away in summer about 10 times now. They're not testing Portuguese people, only Italians and one Japanese guy. Also, I've heard that many people have come down with ""pneumonia"" all of a sudden. I wish they would do more to combat this, this whole downplaying it thing is only going to bite us in the ass..."
Coronavirus,fizyu7y,t1_fizy0p2,1582880881.0,"If there's one thing I don't want to run out of during a pandemic for a virus that causes diarrhoea, it's toilet paper."
China_Flu,fizxy1g,t1_fizws70,1582879647.0,Definitely not overreacting. This woman just came back from an infected area. She could very well be spreading the virus.
China_Flu,fizxqbe,t3_farqju,1582879355.0,"Everything about this is shady. Globally. For everyone else's sake, act as if you do have it. Self quarantine if you can, use a mask, wear gloves, constantly disinfect. Prepare for the worst and expect the best. I'd also reccomend monitoring your temperature twice daily."
PandemicPreps,fiymzcw,t1_fiymg0l,1582842614.0,Thank you! That's a great idea.
PandemicPreps,fiykvei,t1_fiykmor,1582841387.0,"I think the whole ""only once a day at 6pm"" was sp they could start informing us less. Now 100 people could go in overnight and we wouldn't know a thing until tomorrow night."
PandemicPreps,fiyk21f,t1_fiyjjcc,1582840918.0,"Yes, every day at 6PM. Though apparently that means 8PM because that's when they came out with it today. The information seems dodgy and I don't trust it at all. I live in crowded Lisbon so I'm acting as though there's a good amount of infected people around me, because there probably is. I've even heard that a large amount of people that were sent home better now have it again. There's just so much we don't know about this thing yet."
PandemicPreps,fiyi17k,t1_fiyhqui,1582839803.0,"I wouldn't. So many people have just come back from Brazil and Spain because of Carnaval and are coming back into the school system. 1000s of kids stuck in a small space? I mean, have you seen how the normal seasonal colds spread through those places? Keep them home for now, their health is more important."
PandemicPreps,fiyg57b,t1_fiyfx86,1582838761.0,"It's scary as fuck, isn't it? That's exactly what I'm going to do. I think we're going to cover it with cardboard and tape it up, hopefully that works well. I'm worried about contamination through apartment toilets, but the facts seem a bit dodgy with that so I'm not sure."
PandemicPreps,fiyet3w,t1_fiydeqr,1582838026.0,"I know. I don't know why it took so long. I think they're hiding something honestly. Also, they're only testing people from Italy and one person from Japan. Even though there was a school trip to northern Italy in a large high school here and several people just came back from Brazil and Spain after spending Carnaval there. They're doing the same thing as the USA. Covering the numbers up by testing the least amount of people as possible. I think they're also trying to ease the public into the idea, slowly starting to say things like ""we need to prepare for the first case"" ""it's not a matter of if but when"" and telling business owners to be prepared to quarentine their stores in the case of a sick worker."
PandemicPreps,fiy8wzc,t1_fiy4on9,1582834842.0,"UPDATE: The tests all came back negative, but there are now 2 new suspected cases."

PandemicPreps,fiy4on9,t1_fiy3nb8,1582832454.0,Literally nothing! They STILL haven't said anything. The news and radio keeps saying we'll know soon.. but it's been almost 2 hours. It's crazy.
PandemicPreps,fixg06i,t1_fixfurd,1582819702.0,"100% get that, the only reason it's weird is because they've been updating as they go for around a week now, even as late as just this morning."
PandemicPreps,fixdfro,t1_fixd9wo,1582818182.0,"Thank you! I already have everything I'll need. I'm already quite scared because I'm immunocompromised. Also a bit nervous of being locked down in an apartment building where the sewers and fireplaces are connected. Anyway, I wish you health!"
PandemicPreps,fixdaly,t3_fadfnr,1582818096.0,"I'm wishing you and your family all the health and safety. Well done on preparing for anything, definitely a smart move! I'd also buy extras for anyone in the community with a child in need who didn't have the information of foresight to do the same. Cynically, those items could also be used to barter in the worst case scenario."
Coronavirus,fixb929,t3_fadl33,1582816873.0,"I think so? They found the virus via anal swab. So, maybe leave the ass eating for a few months."
Coronavirus,fiwq4c7,t1_fiwotps,1582797619.0,"Absolutely ridiculous! I went to a shopping centre to get my last supplies yesterday, I wore a mask. I have no immune system, I'm not going to risk my life so I don't get embarrassed. People were yelling and laughing. I hope my seriousness on the matter at least convinced someone to take it more seriously. And I know there are others taking it more seriously too, I went to 7 pharmacies and only one had masks left. Everywhere is sold out of masks and hand sanitizer is next."
Coronavirus,fiwob4t,t1_fiwo6zj,1582794938.0,We also need to be thinking about how dangerous it would be in Portugal. What are one of our biggest populations? Older people. And the amount of diabetics and other people with immunodeficiencies ( myself included ) are also at risk. I'm angry at the lack of insight and action not only nationally but internationally. I worry for those (especially the older people) who don't even know the risks right now.
Coronavirus,fiwo6zj,t1_fiwo067,1582794767.0,"I feel as though we have to research to find much about it and only now have the ministry of health decided to do updates and take it a bit more seriously. Still, doctors are saying we're not prepared at all. And yes, *these* cases are Italians, but if it's in Spain, in China, in Brasil, and in Italy, odds are it's already here. People are acting like absolutely nothing is wrong, no one is preparing, and people have just travelled to Spain and Brasil for Carnaval and are now going back to school with absolutely no testing done. I would bet everything I own that it's already spreading quietly in Portugal, and this attitude of keep calm and carry on and let's only tests Italians is only going to hurt us further on down the line."
Coronavirus,fiwnu4a,t1_fiwnm8f,1582794243.0,"Sevilla, it's right on the border. A lot of people in Portugal go there quite a lot. And we also have to think of workers such as truckers and transport officers that are crossing the border multiple times a day. And yes, with these people it's not related, but with it being spread in Spain I doubt it's not being spread undetected in Portugal already."
Coronavirus,fiwj4sv,t3_fa8dyf,1582788052.0,"Thank you for posting this! To add, a Spanish border town is infected with coronavirus, so the odds of these next tests coming back negative seem low."

DiagnoseMe,f6w880j,t1_f6w531p,1573219690.0,"I have depersonalization, maybe it'll help if I describe my episodes. Basically, I feel as though nothing is real and I'm watching my life happens as if I have no control over it. Constantly thinking about what life and reality is, being terrified of the unknown, having sudden strikes of debilitating anxiety. It felt like I was going completely insane, I was so scared I'd never feel normal again. 
What I've found is that even just knowing that it is a disorder and I wasn't going insane made the highest difference. Socializing and being outside made things feel more real, and refocusing my thoughts (although very hard) keeps me grounded. 
There are possible medications and therapies for this too and there are a lot of resources online."
DiagnoseMe,f6vzrr6,t3_dt9iz2,1573209778.0,"Maybe depersonalization? Have you had trauma, are in a stressful point in your life, had a bad experience with drugs? Any of those can cause that."
