SuicideWatch,femq4t3,t1_felp9ez,1579266304.0,"I'm very sorry you had to go through that. No kid deserves it, not even 1% of it. It's very sickening to say the least.

I very well understand that whatever is going on in my parents' heads is not simple, and definitely not as simple as ""Let's torment our kids lmfao.""

Both households in which my parents grew up were not ideal for children. I don't know much about my paternal grandfather, I was 6-7 when he died, and I remember him as a very nice and compassionate man. Throughout most of my childhood, my parents, sisters and I were living at my grandparents'. It was us, grandparents and two of my aunts. And so when my grandfather was alive, he was always there for us when Dad was going mental. As for my paternal grandmother, she's the worst. She made the lives of all 8 of her kids hell. She was physically and emotionally abusive. She once heated up a metal stick and burned my father with it, cut his hair while he was asleep because it was ""too long for a guy"", and her standard method was to whip him. For any reason. My father looks at these instances as good memories, as trophies, rites of passage, as the steps that led him to become the man he is. 

As for my maternal grandparents, they weren't doing well, they only had a 3-bedroom house. But even so, they had 7 kids within 9 years. Holy fucking ass, condoms people, ever heard of them? I know my paternal grandparents had more kids, but they had a much bigger house. My mom was the eldest of her siblings and so naturally they had her help with way more than what you'd expect from a teen girl. She was a third parent and had basically no privacy growing up. As far as I know, my maternal grandmother was very sweet, I was 12 when she died so I remember a lot about her, she used to hug us and kiss us when we'd visit, and also give us candy. According to my mother, my maternal grandmother was the same way even when they were little. But now, my maternal grandfather, I was 11 when he died, and I do remember him as a nice guy, he was, to us at least. But to my uncles? He was abusive towards them when they were growing up. Mom says he never hurt his daughters, he was only like that with his sons. 

My parents, aunts and uncles all had shitty childhoods. Many people here did, and of course, many children still do. The culture and religion here promote a crazy toxic concept of parenting. Children are told over and over that they owe their parents a great debt they could never hope to repay. They are told that their parents provided for them and cared for them all those years, and that they have to support their own parents when they grow old. They are told that that they owe their parents absolute obedience, and have to respect them unconditionally. What saddens me more is that when people spit out that shit, they don't bother with mentioning limits or boundaries. If you ask them, ""Is it okay for a father to kill his child?"" I'm pretty sure many of them will tell you that it's not okay. So they have the line drawn somewhere, they just won't usually bring it up or think about it. I hate that it took me that long to break free of all those years of brainwashing, but on the other hand, most people don't at all. 

I guess the point I was trying to arrive at is: While it is true that abuse can create more abuse. In my society, many people justify this abuse and even support it. The culture itself and the religion enable it a great deal. 

Mental health awareness is almost non-existent here. The younger generation seems to be more understanding of these issues, which makes me smile."

>I read everything you wrote. Listen man, your brother needs you to be  strong for him; he needs you to be there. Your brother is experiencing  the same thing you are, you two are bonded through your experiences, and  you have the ability to do something that no one else in his life can  do: understand him. You understand his situation because you are living  it with him. 

Given the huge age gap between me and him, my parents are not the same. They're still incompetent fucks, but not the same incompetent fucks from my own childhood. My brother hasn't been subjected to the same abuse that I have, but this environment is still not healthy for him. My parents do tend to yell at him occasionally, and my trash can of a father did end up calling him names a few times. Yes that's not as bad as what they made me go through, but it's still unacceptable. I barely see or talk to my dad (I always try to avoid him), but I always communicate with my mother and sisters on the ideal methods of parenting. I try to ""coach"" them on some random stuff, like for example they can't just put rules without justifying them first (he has to understand why every rule is there and why, and if they can't think of a good reason, maybe they should rethink it). 

>What you're doing, many never do; you are seeing past the illusion,  you're exploring new ideas and understanding things in a broader scope,  don't knock that ability, it saves lives. The trick now is to not let  yourself get carried away, simply understand and accept the reality of  the situation and use your advanced understanding of the world around  you to your advantage.

I'm sorry, I'm not quite sure what do you mean by that. I have been tormented by these thoughts and flashbacks for so long now, I think about it a lot, day and night. It kind of forced me to think about it and try to understand it. Is that what you're referring to?

>Your brother needs you man, he needs you to teach him how to be brave in  the face of adversity and how to think in an abstract way, because if  you don't do that for him, no one else is going to. You will doom him if  you leave him like that, there's nothing you can say to him that will  ease the trauma of losing you and he will be forever scarred, if he  doesn't take his own life in return, having lost his brother. 

I know. I'd love to stay with him forever. He's my favourite person in the world. I want to see him become a normal person, functional in society, who's capable of forming healthy relationships with people. I don't want him to turn out like me. My parents dropped the ball big time, they can't do it again. I hope he lives a happy life, with or without me.

>Instead, I would offer you to accept  what you understand, accept that your parents are not providing you and  your brother with what you need and work to fix it, for you, but more  importantly, for your brother, he can't do it himself and he needs his  brothers' guiding hand in these years, he needs you to give him what  he's missing, all of your siblings do, even if they're older than you.  
>  
>You  have to break everything down logically, consider the options available  to you, and determine the best solution for you and your siblings,  these people that share these experiences with you. I do not know your  family, I can't provide the right questions to ask or solutions to  better your situation, but you do and you can.  
>  
>Take  some time away from the distractions, away from the games and internet.  We use these distractions to escape confronting life, everyone does,  because we have to escape reality from time to time or we'd all go nuts.  Our entire society is built around distractions for this reason. If you  simply offer a small amount of time each day to research your future,  you will end up saving everyone around you, even your dad.

I have accepted that fact so long ago. I've been kind of protective of my younger siblings (I'm the eldest, got two adult sisters close to my age, a teenage sister and then my little brother). When my teen sister was born (I was 8-9) I promised that I will never let my father hurt her (it saddens me that a 9 yo has to worry about something like that). Now, if my father does something stupid, and actually hurt my teen sister or my brother, the police will be called right away. I will do what my stupid mother never did. My siblings need to understand that the police is there to help us, they're not the enemy, our stupid parents are. My country improved its child protection laws a few years back, and they were trying to raise awareness about these issues (they're really common here).

My father and I had a confrontation about it a few months ago, it wasn't really concluded because of how shit my dad is at handling these situations. But he has an idea of how I am going to handle the situation if he actually thinks abusing his own children is the answer.

I have been thinking about a solution for so long. At first I thought I'd move out after graduating and getting a job (in my society it's unusual for adult children to just move out, you're expected to stay with your parents unless there is another reason). I was also thinking about leaving the country altogether. However, as time went on, and as I kept getting more hopeless, I came to the realisation that divorce would solve everything. I have had so many talks with my mother about it. No matter how honest or broken she seemed, every time she'd make me believe she'll get on with it, but of course she never does. Is it Stockholm's? Or is she secretly getting off to this? God I'll never know.

When dad leaves town for a while, or travels, my siblings and I are actually able to feel comfortable in our own home. We can actually sit together, talk freely, play, go out. We can just live, have a normal life. That's why I think divorce is the best answer, it doesn't only help me, it also helps my siblings.

But don't hold your breath, divorce is crazy stigmatised over here. She also says shit like, ""I haven't divorced your father in my young years, you think it makes sense for me to do it now? It's just not possible.""

Yet she still feeds me false hope when I bring it up. 

>Which sounds better to you honestly:  1. Letting your dads unintelligent parenting ruin your lives, or 2. Rise  above his bullshit and become more of a man than he could ever hope to  be, then telling him it was in spite of him.  
>  
>I  guarantee the latter will make him realize everything he's done,  because you've given him undeniable proof. Get so goddamn big and bad  that he couldn't kick your ass with 16 legs and a wish.

Well, our lives are already ruined. It's just damage control at this point. It takes no effort to be a better person than he is, he's really a moron. He is unable to regulate his own emotions, he's impulsive, moody, impatient and has no self-control whatsoever. 

In the solutions I mentioned above, the common factor is my dad isn't with me. I want him gone, I'd rather have him pay for what he's done, but that's out of the question. I want him gone so that we can start healing. How do you heal a stab wound if you're getting repeatedly stabbed in the same spot?

raisedbynarcissists,f4puuq0,t1_f4plaqa,1571743280.0,"I live in a society where that's actually the case. Romantic relationships outside marriage are not recognised, sex outside marriage is illegal, and all are heavily frowned upon. Arranged marriages are the norm, and people are *expected* to end up in a marriage and have kids too.

So when you have a society that encourages everyone to get married and have kids, and paint it as the ultimate goal of life. And when you make two people commit to a marriage before getting to know each other well enough. You end up with a lot of dysfunctional families, unhealthy marriages, unhealthy relationships and twisted concepts of parenting. Especially that even people unfit for parenting are also pushed in that direction, feeding and pushing this vicious cycle of child abuse.

I digress, but my point being is that many people here never really bother asking themselves if they're ready for kids before having them. Abortion is illegal and frowned upon. And they view children as a gift from God (which, funnily enough, doesn't stop many people from abusing their children). After I had confronted my mother about it a while back, and asked her if she ever asked herself if she was ready for children before having me, she was very baffled and confused. Apparently the concept of preparing for children *before* having them is foreign to her, and I bet it's the case for many others.

I've had to use the last option mostly in situations where I had to play as a sickly infant. Where I am bound to have a deadly illness as an infant/child. In which cases I had to keep repeating the life until I could have a kid of my own."

The last one hit me really hard. I just can't eat with people around me, it makes me very uncomfortable. Just gotta take my food to-go and find some sweet empty parking lot. 

Actually, I just prefer to not be around people in general, and I don't have my own place yet. So it looks like I'll be spending a lot of my time in parking lots for now."

It has always seemed to me that my pick is secured the moment I chose a hero. And that my hero spawns when the hero select screen is over, and all I have to do is exit the screen when it pops up again. 

The reason I believe this is the case is that I've never seen people randomly deselecting their heroes. I can only see it happening to me, when it's actually happening to everyone."

I doubt the POTG logic is that complicated, and it shouldn't be IMO.

I have been experiencing a similar issue, it would seem that I got disconnected, sometimes kicked to the menu. But in reality I am still in the game, my friends see me as only AFK. After a while, it takes me back to the game. 

If that is the same problem then I'd be a bit happier knowing the fault is not with my connection."
