AmItheAsshole,fptgmzz,t3_gf4knq,1588890893.0,"NTA. Adopted children will almost always struggle with adapting to a new family - especially older ones like Jess. I really do empathize with her struggle, and it sounds like you do too. Her struggle doesn’t mean that it’s okay to cast you aside, though. They absolutely should have consulted you on this, and they should be making sure every step of the way that this process works out for you. They should not expect you to give up your privacy and share a room with someone who is essentially a stranger. They are the ones who want to do this - they are the ones who need to accommodate the two of you, not the other way around. I hope you’re able to get some form of family counseling and at least get a wall up in your room. Please let us know how it goes, we’re all rooting for you."

danganronpa,fnkwyjp,t1_fnkwwdf,1587042070.0,"Pretty much. A lot of the “worst character in the franchise” is a principle thing. If I’m ignoring that, Angie is the worst."
danganronpa,fnkwsx1,t1_fnkwkvt,1587041960.0,"Large part is that Byakuya is my favorite in the franchise, and then there was this sudden dramatic switch to a very different character that was purporting to be my boy. Part of it is also that he seemed kind of bland, especially compared to a lot of the other characters. He just kind of bored me. Mostly, though, it’s cause he did my boy dirty. No one does my boy dirty."

startrek,fj5vmwb,t3_fbl9cd,1583044798.0,My mom and I used to see episodes like that and just call them torture O’Brien episodes. It feels like Star Trek really hated that man.
EatingDisorders,fj05d61,t3_fasutn,1582889716.0,"For me it started as a situational thing but it quickly turned into intentional starvation. I was overweight already and that combined with some pressure my dad had been putting on me for years as well as my own body image issues led to restricting. At first it wasn’t too often or too much, but that changed pretty fast. Now I feel guilty pretty much whenever I eat. I’m down to one or no meals a day (usually, today was three!!) just because I feel so guilty about eating. I check my BMI religiously (whenever I find out my weight, I’m not allowed to see the scale) even though I know it’s a flawed system just because I’m praying that it’ll be a normal BMI. I keep telling myself that I’ll stop restricting when I reach a healthy weight (which I’m honestly already at, but my ED doesn’t see it that way) but I doubt that. I hate the way that I looked before and the way that I look now, but at least now I’m not as fat anymore."
startrek,fj04zxs,t3_faisxh,1582889284.0,My mom and I really didn’t like it. I think they’re really great friends and I think it should have stayed that way. There just wasn’t any romantic chemistry between them and I don’t understand the relationship on either side. It disappointed me actually because I felt like it kind of cheapened two really good characters.

startrek,fip8i8u,t3_f91x7h,1582600396.0,"Kira is so fantastic and honestly one of my role models. She’s the epitome of a badass, strong woman and was one of the first women really in charge on Star Trek. Not to mention that she was not only a strong character like that, but they were also able to successfully integrate religion into her character, something a lot of writers struggle with. Religion does not define her, like it does with so many other characters you see, but it isn’t nonexistent either. I’m not religious myself, but I think she is such a good example of a religious character and one of the best I’ve ever seen. When I first watched DS9 a few years ago, I found myself looking up to her more and more. I didn’t really like the Odo romance much, but Nana played it so well that I didn’t mind. I am just such a huge fan of Kira. I wish we got more characters like her in more modern media."
StopSelfHarm,fip706o,t1_fip6kwo,1582599418.0,Thanks!! My psychiatrist told me to work on better coping mechanisms so I’m going to try doing this more. Here’s hoping!
StopSelfHarm,fio5n40,t1_fio16u5,1582576765.0,"Thanks man! I bought some oil pastels on sale a few weeks ago and I’ve never really used them before, so I’ve been thinking about trying to channel that energy into that. The writing idea helps, I have some writing stuff that’s kind of been sitting there gathering dust so maybe this is the time to pick that up again. Luckily I see my psychiatrist today so I can try to talk to her about this stuff too!"

startrek,fed4q8r,t3_eoiy1z,1578998762.0,"When my mom and I were watching it a few years ago, I was probably around the same age as him. Whenever someone else in my family saw him on screen, the response was almost always “Ugh, Wesley.” For me, though, I was seeing someone my age on the bridge. Yes, he was stupid at times, but he’s a kid. He’s kind of meant to be. He has remained one of my favorite characters throughout, and I prefer him to a lot of the regular bridge crew. I’ve really never been a Worf or Riker fan - give me Wesley any day."
startrek,feamzdy,t3_eo5tni,1578950420.0,"TNG was my favorite for a while, but as I got further through DS9 I realized it was my favorite and it was just, well, better. It’s since become my favorite Star Trek series by far. Whereas in most of them, I have characters I strongly dislike, that really isn’t the case in this one. I’ve never been a Worf fan, but he’s so much better in DS9 than in TNG and DS9 introduced me to my favorite Star Trek character (love you, Garak) as well as a crew that I love. When I need to cheer up or just want to watch something good, DS9 is always the one I go to. It feels timeless, in a way. When my mother watched it originally, she was able to relate it to issues happening then. When she showed it to me a few years back, I was able to relate it to issues happening now. All in all, it’s so, so good."

Congratulations, I made a reddit account just for this post. My health has been awful these last few years, including near constant nausea that makes it difficult to eat. I was overweight when it started, but I’m not now. I was barely eating for months, and I still am barely eating. I’ve lost 60+ pounds in the last year, and trust me when I say none of it was through exercise because I’m often in so much pain that moving is hard. Do you know one of the reasons I don’t put effort into eating? My father never complimented me until I started losing weight. Almost every time I see him, he compliments my weight loss and acts like my pretty much starving myself is a good weight loss technique. This is what you are setting up for your sister. You are telling her that she only deserves validation when she loses weight, and encouraging unhealthy ways of losing weight. Trust me when I say that losing weight like that is never a blessing. It makes me feel like crap and makes me feel and look sick. It sucks. Apologize."
