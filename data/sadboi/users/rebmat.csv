bipolar,exd1iy2,t1_ewxb5pp,1566164914.0,"Hi! So I started to accept who I was. Started saying, ""I have bipolar"" as opposed to ""I am bipolar""... which helped me feel like I had more of a grasp on it as opposed to it having me. Also, I stopped people pleasing.  I started to say no to things that didn't please me or that I didn't want to do. And... here's the silly part. My sponsor made me look in the mirror, everyday, and say ""I love you"" while looking at myself in the eyes. GAMECHANGER. At first, I couldn't look at myself and I'd mumble it. Now, I honestly feel like I love who I am, flaws and all. I'm made exactly the way I am, and it's about progress, not perfection :)‚ô°
P.s. if nobody's told you yet today, you're doing great and I'm proud of ya."

Hang in there & congratulations‚ô° sending you good vibes!"
