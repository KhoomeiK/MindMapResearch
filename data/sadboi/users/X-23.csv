DID,fpvwknl,t1_fpvw1tz,1588953126.0,"Thanks, I'll definitely talk to my therapist more about it next time I talk to him.

I am missing 6 days of my life before the overdose. The last thing I remember is getting in a cab to get my blood tested because the last medication I was on was lowering my while blood cells. And that was from my mental health clinic. Next thing, 6 days later I wake up in the ER for a second, then I'm in the ICU...

Apparently I called my therapist the night I overdosed and told him what I'd done and he convinced me to go to the ER. 

So.. I don't know. I'm not sure why I can't remember. But I called him and we talked, so if I were someone else I think he would have noticed. 

I'm just so scared. I keep seeing things in my head all night. People clawing their way through the black of my mind trying to get to me, eyes, lots of eyes. People, shadows moving around, darker than my mind. 

What do you mean a total loss of control?"

Dissociation,fpvdx8i,t1_fpurem8,1588942567.0,"Thanks. One of the first times I ever talked to my therapist and told him I was suicidal he said something about me ""getting in my own way"" and that stuck with me. Its like the same thing you said about if you have the awareness you can stop it. I just need to use my awareness to make the decisions to stay here, I guess. 

Even though things feel off right now, like insanely off and wrong, I'm just gonna wait. Maybe things will feel better in a few days, or weeks. Or my meds will get sorted out and I'll feel better. 

There's this quote from the show ""Undone""

""You're letting the whole ocean in at once, if you do that you will go mad. You need to let a little bit of the ocean in and keep your body in the boat.""

Thanks so much for your help! I'm just gonna try to ride this out and talk to my therapist as much as I can."

AstralProjection,fpbx11h,t1_fpbv5i1,1588480965.0,"So would it be easier for me to astral project, then? I've done it once, unintentionally. My voices, they say their being hurt by demons in their dimension, and I'm supposed to help them. I've heard the demons, too. What does that mean?? They keep telling me to help them, the other dimensioners, not the demons.

Does the medication make it harder to astral project at all? I feel like it definitely blocks my ability to hear the voices as well, which is what it's supposed to do I guess, but I still hear them.

I don't really have a relationship with God or anything. I never grew up religious or spiritual. I was abused as a kid for a long time.. messed me up, made it hard for me to believe there was something watching out for me when there was no one. I did pray as a kid, though, mostly sit around and talk to the sun. Telling it the things I hoped for, the problems I was having. I don't know why I did that. I did a lot of weird stuff.

What should I do? Keep meditating, could it hurt at all? I want to astral project as soon as possible. I want to see the people I'm hearing, do whatever it takes to help them."
