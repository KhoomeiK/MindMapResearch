The absolute LAST thing you need added to your plate when dealing with Bipolar Disorder is additional stress. 

I came across your post as I have been DESPERATELY trying to find venues where my sister might get help herself - as she is uninsured, and to date the help she was getting has not helped and after losing both our parents in the last year and a half she is having CONSTANT Panic Attacks, shaking, NOT SLEEPING ,(which actually led to a 4 day hospitalization due to Hallucinations), VERY barely eating, and depressed on and off. The first 3 symptoms are EXTREME and of MOST concern and I am at my wittes end trying to find some way to get her free help. Much as I hate to ask with ALL YOU HAVE TO ENDURE, I would be much obliged if you could offer any suggestions."
