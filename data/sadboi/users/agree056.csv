Anxiety,fmswf3v,t1_fmpabhe,1586363054.0,My favorite thing is when someone in my life tells me to â€œstop overthinking â€œ if I express my feelings or thoughts. Like yeah ok why didnâ€™t I think of that Iâ€™ll just stop so simple. What they donâ€™t understand is when they say that I just start overthinking about their comment to stop overthinking and feel guilty like Iâ€™m a burden to them. Anxiety is so much fun ðŸ˜”
