Then one day he did act upon it and it destroyed my life. He went to therapy and did all the CBT, DBT and other shit. But yet he still acted on his attraction, his urges and because of that he traumatized me. Comparing a sicko to a suicidal person is NOT the same.

Xanax and Ativan have short half lives: they work fast and work for short amount of time. Good for occasional, as needed use (you feel anxious and take one)
Klonopin takes longer to work but the effects last longer than Xanax or Ativan. Great if you are going to take it on a scheduled twice a day basis as there will be a steady stream of the drug in the system. Also you can be on the others long term too, just will have more breakthrough anxiety."

My first panic attack was 34 years ago- I was 7 and it was from my mom using ammonia cleaner (like she did every day) on the floor. Something in my brain flipped and I felt like I was dying from the smell. I did good for a decade or so as an adult then one day, BAM! I started having panic attacks that rolled for hours and severe anxiety 24/7. I thought I was dying every minute of every day (convinces I was having a heart attack or a stroke or a DVT) I couldn’t function at all: became an agoraphobic and didn’t leave my house for months, developed numerous severe phobias, and started pulling all my eyelashes out.

Being busy 60 hours a week doesn’t leave much time for self care but you should definitely make some time for that! Mediation has been very helpful for my anxiety ( the app called Calm is great) and going to a DBT group has helped tremendously for my anxiety, too. I try to spend at least 10 minutes a day in nature and also use a lavender essential oil roll on on the wrists it has helped me stay grounded throughout the day.

Then one day I realized that NOT working out was more dangerous for my heart than getting my heart rate up there. I made sure I ate a good, healthy breakfast that included a banana and then I exercised every day: slowly increasing the duration and intensity over a couple of weeks- more for me to learn to tolerate the sensations of my heart rate accelerating than anything else. I’m not a doctor but I do believe with your age and the tests that they have run on your heart, you should be just fine exercising and should have to worry about any adverse heart affects."

Doctors have told me that mine will go away and to be honest, they have disappeared for chunks of time but they always reappear at some point. I remember that they didn’t happen for almost a year at one point but then they came back lol. I also cut out caffeine and alcohol and make sure I am hydrated well. I can’t say for sure if yours will go away or not but I can tell you that being anxious about them can make them feel worse. I’d tell you not to worry but I know that’s easier said than done."
Anxiety,fj8rzjm,t3_fc5vbh,1583120689.0,"I’m NAD but I have anxiety and panic disorder (first panic attack @ 7) I’ve been dealing with it for 34 years now. I also have heart palpitations... mine are PACs which are premature atrial contractions (the extra heartbeats happen in the upper two chambers of my heart). I have had these for years and they coincide with my anxiety. I have learned that when I am anxious they happen more frequently. Also, they happen for absolutely no reason and are a mostly benign arrhythmia. The bummer of having anxiety/ panic AND heart palpitations are that they feed off each other. Someone who is anxious and or has panic attacks is going to pay way more attention to their body and how it feels and will notice every heart palpitation and then the anxiety/panic gets set off. I have seen some of the best cardiologists at the MPLS Heart Institute and had many tests done- 7 day holter monitor, 30 day event monitor and echocardiogram. All of my tests came back sinus tachycardia with SVT episodes and PACs. I hate having the palpitations but have learned to be less afraid of them as I have been reassured that they can’t hurt me. It sounds like you are doing things right by exercising and staying hydrated. I hope that you find the reassurance that you need at your next appointment! Good luck!"
