TheWitcherLore,fp72zov,t3_gb5mym,1588363105.0,"I do agree, definitely play the games. The Witcher 3 looks incredible and if you do have a lot of time you can easily spend 150-200+ hours on it. There's so much to do plus it has really good dlcs. I haven't played the first game both because it's only available on pc and because I was told it was really outdated. If you like RPGs you'll definitely enjoy playing."

It took me a long time to learn to do that and I'm still learning but every step forward helps. For me meditation helped and basically just reading up about what can help when you feel like you are drowning. I started with just few minutes of meditation a day but giving yourself that time even though it is only few minutes can help. I don't meditate every day like I probably should haha, but doing at at least once in a while has helped me change my internal dialogue little by little. 
I hope this is a little bit helpful and not just me rambling lol ‚ù§Ô∏è"

It's understandable to breakdown, specially when you are working on the frontline. You are doing a great job and I hope people will truly appreciate the sacrifices you are making, I know I do. It's ok to break down, don't be afraid to seek support to help build yourself, it's important to know that you don't have to be alone in this. I wish you all the best. ‚ù§Ô∏è
All the love to you‚ù§Ô∏è"

I think it would do most people good to watch that show. It has so many topics that a lot of people never even think about. I was so lost for word after finishing it... Just wow

All the love"
