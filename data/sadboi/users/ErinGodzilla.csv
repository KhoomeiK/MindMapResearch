The pigment has really seemed to go away in some places.  Apparently this is normal?  The chart she gave me listed that as what happens day 9/10 (then comes back later???) but I  saw it day 3-4. I dunno.. thinking I may need more than one touch-up off the bat as I read more and more.  Thank you for your reply."

I'm concerned about pigment and pigment layering because my color looks a lot lighter than a lot of after photos I've seen for the look I want.

microblading,fqm1476,t1_fqlv9vc,1589469685.0,"This is very reassuring, thank you.  I'm trying to not think about it because I know it will look different in a week.

She did the shape while laying down but we both looked at it multiple times while sitting up after the first few passes.  The problem is she did the arch very round at first and then when she went to make it more angular I think that's where the height came from.

I will definitely at least talk to her about it and try to figure out my options once it's healed.  Thanks."
microblading,fqlujq6,t1_fqlu9u5,1589466333.0,"Yeah she trimmed them quite a bit too, so I know it'll look a little better as it grows out a bit.  Thanks.."
microblading,fqlryaa,t1_fqlqp1g,1589464927.0,So you think trying again over it with a better color is futile?  I've resigned myself to now having to use a lot of concealer and filling my brows anyway for the next weeks/months as it is.
microblading,fqlpbcm,t3_gjmda5,1589463444.0,"So I think the color is waaaay too warm.  My natural hair is ashy med/dark brown and my eyebrows are even darker naturally.  I bleach my hair but the professional agreed we needed to go ashy and dark based on my roots/brow color.  She said my brows are almost black.  How is this what we ended up with?  Mixed ash blond w dark brown.  Should've mixed gray I think. Maybe even a drop of black.

Also, the eyebrow on the right I feel is a little too high.  :(

Now I know it will lighten as it heals (the color already looks way off from what I want/need) and I have a touch up in July. 

My question is:  is there anything I can to do speed up getting rid of the pigment that's too high on the one brow?  Any recommendations on the touch up?

I plan to bring the brow pencil color I normally use and fill my brows how I normally would before the appointment instead of going in bare faced like I did this time.

I'm just so disappointed right now.

ETA I did bring up the color being too warm last night after the first few passes but wasn't sure if it was just redness.
