from my fb: “i’m expected to make a full neurological recovery in 12 months, but i’ll be less tired and feeling a lot better by month 3 (january)! my double vision from my eyes crossing is gone but my left eye is still a little blurry but they said that should go away. i got  3 hour long rounds of gamma knife radiation by a world renown expert at it at an amazing cancer hospital to get out any microscopic pieces, i can drive depending on my eyes and start drinking 😜 in 3 months. the only down side is that my doctor, the head of this hospital’s brain tumor dept, will be aggressively watching Harold for the next 5-7 years with monthly then yearly MRIs and i’ll voluntarily be getting MRIs every couple of years for the rest of my life since my symptoms didn’t show up for a long time. He calculated that Harold started growing at least 4 years ago but that’s not super accurate bc they don’t know a lot about my kind of meningioma, atypical grade 2. I didn’t have symptoms until august which blew all my Dr’s minds, i should have been having seizures with the size of it and how bad my brain swelling was but i’ve never had one!!!! the sad news is that I have a 50% chance of Harold coming back, but he could be a completely benign grade 1 that doesn’t grow and could be radiated out, but could be in a different spot but still always on the outside of my brain! these things won’t spread to my body and only 0.8% of them are actually malignant grade 3. i am only of the unlucky 2,400 americans a year to get this kind of growth ://"
