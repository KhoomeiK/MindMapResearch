StonerProTips,fp6apu1,t1_fp58xkb,1588349094.0,I always used to keep a nickel in my grinder. I also had a really high quality grinder. It was a called a phonecian. It was like $70 bucks but it was SO much nicer to use. The screen had slightly bigger holes so I got a ton of kief. And it was twist lock so you never had to worry about cross threading it while high.

MMJ,flnwl1u,t1_flnwaer,1585327248.0,Fair enough. Yeah I haven’t personally been to the 1 medical store they have in my whole state. But people I’ve talked to say it’s outrageous. I can get 1 gram distillate carts for $40 from my plug and they are like $60-70 for a 1 gram cart at the dispensary. Even the recreational dispensary in Nevada had them for like $55. It’s a joke here really. They even tried to make people buy their bud in blister packs.
MMJ,flnvphi,t1_flnvis2,1585326770.0,Yeah they made medical legal here in UT but it’s cheaper to drive to Nevada and buy recreational. They also have some dumbass laws on the books where you’re not allowed to combust the weed. And you can’t grow your own. I’m seriously contemplating moving to a legal state

I still think people having possession charges shouldn’t keep them from finding work in the MMJ industry though. You’d think those are the people who’d be better at it.
