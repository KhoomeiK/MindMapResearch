depression,ffgx81g,t3_enrs4c,1579917372.0,"I feel this way every time I end up talking about it. I have a very hard time masking my emotions, which is super frustrating, because my depression shows all over my face and body language (except for when I’m at work). People will ask me what’s wrong and I just feel like I’m whining if I am honest, so I almost always end up saying “nothing” and trying to leave it at that. My partner is a very “fix it” oriented guy, so the “nothing” response really gets to him, but it is subconsciously my default answer every time I’m in the deepest states of my depression."
birthcontrol,ff8s4de,t1_ff8roqg,1579693929.0,"Correct, you can’t undo it now. But you didn’t know all of this before getting it, so it’s nothing to feel bad about. These things I’m telling you are important and I’ve learned that when it comes to birth control especially, no doctor or even GP is 100% honest about the negative side effects of these medications. If they were, people wouldn’t be so keen as to jump right in on taking them, and they would lose money. It’s bad for business for them to be completely honest. It’s important with birth control to do a lot of your own research, read forums, or like you’re doing now - ask the people who have experience using it. Keep in mind that your experience may be different and more positive than mine, but there are a lot of cases of women who are very negatively effected by different kinds of birth control, and it’s not talked about in the doctor’s office, like it should be."
birthcontrol,ff8rest,t3_es9s0i,1579693055.0,"A couple of things. I got on Depo about three years ago because my periods have been very severe all of my life. My partner is a paramedic, so he was able to administer the shots at home, making it much more cost effective. 

Within a few months, I gained about forty pounds. I had insane mood swings, I cried multiple times a day, every day, and at this point I’m thankful our relationship survived. I was completely different before getting on Depo - I was a chill person, optimistic, and had more stable mood. I was on it for a year before I had no choice but to stop taking it, to save myself and save our relationship. 

Within one year after stopping Depo, I got a 6cm cyst on my right ovary. I had NEVER had ovarian cysts that size in my life, and to my knowledge never any ovarian cysts at all. I ended up with a $14,000 hospital bill for going in to the ER in the middle of the night and having ultrasounds done (luckily it was forgiven because I don’t have insurance and the hospital offered a “low-income” repayment forgiveness program). To this day, over a year later, I have pain I that ovary and pelvic area when I ovulate. After thorough research on my current symptoms, I’m convinced that the Depo has caused me to have a mild case of PCOS. I did a good search a couple weeks ago - there are several women who feel the SAME WAY. I’ve also never been able to lose all of the weight I gained while I was on Depo. That’s not accounting for the long-term negative effects of the shot (if you keep getting it). 

My point is: your OB-GYN is being reckless by prescribing you Depo because of your weight gain issue on YAZ, and I do not think Depo is a good choice for ANY woman, even if it works for some, because the side effects of long-term use can be pretty severe (and anyone taking it can get them). It sounds to me like they are just trying to throw different types of BC at you and hoping that something sticks, without considering the side effects. I know based off of a couple visits the my OB-GYN at the time didn’t care about me as a person - all she saw was a patient on paper and that I wasn’t pregnant (therefore not making them more money and not truly important). She had a terrible beside manner and didn’t inform me past the basics of how often I’d have to take the shot and that it should stop my painful periods (which it did, but I’d rather be in physical terrible pain for a week every month than mental anguish every day)."

I have a XR and a Galaxy S10e. The S10e hands down beats even my XR at nearly everything - camera, screen, customization, and especially SIGNAL. Every time I switch back to my XR at my home (extremely rural w/ a cellspot to aid with coverage), my XR loses signal constantly throughout the day. From 3 bars to 0. My S10e NEVER loses signal here. Almost full bars at all times, and it has signal on many of the super weak spots from here to my work. 

Until Apple moves back to Qualcomm modems for all of their devices, I wouldn't get another iPhone unless you buy it SIM unlocked directly from Apple."

I live out in the country where I get two bars of signal as best, so I have a signal booster which gets me fill bars at all times on my s10e, never cuts out. I upgraded to the iPhone 11 once I paid my 8 Plus off, and since I started using it, I noticed two bars of signal max, and my connection would drop in and out throughout the day. Maybe 2-3 times. Every time I make a phone call using only LTE/VoLTE the call is broken up and ultimately disconnects. It won't make 4G for voice calls at all, the signal immediately drops out when a 4G only voice call is initiated. 

I'm very disappointed, but it's also on me because I knew Apple used Intel modems again this year, and I upgraded anyway. With my Galaxy s10e having zero signal issues, I think it's safe to say it's not the service, it's the phone's shitty antenna, and it's beyond frustrating that Apple sticks with it even though it causes reception issues. Obviously if you have perfect coverage where you live, you'll experience this a lot less, but if my Galaxy s10e can do it with no problem, a brand new iPhone should perform just as well."
