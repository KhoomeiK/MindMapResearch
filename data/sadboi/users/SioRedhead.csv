For one thing, everyone is different and likes different things, so communication and the ability to talk about what feels right and what doesn’t, without fear of damaging someone’s ego, is really important. There are medical and physical reasons some women don’t orgasm from penetration or maybe at all. Orgasms are just one part of sex, (albeit, a great part) and pressure to reach a finish line for the sake of ego or accomplishment can really put a damper on the whole mood..."
AskReddit,fjzytwr,t1_fjzwwgn,1583734311.0,"I was saying “men who don’t enjoy anal” not that all men don’t, obviously many men enjoy anal penetration.

I think the same is true for women, but penetration is more of an expected part of sex for straight women then it is for straight men. I think most people probably can orgasm from many many things that they don’t typically enjoy doing, but the head space your in, the individual relationship and context can influence what you enjoy, and what you don’t."
TwoXChromosomes,fjzydsy,t3_ffp1zk,1583733807.0,"I am not Muslim, and I don’t know a whole lot about the choice to wear the hijab. It would be great if society placed the responsibility on those who express predatory behavior, and demanded better, instead of laying the responsibility on their would be victims. Especially since women who choose to wear hijabs still get sexually harassed and assaulted. Fat women, old women, “ugly” women, and men too- no one is “safe” from the predatory behaviors, or the fear and threat of harassment. 

It was never about what you wore. Clothing does not cause rape, rapists do. 

But I can understand the appeal of a layer of protection.

And as far as I can tell, the hijab is not oppressive in and of itself- there are those who use it as a tool of oppression, but without hijabs, those systems of oppression would still be very much in place. People who assume that the hijab is a form of male oppression forced on women, are often those who have some internalized Islam-a-phobia and are basically using it as an excuse for enacting white oppression on Muslims. And that’s not better, people. 


I hope that whatever you choose, whether to wear the hijab, or not to, that you do it from your own conviction- that you choose what feels right for you, and not because of the actions or influence of any other person. 

You can be a good Muslim without a hijab, you can be a good liberal with a hijab. And no matter what, other people are going to tell you that you should make different choices. Haters gonna hate , you’ll never please everyone. So you might as well please yourself."

It’s totally fair to look around the bopo community and notice how the people with the most visibility are still, white, conventionally attractive, able bodied and so on. Privilege is intersectional, and pretty-privilege is real. Just like thin or white or male privilege. But I think at its heart, body positivity is a movement that proclaims that worth is intrinsic, and psychical beauty of any kind is not the currency you owe the world for existence.  

It takes a while for an adjective to be destigmatized. It’s still pretty common for someone to respond “no your not” to the phrase “I’m kind of fat!”. But I can be kind of fat and cool with it.

When women, and all people, compliment each other, it’s a beautiful thing. We should build each other up, support each other. We do not need petty, self deprecating comparisons in response to kind words. All we need is more kind words. 

I taught myself to respond to compliments with a “thank you” and a smile, even though sometimes I don’t agree, even though sometimes it pisses people off. Actually pissing people off is kind of a plus.

It sucks that you feel insecure, it sucks that your man revealed an opposing preference in such a careless way.

If this was build a boy workshop, would you make your ideal physical partner to look exactly like he does now? 
Maybe you would, but, I know at least one thing you would change about him if you could (his weird aversion to the fact that gravity exists and do what it do to the human body). That doesn’t mean you don’t love and want him, exactly as he is. It just means, people are people. You weren’t engineered in a lab to please each other, you are living breathing beings who will clash sometimes, but that doesn’t mean you aren’t still as perfect for each other as you need to be. 

And if seeing other women’s boobs makes you uncomfortable, I hope you don’t have to, you can unfollow pages that aren’t your scene, it doesn’t mean you aren’t pro body positivity.

It was in a converted house, so our private entrance was a hallway. There was a really nice Mexican family in the other unit, and then our landlords lived in the rest of the house. The land lords creeped me out a little bit. 

So the hallway had a motion sensor light that was really really hard to activate. There was an outer door, then about 20 feet, and the door to our apartment. You could often get all the way to our door without activating it, so usually we’d like, wave our arms over our head as we went through. There was 1 other door into the hallway, that I believe connected to the landlords house, but it was always locked and blocked by a bunch of storage stuff, because there wasn’t anything else there, just our door. We always locked the door to the outside, and the door to the apartment, with a dead bolt. 

From where I slept, I could see the dead bolt in when it was locked down in the door jam, and I remember kind of staring at it as I was falling asleep that night.


So I’m falling asleep and all of a sudden I jerk awake, and I don’t know why. And I feel this sensation of fear, but I ignore it and I just try to go back to sleep. I’m almost asleep again when all of a sudden I jerk awake, and I’m staring at the door to our hallway And I can see a bright red eye staring at me through the keyhole. By this point I am both paralyzed with fear and full of adrenaline, so I know the red eye part is 100% my imagination. And then I realized the door I s open a crack, so I’m laying there remembering it being locked just minutes ago, feeling so creeped out, and the light in the hallway clicks on. So finally I’m like, ok, this is malarkey, and I bolt out of bed and throw open the door and there’s still all of the stuff in the hallway and the door to the outside is locked, and I lock the inner door and go wake up my roommates because I was so freaked out. My roommate confirmed that she had locked both doors that night. And I remember seeing it closed as I was going to sleep. I don’t know how it unlocked, opened, or how the light came on. 

It freaked me out so bad that I checked the next day, to see if I was possible to see through the keyhole at all. It wasn’t.

Long nails might make it harder to hold an axe. But being a woman also makes it harder to live in a society that trivializes everything about your gender and identity. We carry on tho. And I don’t always wear acrylic nails while I chop wood. And I don’t always chop wood while I wear my acrylic nails. But I assure you, it is possible to do both. You are wrong.

They get cranky and mean, they can’t think about anything but food they “aren’t allowed to eat” and any weight loss that happens is either kind of scary, or immediately reversed and more gained. Then, when I got to college and learned about eating disorders, evolutionary biology,  the scarcity principle, I just became convinced that our bodies are not built to shrink. If you restrict calories to the point of weight loss, it sends your body into starvation mode, which kills your metabolism, saps your energy and can cause permanent damage to your liver, heart, bones, not to mention mental health. For me, being anti diet is such a pragmatic and logical decision. Diets cause agony, don’t work, or trigger a chain reaction of negativity. Diet culture contributes to bullying and suffering, and once you see it, you can see how the companies that are advertising diet products to you have absolutely nothing to gain from your well being, but everything to gain from your dissatisfaction."

It turns out, she didn’t fall in love with a woman, she fell in love with a man who just hadn’t transitioned yet. I wonder if that’s hard on her. I wonder if she had to re-examine what she thought was true again, just like I saw her have to do when she fell in love with someone everyone saw as a woman.

sexuality,f8uvk5y,t3_e28frl,1574846519.0,"For what it’s worth, it doesn’t sound fucked up at all to me. Sexuality is. Society puts boundary’s and labels and stuff on it, but the way you are is always valid. What’s fucked up is that you feel shame over something that is simply a realty for you. You are completely allowed to be in a loving relationship with your man, but also want something sexual with a woman (or women) 

However, it’s important that you figure out what you and your partner are comfortable with, and communication is key to that. Sexual monogamy isn’t the only way to love someone, and if you feel like you are missing out on something without a female presence in your sex life, that’s an important thing to communicate to your current partner. This isn’t something you can simply repress, and if you don’t embrace it, it’s more likely to come out in unhealthy ways instead. 

I would bet many (if not most) men would be able to be persuaded to be open to being in a relationship with a woman who has sex with other women. And if sex with women and relationships with men is what you’re into, it may be frustrating and impractical to be in a relationship with any man who isn’t woke enough to understand and accept that part of you."

I think there might be one or two places this could be tighter,(eg below) but I can also see how the slight deviations are a part of the structure.

I think you could drop the word “that” and it would be just, tighter. ]

Also, I totally get that the repetition of “godforsaken” is purposeful, but, it feels a little on-the-nose.  I don’t know. With all the religious imagery, I feel like alluding to it, rather then saying it might be more meaningful? But, I could also be wrong."

I spent the first couple of months feeling lonely and homesick in a way I wasn’t expecting, and then I got to be friends with everyone else in the program, and then the friendships started to lose their shiny newness, but hadn’t settled into comfy closeness. And that was in a way, even lonelier. But then, I started hanging out with this one person I had totally dismissed at first. When I met her, I actually thought the literal sentence “there is absolutely no good reason to talk to this person”. She is one of my close friends (when I see her, we keep in touch 0% and she lives in Hong Kong rn) and she was my favorite friend out of the bunch, and I was not expecting it. 

I think it’s really healthy to realize that the people you’re hanging out with might not be as important to you as you initially thought. That doesn’t mean you can’t hang, it just means, don’t bend over backwards to hang out with them if you aren’t really into the friendship. And don’t discount people as potential friends. Don’t let your perceptions of age, status, weirdness or whatever prevent you from finding your people. A lot of my super close friends are people I initially didn’t notice, or thought were kind of weird or boring.

Thought her poems were dumb, because on the surface, they lacked the flowery over the top language one typically associates with poetry. 

The sentence means, Critics thought Emily Dickinsons poems were too simple, and that reflected a lack of intelligence on her part, and a lack of depth. (#sexist) 

Actually, Emily Dickinson was crafting poetry that was beautiful because of its simplicity. Flowery language is often used in poetry and it can lead to poems that are cringe-y and forgettable. 

It is a tricky sentence to read, but it’s helpful to think about the context. Emily Dickinson is a poet you have heard of, even if your never read any of her poetry. So she’s probably fairly good. (Hecka good). She was also a woman in history, which means her work was probably not taken particularly seriously. Then you just look for words that mean her poetry was good. If there had been other options that also meant good, you could focus on the word “simpleminded” and “artless” try and find the most opposite of that."
