Besides, the point isn't that ""he couldn't care less"". It's that you were incredibly and unnecessarily rude, confrontational and disrespectful to his mother and used innapropriate language intended to hurt her in front of him.

You're doing jack to help her. You may think you're protecting her, but what you're really doing is sheltering her and teaching her she needs to get better at lying in order to have any freedom.

Those aforementioned friends? One of them had a girlfriend with a pregnancy scare, 3 abusive exes, and has issues with depression. One is planning on moving interstate to live with his brother once he graduates, and has undiagnosed but very bad issues with anxiety- and his brother ran away before he was even 18. Others I'm no longer friends with got into drugs, and one is 16 and living with her 24 year old boyfriend and got fired from 2 places in the last year.

You get the idea. You have to let her have some freedom and do her thing. What you're doing now will just make her more rebellious and better at hiding it, and if she makes a mistake she'll feel like she can't come to you. This is completely counterproductive."
