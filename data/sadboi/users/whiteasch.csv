**Things That Delayed my Recovery:**

1. **Caffeine:** I started drinking caffeine again about 3 months after I started feeling better. Always remember that *anxiety and DP/DR are co-morbid*, and that feeling excessively anxious will put you an inch away from having feeling/thoughts of DP/DR again. Stay away from chemical stimulants of any kind.
2. **Other Drugs:** Alcohol was almost guaranteed to send me into a downward DP/DR spiral for a few days. Marijuana was like opening the gates of hell in my mind. Occasional alcohol is okay for me now, but I have nothing but unpleasant experiences on marijuana now.
3. **Certain Supplements/Nootropics:** Earlier this year, after over over a year without a DP/DR episode, I started experimenting with different nootropics for somewhat insubstantial reasons: I was curious to see if I would find and improvement my mood, mental endurance, verbal fluidity, memory, etc. I experimented with Rhodiola Rosea, both of which mildly increases seratonin levels with regular use. I had two spontaneous, fleeting episodes of DP/DR after 6 weeks of taking Rhodiola daily (as directed), which re-triggered my anxiety and panic. After stopping the supplement, I did not get another DP/DR episode. Do your research before taking supplements and be wary of any which increase seratonin levels. I should note that I have taken 5-HTP (seratonin/melatonin precursor) and GABA, and experienced significant reductions in anxiety and improvements in mood and sleep without any adverse side affects. It seems like seratonin agonists are the issue (for me, at least).

**Major Learned Lessons and Changes in Behavior:**

1. **It’s okay to feel DP/DR (and anything for that matter):** One of the affects of meditating during recovery was that it made me feel okay with feeling DP/DR. I started to recognize the emergence of DP/DR symptoms as a warning bell that I was ignoring my feelings and as an opportunity to give attention/compassion to my experience. Meditation made my mind very “slippery.” Being able to allow DP/DR to be there and not really mind it allowed it to pass through my mind very quickly. I stopped resisting and engaging with it, and began treating it like a rain storm — rain happens and it’s sure to pass.
2. **Obsessive, Compulsive thinking is the fuel of suffering:** Learning to recognize and stop engaging with destructive thoughts was *critical* to recovering from DP/DR, and that skill of awareness that leaked over into every other area of my life. I realized the extent to which I had an internal dialogue that I believed in which didn’t serve my well-being. I stopped engaging with those thoughts, mostly (still an on-going process), and have seen an enormous increase in my capacity for joy as a result.
3. **There is no greater gift than healthy day-to-day consciousness:** This state of consciousness is where gratitude, love, appreciation, friendship, meaning, wonder, awe, beauty, and all of the most beautiful experiences of life are located. I feel enormously grateful for the presence of these emotions, now knowing what its like to be somewhere mentally where they are mostly inaccessible.
4. **Telling the truth is the most healing thing:** I firmly believe that telling the truth is the one thing which leads to healing.
5. **DP/DR is not enlightenment:** This is a very common thing for people with DP/DR to fall into (see part about obsessive compulsive existential thinking). If you do not feel whole, complete, connected, and free of fear & anxiety — that is not enlightenment. If you feel in any way that there is a self, or center of consciousness, trapped inside your head — that is not enlightenment. If you feel your experience is unreal — that is not enlightenment.
6. **DP/DR is a harsh but beautiful gift:** DP/DR presents an opportunity for the development of compassion and understanding like very few other things. If you commit to the road of recovery, you will likely be grateful one day that you had to go through it — should you choose to frame it as an opportunity."
DPDRecoveryStories,fqfxhl2,t3_gip643,1589333646.0," 

1. Exercise/Dance: Exercise got me out of my head and feeling my body. **FEELING YOUR BODY IS ESSENTIAL TO RE-ASSOCIATE**. At first, I felt panicked, anxious, depressed, and the last thing I felt like doing was exercising, but I forced myself to go exercise **anyway** because I had faith that it would help ground me — and it did. I highly recommend doing some sort of group exercise, whether its martial arts, dance (which is amazing for getting you into your body), spin classes, or whatever. I got myself around people and moved with them. I paid attention to this dark, fearful place inside my chest as I moved, and just watched as it grew and shrank in intensity. I committed to exercising 4–5 days a week, no questions asked. It helped tremendously.
2. **Identifying Fear and Becoming Uninterested in the Disorder:**
3. Therapy: I started seeing a therapist three weeks after the traumatic experience which triggered my episode after I woke up in the middle of the night and had a panic attack that was so intense I became afraid I couldn’t stop myself from ending my own life. I was assigned to a LCSW and started seeing her weekly at first, then bi-weekly after a few sessions. Through these sessions, as well as a few important phone calls, I made some major leaps in progress. I found out that nothing was more healing than speaking truthfully to my fears and experience. I started to love crying, in a weird way, because I found that the only way I knew that what I said was true was if I couldn’t stop myself from crying when I said it. In combination with meditation listed above, this got me in touch with my emotions for the first time in my life, and was tremendously healing. It allowed me to see the potential good in the shit storm I was going through.
4. Zen: Zen buddhism became the single most helpful, associative guiding force in my recovery. Part of my DP/DR, like most people, was ridiculously intense obsessive, compulsive thinking about existential things, which only served to fuel the cycle of anxiety, fear, and paranoia which caused panic attacks. I started listening to talks by the Empty Gate Zen Center (can be found on youtube: [Empty Gate Zen Center](https://www.youtube.com/user/emptygatezen)), and they brought me an enormous amount of relief. Zen has a particular emphasis on the uselessness of ideas and thinking, and talks about how attachment to ideas and thinking causes us suffering (which I was experiencing first hand to quite an extraordinary degree). They also have a huge emphasis on “not-knowing” and becoming comfortable with the reality that we will never know the answers to most of life’s biggest questions, and also that we should stop seeking to find non-conceptual answers in our conceptual thinking. With this guidance, I gradually stopped being interested in the topics of my compulsive thinking.

 

**Mental Re-programming:** Part of the larger disorder that is DP/DR is obsessive compulsive thinking about existential things and the disorder itself. This obsessive thinking acts as fuel for the disorder and escalates its symptoms. As long as you are compulsively worrying about DP/DR or thinking obsessively, this is the disorder manifesting itself. For me, the disorder took me near to suicide before I truly realized that I had to choose between the thoughts and my life. You may not be suicidal, but in some sense you are in a similar place. You must choose whether the thoughts of worry/obsession you keep engaging with are more important than recovering. You must ask yourself if you truly believe that worrying is going to get you better. You have to be willing to recognize the compulsion/desire to worry and think obsessively when it arises and refuse to engage with it. Here’s what worked for me:

1. In short, I became willing to let go of the thoughts and questions that I had. I had enough of the panic attacks, the constant anxiety, and the fear. I was at the end of my rope of suffering because of my thinking. I realized, and I mean really realized, that these thoughts I was obsessing about were unhelpful and almost entirely unanswerable. There is a short parable in Buddhism which served as the final nail in the coffin in terms of my interest in my OCD thoughts. It’s the parable of the arrow, which I have linked [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Poisoned_Arrow). The gist of the story is that some guy is asking the Buddha all these intense metaphysical questions (things like free will vs. determinism, infinite vs. finite universe, and so on). The Buddha replies by telling him he is like a man who has been shot by a poison arrow, and instead of removing it and proceeding with healing his wound, he lays there with the arrow in his chest exclaiming that he will not remove the arrow until he knows where his archer was from, whether he was tall or short, where the arrow was made, what kind of bow he shot, etc. The Buddha then lets the hammer fall, concluding with something like: just as no answer to your questions about the bow and archer will remove the arrow which will kill you, so too will no answer to whether the universe is finite or infinite relieve your suffering. This story hit me like a ton of bricks when I first heard it, and it actually gave me a true idea to hold in a higher place of value than my OCD thoughts — that idea being that none of the questions was asking/thinking about had answers to begin with and that even if I had an answer, the answer wasn’t ultimately going to help me. Fundamentally, I realized that those thoughts were seriously unhelpful towards my recovery. That realization translated into a practice: every time I became aware that I was interacting with my OCD thoughts, I simply counted down from 3 and upon hitting 1 I redirected my attention to my present experience beyond the thoughts (what am I hearing, tasting, feeling, seeing, and smelling right now? What’s happening in my body right now?), and said out loud or internally that these thoughts were unhelpful. When another thought came up like that, I repeated the process. I was training myself to hold my present experience as being more important than my thoughts. I repeated this process for months. After a few months, and in conjunction with the meditation practice listed above, I started to have several consecutive days without any DP/DR. Then, I had weeks without DP/DR. After 8 months, I went 3 weeks without having an episode. Now, some 30 months down the line, I no longer have significant DP/DR episodes at all. I occasionally get some DP/DR feelings, but I just let them go and they never stay for very long. Just FYI, by letting go, I mean that I stopped resisting or engaging those feelings when they arise. My mentality is more that those feelings are just like little rain storms that come through every once and a while — they show up, I acknowledge their presence and allow them to be, they rain for a bit, but they always leave as long as I let them, as long as I refuse to react to them and feed them energy."

I'd had DPDR for 10 years, 24/7. These days I still have some of the fog left, but that's pretty much nothing. My recovery was non-linear and for the first 5-6 years, I didn't even know what I had was called DPDR. Time of recovery depends on a lot of factors and it's individual. I know that my DPDR wouldn't have lasted even 2 months if only I had the support of my family or friends, a good doctor who knows what they're doing, financial security, the books I now have and if external circumstances allowed me to withdraw and recuperate from stress, but - I didn't have any of that, so it took me 10 years.

About your side question, this is a very common problem among almost all kinds of dissociation. Most importantly, it's often **gradual** surrendering to that feeling that leads to recovery. This is a very brief (and insufficient) explanation of what that feeling of catatonia and all DPDR symptoms are:  [https://www.psychotherapynetworker.org/magazine/article/2347/an-interview-with-peter-levine](https://www.psychotherapynetworker.org/magazine/article/2347/an-interview-with-peter-levine)

I highly suggest that you read Levine's ""Waking the Tiger"" and ""In an Unspoken Voice"", since both books deal with DPDR and trauma in great detail and provide exercises developed to get out of that state.Fear (especially fear of one's thoughts, feelings and drives) is one of the things that keeps DPDR in place. The books explain just how beneficial this mechanism is to human life and it lists exercises to get out of it permanently and gradually - this is very important, because it helps establish a neurological equilibrium without producing more fear and possibly sinking even deeper into it.
