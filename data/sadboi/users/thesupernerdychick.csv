raisedbynarcissists,fqju2cc,t1_fqhe5r6,1589415202.0,"This was my nmom with me but with EVERY doctor appointment. It was especially frustrating during my psychiatrist appointments because I would be asked about symptoms I might be experiencing or how I was feeling in general and I would try to talk but she would always cut me off and answer for me. As if she knew anything about what I was feeling. 


She controlled everything even into my adult years
 When my appointments were, what medications I was allowed to take, she wouldn't even let me change doctors if I wasn't comfortable with them because she liked them and thats all that mattered. There was one specific time I went to my psychiatrist and told him that i was just learning to drive and I was having trouble focusing on the road while I was driving (I have adhd). My mom interrupted and said ""oh that's just you having nerves from driving for the first time."" And the doctor took her word instead of listening to the rest of what I had to say."
AskWomen,fqb7h17,t3_ghp4nu,1589231918.0,"So In tenth grade I had this friend (let's call him dylan) who I had been friends with for years because we were in choir together. Well our school had been chosen to host the middle schools all region choir auditions so I signed up to help. Dylan had noticed that I had stayed after school and decided to stay with me. 


We were talking for a while and then one of hia friends (that ill call adrian)  had walked up and joined our conversation. Now this guy was in the varsity choir at our school and one of the top kids in the program by far. I'm not gonna lie, at the time I had a huge crush on him so the fact that he had started talking to me was really exciting. 


The three of us are talking while waiting to be told what to do and I get a bit of confidence and start flirting a bit. I don't remember exactly what I had said but I do remember for some reason Dylan responded with ""yea you take her from the front and ill take her from behind."" 


We kinda fell into an awkward silence after that and I was super embarrassed because that was said in front of the guy I liked (and I was also very shy back then) but I think Adrian kind of laughed it off and shifted to conversation to a different topic."
AskWomen,fpxmybs,t3_gg0zvy,1588985604.0,"So there was this guy that went to my school and worked on campus. I would see him everyday when I went to get food and we would talk and he flirted a bit. The last day of the semester he asked me out but I told him I was already seeing someone and that's where it ended. I ended up hanging out with the guy and his group of friends next semester and the guy turned out to be like a real skeevy type. He always made really inappropriate jokes and at one point he literally kissed me by surprise attack when I was going home (which I had obviously not been ok with). Really creepy guym he ended up dropping out of school halfway through the semester. Needless to say, glad I didn't take that lower up on his offer."

raisedbynarcissists,fos8c4a,t3_g958hl,1588025812.0,Yes I completely agree but has anyone else been through the situation where once you stop talking they start getting more aggressive because they see it as disrespectful to not acknowledge them?

depression,foe1kz4,t3_g6jgq0,1587694237.0,Wow... I didn't realize other people felt like this. I've been struggling so much with my depression lately. Its just been getting worse now that I'm stuck at the house all day with nothing to do. My fiance literally started yelling at me the other day because I had been in upset all day and i wasnt even trying to be happy. I tried explaining to him that I can't just be happy.. i cant just think of happy things like him. I started thinking that maybe he was right and i just wasn't trying hard enough. I decided to look up this subreddit on a whim because today and I'm honestly really glad I did. I'm sitting here crying because for once I don't feel like I'm being overdramatic or negative on purpose.

When she asked what I was doing I told her I had found magical stickers. She asked what I meant and I took one of my washable markers and wrote on it and the color disappeared and i said ""See mommy?Its magic!"""

Fitness,fl4qxrx,t3_fmbs2e,1584819408.0,I'm currently extremely upset. About six weeks ago I broke my wrist so I wasn't able to do any serious  exercising until it was healed. Now I've finally been told by my Orthopedist that I can exercise again all of the gyms are closed. Immensely frustrating.
