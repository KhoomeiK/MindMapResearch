Three of them were babies and the other two only got around five years old. For a child finding them dead or even witnessing how they die is pretty traumatic. 
On the other hand they are generally very sweet animals, when they accept you as part of their gang they lick your hands which is very cute."

Also I work in a fashion store and it amazes me how good my older coworkers are with smalltalk. I always feel so awkward around customers like I'm nice and all but I often don't know how to respond and I feel so weird about it. Also I like to keep personal stuff to myself. As mean as it sounds I'm there to work not to make friends.
Could also just be my anxiety I don't know."
BPD,fk08nzr,t3_ffqk6k,1583747233.0,"Thank you so much for posting here. I'm fairly new to this community and couldn't relate that much to most of the content.
 I guess I am a quiet borderline type since you basically described me. As a kid I was never allowed to express bad feelings like anger or sadness and at 19 I still can't do it. So acting out is something I just do on the inside and it's a horrible feeling.
 I'm jealous of people who can let out their emotions and scream or argue because for me it literally feels like I'm trapped in my body with myself. I'm totally paralysed while at war witg myself inside just waiting for it to be over.
 I'm self aware in the way of me judging every action and thought. I don't really split and my friends told me they would have never guessed that I had borderline because to them I seem 'normal'. But what they don't know is what's going on inside. I never show them how I really feel but as a result I tend to isolate myself a lot and it costs me a lot of friends. It kinda makes me sad but I feel like it's better for myself if I just stay alone. Sorry for the rambling but I just relate so much. 

Honestly I would give you an award but I don't have coins :(

 thank you very much"
Borderline,fjoiwp1,t3_feirss,1583528657.0,Actually that makes a lot of sense. It's easier dealing with things if you know exactly what it is. I think nothing is more frustrating than the unknown to humans so now that you have a name for it you feel better. I'm happy for you that this diagnosis doesn't freak you out or make you angry/sad.
Borderline,fjog20n,t1_fjnsrb5,1583527030.0,"That's the right attitude. I just wanted you too feel better about yourself not invalidate your feelings. I was mad too. I honestly still am but I wanted to cheer at least you up. But honestly I'm no expert and fairly new to this thread, just trying to spread some love and support so yeah... Feel supported :D"
Borderline,fjn1ic9,t3_fe69s4,1583494377.0,"I get that you're angry. I didn't like to hear it either because basically what I found out is that my personality is actually a mental illness. And I was like not all of the criteria fits, like maybe 6/10 . But borderline exists on a spectrum and I know it's hard to accept and I would recommend getting other opinions on your mental health. But I mean isn't it also nice to finally have a name for your suffering? And to be able to relate to a community that offers so much insight and support? Don't be hard on yourself it's normal to be confused and you don't have to identify with this diagnosis at all.

Basically what I'm trying to say is don't go mad about something like this. It's not worth it. I think it's normal to doubt yourself (especially when you have borderline) but you're not a professional psychiatrist or sth so you're not supposed to have an answer for everything and be angry for not being self aware sooner. That's why you're getting help. Take your time to figure this out and take this as an opportunity to get to know yourself better and be proud of yourself when you gain self awareness on sth you didn't see before."
BPD,fjmzcio,t1_fjmso3s,1583491562.0,Right? Like how are you supposed to predict what you're going to do in the future?
BPD,fjmzb8b,t1_fjmy76x,1583491512.0,Same. Like I'm not doing it myself but if I get in a situation like a robbery or sth I would gladly sacrifice myself to rescue others so no one can call me selfish. And I wouldn't mind if somebody killed me whether it's accidentally or on purpose.
BPD,fjmz5yi,t3_fe8cjl,1583491313.0,"I got asked this a lot too. I always answer that in that moment I don't feel like harming myself but I can't talk for myself when I'm triggered. And I'm always suicidal, like it's the first thing that comes to my mind if I feel bad/sad but I wouldn't act out on it. I think it's really hard to evaluate yourself because it depends on the situation. You don't know what's going to happen and what might trigger you. So honestly I feel like this is kind of a hard question to answer. I'm good now but I don't know about the next five seconds/hours/days/months."
BPD,fjgbijc,t3_fda1fr,1583320725.0,I relate but when I get compliments I just get suspicious and feel like people make fun of me. Although it's not just about looks but also about my personality.

NoStupidQuestions,fja7lrb,t3_fc8yk4,1583168024.0,I had a dream in which I died. I thought that was really interesting because I read somewhere that people usually wake up if they die because they don't know what's after death. But I didn't wake up although it hurt like a MF when I was killed. You would think that's enough emotion to wake you.
BorderlinePDisorder,fhnappx,t3_f40pup,1581724223.0,"As someone who has recently been diagnosed this scares me a lot. I have zero experience and I don't know how to comfort you. Maybe you're relieved somebody read your story and actually cares. I can't do more for you and I don't want to be one of those people who tell you to be positive and don't lose hope. That would make me a hypocrite since I'm rather negative. I'm no help in this matter but I just want to let you know that you're heard and I feel for you. I'm just glad suicide is not an option for you. I tried to kill myself once and I can't recommend it. A lot of people will miss you even though you may not believe it. I know you're tired and exhausted but try to be strong just for a little more time for the sake of your loved ones. And if you feel like you can't do it anymore be strong for a little more and more and more time. Sometimes there's nothing else to do. 
I wish you the best."

BorderlinePDisorder,fh3djjw,t1_fh38hwc,1581267765.0,Honestly I'm looking forward to this 'rambling'. For me it is just super interesting and it does make sense. I guess I just have a hard time accepting this cause it just doesn't fit my expectations. Like I'm really hard on myself all the time and if I'm not what I want to be I hate myself so much for it. And this sounds soooo stupid and I know I'm a hypocrite but I'm fine with people having mental disorders and I support them as much as I can but knowing that I myself have problems doesn't fit the image I created for myself. I know I have to accept it but I feel like it would help to see how others cope with it and notice about their behavior. So yes please ramble! :D

AskReddit,f4ut7zz,t3_dlrz06,1571827995.0,"Two times because of impatience: 
I climbed a fence but my trousers got stuck (it was before a soccer match and I was too lazy to walk around the whole field to get to the entrance so my friends and I thought why not climb over the fence?) Anyway I was stuck but didn't want to wait to figure out how to unstuck myself and I was at the top of the fence so I just jumped off. Turns out I got stuck because of a wire that stuck out so basically while I jumped off I cut myself on the leg. Since the match was about to start I didn't have time to treat it so I just put a tissue on to stop the bleeding.

The other time I was in Croatia for vacation and we were at the beach. I decided to go swimming and there where rocks in the water which I then wanted to climb and I got stuck again but just pulled myself up to the top again slicing open my leg about ten centimeters above the other scar.
Wasn't too nice since I had to go back to bandage it and it hurt like hell when it touched the salt water.
So I got a little scar above a bigger scar onn my left leg cause I like climbing things but have no patience (or intelligence).

Also I got one on my cheek because I thought it would be a good idea to reenact the Lion King scene with my pet bunny. My bunny didn't share that opinion.

I got some on my arms from self harm (don't worry I'm ok now)

And the newest is on my right middle finger. I wanted to clean a kitchen knife (it was Christmas Eve and I was cooking with my family) so I got a tissue and cleaned it when I get distracted by something. So I put pressure on the sharp part instead of the sides and didn't realize until it started bleeding.
