ADHD,fmouj2w,t3_fwhsa9,1586268741.0,greetings my friend
ADHD,fmlfpfd,t3_fvsx5f,1586185491.0,i don't want people to feel annoyed and i like giving insight to the conversation that may have been missing without me. I like different perspectives when i read threads so hopefully people enjoy seeing my perspective in threads
melatonin,fm13gqf,t3_fs979x,1585671296.0,"no its fine just if you take too much on a regular basis it can put up your ""tolerance"" to melatonin which means youll need to take more and i dont recommend it. Thats the worst that can happen though"
melatonin,flk9zcn,t3_fp8t5x,1585236920.0,Personally i take 30-40 regularly but dont take too much because it can make your brain produce more melatonin receptors which makes more melatonin less useful
ADHD,fharbvg,t1_fhar518,1581424357.0,oof glad you remembered it

depression,fe4mgpb,t3_enrs4c,1578860871.0,SOO MUCH. I feel like they'll think I'm faking having depression or something so I just try to not talk about it

ADHD,f74orul,t1_f745k1w,1573405806.0,I did it! I finished the essay I had. Thanks bruh
ADHD,f71d21d,t1_f71d0o4,1573339417.0,"Not great, but I got some done at least"
ADHD,f6zfder,t1_f6yw9vb,1573315950.0,Oh fuck I had to go to sleep but didn't get much done
ADHD,f6y730c,t1_f6y70ce,1573269691.0,HEY GO BACK TO WORK I WILL TO AS WELL AND NOT GET DISTRACTED AGAIN IN A FEW SECONDS!

teenagers,f47sda2,t1_f46539v,1571427270.0,But I'm confused for you can think about things and even have object permanence with it
teenagers,f45wcjk,t3_djjh4t,1571398201.0,How the fuck does one live their life with aphantasia what how do you function it's literally impossible to picture
adhd_anxiety,f45w84x,t3_djazw1,1571398062.0,Well guess I'm not alone in this fear
melatonin,f457dpd,t1_f2bkmgw,1571367928.0,"This wasn't directed to me but just want to say, yes, very high doses can be harmful, but only really through side effects like grogginess the next day etc. I take multiple 10 mg tablets because that's what I find helps me, for example I take anywhere from 20-60 mg a night. I don't particularly feel more groggy the next day, probably bc I messed up my melatonin production, but I'm not going to die because I took 60+ mg (tonight I took 60 for example)"
melatonin,f456x88,t1_f3exm2z,1571367591.0,"It is definitely not have a milligram. Even when I first started taking it I took at least 3 mg (1 of the tablets), but now I usually take a few 10 mg tablets, and I know that it's high but I don't think half a mg would affect me even when I didn't take melatonin"
ADHD,f3axt9h,t1_f3axk99,1570795682.0,Haha me too!
insomnia,f38tm4e,t3_dfwpv8,1570739858.0,I know I should do this but I fucking HATE the orange color. Does it really help enough that I should deal with it?
ADHD,f3638gd,t1_f36360o,1570704673.0,Oh yeah that happens a lot too

ADHD,f05km4t,t3_d3rpzc,1568412168.0,"""Oh I'm sitting on it"". That, or I was flipping it and didn't catch it and didn't bother to go get it and now its on the floor and I can't find it"
depression,eqz995y,t3_bzxjgp,1560396027.0,I feel like my friends all put up a front too
ADHD,ep4pv3k,t1_ep4pntr,1559043941.0,"Ok thanks, maybe we're just really unlucky"
depression,ep4psc0,t1_ep2wxa8,1559043907.0,"This is the kinda thing why I will never kill myself. I don't want to contribute to ""suicide culture"" or whatever it is"
depression,ep4pd28,t3_btsyoh,1559043728.0,"Thank you for this. I'm only 12 and sometimes I feel like I don't ""get to say I'm depressed"" because I'm so young, and I'm just being soft. I was really scared to make a post saying I'm only in middle School, but I was really glad people accepted me"
ADHD,ep4oo6i,t1_ep42gtk,1559043420.0,"Is it by chance at all genetic? My mom has told me all the time (and I've seen it first hand) that she's pretty ""sensitive"" too, so just wondering"

ADHD,eolk43f,t3_bs479h,1558672073.0,What's the advice? Please I need it
depression,eokvt02,t1_eokv84w,1558662393.0,They don't have adhd (most of them) and they don't procrastinate. Even if I didn't waste time playing games and watching YouTube I would still not get that much more done anyway because I cant even think when I'm stuck or don't want to do something. This didn't seem to happen for them
depression,eokt1zg,t1_eoks7bj,1558661377.0,"I've tried all of this before. It never works. I'm sorry if I sound like I'm being resistant but I've tried so many ""strategies"" people try to tell me, but they never work. Allot time? Never enough. If I knew how much every assignment would take and allotted it, including my wasted time, I would have to stay up until 3-5 am and not fall asleep before I finished."
depression,eoko8mr,t1_eo9jil5,1558659210.0,"I know exactly what youre talking about with using the motivation from the failure but I still fail so much. It doesnt seem to work for me. I still can't get my work in on time and get terrible grades on things. It was mostly the fact that I wasted time on an assignment that basically did that one for you, and that's because I wasted time and didn't get work done. This happens for almost all of my assignments and makes me feel like complete shit"
depression,eoaj7hm,t1_eoaif9r,1558419330.0,"I actually had a different throwaway and I feel really bad but one of my closest friends found it and so I stopped using it, so that he didn't worry about me. Thank you by the way"
