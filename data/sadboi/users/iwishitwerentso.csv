That's not the right way to be reading the current or any past editions of any diagnostic criteria of behavioral or personality deviations.  There is a lot harm that could potentially be caused here by giving this a myopic and, no offense, uneducated reading. 

By regurgitating this information to people in need of professional care, you could unintentionally be dissuading them from seeking the care they need. The only thing you got correct in your post was the recommendation of seeking help and everything before that should be edited out. 

While teenage years are often filled with many life events that will create wild fluctuations in mood, behavior, and outlook, it is not rwcommended to do so because of how formative these years still continue to be. Combining those events with the commonly observed nature of puberty to be unstable, it makes it difficult, but not impossible, to draw a consistent baseline that would isolate characteristics that would be cause for alarm. 

Sociopaths, just like psychopaths, can and often do know that something isn't right with their behavior.

Your post would seem to suggest that we all follow the same growth and maturity pattern of neurocognitive development during the teen years. And that is just unacceptable. I would suggest return to your source materials and reread them with a more analytical and less prescriptive mindset if you wish to be a force for providing something constructive and positive. 

To the OP, it seems that you already have a system of support around you willing and capable of providing feedback about how well you are or are not confirming to society norms and cues. You will have to rely on those you trust within that network and that of your mental healthcare team if you seek to make the necessary changes to reduce how often and intensely you find yourself in opposition of authority."

Telling someone to just ""be happy"" when they're sad and depressed, or ""be calm"" when they're having anxiety, etc is like telling someone to run the 200m dash with a broken leg in a cast. They (hopefully) wouldn't do this to that person, so why would they expect that of you in a mentally fragile state.

Remind them that medications+therapy are often like a cast and crutches to continue on with the leg metaphor. They help with mobility when the leg is injured and healing, but when the leg is healed, the cast and crutch only impede a full range of motion. 

Please know that altering a medication schedule is not something to be decided on your own or stopped when you just feel better, but should be done according to the direction of a physician. Therapy is not a life sentence, but like getting a mental tune up"

mentalhealth,fjus2dp,t1_fjubixh,1583619667.0,"You're incredibly welcome, but I want to thank you for opening up about this and sharing your experience. 

You inspired me to write this a long post of a reply and to open my heart and share the entirety of what I learned and gathered from my experience as I continue onward towards tomorrow.  

What helps cushions the blow and give me comfort is to have moments like this, when I can share my experiences in hopes that somebody, somewhere considers what I offer to learn, grow, and dodge some easily avoided pain. 

It helps to hurt a bit less when I take on the opportunity of reminding and teaching these lessons to daughters and sons of well loved parents. Some parents arent deserving of it, but yet there are also many who don't get to partake in the beautiful privilege of having well loved kids do these things. 

It's difficult, it's emotional, and sometimes quite painful to begin the process of memorializing them while the person is still alive. It openly confronts us with the realization that one day we will no longer be alive and exist in this same form in this physical realm. But by undertaking this difficult task and confronting the last thing we want to think about it, it can transform into and truly be the last thing we have to think about. 

Memories naturally fade with time and recalling that memory will naturally get fuzzier and more blurred like looking through a fogged mirror, but when we don't wait to put off memorializing someone when they're still able to participate, it's not too late to strengthen the meaning and intent of those memories by their input.

When someone breathes their last breath it's far from them truly being gone, that's only one form that death can take and just being alive doesn't make up all that we are. For as long as there is someone to remember them, they're still here, and that's how those who have died then get live on.

If you think you'll ever have children in the future, think of how you'd want to explain your own father to your child. In that future, you'd want to share with them to reinforce those stories, because it may happen in a world that I can only predict is going to become increasingly more distant from having faith in personal histories. Prepare to give to your child tomorrow by beginning to give your kids today someone to look up to want to emulate and be like someday. Give them a hero, give them your hero. There's no such thing as having too many heros. 

To see pictures, watch the videos, and hear their voices, that not only will be the form of how they are immortalized, but it's evidence that they were real and that they lived. Its a permanent record of all their mannerisms and facets of personality that validates your story proves that they existed, they greatly mattered to somebody, and that they made a difference by living.

My dad was 57 when he passed from complications with his cancer and I'm only 27 now, and another thing I've learned is to know your body and to stay on top of what may be probable in your own future. I think the current odds are the 1 in 3 men will have prostate cancer by the time they're 50, and if we make it to 50, Im sure that those odds will be closer to 1 in 2. They say an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and so I remain hopeful that one day, in the not too distant future, that conversion rate is going to grow and to offer not a pound of cure but a ton.

To anyone reading this in fresh or less recent grief: Just because you won't ever get OVER losing someone doesn't mean you won't get THROUGH losing someone, and I am a true believer that what I shared aids in making that happen."

We like to think of manipulation as a bad thing, but the word is neutral on its face. People are manipulating and confronting each other all the time, and sometimes both people leave better off than they started. 

I would recommend trying to form a healthy and positive worldview and positive view of people as individuals and humanity as a whole. Some people need a little bit of manipulation to get past being in love with the pain they feel more than hope for potentially being relieved by the right side of actions. Find work that you feel good doing, and feel like you're doing good oh, and just focus on that, because people are often too wrapped up in themselves sometimes"

I always avoid describing something in absolutes, promising solutions that see the situation as unsalvageable, or like some who attempt to speak with such unearned authority, confidently assuming malicious intent in others which could just be attributed up to anything else, aka stupidity (see: Hanlons Razor).

People definitely project a lot of their own unprocessed uncomfortable bulshit onto a situation that they see even just a shred of similarity to their own. And that sickens me too.

I'm always open to admitting I'm wrong, but I need to be shown how I'm wrong if I'm ever going to be changing my mind. We should always be open to new information.

Thank you for your post you said what I have been feeling for a long time, and I hope that I'm not part of the problem, but part of a solution. We have to be part of the change we want to see in the world.

Unfortunately I've seen therapists who are just as bad if not worse then what is seen by the most ignorant of armchair experts.
