If she doesn't remember you then you're good. If somewhere in the middle during the gathering or in the future she remembers you somehow, just act like you didn't remember her either since it was years ago. 

""Oh, hey! I remember you now."" 'How do you mean?"" ""Remember X, Y, and Z (I don't think she'll bring up what you brought up if she does than apologies)?"" 

""Oh yeah now I remember haha! Yeah, I remember, I'm sorry that I went no contact with you. (If she remembers you then she probably remembers what happened) . That was kinda a dick move I did. Again, I'm sorry."" 

If she remembers you immediately just say:

""Hey X, how you been? It's been long."" Then she'll say yeah it has been long, etc. I doubt she'd be blunt about what happened.

""Since I've never really gave myself a chance to apologize to you because of (the issue you have between you two), and I guess I was ashamed of myself. I'm sorry I kinda made our friendship grow apart. I hope we can start again."" Than she respond with whatever. I doubt it'd be bad since she's in a group.

This is to make the group gathering less awkward and I suppose to lower any tension and to rekindle the lost friendship. You should do this how you feel comfortable and your friends should be there to support you. It should come from your heart, or can simply not bring it up, if that is easier.

Advice,fp73q1p,t3_gbosds,1588363491.0,"Hmmm, if she refuses the deal, then you must start planning. Use a recorder or video camera and record your encounters with her. Audio should be easy since you can easily conceal it, video if you can find a good hiding spot where she'll never find it. The issue with that is how will you get your recording without her someone noticing pieces of furniture were moved or anything along the lines of that, if she has a keen eye. This also goes for hiding the audio without having it on you. So, my advice is to use audio and make it stay in your pocket or anywhere so it doesn't fall off and hide it somewhere once you're no longer in need of it. That way if she slips up on her wording or physically abuses you the audio should record all of that. Do not let her know you have it even if something were said or done. If you think one piece of audio is good enough, then make sure it's actually good enough. Think of it as quantity over quality, but you can always reverse that if you'd like. What you do with this is up to you.
