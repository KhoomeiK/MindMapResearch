bipolar,fpokam9,t3_gekb9t,1588785927.0,Yeah I keep paying for classes and losing interest in doing the thing once I have all the training. I also Gerry really into a particular subject only to abandon it after a few months
realwitchcraft,foqjgz7,t1_fopfk1y,1587994947.0,That sub seems dead to me. Only one person making daily post for at least the last month and few comments on any of the posts.
realwitchcraft,foqj39e,t1_fopfk1y,1587994712.0,"Well, I'm not looking for it, just come across it in my daily life. I'm not searching for this stuff. It just pops into my feed. I'll check out the sub you mentioned."

realwitchcraft,fonmdzi,t1_fon1k8q,1587922269.0,"No, these people are asking for help and tips. Like coming on reddit or Quora and asking questions is their research. I NEVER see people asking how to contact angels for instance, always newcomers to the practice."
realwitchcraft,fonm426,t1_fom5d01,1587922124.0,It's usually the occult forum I see this. Is there a big difference between occultism and witchcraft? I thought they were kind of related. I also see these questions on Quora.
Divorce,fom841q,t1_flvq4of,1587881114.0,"Mentally ill people deserve love too. It's very different from abuse. If the person refuses to address the illness that's one thing, but someone getting therapy and on meds is a responsible person and could make a great partner. I have bipolar disorder btw so im offended to be compared to an abuser."

It can very quickly become the main fuel that stokes the fire of psychosis of the person has a warped sense of faith."

realwitchcraft,fdpw53b,t3_emltw3,1578642975.0,"I am also going to jump in and say you don't NEED anything but you. 

That being said, white candles are super versatile. Crystals are very personal. My first crystal I loved was moonstone, then sodalite. Pick whatever vibrates with you most. Use herbs that are local because you don't want to contribute to the over harvesting of Palo Santo and white sage. 

Read read and read some more. The more you learn the more your beliefs will evolve and even change. You don't want to invest in a bunch of crystals then discover you are more attuned to essential oils or something. 

Have fun with it most of all. Some moments will be serious but it needs to stay joyous."

In my time on earth I have found that people are capable of evil beyond what I can imagine. I chose to guard myself against evil I cannot imagine. If I can look at my altar and draw power, someone can look at a picture of my altar and also draw power."

bipolar,f95y6yt,t3_e3ko8k,1575137105.0,I take it every night to prevent mania. I don't think I need it daily tho. It caused me to gain weight by slowing my metabolism and increasing my appetite. This is good for me because I'm on the thin side. It is sedative when I first start taking it but I adjust quickly.

occult,f7dnjib,t1_f7d4lwc,1573622337.0,"As someone who has been psychotic more than once from serious mental illness I feel qualified to object. When in the midst of a delusion, everything seems to make sense. There are real reasons behind your actions, rooted in reality and familiarity. But other stuff is beyond you and if you happen to grow up Christian, you would feel honored if you thought God was talking to you. 

Psychosis is basically believing stuff that isn't present in this reality and acting on those beliefs, causing problems and infringing on others rights in this reality. 

I'm on the fence about whether that stuff is fake (hallucinations) or just too hard to explain. It certainly feels true and makes sense when I'm in my psychosis. 

We not looking to be excused but extenuating circumstances do exist."

bipolar,f6rkixv,t3_dsqt8i,1573107542.0,My brother was murdered but something like schizophrenia had taken him long before that. He didn't want to get help. I miss him terribly. It feels like suicide when you refuse meds and end up in mess because you're psychotic. I'm sorry for your loss. I used to want to be like him so bad. Wore his dirty clothes to school the next day. Now I just remember him. He looks all tough and nonchalant like my brother. Prayers in honor of all the lives lost to mental illness.

bipolar,f4oq175,t3_dl63a0,1571705731.0,"I obsess over food and eating as healthily as possible, but it's expensive and I'm used to eating very rich foods from working in restaurants. I rarely if ever eat breakfast because if I do, I'm hungry all day long and have to eat every two hours or so. My shifts aren't long, about 5 or 6 hours at a time, but with the commute, it will be almost 10 hours between meals sometimes. I think it's my industry tho, you don't get a lunch break as a bartender. 

I think obsessing is a bipolar trait and can spill over into many areas, including your eating habits."

bipolar,f23yb2a,t3_dbqpwy,1569940631.0,"Yeah someone on here got me thinking about how I obsess over a new career path and caress am idea to death without actually taking any real action towards achieving the goal. I wanted to be a makeup artist, jewelry maker, seamstress, sommelier, etc. I spend all this money training and lose interest as soon as I get a taste of what the work is really like. Some how I manage to inform myself of all the flashy points of a position and completely miss the hard parts, the challenging aspects. 

It really is a burden and only recently have I connected it to my bipolar disorder, all thanks to reddit. Gotta love it but coming here is a blessing for me. Talking to others or just reading your stories, thanks everyone for sharing."

I just can't remember them and want to discontinue so bad but I know I'm not set up for that yet. Once I stabilized my money I'll make some moves to reduce or get off this stuff. I feel like it cuts me off spiritually from the creator which is hard to tolerate.
