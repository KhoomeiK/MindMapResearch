pmolol,eu71s87,t3_cewdrk,1563515221.0,I feel you. Almost relapsed today on week 2 (i think). ðŸ˜­
depression,etzyen7,t3_ce72ml,1563338908.0,"I have a similar problem but it's just that I've been so deep into philosophical, existential crap that I have a damn headache everyday."
depression,etzx3zf,t3_ce7tl7,1563338345.0,An upvote for you for you showing your appreciation. It's not much but it's honest work.
depression,etzwpxz,t3_ce7yh2,1563338190.0,"Well, if you at least you have a sweet, caring, amazing mother, and you sound like you still do love her. You sound concerned about her feelings and everything. Mine keeps on scolding me for every little mistake I make. All I can do is try to not want to die or run away or whatever the hell thought I have in my head."
depression,etzw80u,t3_ce81ec,1563337978.0,"Well, now you're giving me that problem, I don't what the hell else to say besides... ""I feel you, I feel like I live in a damn rock."""
depression,etzvxg1,t3_ce7b74,1563337852.0,Same for me but I accepted it a long time ago... I only have the problem of not being good enough in the things I practice.
depression,etzvlf8,t3_ce6jk8,1563337709.0,"Dude, everyday, somewhere in the back of my head, I wish to meet that old wise man who lived or still lives in misery. Back-and-forth storytelling between us? The dream."
depression,etzuzm5,t3_ce6ty0,1563337452.0,"Trust me, I've been trying to be calm everyday with my parent for 8 years. I know the struggle. Heck, I realized that a few weeks ago, I suicidal thoughts at the age of 6 or 7, if memory serves me right. It's true, almost everything is crap. But then, how in the world are we supposed to see the good if we didn't live in crap? That's besides my point. The fact that you feel that way is completely understandable. Just vent it anywhere. Obviously there are definitely going to be people like my asian parent who are going to say, ""you're just lazy"" but fuck it. Oh, and lack of motivation? Motivation doesn't come to you, man. You make yourself motivated. Learned that the hard way. After 4 years of persistent major depression. What I did was say, ""fuck it, this world is shit but I better not be the piece of shit it is too."" That gave me 3 months of motivation. Now... well, I still have it but I'm struggling hard as hell to be consistent."
depression,etzt3wk,t3_ce6kom,1563336670.0,"Yeah, it's been a bit of a problem. I just hope it doesn't form into some sort of dementia or something like that."
depression,er7q7h2,t1_er7q5iy,1560584280.0,Why does it feel like I am the only one though ;-;
depression,er7ogtf,t3_c0ukh7,1560582987.0,"I can relate to that truly empty feeling. But I experience it in a different way. While I have lost multiple emotions, I also feel weird? It's like I'm watching a film of myself, is what I would describe it."
depression,er59bah,t3_c0h3wd,1560521028.0,All I can say is that I can completely relate to you about your desires.
