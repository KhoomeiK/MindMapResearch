Ask her about her triggers so you can make an effort to avoid triggering her in the future. If you do trigger her on accident, don't take it personally. Sometimes the smallest things can trigger someone with PTSD.

Also, while she does have a mental illness, she should not be allowed to make you feel bad for anything that happens. Try to establish clear boundaries of what is acceptable.

For me, I used hydrogen peroxide and cotton swabs to clean out the cuts in the early stages. Applying once every night to clean it out and then band aids or surgical tape to keep the cuts closed. If you dont keep them closed, the scar will be bigger and take longer to heal.

Then once the cut scabs, DO NOT pick at it. This will only make the scar worse and take longer to heal. Then use small amounts of either petroleum jelly or aloe vera to keep the area moisturized.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wikihow.com/Get-Rid-of-Self-Harm-Scars%3famp=1

Once the scar is fully healed, use Shea Butter or Bio oil if you want them to fade more. Theres plenty of oils out there to make scars fade. Hope this helps."

bmbmbm,foipsnx,t3_g77fjq,1587793189.0,"In bmbmbm, everyone looks at Morgan to cue the 3 + 4 beat before beginning the breakdown on the downbeat of 1.

In Ducter, I've found that either Matt or Greep will fall onto one foot after the first breakdown to signal the stop.

In 953, as well as the leg kick, everyone looks at Morgan again to begin the fast section. ALSO, in the fast breakdown of 953, Morgan isnt following a beat until the song slows down long enough to hear one. You can sometimes see Geordie slowly moving his head to the beat, which Morgan picks up on and starts playing to.

In Near Dt, Mi, the first 2 notes that Matt plays is meant to lay down a beat so everyone can come in together on the 3rd beat. So, I guess that's a cue.

In Talking Heads, Cameron plays this little lick during the drum breakdown, combined with a beat from Morgan that cues the 2nd verse.

I cant think of any other ones. Which is a testament to the chemistry these guys have. Sometimes they dont need cues because theyre so damn synchronized."
