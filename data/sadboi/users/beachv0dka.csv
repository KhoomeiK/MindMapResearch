mentalillness,fr5v0pv,t3_gmm279,1589915124.0,"I went to the same one twice, but my friends have gone to others & it seems as if every place is different to some degree..

However the one I went to, at the moment seemed like hell for obvious reasons, but when I reflect I realize it wasn’t as bad. If you need to go, there’s a reason. 

The nurses I had were really nice. Some patients made it difficult because well, some are worse than others. I have a bad memory of a girls wounds. Don’t wanna explain it. That was probably the worst part that I’ve seen. I ended up meeting my best friend in there too. I really enjoyed the extracurriculars. If you are honest & try to learn, it’s typically not bad. Again, you’re obviously in a bad place when you go so it’s not sunshine & rainbows. It hurts being there. But if you stay positive & honest with yourself & the doctors, the outcome helps.

ESPECIALLY being away from social media. I swear I have wanted to go back just to be distant from the outside world. Sometimes the disconnection from your reality for a bit is the best thing you could do. There’s no judgement in there, everybody is usually very open & caring. I have heard that some places suck in a sense of medication? I didn’t have that experience though. 

Overall, it sucks because there is a very serious reason that had you land there - so you’re obviously not ecstatic. But there are positives to receiving that level of care. Just be honest & try your best to keep positive. Realize that it’s temporary! Everyone is there for their own reasons. When you leave it’s like taking off your bra LOL but when you look back you realize it’s an experience that opened your eyes. 

I wish you the best of luck!"

I think it’s because of my thoughts that made him recommend them. They weren’t just like “let’s drive off the street” they were homicidal. Definitely not okay. Wasn’t desire either it was just intrusive shit. I didn’t think I needed antipsychotics to stop that though & I was right I suppose. I’m definitely not Bipolar I or even close to it. I never asked him because I was quick to decline.

I don’t think I’ll get manic, Ive gotten better over the years. I used to have more angry episodes, screaming & throwing shit. I’ve gotten so much better. I’m very aware too & I’ve never reached even close to full blown mania. I get paranoid that I have but my therapist always reassures me"

I’m bipolar II not 1 so I don’t experience mania. I get hypermania. I control my emotions well in a sense where I’m aware & it never gets to a point where it’s dangerous. But it does suck when it comes to how I react to situations that overwhelm me. But I’m definitely not a threat. 

My brother is 5 years older (25 today! cake day) but isn’t bipolar. He has an impulse disorder, OCD & I think more that he doesn’t talk about because we aren’t really close anymore due to his actions.. Like at all.. He’s kinda, not rational or “normal”.

i understand in a sense. i suppose it is all just perception. it’s not easy because it’s either after the high, you crash & feel hopeless, or you take that & realize that happiness is still within your reach. the feelings your explaining are ones i felt at some point too. feeling like i was a shit person, being bipolar (not sarcastically), unhappy with myself as a whole, & then broken up with.

BPD,fo3e33a,t3_g5fdel,1587485326.0,"i talked to my therapist about something very similar.. i think it might help put things into perspective.

she said the reason we have these impulsive/intruding thoughts, especially towards people we love & care about the most, is because of your brains fight or flight response..

if you have a low self esteem, you typically don’t think you’re worthy of love or that you’re surprised these people are still sticking by your side for so long. naturally, your brain will tell you to leave because it is an “i hurt your before you hurt me”..

i think this will help because it’s not really about trying to change or rationalize your thoughts, this is just a way to analyze them differently. this advice made me feel human again. you have more power than you think! don’t push yourself too much, it’ll cause more stress & aggravate your mind into thinking about it even more. just remember that it’s because these people care & love you a lot & it’s your minds way of saying it’s scared of getting hurt, not because you’re crazy. you’re not at all & you clearly have some good people in your life :)"

to say the least that was the most intense drug i have ever done. i was a smoker for 3 years at this point & naturally woke up the next morning & packed a bowl.. something just didn’t feel right. i tried a few times within two weeks & i don’t know how to explain it besides heightened anxiety & dissociating from my arms? i ended up stopping for three months, started smoking again & it’s either a good time or a panic attack filled with impending doom & looped thoughts. it literally just depends on the day. it’s odd, i don’t quite understand it..
i never once thought doing mdma once would change my brain that much. before mdma, i did lsd about 15 times & shrooms 3 times. those never effected me, if anything i smoked a shit ton on lsd. 
i guess our brains are wired differently & that the drugs interact with our brain differently when it comes to the conclusion of the experience. someone told me that the drug affected the cannabinoid receptors in my brain, permanently most likely :/ but like i said, some days i’m great & others i’m not. i’m just as confused as you are but this seems like a common pattern recently which is just unfortunate.

I completely agree that it depends on the person, intuition & sometimes just the paranoid delusions. I do really like the idea that psychs (specifically LSD) can help you see the true side to someone, especially if that someone is yourself. I wish that was always the case to be honest.

dpdr,fnuprhz,t1_fnuoqnv,1587267952.0,"That is definitely an intense thing to have gone through. I understand a lot when you explain the paranoia & questioning who you are. Don’t be fooled, that is normal when you smoke a lot or get anxiety when you’re high. A coping mechanism I did was rationalize my thoughts. I was addicted to nicotine, & when I got high I wouldn’t hit my juul because I was like “who the fuck am i? i’m addicted to this tiny usb thing really?” & just got paranoid & thought everything I was doing was wrong. However, I turned those thoughts from a negative to a positive. Although I was having paranoia & beating myself up, I realized that well.. Am I wrong? It made me quit nicotine, I’d overthink bad habits or interactions I had that day.. Then I realized, I was sober when I said what I said, I’m just high & the reason it doesn’t make sense atm is because I’m high. I learned to laugh it off. 

Weed is definitely not for everybody & actually triggered my cousins, at the time, dormant psychosis. I just smoked an hour ago & I notice as I’m holding my xbox controller & get engaged in what I’m watching on Youtube, I see my arms & hands & can’t feel them LOL. Like they feel detached. It’s so weird. I don’t have DPDR either but I have had slight experiences of how it feels just not full blown.

Also, highs are different depending on how you smoke it. My highs are more intense with a smaller bong than a huge one. My highs are really chill with a blunt etc. I’m not saying to smoke, but just some info that depending on how you smoke it can really change the high. 

Regardless if you ever wanna touch weed or not, don’t let that experience have this much power over you. You just always have to remind yourself that it was only weed, it is something that wouldn’t physically harm you.(aka OD or a seizure or anything like other drugs do). Also it’s not uncommon nowadays. You’re not alone at all.

In high school, I had a best friend which we will name B... B had a dad that passed away in a drunk driving accident. She had a strong relationship with him & always held his spirit close.

So fast forward. Senior year of high school. We were out for lunch & I drove to a convenient store for food. When we were leaving, the exit is a tiny road & is sometimes hard to see the left hand side. I swear I looked both ways, & before I knew it, the moment I hit the gas there was a huge truck speeding down the road & was about a foot or two away from my car.. It would have hit me directly & killed me. 

I was so convinced that her dad was the reason we lived. If I was hit at all I would have been a goner & I still can’t bare the fact that I could’ve had her go down with me. Fuck it’s still traumatic to this day. We are very blessed to be safe & sound."

There are times where I feel high even though I’m completely sober, last night for example. It’s not severe but I just feel off. I don’t know what causes this though. You’re definitely not alone, & you’re most likely going to come out of this just fine. Weed has just gotten too strong the past year or two & it is causing a lot of people different issues but typically stops once it’s out of their system"

If you wait 6 months it’ll only make it worse, at least that’s from my experience. Even when I do M, if I smoke the day or two after, I’ll feel like I’m rolling again. After a few days I’m fine.

Drugs,fnuiddu,t3_g3vc42,1587262803.0,"Xanax. I will never understand why people do it just to do it... Then again, I am prescribed 0.5mg so I am bias since I only use that low dose for a legit panic attack (rare cases)

I tried a higher dose once & will never grasp the concept of doing drugs just to 1. get arrested or 2. pass out & not remember a thing. 

For me, drugs are used for raves/festivals & then a nice “trip” at home. Psychedelics are spiritual to me & shouldn’t be taken lightly. M is to have fun, dance & feel the happiness I used to feel when I was a child."
mentalillness,fnu072m,t3_g3n5bt,1587251971.0,"just know that you are absolutely not alone in this at all!
my moms boyfriend, who doesn’t have any mental illness, is now experiencing depression & so much anxiety because of this.

i was just as worried as you in the sense where the thoughts running through your head seem more morbid/paranoid. i just recently started having thoughts of suicide, & scary enough, almost homicidal thoughts which is fucking scary. severe, intrusive thoughts.

never feel scared to talk to anyone or even a therapist about this. you’re not going crazy, you’re not alone & this is all most likely induced from high levels of stress / anxiety. find a creative outlet! meditate, experiment with different hobbies, journal your feelings. stay occupied & remember that this is normal with the circumstances the world is in right now.

hang in there! i definitely suggest talking to a therapist or a caregiver you trust. if it wasn’t for my therapy session 2 days ago, i don’t think my thoughts would’ve stopped & that my anxiety wouldn’t go away."

I don’t even need to read the description to say, yes! You absolutely are able to refuse anal if you don’t want to do it!!

A boyfriend that wants to do it should respect the fact that
1. You’ve never actually done it before.
OR
2. You tried & didn’t like it.

My boyfriend does ask if we can try it again because I told him someday, once we are together for over a year, that I am willing to be completely comfortable. I also got lube & a gel that stops the discomfort from anal, but I still have yet to try that. 

Anal, in my opinion,  is something that requires a lot of time & trust. He’s an asshole for not respecting your boundaries! It’s only going to make you not want to try it at some point even more just because of the pressure he’s putting on you. Not only that, but because you’ll be under so much pressure, you won’t be able to relax your muscles which only makes it worse."

Psychonaut,fnswivx,t1_fnse4on,1587230140.0,"this is a rant i’m sorry.

i want to agree that tripping on acid with someone will reveal their true colors.. unfortunately though, there was a time i tripped with my brother (we were super close) & we always had a great ass time. about a year later, he (22) at the time) cheats on his (now ex) fiancé with my 16 year old best friend. ever since he was caught he has never been the same.. he is a pathological liar, is very skilled at manipulating. it makes me cry knowing for 18 years i was so oblivious to who he truly was... i want to feel bad because he is in rehab & trying to get better (he ended up getting addicted to acid, klonopin & alcohol) but i can’t seem to find a way to forgive him or even trust him enough to become close again..

another experience is i tripped w my close friend, A. we had so much fun. it was great & we danced & laughed & overall it was amazing.. i then found out she has stolen money from me, manipulated other people to get them to beat the shit out of me for something i didn’t do, threatened to slit my throat, consistently calls me off a blocked number to harass me, & is now threatening to hurt not just me but my mom.

i love acid so much & it really has opened me up a lot. it made my relationship with my boyfriend even stronger than it already was. but i just don’t think a drug is a miracle worker that will open doorways to everyone’s true side."
bipolar,fnrn0yc,t1_fnrlebu,1587194275.0,"i feel like you could help a lot considering i’m 20 & dealing with bipolar for only 2-3 years. i’m still new to this in comparison since it hasn’t acted up until last year.

do you think your experience is how it’ll be for me too? or do people learn / evolve differently due to chemistry & where they land on the bipolar spectrum? i fear that i’ll never feel secure.

i can sometimes determine what’s real & what’s not. when i doubt my feelings/reactions i ask my boyfriend if i’m thinking irrationally & 9/10 he says that i’m reacting normally & that i’m just overthinking my response. basically i’m letting my illness take over my self esteem / confidence & security. it sucks needing reassurance a majority of the time. 

i used to drink & experiment a fuck ton. i stopped drinking a few months ago. i smoke weed almost daily & now i only touch LSD (occasion) coke (rare) & mdma (every few months, my favorite). i don’t think they have interfered but idk. all i know is mdma makes me feel the happiness i haven’t felt since i was like 8 years old. i’ve been hospitalized but not for drugs, however i’m obsessed with the idea of drugs (not heroine, meth, crack, pain killers) & i don’t plan on stopping at all. i know there may be consequences but i’m just hoping i don’t fuck up bad to the point of no return from doing 1 dose of these things every few months"

unpopularopinion,fnrfn3s,t1_fnren0m,1587187513.0,"i completely understand being skeptical about it. unfortunately, as fucked up as it is, it’s become a topic of discussion where girls just lie about being raped for reasons i can’t even think of. 

it is very easy for a victim of assault to get defensive when someone doubts them in any way, because an extremely common “side effect” to rape is feeling like nobody will believe you - which leads the person to question their own sanity. i knew i was not lying, i had bruises to prove it.
i’m sorry if i came off really defensive but it is so stressful when it *feels* like someone will shit on you. 

i moved on even though it left some subconscious emotional scars. i don’t think about it or have flashbacks. there’s definitely some emotion still tied but i refuse to let this worthless piece of shit have this much power over me.

this story is so complicated i wouldn’t even be able to type it all out without missing something. when i talk about it, i either forget some things, or i remember details that i didn’t remember before. that’s why i have all the text messages & made sure to document any evidence & write down everything i remembered hours after it happened"

i tried pressing charges / making sure the guy gets disciplined but hawaii police department fucking sucks. i got a 6 hour rape kit done & then filed a police report. it took the police 4 months to finally get back to me (i had already done a recorded interview a week after the incident) & i had already moved out of hawaii at that point because i had no family & barely felt like a human being anymore. they told me they have “pictures of the suspect” WOW. & apparently i can’t do this process unless i am physically present there. so now it’s a lost cause.

i’m not even just scared for myself anymore, i am terrified at the fact he works with fucking FOREIGN EXCHANGE STUDENTS who range from early ages like 8 all the way to people in their 20’s.. i’m sick to my stomach knowing that i can’t fucking do anything to potentially save another innocent persons life"

i just moved to hawaii at the time & was trying to make friends because i was lonely. i told him i didn’t wanna drink much. he ended up switching our drinks which i didn’t notice until i realized i was obviously more drunk than i should’ve been. & when you’re drunk, you say “fuck it! hand me another drink”.. 


i’d like to add that i was 19, in college & you can only imagine the high someone my age feels to move to hawaii alone. so i was drinking like 2-3 times a week with my coworkers & other friends. drinking with him though was poor judgement on my part... 

i regret ever going to hangout with him because something told me, from the moment he texted me, to not go. i brought my knife too just in case. but the thing is we hung out for a few hours before this went down, so he gained that “trust” just from the fun we had before we drank. he took me to a mountain, the “haunted swing” at the top, we explored. i still have videos from that night. the innocence & happiness in my face is something that i’ll miss forever."

bipolar,fnnt3bi,t1_fnnsh5h,1587100907.0,"Weed gave me panic attacks after I tried pure crystal mdma even though I was a stoner for 3 years. It was New Years of 2019.

Personally I refuse antipsychotics because I do psychedelics & ecstasy when I go to raves  & anti psychotics prevent them from working, & it’s probably dangerous mixing E with that stuff. I  seen people on antipsychotics & they seem to fall asleep a lot. I work full time & go to college full time so I can’t risk that. Hopefully I can find another mood stabilizer.
