Entrepreneur,ey86e21,t3_cw45n5,1566912519.0,"It really makes me so happy to hear you guys are doing well and being appreciated by your local market. My partner and I ran a similar business and whilst the negative customer comments always fucking suck, just remember that you can't be all things to all people, and why would you want to be. Also, people are dicks. End of. We used to find it therapeutic to reply to all reviews bad and good, and with the bad find a fine line between helpful and rude, explaining what you guys do and the reasons behind things. People that want to quibble over price can politely be advised to go elsewhere :)

I was in your wife's shoes for five years and as hard as it is keep those little breaks coming when you can and remember closing for Xmas or a personal event isn't a crime. The business will still be there but there are a few occasions I sacrificed that I can't get back.

The economy needs more business owners and risk takers like you guys who look after staff and are willing to work harder than any 9-5er day in and day out. My experience showed that there was a discerning market out there who want to support independents over any chain, particularly when they can get to know the owners and invest personally in the business.

We regularly visit Scotland so would love to stop by one day! Good luck and keep at it!"
