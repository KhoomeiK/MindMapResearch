But still... Karen's just a name? Boomers have been using the word ""millennial"" as something derogatory yet they get mad over ""boomer"" and ""Karen"" and compare it to racial slurs... That's such a Ka-boom move."

BPD,euah41t,t3_c7kxhu,1563618256.0,"I always struggle with this because I'm never sure if my mother really neglected me emotionally or not. Like, she cares for me, I know she does, but I always feel like my feelings don't really matter to her? She says she wants me to be mentally well and sometimes asks how I'm feeling (on very rare occasions) but I don't really tell her anymore because we have had several conversations about my depression or bpd or whatever (I haven't really been diagnosed with anything because I'm incapable of being consistent with therapy, but it was implied by my last therapist that that might be what is going on) and those conversations always end with her telling me something along the lines of ""well, everyone goes through bad times, you're just overthinking it and being dramatic"". Lately she has been goin on about weightloss surgery (for me. She just made that decision) and when I told her that I do feel bad about my weight but I don't feel like it is the main cause of my problems and more of a symptom, she doesn't listen. I think that is partially why I never talk with anyone too deeply about how I'm feeling and I turn to alcohol, overdosing on prescription medication and self-harm whenever I'm feeling really low. 

It sucks."

AskReddit,erq73v0,t3_c394rh,1561136702.0,"We were a group of three girls. All best friends. I'll call them G and T. G and I had already had problems before, I think our personalities were too different to work long term, and T was supposed to be the one who didn't pick sides because she really cared about both of us.

G and I hadn't been really talking much for months now, not because of anything specific, we had just kind of drifted appart because of our clashing personalities. G had a Halloween party that I wans't invited to (I wouldn't have gone anyways, because I don't like parties, but it kind of stung a bit that she didnt' invite me). Anyways, the day after the party T calls me to ask if I knew anything about G. I told her I didn't and she explained that G's boyfriend had broken up with her that night at the party and that she was worried. I, again, felt a bit hurt that G hadn't told me something that important since the 3 of us had a WhatsApp group chat, but whatever. T tells me not to tell G that she told me the whole story.

G ends up telling me that they had broken up a few days later, but without any details. Just ""we broke up"". T had to go somewhere on vacation or whatever, so she wanted me to talk to G and check up on her (even though G wouldn't really talk to me and I didn't really care at that point because I felt hurt) but I did it anyways because of T and because I felt awfully selfish for feeling hurt when G was the one going through a break up.

A few months pass and my birthday comes around. I was debating wether to invite G or not, because we hadn't talked since the break up. I was having a private conversation with T (via WhatsApp) telling her that I didn't know whether to invite G or not but that I thougt I would because I wanted to give our friendship another try. G was added to the birthday group chat bud didn't say a word and when the day of the birthay came, she didn't show up. At that point G was back together with her boyfriend and T made up some excuse saying that G was staying at her bf's house in another town and she couldn't come. I believed her because I really trusted T and didn't think anything of it, I was just a bit disappointed that G wouldn't come.

A few days after my birthday I was checking Instagram when I saw G had posted a picture of her and her bf the same day of my birthday and they were in the same town I was having my party in. I asked T about if she knew and at firs she said no, but after talking to her some more she said that she lied to me because G saw the conversation we had had about my doubts on inviting her to my birthday and she got mad and dind't want to come.

&#x200B;

I cut them both off that same day. I know I might seem like the bad guy here and that this story is very petty compared to others on here, but I felt like they had been leaving me behind, always meeting without telling me and then they lied to me insted of being upfront and I felt like I wouldn't be able to trust them again."
AskReddit,erq54wr,t3_c332rq,1561135426.0,"About three years ago I was going through a restrictive phase with my eating disorder. I was eating so little that one time I stood up really fast to run to the fridge to check if we had something my mom had asked about and I was so dizzy that I collapsed on the floor hitting my head. I passed out for a fraction of a second and when I recovered consciousness I has shaking uncontrollably (I don't know if it was some kind of seizure). Never told anyone.

&#x200B;

Another time, this was like 7 or 8 years ago (so at like 16-17) I was in the bathtub and for some reason took a small mirror to look at my face. I didn't recognise myself. It probably lasted for less than 30 seconds but that feeling really fucked me up. I had had some depersonalisation experiences before, but nothing that extreme. Really scared me.

&#x200B;

The las one is probably the time I realised that I was seriously thinking about killing myself. For over 10 years I have had somewhat suicidal thoughts, I thought about how I would do it, and I would find myself thinking things like ""If you jump in front of that car/train you'll be dead, it's that easy"", but I never thought I could really do it. This one time I wasn't even thinking about anything specific, it was just this very intense desire to not be alive anymore and in that moment I knew that I would end up killing myself if I didn't do anything about it. That thought passed, but really scared me."
