razer,fho2ebc,t1_fg6370e,1581739251.0,"hello,

I have the razer blade 15 2019 base model with RTX 2060, ive had it for around 4 months, and I have noticed some issues while gaming. Some games Ive played have had frequent fps drops or stuttering, even tho the laptop runs it at pretty high frame rate, some of these games ive heard are not very demanding and business laptops are able to run it according to some utube videos ive watched. I do play my games on an external monitor, with the laptop screen off, the monitor supports G sync and is set to 120hz. Does anyone know if its the laptop's problem? if so how should i go about fixing it. 

The games ive had trouble with are: (all same issues, some worse than others)

\- Overwatch (high settings at high fps, have the same issue even at lowest settings)

\- Borderlands 3 (high settings at 70 ish fps, lowest settings at 120 fps, same issues) 

\- 2k20

\- Jedi fallen orders

The specs of the blade 15 surpasses most of the recommended specs of these games if i remember correctly, so im not sure what the problem is. 

Thanks."

depression,f3slv3x,t3_di0uhl,1571104927.0,"Well i got to be honest with you, life isnt only about romance, its also about yourself, your hobbies, things you like. 

To answer your question according to what you have said it seems like you have a chance? But the thing is that relationship you might be able to start has a high chance of being toxic, judging from the fact that she sees you as a backup almost, and has a history of cheating. People can change of course but if you take that chance to start a relationship with her just be very careful. 

I would also say to find things you enjoy like hobbies, and also to find your self worth else where. Im sorry if I ended up saying things you dont want, but thats how i see it. It is not worth it at all to hurt yourself over this, and I reckon you should seek professional help if you dont already, they might be able to help you with your daily life! But of course answer would be to definitely not end it"

Luckily I dont have PE lessons anymore, but I do have basketball games which I just wear those dri fit long sleeve clothings.
