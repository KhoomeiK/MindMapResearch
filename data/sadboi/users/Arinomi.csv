Norway,fqwhful,t3_gkr77w,1589704538.0,"A couple of points regarding insurance:

1. If it seems very expensive at first, remember that there's a bonus system going. I assume you'll be starting at the bottom, so it'll likely start at 10% or 20%. Every consecutive year of having a car and insurance, regardless of insurance type (ansvar, delkasko, kasko), this bonus will increase by 10% up to a maximum of 70% or 75%. This bonus is a price reduction/discount for going without any claims. Claims will drop your bonus, setting you back 2-3 years of bonus. If you're under 23 or 24 years old, it will also be more expensive.

2. As a former tow truck driver, I beg you to get delkasko, *at a minimum*, regardless of how old the car is. Kasko and delkasko give you extra protection against break in, fire, rental when needed, etc., and *cheap road assistance*. Road assistance does not cut your bonus, and lets you get help for anything (battery, tow to mechanic, etc.) and with delkasko or higher it's much much cheaper than paying them directly. When I was a tower back in 2014, it cost 500kr for any sort of assistance with delkasko or higher. With only ansvar, we had a 1500kr *minimum*, and it only came that low with jump starts in the same town. Imagine dragging your car out of a ditch somewhere remote; it's crazy expensive.


Edit: 
Bonus point not regarding insurance:

""It's not warm out today""
""Yes it is, it's hot today""

In Norwegian, that ""yes"" would be a ""jo"" instead of a ""ja"".

r/homelab, for example, is one of those that seem incredibly expensive. But as I've looked more into it, it seems relatively cheap to get some decent starter gear. 

Gaming can get expensive, but you don't have to have a beefy computer to start off. If you don't mind going back a few years and start with some olden but golden games, you can run it on pretty much anything. 

A lot of hobbies have starter gear that can be rented, like sports shooting and cycling.

AskReddit,foy7p7z,t3_g8tfui,1588167179.0,"So I was playing in the beta of Sea of Thieves, and got grouped with some strangers from the US. I'm from Europe. We played, explored, and had a good time overall, until one crewmate's infant child starts crying in the background. The crying wasn't an issue on my part, I completely understand people having things going on in their lives besides gaming. I believe he was alone with this child, as he didn't ask for any partner to come and help him.   


However, instead of getting up to calm and tend to his assumedly confused and scared child like any father would, he then proceeds to shout, scream and swear at his child, telling it to shut up. This, understandably, didn't ease this baby's fear one single bit, and so it cried even louder. He replied by screaming back, and eventually left his chair. More shouting, screaming, swearing and crying was heard, along with a few thumps. The thumps, I believe, were not related to him physically harming the infant, although I will never know.   


I can't really remember if he left the game before I did, however I left pretty quickly. I recognize an abusive man when I hear one, and I knew talking to him about it would do nothing but infuriate him even further.   


This is the single most horrific thing I've ever heard happen over voice chat, and I honestly hope that piece of shit never gets to see his child(ren) ever again. I didn't think to report it or anything, and I feel bad for that."

She wouldn't be considered unable, she'd be considered *unwilling*, and thus would not be eligible for benefits. All because of her gender.

I imagine us being on rather extreme sides of the political spectrum. Not extreme as in extremism, but I doubt we would land ourselves in the middle.
