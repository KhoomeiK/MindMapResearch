Wellington,fqzy9a3,t1_fqzuu6c,1589778464.0,"Because my manager is a control freak and is bitter that some of us were at home while others were still in the office ( we are considered essential workers).  She's one of those ""well people need to harden up/if I do it this way everyone should"" kind of people. So yeah a bad manager. Never used to be like this but since some of us had to stay home during level lockdown she's been quite toxic about it. Yes I will be looking for a new job."

Ive been at work since level 4 as my partner is immunocompromised. I'm now working from home. 
Generally speaking is it wise to still WFH?  Or will it be ok to venture back to work? I work in an office in a large multi floor building. I had a battle from work to be able to stay home from the start even with a medical cert backing me up. I've messaged my GP also for advice. 
There are people still in the office. I can do a lot of work from home, some I can't but people at the office can. 
My work is very disorganised and I don't trust them honestly.  
Thank you for any advice."

NevilleGoddard,fp8lai2,t3_gbnstd,1588395341.0,"Awesome! First post I see when I open Reddit and winning lotto is what I want to manifest.

I just struggle with visualising it though. Any tips? Like could I visualise getting an email or a notification from my Lotto app telling me I've won a major prize.....? Cos in real life I'm not telling ANYONE! With Lotto here you don't get a cheque, it's all done by deposit into your bank account.  

 Is that living in the end or is that the middle ? 

Sorry I'm still learning,have the audiobook which  I'm listening to. Some of this stuff does go over my head a bit!
