curlyhair,fp7nz3j,t3_gbs93s,1588374264.0,"I'm so happy!! Victory after spending the whole quarantine thus far experimenting with different products. I shampoo + conditioned my hair as per usual last night before bed and plopped my hair overnight because I didn't feel like styling or drying. That part is not my usual routine but my schedule has been a bit weird this week. Anyway, then I showered again today like usual but also styled my hair. 

The routine:

1. S2C a very small amount (quarter size) of SheaMoisture Smooth & Tame Conditioner, then rinse out with my head upside down.
2. Detangle with WetBrush and rake through a generous scoop (size of a lemon?) of ECO Style Olive Oil max hold gel. Distibute gel with WetBrush. 
3. Scrunch in a smaller scoop (quarter size) of the same gel, squeezing out some of the water. 
4. Scrunch/mini plop with microfiber towel. Spray whole head with Melu heat shield and then spray whole head with Ouidad Climate Control Gel (I mixed it in a spray bottle with water to create a sort of wannabe curlmaker.)
5. Plop for 20-30min with tshirt, and then scrunch with same tshirt. 
6. Spray whole head with Tresemme Micro Mist curl hold level 2. 
7. Diffuse on high heat for about 5min, focusing on roots. 
8. Spray whole head with Tresemme again. 
9. Let hair air dry. 

I love how fluffy my hair is with also having some definition. It's soft and shiny.

Mini plopped with microfiber towel and then plopped in a tshirt for \~20min. Scrunched hair again with tshirt after plopping.

-wash with Ouidad Playcurl amplifying shampoo
-dump my head upside down and work in Shea Moisture Daily Hydration condition  
-brush with WetBrush to distribute product
-use the bowl technique to squish to condish 
-work Tresemme Tres Extra Hold gel into my hair and Ouidad Playcurl amplifying foam in just the roots 
-continue using the bowl technique to squish my hair until I got the clumping I wanted (this required thinking I was done a couple of times and then having to get my head wet again) 
-use a microfiber towel to scrunch my hair and partially dry 
-plop for about 20min
