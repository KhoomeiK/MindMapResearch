AskEngineers,exh4lr1,t3_csur4f,1566290966.0,"The term ""Engineer"" is so diluted in its meaning nowadays, a handyman can and do call themselves engineers (at least that's the case in the UK)

However that doesn't mean you are not an engineer. You do not need a degree to be classed as an engineer and I think it's an injustice in the system that you feel you do. Being an engineer isn't just about the qualifications you hold, in fact they play a small insignificant part of it. From the tasks you describe you do for work, you are very much an engineer, and should feel comfortable using the term!"

UKPersonalFinance,evoohx0,t3_ckm3x5,1564652480.0,"Live within your means - don't spend more than you earn - and if you use a credit card pay it off monthly. It's very easy to fall into the debt hole. 

Do enjoy your money a little (but see above pointers) 

If you're getting a car try not to finance it - my boss told me that there are 2 types of young people ""those who sit outside McDonalds in their nice flash cars, and those who can afford to actually go in and eat there"" strictly speaking it's not true but it has stuck with me. 

Invest in yourself - do some courses to increase career prospects if you are that way inclined. 

Save, save and invest. Get an emergency fund together of at least 6 months (I go for 12, personally) expenditure. Don't stop saving when you get to that point though. Once you have that, consider investing for better long-term returns. The sooner you start the more compounding you will experience."

dating,eq26n4z,t3_bx0o10,1559729712.0,"First, I'm kinda jealous of the proverbial balls you displayed! 

My advice, is advice I was given for my first date (different circumstances but is still relevant), don't overthink it, enjoy yourself and show a genuine interest in what the person you are dating is saying (they should be reciprocating this) ask relevant questions etc. And the good ol' be yourself. Don't try to come across as a different person. Nerves are an important part of a first, second, third date so on, so don't be worried about them. You will have some silences that may seem awkward - that's okay it's normal, try to fill them by asking a question, most importantly relax and enjoy it! 

Post date - if it went well you will feel great that will lead to a lull in your mood, and all you will want to do is talk to them and see them again. Play it cool, I think this is the most dangerous point, you don't wanna come off too strong too early. And if it goes well you might even have another date on the horizon!
If it doesn't go so well it's not the end of the world, try not to dwell on it too much because you may feel down for a bit, but it'll pass."
