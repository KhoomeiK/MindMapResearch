I just made a switch from a romance story. For reference, this is a f/f story, so idk if that has anything to do with pacing. Basically, I'm a n00b, but not at writing sex scenes, just how a story should be crafted in erotica (like, is there a erotica journey)? That sort of thing.

Let those children in foster care be adopted out, and have children of  their own. 

Children in foster care is something the world could end, but chooses to ignore. If you think you're ready for a child, then you can adopt one and learn how to live with whatever trauma they need help getting over, because you're going to deal with tough shit anyway in life with your children, so you might as well adopt. 

I'm biased though as I've known... about a handful of adopted children. 

But picture this: you know somebody who works with orphanages and chooses to not adopt. What the hell is wrong with that picture, like, it's obvious you really didn't care, or you'd practice what you preach and adopt. Hypocrisy at its finest.

It is hard to write about anything, I've found, since you must do research, but there's three things I caution against, which I won't bring up here since they're heavy, triggery topics, although one of them we're talking about (mental illness).

What is different is that we're talking about a disorder, and since they specifically asked about mental illness, as somebody who has clinically diagnosed PTSD, BP NOS, GAD, and OCD, it's extremely frustrating when people who aren't in that group end up getting what it's like wrong. 

Like, a normal person doesn't understand waking up suicidal, then crying (sometimes for an extended period of time), then gets up and eats and then sees one thing and their entire mood has been flipped to anger or laughter.

One is more nuanced than the other, and imagine you've struggled your whole life to write about your anxiety ridden character and instead, some author who spent a lot of money on advertising makes it big but gets everything wrong (like 50 shades and the BDSM community). Which would you rather read? Accurate, or entertaining but misleading and possibly dangerous (like 13 Reason's Why)?

3. I would like to see people with anxiety disorders, bipolar, etc. write books about their disabilities instead of people without them writing about mental illness. I get it, write whatever you want, but know you will be judged, but I'm sure /r/writing told you to come here for more info (guessing) but as somebody with SM & a litany of mental illness, it's super annoying when somebody who is ""normal"", i.e.w/o mental illness writes about mental health.

The doctors are usually taken aback and tell me it's not necessary (out of procedure), but it is necessary to know and to learn.   


You sacrificed so much for me and my life, and what if my actions lead to detection to another person with ToF, because, for that fellow going into cardiology, they're going to immediately recognize ToF or a murmur, or a PVC.   


While you don't feel like a hero, and you feel guilt, please know that everybody knows how hard you try, not just to help others, but to keep your composure in stressful situations. Death is inevitable, and I have severe death anxiety (to the point I'm on a benzo and another med for anxiety). I had to come to terms with this. How I did was seeing a tattoo that was an infinity symbol that read, *you can't save everyone.* I had to exit the premises I was in tears due to personal events in my life.   


You are on the front-lines, so you will see the worst, but know that we have your back. We will continue to have your back. It's okay to be scared, sad, and to cry and get angry. You are only human, but in the realm of humanity, you are a hero.   


I was in marching band, and for better or for worse, we moved as  individuals, as one unit. We held our chins high, and with each defeat.   


Eyes; With Pride!   
Even if tears are streaming down your face, know that you did the best damn job possible given all circumstances, and don't let anything or anyone or yourself take that knowledge away from you.   


You are a hero because you fight medical villains. Isn't that what a hero is? Somebody who cares, is compassionate, and fights villains?   


You are fighting for a safe future, and by god, I'm staying home to give your daughter a safer future. 

Love yourself, all medical personnel out there, because we love you."

BipolarReddit,fl8ns5l,t3_flj9pp,1584927990.0,"My meds take away my mania and I lost my dogs last year so I've been in a state of depression and this COVID thing has me scared out of my wits. It's all anybody in my family can talk about, myself included, because it's the only source of mental stimulus that I've been getting. 

Now there's a lockdown and I was supposed to just.... christ this is has been so bad. I feel like I fucked up my relationship with my boyfriend, I did fuck up a relationship with my cousin, and my two best friends, one is finally sober--thank god--but she never speaks to me anymore. 

My other best friend is into stoicism and tells me that I can just will this all away, and he's been off his medication for months I just found out and his insurance won't refill them--he's schizophrenic. 

I just... I want to cry and my boyfriend keeps telling me I have no empathy, but he's thinking of cognitive empathy as there are different types, and he's just not doing well and taking it out on me, and I know it's not him. 

I'm paranoid again--that the cops are going to kill me (I have no reason to be afraid except my heart condition vs. tazer = death), that my bf is cheating on me, and that he's going to get the damn virus since he works at big box mart. 

I just.... fuck. I'm losing my mind. The noise is so loud and my PTSD is making symptoms 10x worse. I just needed to vent."

First, I'm super sorry you have to deal with that. I'm in the same boat, pretty much (ptsd, screaming family members just because that's the dynamic), and my own mental health was getting bad. I second what /u/uxhelpneeded said. When the screaming starts, I put on music and write stories or go on youtube, or, \*sighs\* crunchyroll because I'm a huge nerd lol.   


Locking the door will also make it so you don't have to look at the door 30 plus times. Also, you just helped me figure out why my neck is strained. It's from doing exactly that. It's a sense of security. Also, if you are able to, put on rain sounds or anything to block out the noise.   
Much peace to you because you deserve it, and wishing you safety during these trying times."

My bf stopped drinking altogether after that night. I knew it wasn't him because he kept calling me my store managers name (who is a guy and I'm not). 

I would wait to see what he has to say.  Sometimes people do the worst things while drunk even if they're a good person.  

Good luck. Stay safe."

writing,fkw27g9,t3_fkyobb,1584581785.0,"Grim, dark, deep depression. Your mind plays tricks on you. Your bones hurt. Usually you're isolated or grieving. Worthless, worthless, worthless will replay in your mind over and over until you believe it. Self-hate plays a role. Honestly, suicide is one of the one things I won't ever write about because my best friend's father told me to ""Look after"" his son days before he committed suicide and I feel like if you haven't been there, you really can't write about it correctly in a fictional way because it is the epitome of a bad spot for all people. 

The thing about suicide is that you **usually** don't see it coming. So create your character how you want, super happy go lucky or glum, and maybe you can do a reveal of the suicide through a happy go lucky character.

Definitely do your research and tread lightly because if the story isn't about suicide but starts out with it, a lot of people are going to put it down.  


I am just one opinion though, but I have been hospitalized for suicidal intentions."
