No cellphone videos of performances, or even songs with just lyrics, no other songs period, just a very odd trailer.  I live in Chicago so I have seen hundreds of people you're describing, most have a substantial amount content. I'm not trying to dismiss your comment by any means because that was the impression I was under until I saw the lack of his music. I can also understand some people make content for themselves, maybe he does.

I say this from my own experience also, I've never had relationships last longer than 2 years and my current one has only been 1 yr & 7/8 months but there really isn't any reason for me to think there's an issue. He knows my diagnosis, and my past with heroin. Because of this I had an incredibly hard time believing I would be accepted, I would always ask if he didn't like me, and once I nicely asked if I had to go to a psych ward would you stop talking to me? He said ""I don't know"", now this is after I've been to maybe 5 inpatient stays or more before him, but still it was garbage. That made everything turn to shit.  Either way  I confronted him later and we were able to turn it around, sometimes people who don't have experience with these types of things have a manufactured image of crazy or just don't understand how they're supposed to react, this is where your information and experience is valuable.i have been diagnosed schizophrenic by multiple Drs and Im afraid if I told certainly people ( who have seen me cationic from pills, have heard me reply to nothing, the lack of sense I make when communicating at times) they won't believe me because they think it's some convoluted fight club thing. As for my boyfriend he's actually maybe one of the few people who don't think I'm totally bat shit, we both heard a strange whistle coming from the wall and other things so it's actually made me feel a bit more validated for leaving the medicine and Drs. Behind me. I've gotten tremendous help from therapy and mindtrials tho. A lot of what you say sounds like you expect people to run away, leave you, or neglect you. I can't speak on anyone I don't know, but i don't believe that's true.

It doesn't get more illegal than not accommodating to meds. 
I was hired at a 24 hr DD, I applied to start after 9 am but they asked me to start 530 am to 12 pm . I told them I could come in after I get medicine at my clinic which is open 5:30am -12:00pm, I said if I got a copy of my schedule I could MAYBE get my medicine. In 15 min I went to my clinic and went to work. Immediately I was yelled at and they said they thought I was getting medicine. Obviously this was my first sick  feeling with nerves. I couldn't get it if I started the very next day as my clinic was closed after my interview, and I certainly couldn't talk to anyone until I wasn't having to rush my dose and go to work. So they had me work 5:00am to 11:00pm one day and I was unable to get dosed before work. That day I threw up twice at work and they told me to leave and I was even hesitant but it's also not appropriate to be serving coffee, food, ECT. In my condition. I knew this was going to be blamed on my medicine and I was getting sick of them not seeing how hard I was trying for them. I think I left around 9:45 and after I went to get dosed I threw up my medicine too. Later I got a text from the boss boss who wasn't even there telling me not to come back without a doctor's note saying I could work. He Implied that I was pretending to be sick or something. I wish I reported this guy. Not only was and am I protected by American with disabilities act but I had been so upfront that they already agreed to let me come in after dosing so the fact they tried to make me go around it then fire me for the result was illegal on their part. I do have a serious diagnosis, and I may need certain accommodations, that being said it didn't have a damn thing to do with my ability to do my job but I was the easiest one to take it out on.

As far as your feelings right now, I think I can understand that too, usually this anger comes over me and I just want to be dead. It's always a feeling that comes with frustration rather than sadness but I think recognizing those triggers and changing to avoid them can really help.

If you police people over insignificant  things that are subjective like emojis maybe you're more annoying and toxic than a damn emoji??
I'm not really complaining over this only, I've been on Reddit for a few months and Im realizing most subs, community's, and users on here are only nice to people they agree with, people with some sort of (Reddit) status, and users who fall in line with the popular opinion, even if you're not being disrespectful or prejudice. This not only holds back our perspective but this is the shit people have always done to others, most agree it's wrong but a good amount will join in.

Buying with Other sellers is a nightmare when it comes to returns and I'm really surprised how they seem to side with the seller without listening to the customer and the description will magically change once the item is shipped. I ordered a ring $70, it's gold (10k) said 2 grams. When I weighed it I got 1.6g. the big deal is 1gram of gold ($53) would have been in it but it was actually $42. Not a bad deal but makes me wonder if there was a reason they wanted to get rid of them. Anyway I noticed someone bought out the rings after  I ordered one and when I went back to the description it now read 1.5 grams. My guess is after it sold out they changed it, probably  because they weren't in stock and now it can at least match what everyone got."

 I may not know or understand the relationship but I've had quite a bit of issues with ""professionals"", doing and saying very unprofessional things at work. I.e. being told your not really anything you ever diagnosed because you smoked weed at 14,(being told as a 25 year old adult speaking about mental health to a Dr while inpatient ). Or  Once I had a Dr on 1st meeting without asking any ?s say one of my diagnosis was wrong ""because we wouldn't be talking like this"".  A group leader yelled at me because I said it was different being inpatient than an employee so she screamed at me about how she NEVER gets thank you cards! 

When I delt with those people I didn't know I had power to report it, and I would do that now if it happened. All I did was just nod and change drs. I now realize that doesn't change the issue as it doesn't effect their access to mental health patients.  I have a lot more testimony on this profession that is unsettling, but there were a few people who don't do that type of job, reguardless I decide I could no longer seek help from this industry for bettering myself, only listen to their suggestions to decide what's best for me. Im still working on it and use professional services, but I'm not expecting everyone to be professional. 
If you don't like someone don't feel obligated to stay or continue treatment if it's not helping.

It was going to take a while to ship and for 3 mo my item say in Singapore. Customer service suggested I contact seller so I would ask about it and sent for a refund and never got,  this messaging had to happen a few times with no answer before I eventually got distracted and then I remembered this ring after ordering some recently. I went to my old orders and it was there but didn't say delivered or refunded.  So I went to the customer service option and went through that run around to just contact them and say they should look into this company. Customer service replied 
MAR 20,2020 Was very apologetic they said the seller issued a refund and would be 3-5 business days. All the links provided to check didn't actually work (even said click here:)  On the 28th I contacted customer service and said I was told I'd be refunded but still wasn't, this reply had a link I couldn't access. That's when a person on chat said I was refunded mar 15, 2020, 5 days before I was contacted by CS? They said the money from gift cards was my  from my refund (6.37). They also sent me ""proof"" of being refunded, it said I was refunded mar 15 2020 with an order number. This is when I took a break out of sheer frustration. The next day I go back to my message so I can calmly say why nothing they said made sense,  this time they said I was refunded in Mar 2018. Mar 15 and that was a typo, I asked why they're proof of refund had to be typed out andwhy customer service didn't say that I was, nor does my order say it was ever refunded. They basically said they're going to have to train that agent better. I made it clear it's not the agents fault CS promised me a refund that you can somehow only see I was issued and can't send any actual proof of.  
Honestly they were so snobby about it and just started asking if they could help me with anything else, I think I'm going to compile this mess of a encounter for Amazon and try to contact someone higher not for my refund but for the insanity of using Amazon's resources."

Miscarriage,fjm6jf0,t3_fdin8s,1583462763.0,"I just had a complete nightmare with this! 

Short version: from December 9th to March 4th. But that's not normal.

Long version: My first Dr. Visit they didn't see a heartbeat on 12/09 but no one said anything to me, they went out of their way to say they weren't looking for one on my sonogram, I was 7wks. I never had a sonogram for heartbeat only vaginal so I couldn't tell anyways. This was my 3rd pregnancy (none living). They didn't schedule me back until 1/10 where they said they didn't see one a month ago either.  Clearly they wrote down there was no activity on my records (even tho they weren't looking).I was pissed! Before this time I went to another Dr. because I wanted to see a heartbeat, they turned me down and said they don't take high risk pregnancies. So I was basically stuck waiting. I hadn't been addressed about my miscarriages until 11wks. Anyways they said I could wait 8wks to pass. I thought wtf, why wasn't that entire month added to that? I went to a few labs to confirm & 01/22 I went to the ER because it was the 2nd night of contractions/ cramps with bleeding. I never had taken more than one day to pass. Right before the ER did the ultrasound I had passed a clot in the bathroom, I thought it must have been the sac. When I went back to my Dr. He said the ER labs showed the sac was still there. At this point I called another Dr to see what they could do to help because he again said I could wait 8wks to pass while they have 5+ wks of recording this. I was still not sure when I'd have it so I talked to this Dr about My ER  discharge paperwork. This suggested I talk to my OBGYN about Ativan (I'm assuming.for the stress and or pain of passing). I gave him the paper during the visit and he read nothing handed it back and said ""this isn't for me."" I really wanted to pass this naturally so I said id like the Ativan since I'm still passing, he didn't care if I took it.  When I left and asked about a prescription  he said he doesn't perscribe ""antipsychotics."" Where did he get his degree?  It's literally a sedative, and besides that he wanted to lecture me about mental health, his job is actually to provide those resources, which were never offered. That was the last visit I had with him, since I already spoke to another Dr and had a visit planned I thought no way could they be worse. New doc gave me a prescription to make me contract after confirming results on Feb 03.  Unfortunately my Feb 17th ultrasound came back with tissue left over, even though I passed the sac. The Dr had me go in for a vaccum procedure on the 26th (where I was prescribed BY AN OBGYN a way stronger benzodiazipne than Ativan for the procedure). I was supposed to be healed yesterday but I worry it's not."

Im in a type of family where I became a person who's talked about more than talked to, maybe it was easier for me to take the lack of emotional support but I still felt like grabbing their face and shaking it...

If pills aren't for you then don't look to them either. Maybe you can talk to them though and let them know you're aware that this is the case, ask them to hold you accountable. If you can't stop work it out so they can leave and give you time to reflect before you react. 
I know it's not that others can control your behavior not should anyone have to manage you but just saying "" Hey your pushing an argument, do I need to give you space?"" After that If you can't reevaluate things because it's too hard then get in the habit of walking away and thinking before you speak further. Personally I feel reflecting on myself and past behavior (a lot) is what helps me grow."

I also don't think he's gay,he may play and what not but he also seems so self aware he comes off gay that I don't see why he'd hide it. I'd guess he's not sexual, maybe has issues or doesn't do much sexual exploring.  If they were broken up that would really explain a lot .
New to the show/community so I apologize agian if this is old news."
DuggarsSnark,fj5a7gf,t1_fj4rxps,1583027902.0,"My boyfriend was under the impression Abbbie's parents encouraged her to marry JD
(granted he doesn't pay any attention). It makes more sense the more I see tho. Her mom told her to talk to JD, but I can't imagine anyone crushing on him, even  Duggar fans."
FundieSnark,fiu0ndh,t3_f9t7p4,1582733113.0,"Wouldn't a tattoo, debt, as well as losing ones virginity all be on the past?  IMHO there is something  about Lori that's off mentally, I wonder if her brain tumor formed or changed when she started this crap . Almost everything she says is hypocritical of her life, family, or something else she's said."
FundieSnark,fis0uj2,t3_f9etb6,1582675224.0,"Amazing job, Jill gives her kids disgusting style tips, reguardless of ""modesty"". Ironically I get a tacky 91 boudoir vibe from Jill's look. Hideous ik, i can only imagine that green eyeliner being passed down a line  of girls."
DuggarsSnark,fiisamk,t1_fiidsy8,1582425695.0,"I remember them having bangs as kids in 14 kids doc. Bill Gothard likes girls having long, curly hair. I think I'm terms of going against IBLP Joy and Jessa having bangs isn't at all shocking from what I've seen. Maybe they think there being kinda ""worldly"" and that goes against IBLP, so I get that. Jill and Jinger also wear pants and that goes directly against the IBLP's modesty standards."
FundieSnark,fi1do8u,t1_fhz15bn,1582055675.0,"My theory is they wanted her husband to leave her so they could say they take care of Amy and get all donations ( not like they didn't get enough already out of Amy's accident) . This was when they were living in the RV I think. Either hoping this would make it easier to either get a house (because they basically have been given homes) or just take the one Amy and her husband had before. Im sure David would build her some sort of cage/ closet and ask for more donations to build an addition to make her kids their cages. 
 Im dead serious about that! 
I think Jill is way too into what she gets out of everything. Imo her old blogs were so telling. She's gone bonkers convincing herself God wants these things because living it has made her miserable."
