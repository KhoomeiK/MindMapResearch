depression,f8lq64t,t3_dpl4bu,1574624441.0,"I sort of know how you feel... the more I live this life, the more I feel like I’m deceiving everyone and myself. On the outside, I look happy to people. Of course I have days where I can’t hide my unhappy expression. And when people ask me, I just say that I’m tired and had an exhausting night of work but in reality, it’s just sadness taking over me. I can’t confide in parents because they obviously don’t understand (trust me, I’ve tried) and I don’t want to burden them. I tried confiding in friends non-directly because again I didn’t want to bring up problems like these to people I care about. I’ve tried in the past to actually let them know but again, the double life role kicked in where I pretended that it was all over and I was happy again.

It’s tough man 😥 

After a few months of isolating myself, I started to change. I was an extrovert (or at least that’s what people would say). But now, deep down, I feel like I’ve changed. Of course I can still talk to people and be friendly with them but I can’t be my true self. In that sense I still have my outgoing personality but this is all becoming a cover 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

And these days it’s all just kicking in. I’ve lost my friends that I thought I was close with. I shut myself out from them but it hurts that they weren’t able to see anything that I was going through. Yes I understand that that’s not fair for them. But I feel like if we were close friends, they would be able to tell somethings different you know? 

Sorry this is all over the place huh. Didn’t mean to take over and start my story, it just kind of came out and I found myself typing this all out. But anyways, i just wanted to say that I completely understand what you mean about living a double life.

I would say you’re not alone but I feel like that might not be any sort of advice on consolation. That also may not be the best comment. Just know that there is someone who understands what you mean and what you’re going through!"
AskReddit,f8lm60d,t3_cj0xr7,1574623429.0,"This doesn’t quite answer the question but I would prefer to die at my happiest moment. Rather than waiting to age and have to burden others to take care of me, I would want to die on the spot, you know, immediately. Doesn’t really matter how as long as I was happy with the way things were in my life 🤷🏻‍♀️"
