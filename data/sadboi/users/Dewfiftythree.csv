depression,ezy8qq7,t1_ezy6u8j,1568261281.0,"I can relate. I'm nearly 30 and have no idea what I've done with my 20s. My uni degree was a blurr. My brain fog sometimes makes me feel like I have early onset dementia. 

I've tried medication but didn't like it because of the side effects on libido.  The gp just said that's the case for all antidepressants. What have you tried?"

depression,ezxpt8i,t1_ezwvjfs,1568246572.0,I feel the same. I've started to feel envious and angry towards young people. I've spent my entire 20s choosing the wrong people and staying with people that only destroyed my confidence.

depression,ezxpebe,t1_ezwcvu1,1568246261.0,I have my partner. He's  the only one that makes me feel a little like myself. But even then it's only 2 days out of the week that I feel a little like myself and even then I just agree to do what he wants to do because I don't care. He isn't interested in some of my hobbies so I've just stopped doing them. I get so worried about losing people that I do whatever to make them happy. Or what I think will make them happy
