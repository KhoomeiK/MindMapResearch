Anxiety,fl52xvn,t3_fmnej8,1584827295.0,"I would not mix CBD with any RX at this point, but especially an SSRI. When I looked into it, there’s a risk of seratonin syndrome when you add CBD. Especially if your doctor doesn’t know you are adding it. Beyond serotonin syndrome, CBD DOES seem act in the brain to some degree - this opens up the possibility of other interactions that are not yet known.

Maybe it’s changed since I looked into it. But since supplements are literally unregulated, I feel that it’s a big risk. It’s very possible you aren’t getting any CBD at all in your product.

Since supplements cost money, and often the reputable ones (with effective products) are expensive... and there’s not compelling evidence(yet) CBD is especially effective, I wouldn’t spend the money. Even if serotonin syndrome wasn’t a possible issue."
