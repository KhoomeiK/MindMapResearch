BeautyGuruChatter,fke6sbf,t1_fkdep3q,1584106608.0,Yeah I stopped following her because of her “I put more effort in my content than everyone else” attitude was really bothering me. She did make good content but it just eventually started rubbing me the wrong way.

Made my skin look pretty bad too. Also so many people used to rec the KVD tattoo liner before all her controversies happened and I HATE it. It smears everywhere and not opaque and I don’t get the hype.   
I got Ofras Glazed Donut because Nikki obviously recommended it since it was her collar, and it’s honestly the only highlighter I use now. I love it."

SixFeetUnder,fiizs28,t1_fiizcr9,1582431143.0,"Except you have no other information about me or what I’m going through, so deciding I need therapy based on a single post is 1) not your place and 2) not enough information to base anything on. You’re not a doctor, you don’t know what kind of medical help that I’ve gotten, you know nothing about me. So it **is** rude and it definitely comes off as belittling me. It’s not your place.   
All I was asking was if others felt the same or have had a similar experience, and they have. Your comment wasn’t really all that helpful or constructive, just rude and unnecessary."
SixFeetUnder,fiiu959,t1_fiisvu1,1582427034.0,Do you feel better belittling others mental health? Haha. You don’t know what my life is like so please don’t tell me what to do. People on this thread have agreed with me. So maybe... don’t try to make others feel bad? I already felt weird posting and trying to making me feel bad isn’t cool.

The shade Pig-ment I use as blush and Tanacon as contour so it honestly works really well for getting done most of my face makeup done too. I genuinely really like most of the colors, especially the shimmer ones. Diet Cola, Illuminatea, Trisha and Spiraling are so beautiful on the eye.   
The only two colors in the palette I think they should have changed out with something else are the orange/red because they didn’t really fit in as much. But that’s just my opinion 😅"

BeautyGuruChatter,f9thr88,t1_f9tg9fo,1575624917.0,"that’s what I’m saying. he should have either disclosed that they were gonna be stickers or pick something else. they’re cute enough designs and all, but he definitely could have put something better in there. I love me some stickers, but they’re one time use items and I wanna know that I’m getting them. to a broke ass bitch like me, $14 is a lot to spend on stickers. when you think you’re getting a makeup item you think you’re going to get continuous use out of. socks, pop socket, bandana, pins, keychains, etc. would have all been better substitutes. even a mini liquid lip would have been fine."
BeautyGuruChatter,f9tfggj,t3_e6u1vk,1575621420.0,"I’m not sticking up for him, so please don’t come at me, but as an independent artist I charge up to $4.50 per individual sticker so the price makes sense to *me*, however I think he should have either made it clear that they were gonna be stickers, or add another makeup product. He has a huge makeup company and merch company and he doesn’t really need to charge that much money for them because he’s mass producing them. A bit shady."

Not to like.... piss you off or something?   
To clarify, literally all I was trying to ask was would you have preferred a big production like the previous years? Or that they should have added more of what they already were doing to incorporate more people like Etika? I would have asked this to any other person who said they disliked it. I don’t know why you’re freaking out."

BeautyGuruChatter,f9soo43,t1_f9soj1r,1575596843.0,You quoted me... okay? What are you trying to get at? It is fine. I was genuinely asking what you thought they should have done differently since you didn’t like it.

She also said that this has happened before back in her career and she freaked out at the person and she says she still feels bad about it because she thought she should’ve just messaged them. And that’s why she didn’t want to show be persons name.

She says she doesn’t want to call them out for it because she doesn’t want to make more drama in the beauty community because she says that’s what it all feels like now. She also goes into detail about the drama within the community and how she hates it and why.    
“I don’t care about drama, I care about art,” She says, and I wish more youtubers had this mentality these days.   
She talks about how she does photoshopping photos by fixing lighting, editing contact colors, and other small things and how she’s clear and open about it.   
She makes a lot of really good points through the video and she’s so reasonable and understanding. I’m only half way through but I feel like the rest of the video is about all of the above. I’ll update if any other important things get mentioned!"

BeautyGuruChatter,f5h1ivc,t3_dnt7kf,1572199378.0,"This was really interesting to watch. It makes sense why some of them got their collabs with brands but like... why didn’t some other more popular youtubers get collabs? Or why did the semi-popular creators get collabs? Obviously numbers aren’t everything but it is weird/interesting.    
For example, why did Jaclyn get sooo many collabs when she was at the bottom of the list for nearly the entire video? Why didn’t Zoella get more collabs considering she was at the top of the list almost the entire video? Why don’t the consistent YouTubers (Nikkietutorials, grav3yardgirl, or whoever half of these people that stayed high on the list are) get more collabs?   
Also I know I mentioned this already but fuck, Zoella stayed up at the top for a REALLY long time. I thought she was out of popularity in 2014 but I guess I was wrong?   
Also it’s weird to see some youtubers that have been in the game for a long time just now finally getting collabs.    
I dunno. I’m a slut for useless data.   
edit: also Kathleenlights has done a million of colourpop collabs and shes not even on the list most of the video. I don’t understand. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
