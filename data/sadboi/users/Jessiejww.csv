suggestmeabook,fjajuch,t1_fj9wx4e,1583174933.0,"I got this recommendation a lot, also heard a lot of amazing things about him. His books just seem intimidating to me for some reason, same problem I have with The Wheel Of Time"
suggestmeabook,fjajpw8,t1_fj9xcl0,1583174875.0,I've never heard of the series you recommend so I'm gonna look in to them! And I already had the idea to listen to the audiobooks!

Fantasy,fjaffba,t1_fjae67p,1583172388.0,"I have re-read all the series I mentioned a couple of times since. I stopped reading new series, cause I wouldn't be able to focus on them, even tho I had no problem just re-reading or re-listening to the story's I already loved. But every time I picked up something new I just gave up after the first few chapters.

Brandon Sanderson is someone whose books I know I should read, but i'm just afraid they will be really hard to get in to because of the hard magic systems etc."
Fantasy,fja4y84,t1_fj9xegy,1583166478.0,"I heard a lot of really good things about Brandon Sanderson, especially about Mistborn and Lightbringer. Only for some reason those seem very intimidating because of the magic systems and everything surrounding it. But as this is a stand alone novel, it could be a good introduction before maybe eventually reading those"
Fantasy,fja4ez5,t1_fja17el,1583166157.0,"I actually started reading Farseer when I was 12, and it was the last series I ever started before I stopped reading. I came halfway trough the first book, and I remember kinda liking it.  So it's actually really good recommendation. I just remember the book being kinda slow? This can be something I don't remember correctly. But I'm really considering checking out again"
