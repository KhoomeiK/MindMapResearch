Thank you for sharing, really helps more than you can imagine.
Stay safe,"

lonely,fi4xx3i,t3_f6am68,1582150688.0,"I used to push everyone away and didnâ€™t have friends, but I got so lonely with time, so I had a friend, we opened up to each other and we shared very deep shit together.
Then she decided to end it for some understandable reasons that I cannot blame her for it, so I went back to loneliness, but this time, I am empty and hollow too."
BPD,ff0a8f0,t3_eqrdtd,1579466857.0,"I wish I understood that and knew how to deal with it with my BPD friend, she was my best friend but I didnâ€™t show it in a way that makes her sees it, so she took the decision to part to save herself from potential pain, which I understood and supported.

However, I miss her and need her, she was my only friend and now loneliness is killing me."

Even though no one of them is your best friend, they still are a good distraction from loneliness."

Also everyone has his own pace and way of dealing with relationships that makes the comparison invalid.
Wish you the best."

bicycletouring,fc52evf,t3_e5p10v,1577439593.0,"I use my iPhone 6s Camera and I have a GoPro hero 5 black with a small tripod.

The phone has a good quality and is great for quick shots, I usually have it in my saddle bag and I get many pictures with it.

The GoPro requires to be set up with the tripod and all, but it take wide pictures with great resolution so you can crop of them as you like, I control it from my phone via itâ€™s app, so I can take pictures remotely, Hence, pictures for myself with the bike and the roads and the landscape.
I also shoot videos and I can extract frames from it as pictures.
It is also useful to has different mounts for it, I take it to the water with me as it is water proof and take some pictures.

Sometimes I set my phone on the ground and get it standing by some rocks, adjusting a 10-seconds timer and run to have my picture taken."

I think for a much longer tours a proper touring bike would be better though specially if I am going to add front panniers."
