BPD,fkdc3hn,t1_fkbqis3,1584073878.0,I’m very similar. I have been single for 3 month and this is the longest I have been single since I was 12  and I’m now 33. Sadly I’m not exaggerating.
BPD,fkcy46f,t1_fkapglo,1584063841.0,I felt that in my soul and I feel a little called out.
BPD,fkcwpcx,t1_fkabogo,1584062904.0,"You could be correct, although I don’t mean to be flirty I sometimes find myself saying things in ways that come across slightly flirty but I also do it when I’m talking to woman as well so I’m not really trying to do it, it just sometimes comes off that way I guess."
BPD,fj838um,t1_fj5tkae,1583104162.0,"That’s pretty much what I have been doing. I can’t bring myself to leave the house very often because I don’t even know where I would go or what I would do. I also get my groceries and things delivered because I can’t handle busy stores. I also have been trying to make friends with people online and join a few groups but I really don’t have any hobbies or real interests at the moment, maybe that’s just the depression. I feel like having friends online is safer than having friends in real life and it stops me from dating and jumping into so thing again. I just wish the feeling of emptiness would go away, it’s getting to the point where starting to miss my very narcissistic ex and that’s not a good thing."
