BipolarReddit,fpw0los,t3_gftmhn,1588955171.0,Exact same scenario for me.  I never feel hungry and usually lose wait when hypo and then I gain it all back when depressed.

HealthAnxiety,fpmkijl,t1_fplvi0p,1588735096.0,I love Twenty one Pilots.  It might sound silly but their music gave me hope in a really dark time in my life.  Got to see them live last october it was one of the best times of my life.

bipolar2,fpbyjut,t3_gcb4lc,1588482160.0,Fucking up relationships.  It’s so hard when you have a mental disorder that makes you so unpredictable and moody.
BipolarReddit,fp25q1h,t3_gatz15,1588255682.0,"That’s hypomania for sure.  That’s exactly how I get when I’m hypomanic, I am 36, been diagnosed for about 10 years now and my episodes have definitely changed over the years.  I used to do a lot of drugs and crazy stuff and I no longer do those but sometimes the urges are still there.  I have also noticed I get way more irritable and everything and anything sets me off, I have completely raged and cried because my coffee was made wrong.  It’s so frustrating, wishing you nothing but the best!"
bipolar2,fomw9z6,t1_fom9tt9,1587905813.0,Same
HealthAnxiety,fo5rk3z,t3_g5s8pk,1587533484.0,This is what started my health anxiety because I had the hardest time accepting that anxiety could cause so many physical symptoms and thought something has to be wrong with me.  This sub actually helped me more than anything else because reading about so many others having the same symptoms helped me to be able to accept it myself.
HealthAnxiety,fo4fmll,t3_g5ha4y,1587503544.0,"I too get this, I had myself convinced that I had lung cancer or blood clots.  What’s weird was my health anxiety improved a lot once I realized that’s all it was.  I just try to remind myself when I get scared about something that it’s just my anxiety and if I really had a life threatening illness It would last a lot longer than a few seconds or minutes."
BipolarReddit,fnr2byj,t3_g27qml,1587177608.0,"I find it interesting that others have mania coinciding with the seasons changing, I have also experienced this for as long as I can remember and like clockwork every fall it gets pretty bad and then again In spring to summer."

HealthAnxiety,fis1w7o,t3_f9h18h,1582675917.0,"I disagree, I came here not fully believing that my issues were related to anxiety, it really helped me seeing so many others having the same symptoms as me and I realized all of my symptoms were anxiety,  it’s actually gotten a bit better since then."

HealthAnxiety,fgrjjxv,t1_fgr8ddh,1581048436.0,"I get those as well, do they think yours is anxiety related?  That was what actually started the health anxiety for me.  I thought I was having a heart attack and went to the hospital the first time it happened and it scared the crap out of me."

pettyrevenge,fdmb7t9,t3_el5bj3,1578544497.0,"At bigger stores and such there are a bunch but certain places only have one or two.  For example,  there was only 1 at a small town post office I used to drive a client to and I can’t even remember how many times someone was parked, not in the actual space, but in the grid next to it.  I would have to ask people to move all of the time."
pettyrevenge,fdkhsv0,t1_fdhj66t,1578504145.0,I do live in the US and It’s a small parking lot at her school and there is only one handicapped space.

It’s the only handicapped spot as well.  I’ve also seen people park in the grid next to it.  I have told the principal and absolutely nothing was done about it."

I love your idea I wish I had a friend who could understand what I’m going through and we could help each other out."
bipolar_irl,f82vpr1,t3_dylfyb,1574199138.0,It’s one of the tings I hate the most like why can’t I just have a clean organized house like everyone else. I finally just accepted it probably never will be.
AmItheAsshole,f6npyn8,t3_ds0ryw,1572997170.0,Yes you are the asshole here and that was so petty on your part and it’s not cool to make your kid lie for you and put him in the middle.
misophonia,ez9z3wc,t3_d0gttt,1567792121.0,Ugh poor you!!!  We always sleep with a fan and and sometimes shit will get caught in there and drives me insane until it’s fixed.  We can’t even put the ceiling fan on because the chains make noises and I am always the only one annoyed by it.

relationships,eugxbjp,t3_cgfpzi,1563816634.0,I just got a second job actually and we have five kids youngest is 4.
relationships,eugx50g,t1_eugwuni,1563816524.0,Yes I can agree with this and I have been nagging him a lot since he started the job because The Whole reason was to make more money.  He’s making way less and doesn’t ever know how much he’s going to get or when it’s extremely difficult to budget when you don’t know how much or when you will get paid.
relationships,eugwuv4,t3_cgfpzi,1563816374.0,Our rent isn’t even getting paid on time.  That’s why I have an issue i don’t want to change who he is I love him a lot and I wouldn’t have spent 13 years of my life with him if I didn’t.  Before he started this job things were good and I didn’t bitch about the smoking but if he wants to keep a job that pays 500 less a month than he needs to find ways to save in other areas.  Or go back to the job that he was making more money.
relationships,eugwfu9,t1_eugvj12,1563816156.0,Smoking doesn’t bother me but when that comes before everything else and you are putting that over putting food on the table I have an issue.  And spending 200 bucks in a ten day span is insane.  He can’t afford it if he’s borrowing money to do it.
relationships,eugu1j7,t1_eugtlbx,1563814876.0,For the most part yes.

DeadBedrooms,es4yr3h,t3_c5rx15,1561597434.0,That’s probably what he would prefer I actually do end up doing that sometimes but it feels so much better when he does it for me not to mention I find masturbating in front of him awkward when he’s not really into it anymore.
DeadBedrooms,es449y7,t1_es434gk,1561576785.0,Exactly and it’s not something I feel really comfortable talking about with many ppl.
DeadBedrooms,es4432a,t1_es3pa7l,1561576671.0,It is such a shitty thing to do to someone and if I did that to him every time I’m sure he wouldn’t like it.  It’s crazy I’m the one initiating and getting turned on and he is the one who gets to finish and then rolls over and immediately passes out.  Doesn’t even bother him I’m sitting there frustrated.

DeadBedrooms,er8vvur,t3_c0xntz,1560612661.0,"It hurt to read this...I realized the same thing about my boyfriend, in 12 years he has never looked at me and said I’m beautiful.  When I mentioned it he said that I wouldn’t agree with him anyway and I’m always saying how I’m not happy with myself.  That is not even true he never even says it so how could I have disagreed?  I’m honestly very unhappy in the relationship we are rarely intimate and i deserve to be with someone who is attracted to me and so do you."
DeadBedrooms,eqql608,t3_bz5q4t,1560223910.0,I could have written this myself.  I’m so happy to hear he’s trying.  About a year ago my bf started being more affectionate after I told him I felt like he didn’t want me anymore and for a little while  it was a lot better but recently we haven’t been having as much sex again.  It doesn’t help that we are always arguing.  I am always the one to initiate sex and that is upsetting to me.  I do have a high sex drive but it’s like he isn’t interested at all and we used to have sex very day in the beginning.
