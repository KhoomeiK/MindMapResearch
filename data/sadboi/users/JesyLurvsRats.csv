I would say it is absolutely a power/control issue for most pedophiles. There's tons of documentation that they get off on the innocence, the naivety. 

There are slight stats that support victims becoming an abuser, but that is a highly spread false assumption. If victims of sexual abuse are able to get out from under their abuser they don't tend to become offenders. If we want to get out and away, then chances are we don't ever want another human to feel that kind pain and turmoil. We have a ton of unhealthy coping mechanisms, but sexual abuse concerning children isn't it. 

But this teeeeny tiny subset that's aware it's wrong, and are doing what they can to NOT be an offender? That's a curious circumstance and if we can actually help them???? That would be an amazing thing. My hopes aren't high, because the support to find out just isn't there and I am not exactly upset that reasonably we can't just slap a (mental) illness issue on this. That would fucking destroy so many communities. 

This is really a very, veeery small statistic of possible offenders reaching out and creating their own little support groups to keep each other accountable. It's an interesting concept, and I wish it could be addressed in some form for the people who recognize something is wrong. But alas, humans tend to be garbage.

And this particular article only focused on male offenders.

There's a whooooole ass group of women we need to fucking knock out in this as well. We've all seen female teachers on the news for having sex with students. Women ABSOLUTELY get away with more covert sexual abuse and grooming. We stupidly, as a society, seem to think a woman would *never* do this shit.

asexuality,fquxjp5,t3_gkz089,1589666056.0,"Fuck YES.

So I hit 23,and at that point I was just wanting to be happy. I identified as lesbian until then, and decided to explore if I was maybe bisexual. Well, two ex boyfriends and discovering asexuality a year later...

I have had 12 sexual partners over 15yrs. I can count on both hands any orgasm caused by someone other than me. I've done some weird shit I'm not proud of, and some stuff that was kinda fun.

Ultimately, though, I've been single and sexually inactive for almost 4yrs. I've doubled down on my closest friendships (all 4 of them haha) and made them a priority. They are my rocks, and I do my best to be the same for them. One is actually my former Dom, and he's  the only former partner who said ""Actually, this makes a lot of sense looking back."" everyone else had some awful shit to say. It was shocking to say the least

But my mental health has *drastically* improved. I've built myself a small net for emotional support, and honestly the only love I need from them is akin to my relationship with my older sister (my only full sibling). I don't need romance (I'm still battling with myself if I'm Aro or not, but I'm beginning to suspect that might be the case which is fine either way), and I am a very low libido person. So sex? Not a thing I have ever said or thought that I need. It frustrated a lot of former partners to the point a few of them got into my fb messages and texts because they were convinced I was cheating, then found irrelevant shit to be pissed about. I hardly feel the need to mastubate, and even then if I can't knock that out in less than five minutes I'm not interested in giving it a go. I know, I know. TMI. But fuck it. If we can't be frank and open here then what's the point?

At the end of the day, you know what you want and what you need out of a relationship. Being cautious is absolutely fine. Nobody wants to give someone the wrong impression when it comes to this stuff. It's just a tad bit more difficult for a-spec folx to clearly have boundaries that a prospective partner will not try to push or extract exceptions from.

Just be safe, be sane, be consensual. If anything you are pursuing doesn't fit those three, examine it thoroughly. You don't need to relax your boundaries for anyone, and if you do then you have every right to say no/stop at any and every point in time."

NuclearRevenge,fqutro2,t1_fqur9wz,1589664447.0,"I had a fucked up home life, early on I was a victim of 2 different men for sure. I'm fuzzy on if the third was a different person or a repeat, and I sadly know WAY too many women and girls who've suffered sexual abuse to degrees that even writers of Law & Order SVU couldn't conceive happening.

Now, here's where I'm conflicted. I dug into an upworthy article/interview that discussed a very small group of people who absolutely know that their predilection is WRONG. At the time, none of them had offended (if we are to take them at their word). One individual was a teenager who was the focus of the piece. I can't remember the name of the woman who's expertise was in pedophilia and therapy treatment for them, but with this small group they anecdotally came to the conclusion that between ages 9-12, they were exposed in some form or another to sex/porn involving their age group or at least appeared to be in their age group. The teen's story was tragically understandable; around 10yrs old his sexual curiosity was piqued and unfortunately it imprinted on him. But another catch? Literally NOBODY wants to put their name down as helping this kid evolve his sexual interests to match his age and maturity. He quite literally knew something wasn't right with his attraction model and *told his mom* because he was terrified of hurting a child. 

Which poses a curious question. Can we treat pedophilia, if we can get these people into serious therapy before they offend? If we can narrow it down to exposure to sexual content at a young age that imprints on them..... Can we change this with cognitive/behavioral therapy?? Possibly develop new therapies? 

But nobody (rightfully) wants to fund the research to find out. Rightfully, a lot of people are scared that it sets the precedent that ""they just can't help it"" or ""it's an illness"" or ""it's natural.""

AskReddit,fquhajl,t1_fqtwxpb,1589658959.0,"I always wondered about one of my classmates. Some days he was dressed fine, and then he'd like... Show up looking like a Christmas store threw up on him. I guess red/green blindness makes them both look kind of brown?? Which is neat, but probably not for a middle schooler in the 90s. I was definitely an outcast, so I kind of championed my fellow weirdos. I smashed a math book to the back of an asshole's head for snatching a drawing in slow process from the legally blind kid during algebra 1. Ooooooh that still gets my blood pressure up. I'm still not sure how I didn't get expelled. Two week in school suspension though. That was lame, but well worth it. Turns out if you're the crazy person in your class, they realize they need to leave you tf alone.

Ahhhhh, the good ol days."

OldSchoolCool,fqubwb8,t1_fqtv1zz,1589655968.0,"The most pissed off I've ever gotten a cop was telling him I found my bag of drugs on the ground outside of a liquor store. It was a negligible amount, just a misdemeanor. But fuuuuuck was that hilarious. Even if I were going to catch a felony, I would have given the same smartass answer. I've had my name tossed out by an ex, and definitely got picked up because of it. I wasn't even into the scene at that point, just a dabbler. Dumbest part was I hadn't even spoken to the bitch in over a year. That definitely chapped my ass. Still does, if I'm honest. 

Jail is fun with the right inmates, though. I didn't mind hanging around when I couldn't bail out. Learned new things every time!"

Dad and stepmom were so against us living together before being married that bf had to tell them to their faces that his immortal soul is not their problem.

My swimsuit nightmare was the clasp on my top BROKE. Because apparently some fucking genius thought, ""Oh, this main clasp for the bust? Pssssh plastic is totally fine."" I did not know this. I'm out on a damn boat with my then boyfriend and his pervy ass uncles (not to my face, but I have ears goddammit). I pull my shirt up and I'm wiggling my shoulders to get it off and all the sudden my bf is yelping and yanks my arms down. Too late, everyone saw my goddamn tits.

This did however give me an excellent excuse to not get in the water. I'm fine in a boat, I'm fine in water when I can stand and the water isn't above my neck. But tubing? I chewed like 5 Xanax for that shit. Instead I just drank a couple beers, not the smartest move with anxiety meds, but I am fully aware how that goes from 0-9000, and two bud lights weren't going to kill me. 

Boyfriend got high fives later I guess, for my awesome tits? Like, wtf. High five ME. THEY'RE MY BOOBS YOU FUCKS. AND Y'ALL GOT A FREE SHOW."

A friend and I were taking a late night walk down decommissioned (is that even the right word? Idfk) train tracks. She was trying to call someone back because her phone cut out. Well, I kept walking forward unaware that she had stopped to fiddle with the phone.

She fucking screams, because she didn't realize I kept walking, causing me to spin around and run back to her about 10ft, as she bursts out laughing immediately after her scream... And I'm screaming ""WHYYYYYYYY?????"" which just makes her laugh harder. I was legit in tears and so confused.

A 30yr old is still too old to be hitting on a teenager. That's called grooming and manipulation, you psycho. I don't give a fuck what was old to you or not. If you're so messed up that you're hitting on teens, who have the emotional depth of a dry puddle and about the same level of maturity as a wet one, then there's clearly something wrong with you for not being able to date within your age group."

AskReddit,fqsuq2j,t1_fqs8mm9,1589619528.0,"When my brain decided to completely fucking break in 2017, I was regularly hitting 5/6 days awake in a row and that's when I'd start to lose it. I was irrationally emotional, hallucinating faces in the folds of fabric. The complete surrealism and feeling like I was barely in my own body was a trip and a half. 

This went on for 10 months. Doctors refused to believe me that I wasn't on drugs (meth) until my current shrink. I was ready to die, I won't even lie. I took seven 20mg ambian in one go and I didn't even yawn. I took 200mg of melatonin and it did nothing. I was doing reckless shit like that at least twice a month, sometimes more, just to see if I'd get any relief. And so I finally told my new (at the time) shrink about the ambian and he just stared at me horrified and speechless for a good 10+ seconds before he loaded me up with serequel. I've tried to lower my dose on my own, but it doesn't work unless I've already hit the 36-48hr mark of being up and am already primed with extreme exhaustion. 

All I know is that I am not strong enough to go through that again. I absolutely will end up taking my own life. That sounds fucked and bleak, but it is what it is. I'm already not a fan of existing, I don't need to endlessly suffer like that ever again.

Its interesting that you were able to pull this off, I'm assuming, sober?"
