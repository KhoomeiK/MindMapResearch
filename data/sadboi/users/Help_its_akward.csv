It makes me incredibly happy that you would look to educate yourself, I think that youre probably a kind person. I'm really not a writer so I dont know how much I can help, but I am transmasc.

So for the questions:
1. Mark will probably dealing with dysphoria. Psychical in terms of his body, and social in terms of how others perceive and treat him. I dont really know how to explain dysphoria except for saying it feels like absolute shit. Also, in history, trans people were extraordinarily secretive if they were stealth (passing as cis) because if the wider society found out, they would be rejected.

2. People can do physical activity while binding, if they go a size up/losen their binds. Depending on a persons chest size than it might become noticeable. Also binding for more that 8 consecutive hours can cause long term damage and pain. Amateur binding can cause broken ribs. Swimming is difficult because the binds get heavy and are hard to put on/take off when wet, buts its not impossible. 

3. I like that idea! Its not uncommon for us to put ourselves in uncomfortable situations to try to not out ourselves lol. 


4. Almost all of the trans people I know, including myself, are activists. When you personally experience injustice, it makes it very hard to ignore it. Systematic and social inequality effects a lot of groups. And when you're one of those groups you help the others. 


5. I dont think theres any question you should've asks, I think its great you asked any at all. A question I have that I'm still unclear on is, do his friends know he's trans?

Also btw with voice training people can make their voices deeper. My biggest advice is to just treat Mark like any other character, while not erasing his transness. Sometimes I see writers make a spectacle out of their trans character, and while I appreciate the effort, it doesn't feel great. If you have any more questions feel free to ask em!

This one is the hardest but also can be the most fun. You can try out different labels/pronouns and refer to yourself in your head. Or of you have supportive friends, you can ask them to. Think about what you want to look and be like the future, and how that relates to you expression and gender. 

>Is there any professional who can help me with this? Is there a possibility talking to a professional can worsen my questioning?

Yes there are gender therapists! And to the worry that it would worsen your questioning, I don't think that would happen. I'm not an expert on OCD so I dont know how that would play out, but I'm sure the therapist would help.

>Is there any possibility all of this can keep constantly changing thought all my life, and so I'll never truly be able to feel stable?

Things might keep changing, and they might not. If they do, then embrace it, fluid identities exist. If they dont, thats also great. Either way you'll figure yourself out. Wish you luck!"

So for the first point, as a general rule of thumb dont ask a trans person about their agab. Its abrasive and can be dysphoria inducing. If a trans person offers that info up, than thats fine of course! But treat the information with the appropriate amount of respect. 

Next, gender and sexuality. Gender and sexuality are not the same, and while they do work with eachother, there's is no reason currently to think they are linked.

AskLGBT,fn0vrxl,t1_fmzex8w,1586549703.0,"Interesting!

I'm a bit confused about your thought process, so imma just go over the basics. Sex ≠ Gender ≠ gender expression. Sex is your physical characteristics, what you were assigned at birth. Gender is what you are internally. And gender expression is how you dress an shit. 

>when people say they identify as a woman because they like feminine stuff or being feminine or looking feminine I always see people saying ""well that's not what makes a woman"". And it ... feels right to think that way, you know? But then, what is gender identity??

Ok this might not be the answer you want but, gender is simply what you are. I dont know how to explain other than it is what you identify as. I know that im nonbinary because when I think about my gender, that is what I am. And when I think about being a man or a women I get extremely uncomfortable and unhappy. Some trans people are put in situations where they need to justify their gender, which is when they say its because they like fem stuff or whatever, because thats what a lot of cis people understand gender to be.

So when you say you ""don't get what transgender is supposed to mean"" it means someones gender doesnt match with their birth sex. So yes a cis man can dress however the fuck he wants and not be trans because thats just how he likes to express himself, and his gender identity still a man. But a trans women is not and can not be just a feminine man, because she simply isnt a man. It would be false to call her that. Also saying that identifying as trans ""is just that tiny step of saying you identify as a woman"" really is not accurate to peoples experiences, and honestly trivializes it.

queer,fm8xojh,t3_fthcr0,1585857943.0,"Unfortunately no one else besides you can figure out your gender. But as a nb person hopefully I can help at least a little. 

Im sure you already know but gender =/= gender expression. So you can dress however the fuck you want and dont have to worry. That said, if its less about presenting masc and more about being masc, that could tell you something. 

When you say that it bothers you when people call you ""ma'am"" I relate to that a lot lmao. Is it because it feels like they're incorrect when they call you ma'am?

My best advice I guess is to think through the motivation behind your feelings. Like try to figure out why do you feel the way you do. Also try on labels. Unfortunately people can be very unkind in publicly figuring yourself out, but quarantine could give you a chance to do it on a personal level. Try on labels/pronous in your head. Refer to yourself in different ways when you think about yourself. 

I don't know if anything I just wrote is the least bit helpful, but I genuinely wish you the best!"

I'm friends with some cis women who also dont like male coded slang words, so it really is a personal thing. Hope this helps, you seem very kind!"

Nonbinaryteens,fm6cxkj,t3_ft8hyh,1585791304.0,"Unfortunately ""how would I know what I am exactly?"" is smth only you can answer. But to help out, try imagining yourself in the future, be it 5yrs from now or 30. In your imagination what do you look like? Are you a woman? Someone androgynous?"
