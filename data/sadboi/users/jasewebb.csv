the1975,fr334jk,t3_gmbtp3,1589848981.0,I used to work at target the UPC wont allow it to be sold BUT grab the CD and another CD that you can buy and bring them both to self checkout. Scan the other CD and leave it behind taking just the 1975 CD home with you. Then you arent technically stealing. ;-)

depression,f91u22x,t3_e349k2,1575001284.0,"I know I cannot convince you not to kill yourself. I wont tell you any of that ""its selfish"" bullshit because it's not. You shouldn't be forced to live a life where you are suffering. I've thought of suicide at times but dont have the guts to go through with it. Medication has me a bit more stabilized lately and has made my quality of life a bit better. Have you tried every other Avenue? Suicide should only be last resort. You still have other options. Start a new life. Move away. Reinvent yourself. Kill yourself without killing yourself. Kill the you inside that you hate and that is suffering. If nothing else works then you deserve to make the call that you want out. I just hope you can see past this dark shadow that is depression. There are other paths to take other than death. If all else fails just know that I, some no one on the internet who has been as depressed and hopeless as you does care that your alive. I care about you man and I dont know you. I feel how caring you are of others. That's fucking rare. Life can be beautiful dont let this depression monster trick you. Love you man."

depression,etw8anw,t3_cdp4gi,1563257875.0,I relate soooooo much. Life has become pointless. Going to work every day to deal with bullshit and just getting 2 days off but too tired and depressed to do anything and start the week over again. Every day before work I get so anxious and sick to my stomach I just wish life would end. Not that i want to die but the way life has been working for me isn't worth it.
