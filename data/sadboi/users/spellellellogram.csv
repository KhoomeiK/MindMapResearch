BipolarReddit,fpcby8s,t1_fpbxwc6,1588494799.0,"I'm so sorry this happened to you. I had a similar situation with an employer calling me into the office to discuss my attendance (which I admit had been poor because I was going through a depressive episode) and I'm fairly certain someone had snooped through my files because she was grilling me to tell her why I was absent and strongly hinting that I should tell her if I had any mental health issues. I refused to disclose anything because I wasn't comfortable with the way she was pressuring me. I was in that office for 3 hours and she had me write an essay about how I would improve my performance as if I was in middle school and she legit made me rewrite it like 3 times and she still wasn't happy.

 I ended up quitting after she told me I wasn't a responsible employee for the fifteenth time and it made me spiral into the worst depressive episode of my life to date. It was almost a whole year before I felt like I could actually be a person again. 

Since then I disclose to employers that I have a disability but I don't tell them it's bipolar disorder and cptsd, only that I do not require accommodations at this time but that I will try to provide ample warning if I do. I have only needed accommodations once regarding my disabilities and my workplace did not ask for details, just a brief description of the accommodations I needed."

I'm currently trying to move up into a managerial role in a similar environment and keep getting passed over because of bipolar related stress and personal issues that have popped up at the most inopportune times.

CPTSD,fmllukq,t1_fml9on6,1586188928.0,">I guess itâ€™s all on the shoulders of the abused and neglected kids to know how to ask for help.

I've been thinking about this alot lately, about how I didn't know how to ask for help as a child because I grew up in a situation where asking for help was punished. I struggled especially during my middle school and high school years when I hit puberty and the type of abuse changed. I remember feeling like I was screaming out for help in the only way I knew how - drawing pictures of self harm and abuse on my schoolwork. I was desperate for a teacher to ask if I was okay but no one ever did and I didnt get any help until I was in my early twenties. Why is the impetus to ask for help put on the children who have been trained to NEVER ask for help?"

I've seen almost this exact scenario play out when my best friend's father died. He had a large family that they visited once every year or so but they made a big fuss about trying to exclude my friend from the funeral and services because she was not biologically his daughter, despite being raised by the man since birth. People showed up who she had never even met in 21 years and they really thought their grief over his death was greater than hers. Death brings out the worst in people sometimes."

bipolar,fg7y7m5,t3_ex7ua9,1580604529.0,"Recently transitioned from an office/analytical role to an operational/leadership role at my workplace. I've always maintained a friendly (sometimes bubbly) attitude at work due in part to the fact that I was cooped up in a cubicle for a large portion of my day. Being out and about now, leading a team and dealing with other department leads, having to be constantly on call and keeping up the ready-to-help attitude day in day out for over 10 hours a day leaves me drained and exhausted and seriously considering if its worth getting out of bed every morning.

But - at the end of the day - I love my job. It took me a long time to find my place, even within this company. I bounced around for years from workplace to workplace, never staying longer than a year and that itself did a lot of damage to my self esteem which only made it harder to find jobs and stay at it. I've been a cook, a pre-k teacher, a paraprofessional, a cookie delivery person, housekeeper, cashier, tutor and nothing ever really stuck until I started working with my current company which has excellent health benefits starting day 1.

 I got my meds in order which allowed me to make the professional goals I wanted and now I'm in a place where, even when it's emotionally exhausting, I can end every day happy that I forced myself out of bed every morning.

TLDR; therapy/meds to get myself able to work in combination with a job I enjoy make that emotional exhaustion bearable"

You can order a book that's published through Amazon and the book will be made and shipped from the Amazon Warehouse. You could even publish your own books if you wanted to - a lot of people have published some odd things through Amazons BOD service.

BipolarReddit,ez1fb3w,t1_ez16ne5,1567647459.0,The first doctor to prescribe me trileptal said that it's theorized that the reason it works is because the brain is actually having tiny seizures that the trileptal regulates. When people ask why I tick the 'disability' box on paperwork they are 1000% more understanding if I say I have a chronic brain disorder where my brain is just having tiny seizures throughout the day than if I mention having bipolar disorder. Especially when I follow up with the fact that as long as I take my prescribed medication everything is fine. Somehow they take me more seriously with the one disorder than the other (even though it's the exact same thing!).
AmItheAsshole,ev5pm54,t1_ev5dug3,1564237155.0,"How did you come to that conclusion? OP stated that they've always spoken to their mom in Japanese only - do you realize how difficult it is to change that suddenly?

I am from a bilingual family and grew up speaking only Spanish to my parents. They know English (now) but on the rare occasions that I visit I still only speak in Spanish to them. It's a comfort thing, and a sign of respect, as well as a good chance to practice my Spanish - which has only gotten worse and worse since I moved out of their home. I live in California and opportunities to speak Spanish are a lot more common than Japanese in Australia but even so I still don't get a chance to really speak Spanish on a day-to-day basis. Even when I bring my SO (who doesn't speak Spanish) I speak to to them as I normally would and then translate for him to keep him in the loop. He would never ask me to speak to them in English for his sake because he understands that it's our culture and it would be an awkward change for all of us.

OP I'd say you are NTA, especially since there IS English conversation happening and your SD chooses to get upset about the Japanese. He sounds like a jerk but if he's that upset by it your mom should translate for him or he should learn Japanese."
BipolarReddit,euxbzv7,t1_euw8pb2,1564085768.0,"This is a GREAT plan. Reach out to the  CC company, try to get the debt consolidated, but whatever you do DON'T ignore it. I was in the exact same boat and couldn't make the calls to try to work something out while I was low so they served some papers to my parents (who I'm low to no contact with) and now I'm getting my wages garnished. I know if I had been able to reach out after the fact they might have set me up on a payment plan or possibly settled for less than the total debt, but I was moving house every few months and fluctuating wildly between manic and depressed for a couple years so I completely put it out of my mind. One day I noticed my paycheck was a couple hundred dollars short and lo and behold: garnishment.

 I know it's hard, but they will definitely work with you if you explain the situation and tell them what you can afford."

AmItheAsshole,eonm5va,t3_bsivc4,1558715970.0,"NTA. Tom's stepmom is upset that you've become his surrogate mom after his own mom passed away but he's probably known you longer and he's able to control how much distance to put between his memories of his mom and the mom type things you've been doing for him. His stepmom just moved into his house to take over as his new mom and he probably resents that.

That being said, I understand why the stepmom was hurt. I'm only saying she's the asshole in this situation because she should have seen this as a wake up call that she needs to work on her relationship with Tom. Instead she shifted the blame to you and took the time to go tell you off for being a good mom. Don't let her rattle you. 

It sounds like you're a great mom so keep doing what you're doing. If your relationship with Tom is the kind where you can give him some gentle advice, maybe tell him about the stepmom seeing the Mother's Day present and being hurt that the flowers weren't for her. Let him know you'll always be there for him but that it would mean a lot to Stepmom if he put in a little effort with her. As long as Stepmom isn't a total monster, a little effort will go a long way towards building a stronger relationship with this person who will presumably be in his life for a while.

Good luck OP!"
