Maybe your mom feels like she's losing her bestfriend too. As a parent I know that you don't want any harm to come to your child.  You want to protect them. She may be afraid of what could happen to you.She may be confused by all this. Confused about  gender and sexuality.  You get to live your authentic life, no matter what. Do you have allies for support? Is there a LGBTQ  center near where you live? I hope you can find positive support in your community. It truly is a remarkable time, its becoming easier to transition and society is much more accepting. Keep looking towards your future and keep being you."
