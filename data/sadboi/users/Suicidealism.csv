Comedy is different. Comedy is almost entirely predicated upon culture, and Japanese comedic norms are different than American ones ATM.

No, of course not. I still think they're funny, but that's beside the point. Humor changes, and it takes a long time to get used to the admittedly embarrassing brand of anime humor.

Celebrities are THE most egotistical people in the world ninety percent of the time, and as a result they don't need to be interesting. They're the most boring, milquetoast people on earth (especially comedians - to have a successful comedy career, you have to appeal to every sense of humor in the audience because you can't keep making the same people laugh for hours straight - laughing that long is tiring - and therefore you have to hit different parts of the crowd with different jokes rather than being actually funny to one type of person, whereas friends are personally connected to you. That's why comedians do better on podcasts than shows). Even interesting celebrities can't be personally attached to you, because they could literally dispose of you at any time. They have thousands of other people lined up.

But that's just my opinion.

What really ruins the mystery is the scraping sounds."
