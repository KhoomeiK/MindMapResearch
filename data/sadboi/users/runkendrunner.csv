thesopranos,fqzcymf,t3_gl3hlg,1589764763.0,"Honestly, that scene is one of the most depressing in the entire series to me. 

The whole back half of Season 6 shows how those closest to Tony died/had their relationships changed dramatically. He's frustrated about his losing streak and takes Hesch's justified ask about the money and makes a whole big show out of it because he's that thin skinned and functioning terribly at this point. He feels like Hesch is showing his superiority and just fights back, probably destroying their friendship.

I said this in another thread but Hesch was almost a father figure at times. It makes sense that Tony would ""rebel"" when being asked to do something as a result. He feels hurt...but also out of control. His callousness in that scene shows he's exerting his authority, effectively burning the bridge. I can't imagine he'd want - or even be able - to go back to a friendly relationship at that point since he'll always remember how he was ""wronged."" 

It's sad to see him do this."

thesopranos,fqzavd8,t3_glmeg8,1589763517.0,"I just finished a rewatch. I think it's kind of murky in that she NEEDED to let him go, but the manner in which she did it wasn't well thought out. 

With talk therapy, there is only so much you can do for trauma. Particularly developmental trauma which Tony has....a lot of. And as they discussed, he's a cluster B personality (narcissist or sociopath) which means she was helping him be a better criminal. Hell, they touch on this in the first season when he takes the book on Eldercare and applies it to his relationship with Junior. 

Unfortunately, I think Tony ripping the page from the magazine was the straw that broke the camel's back for her. While she was probably figuring out how to dump him as a patient, I don't think she intended to do it that day because ethically she'd need to refer him to someone since he was in crisis. While she brought up the possibility of a referral she ends up rushing the entire conversation to get him out of there. Justified or not, it felt rushed and uncharacteristically unprofessional. 

Frankly, the whole thing fits into Tony's final arc though. A lot of the people he felt like he could trust died. But his last interaction with Melfi seemed similar to his last interaction with Hesch in a way. His actions effectively destroyed both those relationships too. He let Hesch's completely justified request to get a partial payment on his loan get to his head and acted liked a petulant child, becoming cold and callous when he finally did what he was supposed to. Hesch was a father figure to Tony at times, and he actively destroyed it. And frankly with all of Melfi's work in helping Tony process the damage Livia did...it's not surprising that he'd consistently act petulant and ""misbehave"" when called out. Thin skinned and controlling to the end. He's miserable, but despite being dumped by Melfi he rationalized it as his choice. 

The more I think about it, I honestly can't blame her for ending things the way she did."

Rewatching these it's weird how I'd forgotten how frequently he slipped into self-deprecating humor, particularly when he was uncomfortable. He also was dismissive about his own traumatic experiences. I think it's in Medium Raw where he casually mentions in regard to Beirut how it wasn't ""as bad"" as what others experience, which is a typical reaction by folks who've not processed trauma (or with lingering PTSD). Trauma is trauma, and the fact that society teaches us to compare ourselves to others is part of the reason why so many folks struggle like this.

Dark humor and committing yourself to helping/understanding others is a great way to cope, but if you're not able to process the underlying issues and understand where it's coming from it it'll only get you so far.

At the risk of getting into personal, I've dealt with depression with suicidal ideation my entire life and it's a large part of why Bourdain's writing has always spoke to me. He'd openly written about feeling suicidal (It's in Medium Raw and curiously, wrote a similar scene a decade before in his novel Going Bamboo) and frequently made cracks about killing himself throughout No Reservations. I found an article a psychologist counted \*19\* throw away ""jokes"" he made about hanging himself over the years. Viewing pain through humor is a way to avoid thinking about it.

Anyhow, I mention this because I've been dealing with severe depression and suicidal thoughts for some months and I've been watching a lot of his shows/reading a lot of his books. ""Seeing"" so much of what he openly said over the years has helped me process quite a bit because it absolutely breaks my heart to see how someone so empathetic and kind to people had this belief that he was fundamentally flawed. 

I mentioned this in another thread, but the Buenos Aires Parts Unknown is particularly tough to watch in retrospect when he calls himself a narcissist and insists there is ""nothing to be done."" I think at the time a lot of folks viewed these ""sessions"" as tongue and cheek, but it's very clear how honest he's being and the fact that he's convinced that he can't be ""helped"" is what is so tough to see. I know I'd believed these things about myself for years and it's taken a lot of work to even be partially OK with the idea that maybe I'm not just fundamentally messed up. And it's really hard to do, and for years I was good at distracting myself with anything and everything to avoid thinking about it. Something he was good at too. Until he wasn't. 

I hate that I see it so clearly, because if he'd been able to view himself with even a bit of the compassion he had for everyone else perhaps he'd still be with us.  :("
AnthonyBourdain,fqeg3i5,t1_fqefef5,1589306974.0,"I just rewatched that episode and it feels like a very slickly produced cry for help.

The DSM criteria for ADHD were a bit fuzzier when that was filmed so I get why they were reluctant - but they just shut down the conversation. If they'd taken the time to talk further with the psychologist or gotten another opinion, maybe they could have worked with the school to help him manage.

ADHD is neurological and NOT treating it can exacerbate depression, which they knew even THEN he may be prone to. (Source: My parents did the exact same thing to me!) The sad thing is that Carmela DID educate herself. But Tony's so horrified at the prospects of passing it on in any way that he can't face it and Carmela follows suit.

thisisus,fo92o9b,t1_fo82z6s,1587609171.0,Exactly! I always tell people who aren't quite sure about watching TIU that everything ends up being far more complex than it seems at first. Everything about Kevin and Randall and their relationship is a perfect example of that.
thisisus,fo7v88f,t1_fo1phfx,1587585119.0,"Yes!

It makes sense that that the fear of failure/disappointing others helped make Randall successful. That same believe about Kevin meant he was dismissed from the start. 

Teenage Kevin's resentment comes out because he rightly felt pushed aside, and it's why makes the ""replaced by a Black guy again"" comment to Randall when Morris Chestnut becomes the new Manny. As much as it sounds cruel, when Kevin points out the dysfunction at family therapy, Randall dismisses Kevin's feelings entirely just as he dismisses all of Kevin's choices. Kevin still ends up the black sheep; he's accused of being selfish. As much as he tries, he's still ""high maintenance"" Kevin.

Sadly, Randall's fear of failure runs soooo deep he CAN'T consider any other possibilities other than the narrative he's already established. Being dishonest with his therapist isn't going to help him. He clearly believes he's doing the right thing but the fact that Randall can't see the harm he's doing has been a constant theme from the pilot episode. Likewise, Kevin can't see where he's done good for others which is precisely why Kate tells him she wishes he could have compassion for himself. 

The whole situation is sad and shows how even loving parents can say things that impact their children for life."
thisisus,fo7tdca,t1_fo5iq4b,1587584213.0,"Exactly. 

I also think they've got different internal battles going on. 

Randall has always wrestled with his identity as a black man growing up with a white family, something further complicated by his brain chemistry. Those of us prone to anxiety and panic attacks have a nervous system that works a little differently and perfectionism (academically, professionally, people pleasing, over committing)  is often a coping tactic. It's a battle, and one he's struggled to acknowledge his whole life. He always feels like he has to prove something, and he never feels like he's doing enough which ironically blinds him to how he can hurt those around him. 

Kevin is kind of fascinating since the writers have gone out of their way to show he's been more insightful than he's gotten credit for. He's been bothered by existential questions since he was a kid. But because he had social skills and less obvious emotional problems, he experienced emotional neglect in that area leading to depression he doesn't have the tools to recognize. He's self-medicated his entire life (alcohol, self-destructive behavior, and - funny enough - people pleasing in a different way) and hates himself for it and the success he's achieved in spite of it. He just feels EMPTY. 

The irony is clearly that these two have more in common right now than they recognize. Randall has taken on extra responsibility his entire life and resents a challenge. Kevin resents being seen as a screw up and wants to make how much he truly cares known. Neither one can clearly articulate this since they're both so good at getting by in spite of it. Frankly, neither one has much self-esteem, they're both just skilled at faking it. It's also why they clash so badly. (And frankly, probably contributes to Kate's tendency to wait for cues from others to react. ""Number 2"" always been trapped in the middle of this lifelong clash.)

It's honestly one of the more fascinating and real relationships on TV right now and they both have a lot to accept and process before having a healthy relationship with each other. As someone fascinated by their individual paths, I hope they can get there."

Still, she's done it within the confines of the law for so long that it makes sense she's attracted to (apologies in advance) *breaking bad* like a moth to flame. She's just so BORED. 

I mean now that you say it, her fantasizing about the ""good"" she could do with the money while destroying Howard's career - completely ignoring the fact that her now husband has already talked to her about buying a  house - really does feel like she's slinking closer to ""I'm doing this for my family,"" doesn't it? It's not surprising Jimmy is horrified. He's traumatized and scared after realizing he could have lost the one person he truly cares about and is petrified that something bad could happen.

Well put. Kim hates the establishment as much as Jimmy does, isn't self-loathing like he is. She's better at compartmentalizing but still processing her feelings, which Jimmy can't (and won't let himself) do. 

The most interesting part is that her way of ""winning"" was to play along. It's clear a lot of her drive comes from growing up poor, but just as much of it comes from the satisfaction of beating sexist and smug men at their own game. But at the same time, she made a ton of money and still lives in the same condo. She wears nicer clothes but nothing extravagant like Lydia and her Loubitons. She was happy with success until she wasn't....trying anymore. She just got bored and made the conscious decision to stop playing along while still finding a way to be ""good."" She's ""slipping Kimmy"" that way. She can beat him at his own game precisely because she's figured out how to process and compartmentalize her feelings and turn them into action. 

Meanwhile, the more Jimmy sinks into Saul - a place he can't reach since he's dealing with some serious PTSD - the more difficult it will be to feel anything at all. As much as he can brag about lightening bolts shooting out of his fingers, he can't get his anger to work for him. Especially now. He's just drained and scared.

For example, I'm not sure how old you were when you were diagnosed/started treatment, but despite being diagnosed at as a kid myself I didn't start treatment until I was in my 30s. It was a big deal for me to get some context around things and frankly, I lost a few friends that told me ""buying into it"" made me ""dramatic.""

Bingo. And social learning plays a big role; we learn a lot about ourselves from watching and understanding others. 

And I \*do\* think that the skills we gain from adjusting to demands at work/social situations, etc give us a perspective on things NT folks don't have.

I have co-morbidities which makes it difficult to pin down exactly WHY certain things occur. I actually made a ven diagram to get a better grasp on my own triggers. Interestingly enough, I think the poor emotional regulation and issues with executive function are my biggest problems - both of which stem from ADHD.

poshmark,fnbfvul,t3_g0mgfj,1586814811.0,"My biggest frustration with Poshmark is that for all the sharing, etc - you can't actually see how many people LOOK at your listing. It's false engagement since people just randomly share which doesn't mean anyone will even look at the listing unless they're specifically looking for that item. While careful keyword use can get you into the showrooms/higher in listings, unless everything you have is in demand it might sit for ages and without ACTUAL metrics you have no idea how something is actually doing.

Here is the TLDR part:

Nothing I have is really moving anywhere at the moment, but at least I can see on eBay/Mercari no one is actually looking at the listings. I had several items from supposed ""Bolo"" brands like Cabi, Laundry by Shelli Segal, Trina Turk, and Free People that had less than a dozen eyes on it TOTAL after being posted and relisted multiple times over a period of 3 moths on all three platforms so I ultimately pulled them in favor of local consignment/Crossroads/ThredUp which seems like the right choice.

A couple of them had a like or two on posh, but after looking closely I noticed they came from the kind of people who liked like...15 things in my closet randomly. While I suspect these particular pieces may have just been a bit too basic to attract attention, without seeing the numbers from Posh I have no idea if things were any different since I'd written descriptions based on what I saw people were searching for. Maybe I'm splitting hairs, but the marketing/human behavior focused part of my brain wants to know.

I know I think about things differently and can't adopt the perspective most can,  but I get so lost in my own head that the anxiety over not being able to produce keeps me from doing a damn thing. Theoretically, I'm a good writer, but between being able to type fast and the lack of patience I have for editing my own work it sure as hell doesn't show. 

I also think famous creative folks who are ADHD managed to develop a lot of tools through sheer willpower to make it work. For example, I always suspected the late Anthony Bourdain was ADHD (his writing drew a lot of seemingly weird connections that I think make more sense to ND folks...probably why nobody has been able to duplicate his voice) and he spoke a LOT of how being super organized and over committing to the point that he couldn't stop is what helped him pull it off. I know I've managed to pull off this strategy for long periods of time, but it has always resulted in burn out.

I think the bottom line is the creative process is always tough, but for us it's generally even tougher since it's often harder for us to access the tools when we need them.

This is so well said. The ""normies"" suddenly feel removed from their friends and socializing, but still have 0 compassion for those of us who feel this way every day of our lives. Those who have mocked us, called us depressing or dramatic, purposely cut us out or ignored us...we still mean nothing to them. We never have, we never will.

The funny thing is you're right - it IS a break. I'd been struggling with SI for months after trauma related to harassment at my work. I asked a couple people I trusted for help and advice about what was happening and was told I sounded ""desperate"" when I was, in fact, desperate for help based on what was happening to me. There was no support, no empathy. Supposed friends stopped talking to me. I stopped trying and have been hiding for months.

And now it does feel like a break because I no longer have to think about the rage and misery that comes from knowing how little people care about me. Isolation takes away the pressure and weirdly takes the edge off.

It's like nobody every disappointed them or forgot them and I have NO idea what it feels like to experience unconditional love/acceptance like that. Why do I have to feel stressed/terrible about something yearly that everyone else loves?

The sad thing is I hit a milestone birthday last year and actually told people about it which I never, ever, ever do. I had a random idea for an event and honestly, they mocked me for it. It just reinforced the fact that I can't ever tell people anything about myself or they'll just disappoint me. The worst part is I just feel humiliated about the whole thing.

BipolarReddit,fn7p5uu,t3_g01e87,1586724820.0,"It is all I'm on currently, and it's been super effective.

The TLDR version: 

I recently went through a traumatic event and long story short, I had all my medication changed around. My depression was particularly severe, and Lamictal was the only thing that leveled me out. However, it's probably notable that the effectiveness of Lamictal actually led to me being \*rediagnosed\* as Bipolar II since we'd assumed MDD stemmed from ADHD/PTSD. I've only had mixed episodes and the Lamictal was a last-ditch effort since I'd been actively suicidal (SI with a LOT of intrusive thoughts) for months.

We've increased the dose from 50mg to 150mg and It's evened out the depression and mood swings A LOT. I feel a little low key depressed, but it is manageable and it's been all I've taken since late last year. I've only slipped when triggered (PTSD involves an active legal situation involving said trauma), and it's been a little easier to get out of the dark place where SI reappears since I'm better able to recognize it.

The only downside is it really only treats the depression and we have to bring back a stimulant to treat the ADHD now that my general mood has stabilized. Co-morbidities are tricky. :-/"

If you're looking for therapists, I'll note that when it comes to unraveling triggers, EMDR has been helpful for me. But it doesn't work for a lot of folks with CPTSD. I found an LMFT who was well versed at EMDR who is able to explore single triggers at a time which is probably critical if you're dealing with complex trauma.
