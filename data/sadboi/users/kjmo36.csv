There are good days and bad days for me but I always try to remind myself that the right thing will come along at the right time."

Anxiety,fppysxk,t3_geiyn7,1588811785.0,"This is my whole life. This is why I don’t have hobbies, won’t date, don’t make positive life choices (I.e. work out), don’t know what I want to do for a career, etc.
I’m really trying to work on it though!!"
ADHD,fppyc41,t1_fppxl0n,1588811528.0,I also think that by saying only people struggling in school should be on meds perpetuates the stereotype of people claiming they have ADHD symptoms so they can get meds just to pass a test/write a paper/pull and all-nighter/sell to other students who want the same things. This happens and it’s another reason I think I was blown off by my doctor. I’m assuming he though because I was in college I was getting the meds as a side hustle not because I actually need them (even though I had been diagnosed years prior)!! There are other reasons to be on medication.
ADHD,fppxl0n,t3_gel0mv,1588811114.0,I was on medication for a bit in high school (even though I had good grades/did fine) but got off of them part way through my junior year because I had moved across the country and was struggling with a sleep schedule and emotions so I though it’d be best to get off them. Fast forward to my sophomore year of college I talked to my doctor about getting back on them and he immediately said no because I had gotten a 4.0...this was 4 years ago and I didn’t think much of it because I didn’t really understand my ADHD until about a year ago when I started really doing some research. Now looking back this really upsets me because that’s not all that ADHD is about and meds probably really would have helped my junior and senior year when I was working 3 jobs while going to school full time and was struggling with a lot of it (this is what prompted the research).
AskWomen,fowuxzz,t1_fowb09l,1588127696.0,"Hi! I’ve thought about getting my project management certification but don’t know where to begin! Some say I should just go for my mba if I want more school. If you don’t mind, what was your first degree in and what do you do for work?"
minimalism,fovt0d8,t1_fou8tht,1588107008.0,I do this with things I want and need. I always have a running list to look over and if something pops in my head that I might want or need then I add it to the list to remember. I can sit with it and determine if it’s something that would actually add value to my life. If it’s something I think about a lot or find myself needing then I might look into purchasing it. It’s also helpful for birthdays and holidays if people need gift ideas for you and if I do get an urge to spend/shop I go to the list of things I was already thinking about getting rather than buying stuff that just catches my eye.

AmeriCorps,fncye9q,t1_fncjtk0,1586851608.0,"I am in a very similar situation. I’ve been debating since the began and now I’m over halfway through so I’m going to just stick it out but those three things you just mentioned are EXACTLY what I think about! When I talk to other people they say the first two probably won’t even happen and when I think about the education award I just think about the money I could make if I had a real income instead and I realize that’s it wouldn’t be worth the misery to stick it out. I’ve put too much time in to quit now but if you really aren’t enjoying yourself then find something that makes you happy before you waste any more time (I felt it was a waste of time, but not sure if you feel the same way)."
