GrowingMarijuana,fnlpsrx,t3_g2hifh,1587057641.0,You’re def over watering !!! Transfer plants to new containers also. I normally water Mather once or twice a week.
GrowingMarijuana,fnlm4xg,t3_g2ihfd,1587055884.0,Best way to check is the crystals. Use a magnifying glass of 30x. If they are smokey white and some are amber at the top. You good ! Only way to really tell is by the crystals.
GrowingMarijuana,fmyhg5e,t1_fmxz85n,1586486263.0,"Thanks man, first time growing ever. It’s pretty lit honestly."
GrowingMarijuana,fmyfuoy,t1_fmwtp6z,1586485174.0,I moved it into a shaded corner that gets less light. Hoping that’ll help some way.
GrowingMarijuana,fmyemua,t1_fmwsj55,1586484366.0,Yeah I don’t have that either. It’s just nice and green in the middle with nice crystals. Idk what it is. Zipped a piece took it apart. It’s nice.
GrowingMarijuana,fmwsg3s,t1_fmwcgn3,1586452218.0,It’s been growing since September.
GrowingMarijuana,fmwoetx,t1_fmwgq50,1586450188.0,"I’ve taken other buds apart and there is nothing inside. No fuzzy white in the dense part, no bugs."
GrowingMarijuana,fmwluin,t1_fmwcgn3,1586448899.0,I’m located in So Flo. I thought the same thing. It hasn’t gotten dense in the upper colas.
GrowingCannabis,fmw8dbx,t1_fmw1jir,1586441692.0,How do you post more photos ?
GrowingCannabis,fmvblx2,t3_fxmtnu,1586411576.0,"So I started this plant in September time. Didn’t keep track when the flowering stage started, probably in the 6 weeks mark maybe 8. Had issues with spider mites. Used neem oil on branches and around the pot base. Tried to keep away from buds (read of ruining taste in final flower stage). Then I noticed some of the bud has changed to a darker tone. Thinking bud rot but not sure, and I’m thinking of starting to harvest next week. Any thoughts ?"
GrowingCannabis,fmvah1h,t3_fvecey,1586410602.0,Honestly buddy bushy is normally. Bushy is normally a side of indica. Short and fat. Though photos would be AMAZING and make sure you’re trimming and keeping that air flow
Anxiety,f4s5zb0,t1_f3bgxgd,1571774738.0,Thanks a bunch! Means a lot honestly!
depression,f3bblqo,t3_del3c8,1570806458.0,"I hate when people do this. Family, friends, boyfriend/girlfriend. 

Sadly I have the same issue. Dad will say “oh get over it” or he will say “I deal with it too, you just gotta get over it. It’s not that serious”. People who don’t deal with longing sadness, depression, loneliness, and anxiety have no idea, but they swear they do. 

I’m sorry you went through this. *hug* it’ll get better when you remove yourself from toxic people"
