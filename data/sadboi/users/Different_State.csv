So I am considering all the options there are where I could live comfortably to enjoy some hobbies and not just work until I die but where also people have closer to each other, support each other and don't care only about material things. We are an atheist, post-totalitarian country so that might play a role. I know there is always a huge degree of generalization, still, there are some commonalities in every culture. Positives of mine, for instance, are hard-work, determination, realistic perspective etc. Negatives I've covered haha. Other cultures are definitely more sociable, hold together etc., people here are more individualistic and caring for themselves whereas some countries put more emphasis on community and charity.

I don't know if it helps you tell if I have a rapid onset of REM, but when I finally fall asleep, I have the opposite problem, getting up - so I sometimes miss even 5 alarms and I fall asleep right after each one, and even in the 5-10 minute space between them, I have dreams. I mostly remember only the dreams that occur right before I wake up. Does that mean I have a rapid REM onset or it's just natural that if I am in a REM phase already and get woken up for a bit, the REM just resumes? 

I will look into Trazodone.

As for B12, I either lack the intrinsic factor - I read that chronic stress can lead to this which wouldn't be a surprise with my cPTSD, or the fact that I am vegan and had supplemented with cyanocobalamin which I was told had poor oral absorption. The shots also include B1 and B6 and in the meantime I now supplement the methylated versions of all of them and B12 sublingually on the top of that and it seems to be working at least in eliminating the neuropathic itching in my feet and even the fatigue seems to get better, especially the day of the shots (I know, it's probably strange to have both fatigue and insomnia).  

As for ADHD, I take kratom for motivation and anxiety reduction, there isn't adderall in my country, just some very nasty medicament I don't want to be taking.

Keto is great, I am vegan, though, and found vegan keto extremely hard to maintain. So I do at least intermittent fasting while eating high fat. Even keto wasn't enough for reduction in anxiety for me, but then again I am traumatised so it was just hopeful thinking to believe diet could fix everything. But it was great for energy, even IF is, and reduction in hunger, along with the proven health benefits.

Or maybe that was a slight withdrawal? But I haven't been taking lyrica for that long, like a month, 75mg twice a day.

I know it's because of the addiction potential but wasn't sure if it also means that alprazolam downregulates GABA more than diazepam for instance."
DrugNerds,fqxnlyq,t1_fqw6kpu,1589735076.0,"Thanks, this also helps me but do you think it's better than GHB in terms of gaba downregulation? If taken in the therapeutic dosages of course (250-500mg),"
DrugNerds,fqxn9s5,t1_fqwbxfj,1589734929.0,"I agree with you, that's why I am asking here because I have sleep issues but the only things that have helped so far were gabaergics, but I didn't try every medicine there is. And since I am aware of the long-term risks, I want to find something more sustainable. 

But I stated in my post that pregabalin doesn't help in this regard. For anxiety, yes, but I take 75mg and that's not hypnotic at all. Even at this dosage, I develop tolerance so taking up to 225mg would definitely make it less effective for my anxiety for the next days. Also my aim isn't to sleep for 14 hours, just regular 7-8 hours. That's why mirtazapine for example isn't good for me either as it acts for too long. GHB is the best as I can sleep for solid 6-7 hours and feel completely fresh later but it still downregulates GABA, I just don't know how fast and if that's of a big concern given its short half-life. There are many claims GHB is actually quite healthy in moderation but the GABA receptors still make me cautious about using it. It's also used for narcolepsy (Xyrem) in much higher doses than I take and long-term and people don't report withdrawals so I don't think that should be a problem. My issue is that it could make my anxiety worse over time by decreasing GABA, but if the downregulation isn't significant at my dosage and regimen, I would like to know."

So it still would improve my quality of life to be able to use something when I get off-balance which sometimes happens 2x a week, sometimes I am lucky to sleep regularly even for 2 weeks but yeah, it would still be long-term although not daily so I addiction isn't my concern, but health deterioration, increased risk of Alzheimer's (like from benzos) etc are.

As for lyrica, my experience for sleep is mixed. It's not hypnotic for me but if I am anxious, it helps me fall asleep by removing the anxiety. It has a good effect on sleep architecture (as opposed to benzos) which is great. It even made me have a few lucid dreams, but that would be for another topic. I don't know if it helps for GHB induced insomnia though. 

I also have mirtazapine prescribed by my psychiatrist and that's extremely hypnotic! I also have insomnia and this is the med that made me most tired of them all (GHB knock-out dose is stronger, I am sure as I was falling asleep even on slightly over 2g, but mirtazapine is still strong). You then can sleep for even 10-12 hours, I am extremely tired in the morning, struggle to get up, which is why I don't want to take it much but maybe that could be of use for you in your situation. 7.5mg allegedly works best, the lowest common dose is paradoxically the most hypnotic for most people.

She disliked my reading of these books but without them, I would totally trust her that I am just hopeless because I don't really want to heal deep down - which would be false, of course, if I didn't want to heal, would I be trying every possible therapy and technique there was...? 
Luckily, I had a very kind therapist in my UK university (I am from Czechia where the psychotherapy is a bad joke) who also did EMDR and with her, it worked, and she supported and soothed me when I was stuck instead of telling me I don't try hard enough... I am glad at least some places have properly educated and trained therapists. (c)PTSD is really very unknown in Czechia, these pivotal books I had mentioned aren't even translated to Czech and of course most professionals couldn't be bothered to educate themselves in another language... Whereas in anglophone countries, people even say ""this gave me PTSD"" when joking (in a bad taste, imo), but you can see how much more people are aware of it.

mdmatherapy,fqfqhu5,t3_gi3o94,1589329726.0,"I am sorry, but all those who comment OP shouldn't recommend such things, how did you get into MDMA-therapy? It was also recommended to me and helped immensely. I wouldn't have known otherwise. It's not like OP will or can do this against their will, OP just wants to provide testimonies so they can decide for themselves (or so I read it).

The person who recommended it to me was a neurosciences PhD student so he knew what he was talking about but OP states they do their research, which is widely available, so it's not like they will pop a pill and have no idea what they are going for. I read about it myself in Van Der Kolk's ""The Body Keeps the Score"" but I had no idea how to source illicit drugs at that time. If everything had to be done by therapists and ""professionals"" most people wouldn't have gone anywhere. There are risks doing it with underground therapists too, they are often very shady people and can manipulate people in these vulnerable states. The only legal option that I know of are MAPS trials which are available to a lucky few in the USA - not everyone here is from the states. Would you really make people suffer needlessly when there is this chance? (c)PTSD is no joke and kills much more than MDMA, I might have killed myself already, hadn't it been for MDMA because going through the same hell for years and years  every day without any sign of improvement can only be sustained for so long. 

I am all for responsible, educated MDMA use. If there is enough research done beforehand, you can achieve quite a controlled environment. Besides, MDMA has helped many people who took it only recreationally. It's almost as if some healing is inevitable with it. The extent of it then depends indeed on what you do during the session (e.g. staying with yourself will probably be more helpful than being in a group of friends and talking about random stuff) and what you the days/weeks after for integration. 

As for how MDMA helped me, in short, it was mainly dissolving old body tensions. It was happening automatically, the process was effortless. Then, I noticed that with every session my anxiety got less intense. It's still there, but it's not like 10/10 on the scale of suffering as it used to be, rather something like 3 or 4/10. My reactivity is much lower, I used to have strong panic reaction when confronted with a trigger which would automatically make the rest of my day very painful. I now only have very weak echoes of these states and I hope even they will disappear in time. So it's like if it cleaned my body which was tense for years, with many weird body sensations and pains. And I didn't even have to focus on it, it was like if I was half-dreaming and the body knew what to do. It taught me that I don't have to understand everything intellectually for things to work out. And that I don't need to control the process (or even can't for that matter - apart from the setting etc. obviously). Just surrender to MDMA and let it do its healing."
naath,fqfnijm,t1_fqe5nj9,1589328117.0,"Please don't be unnecessarily and wrongly critical. Even if I take all subjective things about it away, you're still wrong since the show was filmed in Hungary, Austria, the Canary Islands etc. The show has two female leads and only one male lead. The books are all finished... so it's not they didn't use ANY of these points, three of them are used without question and I think the casting and iconic details were well done too (think Tissaia or Calanthe, heck, this show has such a female prominence I really don't know if you were watching the same show). 

I confess I didn't like the Witcher as much the first time I saw it but that was true for GoT too, actually. Something drew me to rewatch them, though, and only while seeing it again and connecting the dots I started to truly appreciate it. Not to mention the characters grow on me every rewatch. Both have quite a complex screenplay for the first-timers, which was why I felt confused the first time while watching Witched - all the timeline jumps etc. But it really fits together if you give it another go and book readers weren't confused from what I've read and heard. 

It made me want to visit those locations, the same way GoT did, it had some truly powerful messages, especially around Yennefer, the music was fantastic... The rating is at 8,3/10 at imdb so I think it's more than a half-way decent show. It's different from GoT, true, but that doesn't mean it's bad."

They could have stayed consistent in the film-universe instead of picking a girl with so bold-coloured brown eyes. Deathly Hallows, Part 2 felt as the most rushed and faulty film from the series for me.  

Yeah, if she indeed looks so much older, it's not that great because a 12 and 16-year-old behave so differently. Sometimes you can be lucky to find an older actor who still looks like a child as for example Freya Allan who played Ciri in the Witcher who was supposed to be 12 (and looked 12 imo) but the actress was 17-18 when they filmed it. I get it when they want to cast a more experienced actor for one of the leading roles, a 12-year-old has still a lot of opportunities to learn in smaller roles or productions. Of course, sometimes you have a brilliant child actor who can do leads from small age like Elijah Wood but that seems to be quite rare. It's also probably healthier for a child not to be at the sets all the time. It can be a fantastic experience as what Dan, Emma and Rupert probably had, but it can be also very damaging for the developing brain - like what happened to Judy Garland."
gaybros,fqe8uz1,t1_fq8evm3,1589303640.0,"Alright, that makes sense. I kept hearing generic homophobic remarks, jokes etc. all the time so I thought your country must have been great if people didn't talk about it in public. Maybe it's just not a part of your culture as much as for example some English speakers use the word ""gay"" as ""bad, embarassing"" etc.? We don't use ""gay"" as a defaming adjective either but you hear a lot of words like ""fag**t"" and how it's not natural, how gays aren't true men, how lesbians are all ugly etc... It's true there isn't much physical violence in Czechia but the verbal toxicity is still very much present, despite such people being only a minority. This behaviour is tolerated, though, the same way as racism. You can be racist and are often even praised for it, it's very sad.

Hungergames,fqe7lt1,t1_fqdbnz5,1589303062.0,"I agree, I wish film adaptations got more respect based on their quality, not based on the fidelity to the book. Sometimes it's actually counterproductive. 

You are right about these minor unncessary changes, sometimes they really break the immersion like casting of young Lily Potter with brown eyes when we have been hearing for a decade ""You have your mother's eyes"". I usually don't mind aging the characters a bit, Jennifer Lawrence is a great example because a younger actress probably wouldn't give such a great, mature performance.

Yes, but I am not spewing toxicity because of my desire to read something. I don't know why you think we refer to ""talking politely"" as toxicity. I wasn't referring to this thread in particular, just the very common toxic remarks which sometimes include the death threats you mention or saying he will die before he finishes that. I find that of very bad taste. But I think we can agree on that. I also respect criticism, I know first-hand how useful it can be, but critics' focus is the work, not the circumstances, their job isn't to criticise GRRM's life like ""How dares he write something else when we are still waiting for Winds of Winter?"", their job is to criticise the finished work.

gabagoodness,fqe3my2,t1_fgmj27y,1589301214.0,"I must point out lyrica doesn't bind to GABA receptors so it doesn't damage them. I was also surprised because it is, after all, preGABAlin, but what you are describing is a danger for benzodiazepines, phenibut etc, not lyrica. Lyrica has quite unusual mechanism of action. There is definitely a tolerance build, especially at such high doses as OP takes, but it is a much much more sustainable option than most anxiolytics. Obviously, every drug comes with some risks and side-effects, but if you have to choose between suicidal depression and lyrica, I would take lyrica any day. It's not like taking heroin or even benzos for that matter. These catastrophic scenarios really shouldn't be spread without providing proofs of such statements, e.g. why  would OP not experience pleasure from most things except drugs just by taking lyrica? That's quite a stretch for taking a prescribed medication, making it on par with severe addiction, alcoholism etc. People with mental illness are the last ones that should be needlessly scared. I doubt psychiatrists would prescribe it so often if the risks were too high especially when they are very cautious about benzos for instance. 

I am not saying lyrica is perfect, it has some unpleasant side-effects for me like difficulty urinating and troubles getting up if I take it before sleeping, but saying you'll basically be done for life after a few months or years isn't a realistic scenario either. 600mg a day probably isn't as sustainable tolerance-wise as e.g. my 75-150mg a day but I have been using this much for a year without any reduction in effects which is in stark contrast to gaba-ergics like benzos and phenibut where I have seen the effects steadily decreasing and I didn't want to become dependant on them. So lyrica has been a great aid for easing my anxiety and depression symptoms without having to resort to addictive and more damaging medication. 

Misinformation only makes people afraid of taking any medication which can be fatal as you can only do so much on your own if you suffer from mental illness and conventional therapy isn't very succesful in those with treatment-resistant ailments. If taking lyrica helps one with depression, it is undoubtedly a safer option for most people than being suicidal. It's often best to combine psychotherapy with medication since a traumatised or depressed brain isn't very malleable. This can be changed by correct medication thus making a new window of opportunity for change. Perhaps the biggest benefit of lyrica for me is its ability to allow me to cry and since depression is often repressed sadness and anger, this is extremely helpful. Normally, I would be just stuck without being able to release the emotions. I then find relief and it's in no way just a high, rather a natural emotional release, although delayed for years."
Hungergames,fqcls0r,t1_fqaemcu,1589261653.0,"It's a different medium. Obviously a book can go deeper thematically but there's also only so much words can do to convey emotions, for instance. I am much more easily moved by seeing good actors reacting to a characters death for example than reading about it, music also does a lot. I only cried in a few books but in countless films and series. Sometimes I find film adaptations actually more polished even regarding to writing with a better attention to detail as ever scene carries much more weight than in a book where there can be many more of them. I respect your opinion but I think people are just way too often holding this opinion a book is by default always superior which is kind of a limiting perspective. It may be because people are reluctant to let go of their first experience with the story and dislike every little change to the story - not saying this is your reason, just what I have seen as the most common criticism - changes. Doesn't matter if it's for the better or worse, book purists will NEVER be content. See for example the lord of the rings, 3 of the most celebrated films in history (much more consistently ranked in the top 10 lists than the books which I personally agree with, have read much better books, haven't seen many better movies) but book purists still hate them, being completely blind to their beauty and cinematic genius."

Can't say it would have been unexpected for king's landing to burn but I definitely felt shocked when she did it despite the bells ringing. So even though the burning could be expected (unless you still had unrealistic beliefs in dany), the show still managed to surprise me by making the act much more personal than a simple question of surrender by Cersei or the populace's part. This way, the act became much more about Dany than the current plot circumstances which I think was brilliant and brought about the culmination of her character's arc. 

I also loved the atmosphere and music in the end when Arya leaves the apocalyptic scene on the white horse. The gentle caressing symbolised for me the contrasting way Arya has chosen, one of tenderness and hope instead of violence. It felt so otherworldly, like being reborn and Arya in a way was indeed."

gaybros,fq8chl0,t3_ghboc6,1589163088.0,"It's well known many men think themselves desirable until they die. But it's quite annoying even if they are your age which happened to me at least three times. One of them was even my friend, until he learnt I was gay, then he stopped talking to me. This was in Mexico when I was there on an exchange in case you're curious. Most people were really gay-friendly, though, just a couple of these self-absorbed prats thought I was attracted to them and that I somehow wouldn't be able to control it? One even attacked me while drunk and was strangling me... Their fears were unfounded though, I am a virgin to this day so definitely no sexual predator and especially the one who strangled me disgusted me but he still thought I loved him and what not,  and what's worse, even his family thought it. And what's the worst, I had to live with him for months because he was a part of my exchange family.  Happy times. And they said an exchange is the best year of your life...

I live in Czechia and many guys keep their distance, in some cases I don't even deserve a handshake or a hug which kind of makes me sad when I see the same guys doing these things with other straight guys but not with me even though one of them is my close friend. 

Where do you live, if I may ask? Because I have been hearing homophobic comments all my life (not necessarily directed to me, most people don't know), especially high school was a living hell, I even had to fake a relationship with a girl to avoid severe bullying... So I am just wondering which country is apparently quite safe if you only heard it once and from the older generation."

I was given a bouquet for my graduation as an only guy there and I was so happy about it.

Flowers are such a beautiful thing and I appreciate them for what they are, apart from their being also a nice gesture of appreciation and love. I honestly felt a bit jealous about girls receiving them all the time so I asked for them as my graduation present haha.

CPTSD,fq7sx3c,t1_fq7ci7z,1589151546.0,"Thank you. My cPTSD indeed manifests mainly physically. I have a lot of weird body aches and tensions. When distressed, I even feel my lips and muscles around my mouth twitching. I think it's repressed anger trying to ""break free"". I, however, tried a lot of therapies but in my country the ""professionals"" are very uneducated about trauma so I have spent a lot of money with no positive effect. A good resource for self-help would be great. I did yoga and qi-gong, it helped some, but I had most success with psychedelic therapy although now I am taking a break as it's both psychologically and physically very demanding. Maybe I should combine psychedelic therapy with body therapy for largest effect. It sometimes forces me to do body-work, anyway, and my bodily symptoms were alleviated a great deal but I think I am now in a ""depressed stage"" of a recovery where my biggest issue is depression instead of high anxiety. For example, the waking up stress reaction is so much better now! I have to remind myself of these partial victories to remain hopeful sometimes. 

I also know Irene Lyon but I was put off by the fact she wants money for the supposedly best information she has to offer. I know she has to make some money for living but it's too great a risk for me. But the free content is definitely helpful too.

I prefer art too, I honestly don't find photos of people all that interesting, I don't understand how every other random person gets more followers for their substance-less content than e.g. a professional landscape photographer. 

I'm sorry you also struggle to have local friends. I too have some long-distance friendships, especially one keeps me afloat as we talk almost every day. Without her, I would be totally alone... Luckily, I have dogs, which are my true best friends, but I used to be quite talkative before my cPTSD so I also have the need to talk with people... which isn't met often. You're right about the shared interest communities, I just wonder how to find them. There isn't much going on in the city as most people just care about their jobs, gyms at most... When I studied abroad in a small Welsh town, I had so much more things to do than in a central European capital haha. All the societies and sports there were great, people actually LIVED there, not only survived. But since the COVID-19 situation, I am not sure if I'll be able to go back for autumn.

I love them more than they me which is quite frustrating, only makes me feel there's something inherently wrong with me.

As for the selfies, I agree there's nothing wrong about them per se, but I don't like when they become the centre of someone's life or others keep shoving them into my face nonstop. I already have self-image issues because of the media, don't want to reinforce it further.

Sorry if you didn't look for advice, just sharing one of the possibilities you might look into. Also had a look of what you use now in the comments and yeah, these things are weak for me too to make any difference, except pregabalin and benzos for anxiety of course but they do little to depressive symptoms in my experience and are very unlikely to give you energy and motivation.

microdosing,fpl76i1,t3_gdy52z,1588707574.0,"Mostly vasoconstriction and uncomfortable stimulation which felt almost like anxiety. But I had a lot of anxiety at the time I microdosed so it probably just made it feel different. When I did psychedelics lately, feeling better, the body discomfort was almost nonexistant. It's true that I used mescaline, though, which is definitely gentler than LSD even mentally. I also tried ALD-52 and it was comfortable even at that time when I had a lot of anxiety. Mushrooms sometimes made me totally calm, other times I also had the body-load but I think it was dose-dependant. Even microdosing is a scale so you have to find your sweet spot. Lower dose sadly doesn't necessarily mean it's always with fewer side effects. The most uncomfortable microdose of LSD was 8ug which was the lowest I did. 15ug was much better for me. Also LSD is very long-lasting so even if I took it the first thing I still often had trouble falling asleep - but I also have ADHD which supposedly amplifies and prolongs many drugs' effects so it shouldn't be a problem for most people. Curiously, mescaline which is also long-lasting, doesn't prevent me from sleep, I even fell asleep for a nap on the ""peak"" several times. I only once fell asleep on LSD, it was the 8ug dose and the dream was quite scary with some aliens and it also gave me sleep paralysis. Don't recommend napping on LSD, haha.

Even though my primary problem was severe anxiety which I didn't identify myself for years because the awareness here is really bad and I kept hearing anxiety defined by doctors as obsessive fear that something bad will surely happen. Maybe, but that's a simplification. It can also be almost purely somatic like in my case. So I just felt like my body tortured me and I didn't know what to do about it. Something like pregabalin (Lyrica) which I am on now would have saved me a lot of pain... No, instead I got SSRIs which did nothing good and only killed my libido at the age of 18 and I probably now have PSSD - it still didn't return after 7 years. Psychiatric healthcare here is both backwards and corrupt, they just give you what health insurance companies currently promote... They receive bonus for that (and it works like that in other spheres too, just cash the patient/customer as much as you can and we'll give you more money for this shady behaviour). I gave up on them honestly. 

I also definitely learn more on my own than with the ""professionals"", either by reading books on trauma like The Body Keeps the Score; Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving or even Tolle and things like The Power of Now, or here on reddit which proved an excellent resource and changed my life for the better. Someone on another sub has actually correctly diagnosed my B12 deficiency which a doctor couldn't do... So you can see how educated the ""professionals"" in this country are."
Hungergames,fpcub6g,t1_fpawh5j,1588512879.0,"Not saying that and I imagine many people disliked the shaky cam genuinely. If you came to this conclusion by yourself based on your own standards of what a good cinematography is, I absolutely respect it. But then you have masses of people who just have the need to criticise everything so they jump on the hate-train which is sheep or herd behaviour in my opinion. Look what happened for example to Game of Thrones over a stupid Starbucks cup that I still haven't even noticed and don't care about. I think movies/series are complex so even if you dislike one component of it like cinematography in this case, it doesn't make the whole film bad and you can enjoy the rest. And if I mention great cinematography to someone they are like ""What?"" and suddenly everybody is an expert on it? Weird... Not saying I am, but I at least pay attention to it. I also preferred the cinematography from CF on, but that's subjective and I still think the shaky cam was there for a certain artistic vision. The loud critique just makes it sound like if HG was some sort of cheap B-movie. Meanwhile, the franchise is the best-rated one in the YA genre as far as I know."

I also didn't like everything about them but that's normal and would give it a go, but I couldn't... When I lived in a smaller city, the situation was better. Actually, what would work best for me is to meet others at a holiday where you get to know people much better and have to spend time with them. This anonymity of big cities might be great for hookups but regarding relationships, it's a sad place to be ime. The fact they just disappear without a word is also something I find totally rude and I would actually like to know what they didn't like so I might think about it.

If what stops the attraction are indeed your thoughts, then it's a problem of your perspective (and some would even call it transphobic, but I think it's just unusual for many people and they need some space to process it). Objectively, there is no problem, it's just in people's underlying opinions and beliefs which can be changed. One of the reasons why they aren't considered equal is that people don't see them as ""proper men"" because they weren't born with penis. But the same was and still is said about gay men, especially if you are ""feminine"". It's just culture which is full of bullshit. And I am often saddened to see gays, who know discrimination first-hand, unable to see behind their own bubble and lack the empathy for other groups. Ironically, they supposedly support LGBT+ but somehow the T gets shunned. 

I can't say it's wrong or not not to be attracted to them just because they weren't born a boy in the first place, that would be very black and white thinking. However, I think if this is your perspective than it can be quite limiting to you and could potential hurt trans people who go through rejection all the time for something out of their control.

I would be more interested about what other cinematographers say about it but I have seen a lot of movies and series with terrible cinematography but HG wasn't one of them.

RationalPsychonaut,fp4obxj,t3_gau47t,1588303475.0,"If I were you, I would stop, this sounds scary. But if you really want to give it another go, I would try something gentler than LSD. Personally, the least anxiety-inducing and challenging was San Pedro for me (not pure mescaline, not Peruvian Torch, San Pedro really). From what I have read, most people had the same experience. I also have troubles handling psychedelics, although I didn't have derealization, just really strong anxiety or depressive states, but San Pedro is manageable. It still can get challenging, though, but I always feel much better after I get over the hard bit as if I released some of my old emotional baggage. It also didn't have this ""dark"" headspace as LSD or shrooms can give me but there still was a bit low-key paranoia. If I feel a bit low, adding kratom always boosts my mood and helps with anxiety and paranoia. The same with LSD although if you take too big a dose, even kratom may not help as the experience will be too strong and you could actually become even more uncomfortable due to the additional stimulation from kratom. Also many people trip with benzos so you may look into that, they also helped me but I try not to use them as they supposedly limit the therapeutic potential of psychedelics. Another medication that might help is pregabalin (lyrica). 

But I am just listing these as a way to minimise the risks in case you decide to try psychedelics again. But please really weight carefully if you do, it would be so sad if you had some permanent damage from them. Don't feel pressured to like psychedelics just because everyone on reddit is posting fantastic, beautiful stories. If they don't agree with you, be guided by your own experiences. There are so many other things in this world you can love. It's impossible for a single human to experience all the beauty there is. For instance, ski jumpers love their sport, they get the best sensations during their free fall, when they win a medal etc. I would love to have this experience too but I am too clumsy for something like that and would probably kill myself.

I still think meditation is great and people should definitely try it before they move to mind-altering substances. They were really a last resort for me so I'm glad something finally helped. I probably just need more of some hormones in order to feel certain things that are important for healing. Before, I was in a constant ""freeze"" state so emotions were trapped inside, I couldn't cry, get angry, relax, nothing... I felt the same all the time, now it's more fluid as it should be. I also think meditation is great for tracking thought processes and seeing them for what they are.

kratom,fp2tqfw,t1_foyvxfr,1588267732.0,"I'm glad sitting with those feelings helped you, that's the ideal outcome they present in all the meditation books etc. Sadly, my experience is different. I sat with those feelings nonstop even without meditation, they couldn't be ignored, it felt like my whole consciousness was at least 2/3 this pain and only 1/3 could be dedicated to the outside life. With meditation, it got even more painful but it didn't sink away... First thing that helped was MDMA used therapeutically and then I used kratom and phenibut which helped me to normalise the feelings of calm. Finally, anxiety and odd physical discomfort didn't fill all my consciousness. At first, it was quite of a shock so naturally I was expecting the pain to return soon. And it did in the beginning. But as I gained more confidence that I can feel ok, the fear of the pain returning slowly disappeared so it's no longer my baseline. There is still daily anxiety of much lesser intensity, but it goes away, it's not a 24/7 thing like before. A lot of it must have been emotional release from MDMA therapy but important aspect was also a stabilisation in my daily life for which kratom has been invaluable. Maybe meditation could do the same, but it would definitely take much more time and needless pain for me. I love the idea of meditation and admire those who practice it diligently, but it's not always the best route for everybody. There are more efficient treatments for trauma. But I am so happy it helps a lot of people, maybe it will help me too with some smaller issues but for my intense anxiety it wasn't enough, even retraumatising at times."

I was assuming you weren't off it for longer than a day because if so, you probably couldn't have slept even the day before. But if you lost some progress I feel bad about giving you that advice. I just know lack of sleep by itself is very damaging, I have symptoms from it that might feel like withdrawal too, elevated anxiety, heart palpitations, high blood pressure etc. And having withdrawals on top of it... And obviously, we don't have all the information about you. I was operating under the impression you would be merely postponing quitting g for a few hours not that you already had some significant progress behind you. Really sorry."
Psychonaut,fp00ssr,t1_foyeze0,1588200353.0,"Oh, that's truly incredible. USA have the biggest economy so I would imagine most people could live comfortably but these prices for everything are just ridiculous. Even UK has quite high tuition fees but it's still like 10 times lower and you also get generous funding, heck if you don't earn enough, you don't even have to repay it. I guess it's better to be a student in a poorer country in Europe. It's a shame international students have to pay in the EU so Americans really don't have much choice even if they wanted to study abroad."
GHB_info,fozz0n2,t3_gai8s9,1588199413.0,"I'm no expert on GHB but no sleep is probably more damaging than taking another dose, I think taking it to fall asleep is the lesser evil. You can power through it when you get up."

CPTSD,fozlue7,t1_foy6jh0,1588192824.0,"Me too, I would love to be a writer, I keep getting ideas and insights, but just can't commit to do the hard work and actually write the stories. And this is something I love... I obviously can't get myself to do things I'm less interested in like finding a part-time job, exercising, replying to stressful emails and so on. Not to mention I've never had a relationship at the age of 25."
CPTSD,fozkw7o,t1_foxz6hf,1588192368.0,"Wow, your comment moved me so much I almost cried. Thank you!

 I keep resenting myself lately about how unproductive I am, but it's true that if I hadn't been so stressed and traumatized, it probably wouldn't be so. And I also know the pressure of ""be productive or you're useless"" is toxic and enforced by oppressive authorities to control us, but they still managed to get this kind of thinking ingrained and I can't help but feel guilty all the time. I'm 25 and I would already like to retire so I could do whatever I want, when I want it, instead of being forced to follow some arbitrary deadlines and requirements all the while I struggle with anxiety, depression and ADD on top of that."
CPTSD,foy885k,t1_foxtuds,1588167506.0,"While I agree it's not the place to advocate *recreational* use, you really don't need a lincensed psychologist for MDMA therapy. It's useful to have them for integration period after but many people had success on their own and even in MAPS trials, the therapist isn't there to guide the person, just to offer the support if needed. Anyway, it's still not approved and in most countries even trials aren't an option so you won't have the luck to do it with a therapist. Still, scientific evidence suggests it's maybe the single most succesful therapeutic approach, and having done it myself, I can't really condone asking people to suffer for god knows how many more years until they decide to make MDMA legal again. A close person, when both of you are educated about how to use it therapeutically, should do. Also some people advocate for doing it solo altogether. Trauma therapy is very individual, you sadly can't do that in a scientific setting, it doesn't mean it's the only possible approach. People have used psychedelics for millenia without licensed therapists. I am not saying it's without risks but I might have already killed myself as I have tried every kind of therapy there is before MDMA for years, this was my last chance. Everyone must weigh this for themselves and educate themselves beforehand. There are also many underground ""therapists"" who have harmed people in this vulnerable state. Just blindly trusting authorities is actually what led many people into being traumatized. And I have met horrible ""therapists"" sober, I can't imagine what damage they could have done to me with MDMA. There are risks in everything, even a seemingly innocent thing like meditation can cause panic attacks for some people.

Also, I have never been a party person, but statements as ""everyone should stop having parties in general"" seem quite patronizing as if you know what everyone's idea of fun should be. It can turn into an unhealthy habit, for sure, like everything, but I don't think a birthday party is something to be shamed."
kratom,foy5g9x,t1_fovex0i,1588165747.0,"On the other hand, for people with severe anxiety, (c)PTSD etc., meditation can be a really painful experience sober. I tortured myself with meditation for years, believing it was the only way out, but I suffered even more for it and was so desperate... Then I learnt about MDMA therapy for (c)PTSD and started to use kratom and it helped me so much more and  I didn't look back. So I would even be willing to give meditation another shot after reading OP's post, but for some people it really can be even harmful to meditate, I have since then read many other testimonials of people with overactivated nervous system that too found more harm than good in meditation. Of course, I used to blame myself, but meditation really isn't the best option for many people, at least until they get a bit more stabilized. It even can send many people into panic attacks, which luckily didn't happen to me but I was close to it sometimes. And believe me, I was so persistent with my practice even though I didn't see any improvements, but as I sunk even lower, I had to abandon it. But I can imagine if meditation is a part of your routine for personal growth or another higher purpose, it is as you say, better not to rely on any substance. Just offering my experience when I meditated with severe anxiety."
mdmatherapy,fomxmsx,t3_g8cmod,1587906945.0,"I'm very happy it helped you. I would just like to point out that your choice of words "" I like most of you have had alot of bad things happen in life but chose poorly on how to deal with them. "" may not be the most fortunate and could be triggering to some people as most of us here deal with (c)PTSD. When you are traumatised, you really don't have much choice, especially if it happened in your childhood and you never learnt how to process your emotions in a healthy way. I am sure you didn't mean it like this but it could come across as victim-blaming. Maybe it's just the kind of attitude that has influenced you, it's predominant where I live too. I hear celebrities saying things like ""Stop whimpering, just be positive"" - very helpful... I am also in the CPTSD sub, and I have noticed many people can get distressed quite easily by such things so it's just a friendly advice."

antiwork,fo6hphk,t1_fo6ab59,1587559082.0,"It's a joke. But nobody should be forced to work to survive, many indeed work and hardly survive. That's not fair. If people did what they really are meant to do, we could live. Many, myself included, love growing crops, so there definitely would be food. The same applies for other things. People farmed, crafted and built long before the concept of a job. And isn't it strange people in older times lived in such harsh environment yet worked much less than we do nowadays? I would even enjoy working at a supermarket if it was for let's say 4 hours, not up to 12 hours 5 days a week what I did. There are things I enjoyed about it, but definitely not the fact I could hardly do anything else except sleeping a bit."
mdmatherapy,fnyk11k,t1_fnwldt4,1587365498.0,"Spot on! As if people wanted to become ""troubled individuals""... I really don't understand how people can blame them instead of wondering what caused it."

CPTSD,fmwn4kf,t3_fxliqh,1586449543.0,"True, I have the same problem. My baggage is emotional, not rational. Even psychedelic therapy, which normally gives people a lot new realisations and perspective isn't so much about that for me rather it's about dealing with my feelings and I don't need any particular memories connected to them to process them because it's just my everyday life, not something that happened only once, years ago... the good thing is that psychedelics showed me what I needed, not what some therapeutic approach preaches I need. CBT just has a monopoly over psychotherapeutic services but it doesn't mean it will help everyone or worse that if it doesn't work for you, nothing will or it's your fault. I've grown weary of therapists who only offer one therapeutic approach, it doesn't offer flexibility for something as complex as (c)PTSD, I for example have strong physical body aches which most therapies wouldn't even find relevant."
