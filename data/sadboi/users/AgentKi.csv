ShinyPokemon,fn5xcfw,t1_fn5uz5h,1586679244.0,I would give you advice but don't know what game/method you're using. It does all come down to luck in the end so keep up the hussle and goodluck mate.
ShinyPokemon,fn5gfc8,t3_fzpka1,1586664193.0,"I have played pokemon for a long time and encountered quite a few shinnies. But this is the first time I tried to hunt one in it ending in succession.

Usually I never had the patience as this took me almost a week with 3 hours put in each day and a day with 7 hours. Only kept count of hrs but the amounts I've encountered is over 1,000 definitely.

Glad I kept determined as the satisfaction was all well worth it! Don't know what to name him yet but to anyone else hunting shinnies and reading this, I wish you my deepest and humble regards. Goodluck!"

SuicideWatch,fczv16e,t3_eieayu,1578109089.0,"Definitely. 
Especially now since the reassurance of loneliness and futility keeps striding. I don't remember everything I've done or said but all I know is that it's my fault for being a hermit. Or so it seems... This subreddit though, really can put you at ease at least^"
