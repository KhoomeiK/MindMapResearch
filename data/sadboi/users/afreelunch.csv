Thought it might be nice to go look at the ocean. I haven’t been in years. I decided against it. I’m just hanging tight in my house. Dog is loving it. 


I am sorry it’s so stupid out there. I wasn’t imagining it was going to be busy at all when I contemplated going. Probably would have turned back if I saw that much traffic too.

He’s just a very chill and sweet dog. Very stable. I’m concerned this move will stress him out a lot. It’s likely I’m just stressed out and projecting a bit, but if I have a good plan in place before we go, it will be less traumatic for both of us."
Greyhounds,fjj6lgr,t1_fjj24nd,1583384807.0,"I’ve been doing research on the area and also scouting on foot trying to find an enclosed area he would be allowed to run. It’s just not gonna happen. It’s in a dense pop area- lots of apartments and shopping malls. There isn’t even a park in walking distance. He is an adult- not a senior. Doesn’t seem to have any issues waiting to use the bathroom. He likes to do a nice run about once per day if it is nice out, otherwise he is pretty much out for a few minutes to pee and running back in. 

I’ve trained him to tell me when he wants to go outside. He just has to touch the door handle. Sometimes it’s only been half an hour since he was last out and I can say “no” if I’m working or something and don’t want to let him out. Or if I’m trying to sleep saying no will sorta be a snooze button- but he will do it again after a bit. 

When it was too wet and muddy in the dog park we would go on two 1 hour walks a day- once in the morning and once at night and I would take him out for quick pee breaks in between. 
Taking him out more often if he is older, is that because they can’t wait as long between having to pee? 


I know it’s not the best place for him, not having access to a fenced yard, but it’s the best I can do right now. I want him to be as comfortable as possible. He is my sweet boy and I love to see him run around. I’ve been looking into services that will pick us up to go to the dog park, but none seem to operate in my city."

I tried to get my dog to follow me, but decided he wasn’t ready/didn’t want to join me so I left him downstairs with my roommate. I left my door open in case he wanted to join me: another thing I never do. I always sleep with door shut. I thought if he wanted to go out either he could come get me or ask my roommate. NBD. 

The change of routine really freaked him out instead. My roommate texted me pretty quickly to tell me he was upset (I didn’t see that until later). I heard him come upstairs and into my room at one point but wasn’t really paying attention. Later my roommate came up to bed and apparently he was laying in the hall outside my door- weird- and when she passed him she sort went towards my door and he jumped up and bit her. 


This dog never ever bites and they were both shocked. I awoke to her cry of surprise- no damage- and her telling him off. Then I got up and ushered him into my room after apologizing. 


I went back to bed feeling even worse and she just texted me a bunch from her room saying NBD, he was acting strange and didn’t actually harm her- just scared her a bit. She even said he looked really surprised and sorry. 


Leading theory is he was scared I was sick or something and guarding me. The last few days I’ve been letting him on the bed to sleep and snuggle with me: which is normally a challenge since he is a huge dog. I feel so bad I am upsetting my boy to this point. He’s been a good companion."

BipolarReddit,etm8gyp,t1_etlw3yn,1562954330.0,"I want to throw them out or delete them- I have journals and stuff in notebooks going back 20 years almost. And the notes I keep on my phone are from the past 3ish years now. 

I think about tossing everything but it’s usually when I’m in some sort of episode or state that I think that- so I hold off until I am feeling more stable to make that decision. 

I really like having the data. Even if it’s not really valuable to read. It is a history and there are patterns within. 

My therapist is way better at seeing the patterns fr the outside- she can see stuff coming and isn’t surprised as much as I am. 

My hope is one day I will be able to compile the data and see the patterns a little better. I even try to put useful details right up top so I don’t have to read into the journals- like just time/date/overall mood. 

Regardless it’s therapeutic for me. 


I think some sort of more complex record keeping would be good- but I don’t have a computer. Just my smart phone. I would totally use some sort of program so I could add or delete garbage easier."
BipolarReddit,etlvew3,t1_etlshu0,1562946183.0,"I write a lot too... and when I read over it it is mostly garbage. Or same with the talking i will start by writing a list with bullet points and asterisks... and it just melts apart into a word goo. I hate reading it. 
I take a lot of notes and do a lot of journaling to help organize my thoughts and right now it’s kind of worthless. 

I guess it’s useful so I can look back on this section and go- yup that’s some mania right there. 

My records go back several years so I can see the patterns- when I really depressed there are lots of tear marks on the pages. 

I just want it to stop so bad."
BipolarReddit,etlsx1v,t1_etl36xe,1562944579.0,"Yup I give way too many details to make points for both sides, explain everything, leave nothing out, play devils advocate... 

No one cares and no one is listening. I really could use this time/energy better. Lol now I’m just using it to worry about how I’m talking waaaaay too much and it sucks too."
BipolarReddit,etlsol7,t1_etlbri8,1562944427.0,"My therapist is great. She knows, and clearly isn’t taking it personally. Part of me interrupting her was apologizing for interrupting her so much haha. 
I know she understands. I am really embarrassed and feel guilty. 

I got a new job. It’s going great but it’s just a big change. When I first got it, my therapist warned me that this change would likely take me a few weeks to adjust before my anxiety levels dropped. This last session she said 3-6 months! That’s so long."
BipolarReddit,etls892,t1_etlg2ge,1562944131.0,I have been trying to warn people that I’m trying but might not be successful... I’m trying so hard.
TrollXChromosomes,etgojde,t3_cbeb4g,1562795529.0,I’m a Chef and my seasoning is on point. And it’s my biggest fantasy to be a mermaid or otter. It’s more likely I won’t get it because it’s not possible...
BipolarReddit,et9rkj5,t3_caiah7,1562603810.0,"I am totally hypomanic and love it. But I know it’s fucked up and I need to slow my roll. Everyone else loves it too and it’s hard to pump the breaks when I am getting such positive feedback and love from people. 

They miss the shit where I’m not sleeping, crying, raging, or getting into paranoid episodes. 

You are not being dramatic. It is a real double edged sword. I would rather be able to relax- it’s impossible for me, I imagine it must be for you since you are self medicating with spirits and drugs. I had to seriously cut back on that. It doesn’t fix the problem, but it makes it a bit easier for people to understand that “no I’m not partying. I have a serious illness.”

At least that’s my take. 

I think sometimes I am just being extra and dramatic too. I hear your suffering."
ChoosingBeggars,es4tbxk,t1_es35rsf,1561593366.0,"Lol as someone who makes fries all day long, they die so quick that when I have extra I always give them away."
bipolar,erlks9i,t3_c2lb1e,1560989840.0,"Just started a new job and am getting used to a new routine. So far so good- in days I work. 
I forgot to take all my meds on my weekend and didn’t realize it at all! No idea why, other than the complete change in my routine- I was sure to set times for work days, but just completely neglected my days off. 

I also fucked up a bunch last week- just straight up forgot to take a bunch of doses of various things. Way scatter brained. 

I’m still transitioning!"
BipolarReddit,eqt1lc5,t3_bzjmxb,1560299650.0,Hey I know I feel like Hypomania is great when I’m hypomanic.
KidsAreFuckingStupid,eqnvjri,t1_eqm3e2s,1560180777.0,"I thought about that too. It’s possible for sure. And likely what I would do. But I wouldn’t want to have to plan around that. I don’t want to be punished because my kid is an asshole. 
I would rather punish him in some way that would actually disappoint him. Like no TV for a month or no treats. 
In fact I would let him eat one of the mystery cans for some privilege. Either way I’m replacing the cans. If I can’t figure out what they are."
KidsAreFuckingStupid,eqltlpk,t1_eqlpij6,1560149837.0,"My rule is they eat what I give them or they get nothing. 
But I would feel like a shitty person if I gave my kid canned pears and pumpkin for dinner. I would not want that- 

I would rather he eat a regular nutritious meal and not scream or be in a foul mood from being hungry."
KidsAreFuckingStupid,eql525q,t3_bysdzk,1560137261.0,"The scene where it’s a “surprise” isn’t fun or funny at all- even if I was drunk. Surprise! Canned green beans... hahahaha... this is hilarious. 
And no way is a kid going to be accountable. They are not gonna go for a surprise dinner."
