Lowes,fojqglw,t1_fojmvbe,1587827199.0,I saw the video and he absolutely did say that. He tried to clarify later and he was being sarcastic but by the way he talks in the clip he sounds like he's puting it out as a serious idea and is just backtracking to be honest. And even if he was joking he should know that many people in the US treat his words like gospel and listen to him over any medical professional. He should know how much power his words have and how essential he really is in this crisis but time and time again we've seen him fail and cause more harm than good.

HumansBeingBros,fmj33ol,t1_fmiubr0,1586122055.0,"I understand your frustration and how counter productive it seems. But we need humane, habitat focused zoos like the Australia zoo, and countless others who raise animals right and focus on rehabilitation and species preservation because the sad reality is that one of the biggest threat to animals right now is poaching. These cartels are ruthless and care nothing for what they hunt or the amount they hunt, look no further than the pangolin scales black market, they've been known to wipe out entire species. Do i like most zoos? not really, i dont think anyone truly does. But seeing that some zoos like this are at least trying to make their animals happy and healthy gives me hope ‚ò∫"

What kills them is this deceptive advertising and the absolute overkill of adverts in the game itself.
