Turned out to just be a protective spirit. He wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúgood‚Äù, he was more of a neutral energy. It‚Äôs actually a really strange and long story. Short version is I didn‚Äôt feel his presence or have contact with him for a while. During that time, around age 25, I had begun to weed out some toxic people in my life, including family. I had another spirit latched on to me that was a spy and would watch me and exploit weaknesses in my life. When I got rid of the family members in my life causing problem...the Hatman ATE that spy spirit. When I say that, I mean I was meeting up with a friend, who is a medium, for coffee about once a month. She said the spy spirit just flat out did not exist any longer. She could not sense his energy anywhere! Hatman just sent his ass to the void apparently, and then left. I guess his work in my life was done.
I‚Äôve read he is assigned to children dealing with divorce or dysfunctional families. Maybe once I took matters into my own hands and started healing myself from family problems, his job was done. Spirits are wild man."

It‚Äôs hard to really explain but I have a feeling you probably know what I mean.

Anyway, this is the vessel you have for the time being. Try to think of some of the advantages that come with your spirit being carried temporarily thru this life experience by a body and not so much seeing it as a meat puppet to your brain. When I meditate, I imagine my soul becoming gold liquid and leaving my head to flow into my veins into my whole body to blend them together as one. And then I do something nice for my body that my spirit will appreciate. Lately I have also tried to outwardly express thru my appearance what I think my soul looks like.
