oddlysatisfying,fplgww4,t1_fpletf3,1588712498.0,"I need you to imagine what it's like in a depressed persons head for a day, not *your head* a depressed persons head.

You wake up wishing you hadn't, have to spend half an hour forcing your legs to move because you're so tired it feels like your legs will shatter when they hit the floor. You hate being alive so much that at this point a messy house/room is nothing, you hate yourself so much you feel as though you don't deserve to sleep in a clean bed.

Being depressed isn't a choice and it certainly *isn't* just laziness. It's a debilitating mental illness that can make something as seemingly easy as cleaning a room feel like climbing a mountain."
