I couldn’t choose an install. I don’t know Man. I couldn’t change shit. Just popped up with the fucking error. I couldn’t choose shit, the os came with the prebuilt.   

I’m sending a link because I don’t think you understand. And Ik the monitor disgusting. https://youtu.be/5VMb3RNgRgQ"
techsupport,fkbicnq,t1_fkbcaqd,1584033537.0,It didn’t show anything except for the error when I turned it on. I’m guessing just install not upgrade.
techsupport,fkbbxev,t1_fkb8eom,1584030126.0,The os came with the prebuilt. I couldn’t set any custom install. And I am not deleting partitions. (It’s windows 10 if that adds anything)

depression,fha6oka,t3_f1x3d4,1581398766.0,"Mine was yesterday, I wanted to kill myself then and right now. But I feel as if I can't. My   dissociative identity disorder wants me to wait a week. Certain voices telling me to right now and others saying wait a week. Either way, Yes."

I'm not sure why I haven't off'd myself yet. I guess it is just not the right place and time to."
iwanttokillmyself,fdghvx8,t3_e8xp6x,1578397487.0,"I attempted suicide a few times, and they all failed. My most recent one ended me up in a psychiatric ward and that didn't help. Try to live until you can't take life anymore. Just don't commit suicide..."
iwanttokillmyself,fdgbpzf,t3_eh9qpw,1578388944.0,"Try to get help before deciding that you do want to end your life if everything fails. 

&#x200B;

On a side note, if you have tried everything; a gun or jumping from a cliff is usually an easy way. But please, try to get help."
iwanttokillmyself,fdgbjeu,t3_el70ax,1578388678.0,"Okay look. Suicide can be a way to escape it all, something I want to do at a soon date. Though before you attempt suicide in any way, you should talk to your closest friends about the issues, try to get it off your chest. If you don't have any friends, I guess you could try to talk more over the internet. Try to meet people who can help you out. Or you could perhaps call a hotline. Though when I had extreme thoughts of killing myself, I had called the hotline myself and it didn't help me. I tried through friends and it helped a little. Though it ended with me being sent to a psychiatric ward.

Being in a psychiatric ward can help people. Even people who feel they can't continue. My personal experience in a psych ward was intriguing and helped me feel a bit better about my life. Though it was a hard experience. If you really need help, try to check yourself into one. It helps certain people unlike me.

About the bullying, just try to fucking ignore them. I know how it feels, and after awhile I realized just not to fucking listen to them. And for the feeling like you are a disappointment to your family. I guess try to talk to them more. If it doesn't work, just try not to think about it, don't think about killing yourself or attempting suicide.

Honestly man, if you have anyone to talk to, do it, it helps out. The internet is a good way to talk and discuss if people despise you.

Don't kill yourself unless you can't turn your life around like me. And I feel like you can."

depression,fbtvpcc,t3_eefr7r,1577098419.0,"Well, yes of course. For the past few weeks its been happening to me. And it is really split in half."
depression,fbtvcza,t3_ee8ixe,1577097891.0,"To be completely honest. I actually plan on ending it in 2020. In February. There's just so fucking much to deal with overall. All I do now a days is just a complete lie. Fake life, fake happiness. Friends and family know I am depressed. I went to a fucking psychiatric ward for threats of suicide in school and in dms. For people who may read this and wonder my age, I am 15. Life is just fucking me over so badly. Everything is stacked against me, everything is just.. Me wanting to give up. I choose February because of a certain date. A date which is nearly 3 years ago so dear to me. I had witnessed my closest friends suicide with a knife over a video call on Skype. But anyways. I know damn well I won't survive for long during 2020. And I feel like it is a fucking good thing that I won't. Like I am just a waste of space and living overall. I am someone who doesn't deserve to live anymore, I am just a burden to friends and family. During this past decade, nobody noticed I was down for 2 fucking years. I attempted suicide twice within those years. Nobody cared when I asked for help with mental issues through friends. I can just tell every day when talking to friends that I am actually fucking worthless and that I should be dead. Nobody really fucking cares for me, I know it to be true. I know people will reply and shit saying ""Oh don't kill yourself it's not worth it"" ""Suicide isn't the answer"". Well, it fucking is and it is my only way to be fucking free from my fucking life."
depression,fbfyqjn,t3_ecx5n6,1576826105.0,"I have no idea for sure, does anyone? The past decade was indeed for shit for me. Sadness for awhile and friend's suicides. I honestly don't know if I'll even get to 2021. 2020 perhaps, I don't know. I'm in a low spot right now in my life. Anything could happen. Though the 2010s were shit."

depression,fbfyix3,t3_eczhm3,1576825848.0,"Honestly, just visit your friend. If only 1-2 people are are visiting her, it would still be insanely lonely. I know what it feels like. I was once in a psychiatric ward for teenagers who attempted suicide. I had gotten no visitors from friends but only a little from family. I would have rather had friends, and if I were you. I'd go regardless of what your family said about it. Ruin Christmas if you have to. Just go visit her. It would most likely mean a lot."
depression,fb3pq68,t1_fb3p0p0,1576482704.0,"i dont want things to change even though they are, I want things to seem like they were just before my death in 2 months from now.. i dont know anymore or why i dont want fucking help. theres just like a line in my head that wont cross for help. its pushing me towards suicide. i have stopped it 3 times before. and i dont know if i can do it again. nothings helping. i said 2 months because that is the worst date for me, well for the past 2 nearly 3 years."

and tbh, im starting to snap."
depression,fb3o13e,t3_eban8q,1576480464.0,I had decent though basic enjoyable times during the 2010s. Honestly it was terrible. And i'll probably not survive into the 2020s. I'm at the end of the rope at this point. Cya...
depression,fb3jrsa,t1_fabxujp,1576475557.0,"There is a way about me, that I can not describe. It hurts to even talk about with my closest and dearest friends to me. There is just something, it is indescribable. Lying I guess keeps me sane in a way. I feel as if I do not need help from doctors and therapists. I want to keep my life the same way it has been for my entire life. Dark and enjoyable to a certain sense. For a fact, I know damn well that the end is close to me, on my own terms in roughly two months. I am sorry if this may seem confusing though I am just writing from thoughts and feelings back to you. There is nothing that will stop me from lying to all I know on a personal level to seem like everything is okay. And that nothing will be ever wrong again. Though in fact, there is something wrong with me, I have snapped three times before, and the next time I do, will probably be on my death date. I don't know if anyone ever sees this, or replies. I might if they do, even if they try and insist on getting me help. And just to mention while I am here, therapy isn't for me. Going to a psychology ward wasn't helpful, it drove me more down the path of insanity. I will never get help again. It wouldn't help me either way, I am too far gone."

During my time there, i lied why I was there, that I was joking. I lied to everyone I know. The doctors and therapists alike. In the next few days I might just take a hike and end it. Honestly I feel fucking worthless. I just keep lying to keep it to myself. Nothing has helped me in the past 2 & a half or so years. I'm genuinely surprised I've been alive this long."
