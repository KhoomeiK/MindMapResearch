I can sense when someone is not interested, or wants to talk/be friends with me. So I get anxious and default to no talking. 
I take medication, and go to therapy, but I'm 32 and it's still there. It's definitely better, but...I feel like me just...hides. 
When I'm alone I'm okay. I'm depressed, and lonely, but not anxious. 
I push away friends because of it. It's crippling, but you're not alone. We're here for ya. ðŸ˜Š"

adhd_anxiety,f54i7wu,t3_dmjr6i,1571983449.0,"Adderall has been pretty successful for me. I take extended release, paired with Buspar for anxiety, and Lamictal for mood stabilizer/bipolar. I do tend to focus more, and have the motivation to do stuff. However, if you take it, don't expect to just chill out. You will be up doing stuff. I tend to hyper focus, which is good, but also makes me antisocial. That also goes with the social anxiety. 

I will get tired around 3:30, 4. I will crash pretty hard. If I don't take it, I get really scatter-brained, forgetful, lose focus...

I say, it's worth it, but definitely consult with a doctor. I had to stop all cafiene due to racing heartbeat. 

I was on Ritalin before Adderall, and wooo boy. Those were some terrible times. I locked myself in my room for two days, in complete darkness. On Christmas. I didn't contact my parents, I didn't eat...and my doctor gave me Xanax to deal with the anxiety. I became dependant on Xanax, and I cannot take it anymore."
