I lie awake at night going over and over things I‚Äôve said to people, hoping that I‚Äôm not being an asshole without realizing it or being stupid or whatever else.

reddeadredemption,fowk98r,t3_g9wsbr,1588121421.0,"At first I really wanted to like it but was having a hard time because the controls and lifelike mechanisms of the game were confusing and overwhelming to me (Goddamn O‚ÄôDriscolls riding up on me and shooting me within an inch of my life when I‚Äôm just trying to harvest wild carrots in PEACE) they were different from other games I‚Äôve played, (and admittedly I‚Äôd always try to play while super baked). I‚Äôm kinda embarrassingly soft so I don‚Äôt like having to break into peoples houses and do mean stuff but after taking a break for a few months I came back to it and got used to the controls finally and it really stole my heart and is in my top 3 favorite games!!

When I was 18-20 I went on and off of the ketogenic diet and lost a ton of weight and also started having regular periods again, which I imagine was an indication that my testosterone levels were down due to lower insulin levels, though I didn‚Äôt understand the correlation at the time. I will start a low carb diet rather than a fully ketogenic diet today, and I may try to get on metformin very soon as well.

Thank you for the side note. I‚Äôm glad to hear that you‚Äôre feeling better emotionally and I hope you continue to feel good. Maybe I will feel even better too if I‚Äôm able to get my insulin and testosterone levels under control. I feel more hopeful now"
