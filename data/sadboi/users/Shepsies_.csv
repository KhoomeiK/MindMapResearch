We found the occasional playboy in an abandoned treehouse or something in the woods. We didn’t have the internet. Now don’t get me wrong, I’d fucking love to have the internet. As a kid, that would’ve opened up a shit ton of new doors. But the shit you find on there just turns me off the idea of it. I’m just glad it’s pretty easy to see past it if you don’t pay attention. And as stated earlier, years ago porn was porn. Anthropomorphic animals in cartoons were something to laugh at. The two never intersected, aside from in some lonely artists home."
