SuicideWatch,ewy7wgb,t3_cqof3e,1565876419.0,"Read thru the comments and kudos to all

I‚Äôm 33. A college dropout gas station employee. My dad had fists the size of bricks but he never landed a blow because I was a runner. Ran away at 17. Came home at 23 and my dad had lost his wife(my mom) to another man and remarried. His new wife was an absolute dear. She saw me for who I was and without much convo we had a mother/son connection. 

College life is about showing out. As cheesy as it sounds it‚Äôs about ‚Äúbeing a lady in the streets, a chef in the kitchen, and a prostitute in the bedroom‚Äù. My suggestion is to diversify your friend group. Grab the loners. Bring em in. Be an entertainer across the hall from this fair weather girlfriend you once had. Make her miss you and then move on. She is the one that messed up. I‚Äôm sure her quick scoff and eye roll at the room

If the world can‚Äôt trust me with small things why would it trust me with big things? 32 hours a week at any endeavor is nothing to bat an eye at. 32 hours playing chess?
