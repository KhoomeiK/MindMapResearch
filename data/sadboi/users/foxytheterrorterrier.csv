TrueOffMyChest,fog30un,t1_fofguw0,1587747180.0,"The last time I searched on a porn sight, I was watching a video and then I noticed an ad on the bottom that was CP. This was just on pornhub. I haven't looked at porn since. I can't unsee it and I am also a victim of sexual violence so, its not worth risking my mental health and possibly somehow participating in exploitation."
GenderCynical,fofi433,t1_fockky9,1587736375.0,"The reality is LGBT people are more likely to just let their kid be whoever they are. The vast majority of people who try to force their children to grow up to be not trans or not gay are cishet people with bad morals. I guess that fact upsets them either because they had it done to them, or they plan on doing it to their children and know its wrong"
GenderCynical,foba38v,t1_foardb1,1587657691.0,"People sacrifice a lot to have children. It just is a matter of wanting a child more than you want to not feel dysphoric

I am not trans but I had to go off all my PTSD and anxiety medications to have my daughter. I was extremely uncomfortable mentally and had a lot of times where I wasn't sure if it was worth it. But it was and she's perfect and now we're all okay.

Is it really that surprising someone may choose to suffer increased dysphoria for a couple of years for the sake of a child? *Really?!?* People do things like this ALL THE TIME. People do hard, uncomfortable and painful things for children. That's fucking life."
