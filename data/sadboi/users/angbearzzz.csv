Whats interesting is i have done that before but not for my body and i think that is a challenging but probably very rewarding way to give myself some love! Thank you again! ‚ù§"

Im not gonna lie my faith in you as person goes down when I see that crap. Keep in mind im not against words of encouragement im all for it but some people are just full of shit with that."
AskReddit,fo9cvmw,t1_fo9cbbp,1587616114.0,Fucking right!!!!!! I think we are literally the most lonely generation always complaining we have no one. But most of those same people never put any effort to making friends and you talk to them they look at you wierd or flake off before they have even given you a chance. Like i get its hard sometimes but you gotta put at least a little bit of effort to reach out.
AskReddit,fo9c8g0,t1_fo9c2wl,1587615641.0,Yup.... i feel that too.
AskReddit,fo9by74,t1_fo9bncs,1587615439.0,I am a student. And i swear even just introducing myself they look at me like im a murderer. All i wanted was to see if i could establish a friendship and have good rapport. But people are so hostile even towards an introduction.

NoStupidQuestions,fnt2fsz,t3_g3m3z4,1587233326.0,"No it isn't. Being an adult doesn't mean you stop being creative. In fact, without creativity the harsh world of adulthood would swallow you up. I love anything that has to do with fantasy worlds, i love role playing, i love thinking up different stories and if they are good enough i might even write about them. If i didn't have those things i think I'd feel even more lost. I like lots of things from my childhood that i still engage in , cartoons, collecting items, writing in a diary ect., and i don't feel any shame about it because i think its more normal than what society wants you to think. Its a complete lie that when you grow up you must lose all the color inside your mind. If it makes you happy and helps you function better then just do it."
MakeNewFriendsHere,fnnm6fy,t1_fnnkqyl,1587095677.0,Yes i have i like it! Waiting patiently for the new album. Aw You should try listening to some of those. Idk if you will like them but its worth a try. Also if you have anything to suggest let me know cuz i love finding music i have possibly not heard yet.
MakeNewFriendsHere,fnnkkae,t3_g29gz6,1587094555.0,"Personally i love 60's and 70's music so much. Joan baez, simon and garfunkel, the byrds, greatful dead, linda perhacs, cat stevens, nick drake, jim croc to name some. I also like other decades as well but i think that those two might be my timeless favourites. I am not a huge fan of 90's pop but i do like rock and r&b from then. I also like 2000's rock and r&b as well which are kinda nostalgic for me. I love the killers!! but im not gonna lie i kinda am not super crazy about their stuff after the album battleborn. Have you ever heard brandon flowers solo albums, i really like flamingo!"

Periods,fnmo30e,t3_g2f8at,1587074946.0,"Yes, i do.. i get extremely sad before and during my period. Sometimes i just start crying and i don't know why its happening. And it does make my anxiety worse sometimes it turns into full on paranoia like i start thinking im actually going die if i go to sleep. I think it has to do with the hormone changes, they wreck havoc on your mental health but i have heard from others that it can drive their mind crazy as well."

NoStupidQuestions,fnm75kg,t3_g2lofk,1587066267.0,"Are you talking about the bird or a robot??? If its a bird just try giving it treats they like to encourage good behavior, like if they get out of the cage or step on ur finger.

MakeNewFriendsHere,flm2i6o,t3_fpiblk,1585273071.0,"I can understand how you feel. I am in my mid 20's now and i hate my birthday, i basically pretend it does not exist. But actually i still feel like a very young girl in a lot of ways. That used to bother me more but now i accept that is how i am. Goes hand in hand with the age is just a number thing. You getting older does not always mean you have to be an entirely diffrent person. I am basically as i was at 16 with similar hobbie  personality traits except for other experiences and knowledge i have gained since then.
 
As far as the fear of getting older thing. I think there comes a point of acceptance. I am not quite there yet. But somethings gotta give right? Eventually that feeling will grow tiring and you may give up on it and except the fate we all have to live with. Just know there are certain parts of your younger self that you are allowed to preserve and if they make you happy, keep hold them as best as you can!

Also keep in mind 19 is very young don't waste these years feeling old cuz when you are 40 you might look back and think how silly you were to not realize that. Worrying about age truly is a waste, and a robber of joy."
