I have mental health issues and lingering PTSD and stuffed animals have always helped. If anyone gives you shit tell them to suck a nut"
Advice,fc8pg2b,t3_egjzh0,1577539587.0,"Personal trainer here! Can also attest to the fact that most people are too busy with their own workout to notice others, BUT I totally get gym nerves so here goes.
- get to gym in gym clothes, head into the locker room and lock up your stuff (bring a lock just in case) but make sure you bring a water bottle and maybe a small towel if your gym doesn't provide. 
- if you're goal is just to ease into the environment, cardio machines for the win! Hop on a treadmill or elliptical or tower or whatever and spend 20-30 minutes going at a pace you can maintain but is also challenging (I like to say you should be able to speak but not sing) and if you have questions about how to use the equipment, ask someone at the desk! It's usually part of their job to help out. Also, dont forget to spray and wipe down the equipment afterwards
- if you would rather do some weight training and delve more into that, I would suggest easing in with a 5-10 minute cardio warmup (on a treadmill walking at an incline if possible) then using one weight machine per major muscle group - ie the chest press machine, lat pulldown machine, hamstring curl machine, and leg press - at a weight that makes you strain but not feel like you're gonna die. Do 3 sets of 10-12 reps each machine and dont forget to wipe them down when you're done!
- after, cool down with a nice lil stretch in an open area in the gym (I just say do what makes you feel good in terms of stretching for however long suits you) and head back to the locker room, get your stuff, and TADA!!! You crushed it. 

Feel free to PM me with any questions!!!"
