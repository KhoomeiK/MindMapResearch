(metal) Drum mixing in particular has me quite confused --Regarding the drum peaks (yes they're hat, kick (2 samples), and mainly snare), I was simply trying to get them to cut through the rest of the mix.  For the snare, I'm currently using [this plugin](https://imgur.com/a/YFyF2uv) to try and make things simpler in regards to simply finding a tone i like..

There's currently no group processing on the drums, as I haven't had any luck with it.. I did tinker with parallel processing, but that just made the drums louder, not clearer, which didn't help with anything..

But you're saying it's likely an EQ and compression problem? When you say 'too much dynamic range' on the drums, wouldn't reducing the drum peaks cause them to disappear from the mix as I have it currently set up by ear?

Sorry if this makes no sense, clearly I'm still struggling with the basics after all these years lol"
