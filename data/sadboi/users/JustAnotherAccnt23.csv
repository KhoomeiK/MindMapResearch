adultsurvivors,foyafjs,t3_g9uxq3,1588168822.0,I wish there was a quick spell too! More than anything. I'm sorry. This beyond sucks. It happens to me too. I freeze up and it leads to just this spiral of events for me.

adultsurvivors,felq7zp,t3_ept0y3,1579228280.0,Feel free to message me. About anything!
adultsurvivors,fei9kx6,t3_eozmqi,1579133346.0,"I just told my mom as well and am experiencing a lot of the same feelings. Something that has been helping me was some advice given to me by my therapist: don't forget who's at fault here. You DESERVE to have your story told. You DESERVE the truth to be known. You DESERVE your mom's love and support. That love/support your mom is giving you/will give you is unlike anything else, it will help heal you. And you deserve to heal. 

&#x200B;

Message me if you ever want to talk about anything."
adultsurvivors,fedwflk,t1_fedsxau,1579021325.0,"Thank you! I appreciate your time reading my post and replying to me.

After I posted this I actually journaled some more personal stuff I didn’t want on here. It helped. In the middle of writing it out I caught myself saying, “what the heck!” and my thinking quickly changed."
adultsurvivors,fbzpey0,t3_eefh2z,1577255111.0,Secret Survivor says that remembering is the exception. Way more common to forget and remember later or never at all.
adultsurvivors,fauejau,t1_fao3k3y,1576347289.0,Feel connections as in relationships I have with others? Like see if they’d want a substitute me? Sorry confused by your comment and don’t want to miss some good advice!
adultsurvivors,fa0uuwd,t3_e6z8nt,1575760530.0,"Well, I am no where in your place regarding forgiveness I am in awe of you. You sound like a really awesome person with a good heart! Good for you for even having the desire to want to forgive. It sounds like you've come a long way and you should seriously be proud of yourself. I hope you get the right advice here and are able to be where you want with this."
adultsurvivors,fa0qrk5,t1_fa0qf33,1575758858.0,"Yup. They were seeking out kids like me. 


I do believe it was wrong of me, but they are also in the wrong. Tons of monsters out there."
adultsurvivors,f9lmugv,t1_f9lm5qk,1575426915.0,"Thank you for your reply. It makes sense. It’s just - a lot! I’m trying to just say it’s part of the process, take a break, it’s okay. Lots of self talk around it, but ugh. Definitely getting tired. And definitely see it would be “easy” to just quit working thorough this. 



Now that you mention numb that has me thinking -I have been going in and out of being numb. Like something really upset me and I was angry and hurt by it..,,and then I just didn’t care a single bit about it a few minute later. Wasn’t a  conscious effort by any means."
adultsurvivors,f8qv8aw,t1_f8quud3,1574725057.0,"Thank you! 

I currently am seeing someone. She’s very very VERY good. This has come up more between sessions and really freaked me out. I plan on bringing this up with her for sure, but this place always helps me with things as well. Appreciate your time!"
adultsurvivors,f8quopk,t1_f8p1705,1574724670.0,Sounds like you’re very self aware. And are able to really help yourself! Thank you for your reply. I’ll keep at trying to stay present.
adultsurvivors,f8qu8k6,t1_f8ogfno,1574724353.0,"Totally understand that. 


I’m guess we feel exhausted because it’s a mentally exhausting task? It’s taking a lot of mental power to keep us dissociate. 


I am really worried I have some multiple personality disorder. It just sounds so similar and the way I feel it’s like someone else is going to “come up.”"
adultsurvivors,f8o80be,t1_f8o0q7y,1574666818.0,"Yeah -waves, that’s a good way to put it. Daily as well lately. But I just KNOW I dissociated for longer stretches of time before. Like months? Maybe full years? But lately I’ve been more in/out the more aware I become. 



I will bring it up in my next therapy session."
adultsurvivors,f8o7vsb,t1_f8o3pa7,1574666651.0,"Thank you so much for your reply! 



I completely understand the “oh in disappearing and I’m not going to come back” part. That’s it EXACTLY. 


I’m in therapy and this just started to unfold for me more after my last session. I plan on bringing it up with her for sure. And will try to log episodes as well."
adultsurvivors,f8o0kyh,t1_f8o0el0,1574658377.0,"Wow. Okay, well I ah e felt crazy for feeling this way but now I want to say it’s crazy to hear you talk about it and know EXACTLY what you mean. It’s like you’ve experienced it just like me. You’re even better at describing it than I am. 



So, I’ve tried to meditate a lot. But this one course kept making me “leave my body” and I would get SO freaked out that I wouldn’t be able to find my way back. Just kind of a heads up if you ever try this."
adultsurvivors,f8o09q8,t1_f8nzxvf,1574658081.0,"YES! Which leads me to wondering if I’m going even real. I feel made up, if that makes any sense"
adultsurvivors,f8nyg5g,t1_f8nkiql,1574656407.0,"Grounded has helped me before deal with a similar aspect -re-experience the abuse as if it were happening. I’ll give this all a shot! Willing to do anything really. 


Thank you so much for taking the time to read and reply to me! You’re reply actually helped a lot and I’ll definitely be re-reading it for ongoing encouragement.



Edit; also yeah, I totally get needing a “break” and sometimes I’m really grateful to be dissociating!"
adultsurvivors,f8nycai,t1_f8ntnvc,1574656314.0,"That’s interesting. I know I have full on conversations with myself too. Sometimes half outloud, half silently -but no real pattern like you’re saying. 

Do you ever feel like someone else while doing it? Like you’re one version and maybe there’s another version who’s talking back?"
adultsurvivors,f8ny7tp,t1_f8nkv4q,1574656207.0,"Thank you for your reply, advice, and time! 

Yeah. Definitely happens during flashbacks or when I’m thinking about my past abuse. But does it ever just happen kind of randomly to you? Or when you get hurt emotionally by something unrelated?"
adultsurvivors,f8ny0ja,t1_f8nfom3,1574656033.0,"Yeah, I get some of that too. It’s almost being high on MJ -like I’m going, “whoa are they still taking?”"
depression,f802emn,t3_dpl4bu,1574119827.0,"Wow. I just came here to post something very similar. I’ve gotten recent comments on how well I’m doing and it’s frightening -that I can fool those closest to me. My depression is getting worse, and yet I’m getting even better at covering it up."
