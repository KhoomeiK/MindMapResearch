Yes, growing your own food is very labor intensive but the entire chain of food being grown to food in your belly is very short and simple. Next compare that to buying at a farmer's market. Not as simple but the biggest step you add is just getting to the farmer's market. Now think about processed food found in a supermarket and the entire process it took for that food to reach you. And it's not even just the logistics of getting the food to you but also all the marketing and research to get you to purchase that food item.

I don't plan to go back to a normal job once everything is back open.

I don't know if I'll want to live in one of these communities forever but I really want to know how to survive off the land just in case I have to later. I've watched enough post-apocalyptic sci-fi to make me paranoid about the future. I plan to use my time off-grid to learn as much as possible about homesteading and living off the land.

I've been slowly decluttering my life, both physically and mentally. I've been letting go of past selves and fantasy selves. Moving into a really small living space (121 sq ft) has really forced me to figure out what's important in my life and I highly recommend it if one gets the chance."
ShitLiberalsSay,fpvfh2n,t3_gfrbaz,1588943601.0,"I mean there are collectivist groups in America where you can live in a ""socialist Utopia"" but there are very few of them and most of them are located in rural areas. I plan to move to one. But not everyone has the privilege/ability to move across the country to live in the woods. There has to be a better way."
simpleliving,fpukxnv,t3_gfimal,1588915656.0,You can achieve simple living anywhere. I practice simple living and I live in a room in a major metro area. Simple living isn't just homesteading. I feel like it's more of a mindset than anything else.
simpleliving,fpukbki,t3_gfjxok,1588915170.0,"Your post (and some of these comments) make me depressed because it's a reminder how much we're brainwashed to value money over happiness. 

There are many jobs/careers that will provide financial independence besides law. In fact, I think it's a mistake to think that only high-paying jobs allow financial freedom. It's not just how much you make but also how much you spend. You talk about dance, yoga, and language classes being expensive but you can learn all of those for free online. 

I get having immigrant parents who don't want you to struggle or be stressed but I think it's a fool's errand trying for a stress-free life. Yeah if you have a high paying job, you might not be stressed about money, but you'll probably be stressed about not having free time or something else. And besides, would you really want an 100% stress-free, pampered life? 

>  I hate law and I can't imagine myself working in this field or anything related to it.

Time is limited. Do you really want to spend your life doing something you hate?"

With the way the climate is heading, ecological disaster is probably gonna ruin most people's retirement plan. I'll laugh so hard if America collapses and everyone's retirement plan turns to shit. Lol at anyone who thinks investing in the stock market as a retirement plan is a good idea."

For example, I haven't paid directly for internet in the past 3 years. For a while I would just walk to a nearby cafe if needed to use the internet on my laptop. I then paid my neighbor $15/month to use his login credentials. Next my friend gave me his xfinity hotspot info for free and I can connect to any xfinity hotspot (there's one in range). Finally the apartment building behind my building just started offering it's residents free wifi. I'm close enough to connect and the signal is better than the xfinity hotspot.

I've paid about $90 for internet over the course of 3 years and have zero regrets about my internet connection."

Sounds like your dresser isn't working for you. Maybe find a low dresser or use a vanity as a dresser or just get rid of it if you have a closet. I personally haven't had a dresser since I've moved out."
