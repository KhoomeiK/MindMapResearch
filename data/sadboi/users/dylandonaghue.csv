NPD,fr17tif,t1_fr0yqcv,1589814878.0,"That is definitely a bias, and not based on fact. 

Women do not have an easier time of things. Pretty women often feel insecure and worthless inside; perhaps they believe that if it weren't for their good looks, they would have no value at all. Good looks are fleeting, and many women feel that once they develop wrinkles and gray hair, they will be less desirable. I look at all the women and young girls posting selfies as a sign of some form of narcissism. Some of them seem to post a new selfie every day; they are just clamoring for attention. They seek to validate themselves constantly through appearances.

""They also seem to get blamed less for unhealthy relationships""

Listen to just about any song by a male artist or group about break-ups and you will hear women and girls referred to as ""evil"", ""bitch"", ""whore"", ""man-eater"", ""leading the guy on"", ""wicked woman"", and other misogynist terms. Even referring to a woman's vocalizations as ""bitching"" is misogynist, because you're slapping a negative label on her expressing herself. If you wanted to give it a more positive slant, you could simply say that she's not a nice person.

...

One thing you are absolutely correct about is that it's more socially acceptable for a woman to cry about her feelings. I am working to resolve that by allowing my two sons to cry or express any feeling they want to under my roof, and not shaming them for it. Enough with telling boys and men to hide their feelings."

I have always felt that every person, regardless of gender, skin colour, cultural background, sexuality, or economic station in life, deserves a fair chance. These people were calling ME racist, and that's just more racism perpetuating itself. And the cycle continues."

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in American women, except for skin cancers. 1 in 1,000 men also get breast cancer.

Stop being a baby, and start your own awareness campaign with actual knowledge and statistics, rather than ranting about the unfairness of your life."
AskFeminists,fps7oad,t3_gf1895,1588868848.0,"I've been researching empathy and highly sensitive people and such topics. I think empathy begins with practicing active listening skills. Staying silent while other people talk, really focusing on what they're saying, and trying to imagine the place they're coming from. Don't wait for the person to finish, so you can get your word in. Just listen. Oh, also, mindfulness can help you to achieve active listening. 

I fully believe that men can successfully accomplish this. I have met many men who fit the bill. Myself and my son are highly sensitive people. 

You've made the first step in asking HOW."

It wasn't until the quarantine started that I began to have extremely vivid dreams, usually waking up in a sweat. One of them was a nightmare in which my sister fell down an elevator shaft. I actually screamed out loud IRL. And I *never* used to dream like that."

But at the same time, I hate myself, tend to isolate a *lot*, and repress my emotions.

But I do also have a cruel streak, and I like it. So I may have aspects of ASPD. Or maybe I'm more of a malignant narcissist. I haven't decided. 

The only people I can feel any empathy for are my 2 sons, or people who are as messed up as I am."
