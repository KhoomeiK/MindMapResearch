depression_memes,fp1x1jh,t1_fp1u5co,1588250144.0,"Damn, while i cant truly relate to everything u just said i feel you completly . I hope things get better for you. My girlfriend just broke up with me cuz she just fell out of love i guess. She was the first person in my life i completly opened up to and she really took me out of my depression but i guess i was too much of a burden . Idk why im sharing i just find that things are easier to bear when others feel the same way. Just stay strong, you will find the one eventually <3"
