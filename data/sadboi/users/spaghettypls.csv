abortion,flecyci,t3_fny622,1585081987.0,"Same thing happened to me wow!! It sounds like your acne could be due to a hormonal imbalance and maybe the pregnancy hormones helped balance it out? 

Loool I am by no means a doc but I had similar luck with prescribed oral antibiotics that were supposed to help balance stuff out. If you find your acne returning, maybe talk with a dermatologist about that! 

I have a hormonal IUD now so we'll see-- it's only been like 6 weeks for me since my abortion"

You're not stupid-- abortion can be VERY traumatizing but at the end of the day, it is a very common medical procedure. 

I read some stories from the book Shout Your Abortion and many women in there had to have another one. 

Although maybe your body is just freaking out without BC! Keep us updated, sending love!"

Save the suicide hotline in your phone for really bad days, but please try to go easy on yourself.

Here if you need to talk, love. Itll be okay ♡"
abortion,flbpwwk,t1_flbpe86,1585009920.0,"For mine, I was about 5 weeks in and opted for the medical abortion route w/ the pills. At my appointment, I took the first pill which didnt make me feel any different. They'll usually tell you a time to take the second set of pills the next day-- there are a few ways of administering them but the most effective is to tuck them in your cheeks for 30 minutes (they'll show you). 

Everyone reacts very differently after taking the pills. Not going to lie, it was pretty painful for me until I smoked weed and my body relaxed enough to pass what it needed to. But everyone is different and some people say it just feels like a heavy period. It takes a couple hours I'd say and then I bled like I was on my period for like, two weeks maybe. 

Besides the physical part, expect your emotions to be all over the place. I asked the nurse about this at my follow-up and she said ""you'll notice you have really good days and really bad days, but the good ones will start to outnumber the bad."" That's been pretty accurate!"

I'm not a doctor, but I did ask two."
AnorexiaNervosa,fl863ag,t3_fn701y,1584916649.0,"Hey honey, take a breath real quick. 

I have been in an extremely similar situation and know how you are feeling right now. I was very sick and wanted to die. I became sicker and did almost die! I used to sit there for hours on google: ""Why dont I have a personality?"" Seriously, I felt blank. Like I could never do or say or think anything interesting-- I promise it's not true. I stopped going to therapy because I had a wack therapist who would also minimize my problems. 

So first, I want you to know that you're not alone. This is like talking to past-Me. 

Which makes me future-You! I began recovery in October. The word ""recovery"" used to terrify me. I did gain weight at first. I didnt like myself. And then? My body realized I was eating again and now I look better than I did before when I wasnt eating anything. I never thought that would be possible. It will happen for you. 
I developed a new personality that was more confident than before. I love myself now. That will happen for you, too! I'm really fucking funny and actually capable of lighting up rooms now. I have this huge, loud laugh. Your personality is in there!! It just cant function because you're in survival mode. Your brain power is being used to count calories and hate yourself-- once you give your body something to work with, your personality will flourish. I promise, like Pinky Promise I mean that. It will happen. 

Please-- you dont have to go into full-blown recovery yet. But please, start to be in your own corner. Be on your own team. Rally for yourself-- your personality is in there and it needs you to fight for it. It's not going to be perfect or easy. I'm going back to therapy soon because I've got a whole other set of issues life has thrown at me-- life is still going to be hard. But fuck, I am very happy I let it be hard and not over. 

From future-You: it is going to be okay. At least stick around and see what your personality is like. It's in there, swear. Message me if you ever need to vent."

I wonder what mine would have been like. I have to sometimes remind myself that I made the right decision-- it doesnt necessarily make it easier. 

My friend had an abortion, then had a baby, and she said she felt the way we do for awhile. She said itll be okay-- dont put so much pressure on yourself. You'll have a baby someday, love! It will happen. Remind yourself that. Its gonna be okay and I'm here if you ever need to vent."

I just had my follow-up yesterday where I expressed concerns over how depressed I've been, how traumatized I feel, the weird feelings about really wanting a baby that wont go away/crying anytime someone talks about children etc. A lot of these feelings are brand-new to me-- I didnt have to think twice on whether or not I was going to get the abortion. 
The doctors said it a lot of the pregnancy hormones will stick around in your system for a bit. She said I sounded like I was struggling w/ PTSD and that was normal, she said I'd have really extreme emotions and my days would seem either very good or very bad, but that the good days would start to outnumber the bad. 

I also had an IUD inserted at my follow-up and the peace of mind it is bringing me is helping me combat some of these awful fears of having to go through that again ever.

I think they have you wait if you have unprotected sex after your abortion to make sure you're not pregnant again but I told them I've been using condoms so I didnt have to wait. I originally thought I would get the non-hormonal IUD since ive also had traumatic experience with BC pills but they gave me a lot of info about it and it seemed like the best choice. 

The procedure itself was uncomfortable and sort of painful, but really not as bad as I was expecting and I felt completely normal after it was over. Really only a few minutes of it hurting"
abortion,fibpy1f,t1_fibpc9g,1582327392.0,"Yeah seriously mine sounded very similar!!

I'm also in the US/paid out of pocket but I qualified for a free IUD because of my income-- definitely ask about your options if you're curious about birth control at all.

Eating disorders are so personal and secretive that theres a sort of undeniable intimacy shared with anyone in your real life who struggles with the same thing. It doesn't matter who they are. Your comments sound a lot like survivor's guilt almost. I think stories like this resonate so deeply with people who are affected by EDs because she could be any of us. That's an anorexic individual's looming fear and too often a reality-- having your disorder ultimately kill you. How completely awful and devastating and painful to have to deal with. And the fact that her experience is so uniquely hers and that most people dont understand what she went through isolates you in your grief. I'm really sorry for your loss. 

Dont dwell on the guilt though; you are alive and you deserve to be here. Overcoming an ED is excruciatingly difficult, no matter the amount of support or help you have access to. I'll say it again: you deserve to be here.

Disordered eating and eating disorders did make me lose a lot of weight in my attempt to be pretty-- I ended up looking so awful I couldnt even look at myself in the mirror anymore.

AnorexiaNervosa,f8c6l3g,t3_e039lh,1574453637.0,"As someone who has struggled with EDs for 10+ years, I feel you. It can feel like an external problem that you have no control over, especially if you're already in therapy. 

What you can control is how you involve other people in your disorder. Obviously your partner is someone you can and should confide in and share your issues and feelings with, but you also need to recognize that your partner is another person with thoughts and problems of their own. BODY ISSUES OF THEIR OWN. You constantly bringing up the way you feel about your body, especially if it's negative, is unfair and extremely draining to whoever you're involving. 

Not in a youre-a-burden way, but try to take into consideration what you're asking of your partner when you constantly bring up these thoughts. She either has to disagree and try to get you to see things in a different way, which is really draining if you're not open to that, or she has to somehow comfort someone who isnt allowing anything to be okay. 

Not to mention it IS unattractive when someone constantly shits on themselves. It doesn't matter how attractive you actually are-- ANYONE talking negatively about themselves basically flatlines your attraction to them. I have a friend who always complains about his weight and being single and people treating him differently when really, people are turned off by his attitude about himself. It makes people uncomfortable when they feel like they have to build your confidence up for you. My friend doesn't realize that if he didnt outwardly voice his self hatred all the time, it would give others an opportunity to find him attractive. Haven't you ever been attracted to someone you wouldn't normally be attracted to, just because they carry themselves with love and confidence? 

And you know what? Most people work pretty hard to build their own confidence up. People dont WANT people around them who question their own worth or confidence, because those types of negative thought patterns are toxic and easy to pick up. As someone recovering from an ED and finally getting the courage to build my confidence up, I intentionally avoid the friend I mentioned before because his own self hatred attacks my self confidence. 

So yeah, no shit your girlfriend doesn't find you as attractive. You're not giving her an opportunity to. You're drowning her thoughts out with your self-hatred and shes realized that and probably finds it fucking exhausting to try to yell over your negative self talk. She can feel herself losing her voice, probably. She's tired of you giving more energy and attention to your own negativity rather than leaving the door open for positivity to come in.

You dont have to exercise or love yourself right now, just stop constantly bringing up how you dont like yourself. Or when you do, give her some avenue for her voice to be heard. ""I HATE x about myself, but at least I like y."" Then she can take part in the conversation and agree-- she also likes y about you. It doesn't have to be a physical quality. 

Sorry this is such a huge rant; I'm only 7 weeks into recovery but coming out of an ED has made me realize the impact I've had on those around me and why I have zero friends. Save your relationship, it's not too late yet."

No but really, taking that picture would be perfect! That way they know exactly what you're talking about. You can also say you'd like a really natural fade but would like to keep the length on top~"

amiugly,f8443m1,t3_dyvc5v,1574230018.0,"I FEEL U okay I have had cystic acne for forever and have really REALLY similar scarring to you. I feel the same way about wearing a full face every day; it's really difficult for me to leave my house without at least some basic makeup. 

I will say though, honestly? Seeing your post makes me wonder if I'm being too hard on myself. You're gorgeous and really your scarring doesn't impact that much. The only thing I'll say is make sure you keep your blonde hair toned because warm hair colors can bring out pink/red undertones in your skin and make any scarring or redness more noticeable.

But really. I completely understand what you're going through. At least the breakouts themselves are gone 🙏🙏"
amiugly,f843pbx,t3_dyvlj5,1574229593.0,"Oh man well usually I always think guys look better with facial hair, but you're genuinely attractive either way! I think you look older & more mature with a beard or shadow though. 

As for hair: My fave pic is the second one in the w/ beard set-- that's how you should style your hair in my opinion (I also used to be a hairdresser ok 😭💘) 

I dont think you're ugly at all~"
amiugly,f8433de,t3_dytcd5,1574228956.0,"you actually remind me of this russian girl I follow on IG (novlkovayulia). You have very unique features, but you're very symmetrical and striking in my opinion. 
Maybe you feel ugly cause you look different? Idk but to me, I just get a sort of strange-model vibe. Some people are very pretty in a different, less mainstream way. Maybe other people have different opinions, but I'd say you're actually very pretty."
amiugly,f842m6d,t3_dytiro,1574228474.0,"I think glasses generally make people look better because they can help balance out your features. I think you're really cute! I'd grow your hair out a bit and maybe invest in a styling gel. But otherwise, I think you're a lot cuter than you think you are."

I suppose I'm also really biased and it's really hard to unlearn the misplaced anger I have towards certain ways I've been treated by men in the past. 

There definitely is a big difference; I think both are actually about protecting yourself, but generalizing half the population probably isnt the most effective way to do that. Or the most considerate.

For the sake of fairness, I do think that most people do not literally think All Men are trash (even those who put it like that), and a lot of men understand they're not the ones being targeted by these types of messages."

Thank you for this post-- after a traumatic last year, I'm finally putting energy into my friendships and making new friends, but have been struggling with feeling super annoying or unwanted. I think I'm analyzing it too much~"
TrueOffMyChest,f7p9280,t3_dx9bfh,1573945291.0,"I think part of the whole ""all men"" thing stems from the fact that even men who seem trustworthy at first can often prove themselves otherwise, to the point where a lot of people dont trust any guy's intentions. It's easier to generalize when it's not just ""this guy"" or ""many men,"" but in fact ""most men in my life, including my family members, coworkers, and people I thought I had meaningful friendships with."" There aren't clear ""good guys"" and ""bad guys""

I think a lot of women would rather sacrifice offending the few men in their lives that have pure intentions for their personal and emotional safety. 

That being said, I think a lot of men are much more aware of these social issues and conduct themselves with integrity. I have felt a personal shift in how I feel about men, yet I think it might take awhile for us all to get on the same page. I'm sorry it's so rough right now, but I think with time a lot of the hostility directed @ men will dissipate once women feel we've been heard."

Advice,f7p4g8d,t3_dxauvl,1573941893.0,"I honestly never am paying attention to other people when I go to see a movie. I couldnt tell you the % of people who are alone vs. with someone on average, so take comfort in the fact that most others probably dont even notice. 

It's also an easier social thing to do by yourself than other activities; I recently took myself out to dinner and was incredibly anxious the whole time as theres not much to do other than socialize and eat. At least with a movie, you're actively watching the movie and so is everyone else."
