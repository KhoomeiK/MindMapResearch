InsightfulQuestions,fajchw8,t3_e9eyhy,1576131767.0,"The person would be trapped in a body so old,  it's a living death. He wouldn't be able to walk anywhere, so it doesn't mater if he remembers everything. If he's not isolated of almost any human interactions, scientists will find him and conduct tests on him. Let's say he saw almost every major thing in history. This person will likely be completely,  utterly insane. He'd want to die. It's either a life of loneliness, of staring at the ceiling blankly, physical restrictments and pain,  as well as mental inclarity. And this is just what would happen if his body would feel(?) as old as it actually is. 


If, let's say,  he was trapped in a body of a... 50 year old man. He would travel the earth,  see civilisation rise and fall, people live and die. If he won't remember everything,  then he'll feel just like any other. He might continue aging, faster, slower,  maybe at the same pace,  of any other human. If he'll remember everything... Again,  he might be completely mad, but he'll definitely be unpredictable and dangerous. Other than that, this person would probably be an introvert, smart,  experienced, lonely, and ocassionally selfish. I'd add in denial,  but that probably went away around 600 years of age"
