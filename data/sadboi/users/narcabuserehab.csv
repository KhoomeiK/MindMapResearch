He poured the bucket of dirty water over my head. He grabbed me, ripping my shirt and threw me against the dryer. He flew at me in a rage, pummeling me with his fists. I was crying and begging him to stop. He snarled, “your tears are just water to me.” Then spat in my face and left.
I had difficulty crying for a long time afterward. It was because I was deeply traumatized. In school, he was Mr. Congeniality.

In order words, you should practice detachment. Withdraw all judgement and accept the situation as a part of your past. Instead of focusing on her, work on yourself.

Regarding your second goal, if you don't want to think about her stay productive. Get busy on projects you enjoy and that will build up your self-esteem.

NarcissisticAbuse,eu23tph,t3_ceb17z,1563381719.0,"This is a coercive control tactic used by NDPs. It has two objectives:

1.) The Narcissist is grooming your social circle to think of them as a sweet and charming person, and

2.) The Narcissist doesn’t value you. They want you to believe that you’re inferior. They‘re obtaining supply by humiliating, degrading and psychologically torturing you.

The more your abuser breaks you down, the more compliant you’ll be to their whims. The more outsiders they charm, the less people will believe you if you tell your story.

If you don’t have children with your abuser, they have no place in your life."
domesticviolence,eu22lwv,t3_cebnxe,1563380951.0,"Yes, witnessing domestic violence as a child can have long lasting effects into adulthood. It’s deeply traumatic for a child to see their primary caregivers locked in the cycle of violence. The child experiences high levels of fear and anxiety. 

The longer a child is exposed to trauma the more likely they may develop chronic anxiety which can lead to stress related physical and psychological disorders i.e. depression, lupus, PTSD. Not only has the child witnessed acts of violence but they are sworn to secrecy. 

As one parent is obsessed with maintaining power and control, the other parent is fighting for their life. Often the needs of the child(ren) are neglect causing abandonment issues.

This is such a big topic. What’s important is that it’s absolutely possible that you have unprocessed trauma from what you witnessed as a child. Please consider working with a licensed psychotherapist specialized in trauma to work through it.

Finally, no one should have to go through what you and your Mom went through at the hands of your abuser. I’m sorry that happened to you 🧸❤️"
