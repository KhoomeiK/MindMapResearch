AskReddit,fotkfi2,t3_g98cd6,1588056688.0,"When I was a child, let’s say 10 years old I found a VHS porno tape in my brothers VCR. After seeing it I became infatuated with sex.  I didn’t understand that only adults have sex, so with the Internet being a new thing back then (I’m over 30)  I tried to find videos of 10 year olds having sex because I thought everyone had sex lol.   Well, luckily we didn’t get raided or anything but my entire family (grandma, aunts, uncles) sat my brother down and had a VERYYYYY serious conversation about the consequences of those actions. I want to say they even told him Jesus Christ was watching him.   Well, it was meeeeeeeeeeeee. 

Side note:  My brother is fine, he has a family, hard worker and grew up to be a stand up guy."

I would like for them to talk about the good times, what I’m known for, what I meant to people.  I’d like for them to play my favorite songs and share pictures of my journey through life.   It’s my funeral! Lol I’m allowed to be selfish!"
