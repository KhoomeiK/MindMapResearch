Anxiety,fr3kba4,t3_gmezo7,1589859274.0,"almost all of my anxiety is like this, very rarely anymore do i get a super crazy panic attack where i hyperventilate. i didn’t know that an anxiety attack was different, but i get this a lot and it does make it more difficult to explain to others how it feels :("
Anxietyhelp,fpmiw24,t3_ge4ot6,1588734057.0,"Damn near all of my anxiety nowadays is physical symptoms, with like no conscious intrusive thoughts. It’s weird, because sometimes I will get the heart palpitations first, and then start spiraling inside my mind. 

Something that can help at times is if this happens and maybe it’s night and you’re laying down in bed, sitting up helps just a little bit... not totally, but there is an improvement. I’ve been getting into meditation more lately and while I do find some quick relief, it’s not bulletproof (yet). But I have to meditate while sitting up, not lying down. Otherwise I’ll suffer from air hunger until further notice. 

Having an episode of this right now actually, I hope it gets better for you, I really do. To me this is just as bad as a real bad panic attack or depressive episode. Good luck!"
Anxietyhelp,fpmi7ck,t3_gebuly,1588733629.0,"This is my biggest challenge with my anxiety (and adhd). The only thing that’s ever worked is if I just don’t even think about the steps to doing said thing or something and I just do it without having an intrusive thought in my mind. However it’s not that easy and this has only worked for me a few times lol, it still needs work. Currently avoiding my taxes and calling my bank rn. Yay!"
Anxiety,fplbfnf,t3_ge3ztt,1588709716.0,"This is a post that resonates with me especially today, because most of the time my anxiety is all physical, and I won’t even know what brought it on. For me, it’s heart palpitations, mainly.. but I get all of them at some point. I had given up on trying to find things to help, but more recently I decided to give meditation another try. It’s not foolproof for me just yet, and it’s hard to get myself to do it also due to my ADHD, but it does help some. You are not alone my friend, trust me."

Something I’ve noticed that I never had before was the side effect of weight gain.... I am very small so this surprised me. However coupled with a sedentary lifestyle and not eating that great, I should’ve known this would happen. Good news is my depressive episodes have dramatically gone down, so far so good. As long as I don’t gain any drastic weight or anything changes, I’ll probably stay on this for a little while! I’d go back to the pill if this didn’t work, too nervous for an IUD."

anyway, as far as advice for support i would suggest you just stay by his side as much as possible. listen to him if he wants to vent. find a good netflix series to binge on to distract him if he gets bad withdrawals for whatever reason. tell him you don’t think of him any different just because he’s an addict. that’s what i would want from my SO. good luck!"

amiugly,f938hy4,t3_e3i8o3,1575052574.0,you’re not at all ugly. definitely average and some would maybe say above that? don’t have any tips but i think the haircut suits your face well.
