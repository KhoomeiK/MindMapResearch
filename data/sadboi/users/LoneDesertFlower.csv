Another suggestion: if no punishment is assigned in the Policy tab, make it so guards don't escort the prisoners to their cells.


For example: An inmate sets off a metal detector, and a gold pocket watch is discovered. Even though I have no punishments set for finding luxuries, the inmate is cuffed, and has to wait for a different guard to come escort him to his cell. This is a waste of both the guard's and inmate's time. I'd rather the contraband be taken away, then the inmate able to go about his business, hence why I have no punishments for that offense.


Suggestion: Make an actual garbage truck that comes to pick up garbage, and leave the supply truck just for deliveries and exports.


Edit to add suggestion: A deployment tab for support staff (cooks, janitors, gardeners, & workmen). So players can assign individual support staff to work in rooms/areas the players want them in- just like we can with guards.


Make an option to have guard towers open or closed. When a tower is open, a sniper will occupy it (if the player has hired snipers). When it is closed, it stays empty."
prisonarchitect,fgjgn53,t3_eygg4m,1580843641.0,"I close intake at the start until I get my basics built:


-Offices for staff (sans lawyer) and a staffroom


-holding cell


-security, kennel and small armory.


-kitchen, canteen, yard


-chapel


-small laundry


-one parole room


-start with a small cell block with enough individual cells for 20 inmates.


-build a small workshop (leave out carpentry tables)


-later on, build a Forestry and small classroom.


-Turn off cell quality ratings.


-don't hire armed guards or snipers yet.


- I've been not making cleaning cupboards so as to reduce overdose issues. I've found that even with a dog posted right outside the cleaning room, the amount of poisons being stolen got ridiculous.



Placement matters, as you want your rooms close enough that your prisoners (and staff) don't have to travel too far. Have the kitchen, canteen and yard next to to each other and put your cell block so prisoners can leave the block and walk right into the canteen. Place laundry near cell block so prisoners assigned to laundry can move the carts easily into the cell block.


In the canteen, in addition the required objects, I put phones, and sometimes a TV.


I put showers and toilets in the yard, as well as weights, benches, phones and prayer mats. I'll put a radio there as well.


Put a radio in areas prisoners work: shop, workshop, laundry, cleaning cupboard, mail room.


When I first open intake, I set it so I only receive Minimum security prisoners. They're docile for the most part, so you can run your prison relatively uninterrupted. Plus, with only minimum security, you don't have to worry about snitches and ex-cops being attacked. Once you start bringing in Medium Sec and higher, you have to build a separate wing for Protected Custody and keep those inmates completely isolated.


Guards:  Too many guards can make your inmates unhappy. For Minimum sec, figure 1 guard per 25 prisoners, plus a couple extra to relieve guards who are tired. Five regular guards and 5 dogs are good to start. When you start adding door controls, CCTV and phone taps, factor in guards to man those devices.


-Regime:  For Minimum and Med sec, I schedule free time from 4-5AM so they can shower, toilet, pray, etc as they wish. Eat from 5-6 so they're fed before parole hearings start. Yard from 6-7. Work/free time from 7am-1pm. Eat from 1-2pm. Free time from 2-3. Work/free time from 3-8. Eat 8-9pm. Yard 9-10. Free time from 10-11pm (most go to sleep by choice). Then lockdown from 11pm-4am (they'll relax, read, sit, toilet, sleep as they choose).


Luxuries is a need satisfied by the shop (or contraband such as phones or gold watches). To get luxuries legally, prisoners need to buy them at the Shop. For that, they need money. So, as long as you have prisoners assigned to work, they make money and can buy luxuries during work/free time if the shop is manned. When you start getting gang members in your prison, unhappiness about luxuries will happen, because gang members don't work. And if you rightly prevent gangs from taking over common rooms and yards, the gangs can't extort money from other prisoners. So gang members will start complaining about having no luxuries- when they start fussing too much, clamp them on lockdown until they shut up."
