depression,fbsnjyg,t1_fbq6jg9,1577057643.0,"Once you accept it you can start healing and focus on what you do have. Build up your support system, family doesn't have to be blood. Family is who loves you and accepts you, supports you and has compassion towards you. Look for those people in your life and spend more time with them. You'll be okay. It might not feel like it now but you will. Give it time and try to have compassion towards your mom. You don't know what inner demons she might be battling herself."
depression,fbq5p6q,t3_ee58qm,1577028532.0,"My mom does the same thing to this day and I'm 35. It took me a long time to understand that the way she behaves is 100% about her. I mourned the loss of the mother daughter relationship I wanted, and accepted the one I do have. 

Now I can see that it is her way of processing things she is u comfortable with. She has her own undiagnosed mental health problems and a lot of it is deflecting.  

The pain and sting of hearing your mom say things about your mental health is awful and I wish you didn't have to feel it. 

Just know that you are enough the way you are. She doesn't define your worth, you do."
Teachers,erk8ft1,t3_c29od1,1560957774.0,Thank GOD we don't have graduation at my school.  We do a clap-out. All the classes line the hallways while the 6th grade class walks the halls one last time. We also invite any graduating seniors that went to our school and they wall the halls in their cap and gown. It's quite beautiful!

AmItheAsshole,epothjt,t1_eposurs,1559353059.0,I never said anything about it being unfair to me. I didn't reply with how far the drive is bc it doesn't matter.

AmItheAsshole,epot7di,t1_eposh50,1559352804.0,The terms of the plea deal would have had him driving over 6 months ago if he took it.
