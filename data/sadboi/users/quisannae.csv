MrRobot,fncyzwf,t1_fncyunf,1586852255.0,Totally understand why. (Although it is weird to be friends with a disgraced nuclear physicist who is  4x your age ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)
MrRobot,fncypf9,t3_g0j8ub,1586851946.0,My all time favourite episode. When I found out that he loves BTTF (my all time fav film) I literally started crying. üíïü•∞
mentalhealth,fmvf5d5,t3_fxjzaq,1586414847.0,Fantastic! Keep on going! Jamming to music is always good. You got this!!! ü•≥
Psychosis,fmru8xc,t3_fwy5ek,1586335665.0,Happy birthday! I wish you a wonderful and cheerful day!
Psychosis,fmru6nv,t3_fx221e,1586335598.0,"Getting because of a medical condition is absolutely wrong. This is not how you deserve to be treated. 

I wish you all luck and hope that thinks work out well for you. Take care!"
Psychosis,fmm8y9v,t3_fvyogz,1586200987.0,"You are not alone! You can get through this and I know it is very very frightening. 
Find a way to cope with stress.
I like to draw to cope with stress. You can find something like that for you too. Like a way to relax for a bit and clear your head. Whether that is gardening or painting or cleaning. Whatever you like!
You can also talk about it (which is very scary at first) if you are in a safe environment. Or a crisis hotline is also always there for you. 
It is not a shame to go through this and you are allowed to open up about it.

I wish you all luck!!!"
MrRobot,fkx2l44,t1_fkwvdnb,1584616408.0,"In the finale Krista mentioned that Elliot developed the mastermind later in life (She says something like half a year ago or smth) and that the other three were formed in early childhood. I don‚Äôt know if you can develop another personality without a trauma  if you already have other alters (like you said, through a ripple effect). That is why this seems odd to me and also the reason I am asking."
MrRobot,fkx05ty,t1_fkwuhvm,1584613584.0,Yes. Mr Robot and the personality of his mom and the child were created because of a trauma. But the mastermind ‚Äòjust‚Äô appeared out of Elliot‚Äôs anger issues.
mentalhealth,fkqc3b6,t3_fk0zyf,1584439816.0,It is hard to learn to love yourself. Please reach out to someone that you can fully trust. This is a difficult time for you but I truly believe in you and that you can win this fight! Please hold on! I believe in you!
mentalhealth,fkqbyia,t3_fiy4ru,1584439645.0,"Get. The hell. Away. From them. As soon as possible. Your cousins are wrong about you. What they do is absolutely disgusting and you should definitely report them. They are not allowed to tell you that you are worthless. Because you are not worthless. You are worth it! Please don‚Äôt give up and hold on. I believe that you can do this. please please please don‚Äôt give up on life. You will find your way. It may take some time but it is worth it. 
I believe in you. You are stronger than you think."
