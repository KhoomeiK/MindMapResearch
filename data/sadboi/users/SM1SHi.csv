The shit finally got real, my life has never been so amazing. I can finally get laid, and my erectile disfunction has been healed. The song STATE OF HAZE has made me realise what the meaning of life truly is, I think it made me more spiritual in some ways even. THANK YOU FOR THIS LIFE CHANGING EXPERIENCE!! <3"
