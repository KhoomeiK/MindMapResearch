BPD,fq334wh,t3_ggeroa,1589062567.0,"I have to say I kind of disagree. I think my BPD does make me a lot more empathetic, whether directly or indirectly. 
I feel like I have more patience for sensitive kids because I was a ""sensitive"" kid. I think in order to control my emotions and learn to think positively, I learned a lot of skills that help me to understand how other people may think or feel. And getting better at talking about feelings even if I don't understand them.
I don't think if I had been diagnosed I would have been able to become as empathetic as I am now, and that's kind of the end goal for a lot of people. Who cares if the empathy is inherit or not? That's why we go to therapy and practice skills and just learn.
I do understand though that extremes are often unhealthy and people will go to extremes because it's natural for us. But I think some people maybe just feel proud of something that doesn't come easy."
BPD,fogr8cg,t3_g7bz7y,1587756061.0,"I am in my early 20s and I relate a lot to what you're saying, especially the job part. I think it's true that every young person has to search some for their identity, and there are lots of new things to learn. But, I do think it's different for us with BPD. After about six months at a job I start to lose my patience and feel trapped there. I know that it's a good job and I WANT to like it, but my brain just says, ""nope, time to move on"". And I think that's the difference, that there is less control.
And I don't know if medically BPD gets better with age, but learning the important coping skills definitely makes it easier.
And even though your boyfriend might not understand your situation completely, it seems like he was trying to make you feel better, but saying he doesn't believe you is NOT okay and not how a supportive partner acts."

walmart,fl2i6wo,t3_fm2dkh,1584751610.0,"There are over 700 cases in my state, the second highest number in my county. A coworker's friend just died. She was a widowed mother of six who beat cancer. The governor refuses to call for shelter in place and it's ridiculous, because the amount of people still shopping is crazy, and we are definitely not practicing social distancing in our store."
