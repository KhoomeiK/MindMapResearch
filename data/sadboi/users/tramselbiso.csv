People typically engage in multiple forms of oppression without even realising it, and much of it is considered normal. It is very rare for anyone to not oppress others. The best we can do is minimise it among those who are still alive, but those who do not exist cannot harm others and cannot be harmed themselves, so if they are not born, this reduces harm and suffering.

Imagine you have an enclosed space and many people are put in there. Then you put guns, knives and baseball bats in there. The people in there proceed to attack each other using these weapons and as people die, you add more and more people as well as more weapons. Over time the suffering rises because you have more people committing atrocities to others. There are more victims of suffering. To be successful in banning porn is like getting rid of knives. So knives are gone but because there are still guns and baseball bats and because you're filling the enclosed space with more and more people, the suffering continues to mount. So yes, you can get rid of porn, but we will have murder, rape, slaughter of animals, persecution of certain people, torture, etc. And as more and more people enter the world, the suffering increases. 

But suppose you reduce the number of weapons that go into this enclosure and you also stop putting new people in. Then over time, the number of people in this enclosure reduces and the number of victims and perpetrators of atrocity goes down. Overall suffering decreases."

These women had faith and trust in a man and their faith and trust is betrayed. For many of these women, they stay with their abuser mainly because they have children with their abuser. The abuser is usually the breadwinner and these women were fed mainstream media Hollywood propaganda where women must look for a breadwinner man and she becomes a stay at home mother and then she doesn't have to work and gets to play with the children all day. Then the reality hits that raising children is hard work, she is not paid for it at all, the man is addicted to porn and wants rough sex and thinks he deserves it because he makes the money and because he makes the money he thinks he can disrespect her including abusing her physically.

All this could be avoided if a woman simply never has children. She gets a tubal ligation and seeks to focus on her education, her job, her career, saving and investing, living frugally, and achieving financial independence so she doesn't need to rely on anyone and has personal autonomy. 

Nothing holds back women more than motherhood because motherhood requires the woman to take a break from her career, and typically childrearing responsibilities are put in women, which destroys her earnings, skills development, career trajectory. She becomes poor and financially dependent on the man, giving him power over her. With natural human and male aggression, this power difference between the man and stay at home woman is likely to lead to abuse as humans tend to exploit power difference for their own benefit.

Imagine you own a lumber mill. Trees come in, and 2x4's go out. You pay $100 for trees, $300 for running your factory, make $500 from selling 2x4's. A net profit of $100. However, a lot of the tree's mass is not capable of making 2x4s. There are oddly shaped trees, sawdust created from machining, errors that create 1x3's instead, and so on. In the past, you've always paid a garbage team $20 to haul away this industrial waste, lowering net profits to $80.

One day a paper company approaches you and offers to buy all your trashed sawdust for $30. You jump at the opportunity to grab extra cash and reduce operating expenses. Instead of a net profit of $80, profits are now $110 or more. With this money you can lower prices, expand, improve your factory, etc. Eventually your mill is producing more.

Cats are carnivores because they evolved eating animals, but whether they are obligate carnivores is up for debate, and there seems to be significant evidence that cats can live healthy lives in a vegan diet thereby refuting the idea that cats are obligate carnivores.

Freedom is a problem if it harms others. Most people consider giving humans freedom to be positive, but does that extend to the freedom to murder? What about the freedom to rape others? The same logic applies to cats or dogs. They may want to eat animals or rape other animals, but this causes harm and suffering.

DebateAVegan,fqrsj4j,t1_fqrc99o,1589590978.0,"But wouldn't there be less harm if the cat were fed vegan cat food? Even if the vegan cat food may not be perfect, it prevents other animals from being slaughtered. Let's say the vegan cat food is 50% effective. There is a 50% chance the cat will die. That is better than if you feed the cat meat and there is a 100% chance another animal dies.

Regardless, the outcomes of feeding a cat proper vegan cat food is better than 50% survival rate, so based on this simple calculation, it is better to feed cats vegan food."

DebateAVegan,fqrr5lk,t1_fqr7ixf,1589590147.0,"Something else to consider is that even if an animal is carnivorous, it doesn't mean they need to eat meet to survive. It just means that historically they ate meat to survive, but nowadays due to technology, they do not need to eat meat. For example, taurine previously could only be obtained by eating meat, but nowadays we have synthetic taurine which is higher quality than taurine from animals because laboratories allow for quality control. Synthetic taurine is found eg in Red Bull."

ASX_Bets,fqrn3la,t3_gkjys7,1589587716.0,"180k by 26 is good, so well done. Assuming you started work at 20, that means you've grown your net worth by 30k per year. Continue this until you are 40 and you will have 600k. Using the ""four percent rule"" this means at age 40 you can live off 24k per year. If you live in a country Australian town such as Bairnsdale or Minyip then you can easily live off 24k per year. To mix it up a little, go to Southeast Asia eg Bali, Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Phnom Pehn and 24k per year will give you a nice comfortable life, maybe even luxury. There are also many nice islands and beaches in Southeast Asia where you can spend the rest of your life reading books by the beach eg Koh Phangan, Koh Rong, Lombok, etc."

Another reason why tech stocks I think may outperform that have nothing to do with the pandemic is inflation. Most companies need to buy eg iron ore or have high employee costs.
