EDAnonymous,fqnh2ma,t3_gjqwwx,1589494723.0,"I am so sorry. To be honest and I’m not saying this to be hateful, but I’ve never really understood the mindset of caring about other people being fat. My eating disorder is about me and only me ya know? My hatred stops at myself. I genuinely think everyone else is beautiful and I don’t mean “beautiful in spite of being fat” I mean beautiful period. I get that these are thoughts people have and they come here to vent. But an ED is not an excuse to be fatphobic :/ I wish people thought before they spoke. Anyway I’m sorry this space is triggering for you and i wish it was different. Sending you love. <3

Edit I just want to emphasize to anyone who reads this that our EDs cause us to have awful thoughts of all kinds. They just do. We can’t control that and it sucks. But we CAN control how and if we express them and just because you have a thought doesn’t mean it needs to be shared. If you need to vent, write it in your journal or something. There’s no excuse for hurting others"

I’m not sure why I hate it so much, I think maybe it’s because I don’t like that sometimes it’s sweeter or more tart, sometimes it’s more plump and sometimes not. I don’t like the inconsistency and not knowing what it will taste/feel like before I put it in my mouth. for example I like canned peaches, because they’re always the same sweetness and texture. but I should probably try to eat more natural fruits haha"

When I met my most recent therapist, I was struggling with addiction and an eating disorder on top of anxiety and depression (which turned out to be bipolar disorder). But I was ashamed of all of it, and like others have mentioned I struggled to trust my therapist, so I spent a long time in therapy working through just “perfectionist issues.” Which to be fair, I had. And I did work through them! But there was so much more under the surface and it took me so long to talk about it. I feel like I wasted a lot of my own time."

But stopping taking meds cold turkey and without doctor supervision is *extremely* dangerous. You could get extremely ill, have a seizure, or even die. (I am sorry if you already know this, I don’t mean to be talking down to you or anything, it’s just really important and I wanted to be sure) 

Also, as to answer your actual question, the few times I have stopped taking meds didn’t work out well for me. I’ve accepted I will be taking them my whole life. But, there are definitely people who live well without them and I am by no means a “you have to take meds” person, so if you can stop safely, with doctor supervision, and it works for you, I don’t see why not."
bipolar2,fq3rvgw,t3_ggojcp,1589069465.0,"I also take lamictal and like your mom, it has affected my short-term memory (things like forgetting what i need at the grocery store or appointments if i don’t write them down right away) but to me it’s 10000% worth it because I doubt I would be alive without it. After years of alternating between suicidal depression and intense hypomania that ultimately ended in a suicide attempt and hospitalization, I started taking lamictal and reached stability. My doctor said I’m in “partial remission” and I almost cried of joy. On one hand, I don’t like that my life depends on taking meds each day, but the alternative is worse so here I am. 

I also have terrible anxiety. I take a low dose of lexapro to combat that (SSRIs can be a bad mix with bipolar but we tried it and it worked out) and I also have an rx for klonopin to take as needed for panic attacks."

TalkTherapy,fpy3t1l,t3_gg3yi4,1588995392.0,"As another commenter mentioned, the first session will be an intake and not a deep dive into anything. Your therapist will want to get to know a little bit about you and why you’ve chosen to seek therapy. I saw elsewhere you were wondering if she might refer you out — if she feels like she’s not the best fit for you (for instance maybe she’s not knowledgeable enough about asbergers) the ethical thing for her is to refer you to someone who does. It isn’t a reflection on you so don’t worry about that! 

It’s helpful to go into your first session with some goals in mind. Why are you seeking therapy? What do you want to change or accomplish? Best case scenario, when you are done with therapy, what will your life look like? My other bit of advice is to be honest with your therapist. It can be really hard to be upfront with a total stranger, but your therapist can only help you with what she knows about. 

Good on you for seeking out therapy! I hope it goes well :)"

EDAnonymous,fpqi41y,t3_gez3kp,1588823321.0,"I am not at all an expert but this kind of sounds like ARFID (avoidant restrictive food intake disorder) to me. Usually ARFID is more about a reaction to the food itself rather than a focus on calories, weight, etc. It often goes unnoticed for a long time because it can be seen as just extreme picky eating and not very many people know about it, but it can be just as dangerous as other eating disorders. 

Also, I don’t know very much about autism, but I think there is often a sensory processing component, right? Could that have anything to do with it, like the textures of the foods or something?

bipolar2,fp4mbmb,t3_gb7o7k,1588302186.0,Yeeepp. Sometimes I think about how much it sucks that I have to rely on a bunch of pills for the rest of my life. Then I remember how much it sucks more to have untreated mania/depression. Sigh
eating_disorders,fp4kykb,t3_gb2bka,1588301335.0,"It depends on her! I would just be open and honest with her, and ask her directly if that would trigger her. And if she says yes, it’s still possible that y’all can work something out (like neither of you eats in the room, or you don’t eat together, or something like that). It sounds like if y’all can avoid triggers, it would be a great roomie situation since you seem to be compassionate and understanding :)"

TalkTherapy,fp4jpgs,t3_gb5io9,1588300545.0,"She does care! It’s clear you have a connection, and it’s hard to hear someone you care about talk so darkly about themselves. And don’t feel bad about making her upset; it was a normal human reaction on her end, and I know it sounds a little cold, but you’re not responsible for her feelings. Part of her job is being able to care for herself and her emotions so she can stay present for you. It sounds like she did that :)

I hope you are feeling better and staying safe ❤️"
TalkTherapy,fp01zzm,t3_gad5z0,1588200989.0,"Yes! For me I think it’s just the nature of therapy — making myself vulnerable and speaking about things that are difficult for me. My therapist always made me feel safe, so it wasn’t specific to her."

EDAnonymous,foxat0i,t1_fovn1jr,1588138532.0,ohhhh my fucking god I thought I was the only one who had these thoughts about my name... I generally go by my full name but secretly love it when my friends call me a specific nickname because it’s somehow “cuter and skinnier” bitch what the fuck it’s a NAME
fuckeatingdisorders,fowm9yw,t3_g9v8vk,1588122581.0,"I recommend finding a dietitian that specializes in EDs or at least has experience in that area. I saw a dietitian who was utterly unhelpful because she knew nothing about anorexia and told me things like “bloating is all in your head, it’s your fear of eating.” I would like to try out an ed dietitian some day though!"

TalkTherapy,fouujnn,t1_foud0yn,1588090635.0,I hadn’t thought about choosing someone dissimilar but that makes a lot of sense! Thank you for sharing :)
AmItheAsshole,fouucyl,t3_g9m87x,1588090548.0,"NTA. She’s perfectly allowed to be such a picky eater, but she needs to learn to cook for herself or suck it up and eat what you’ve made (or pick out what she doesn’t like). 

As an aside, just from this tiny bit of info, I immediately thought of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) which is a little known eating disorder and often presents as extremely picky eating. It may be worth looking into if her eating habits are negatively affecting her."
TalkTherapy,fouapcd,t1_fou2def,1588080262.0,"This does make sense, and it is comforting, thank you :) I think maybe it’s the trial-and-error part of finding a new therapist that’s overwhelming to me. But of course there’s no way around that haha so I need to just take a deep breath and make it happen 😅"

EatingDisorders,fot98an,t3_g8xug0,1588047626.0,"I can break my binges up in those same three categories (I’d never seen it spelled out like that before)! Some of it i think is addiction — it’s a rote thing, muscle memory to keep eating once you’ve begun. 

I had to begin by identifying my feelings after — I was aware enough to stop the binge, but afterward I tried to reflect on what I was feeling. Sometimes I was completely dissociated and I have to figure out what made me dissociate (which is really hard not gonna lie). But sometimes I can identify it. For example, I often feel shame when eating around others (“am I eating too much/too little? are they judging me? they can all eat ‘normal’ and I can’t”) and i get embarrassed and ashamed. As soon as I’m alone I cope with the shame by bingeing. 

It’s complicated and, as you clearly know, a million times easier said than done. I struggle with it every day but I am seeing progress since my therapist suggested this approach as well :)"

psychologystudents,fomfdkz,t3_g88h1o,1587888005.0,"I’m kind of in the same boat! Also just graduated with an unrelated degree, would’ve taken more psych classes if I’d had time. I don’t know of any free resources like what you’re mentioning, but have you checked with your local community college to see if they offer any psych classes online? I’m taking an online course this summer, and an in-person class in the fall (if it’s safe by then), it’s a night class so I can go after work :) I’m quite excited!"

IAmA,folc1fz,t3_g7zxca,1587859036.0,"Thank you for this AMA! I see a lot of my questions have already been answered, but I’m also curious- if a client of yours (who didn’t know you have BPD) saw this AMA and put it together that it’s you, how would you handle it if they brought it up with you? 

Another question: I have a friend with BPD. I’ve been trying my best to learn about it so I can be supportive when things get bad for her. She doesn’t tend to get angry around me, but she often withdraws/isolates as a way of “they can’t leave me if I leave first” mentality. Do you have any advice for how I can best reassure her during those times?"

EDAnonymous,fohcqsc,t3_g70v1j,1587763782.0,"As I got older I switched from type A to type B. When I was a teenager I was super competitive and relentlessly hard on myself obviously not only with weight/food but also grades, athletics, my job, etc. That began to go away when I got to college, especially after I was accepted to my graduate program so my GPA mattered less. Now I’m an adult and am pretty laid-back."
