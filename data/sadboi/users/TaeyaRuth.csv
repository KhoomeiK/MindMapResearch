So I went through absolute hell!! My anti depressants couldn't be any higher so they wanted to put me on another type as well as my existing... i was suicidal and then hit 2 weeks of clarity and then back to the darkness... 

I thought i was going crazy.

I then realised that it was a cycle. Every month without a doubt... 

""But I'm not 'on my period' when it happens""... so I said fuck it and realised that at different times of your cycle, your hormones are constantly changing!! 

PMDD was the only logical issue. I want to my GP and told him (he calls me ""one of those patients that I *know* knows herself and knows what she's talking about so I trust you"" which is great!) He put me on the pill, the first month was hell! Everything got worse and then BOOM. Nothing... 

I've only had light suicidal thoughts when stress is high so all in all, the decision to try and manage my hormones was the best I've ever made!!

it's possible you're ovulating. That changes the natural scent of ones vagina.

Your natural scent will change through the month depending on where you are in your cycle.
