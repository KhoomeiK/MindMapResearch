Although it has to be very regulated. 

One in, one out sort of thing. 

Those two screws could mean a massive difference to them

I don't think it would be a shop where they are queuing down the street. 

A local family were cooking their tea, but they had too much on. A fuse blew. Their cooker circuit has gone. 

Your dad's store is a couple of hundred metres  away. 

The other one is four or five miles away. 
What should they do? 

Call an electrician who has a family, and got to think about isolation. 

Your dad's store is closed. They have to make that journey, just to get a bit of fuse wire so they can cook their tea. The streets are clear, but one turn there's a crash. The police are involved, it's bad, the fire service are involved. The first responder turns up. Then the ambulance service has to do their bit. Then the drop off to A&E. 

So yeah, your dad's little hardware shop is essential. However, he can't be complacent. Keep his distance
