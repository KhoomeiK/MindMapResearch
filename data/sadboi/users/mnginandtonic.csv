I never would have thought it was going to be me to lose their job. I always thought it would be everyone else. And here I am without work.

My grandma is immunocompromised and elderly and has stomach cancer. I don't think she can make it through this. 

I'm scared."

AskReddit,ff9r4kd,t3_esc8vq,1579719227.0,"I love these questions because it is very therapeutic for me to answer due to trauma history. \*\*TW\*\*

If I could visit 13 year old me, I would give myself all the fun things in the world. I would take myself to my favorite place (Mall of America) and I would show myself all the things I'll accomplish when I'm older-- that I just have to stick with it. We would go to the mall and I would buy myself new clothes and a ask myself what I wanted and I'd buy it. I make myself feel good by showing young me self love and compassion. We would go get my favorite food and I would tell myself how strong and beautiful I am. I would tell myself how proud I am for being so resilient and powerful. 

I would also tell myself that what was happening to me was not okay and that I can speak to my brother about it since mom wouldn't listen. I can also talk to my school counselor about it-- even if it is awkward. I would tell myself to stop hurting myself-- that I don't deserve it because I didn't do anything wrong. That I love young me and young me should love herself too. That the pain will get better and better.

I would tell myself that I should put myself first and do what I want and not what anyone else wants me to do. That I should have fun and play and laugh and enjoy. That boys ain't shit-- that you'll fall in love when you get older and it'll be better than anything you can imagine. 

Lastly, I would tell myself to set firm boundaries with everyone and if they get mad then make the boundary even bigger. Protect yourself."
TalkTherapy,ff99jm1,t1_ff90tdk,1579707954.0,"I did EMDR with a similar therapist. And because she wasn't paying attention, she didn't realize she was retraumatizing me with her lack of attention and not noticing that I was struggling with the EMDR. She actually was later arrested and in prison for something else, but looking back I'm glad I left and I wish I had known to stand up for myself. I thought I was boring or doing something wrong or wasn't important enough for her to pay attention so I just let it happen. 

Might be worth getting a second opinion, at least I think so."
