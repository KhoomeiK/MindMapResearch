In the menu for dead keys, you choose a base character (in my case, vowel) and a composite character (in my case, some cyrilic character).

For example: Character for /ko/ is ""!"", so turn ""k"" into a dead key. Base charcter would be ""o"", and composite character would be ""!"". So now, ""k"" alone won't actually type anything, untill you press ""k"" and ""o"" right after each other - then it will type ""!"". If you have a font (like I did), you can create a special character and asign it to ""!"".

Hopefully, you understood my broken english lol"
