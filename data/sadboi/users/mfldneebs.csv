DeadBedrooms,fntfqdb,t1_fntbm9y,1587240740.0,It's so frustrating as he's my best friend and the one person I can rely on and yet a massive part of our relationship has been taken away and I don't know how to get it back.
DeadBedrooms,fntexq4,t1_fntb0vk,1587240288.0,"You're right, I've been ignoring it hoping it'll improve naturally, but the current situation has made me realize it'll never change. Planning to have another big chat with him, outlining everything and see what happens."
DeadBedrooms,fnszw5y,t1_fnsz2c3,1587231959.0,It's so easy to overlook the issue when they make up for it in so many other ways. However I'm finally realizing it's something I need in a relationship so hope we can fix it!
DeadBedrooms,fnsy00z,t1_fnswght,1587230942.0,Very true. Guess I just got used to it after all this time and need a realty check.
DeadBedrooms,fnsxrfo,t1_fnsvyok,1587230811.0,There could easily be something deeper going on but his pride is stopping him from opening up to me. I'll discuss therapy and see if he would be willing to at least try it.
SkincareAddicts,fnbh1fu,t3_g0r4yj,1586815394.0,It's the only thing to clear up my cystic acne. My skin was dry and flaky to start so I only used it 3 nights a week until my tolerance built up. Now I use it most nights with no issue. Try pairing it with a niacinamide serum and use a hydrating moisturizer afterwards.

Anxiety,flscvk7,t3_fq8z5a,1585439319.0,I've been struggling with e-correspondence for years now and finally decided to look into it tonight and found your post straight away! I've had to put my phone on do not disturb after receiving a group message and feeling my heart sink with dread and knowing loads of replies would start flooding in. It wasnt a bad message at all but I just cant deal with it. I'll definitely spend some time reading about avoidance anxiety now and I'm so glad to know I'm not the only one with this aversion!
AmItheAsshole,fjck6cz,t3_fclhar,1583223544.0,"YTA for what you did to your daughter and her friend,  but also because you're not listening to commenters explain how your behaviour will have negative long term effects on your relationship with her. She's at an important stage in her life where she needs more freedom. If you take that all away, you will lose her.

Talk to your daughter like an adult, not a toddler."

bridezillas,fdxxwp4,t1_fdwo7uw,1578774029.0,UK! Events took place in lovely Liverpool.
bridezillas,fdv46y1,t3_en5nvw,1578743014.0,"This was about 5 years ago and not so much a bridezilla story. The bride to be was my cousin and we've never been close and I didnt know anyone else there, so I felt lonely most of the night. We took a limo to a nearby city and were meant to all go back to my cousins after. The other people were on a mission to get drunk as quickly as possible which wasn't an issue until everyone started fighting with each other over nothing. The MOH smashed a load of glasses and bottles in one bar for no reason and spent the rest of the night screaming at my cousin. Another girl punched her friend in the face and then disappeared, ultimately missing the limo home. While waiting around in the limo for the missing girl, a group of guys were checking it out and started trying to smash it up because we wouldnt let them inside, hitting a couple of the girls in the process. I was able to get dropped off at home instead of sleep at my cousin's and it was the best feeling getting away from it all. The wedding went ahead with no more issues but they ended up getting divorced. I'm dreading the thought of her getting remarried and going through it again!"

relationships,f9kil7h,t3_e5lflf,1575401205.0,"I was in a toxic relationship and ended up blocking him to finally break free. That was 9 years ago and your post has just reminded me that he's been blocked this entire time.

Put yourself first and do what is best for your mental health moving forward and if that means keeping him blocked forever, there's nothing wrong with that."
