I have two young children at home so I can‚Äôt be on those all the time. 
I stay home with the kids while my husband still goes to work almost everyday working with the public. I stress everyday that he‚Äôll bring it home. We‚Äôve been quarantined since 3/12 and I‚Äôm just tired. So tired and overwhelmed. I cry daily (alone so my kids don‚Äôt get scared). I lost my mom at a young age and I can‚Äôt bear the thought of dying and leaving my kids. My son also has asthma and I worry about him. 
I turned off all news alerts on my phone and I‚Äôm limiting my social media time. When it‚Äôs nice I go to the backyard and soak up some sun. I bought an exercise bike to use at home (I‚Äôve been stress eating BAD).
