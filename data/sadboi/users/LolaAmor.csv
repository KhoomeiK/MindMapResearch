Anxiety,fm32uzk,t3_fsnao9,1585711467.0,"This whole post and all the comments make me feel less alone. I’ve been struggling so bad lately. Anxiety attacks come every so often, causing tightness in my chest and shortness of breath. I have an rx for hydroxyzine but it makes me feel high and pretty out of it. I have two young children at home so I can’t be on those all the time. 
I stay home with the kids while my husband still goes to work almost everyday working with the public. I stress everyday that he’ll bring it home. We’ve been quarantined since 3/12 and I’m just tired. So tired and overwhelmed. I cry daily (alone so my kids don’t get scared). I lost my mom at a young age and I can’t bear the thought of dying and leaving my kids. My son also has asthma and I worry about him. 
I turned off all news alerts on my phone and I’m limiting my social media time. When it’s nice I go to the backyard and soak up some sun. I bought an exercise bike to use at home (I’ve been stress eating BAD). 
I don’t know what to do and I feel so alone. This post helped a bit. Thank you and I hope you all know you’re not alone."

I only wish the chapters were a bit longer. Though I am willing to overlook that due to earning more gems.
