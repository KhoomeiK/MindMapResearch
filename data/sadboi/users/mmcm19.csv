EatingDisorders,fm40ara,t3_fsmm1j,1585743012.0,"I fully understand how exhausting this feels. Most days i get this too and a way I’ve learned to prevent this from happening is setting a boundary and telling them straightforward how it makes me feel. I don’t go into any detail or say much about it but something like ‘talking about food can be a very triggering topic for some people, it’s not funny to joke about, so i appreciate if we leave this conversation here :)’ could be helpful. I figured out taking a more kind route (as much as you have every right to go off on them) makes them more likely to understand how sincere you are about not talking about it. I guess that could depend on how close you are with your co workers but i really hope this helps and i wish you the best!"
