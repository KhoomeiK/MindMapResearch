BPD,etgacji,t3_bzequr,1562786891.0,"Thank you for this. Truly. 

I beat myself up for actually having heard ""that's just your BPD talking"" from an abusive partner and think/feeling that it ""should"" have ""woken me up"" (even if the abuse didn't)... but I stayed and stayed. And it haunts me and that mean part of me still says it was my fault."
Anxiety,etg91e0,t3_cbfysz,1562786145.0,"Took my 6yo to summer day camp today for the first time. Terrified me to do so.

Background: She is my nonbio daughter and while she is absolutely the most important thing in my life... I have been in heart pounding ""I can't do this I am a horrible parent/person"" debilitating anxiety nonstop for the past month.

Still having those thoughts (along with racking guilt for ""pawning off my kid"") but at least I get to have them in a quiet space where I can use my CBT skillz to get my brain in order.

And play with Legos alone."
Anxiety,etg7ttf,t3_cbbbqw,1562785465.0,"Slightly unrelated: When I was a kid I remember a David Letterman Top 10 List: NYC April Fool's Jokes: 

""Suicide helplines play Van Halen's 'Jump'""

As a middle schooler I thought it was hilarious. As an adult who has called crisis lines it makes me a bit sick. 

And I'm really sorry you had to experience a dangerous and hurtful form of that bad joke. <3"
