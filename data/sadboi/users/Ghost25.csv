This study, published in The Journal of Political Economy analyzed the real housing market in New York and attempted to quantify the effects from rent control policy there. Some of the key quotes in my opinion:

* ""Therefore, among the set of families who receive a net benefit from rent control, poorer families receive larger benefits. Furthermore, such families are overrepresented in controlled housing. In these senses, rent control achieves some of the objectives desired by supporters of the program. However, the extremely low coefficients of determination in (20) and (2 1) suggest a great variance in the distribution of benefits among recipient
families who are identical in these five characteristics. There is nothing approaching equal treatment of equals among the beneficiaries of rent control. In this sense, rent control is a very poorly focused redistribution device.""

* ""Phelps-Brown and Wiseman (1964, pp. 225-26) point out, rent controlcreates incentives for people to continue to occupy their controlled apartments even though their places of work change and to reject otherwise preferable jobs far from their present locations""

* ""Since the landlord's revenue from his rent-controlled apartment is independent of its condition, landlords will not invest in maintenance. Hence, rent-controlled housing will deteriorate faster than it would in the absence of rent control. ... the cost of producing a unit of housing service in a controlled apartment will be higher than the cost of producing a unit in the uncontrolled market""

* ""In other housing markets where rent control was terminated fifteen to twenty years earlier, it is doubtful that landlords attach a very high probability to the imposition of rent control. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that investors in rental housing in New York City will demand and receive a higher-risk premium.""

I think psychedelics would really only make sense in the scenario where you're trying to work through a traumatic event for example the loss of a loved one or dealing with a terminal illness. Even then you have to be careful because the psychedelic experience is very sensitive to set and setting as well as dose."

BipolarReddit,f65qm58,t3_dqhwzs,1572704407.0,Have you talked to your psychiatrist about your hypersexuality? Low-dose antipsychotics with D2 activity may reduce hypersexuality without all the negative side effects commonly associated with normal dosing of antipsychotics.
AskDrugNerds,f4yi767,t1_f4wxxgd,1571877056.0,"There are some dopamine agonists that are off-label for treatment-resistant depression. Probably the most common one is pramipexole which is generally used to treat restless leg syndrome. You could ask your psychiatrist about prescribing it for depression or you could probably lie to your primary care doctor and say that you have all the symptoms of restless leg syndrome. I always recommend being honest with your doctor but it's up to you. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15549689/

It's just not clear based on your post if depression is really your problem."

AskDrugNerds,f4lqjkb,t1_f4lpq22,1571670239.0,"Lamictal shouldn't be a big deal, I'm not very familiar with trintillex but I know some people who take LSD with other SSRIs without issue. I think the abilify could kill the trip though. Again it's really not recommended but if I had to bet I would say you probably have significantly weaker effects then normal because of the antipsychotics. But I don't necessarily think that serotonin syndrome is very likely."

AskDrugNerds,f4lmy8r,t3_dks0fz,1571669063.0,"It depends on the neurotransmitter sometimes it's reuptake and sometimes it's degraded. Monoamine oxidase for example can degrade dopamine, acetylcholinesterase can degrade acetylcholine but that doesn't mean that they cannot be taken back up. Serotonin is often and taken back into the presynaptic cell by endocytosis. SSRIs for example can inhibit this reuptake."
AskDrugNerds,f4lmnwp,t3_dkly12,1571668954.0,I wouldn't bother with extraction unless you're willing to take a pretty good chance that you destroy all your product. Psilocybin is fairly sensitive to degradation when exposed to swings in pH and oxidation. Mushrooms will stay potent for years if dried well and stored in a sealed mason jar.
AskDrugNerds,f4lkv4a,t1_f4laezh,1571668333.0,"Haha, you're right. I thought it was 4-6. Yes I suspect it has to do with GABA receptor regulation. With heavy abuse of benzodiazepines gaba receptors likely become highly desensitized and endogenous levels are insufficient to maintain good neural functioning and tone.

if I had to guess why this is not as true for alcohol it would be because the affinity of alcohol for the GABA receptor is much more weak than GABA agonists like benzodiazepines."

changemyview,f3bkmtc,t3_dg8ozy,1570812323.0,"I fundamentally agree with you. But for the sake of playing devil's advocate I will argue against you. Is dysphoria or suffering in and of itself desirable? Of course not. But suffering and hardship is often a catalyst for personal growth. 

Nobody wants to be born poor and hungry, nobody wants to be born disabled, or be orphaned but the reality is that many people are. For many people these are defining experiences in their life and they shape how they see the world and other people. People who grow up poor and are forced to work to provide for their family may feel that they have learned valuable lessons such as the value of hard work or the importance of close knit family. If you never had to struggle for food, money, or anything else it doesn't necessarily mean that you can't learn valuable lessons but sometimes life lessons are more impactful when they're experienced first-hand. for many people these lessons can be defining experiences in their life.

Being trans is a significant hardship, they face internal distress from their psychological State and external stress in the form of bullying, discrimination etc. These kinds of stresses can show an individual people's true motives and how they act when they're faced with something that makes them uncomfortable. 

Trans people may find a tight-knit community that they identify with and they may make lifetime friends or relationships through that community.

I don't disagree that their life would be less stressful if they didn't have any dysphoria, but for some people the dysphoria or being trans forces them to see the world in a way that they ultimately come to appreciate.

it's possible that people who experience this feel that if they never underwent any hardships they would be a worse person for it, either because they never learned certain life lessons, they never met certain people, or they never found out how strong their friendships or family relations truly are."
BipolarReddit,f3bgqm5,t3_dg9yfq,1570809881.0,"I am not a doctor nor have I ever experienced erotomania. But I am a molecular biologist and I'm interested in bipolar disorder. I think the key is going to be finding the right antipsychotic. Many antipsychotics are dopamine antagonists meaning they reduce the effect of dopamine in the brain. High levels of dopamine can trigger mania and inappropriate reward responses like sexual arousal. There are several different dopamine receptors in the brain that play different roles in terms of behavior. I think in the case of erotomania D1, D2, and D4 are the most relevant. Although others may play some role. 

Some 1st Gen antipsychotics that may be of interest (these may have more side effects):

Chlorpromazine

Haloperidol

Spiperone

Some second generation antipsychotics (these may have less side effects):

Amisulpride

Asenapine

Quetiapine

Risperidone"
