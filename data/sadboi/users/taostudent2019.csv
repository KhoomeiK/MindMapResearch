It was a dysfunctional snowball effect.  My Father, who I love, would man handle the oldest, who would hit, the next brother.  By the time it got to me, it was two beatings a day.  I never laid a hand on my little brother.

So that was a base line 2 beatings a day, at home in grammar school.  My lovely brothers were spreading the love in school too.  

When I got to high school.  They were waiting for me.  So twice a day, multiple upperclassmen were coming after me.   So twice a day, there were at least two full sized kids coming after me, the second smallest kid in the school.

I would have to dodge their punches, throw enough to stop them so I could use the other bathroom and run for it.  And that was everyday.

I do not like McDonald's hamburgers, therefore I hate all hamburgers.

Several Taoist schools have gone public after thousands of years of training in hiding.  They were hunted and killed off as seen as anti-establishment and anti-government.  Which they were not.  But perception rules.

Then the Masters gave the command to the teacher's aids to start practicing certain demonstrations.

Windows were covered and special teams were created.  Retreats were set up.  And about a decade, maybe two of training began, of these different forms of Kung Fu designed for demonstrations.

Just because this is happening, does not mean the original forms are not still being practiced in secret.  I'm guessing those public demonstrations make up 10% of the training.

They have a different deal, because they are a monastery.  It's a full life devotion.

But you don't just spend several years learning how to be fully clandestine and then give it up and turn your whole program into an open book.

We put ourselves out there as completely an open book.   But we are still 95% of our training and work is done in secret.  Secret meetings, training, no uniforms.

For example,  I have years of specialized training and meditation for activities where I am wearing a business suit.
