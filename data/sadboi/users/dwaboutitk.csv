You’re way too young to be thinking about measuring up to your parents success. They probably don’t even give a fuck and just want you to be happy with your life. That’s all that should matter. If that is the one thing making you think about killing yourself, you should be fine. In the next 1 and a half years or hopefully even by this one message you should realize that trying to measure up to other people’s success is just unhealthy and you will find something that genuinely makes you feel happy. It may take a while, but do it for yourself. Explore your hobbies further. Fuck whatever your parents did/have done. Do what makes you happy. That should make them happy as well. I’m sure if they knew about the thoughts that you are having right now, they would be heartbroken and just want for you what makes you happy. Please realize that trying to measure what your future success will be like compared to your parents, or anyone, will lead to depression, and what you are experiencing right now. Also, you have so much fucking time in the next year and a half to realize this. So many new people will enter your life and hopefully help you realize that the thoughts you’re having right now shouldn’t mean shit in the future, as long as YOU are happy."

What I do know is that the people in your life that you think won’t give a shit, definitely do. I can promise you that. That is the one thing keeping me from killing myself. If you can’t do it for yourself, do it for your friends and family. Think of it like this, I know you hate your life and everything about it, but do you love the people around you? Even just a little bit? If so then know that it will absolutely tear them apart and ruin them. You don’t want to do that to the people you love do you? I’m here to talk if you need/want to. Would also help me out a bit probably to talk to someone going through the same shit and thoughts that I am."

SuicideWatch,flly6ay,t3_fic73e,1585270261.0,In the exact same spot. It fucking sucks. I hate it so much but know it’ll tear other people apart.
