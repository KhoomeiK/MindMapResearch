That's why they call it the American Dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.  -George Carlin

Also:  

You are correct about the advertising and how it always convinces us that ""we need more.""  Right now, I am on an EXTREMELY tight budget, like eating for a full week off 20 dollars US absolute MAX kind of budget-(yes, it is just me). ---and I need to continue to do it gluten free and reasonably healthfully.  This has proven to be surprisingly doable the longer I have to do it.   Doing it correctly means walking into a grocery store with a recipe, getting a basket or small cart, and walking out with the items you have on your list and nothing else.   Even sales mess with your head because you think ""Man, I'd better get that on sale so I can save money on it.  I'm gonna need it eventually.""  But no- you really need to think of what you NEED rather than what's on sale, then select the cheapest PER OUNCE or POUND  cost of what you need- not the cheapest package.  Bonus points if what you NEED is on sale, which could contribute to it being the cheapest cost per pound or ounce, and that is what you are looking for.  It requires literally walking in a quick beeline to what you need, then ruthlessly inspecting the price per ounce / pound etc.  This is literally the opposite of what the store seems to have programmed me and and everyone else to do, which is spend a hell of a lot more time looking at everything else that I might need, or might need in the future, and a lot less time making a decision on the cheapest cost per pound item I can buy.  It really has changed everything for me and makes it something I can continue to do when I get out this financial hole- and I imagine if I can continue these behaviors when I make more money, it will allow me to save money.

essentialoils,f0ampue,t1_f092c0h,1568516479.0,"Thank you so much for posting this.  I work in schools and this whole thing with the diffusers going all the time is INSANE.   Teachers are trying to ""calm the kids down"" with diffusers, which is, by definition, trying to ""gas"" the kids!  I wonder how many parents are aware of this diffuser thing, and how many teachers and administrators are so brainwashed by the MLM oil companies (which is the provider most of the oil diffusers I see) that they think they're actually doing something healthy for the kids?"
zoloft,f0ajqtc,t3_d4ejov,1568515552.0,Didn't happen from Zoloft but my sister told me that was happening to her- she got a blood test and is low on Vitamin D.  She's taking a supplement now and that stopped happening.
BuyItForLife,f0adhd3,t3_d477yv,1568513446.0,"Do not get any kind of ""comfort fit"" or ""stretch"" jeans.  The materials that make the jeans stretchy -spandex like stuff- also make the jeans weaker.  It's coming into men's jeans now, so watch out for it."
zoloft,f0ab2f2,t3_d43q1x,1568512663.0,"I drink coffee with no problems, though I am drinking less of it as I don't need it to simply move during the day."
CPTSD,f0a5psf,t3_d48pxo,1568510921.0,"Yes.  I was always amazed by how my friends could pick anyone up at a bar.  I could only hear the band and had to shout ""what"" so many times that I just stopped trying and kept pounding drinks.  Also, when smoking became banned in most bars, also led me to want to continue smoking just to stand outside where the noise wasn't so loud so I could talk to people.    This coupled with social anxiety, etc lead to the perfect breeding ground for a drinking problem.  (Haven't touched a drink in 3 years, which was the second try, and quit smoking five years ago.)."

zoloft,f09v9ch,t3_d4bzwo,1568507391.0,It is a black box warning for SSRI's.  There is a known risk of suicidal ideation in young adults with Zoloft.  Go to the emergency room ASAP- and please know it is only the drug.

Thanks for reminding me of something else I need to do at this time. Glad you get to enjoy making something your mom enjoyed making."
zoloft,f02th2r,t3_d3cctd,1568337861.0,"One question, was Zoloft the only thing you were on that could have caused a panic attack?   The reason I say this is that if you were depressed for a long time and drinking a lot of caffeine to function or something like that, the Zoloft could have contributed to an overload of it in your system as well.  I know I drink less coffee now (I still drink it, I love it) but I can't even think of having the amount I was drinking just to function when I was depressed."
zoloft,f00b2n7,t3_d37uef,1568299586.0,"Yes- eat the cost and keep those pills as backup.  I have been in that situation, not for the same reason but because of moving to a new area with new job and new insurance- looking for a new doctor and running out in the meantime.  If you can figure out what is going on with how long it will take for those pills to show up, then you can get a temporary supply from the pharmacy.    But you already have the pills there, so you can pick them up.   Do not mess with withdrawals."

Unfortunately, when you see something that says ""no experience necessary"" in a field like marketing, so competitive that you need a good internship to get a competitive internship in order to even be considered for a job,  it's a serious red flag."

NewsOfTheStupid,ezrxx9y,t3_d1vyps,1568080295.0,"Well, there are shrimp thieves.  I remember the first time I saw in the paper ""40 lbs of shrimp stolen.""  I was like ""what the hell is going on?""  Turns out meth heads will steal the shrimp and sell it to Chinese restaurants for money.  I haven't got a shrimp dish from a Chinese place since, as I don't know how long the shrimp might have been sitting in the back of some meth head's car.  Now in certain places in Philly, the shrimp bags have the same security tags that have to be removed by the cashier-that you see on electronic equipment.  It's really messed up.

When you start feeling better, it might be easy to skip a therapy session because you're ""feeling OK"", but sticking with it even when you are doing well is really important.  (It's like continuing to finish the bottle of the antibiotics even when you feel better.)"

Anxiety,ey44r8q,t3_cvdgpw,1566781781.0,"It actually makes sense that the last thing you'd want to do is ""sensory deprive"" yourself in any way in public, especially in a major city- which would warrant ""noise cancelling"" headphones.  Of course, I have anxiety and PTSD among other things, so this only makes sense to me."

DrugNerds,ey3axod,t1_ey2xpkb,1566759817.0,Nice-so they really don't know an addictive potential of a drug when it is released to the population-as those with addictive tendencies are excluded from the trials.  Interesting.

It's hard when it's not an obvious specific ""trigger warning,"" but those of us who know what you mean about ""a certain mental state"" thank you kindly.  I remember a few months ago when I thought ""Oh I'll just come home from work and throw on a movie"" on a Friday night.  That movie was Annihilation.  It messed with me for weeks, and really, is still messing with me to some degree.  I didn't finish watching it it was messing with me so bad.  Thanks again, and also take my recommendation about Annihilation if you haven't seen it yet.  Midsommar is duly noted as well."
zoloft,exyoxd5,t1_exyd0e0,1566654908.0,"Here in US and no warning has been on my bottles, but I did some googling and found that it can cause increased drowsiness and dizziness.  It's a pretty weak reaction compared to some of the other drugs that can cause fatal reactions with it, but it's good to know.
