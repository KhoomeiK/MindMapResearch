Twitch,ffwvifp,t1_ffwsb4t,1580311968.0,"Depends on what you play. I would only start with your best clips or tutorial videos. A lot of gaming youtubers tend to focus on one game. Variety gamers have a bit of a tougher time as it's personality driven more than the game.

tutorials are good cause they usually always get traffic, just make sure to plug your twitch in the video."
Twitch,ffws0lo,t1_ffwnunx,1580309616.0,It depends on how much effort you put into it. A lot of streamers I watch dont do much YouTube and stick to twitch while others get a lot. It's basically down to time management and which platforms you want to focus on.

Twitch,ffvio7b,t1_ffvf0mt,1580265021.0,"Hi, zero for years here lol. But what i can tell you is the above poster is correct. Imo personality is key. We all have bad days but when your constantly being salty about a game or not enjoying it, viewers will pick up on that.

While game does matter viewers mostly get interested and involved with streamers so even if the game is bad, as long as your enjoying it and doing your best viewers will stay. Not all of them but it's important to have regulars. As far as a example I streamed magic the gathering for a year with no success. While the game is popular irl it did'nt translate to viewers as shown by the huge gaps in viewership going from 2k to 1k to 300 then 50 or less. I changed to teamfight tactics and I did get a small bump in viewers but more importantly I was actually enjoying the game."
Twitch,ffvi4v4,t3_eo3b8l,1580264658.0,"Hi, all i've been streaming for almost since twitch was born and while I've had minor success then, after a medical break I was not able to recover my viewership. My only goal is to hit affiliate and provide a chat room for people to hang out in and enjoy at the moment. I just made a schedule today so hopefully that helps in the future. I streamed magic the gathering all last year with no success and have recently switched to teamfight tactics and it's going a little bit better.

Twitch,ffvgm2m,t1_fejls39,1580263645.0,"Your clip the top overlay doesn't really seem necessary as it just says what your streaming which viewers already know what game it is. I would either add followers to it or make a different overlay with different goals or follower counts.

It seems like you got a lot of social media so might want to look into making a discord where viewers can also interact offline also. It's a bit more complicated and personal than twitter but having a free chat room for the channel helps you notify your regulars who might not have their email notifications on."

Ty for the response."
Twitch,ffue8e1,t3_ev9ycx,1580240111.0,Webcam is very important. Very few streamers are successful without it. I would look into using one because viewers like to see reactions to things.
Twitch,ffu8624,t1_ffu4um8,1580236515.0,"All your points I agree with and even already practice.

I am missing a schedule and as far as being active in communities I find it hard to actually find one.

As far as the games. I streamed magic the gathering all of last year. But until recently i realized the viewer gap is huge going from 2k to 1k to 300. It's not even saturated at all but the viewership was so low considering how popular the game is irl. I switched to teamfight tactics. It's a bit more saturated but I actually was able to get viewers.

Quality content I think might be my biggest issue but i'll probably have to post in the feedback thread to find out what's wrong.

I just got a tip within the last 30mins to up my social media game instead of posting links. Combined with what you just posted makes sense.

Once again ty for the response."
Twitch,ffu7dq5,t1_fe830hf,1580236046.0,"A lot of people here said what I was thinking but i'll do my best ot give feedback. 

Face cam: As a variety streamer I feel like a face cam is even more important as viewers are more into the personality more than the game since the games will be switched up. Compared to playing let's say league of legends were people would maybe enjoy the skill more.

Layout: The art you use is a bit odd. The lettering size kind of throws me off and some of it is to tiny. I would re work it if possible."
Twitch,ffu3c72,t1_fffvgov,1580233595.0,"Seem's fine for the most part. I would suggest posting a clip of a good moment to make it easier to review but from what I see on your channel there's a couple of things that might benefit you.

Social media: I don't see any links in your bio page. I would suggest making some social media accounts so people can follow you elsewhere and you can promote. The simplest one imo is twitter due to hashtags. Also some people get really involved in the streamers life so having other avenues for fans to connect is always good.

Face cam: There's not that many successful streamers that don't use a camera. While it is possible, viewers do like to see who their watching and live reactions. also helps if you switch games cause if someone dosen't enjoy the game they probably won't stay if there's nothing to look at."

I started with a social anxiety meetup group. I was confused when I found out it existed but I went only cause I assumed people would have similar problems.

I only went a few times but I was able to talk to people without being judged. From there I slowly got out of the house more and began talking to certain people. Through those people I eventually met other people and my social skills got a lot better.
