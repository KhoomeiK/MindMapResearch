reactivedogs,fl7kgz0,t3_fn0bzq,1584903601.0,"My pup does this too. She whines and pulls to go up to another dog and I think the tension on the leash adds to her frustration. She wants to say hi but she gets overstimulated and nips or growls. She’s not aggressive at all, she likes other dogs, but it does look and sound scary. Not to mention they can sense your anxiety which makes it worse. So I don’t let her approach other dogs because I don’t want to risk a scuffle. But in a controlled area or with someone you know, leashed greetings can work if you keep slack on the leash and circle with the dog as they sniff butts. And then use a leave it or call them away with a treat or toy to break that hyper fixation for a bit."
Advice,fkzwhg6,t3_fllwwc,1584682567.0,"It’s funny that you mention this. I was just looking through old photos. I used to be so proud of who I was. I loved who i was. And the nostalgia kicks just remind me that that person is gone. I’m in a pretty bad place now, so the contrast really makes it feel worse. But we’re constantly changing, we never stay the same. I used to always try to be that person from the past again but it’s useless. It’s not like we peaked and it’s just downhill from here. We will continue to experience new things and grow."

ElPaso,fjab0sa,t3_fahhqv,1583169912.0,"Ok so his name is Luis Cuevas, his daughter Cecilia has cancer. His grandson Julian helps him do landscaping. Apparently a lot of people have accused him of being a scammer, so he’s kinda hesitant about drawing attention with fundraisers and prefers small donations or work (I think clothes as well). Tbh i wasn’t sure if he was legit or not at first either. Anyway fell free to pm me if you’d like his contact info for work!"
ElPaso,fja98ac,t3_fahhqv,1583168956.0,Hi! He’s not a scammer. My neighborhood community know him well and he is struggling. He does modest work for people around here to make ends meet and to help his daughter who does indeed have cancer. He does yard work and such. He’s a very genuine and kind man. Lemme see if I can get the info ~
bipolar,fit562i,t3_f9ossv,1582704921.0,YES. I get heated when someone disagrees with me on something. I pick fights with people when they state something and i want to tell them they’re wrong. I kinda have an “I’m right about everything” attitude. I know it’s bad but it’s hard to suppress.
BipolarReddit,fi9zeas,t3_f7045z,1582288479.0,"Wow very proud of you! You sound a lot like me. I’m sticking it out this semester too! It’s so hard to get up and go, and to accept less than stellar grades. But you made it a whole month! Best of luck on the rest of the semester, friend!"
reactivedogs,fi45bbg,t3_f64ldc,1582134271.0,"Totally agree. Unfortunately non dog people will never cohesively learn to understand it.

Dogtraining,ff1zrz9,t3_er16ft,1579490021.0,I’m trying to curb my dog from doing this too. I will only give her attention when she is on all fours. When she starts tapping and pawing at me I get up and leave and ignore her til she’s on all fours again. I tell others to do the same. We haven’t done it long enough to see much progress but my fingers are crossed!
Petloss,fecihg3,t3_eof0rq,1578974721.0,"I’m so sorry you’re going through this. But please don’t feel guilty. I felt so guilty for having my baby girl put down when she had pancreatitis. The vet said it would be best to put her down, but she still seemed like she could have pulled through. She was struggling, but I felt like I should have tried harder before having to let her go. But trust me. Your vet would not have let you put your baby to sleep unless they believed it was the right way to go. You are not a traitor. You loved your babies and you did right by them. They left the world feeling your love. I wish you the best."

Being around my family, they treat me like I’m crazy, and as hard as I try to get them to understand, they just don’t. I’m feeling pretty shitty tonight too. I’m just trying to imagine myself coming out of this low mood soon. I always do, eventually. And imagining having tamales for Christmas. And even further into the future, getting to do whatever I want and making my own family who will love me for who I am, and traveling and having dogs cause it’s my life and I will get control of it again. You will too. Eres mas fuerte de lo que to crees."

dogs,fad9qp1,t3_e8fc5y,1575960842.0,"I hurt for you. And I’m so sorry you’re going through this. I too loved my dog so much that it ached. I’ve never loved anyone as much as I loved her and I don’t think I ever will again. It’s hard to explain to others, especially those who aren’t dog people. I would just say to really let yourself feel it. The raw and crippling grief will subside eventually, but until then, allow yourself to really feel it. For me, the pain was so excruciating that my mind forced every memory of her existence into the back of my head. As a defense mechanism i guess. Locked it away so I could function. If I thought of her too much, I’d go right back to being bedridden, not wanting to have anything to do with life anymore. I should have embraced it and talked about it. I still can’t say her name and it’s almost been 2 years."

BipolarReddit,f8f5qlt,t1_f8evt24,1574538683.0,I always hear about it but I haven’t done it. My therapist mentioned wanting to start EDMR therapy for some unrelated stuff. I’ll mention DBT as well. I’m glad it helped you.
BipolarReddit,f8f5bxi,t1_f8e59gu,1574538469.0,"I read the description for that and I was like HOLY FUCK THATS ME. But I don’t have ADHD. It does feel good to see what you go through put in someone else’s words so concisely though, I feel less crazy. 

Yeah that’s how I feel. Like I NEED to have someone. I had partners back to back for a long time when I was younger. Thank you so much. I definitely need work in the self love department. I like that saying. Coincidentally I kill all my plants irl haha. Thanks again."
BipolarReddit,f8f3je2,t1_f8ey67d,1574537852.0,I really doubted the bipolar diagnosis until I removed people from the equation and I thought it began to make sense to me. But I’ve also been diagnosed with ADHD and then told by another doc that I don’t have it. I’m still figuring it out I guess.
BipolarReddit,f8f2sc9,t1_f8eh5zt,1574537570.0,"I know what you mean. When I was younger and I didn’t understand what was happening to me, a diagnosis helped make sense of it all. But I think I have a bad habit of handing the reins over entirely to my healthcare professionals rather than voicing what I think might be going on too. In the year that I’ve been with my current therapist, I’ve completely isolated myself until this incident so this will be the first time we deal with my difficulty with relationships. I am afraid to open that can of worms but also looking forward to finally acknowledging it. 

Thank you very much for your kind words. I hope you know how helpful it is. It’s usually hard to give myself credit for anything really."
BipolarReddit,f8ecz1y,t1_f8e2428,1574525098.0,I have not. I will bring it up at our next appointment. Although I feel like I’ll be letting her down because i had been doing so well. Really? Do you think I may have been misdiagnosed?
BipolarReddit,f80w11f,t3_dyfkg1,1574140041.0,Yeah none of my old hobbies really bring me joy anymore. I used to draw and write and listen to music and get really into movies but I just don’t really care about any of it anymore. I do however have an unfaltering love for animals and I sometimes foster puppies for the local humane society. I am pretty much forced to get up early and care for them which helps put me on a schedule. It feels good to help them too.
dogs,f7qjoyz,t1_f7q1bz4,1573964927.0,"Ugh this feeling destroys me. When I updated my rescue’s microchip info online, it had her previous owners’ info including her old name. I called her by her old name and she became frantic, looking around everywhere, tail wagging. It broke my heart. I’ve had her for almost 2 years now. She’s 8 years old. She was with her original family from puppyhood til she was 6. She has horrible separation anxiety and acts very depressed and isn’t really affectionate with me. I recently found her original family by pure coincidence when I was looking through lost and found fb pages. They were looking for her new family and wanted to see her and maybe take her back. They posted photos of her with all these other dogs and kids and she looks so happy in them. I haven’t responded and I don’t know what to do about it and it sucks."
dogs,f6l2ol6,t1_f6jp4e4,1572927201.0,"I have not really brought it up with my therapist. She’s great, but I’m afraid she’ll downplay the death of a dog. I’ve had that reaction before from mental health professionals that don’t really understand that it hurts as much as losing a human family member. I could try. 

It feels good to know I’m not alone in feeling this. Thank you for sharing. Maybe I should have waited longer to have a new dog, but the empty house was driving me nuts. I’m glad i adopted her, i love her very much, but I’m constantly doubting myself. It’s crazy how their precious little lives are entirely in our hands. 

I hope our dogs live very long and happy lives."
