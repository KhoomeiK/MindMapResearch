I tried the entire warranty cycle to get a replacement and they dragged it out saying they were going to honour it but wanted to gather more information internally first. In the last few weeks, they tell me they are going to fully replace it but drag out sending it until my warranty expired. Then they tell me something like basically ""Sorry, but your warranty has expired the best I can do is offer you 15% off a new mic."" 

I had still bought 4 mics from them despite this since the audio quality was solid and they didn't pick up BG noise. The replacements were measurably worse in audio quality. I disassembled them and found that they've swapped the $2 ECM Electret Mic Module for a 40 cent one in the new versions. They make like $60+ profit.

OverwatchUniversity,fp1wicl,t1_fp0qvpw,1588249744.0,"I would say auto-pilot is a big thing, but don't overthink it. It's not something that simply acknowledging can correct. It's more likely to psyche you out thinking that you aren't focused because you're on Auto-pilot, which is a normal brain function.

I'd suggest playing key heroes again to get a better feel for when things happen. 

Obviously preaching to the choir, but:  
*An Example*: Playing a lot of Rein can help you judge when an enemy Rein has ult and will use it. There are numerous times in-game I can see the Rein make a weird move and immediately know he has ULT and is looking for an opening. I can call it out to the seconds before purely by game sense, knowledge picked up from playing as and against specific heroes with predictable abilities and playstyles.

I've noticed this in CSGO. There was a time when I'd just autopilot and get slaughtered against a team that had a unique playstyle. It is very hard to play against a team that plays objectively *weird* and different from the norm when your team has trained against the meta styles. You'll occasionally see strange abnormality upsets with pro teams against high mechanical skill teams with no coordination.

The only way I could really fix this mid-game was to coordinate something different with my team. Change up the style and go all out. Keep motivation up and everyone focused on something a bit different to keep everyone extra focused. Turning against each other when you start losing to a meme strategy by randoms is the worst thing that can happen. 

I can expand on this more if interested, but if this has become a major frustration I'd suggest taking a day or 2 off and watch some pro player perspectives during majors and see how they react to situations. Try to avoid passively watching and instead, when something unexpected happens really study their gameplay, coms, and reactions."

I just kept blaming myself and everyone around me for my failure. I'd get so worked up beating the shit out of my desk fuming in frustration.

I really don't know what my wakeup call was, but eventually, I just stepped the fuck back and realized that it really is just a game and there is often nobody to really blame for errors. I really disliked toxic behaviour but didn't notice myself being toxic.

I started catching myself mumbling to myself about someone's performance in frustration and a moment of clarity would happen where I'd realize it really wasn't their fault and sure I died/lost in a stupid way, but it's just a game and there is even some humour to be had in what happened.

I just started laughing it off and eventually started appreciating the humour is the rediculous situations that would normally set me off.

It's been like 10+ years and I've completely changed my mentality. I see myself as a far more tolerant and friendly person now. I don't even have to catch myself starting to get frustrated anymore.

I paid $80 for this free game. Tell me more about how that's fair?

I also don't get why people are so accepting of companies gathering as much of your private info and selling it away en-mass to everyone they can. I get advertisements on a webpage but fuck right off with selling private info. That should absolutely be illegal."
