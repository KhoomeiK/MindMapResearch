SuicideWatch,flrnz7t,t3_fcayh7,1585424168.0,I wear the same outfit to work every single day. I’m sure people have noticed and I don’t care at all.
bipolar,flrifnc,t3_fqp6jg,1585420858.0,I can relate. I am in a similar situation add suicidal ideation. You have to want to change for yourself. What else do you have to lose? You’re at rock bottom (it sounds like) so the only way to go is up from here on out. If you feel lonely you can hit me up anytime. I might not reply back immediately but I will reply. I hope you feel better.

funny,ezuou48,t3_d21gwh,1568157510.0,Got somewhere to be? Assume it will take at least an hour to get there. I commute in this mess twice a day. I don’t know which rush hour is worse.

BipolarReddit,ez7t7g1,t3_d03ko7,1567728085.0,"I’ve gone down the road of “what’s the point in taking these” too many times to fall for the tricks my mind plays on me. I need these pills, yes I feel bad now but I could definitely be feeling worse. It’s a habit now. I take them with me everywhere I go even though I only take them at night. I don’t know what could happen to me through the day that would stop me from taking my meds. I keep them with me always because compliance is key 🔑 I don’t use an app, or string on my finger. I am terrified of becoming that depressed fucker again. Nothing is going to come in between me and my meds, not even myself."
bipolar,ez7s1j3,t3_d08j3c,1567727656.0,Very nice. I’m in a depressive mood as well and I wish I was handling it as well as you are.
bipolar,ez7rsdb,t3_d08jvm,1567727558.0,"I have a boyfriend and he knows I’m bipolar. I brought it up on our first date and I’m glad I did. I can’t imagine going through the episodes I’ve gone through and him not knowing what the hell was wrong with me. We wouldn’t have made it this long if I didn’t tell him. I tell people about my bipolar disorder on an as needed basis. 

It’s not easy being in a relationship when you have bipolar disorder. And it’s also not easy to date someone who’s bipolar. Sometimes I do or say the meanest things to the people I love. Especially if I’m feeling blue. It’s not that I mean to be mean, I’m just hurting.

One thing I try to do is communicate with people about how I’m feeling. If I’m moody I let the people I have to interact with know so they won’t be surprised about what I do or say. I’m feeling pretty moody at the moment honestly.

Enjoy college as much as you can and know this: there is someone out there waiting to meet you. Go out have fun, stay away from booze, and live your life."

bipolar,etjx9my,t3_cbtqc1,1562883638.0,When I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt we were not allowed to smoke cigarettes. Not even a nicotine patch. At snack time they’d bring out the sodas and it was a mad dash to get the Coke. Caffeine was the only way to escape reality. Good times
bipolar,etjvplp,t3_cc0qpz,1562882577.0,Very beautiful.
