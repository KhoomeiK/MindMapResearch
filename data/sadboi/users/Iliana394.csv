When I found out that one of my friends had put together a group of three, herself included, and beat up one of our mutual friends, I lost all respect for her. Her reasoning was that the other girl ""was ugly""... Yup, a real winner there... I haven't talked to her in almost 10 years, and I don't plan to ever do so again."

AskReddit,f428o60,t3_dj6x8l,1571328798.0,"I was on a date with a fitness instructor, and because I like walking I had asked if we could take a walk. For some reason I thought that would make it less awkward.

So, I'm a big girl, not obese, but not one of those fitness chicks with a thigh gap either. It seems like a random note, but it is important for later in the story. 

We have been walking for about 20 minutes or so, and this guy keeps asking me why I haven't had a boyfriend, to which I continuously answer, that I don't really know, it just hasn't happened yet. He talks as if he is a psychologist, who wants to know my life story. 

For some reason we begin to talk about alcohol, he tells me that he doesn't really drink because of his training and such, and as the awkward person I am, I let it slip that I sometimes get a little...""happy""... when I get drunk. To which he asks me if I might want to get it on with him, if I was drunk. Again I am sooooo awkward, so I just answered ""maybe"" even though I felt absolutely nothing for this guy. And he then assures me that he would never want to take advantage of a drunk girl. What a gentleman.

After a while he then starts talking about he has made two full body transformations, from being a big guy, to becoming fit. And then he asks me if I want to lose weight, to which I have no answer. I think I have been traumatised, because I don't remember what I said to that, or maybe it is because it's been 2 or 3 years since then. 

It gets a little more awkward, and at this point I'm sure that there isn't going to be a second date. 
I, for some reason, say yes to drive him home, because it is on my way anyway. And as soon as I start driving, he asks me if he can kiss me, and then I just stammer that I don't really know him well enough for that yet.

We get to his apartment complex, and I say no thank you to getting up with him, so we just stand and talk for a while. And then when he finally says goodbye, he asks for a hug and tells me he will give me a kiss on the cheek. It was wet...

And that is the story of one of the most awkward first dates I have been on. 

Sorry for any spelling or grammar mistakes, English isn't my first language."

AskReddit,f3yr245,t3_diqqvs,1571258186.0,"I was a really dumb kid. Here are a few examples of my dumbness. 

Numero 1: I thought the past (like before I was born, or something like that) was in Black and white, because there were only black and white pictures and movies from that time.

Nummer 2: I often put things in my mouth when I was a child, because I loved chewing on hard things (I have no idea why) but the thing I loved the most was remote controllers. I didn't chew on them, but I really liked the taste.

Number 3: I am embarrassed about how old I was when I did this one. When I was 11-12 years old I used to pray to god almost every night, because I wanted to be a part of Tokyo Mew Mew (a manga I loved back then)."
