bipolar,fr53113,t3_gmp3ch,1589901602.0,"I'm on 100mg of Lamictal nightly and have not experienced any side-effects,

however, I take Lamictal in conjunction with an anti-depressant and an anti-psychotic for my Bipolar Disorder. Lamitcal is a mood-stabilizer and does not do the same job other classes of medication do. Are you seeing a primary physician for your medicinal needs or have you seen a psychologist/psychiatrist? It may be time for a formal diagnosis from a mental health professional if you're not already seeing one.

No disrespect to your doctor, but medicating first and diagnosing later sounds unhelpful-to-dangerous (like shooting first and aiming after). If you speak with a psychologist or psychiatrist about your very real mental health symptoms, they can formally diagnose you - and diagnoses can be changed if you reveal new symptoms over time. Diagnoses do not box you in. 

Hope this helps! Definitely report your symptoms to a professional. With these sorts of symptoms, a primary doctor should be referring you to a psychiatrist. If they don't, seek one out for yourself (advocate for yourself- you're worth it)."
bipolar,fr51tpu,t3_gmp8k5,1589900987.0,"I've seen a professional I didn't mesh well with - and I sought out a new one.

If you aren't in the habit of doctor-shopping (i.e., if you haven't gone through a bunch of mental health professionals, indicating the problem could be you) it may very well be time to try a new doctor. You deserve to feel comfortable and confident with the professional you sit across from.

Also, since you used the word ""doctor"", I just want to make sure you are seeing a psychiatrist for your medications. If your primary goal is mental health treatment, that's their speciality and they are more likely to take claims concerning mental illness seriously. You may feel more listened to."

I'm curious as-to whether or not you could be having a mixed episode, but that's just armchair psychiatry talking/I couldn't be further from a professional.

On that note, are you plugged in with any psychiatrists or psychologists? It sounds like it's time to make an appointment or move and appointments you have up. They will be able to give you measured guidance on how to proceed. You deserve to live a life with as few and the mildest symptoms possible."

Reformed,fqyt4w5,t1_fqys1lq,1589754120.0,"Your wife is not mentally unwell and doesn't experience hypersexuality as a psychological symptom, which is a tremendous blessing. Regardless of your conviction, the mental health community has long-accepted hypersexuality as a hallmark of certain diagnoses.

Of course infidelity is a grave sin with grave consequences: mental illness or none. These precautions are life-saving, but are sadly not the ""end of the story"" for many families.

Psychological episodes cause crazy behavior. There is little to no rationality involved beyond studying which parts of the brain are on fire versus turned off. Sin is the result of the breakdown which caused the illness - we all agree on that. 

Bipolar infidelity is both objectively wrong and the cause of chemical malfunctions in the brain. Those two are not mutually exclusive.

Be careful to speak to what you do not know with zeal. OP and I both live with this often mischaracterized illness and have manifested similar symptoms. I have been through much torment at the hands of mania, and it is saddening when others lack understanding and mercy.

Edit: My husband is reading these comments with me and we are saddened at the lack of compassion expressed in just a handful of these comments, having both experienced what OP is describing."
Reformed,fqyob80,t1_fqxqfx1,1589751846.0,"Hi there; left a comment elsewhere on this post stating I have severe Bipolar Disorder which sparked a manic episode leading to infidelity on my part as well (I'm a woman). A basic understanding of clinical psychology will reveal mania - and other forms of psychosis - can account for all sorts of debauchery a person would otherwise not engage in. Of course, sin is the cause of all of it: the big genetic breakdown leading to the Bipolar Disorder, leading to the adultery. Do not be fooled, however: television's depiction and the world's misconception of Bipolar Disorder cannot be trusted. It's not all mood swings and erratic behavior (I, for one, consider myself to be a pretty even-tempered person). Energy states brought on by Bipolar Disorder and other mental illnesses can result in truly - literally - crazy behavior. Thus, a mental illness can be to blame for infidelity.

I did things during my manic episode I would have never, ever, ever, ever, ever wanted to do right-mindedly in a million years. People take off their clothes and run through parks while manic, and it is not because they simply gave into temptation. Thoughts which would never otherwise occur to us become present during psychological episodes, and they are difficult or impossible to control.

Don't take my word for it. Do the research: ""Fast Girl"", ""The Bipolar Disorder Survival Guide"" and ""An Unquiet Mind"" are a few great reads which further break this branch (the Bipolar branch) of psychology down.

This sister, though she must answer for her sinful behavior while manic and responsible for preventing future episodes and behavior to the best of her ability, is clean in the eyes of God by the blood of Jesus Christ. He sees clearly what she has done on account of her sinful nature versus her illness caused by the larger curse of sin."

Reformed,fqxpcvl,t3_glhgxg,1589735846.0,"I was diagnosed with BPI (with psychotic features) in April of last year. The main feature of my first-time manic episode? Hypersexuality.

My spouse has forgiven me as well, and it is important to realize your transgression has not taken God by surprise. He uses our suffering to glorify Himself. Had I not had a manic episode of the caliber I did, I would have continued to suffer undiagnosed and wouldn't have met wonderful people I'm now in a support group with - people I have had the opportunity to help. God has objectively used my transgressions for His purposes. I struggled for months with whether or not He was able to keep me safe,

but, in the end, He showed me He has bigger plans for my life than simply keeping me safe, and these plans are actually benefitting other people. So, Bipolar or not, He has my life and is doing wonderful things with it as He pleases (even though they don't feel wonderful to me at many points).

If you'd like to chat privately about our episodes, I would be willing to do that (I'm also female). You will see from my comment history I have been active in the Bipolar subreddit for a while, so I should ""check out"".

Edit: Also, the album ""Jude"" by Psallos helped me a LOT while I was spiritually recovering from manic infidelity - especially the track [the keeper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6rUmPs0AyM).
