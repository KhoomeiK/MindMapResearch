I remember at one point I begged my in laws to take my kids one night a few months in and they were too busy to. I quit asking for help and accepted it. 

Everyone gets back to their shitty fb memes pretty quick and it's almost as if you're the only one left in grief. In time, it wont sting as much and you will get used to it. 

Hugs to you. I'm so sorry for your deep loss"
widowers,fofw0od,t1_foea8br,1587743803.0,"My late husbands one year date is the 30th of this month and it took me 11 months to get to a where I am at. By day 63 I was still in the deep grief stage where I didnt think it was all real and was drinking heavily just to numb the pain at night. 

Be good to yourself and in time, while it never gets better, it does get easier to handle. Grief takes time, a lot of it, and there arent many hacks. It's amazing that you are doing counseling, but don't rush as it truly is a process. Its great you are learning some coping tools in the meantime. 

Everyone is different, but for me there was a turning point a few weeks ago that seemingly took forever. It takes time, and for now, just please dont be so hard on yourself. You WILL get to a healing place at some point in the journey, but at 63 days, man I was a MESS. 

The best advice I can give you is just live in the moment. Take everything a minute, an hour, and a day at a time. It does get easier. Not now, but eventually.

mentalillness,fo9pc0i,t1_fo83aa0,1587626527.0,Depression for me isnt a sad feeling at all so I agree. It's a sense of emptiness and hopelessness. There is hardly any feeling at all and when I actually do cry I'm happy because it usually means I can at least feel SOMETHING. Then again I've suffered this for over 20 years so I dont think it's a passing phase at this point.

We arent one dimensional and we dont have to suffer endlessly. We always have the ability to open our hearts, and when we open them, it doesnt mean we automatically forget all that made our last spouses so wonderful to be with. It doesnt mean the sadness ends and we forget them as if shutting a door on them and who they were. How could we ever forget?

It's so amazing I could love someone so deeply to feel a great and profound sense of loss, but his love inspired me to share it with others once the storm passed. I would have intense regret if I could not pass that love forward. 

You give me hope and thank you so much for sharing :)"

I was living in a void, devoid of feeling and deep depression. I didnt want to let my kids down, or anyone for that matter. My love for my boyfriend formed after I grew a love for MYSELF finally. 

Idk, I just chose the living at that point and let him rest. We always told each other we wanted the other happy, so I quit regarding new love and living life as cheating or not ""grieving properly.""

Idk if that helps but that was my thought process. It was as if something just clicked and I felt 100x better. I still love and miss him, but I allowed my guilt to die with him. He isnt coming back. I choose life."

Someone wise said wait until the first anniversary passes and I plan to tell them 3 months after.

It's not fair to have a boyfriend in the shadows. 

If they hate it, oh well. If they're supportive, great. I know they will think I never loved my late husband of 13 years, but fuck them if they think it because everyone else has been supportive and happy for me.

AskReddit,ewmhw0h,t3_cp0zft,1565552056.0,"My husband died in April, I had to delete all social media for my sanity, and I am so lonely not having intimacy anymore. Once you have it, and then lose it, it's a soul killer. I cry all the time and it's been almost 4 months. I dont have many people to talk to anymore and I'm just in a hole. I hope it gets better."
LifeProTips,ewmg6bv,t3_coydjw,1565550870.0,I just did this with all social media and holy fuck I feel so liberated. I picked all of the people I wanted to stay in contact with (very few) and my mental health has drastically improved :)))
widowers,ewlc0ku,t3_coqcy3,1565516415.0,"Congrats on trying. I'm on month 4 and I still cant fathom meeting someone new, so I just have a friend with benefits. I just feel like I wouldn't be interested although I really want someone to be with for cuddling/support. Maybe that's a bad thing though because I feel like I need to depend on myself for that. Widow life blows. I dont know what's normal."
stopdrinking,ewi4kdw,t3_coeb8g,1565438090.0,I survived my second night sober in the past 2 months after my husband died in april. This was attempt #2! I did it. I will survive tonight too. IWNDWYT
