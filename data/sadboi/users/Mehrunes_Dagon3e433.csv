Also, I can relate on the whole math issue. My Mom grounded me for weeks at a time for not getting a 70% or higher in math when she knew I was trying, but continued to belittle me and make me feel stupid. She also compared me and my brother to her sibling's cousin, saying he was super smart and why couldn't we be smart like him (he is in software engineering for college, I'm now an English literature major). 

My grades in high school went like this...   
69% Freshman year  
70% Sophomore year  
83% Junior year (because I had a teacher who understood and worked with my ADD)  
81% Senior year (Just a small drop, not a big deal).

My step-mom basically insisted on grounding me for trying to bring my grades up, then would ask what I was having a hard time with, then would tell me what I had to do based on her standards and lifestyle. She made it seem like high school and those grades were the end of the world.

2. I will encourage their hobbies/careers, even if I don't understand them.

5. I will make sure their college tuition is saved/paid for (community college first though, I'll even pay for an apartment if they want to move out still). I know this point sounds ridiculous, but my parents made good money and squandered it on $40,000 trucks, $400,000 homes (no, their income wasn't nearly high enough for this), and didn't save a dime for college funds, then expected me to pay to go to college.

In order to fix my work history to get into a receptionist position I borrowed a family business name and put that on my resume in order to find work. Yes, this is not a good idea. Don't do this specifically, obviously.

My point being that if you're not having luck getting interviews, tailor your resume to fix the problems that you're facing. It's hard finding work, but it's harder when what you're using to apply doesn't work.

To create a better resume, I would strongly suggest creating a custom resume (templates sucks). List out your Objectives (might need to make 2 or 3 resumes for this, just change wording), Skills, Certifications, Education, then Work history, References, etc.

Also, make sure to write a custom cover letter for each place you apply for. And if possible, I would suggest applying to only 3-5 jobs a day. Don't stress out over job hunting... that usually leads to bad habits and interview problems. Last thing, if you need work while applying to various different places, I would suggest finding temp offices/work.  


One last thing... always follow up if possible. And send a thank you email/thank the people over the phone for their time. A mix of professional and personal courtesy goes a long way."

depression,fi595xl,t1_fi56kj9,1582157747.0,"Sooooo... I've spent a lot of my life identifying and being identified as a musician. Because of this, I was interested in studying anthropology while I was in college. I wanted to understand parts of music that confused me, namely genres I didn't necessarily enjoy and genres I had yet to hear of.

From 2014-2016, I was in college full time, completing prerequisites and anthropology classes. After a certain point, I had to do a capstone course.

I should also note that the paper was 30 pages, not 15. My bad. Late night when I wrote my post.

So, as sad as they come, I decided to do my capstone paper on music, more specifically on rock music. By the time I was Midway through the semester, I realized that the amount of research I had amounted to almost nothing. The max number of pages I could write would be 5 to 10 pages at most. And I only had two months left to write a 30 page paper. 

So I did what any student who is about to fail the culmination of their studies would do, at least I hope.

I dropped the class. 

It was crushing to my mental state, because for a long time I associated music as an area of expertise for me, and also the primary component to my identity. I had vaguely assumed that I could do anything I wanted with it as long as I had some foresight, but that wasn't the case.

I would end up taking one more class until November of 2018, and I had to drop that class due to financial troubles and car troubles. 

From 2017-2019, I did a lot of reading philosophy and spiritual things in order to cope with my perceived failures. I simultaneously worked in sales, joined some bands where I lived, and tried to understand myself as an individual again. 

I know that it might seem ridiculous to get caught up emotionally in academia and failing as a musician, but most mainstream media only talks about the thousands of winners, not the millions upon millions of people who fail to do the things they've always wanted to do. 

Losing a big part of my identity is a big reason why I felt so alone last year. It's also because of that that I decided to go back to college to finish up, while also making a new goal for studying. My new goal for studying is to not assume that I know anything, and to absorb information instead of believing my assumptions are always right. 

I will say that college wasn't necessarily the answer to fixing my problems, nor was it the cause of my problems. Much of my issues were a personal struggle that I had to fix outside of school. Working in soul-crushing sales, getting involved with druggies (like cocaine addicts, only an observer never a user), and seeing the world through a more thoughtful lens caused me to realize that much of my issues were personal and financial. 

Since my identity crisis, I've put out an electronic music EP, a rock guitar EP, I have two friends I still talk to (made friends with them in 2019, though they lived across the United States in PA. I now live in Colorado), and I am more appreciative of the opportunities that I have.

Should also note I am majoring in English now, and want to work in social services in the future. By the time I graduate, I will have been in college for 6-7 years, minus a year and a half gap, and I will be 25-26 years old by graduation.

I guess my main point here is that we might perceive ourselves in black and white, but we're more than that. I might play music, but I am also a son, a brother, a broke person, a friend, introverted, a volunteer etc. Etc.

Failing at things is a part of this, but I also acknowledge failure as a cruel stepping stone, not an end-all-be-all."

Whether or not they become the leader of the companions or the College of Winterhold's archmage, there will always be a portion of the Dragonborn that exists within the fate of the character.

Now, what if the prisoner dies and doesn't fulfill his duty to kill Alduin? At that point, either a new prisoners, under the same time and scenario, would take up the mantle of the prophecied Dragonborn, or the prisoner's fate would never have existed to begin with. Since The Elder Scrolls has previously dealt with time events in which everything happens at once (particularly when it's Elder Scrolls based a la The Warp in the West), the player character may always be a prisoner attempting to fight Alduin, save Martin Septim, or become the reincarnated Nerevarine.

Mages in Skyrim enhance their own staves and robes though. A staff that does 8 pts of fire damage could do up to 12 pts of fire damage as a mage.

In that case, I would say lorewise as well that master enchanters typically had mastery of magic as well, as magic is likely what led them to become master enchanters in the first place (a la Mannimarco's Necromancer Amulet, the staff of Magnus, Neloth's staff enchanter, named staffs located across Skyrim including the staff of Arcane Authority).

Magic users in Skyrim are feared and ostracized. Pull out spells in the cities and guards yell ""Whoa whoa whoa! Watch the magic"" or ""Go cast your fancy magic someplace else"". 

This same rhetoric seems to stem from the fact that the Nordic races have always been at war with the elves (Dwemer, Dunmer, Falmer, and now the Altmer). Because most elves always had mysterious magic connections to aetherius and even sought to harm and purge the nords out of Skyrim a la Saarthal, it makes sense that Skyrim, which is now primarily populated by Nords, would have a lack of mage users that we have knowledge of up to straight up mages, including spellswords and nightblades."

Maybe Sheogorath knew the Champion would succeed and planted himself as Haskill, producing a live version of Sheogorath so that he could later retake his throne back after the Greymarch happened."
