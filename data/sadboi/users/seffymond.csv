depression,fhxnail,t3_f51oky,1581958158.0,"Same. And instead of letting me draw which is my happiness and I'm actually earning from commissions and giving her a whole month of earnings(which is already the minimum wage of my place), she basically forces her dreams on me. Like working in a bank. I actually passed the exam and I'll be going on an interview this Wednesday. And I know, even if I'll get accepted, I might quit when things get too rough. I'd rather draw than watching people do worldly stuff."

It's the fifth book of a series but I didn't feel like I missed something reading it. It's not the best, very short, and I think I just read an erotica. Lol"

Even the covers, I actually glance at the cover everytime I pick up the book that I'm reading. My brain deeply associates digital devices with audio-visuals. I know content is what matters but I'm very materialistic, I guess. It's terrible but I can't help it. Lol"

I always believe that once a snake, always a snake. I have a friend who outed me because of this, we're still friends because I gave up trying so hard to get rid of her. But I never tell her secrets again and remind her everytime that I don't want my secrets announced. And yes, she still does this to everyone.

We have used book stores here and I usually buy books that actually cost about half a dollar. Oh how I love those stores! The problem is, I live in a small town and I actually have to travel 3 hours to the next city to buy these cheap books. I imagine a day when I could finally buy gorgeous new hardcover books and sniff their aroma day by day!"

But gosh, sometimes I regret it. They won't stop making gay jokes against me, matching me to every guy, asking me why don't I pay straight guys whenever I'm single and etc. It's like my sexuality is my whole personality.

depression,farl0e4,t3_ea539h,1576317255.0,"Same here, 22, unemployed. Had two jobs before, but both drained me to the point of crying. I am not suitable to corporate office at all and my Mom won't let me work jobs such as a mall cashier, sales rep and stuff. I really wanted to work in libraries, book stores, or other quiet places but in my small town, I don't see any opportunities. And worse, I don't have money to go out of town to look for my ideal jobs. So I just ""waste"" my time at home reading. My friends also make me uncomfortable so I don't talk to them much. I'm pretty happy lost in my own world but when people start talking and pushing their expectations on me, I just lose hope."
depression,faqfht4,t3_ea9h8q,1576302317.0,"For me, I just avoid going to family gatherings as much as possible because I know for sure that I can't hide my sadness. Especially when they ask why I still don't have a job and why I discountiued freelance drawing(it's difficult freelancing without a support system). I'm tired of listening to their lectures that I'm just lazy so I don't work, despite being an achiever in school and in college. I don't want to bother them with my drama(as they call it). And heck, my mom forces me to go so I still end up going once a month."
AMA,faqbx23,t3_eadkl3,1576300931.0,"I(m) also had my first sexual encounter to an older babysitter(15m) when I was 9 years old. I had always been effiminate but I'm pretty sure I'm already gay before this happened. We were playing with each other, tickling and stuff and it got to the point that I was on top of him, and kinda tickled his butt. He found this funny and did the same to me until it got to the point where he was rubbing his thing on me. He also let me do this to him. I was a late bloomer so I never had any erections at that time and every encounter. He liked this and he did it repeatedly especially at night, I didn't object since I was also curious(no penetration). Just like you, it didn't really feel overpowering and he even want me to do the same so I always had the impression that that was a form of consent in my part. Now that I am an adult, I'm somehow incapable of intimacy with others and I find myself thinking(and somehow yearning) about him. 

So here are the questions:

1. To OP, do you find yourself yearning for her?
2. To anyone, is my experience considered abuse? Is he a pedophile? Cuz' it sure didn't feel like it and 15 is pretty young."
