I grew up using the mouse right handed and in some ways prefer to be able to perform basic keyboard shortcuts easier with my dominant hand than to switch. It probably kills the possibility of me ever being able to play FPS games good though. Other than that, there may be a couple things that don't really correspond to a handedness in my opinion that some may call right handed. Things like opening lids seem to be split to me. I personally prefer to have my right hand on the lid so more stabilization and torque is in my left hand. My right hand is clumsier than my left, so I'm more likely to spill things holding the container with my right. I only switch the other way when needed which is very rare.

TrueChristian,fonm2y0,t1_fonkr4e,1587922107.0,Thank you. Yeah. I feel like I have constantly been criticized for being who I am.

That is about the time I notice my self esteem started to take a turn for the worst when that was going on along with all sorts of other stuff. I will really try to get over it though so I can feel comfortable with being myself.
TrueChristian,foniwt8,t1_fomn3ji,1587920365.0,Thank you. You have about the most encouraging comment so far. I was going to counseling prior to the whole pandemic.

I have been going to a Christian school for years. I felt decent when I started there. However, as the years have went by, I have felt worse and worse. I have never really made any close friends in my life. I have always been lonely. I really try to be a good person towards others, but it doesn’t really help. I am really sorry for sounding this way.

DataHoarder,fo5ldij,t1_fo5jrfe,1587528529.0,"So you’re telling me I am seeing only 30 frames per second out of an interlaced image? It sure doesn’t feel like it. I thought standard TV was 60 perceived frames per second by the use of interlacing(with the exception 720p channels being technically broadcast in 720p 60 FPS without interlacing). I am watching on my computer monitor just for reference, but my TV isn’t even one of the types that tries to smooth the image."
DataHoarder,fo5kbh8,t1_fo5jx3u,1587527752.0,Yeah. I have experienced that in the past. Is there a way to convert the interlaced image to progressive though without losing the smooth look?
DataHoarder,fo5jnhp,t1_fo5d19s,1587527275.0,It’s mainly so I can upload it to YouTube in 60 FPS. YouTube doesn’t support 60 FPS on normal videos less than 720p.

It does say 29.97 FPS on the recording, but I figured that was just some sort of deinterlace placebo giving that listing. I just want whatever I encode to be as smooth as the original and be able to be uploaded to YouTube with that framerate. If this will magically look super smooth on YouTube with the original recording, I will just use that instead. I’m not an editing expert, but my original recording looks about excessively smooth to not be 60 FPS."

However, I feel like I have lost much of my personality years ago and I have been struggling to find it again. I get completely dysphoric at times because I have no clue who I am. The only thing that seems to be able to make me happy is to use my imagination in some form. Without that imagination, nothing seems to be able to make me happy. I can't find much beyond that though besides what I do with my imagination. I am truly trying to figure things out, but it is a major struggle for me."

I like that example though and hope to remember that to try to help with it. She has blocked me on some social medias, however I ended up just browsing without an account/making another account instead. I have convinced myself already to not talk to her unless she talks to me. I truly do want the best for her and I really want to see her succeed with who she is. Part of why I stalk her though is because I feel guilty for creeping her out. I know that sounds weird, but that is part of what it is as I think about it every day."

I know it's creepy still, I just have nowhere I know of to turn to though. My social life doesn't give me very good feelings. I feel disconnected from myself.

I can't test it often because I only know of it on one tower in my area, that being the same tower I have seen band 4 on before in my area. I am not on that side of town all the time though.

These days I think my speech relatively okay. However, I think my tone does sound a bit funny in certain situations and my social anxiety is so extreme that it often keeps me from talking.

aspergers,fmdkyty,t3_ftx9hv,1585970517.0,"I can often hear a CRT noise on the rare occasion I can use one today. I can also feel static electricity around the screen that has always kinda aroused me as a child. I can even smell them. Sometimes I can also hear a high pitched hum coming from some some electronics. I think a lot of it is coil whine. My hearing I don’t think is superb though, so I don’t hear it that often."

aspergers,fm7xzjl,t3_fth16t,1585839043.0,"Gore doesn't really bother me. There are many times I like it. However, I do have issues with other things though. Needles have a tendency to make me uncomfortable."
aspergers,fm7xltt,t3_ftm501,1585838835.0,"It's an okay movie I guess, but I don't like being compared to him. I don't really feel connected to him at all. It's almost like he's a completely different kind of autistic than I am. I am not really a savant though, so it kinda separates me from a lot of the autism representations in media. The same thing happens with the Good Doctor and I only watch it to give me and my mom something to watch."
aspergers,fm6pz5w,t3_ftcn2t,1585800049.0,My dad has told me he believes most autistic people are really just normal people. So that honestly confuses me with what actually constitutes as autistic.

It drives it crazy to hear through my right ear, so even if I’m holding it with my right hand, I still reach it across to my left ear."
aspergers,fm2e36o,t3_fsiink,1585695640.0,Well. I have issues hearing but I don't know if it's exactly what you describe. I do not believe I've ever made myself pass out before. I was also a late potty trainer though. I was potty trained around age 4.
aspergers,flzwbjj,t3_frxc9z,1585635659.0,I love my pop. It is very uncommon for me to not have at least one a day. It’s a good feeling to me. I just don’t really like diet drinks though because I don’t like the idea of artificial sweeteners. So I only drink the real stuff.
aspergers,flzw29i,t3_fruquj,1585635407.0,Yes. For years I have been extremely hard on myself. I’m not sure what caused it exactly. Part of me thinks it may be from people punishing or criticizing seemingly every quirky thing about me. I feel I’ve lost my personality because of it and now desperately want it back.
buildapc,flv6k9s,t1_flv5rgw,1585517434.0,I might do that. Thank you
buildapc,fluzqew,t1_fluzonc,1585513392.0,Ok. That might work. Thank you.

buildapc,fluz3q3,t1_fluytfl,1585513022.0,"I would say not much more than $300, but I’m not 100% decided where I land on that. I mainly just don’t want to burn all my money and want the best price to performance I can get for 1440p gaming. I would even go for a cheaper card if there is a better choice."
aspergers,flsfkvu,t3_fqh80c,1585441009.0,"I was diagnosed just after this age at around 6 in the later half of the 2000s, so I think you are pretty early considering my mom was so worried about me as a child. Sometimes I wonder if some of the really early diagnosis’s could be too early to tell for sure."
aspergers,flsf0yq,t3_fqifji,1585440655.0,"I feel strongly that I have lost my identity. I feel like I have hidden myself and now I have no personality. I hid myself because people seemed to ignore and reject me. I really just want myself back badly. I wish I could help, but I can’t as I am battling the same way now."
aspergers,flsepze,t3_fqm7x5,1585440461.0,"I personally like it. I do believe it comes with some cool things. I used to struggle more with the idea, but I have accepted it way more and now I have decided I would never want to change it. I would never want any autistic person to have to be changed to be someone they’re not. I just wish I could be more comfortable with myself in general. I have lost my personality I think and I really want it back now that I’m tying to learn to not hate myself."
