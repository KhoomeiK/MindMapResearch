relationship_advice,fqmlsl6,t3_gjhipx,1589479564.0,"As someone who was also raised by abusive parents I understand how you feel. The hyper vigilance of abusive behavior while also doubting if you’re overreacting. However, this is NOT NORMAL!!! If your boyfriend knows you’re more sensitive towards any signs of violence/ freeze up he should be even more aware of what he is doing. His response when he’s angry is to physically grab you. That can and will escalate especially when it happens the second time he’s gaslighting you/ making you question yourself. RUN!!!!!!! He’s starting to make you walk on eggshells now, this is not healthy!!! Please trust your gut on this."
lupus,fqmg2we,t3_gjg411,1589476864.0,I know this is kinda a stupid tip and I don’t even know why I thought of this but the first thing that came to mind is getting an ergonomic mouse might be a great investment. I need to use the mouse a lot and when my joints flared a good mouse really helped. Anyways good luck and hope you feel better soon. :)
lupus,fpwp0fj,t3_gfv7yg,1588967347.0,My urine had so much bubbles and not the small foamy gone in a few seconds kind. I drink loads of water per day(like maybe 3-4 liters) so that was what made me noticed something was wrong.
raisedbynarcissists,fotrbpx,t1_fosaog5,1588063358.0,I relate so much to this. I understand how you feel. Thank you for sharing

MonolidMakeup,fnurj2h,t1_fnu7iam,1587269216.0,"I searched and its called “uzu eye opening liner by flowfushi”. Its a japanese brand. Theres around 13 colors and a liquid liner pen with brush tip. Around ~20 dollars in my country (not US). Not the cheapest, but the best for value in my opinion. 

Good luck! Monolids take awhile to figure out so don’t give up!"
MonolidMakeup,fnqjpqj,t3_g2v7av,1587165977.0,"I hate the thick black liner look so I usually just draw the tail part to make my eyes look less droopy. If I do the thick liner look I usually use a lighter color or colorful kohl pencil/gel liner and top with an eyeshadow on top to make the line less graphic and more soft. I also have very oily eyelids and I have found that eye primer really does help. For super hot and sweaty days I usually pack shadow onto the liner and then reapply liner on top again. One liner that I really like is the uzu liner in brown. (Granted without topping with shadow/primer it will still slide off)

Another choice when I was younger was eyelid glue. I’ve always prefer them to the tapes. Lashes also helps but I can always see them."

raisedbynarcissists,fnn0y1q,t1_fnmzu02,1587082090.0,They really are! My parents played the picture perfect parents for outsiders. No one even questioned it. To them it was always me who had problems. Through out my childhood there were maybe a couple of adults that were always kind and patient despite all of my issues.
raisedbynarcissists,fnmzzko,t1_fnmuyre,1587081528.0,Thank you so much. I’ve never wanted children because the thought of another child potentially turning out like me is just too much. I’m still struggling to unlearn a lot of what I’ve been taught. Even now when I’m trying to be more self aware some actions still slip past.
raisedbynarcissists,fnmz638,t1_fnmog4j,1587081050.0,"I’m also sorry you had to experience that.

I don’t struggle with it as much because I rarely see any relatives. As a kid I’ll see my grandma (she’s the only grandparent I ever knew, other passed before I was born) maybe once every 2-3 years, so we were never close. Also from what I gathered from other relatives, my grandma was beaten a lot by my grandfather so I can see why she thinks its normal. 

The most resentment I have is probably towards a lot of teachers. As far as I can remember, I was a troubled kid who had violent outbursts through out kindergarten to grade school. I had a lot of teachers picked on, singled out, and bully me instead of trying to understand why a normally quiet and attentive student would suddenly get in a fight with another student. At that age I honestly had no idea what I was doing wrong or why I wasn’t liked. I was simply acting like how my parents always acted."
raisedbynarcissists,fnme1yj,t3_g2hzfl,1587069752.0,"Yes. I still sometimes get anxious over every little thing. 

Early into the relationship with my boyfriend I went over to his apartment to wait for him. I got hungry so went and made some toast. Then I totally forgot about it and it got burned. I panicked so hard and was opening every door, window, and fan to get the smell out. He came home right in the middle of it and I just broke down crying and saying “I’m sorry, please don’t get mad, please don’t yell at me” over and over again."
raisedbynarcissists,fnm7zq2,t3_g2aqdr,1587066682.0,"My parents would tell me not to cry when they hit me. If I continued crying they just hit me harder. Also when I cry they always make it about them, saying things like “It hurts me so much more so don’t cry”"

mentalhealth,fn1g0c9,t1_fn1fpvx,1586561235.0,Thank you for answering. I’m asking because I am struggling with my diagnosis. I suspect that I might have bpd but don’t know how to go about asking for help.

relationship_advice,fm0gedv,t1_fm0bww7,1585656963.0,I mean most of the time he’s a really good friend and we have fun. He’s usually not an asshole to me but he can be to other people and it can get ugly. I don’t know how to deal with that fact. Or whether it is my problem at all.
relationship_advice,fm0g8iz,t1_fm0bww7,1585656825.0,"Not insult directly, but he does ask for personal advice a lot. And in most of the conflicts its hard to side with any of his actions. Its just so extremely different from what I believe is the ‘right’ thing to do. Its not ambiguously right or wrong for me most of the time, its just plain bad. 

He got into a fight with one of his friends(I’ll call him Jason) that I don’t personally know, over Jason’s girlfriend. Jason and Mike work together in Jason’s home office to reduce cost. Jason’s girlfriend comes over sometimes. That can be distracting, I know. But they once had a discussion where everyone present was laughing but Mike got mad that Jason’s girlfriend was also laughing because ‘she’s not one of the team’. I just thought he was a major asshole because why would you get mad over someone laughing along with you. He told me this information himself in hopes of getting me to side with him. He also told Jason’s girlfriend to her face that she’s a free loading gold digger (which is funny because she’s richer than all of them combined but we also have mutual friends so I know she assist with a lot of the projects). In the end Mike and Jason stopped being friends, Mike and Jason company failed but during the whole thing I kept trying to point out the obvious asshole things he did which he disregard and only listened to the things that I agreed with him."
relationship_advice,fm0f6vj,t1_fm0brer,1585655887.0,"Yeah, like if I get not having the same hobbies and stuff like that. But its more than that. 

For example: When covid started getting more serious I was one of those panicky people calling for social distancing( I have an autoimmune disease). My friend have an MA interview coming up and he has to do it via skype instead of in person. I sympathize with him I really do. However, he said that he will email to ask the administration if he can still fly to do the interview in person. I asked if that was wise to even be travel abroad when you should be staying at home. And if he did go, would he have enough money to quarantine himself for 2 weeks before the interview. He couldn’t understand why he needed to quarantine himself before the interview when he was low risk. 

We argued and I told him he wasn’t thinking about anyone but himself. That he was considering putting the uni staff, the interviewers and everyone else at risk. And the email clearly stated that they would not be doing any in-person interviews so its not like other candidates have an advantage over him. In the end I decided to drop the subject because I was getting too stressed out and its a sensitive subject for me. I told him to not discuss the pandemic with me again. A few days later he sent multiple articles, graphs and fb posts to me. I didn’t click to read any and told him it was stressing me out and to please stop. He still tries to bring up how unfair all of this is to him. Even though he did acknowledge that I was high risk and how stressing this is for me.

Sorry that was long. This was just an example. However, he has this self-centered view on everything, and often plays the victim. We have discussed this before and he said I am judgmental and self righteous among other things."
lupus,flkzs09,t3_fp7wka,1585250892.0,"I’m 22 and was diagnosed at 15-16 too, though I am currently not taking any medication. Respiratory infection is so common with me that I am scared too. Lately been getting really intense nightmare, sleep paralysis and panic attacks. I also was in quarantine way before my country issued a curfew. (We’re also one of the first countries to be infected.) I understand you so much! You are not alone! Stay strong and maybe find something to distract yourself and keep off the news. Sending you lots of love <3"
lupus,fjhx4gy,t1_fjhl9w7,1583356671.0,"Honestly, even though I have stopped if for years I feel like the side effects still lingers. Maybe its due to me using it for a lot of my teen years or my already pre existing problems but I think I developed depression and insomnia because of it. My hair isn’t as thick as it used to be. It’s not patchy anymore so I’m not complaining but it used to be a lot fuller. My metabolism is also now shit, I used to never get fat, don’t know if its the meds or the illness or just age. I gained around 20 kg total and 4-5 years later I’ve manage to only lose about half of that."
TikTokCringe,ff5zf84,t1_ff5c855,1579615103.0,"I met my best friend though instagram. Granted we live in the same city, are the same age and have a lot of mutual friends, its not that weird to meet up. She told me when we first started chatting she was quite wary of me, we’re both artist and she thought I wanted to get free art. Over the years we’ve become quite close so it is quite possible to become friends. 

I also have instagram friends from other countries that I chat with regularly, would send stuff to, and some have said that if I ever visit their country I could crash at their place and they’ll show me around. So its not that weird to think of visiting one of them or anything like that."

A drawer full of watercolor supplies, a media I’ve not and would probably not master. Numerous high quality sketchbooks that I stockpile because they’re ‘on sale’ but I never use because they are too good for my current skills.

AskReddit,f7rriaz,t3_dxf5xh,1573986256.0,"I was walking with a friend and there was this dark shortcut that we would always frequent. It wasn’t a long stretch of road but it was dark and isolated. I saw a guy walking out of the shortcut and he looked a bit out of it, my gut was screaming to turn back but I didn’t. After entering the shortcut I get this bad feeling so I turn and look back, the guy was walking back towards us. So I looked at my friend and he noticed my fear. We both ran, thankfully someone was taking a smoke break outside of one of the building at the end of the shortcut. I went and stood next to her and look back. The guy sees there is someone else and he puts something back into his pocket. Then, he just turned back towards the shortcut and quickly walked away. 


I think if it had not been for the smoker we would have been robbed and possibly stabbed. I always avoid that shortcut now even when we come in bigger groups. As a woman, I am now extra paranoid and would always look over my shoulder even when there is no one there."
mentalhealth,f74eb81,t3_du9dad,1573401188.0,"Coming from someone who also self harms, better self harm than to bottle it up and do something even worse.  Nothing helps as much as cutting does for me. I can stop for days or months but when everything else fails cutting has always help. So I tell myself better cut now than killing myself later.

I hope that one day you won’t need it anymore but until then take care of yourself afterwards. xx"

mentalhealth,f45qys7,t3_djjm08,1571390903.0,"I’ve been having this kind of feeling my whole life and I’ve find it really hard to explain to people/psychiatrist/therapist. I don’t know if its the same as what you’re feeling but I constantly talk to myself like I’m not really myself but someone else. 

Sometimes I feel so disassociated that I would feel like everything that is happening is not real and would have to try to reason myself to believe its real. It started as long as I can remember. When I was younger I wouldn’t do things like complete assignments that was crucial to my grade because I felt like it wasn’t real. One time I snapped out of it because a friend couldn’t stand me not doing it and started doing it for me and I felt super guilty. 

Recently, I was in an uncomfortable position on a motorcycle and I just thought if I let go I wouldn’t have to deal with sitting in an uncomfortable position. It almost didn’t register to me that if I let go I could have died.

The disassociation became too much after I came back on my anti anxiety medication. I feel no guilt or anxiety which I theorized is what always kept me grounded enough to know that everything is actually real."
