depression,fedq5o2,t3_eog11q,1579017482.0,I understand how you feel and also understand that this over thinking is not something you can voluntarily control. All I want to say is that you're not alone and you're much more worthy than you think you are. Life is difficult and don't let anyone tell you otherwise but not bad thing that happens is your fault. I too feel the same way at times but I just force myself to think that IT'S NOT MY FAULT and just shrug it off. Try it and it might work for you as well. Sending hugs and love your way.
depression,fedp73m,t3_ee58qm,1579016883.0,"I can feel your pain and I too feel the same way when some of my family members and friends treat depression like it's a matter of choice or sign of weakness or being 'too emotional'.

Not everyone will understand you but there will be some who would and you're better off sharing your thoughts and feelings with them instead of your mom.

Sending love and hugs your way. Hang in there, brighter days are just round the corner."
