worldbuilding,fmeiyhs,t3_fuk2ib,1586005410.0,"So in Soltavi, the most spoken language in the little world I created, their planet is called Ygg, after the dragon that lay an egg in space a long, long time ago. See, the ruling species of the planet are Ygglevan, and evolved from an ancient type of lizard. There are dragons on this planet, and in some parts of the world, share a symbiotic relationship with the Ygglevan. 

After the first dragon rider managed to fly high enough to see the vague shape of the planet, he concluded that it was a giant egg, laid by an ancient dragon, who was roaming space, and  decided that this was the best spot to lay the egg. They try to avoid their own version of global warming so that the egg won't hatch, thus destroying the world. Therefore, the majority of the world's population try to practice sustainable living. In the countries that share that belief, using anything that might endanger the planet is illegal. 

There is, however, a large group of people who believe that they must help the egg to hatch, because it is unethical to leave a baby dragon in such a cramped space. Their main idea is to try to find a different place to live, because eventually the baby dragon will grow too big to be contained within its shell. 

One of the stories in this world is about an expedition of atheists who try to prove that the planet is not, in fact, an egg, and that there is no baby dragon sleeping there."

WritingPrompts,fld57d4,t3_fnzhpu,1585056840.0,"Jasper and Amy were lying on a blanket on the roof of their apartment building. It was the eve of the last month of the Disaster Year, as people liked to call it. Disaster after disaster had struck and people were convinced it was going to be the end of the world.

But it wasn't. Or so it seemed, at first. Through fires, and plagues; through the threat of war and the threat of nuclear disasters; through Earth-shattering earthquakes and massive hurricanes - the humans braved through the year 2020, and now it was finally coming to an end.

""We can't get worse than this,"" said a representative in the UN. ""From here, we can only climb up - and that is what we shall swear to do.""

And so Amy and Jasper were lying on the gravel-covered roof, on an old blanket they liked to use for evenings like these. It was cold, sure, but it was supposed to snow - and they loved the first snow of the season. But alas, the sky was clear, and instead, it was a session of frosty star-gazing. They didn't know many constellation. They knew how to find Orion and how to find the Big Dipper but that was about it.

However, they were having trouble finding Orion's belt.

""It's supposed to be there, isn't it?"" Jasper asked, pointing to where the belt was supposed to be.

""No,"" Amy shook her head. ""Orion's belt is *three* stars. I only see two.""

""Maybe there's like a cloud blocking it or something,"" Jasper suggested. ""It's getting cold Amy,"" he sad. ""Let's go back in.""

Amy nodded in agreement and sat up. They shook the blanket and folded it, and carried it down the ladder and back into their apartment. It was nine in the evening, and tomorrow was going to be a long day.

\*\*\*

Up in the skies, several thousand kilometres away, a space station was orbiting the Earth - the International Space Station, to be exact. On it were five astronauts, who were, at the moment Jasper and Amy noticed the missing star from Orion's belt, doing research that had nothing to do with the cosmos.

However, the people back on Earth who did like looking at stars that were situated light-years away, were quite disturbed by the same thing that seemed to Jasper and Amy as simply a cloud hanging in front of a constellation.

""Alnitak is gone,"" one of the scientists who were doing very science-y stuff in their lab commented. He quickly texted another scientist friend on the other side of the world who also enjoyed staring at stars and getting money for it, who confirmed the suspicion, remarking that a few other stars had disappeared.

After an hour or so, astronomers all around the world were awake and E-Mailing each other to talk about the strange disappearance of stars in the sky.

It took about half a day for the whole thing to reach several world leaders.

The prime ministers of England, Italy and France, along with the Chancellor of Germany, the President of the United States and several other old, fat, white people (and Xi Jingping) were having a conference about the state of the universe, and realized that it was best to not warn the population about what could just be insignificant.

One astronomer, Dr. Charles Leisy, was writing in his journal, debating on whether he should anyway go to the news with this story.

*After all*, he wrote, *this is more than just a fluke. So far, we've counted 50 stars that have disappeared without a trace and without any conceivable explanation. Some of them were as young as a few million year. None of them died, or exploded. No new supernovas were discovered. Those stars - they just disappeared.*

A sweat drop fell to the page and blotted out the ink. Leisy sighed and tapped his pen on the hardwood table. His gaze fell on his phone, but then turned back to the paper.

*There are, however, billions of stars in the sky. Billions! If every day, fifty stars disappear, it could take millions of years before our own sun disappears and we're left to die alone in the darkness.*

*But there are still other things to count in,* Leisy continued. He sighed again and looked at his watch. It was getting late. His wife and children were already sleeping. *Ignorance is bliss,* he wrote, finally. *But is bliss truly worth not being able to prepare for what's to come? Can we not be happy knowing that there will be an end, and being able to prepare for it, rather than be taken by surprise when we finally die of hypothermia? Why should we have to carry pain on few, narrow shoulders, when we can all carry a little bit of it together?*

*We have been through worse,* Leisy said. *And I believe that the trials of this terrible year is proof, that we can shoulder anything - even the death of all the stars in the sky.*

Leisy capped his pen and closed his notebook. He picked up his phone and tapped the screen. For a minute or so he played with the contacts list, scrolling up and down, playing around. He was hesitant. And he knew that this would not end well. He took a deep breath and crossed his heart. He clicked on a contact he knew worked in media and woke his friend up.

""Guillaume, good evening,"" Leisy said.

""Do you know what time it is, Charles?"" Guillaume asked.

""Yes, but I have a story for you. Do you have a pen near?""

\*\*\*

It took a week for the story to spread around the world, and in that week, hundreds of stars had disappeared. Many have noticed that the phenomenon was nearing the Earth, and it was going to take much shorter than several million years for the sun to disappear. After two weeks, the estimation was that by the end of December, the sun, too, will be gone.

Dr. Charles Leisy was asked to talk in a conference in Geneva about how to prepare. ""Once the sun will be gone, there will be eight and a half minutes for us to live, I estimate.""

""Then what?"" a reporter asked. ""We'll just die?""

Leisy was going to answer, but another reporter interrupted. ""Can't we do something? Leave the planet? Find somewhere else?""

""Leave where?"" Leisy asked. ""All the stars in the universe are disappearing. Before we can leave we will freeze to death.""

""What about the people on the International Space Station?"" The first reporter asked. ""Are they coming back or are they staying up in orbit?""

""What will happen to the Earth?""

""What will happen to other planets?""

More questions shot through - in English, in French, in Swiss and in German. Leisy couldn't stand the stress. In that moment, Leisy fell to the ground, and stared at the ceiling. He felt as if an elephant was sitting on his chest.

\*\*\*

Two more weeks passed.

Japser and Amy were lying on the roof of their apartment building. They were counting the stars. Five. They counted five stars, and the sixth one was on the other side of the Earth.

""Four,"" Amy said. ""There."" She pointed. Her other hand was holding her hubsand's. In the last two weeks, they had decided it was time to tie the knot. They did it in court, with only their parents and siblings present, and one best friend for each.

""Three, now,"" Jasper said. ""And two.""

Their heads turned to each other. A tear was welling up in Amy's eyes.

They sat up, and looked at the last star they could see.

""One,"" they said together. They embraced each other. They felt the cold swarm over them like a blanket of ice.

""Zero,"" Jasper whispered.

""Eight minutes, remember?"" Amy asked.

""Eight minutes and we're dead.""

""It was a terrible year,"" Amy remarked.

""I think it was great, actually,"" Jasper said. ""We got married, remember?""

""And now we die.""

""And now we die.""

The tears streaming down their faces froze, and frostbite came all too quickly. But they couldn't feel the pain. They couldn't feel their limbs fall off, because by then, they were deep in slumber.

And so was the rest of the world.

Like, Greek Mythology nerds are chill. They just refuse to read books they know will annoy them, like Percy Jackson. 

But History nerds? You can't watch any movie with a Historry nerd. Don't even try to show them the History channel unless you're trying to power a team engine. And once you ask them why they're angry you've got yourself a free, six-hour lecture about the invention of bras. 

A business nerd, on the other hand, is only annoying when they are an analyst or something or rather and their boss decided to invest in something. Then they'll go tk any family member who has slightly more money in their bank acvount than average and said nerd will go on a speech about why you must invest in X business and how much money it's gonna make. And how the DOW is down and where the fuck is all the money going then?

Hint - orange juice and Zoom. 

Soirce - my bro is a business nerd. I told him that if they should invest in anything it's Zoom because everybody's using it and lo and behold people are buying shares in Zoom now so i was not wrong. 

One of my bffs is a history nerds. Her favorite genre is memoirs. Memoirs are her friend. Don't turn on the History channel bext to her. Ever."
talesfromcallcenters,fkyd27s,t1_fkxpk89,1584646328.0,"At the call centre i worked at we were required to document rvery call, or attempt at making a call, we had with a customer.

So if we called back a customer, we would write in the comments ""attempt #X to call at HH:mm dd-MM-yyyy. No answer""

So that sometime I would have a call from a customer saying ""you promised you'd call me back"" and I'd say ""we did"" and then say the exact time we called."
