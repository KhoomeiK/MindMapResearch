AmItheAsshole,fqjetg9,t1_fqhkszi,1589408939.0,"Okay this is incorrect. You can get treatment for an ED without being at a certian BMI. I was treated for an eating disorder and I forsure didn't have a low BMI. I had all the symptoms of an ED (restricting, obsessive weighing, purging, etc.) And I was able to get help for it. An ED doesn't have a one size fits all. You can be any size with any BMI and have a problem. I think the way the other person said to bring it up is great though. That you have noticed her slipping back in to old patterns/behaviors and you're concerned. When you approach her about this make sure you reassure her you're coming from a loving place."

mentalillness,fluesnl,t3_fr7l8x,1585501169.0,"I tried to force myself to be very social when I was younger (middle/high school) and even in my early college years. I was always drained in everyway possible after going out. Having a lot of friends was stressful, dramatic and uncomfortable. I didn't like it, but that's what other people my age were doing, so I thought I had to too. It took me a long time to figure out where I really wanted to be and what I really wanted to do. After getting out of a very toxic and mentally abusive relationship I finally did what I wanted to do. That lead up to me meeting my now husband and he's the same. He doesn't like going out, he doesn't like socializing with a lot of people and us having one another seems to be all we need. I'm more talkative than he is so it's good for me to socialize at work, but he loves just staying home and being alone or with me. I don't think there's anything wrong with wanting that. Not everyone is meant to be super social. If your sister is planning a party see when it's going to happen and find a place you can go to. There's a huge park in my city that definitely brings solitude even on beautiful days when there are a lot of people out. Start planning where you could go. And when the time comes bring some music, headphones, a book or anything else you like to do. It's hard when you're different than your peers, but it's good that you recognize what does make you uncomfortable. And if you need it reach out and I'd love to help you out!"

SuicideWatch,fk18slw,t1_fk07t61,1583774728.0,"I don't think you should outright say ""you're the only reason why I wouldn't kill myself"" but I think letting him know how much you trust him to tell him what's going on. Feeling suicidal is so scary and isolating. Having a person you trust to talk to about it can be helpful, it can help relieve those overwhelming feelings to actually hurt yourself. It gives you time to process and then see another point of view. I think opening up to him could be a good thing, but yes be mindful of how you word things. ""I trust you and care about you a lot and I want to tell you something scary that's been happening to me..."" Something like that. And be as open as you're comfortable with. Don't push yourself to tell him everything at once but also don't sensor yourself for the fear of being a ""burden"".

Life hasn't been the easiest for us, but every moment of struggle and pain is worth it if I have him. I hope at some point I'll start wanting to be alive for more reasons, but it's hard being in my own head. So just think about your boyfriend, maybe even share what you're feeling with him.

We narrowed it down to it being periods of ""free thinking"" that would lead my mind down that path. Some how it's slowly decreased? We have looked at possible triggers as well and worked on how to handle them. At the time this was going on my therapist and I try to process some trauma I had experienced which was too much for me.

We both are each other's best friends and don't want to have a huge social circle, but we are trying to find people who are comfortable in silence or just doing your own thing in the company of others. I find it very difficult to make friends just because I don't socialize easily. I'm usually very quiet until I open up to you. Are you all both from Louisville? My husband might be interested in the trivia thing. We don't drink but it would be fun. Does it cost anything?"
