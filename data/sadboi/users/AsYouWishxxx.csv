ptsd,fqpda49,t3_gjxcmv,1589543237.0,"I've been having trouble with my short term memory recently, and I have also noticed that I can't recall older memories as easily as I used to. My trauma is old news for me but it seems like since I addressed it and started trying to ""validate it"" (according to my therapist), it seems like everything has gotten way worse."
ptsd,fpgc193,t1_fp8lv2u,1588599528.0,"ðŸ˜” I've told him before. Almost all of my coworkers know to some extent what I went through and they see every day that I'm still struggling with it. Nobody else messes with me like that and I don't see this person doing the same thing to anyone else. I'm going to approach him about it if he does it again, it's just never a good time to pull him aside and let him know because work gets so busy that it's one there's never time for that sort of thing. Everyone says to leave personal stuff at home and be professional but that's really hard when everyone I work with reminds me of the person that fucked me up so bad in the first place."
ptsd,foqgmzz,t1_foq3li2,1587993108.0,"EDMR was so strange for me but it seemed to work at least for a bit. I also did CPT for a while but that was more along the ""worse before better"" road which can be rough if you dont keep it up"
adultsurvivors,foqgdtv,t3_g8ix2c,1587992935.0,I know exactly how you feel. I find myself switching between acting more and less mature than my age constantly. Some days people will say I act years beyond my age and other days it's like I'm one wrong move from an actual tantrum. All I've been able to do about it is find people that don't mind and accept both sides of me.

ptsd,fo8ly6z,t3_g63id4,1587599155.0,I have the same thing. I just stopped allowing myself to let time off really feel like time off since I know it's going to end and I'm just going to have all the same shit as before

sex,fniijy2,t3_g1qs5n,1586980602.0,I know how you feel. Sometimes it feels like my sex drive is too much for my husband and he gets tired of me constantly wanting to do stuff
adultery,fmrbdvh,t3_fwj53z,1586318490.0,"I get the same way, especially when my husband and I are apart for long periods of time. I find myself wanting that new attraction and all the attention I can get from a guy that is only just starting to get to know me. I like the new eyes on my body and the different ways men can treat me. We're in one of those long stretches right now and it's taking every ounce if strength not to just go get some. I've tried having the conditional open relationship conversation but he's just not here for it."
