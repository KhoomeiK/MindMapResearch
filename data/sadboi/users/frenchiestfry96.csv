Another good example is during the night where I have severe nightmares of shadow spirits or people watching me through the windows. I even stole an axe to protect myself from them from my parents when was undiagnosed. At this point in the episode I have to keep the windows covered, usually with thick curtains, but it can sometimes be blankets too. Anything to let ""them"" not see me.

shrimptank,fji9htj,t1_fjewq5f,1583362925.0,"(I may be late to this I'm sorry) Although I like the natural cuttlebone and shell options of increasing KH and GH, it's hard to use them to get the specific amounts you want. I originally bought shrimp not realizing KH and GH was an issue. Well a ton of dead shrimp I learned that I need to keep these numbers pretty much exact.

Being a bio major I researched the best way to do this and to measure these systems to keep them as steady as possible.

I decided to buy the seachem neutral regulator and seachem equilibrium. The first fixes your KH and PH to a neutral range, while the latter raises your GH. There are products out there that raise both together but since my tap has differing values for these, it's best to raise them separately.

Now cherry shrimp are best around GH 6-8 and a KH OF 3-15 . I have a ten gallon, so I only add about 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon and then test with my drip kit until I get to my optimal levels. The total amount of teaspoons should be written down (for example, 2 teaspons for KH) so know the number to add to my water change next time. These levels may drop a little until the next water change but it's more stable than adding shells or cuttlefish. 

Important note, if your shrimps are living okay in your current parameters, THEN SLOWLY DECREASE per water change. You'll put them into shock if you lower the KH all of  a sudden."

I'm sorry I'm not replying to all you guys. I did, in fact, read a lot of the replies and they really helped me feel motivated this morning to crack down. I didn't think so many people would be posting their struggles and be so kind to me!

I have been struggling outside MCAT studying due bad family circumstances and even worst financial burdens.

Yes, I'm look for fee assistance, and yes, I will be trying to get accommodations for the test. But, to the people who are in the same boat as me: We matter just as much as the kids who aren't struggling. Our disorders, our burdens, our baggage, can help shape us into the physicians we want to be. I'm here because I want to help people and my love of medicine keeps me going. I hope that, no matter how hard the struggle, it is the same for you.

I have printed out a lot of your comments and DMS and posted them up above my desk to keep me motivated when I feel like theres nowhere else to go.

shrimptank,ffrvo7h,t1_ffrsxm3,1580166896.0,"Sorry once again, I'm new to this all so I dont mean to offend you. 

I definitely agree with you on the ammonia levels being high. I would probably estimate they were in about 1-2 ppm, since after 2 days of ammo lock, they would come to level. However, after adding the ammo lock the test would jump to a shock 8 ppm. That's why I bought the safe chem test that sits in the tank 24/7 which was more accurately depicting what was going on when I added the ammo lock. 

I was told by some fish people that I may want to remove the almond leaf until my ph steadies as its prone to lower ph. I just grouped the almond leaf in with the dead plant litter just to save some explaining while writing. 

I'm  not too worried about the algae since the shrimp love to eat it right now, and its helped me under fed them through out this week. 

Ph is 7 since adding the carbonate buffer solution. However, it will drop slightly to 6.0-6.6 and before adding the buffer was well around 6.0 the whole time

I get an ammonia reading with the drip kit as 4 ppm but the seachem tester says 0.05 ppm; definitely not perfect but not as alarming as the drip kit. I added ammo lock about 2 days ago. 

GH: 6

Kh: 7

I originally thought that the tank didnt fully cycle because of the alarming spike, but I never saw a rise in nitrite or nitrate. My log says nitrates rose to 0.25 ppm for two days while nitrite stayed 0 the whole week. For today both are testing as 0. 

Temp has been around 70-78 °F this whole time. 

Besides the algae bloom, The water has now cleared up and the smell has gone away which is good to see."
shrimptank,ffrs5i5,t1_ffroa4a,1580164617.0,"Yes! Thank you for wondering! I've started adding shrimp minerals and carbonate as well as the primer conditioner to the water during the daily water change. I've also read up that the charcoal isnt necessary but that was after I bought it. I can easily take it out, but I'm worried that theres some bacteria growth on it which will mess with my system further (which is what I'm trying to prevent lol). 

I'll keep an eye out on the molting of the remaining shrimp, I've seen no white ring of death so far, but I won't cross it off on my list to look out for."
shrimptank,ffrrpqt,t1_ffrmg3p,1580164340.0,"Sorry, it sounded like I was blaming him, but I didn't mean to come across like that.  It could've also been me overfeeding that caused the issues as well. My GH is a 4 (GH was a 6 before now) while KH is now at a 6.  I wouldn't really know how my KH would reach 0-1 but the minute I put a drop of KH testing solution in, the water quickly turned the indicators color.

My tap water:

GH: 1 
KH: 3 
Ammonia:  0.50 ppm

My tank is a 10 gallon and was cycled, with plants, for a month. I then purchased 4 cherries to start off with. They seemed happy and content and everything was going well. I then purchased two amanos and two sakura orange. All of them seemed healthy and were going along fine, though a bit lethargic. I put the leaf in and a couple days later one of the orange sakura died. I stupidly had bought some more  shrimp (which I forgot to mention) a couple days later thinking it was an old shrimp and kept the leaf litter in. The next day all three newly purchased neos died, plus the other orange sakura. The rest of the living shrimp and snails were huddled at the top of the tank near my filter inlet. On top of this, the water was cloudy and there was noticeable stench to it. That day I bought the KH and GH kit, got those numbers, and immediately bought some buffering carbonate, ammo lock, a bottle of tetra safe start, and the seachem testers. Did a 50% water change, took out any dying plant matter (including the leaf) and hoped for the best. One of the cherries died, but the rest seemed to be okay.

When I had the 8 shrimp, I was using ammo lock about once a week since the water parameters were coming back with a small amount of ammonia. When all of this started to occur I wouldn't go off the ammonia levels in my tank with the drip tester because it would come back extremely high. Nitrites and nitrates seemed to be 0, even to this day, which is strange to me. 

Now I've been checking the water parameters daily, doing a 30 % water change with my tap water which has a mixture of shrimp minerals, water conditioner, and buffer and is left to sit for a day. The remaining shrimp are doing okay,but are still kind of lethargic. They have stopped hanging around the top of the tank, though, and are grazing on the massive amount of algae that grew during the ammonia spike.  


Sorry if this was a long read! I've assumed it was old tank syndrome and stopped buying shrimp until my water has completely calmed down."
shrimptank,ffrl7p4,t1_ffrkhhc,1580160326.0,"Yes I had 8 shrimp and 3 snails. Now I'm down to 5 shrimp with the original snails. I'm using the API drip test kit. My partner got me almond leaves and, because hes more experienced in the aquarium world, I trusted him. I think the tannins and the fact that it was left in the tank (thus left to rot) started the problem, then when the shrimp started dying, everything got messed up. 

Now I'm just waiting for my bacteria to recover back up."

IdiotsInCars,fdfglgv,t1_fdfb70c,1578361216.0,"kenya learner driver handbook - NTSA: 

(Pg. 8)
""Give right-of-way for specific vehicles, road users or in specific 
situations such as
• Police cars with siren on
• Emergency vehicles such as fire engines and ambulances sounding 
the siren or with flashing lights
• The presidential motorcade
• When asked to do so by a police officer or traffic Marshall""

(Doesn't state that light vehicles have to give buses the right-of-way, which you stated the car should have) 

Pg. 12 shows the types of traffic lines and what they mean. The bus drive was legal at first, since the lines were white and broken, stating he could move into the left lane. However, he continues to try to overtake when theres a yellow line (illegal) and then drive in the channelizing island, which is illegal, unless there is an emergancy (which this would not be considered an emergancy). 

Official Kenyan highway code:

(Pg. 59)

""128.Double white lines where the line nearest to you is broken. This means you may cross 
the lines to overtake if it is safe, provided you can complete the manoeuvre before 
reaching a solid white line on your side. White direction arrows on the road indicate 
that you need to get back onto your side of the road.""

(This indicates that the bus driver INITIALLY had the right of way) 

""130.Areas of white diagonal stripes or chevrons painted on the road. These are to separate 
traffic lanes or to protect traffic turning right.
• If the area is bordered by a broken white line, you should not enter the area 
unless it is necessary and you can see that it is safe to do so.
 • If the area is marked with chevrons and bordered by solid white lines you MUST 
NOT enter it except in an emergency.""

(Like I said previously,  the bus then did not have the authority to go through the marked off yellow area) 

(Pg. 74) 

""65.You MUST NOT overtake
• if you would have to cross or straddle double white lines with a solid line 
nearest to you (but see Rule 129)""

(Literally what the bus did)

(Pg. 75) 

""168.Being overtaken. If a driver is trying to overtake you, maintain a steady course and 
speed, slowing down if necessary to let the vehicle pass. Never obstruct drivers who 
wish to pass. Speeding up or driving unpredictably while someone is overtaking you is  dangerous. Drop back to maintain a two-second gap if someone overtakes and pulls 
into the gap in front of you.""

(The driver in the left lane did not speed up and kept a steady pace, which means the bus is at fault here)

Just because it is a bus doesn't mean that have special rules. The driver should have been thinking and drive consciously. 

Now onto you, don't be pretentious, ecspecially when you say ""search it up"" but you don't follow your own rule. If you're wanting to argue over the internet, be prepared with facts and research. Any person who is legally able to drive would know that the bus person is in the wrong. Ironically, you're making fun of Americans and their close-mindedness, but, in fact, you came out as the ignorant one. You're indirectly saying that Africa would have crazy illegal rules and regulations and would allow A GIANT BUS TO ILLEGALLY OVERTAKE AND RISK MULTIPLE LIVES because they don't follow basic road rules. Road lines are similar, no matter what country you are in; they're easy to follow  and understand every where. 

Follow your own advice next time my dude."

I guess acknowledge and validate your children's feelings when you argue or they came out of an argument with Nparent. Just having someone that says ""yes, I get how you're feeling"" or agreeing that the Nparent was out of control really is refreshing. Gaslighting is a really difficult thing and can do a lot of psychological damage when it happens consistently.

Secondly, talk with an affirmative, but calm demeanor.  Really loud, sudden noises and yelling really gives me extreme anxiety (I panic when a balloon pops) because my Nparent would yell at us and throw things at us to show he was the dominant power.  You don't  have to be submissive in order to be calm and you're children will appreciate the non-chaos you bring. 

In the end, a cool, calm, and collective personality will really go a long way. I would have loved that as a child, and you giving that to them would strengthen your bond and gain their trust ❤"
BipolarReddit,fbkja2s,t1_fbjr4m8,1576951248.0,"I'm extremely straight, but when I'm hypersexual I tend to wanna sleep with any consenting adult. I think it's just me wanting sexual gratification over wanting to be with women. Stable me has trouble being attracted to anything feminine, but if it wants to sleep with me when I'm manic then why the hell not....

It's also important to note that the idea of sex for me completely changes. I have problems attaching with people, so I really struggle with one-night stands and emotionless sex when I'm stable. However, when I'm  manic it's much easier to pull the emotions out of it and just do it to get it over with, if it means I get gratification sexually. 

I've worked with my therapist to control this, so most of the time I dont do anything serious, but the thoughts are there and if I really fly off the handle I could see myself doing it."

BipolarReddit,fb5zayg,t1_fb34lgf,1576537531.0,"A did a little digging and it's  actually a thing. Although it's not as severe as schizophrenia, there are disabilities in both cognitive and executive functioning found in bipolar disorder. Studies also state that these symptoms, although albeit become more severe, occur without a mood episode present, meaning even when we're stable it's  an issue. 

So I guess we can blame it on the disorder a little bit and not because we're lazy lol
