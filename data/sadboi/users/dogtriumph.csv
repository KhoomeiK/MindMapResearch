Knowing the basics, such as how to be safe and not putting other people in risk, is quite enough. More than that, we will go crazy. Let's put datas and stuff like that on the hands of the authorities and scientists, our job is just to avoid being infected and avoid spreading.

Also, about Lexapro... I know it can trigger mania etc. but I'm willing to try it (only after I start lithium, to avoid triggering mania) because my anxiety is killing me and I've read a lot of positive stuff about Lexapro being very effective against GAD and panic attacks. So... yeah, I'm optimistic. I've been dealing without constant medication for more than 3 years and wow, I feel both a hero for surviving this far all by myself and also very stupid because I suffered a lot instead of just accepting that I'm bipolar and that I need meds, it could have spared me a lot of trouble with anxiety... and money. lol"
