It was a selfie I took right after I got home from my junior homecoming, and it was my favorite picture of myself. I just thought it was really nice and for once, for once, I liked looking at a photo of myself. I struggled with a lot of anxiety and self esteem issues in the past, and at that point I thought I was pretty most of the time in the mirror, but I hated pictures of myself. It was just nice to feel bomb af, and it was a good confidence booster to see this picture where I looked cute as hell every time I looked at my phone! I remember even asking my friend if it would be egotistical or something, but decided, ah, fuck it. Who cares? It makes me feel good, and itâ€™s not hurting anyone.

Plus, even if someone hasnâ€™t struggled with self esteem or whatever, sometimes itâ€™s still just nice. It still feels good to be able to appreciate how you look, and thereâ€™s nothing wrong with that, yâ€™know?"

mentalhealth,f57nta4,t1_f57bwrx,1572040107.0,"Thanks:)

Iâ€™m so sorry to hear about that situation. I am by no means a professional (Iâ€™m a senior in high school right now), so I canâ€™t say that any advice I give will be the best, but if her and your daughter are/become pretty close, you can always offer to be a shoulder for her and let her know that if she needs help, she can come to you (especially if her home life isnâ€™t good). She might not be comfortable talking to school counselors, and if you talk to them, I think theyâ€™re required to tell her parents if sheâ€™s a danger to herself. Depending on her home life, this could be a good thing or a bad thing. 

I think encouraging her to go to a counselor would be a good step to take, as well as somehow letting her know that she can come to you if she needs help (if you feel that youâ€™re in a position where youâ€™re okay with that). Aside from that, Iâ€™d be in the same position as you in not knowing how to handle the situation. I honestly have no idea whether or not you should just go to the counselors yourself or anything else.

Iâ€™m sorry. I hope this helped at least a little bit, and I hope your daughterâ€™s friend gets help. I know this is a tough situation, but itâ€™s great of you to really try to help the girl the way you want to, even if youâ€™re not exactly sure how. Maybe speaking with a professional might help?"
