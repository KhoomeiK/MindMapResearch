But today this may be changing, because modern technology is developing ways of modifying human beings.145. Imagine a society that subjects people to conditions that make them terribly unhappy, then gives them drugs to take away their unhappiness. Science fiction? It is already happening to some extent in our own society. It is well known that the rate of clinical depression has been greatly increasing in recent decades. We believe that this is due to disruption of the power process, as explained in paragraphs 59-76. But even if we are wrong, the in-creasing rate of depression is certainly the result of SOME conditions that exist in todayâ€™s society. Instead of removing the conditions that make people depressed, modern society gives them antidepressant drugs. In effect, antidepressants are a means of modifying an individualâ€™s internal state in such a way as to enable him to tolerate social conditions that he would otherwise find intolerable.
