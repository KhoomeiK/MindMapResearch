SuicideWatch,fcpzb7s,t3_eieayu,1577875381.0,"Very much so. I dont know if it's wrong to say this, but I'm thankful I'm not entirely alone in this feeling, because I really deeply feel alone otherwise. I've been feeling so alone and useless, unwanted and disliked, and just all around ""other"". I'm not happy and I feel like I cant make others happy no matter what I do. I hope everyone feels better and that everyone here can find healing and happiness. I wish I could be at a state in life where I'm not begging god to kill me in a way that doesnt hurt anyone else."
