Up until that line, I was thinking sure, of course it's fine for him to hang out with girls and you to hang out with guys.

But that line jumps out at me as the real problem here.

What is he secretive about? You need to tell him that you perceive him as secretive, and tell him that you need more openness and transparency from him to feel comfortable and secure in your relationship. Tackle that issue first and foremost.

Your boyfriend is his own individual person, he can and will hang out with whoever he wants. You need to get comfortable with that if you want a healthy relationship not based on possession and ownership. Jealousy is a normal and valid response to him hanging out with girls, but the solution isn't to ban him from doing so, the solution is to look within yourself and work on your triggers so you can resolve your jealousy issues. Which is a lot of work, and takes a while, but it's something you need to do in order to maintain healthy relationships.

If your partner is trustworthy, this process is a lot easier because each time they hang out with other people, and nothing bad happens, the threat begins to fade and feel okay."
relationships,f14ns9z,t3_d7uht0,1569178045.0,"First you need to figure out if you actually mind driving to his place to hang out. Scrap the societally coded message of ""evenness"" and ""fairness"" and figure out if it actually bothers you to drive to his house to spend time with him there.

If you determine that it DOES bother you, you've got to communicate it to him very clearly, and tell him what you specifically need to feel happier in your arrangement.

I also wonder if you could have the need to feel like he's pulling his weight and putting in his share of effort in other ways? If you can't come to an agreement about this specific situation of you driving to his versus him picking you up, can you talk to him about other ways he might be able to show that he's invested and wants to put in effort into you?

Another thing you said was that he'll pick you up for dates but prefers you to drive if you're hanging out at his. Maybe a point to consider is that if you're driving there, his end of the ""contributing"" is the house itself, where you two get alone time away from parents.

These are all just my initial thoughts. You're allowed to want to feel more reciprocation from him, but I just thought I'd try to encourage you to maybe think about it in another way- removed from the idea of tit for tat/keeping score."
