Perempuan,fm1iklp,t3_frsg7c,1585679076.0,"Kepada kamu yang nanya tubuh normal itu keliatannya seperti apa...
Untuk ukuran standar orang indo, badanku bisa dibilang ga kecil dan jujur susah banget wey nyari baju di indo padahal ga gendut-gendut amat sih.
Tapi untuk standar orang luar, semua pada bilang aku kecil, ya karena emang mereka pada tinggi semua sih hahah. Setelah tinggal cukup lama di luar, jadi ngeliat badan orang ternyata beragam. Ada yang upper bodynya besar, lower bodynya kecil atau sebaliknya. Bahkan orang yang keliatannya proposional pun kalo duduk ada lipetan perutnya.

Intinya, natural banget kalo punya lipetan perut. It's ok! Dan standar bentuk badan tuh beda-beda. Don't be so hard on yourself! tapi menurutku yang paling penting adalah kamu nyaman dengan apa yang kamu pake, kalo kamu nyaman, otomatis kamu bakal pede!"

The other creepy men are mostly above 40 year old men."
Perempuan,flbecp1,t3_flp10k,1585002894.0,"I've went on a lot of dates and I've met some assholes. For the record, i don't live in ID at the moment.
Date Nr. 4: it was already late and we met quite far from where i live, he agreed to drive me back home later. We went to his flat, made out and he suddenly pushed my head to his crotch out of nowhere and i tried to push my head back away from his crotch. He didn't stop pushing until i slapped his hand and he said ""i thought you like it rough""
I never reached him back. 
Of course i don't report him because i don't want to get asked ""why did you agree to go to his flat in the first place?"" 

Date Nr. 11: suddenly grinded his hard dick on my jeans although i didn't show any interest in him earlier on the date. He also joked that i have Corona (because i'm asian and i had flu) when he invited me again to his flat and i said no cause i was sick. Instant block. 

Date Nr. 17: he kissed me at the end of the date and said to me ""i know you want to take this somewhere and have sex right away if you could"" then he ""trumped"" me (tapped me on my lady part). I confronted him and he laughed cause he found it funny. We went to women's march together that day. I'd never ever want to see that bastard's face ever again. 

I honestly don't know how to cope. I realise the older i become, the worse it gets. I was 10, the first time someone catcalled me. A guy stalked me, another guy groped my legs, a group of 40-ish old men was staring in pervy way at my bare legs just because i wore short skirt. It was in the summer and hot as fuck.

Hope those bastards deserve the karma."

AsianBeauty,etqirf9,t1_etqhobg,1563086826.0,"i used to have cosrx aha couple months ago. i was looking the dupe for The Ordinary Glycolic Acid Toning Solution then i found cosrx.

despite the instruction says use it once - three times a week, i was a rebel and i use it **everyday after toner**. surprisingly, it didn't turn bad at all! i had the clearest skin in years *(ok maybe exaggerating)* but it faded my PIH and made my skin tone more even. i was really satisfied with cosrx aha 7 and i'm planning to repurchase the product.

after i used cosrx, i thought i was free from PIH until i used wrong face mask that caused me acne and PIH. i wanted to try something new and decided not to buy cosrx aha 7. so i bought **TO Glycolic Acid Toning Solution**. i was happy that i finally got it because that's the product i've wanted to buy in the first place. i've been using it since April and i'm not a rebel anymore so i use it *only* at night and in the morning i use **Benton Aloe BHA Skin Toner** (the green one). i really notice than Benton is gentler than TO. 

I have to say, i don't get the same result from The Ordinary like i did from cosrx after using it for few months. it could be that i didn't use TO the way i used cosrx but i don't want to force it cause i could feel the toner is milder than cosrx"

If you want to pick up new words, i'd say reading newspaper is the best way since you will read longer text than B1-B2 level. You'll learn ""sophisticated"" words from newspapers.

For listening, you can try listen to podcast from newspapers (SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung has it), they'll talk about latest trends. Honestly, i did learn some listening from watching Tatort from das Erste haha. They have subtitle/Untertitel which can be helpful. Hope you can pass your TestDaf!"
