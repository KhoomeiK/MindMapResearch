hireanartist,f9tesyh,t3_e4nif7,1575620467.0,Think you could make a concept for a moth character. The design would have to be transferable to an armature which is like a stop motion puppet.

TBI,f7q9xrf,t3_dpwwru,1573960868.0,"Yes, sheâ€™s in Chicago itâ€™s called mind eye connection, if that canâ€™t help you substantially than youâ€™ll just have to wait for more futuristic stuff. But this lady Deborah zelinsky is brilliant and in her own league, she gets it. she gets it. Sheâ€™s the only one who gets it but sheâ€™s alone. Iâ€™m not gunna go into detail but if your seeking help for your head than I say her. Youâ€™ll see that some of the stuff she does is like literal magic tricks. She will put different types of lenses in front of your eye and with your eyes closed sheâ€™ll ask you to touch a bell she rings by you head only by hearing it, easier said than done but then sheâ€™ll put different lenses in front of your eyes until you can touch the bell in one try, and your eyes donâ€™t even have to be open. And then she can put a lense in front of someone without a tbi and it will simulate what YOUR TBI is like to you. She did that to my mom and my mom just broke down crying and said she never realized. Iâ€™m sure a lot of that doesnâ€™t make sense but I hope it gives you hope."

TBI,f5zt2ju,t3_dpwwru,1572586552.0,"Iâ€™d love to experience the click. Iâ€™ve heard it be described as feeling as tho someone is behind you and as time progresses that feeling slowly gets closer until it connects with you and you realize it was you the whole time, behind yourself in some way. Iâ€™ve gotten special glasses to experience the click after a book called ghost in my brain where a very intelligent professor had a severe tbi for ten years before he got the glasses and experienced the click. Anyway Iâ€™m happy for you, I really am. I wouldnâ€™t wish the torture of tbi on my worst enemy. I hope I can get that click even if it occurred while I was on my death bed."

I know what itâ€™s like to have an addicted loved one. It will be a long and excruciating road before you realise that there is absolutely nothing you can do. It will come when youâ€™re exhausted, heartbroken, and when you feel the pain of their self-destruction pressing relentlessly and permanently against you. The relationships and the world around you will start to break, and youâ€™ll cut yourself on the jagged pieces.  Thatâ€™s when youâ€™ll know, from the deepest and purest part of you, that you just canâ€™t live like this any more.

It only end with Letting go, that probably seems like the hardest thing to do but for you itâ€™s true.  look at yourself from your dads perspective if he knew how he was affecting you he would feel terrible, he wants you to be happy. Youâ€™ll be a stronger person for all your struggles"
