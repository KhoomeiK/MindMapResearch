bipolar,fnzz822,t3_g4ws7e,1587403310.0,I just got out of a major depressive episode. I couldn't go to work I barely could get out of bed. My wife had to control my meds so I wouldn't try to OD and I couldn't drive because I thought about crashing constantly. I'm returning to work today but still am stressed about having to work. I'd say I feel 90% better.

atheism,f1pwfp4,t3_daicrc,1569689258.0,It makes people feel good having a personal god. Something to confide in. I don't think all humans will be able to abandon that sense of safety and optimism about death. Personally thinking that someone or something ceases to exist after death shakes me. I can't think about death for long without becoming severely depressed but then again I am bipolar and it could just be a trigger.
bipolar,f1mvaxr,t3_da31hv,1569602906.0,Dude I stopped smoking and it literally helps me so much now that I'm not high. Like our brains are already deficient in these happy chemicals and as soon as you smoke those chemicals go through the roof and then when you lose the high they crash which makes things way worse. You may need to play around with your meds. I used to feel like that often but lately I am a lot better I'm on lithium Seroquel and latuda phasing out Seroquel and I feel great
