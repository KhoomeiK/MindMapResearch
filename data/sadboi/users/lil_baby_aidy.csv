AskReddit,fpxdj2u,t3_gfsi0q,1588980561.0,"My family is relatively poor, and I didn't have a room like my sisters, so I slept on the couch every night in the living room, right next to the front door. We have a very sweet cat who usually slept on the couch with me.

One night I'm not asleep yet and my cat gets up and stares at the door. I didn't think anything of it until she started to howl at the door. I've heard my cat hiss, but never *howl* like that. It was incredibly loud and bone-chilling, not because of the cat herself, but because I knew something had to be behind that door to have my cat shriek like this.

This went on for a while as I just stared at the door. Probably after about 15-20 minutes of my cat shrieking in intervals, she stopped. I managed to calm down. The doors were locked and it was probably just another animal.

Then it started happening every night for about 4-5 days. Every time it terrified me. We didn't have a window that could see the porch and I obviously wasn't going to open the door to check.

Then one night as my cat is howling and I'm frozen still on the couch watching the door, something started to slam into it, over and over again. I thought the door was gonna break off it's hinges. I shot up and had a coffee mug ready as a weapon. It eventually stopped and left.

While I was convinced it was a murderer, turns out later it was a bobcat. Still incredibly scary, but at the time brought quite a lot of relief."
