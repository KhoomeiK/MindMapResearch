selfharm,f1wp5yx,t3_dauoly,1569787731.0,"i'd recommend staying off this subreddit and other platforms that might remind you of sh if you worry that it might trigger you. 

another trick i got from someone on reddit: when you relapse, don't start counting from 0 again. instead just keep counting from where you left off and add the amount of relapses. for example: clean for 4months with only 2 small relapses. thinking in an optimistic way is really helpful when recovering.

wishing you the best of luck! :) you can do it ‚ù§"

selfharm,evojq5d,t1_evnw5re,1564648434.0,"yes it's definitely unfair for OP, but please don't underestimate the hoarder's pain. 
having something thrown away feels like you somehow lost control over your life, and that your life is now over. i know these aren't reasonable thoughts at all, and i'm sure their mom does too. but it's something they first need to recover from before you can just throw their stuff away.
 but i definitely agree with you that it's incredibly selfish of their mother to let them suffer with her."
