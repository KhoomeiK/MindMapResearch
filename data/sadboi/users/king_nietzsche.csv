They isolate they do drugs and drink and either they start a company and become everyones boss or they self implode and fall off the face of the earth because they wpuld rather isolate themselves and be lonely than live in a society full of simple ass petty people. So im sure the feeling is mutual on mannys part. His character is wince worthy alot of the time tho. Intellectualism is an island.
