Listen, I've tried suicide 21 times last year. One of the attempts actually almost took me, but in the last few seconds, I've realised that what I'm doing really isn't worth it. I can push on, despite my (former) severe depression, anxiety, and overwhelming suicidal thoughts. And here I am now, in a significantly better mental state, trying my best to talk some sense into you.

Trust me on this; if I can do it, there's no reason you shouldn't be able to. After all, it is the pain and bullshit that you want to end. Not your life."
