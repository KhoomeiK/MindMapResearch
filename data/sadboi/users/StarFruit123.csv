I saw the show with all the original cast, however Troy Iwata was playing Rich."
bemorechill,fq19feg,t1_fq10ytr,1589043509.0,"That is a different opinion, for sure. I honestly don't know if it was just that I didn't see a great performance, or that my seats were bad, but I didn't enjoy the Broadway one as much as I would like to admit. I saw it closing week. August 4th, 2019. I was so excited, but in the end, I was super underwhelmed. Jeremy seemed uninterested in the show, Christine had an annoying voice, and The Squip sounded like a surfer dude. Michael was okay, I guess, but it couldn't fix the show. As you can imagine, I was disappointed. The only character that was good in this show, from my perspective, was Rich, who was played by Troy Iwata. His performance was phenomenal. I loved his riffs in ""The Squip Song"". I watched the Off-Broadway boot last night, and wow! I loved it. Will Roland actually sounded like he gave a crap in this version of the show, Jason Tam's voice sounded great, and all the actors did a really good job. 

Be More Chill is my favorite show, and it was really unfortunate that I didn't enjoy the version of it on Broadway. I did get to meet George Salazar and Troy Iwata, so that was a plus.

How were the props in London digital? Iirc, they used a screen in the Broadway production as well."
