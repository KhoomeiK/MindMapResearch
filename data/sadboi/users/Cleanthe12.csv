BPD,fb8869x,t1_fb2arxr,1576608245.0,"In France a lot of qualified therapists and psychiatrists do not want to give you a diagnosis. They hate/refuse to give diagnosis of personality disorders . They don’t know enough about it ( despite being fully qualified) and just want to treat the symptoms ( e.g anxiety, eating disorder) but they do not want to put the « label ». Even if they know/ think BPD is the most appropriate diagnosis they won’t tell you. They keep it to themselves saying that patients do not need to know. It’s a shame .  People can follow a therapy and never know that their psychiatrist think they are BPD. I know that because I have a lot of friends who are psychiatrists or psychologists/ I work in the medical field myself. So you should know there are thousand of people out there who are in therapy/ have a therapist but no diagnosis . I don’t like the not knowing either ..."
BPD,fazc7uh,t1_fave78f,1576414641.0,"Sorry I was not very clear...I don’t imply that the “true religion” wouldn’t have done what it did to you. There is no “true” religion. All religions ( even worse for cults because Mormonism is a cult for us in Europe) have been corrupted, your conman was inspired by religions and invented a new corrupted one only to help himself I completely agree.  What I mean is that behind all of those interpretations/ corrupted perverted dogmas there is a universal truth there is a “god” or a field of cosmic energy or whatever you want to call that . Unfortunately the interpretation is left to bad controlling people who turned into cult leaders or religious leaders. We should try to show that to those poor brainwashed followers, without destroying or hating the idea of universal good and the idea of god / whatever you want to call it. What I meant is that I hated all religions . Yes most of the time they are brainwashing peoples. But I am not atheist. I don’t think there is one good religion either, there is none, all of them are corrupted. But still people shouldn’t be blamed to be on a spiritual journey because the core of universal spirituality is there even if we don’t have access to it. We should make them see they are brainwashed without rejecting the idea of god or universal good or spirituality . We cannot tell them they are wrong and there is nothing because it might be very untrue. I don’t know if that makes any sense to you... Religions are all bad in practices. God/ spiritual journey/ universal values of good and bad do exist though ."
BPD,faupeg5,t1_fata8ti,1576350718.0,"I kind of had the same dilemma... Maybe you should dissociate religion, the universal and pure message conveyed by all religions, the original/ untouched sacred texts( that are actually very similar at their core) and the religious dogmas/ the sacred texts that have been rewritten by the priests/ the ruling classes/ the cult leaders ...The core of religion/ spirituality is pure universal good . But most of the time, religions dogmas and their leaders have changed/rewritten/interpreted it in a different way for their benefit, in order to control and manipulate people . That is why you should see the polarity/ and the difference : religious dogmas and religious leaders are mostly bad/ manipulating and controlling but religious universal message is good at its core so we cannot say religion is bad... Only religious dogmas and religious leaders are ...

polyamory,f8vwb11,t3_e2hlq4,1574878536.0,"About historic polyamory well it depends on your definition of monogamy ...Because historically, basically people have never ever been sexually or romantically exclusive . Never ever especially ruling classes and especially men . You can safely say that ruling classes and aristocrats in Europe have never been sexually or romantically exclusive . In Greece Socrat had a wife AND a boyfriend . Everybody knew about it . All philosophers had a wife and a boyfriend ... Then throughout history in Europe people were married for practical transactional and financial reasons . But they knew marriage and love were exclusionary. Love and marriage never went hand in hand ...Love couldn’t happen in a marital situation . Love was never for the husband but only for the lover . In the beginning even Catholic Church did not care much about monogamy/ sexual exclusivity, then later they associated with bourgeoisie/ middle class and they pushed their monogamist and sexual fidelity agenda (monogamous people are much easier to control) . To almost no effect on the lower classes and the really upper classes / aristocrats ... So well it really depends on your definition of monogamy . Historically people were married and yes husband and wife were living together (not so much for aristocrats ) sure, but they definitely had not only one sexual or romantic partner neither for a lifetime nor at a time ... It was kind of different than cheating . Everybody knew, they all seem to think it was normal ... For most of history it was like that...I mean, can we really call that « monagamy » then...?"

And they don’t have sex with their « girlfriends » either because they don’t have any they are monogamous you know ... So alas it seems to be a pretty frequent situation ... And they still stay together  even if the men are incredibly frustrated at times ... Some of them have sex every once in a while ( every six months maybe) very sad situations but very very common ... At least you have a sexual life with your girlfriend ! And maybe  it’s just a long phase and you’ll have sex again ..."

You should definitely tell her that at some point you’ll have to meet in person, or you’ll find no interest in pursuing that kind of relationship ... I have no idea why none of you can manage to take a plane and visit the other for a few days but efforts should be made on both sides ... 4 years without meeting in person ever seems terribly long to me ...!"
polyamory,f6wskk3,t3_dti2gs,1573233897.0,"I have a long distance partner as well we’ve been in a relationship for 8 years and I value our relationship deeply ... Indeed you are poly so why would it be a problem ? It’s kind of frustrating at times for sure, but you have to accept reality, both of you can’t move, and you can’t put the blame on anyone really ... But if you really care for that person, you can sustain emotional and sexual connection even long distance ( many ways to connect sexually even long-distance), and when you meet in person those moments are beautiful rare and become cherished memories . Some years we only met twice a year and sometimes it’s quite difficult to wait that long ... But even if we’re far away we still can be « there » for each other in many ways ... We have built a very deep connexion,I feel emotionally intellectually ( and in a way sexually) more connected to him than to some partners who are closer ... So that’s the point and the beauty of being poly : you can have meaningful long-distance relationships as well, don’t you think ? Why would you want to lose that ?

And well I am sorry but casual sex even if different is, on a spectrum, closer to « objectifying » than sexual loving intimate relationships since by definition with casual sex you do not want emotional connection with your partner you do not care ( or significantly less) about your partner as a person ( even if you can respect them and that might be the difference with the objectification but from experience it feels pretty much the same ) you mostly care about their body ...

polyamory,f382o5e,t1_f35i8nj,1570732921.0,"Well it is simple: hunters gatherers hunted for the all tribe... Then agricultural era began. Men work hard for their piece of land and did not want to work for the neighbour’s kids. They had no way to figure out if it was their kids or not ( no dna testing) so men wanted/ needed monogamy very much . But people were cheating and so non-monogamous throughout history despite that . Men much more and much easily than women, but women were  cheating as well... So monogamy never ever existed in its true pure theorical form ... Before the 50’s 60’s marriage was a transactional arrangement most of the time, it had nothing to do with love, love was expected to be found outside of the marriage, with lovers/ love affairs and it was especially true for the upper class . Safe to say basically that ruling class/ aristocracy as a group throughout history from Ancient greece till nowadays never ever really experimented what we call today « monogamy » even if they were indeed « married » till death..."
polyamory,f37v2ki,t1_f35buhi,1570730601.0,"Monogamy was not natural nor unnatural but what you say is denying reality even more... Monogamy ( semi monogamy) was probably the best thing to do given the circumstances and the environnment of those times ( agricultural era no birth control) but it was never true monogamy to begin with, people never really expected sexual or emotional exclusivity i mean yes basically all men cheated and to an extent, women cheated as well ... By the way people almost never married out of love till the 50’s/60’s, before that love and marriage were seen as two completely opposite things and love was only shared with the lover/ never with the wife/husband... So you know monogamy pretty much NEVER existed in its pure form... It existed mainly for practical reasons in history nothing related to love/ pretty much the opposite ...
