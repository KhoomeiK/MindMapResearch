BPD,foamd1k,t3_g61u5j,1587649121.0,"I realised I do better in school and at work whenever I am single. 

And I seem to not able to get both right at the same time. I am not sure if there is a pattern behind. 

It is like when I was in school, I put a lot of energy in my relationship, hence neglecting my homework and grades and even my final year.

When I am working, it was still ok when I am single or in a relationship. But relationship will be the one that kills my work like I will get affected by my partner and then my work will be affected.

Why cant I have both together."
