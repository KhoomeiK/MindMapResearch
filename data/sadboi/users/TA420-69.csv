It's the worst feeling ever, because even on happy days, I still have very little to no interest in doing anything.

You're not alone with the suicidal thoughts either. I've gotten them bad many times. Have yet to find any sort of therapy that actually helps me.

Hang in there. We've made it this far, we can make it even more."

Tell me what you want!"

I do have books I've been holding off on. I'll try and force myself a bit to read. Without forcing it on myself too much. It has to be a really good book for me to stay in it, otherwise I lose interest. I play games, but try not to too much. I'm going to try and find a hobby. Maybe learn how to fix my truck."
leaves,flz0won,t1_flyzqrp,1585613146.0,"The whole reason I started smoking was because of my depression and sleep issues I originally had. I'm ADHD, and sleep is just something that doesn't work for me all the time.

I've had nights where it didn't matter how tired I was, it would take hours to sleep. I'm so tired right now, but can't sleep at all. 

But I'm not going to use that as an excuse to pick up smoking again. I'm sure I'll figure it out eventually. It's just tough, and doesn't help that I'm not getting much support from my friends."

Pills are the dumbest thing you can do. You'll be in more pain with no way out. Do research. Don't be stupid"

Only reason I kept going was because of the money."

We had so many meetings about it, and in the end they did nothing. It doesn't bug me as much as it used to, but it's still there, and honestly I wish I could just repress it and move on. I guess I have a fragile mind."

I sometimes wonder if I was just over reacting and that it wasn't a big deal. But in my head, it's a very big deal and had left me feeling... Not right. It's so very hard to explain."

Someone needs to know, and if your parents are the supportive type, then please tell them. The longer it lingers and stays in your brain without working through the problem, the worse you're just gonna get.

Been there and still do this. Gather your thoughts. Try and stay calm and collective. And have a sit down with Mom and/or dad and talk it over with them.

I hope some of this helps."

I feel like a slave to the system. And that most people who realize it are the ones to tend to be the most depressed. I feel like we might get somewhere if people were able to make more livable wages at these shit jobs, reduce the hours for more free time and mental health time and hire a few extra people so more are working.

At least that's how I feel it should work. But how I feel and reality are different.

The hardest part though is being truthful about it and confident. Hard to be confident and say you have a small penis. Most just laugh."

They tell me it's unhealthy to do that, but what else can I do when nobody will listen?

Sometimes I get in a good mood though and it feels like my depression was really all just attention seeking. But then I get depressed again and fall back into the bad habits."
