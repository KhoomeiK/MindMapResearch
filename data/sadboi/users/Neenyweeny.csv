AnimalCrossingNewLeaf,fp1rkqt,t1_fp1rhhj,1588245627.0,I had wild world on my DS when it first came out! Not sure how long ago that was but was around 2006 I think?
AnimalCrossingNewLeaf,fp1rgk4,t1_fp1rg0j,1588245519.0,"Amazing, let me know when :)"
AnimalCrossingNewLeaf,fp1rdrg,t1_fp1rc1i,1588245446.0,"Ok no problem! :) I’m new so trying to see how people have their towns, am I able to come and visit anyway?"
AnimalCrossingNewLeaf,fp1r7vn,t3_gar7jg,1588245294.0,Hello! Are you still doing this? :) I’ve added you FC: 1461-7451-8202
mentalhealth,fof1cto,t1_foexcjl,1587722414.0,Your mind can block out traumatic experiences as a coping mechanism. It’s actually a really common thing to experience. Just like how people forget details when involved in a crime or car crash etc
costochondritis,fm79wph,t3_ft2gn5,1585818740.0,"I’ve recently had coronavirus mildly and it was fine. The only thing that happened was it caused a flare up from all the coughing, so I would wake up quite sore and with the tightness in my chest too. It was uncomfortable but no worse than someone without costo. Hope this helps!"
costochondritis,fltp8z7,t3_fpz6kg,1585482438.0,I don’t think so! I’ve had very mild corona and been ok. It has caused an awful flare up from the coughing but that’s it
mentalhealth,fl9cyt0,t1_fl93sso,1584950080.0,"Hello! Thank you so much for taking the time to reply! How weird that were so similar. I’m glad that your costo is mostly healed. I’m having a flare up at the minute which is definitely not helping my anxiety! Thanks for the book recommendation, I’ll definitely order it ASAP. I’m having CBT at the minute but with corona they have stopped all of my appointments which sucks. You’re right about meds being a bandaid, I think I was so keen to rip the bandaid off when I posted this because I didn’t want to become reliant and not try to work through the issues with my body. Since the corona outbreak began I’ve definitely postponed wanting to come off my meds as I feel like this would be the worst timing to do it, but hopefully the book will help me get there :) I really appreciate your comment. It can be very lonely having health anxiety but it sounds like we are definitely experiencing the same sort of things!"
HealthAnxiety,fkl8i28,t3_fj6j3t,1584300801.0,I used to get this all the time! I started to take meds and it stopped but they have started to come back with all of the Corona talk. Try taking deep breaths or even holding your breath for 10 seconds.
Sims4,fgln9k0,t1_fgcjfzy,1580905201.0,Amazing thank you!!!

Sims4,fes2fck,t1_fes2cmm,1579360702.0,I’ve just removed my mods and it wasn’t that ☹️ how do I repair the game please?
Sims4,fes10g8,t3_eqhhlr,1579360309.0,My sims seems to be having some sort of malfunction! I’ve turned the laptop on and off again but can’t work out what’s wrong. I have custom content but haven’t added anything for over a month?? When I go on the game all they can think about is the university mascot and the game is completely unplayable ☹️
Sims4,fcxd33c,t3_ej0f7p,1578059664.0,Can you have roommates now even if not in university? :)

glee,f4um3i9,t1_f4udorq,1571817277.0,"This is literally how I feel! I loved seeing Rachel happy and develop a relationship with Sam, but they just put her and Jesse together with no on screen progression which is what I didn’t like!"
BadMUAs,f4sa48x,t3_dl7iaw,1571775860.0,I actually think this looks great!

glee,f4qqow4,t1_f4qqdjf,1571757001.0,"It’s obvious from what I said that I knew he was dead. You’re just pointlessly being arsey behind a keyboard, doesn’t sound like an interesting day to me!!"
glee,f4qq5y8,t1_f4qp9xh,1571756779.0,Do you have nothing better to do hahaha! Also he is more than just a character death?? Literally everyone knows he’s dead because it was a massive news story...

HealthAnxiety,f0m39ky,t1_f0m2fjz,1568735763.0,I agree with Zorukia. I had this when my anxiety got really bad and I ended up going on medication and it’s a lot better. Definitely sounds like dissociation
mentalhealth,ez95dxm,t1_ez8tk2m,1567773484.0,"Great thank you! I actually collect two months just before brexit so feel like it gives some leeway, but just wanted to see if anyone else is concerned!"

costochondritis,exnzd0q,t1_exmfuq1,1566466796.0,"Yep, I quickly learned as my anxiety escalated not too google! Only after self-diagnosing a lot of different conditions and like yourself, starting to see these symptoms in myself. 

Does the chiro help? What do you do there"

HealthAnxiety,ex1knv4,t3_cr0bxs,1565948352.0,"I would maybe go to the doctors to reassure yourself. My health anxiety started when I would get chest pain - mainly on the left side and it feels like a heart attack. I have something called costochondritis which is swelling in the muscle near your ribs, or something like that anyway. It’s completely fine and really common. I would stay awake at night thinking my heart would fail - and although sometimes I still feel like that, going to the doctors and getting a non-serious diagnoses really helped me. The other symptoms, like someone else said, will be your anxiety manifesting. Try and take deep breaths and also try holding your breath for ten seconds to remind yourself that you are in control of your breathing and your heart. Hope this helps!"
