I'm(f) in a hetero relationship but I'm bisexual (not all bi women are threesome machines, don't expect that of us, I just personally wanted it) and my bf of course is down for two women at once.

The first time, my boyfriend and I invited a female friend over that I shared nudes with and we talked about sex a couple of times. We all got high together which ended up being a mistake bc even tho we reassured her that she can say no to anything and whenever she wants, and nothing was expected of her. I don't know where she got confused but she randomly asked in the middle of the threesome if she was being raped, and we stopped everything, had a discussion, and she wanted to continue. My bf and I decided not to jump back on that, we sobered up and I drove her home.

The second time was with a co-worker, she was down for it, but when we started she gave me absolutely no attention. It was me and him and her and him. She didn't tell me not to touch her, but she literally never touched me, I felt neglected and angry. Maybe she's not into women, but she could've said that before we started. I just got absolutely nothing out of that experience and sharing my boyfriend isn't the easiest thing to do in the first place.

On the occasion that she gets out the door or off the leash, yelling RIDE?!?? and carefully following her with the car with a door open is literally the only way to get her to come back. And when we do go for rides she barks at all the cars we pass and whines when we slow down or stop at stop lights. She's such a dork lol"

Surprise surprise, we didn't put two and two together. Me and another of our party touched it, and just felt overwhelming joy, and turned lawful good. I don't remember how but we got it fixed."

AskReddit,ffenyzy,t3_esy81b,1579856625.0,"I met my boyfriend. He was the first person I ever met off of tinder, or any dating app. Almost a year if fwb, and now over a year and a half of official dating. We moved in together last November and are very happy together. I would've never thought that one of my first right swipes would change my life so much for the better."

AskReddit,ff9kun6,t3_esc8vq,1579715130.0,"Assuming that for my 13 year old self it's also January 22nd (2013), then that would be the day the Aunt I'm named after died. We'd just cry together, then I'd buy her a birthday cake because our birthday would be tomorrow. The world is cruel in its irony."
Petioles,ff8k3hv,t3_erz9o2,1579682236.0,"I feel the same way, but I believe it's because of my anxiety. When I'm not high my mind can race a thousand miles an hour overthinking what I or someone had said, things that I did, people's body language, money, my worth. You name it, I'm anxious about it. Not to say that I don't get anxious when I'm high, it still happens, occasionally it makes it worse. But all in all, my mind is generally a lot slower, brighter, and more relaxed when I'm high. Lately I rarely go a day without getting high after work, today being a sober day. Thankfully I'm not doing too bad without it today and I hope you find the ability to be sober and fine."

It's a little bit of a hassle to go pick it up, but probably less annoying than the constant calls and messed up deliveries."
BDSMcommunity,fepxl6t,t3_eqagv4,1579334141.0,"One time after a very rough play session, with drool and tears all over my hair which was also everywhere, my Daddy offered to brush my hair. I accepted and he brushed my hair so gently and held me so tight afterwards.

I also have terrible self esteem, and just a few nights ago my Daddy had me restrained and I had my eyes closed ready for slaps or what have you. He demanded I opened my eyes, and he was right there looking back at me, and proceeded to compliment me and tell me how much he loves me and that I am such a good girl. I felt so happy I almost cried"

BDSMcommunity,fdzz9gt,t3_enbgl2,1578799351.0,"During an impact session my daddy noticed I was getting quiet from the pain/subspace and it was really random from what I can remember, but he asked a question that went like this:

D: what do cows say?
s: what?
D: WHAT DO COWS SAY?!
s: moo???
*cane to the ass*
D: good girl. What do cows say?
s: ...moo..
*cane to the ass*

Went like that for a lil while til he had enough fun, easily very humiliating, kinda put me in a ""little"" mood like he was violently teaching a child animal noises"
