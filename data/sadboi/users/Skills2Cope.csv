60 days is a major accomplishment. And for many of us we start over a hundred times before it sticks. What counts is we keep trying. 

Hang in there."

For legs I did the sit-down machine where the weight is loaded in front and no back strain, also any curb will work. 



Avoid Lat bars, any weighted squats with bars, ( I used medicine ball instead). Leg presses, bent over rows etc. 

It's rough but definitely doable!"

Thank you!"

Sometimes we can't be with the person we love. And it hurts, worse than most other types of pain. But, we have to put ourselves first, and that's what we both have forgotten to do.

Why should I stop in when none of them have tried to contact me? It is heartbreaking. But we knew it before. We definitely knew it. But we drank with them instead. 

This time in my life has shown who my true friends are. I think I have about two remaining but I've always been a loner to an extent. Some days I get lonely but I throw myself into work or nature. I'll take a bike ride or visit a State Park. The best thing about that is those places always stay constant. Nature stays constant. And I have always held onto that, even before sobriety. 

People suck. But we will find new ones and even if we don't...we've found ourselves."
