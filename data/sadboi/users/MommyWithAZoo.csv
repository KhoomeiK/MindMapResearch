Edited: His name wasn’t pronounced John-ny but Joe-ny, so it emphasized the Jho sound"

So you could build a frame tall enough for your husband and the sheeting would let light in for your plants and keep bugs out."

AskParents,ets5nv1,t3_cd7wkz,1563137137.0,"My daughter has hair past her but and got lice and the shampoo and combs didn’t work. What worked was covering her hair in Vaseline, completely and totally. That kills everything. After that, wash with Johnson’s baby shampoo, multiple times. Next coat hair in baking sofa to absorb Vaseline, more baby shampoo. Coat hair in mayonnaise to remove the rest of the Vaseline, and more baby shampoo. 
Then you deal with the eggs. Get a bottle of Johnson’s spray detangler, pour half out into a glass. Add Rubbing alcohol, tea tree oil, eucalyptus oil, coconut oil, which hazel and apple cider vinegar. Top up with detangler from the glass. Spray on hair twice daily and brush, shake before use. It will desolve the glue that attaches the eggs, and let them wash out of your hair. It will kill the eggs so they don’t hatch, and it will repel them from your hair."
