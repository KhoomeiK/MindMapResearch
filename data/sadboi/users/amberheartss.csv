loseit,fkkygsz,t3_fj4ahr,1584294605.0,"I remember a few years back when I was successfully losing weight (first time I was able to sustain weight loss for more than a week!) and really missing the feeling of ""eating with abandon"". Over that 4-month time period (I lost 30lbs yay!!!), I would cheat from time to time and would eat too much. I loved that full feeling when I did. That feeling would stick with me over the years. 

Fast forward about 5 years, I had gained a bunch of weight back and every time I thought about dieting/tracking CICO (what made me successful the first time), I would remember that I would miss that ""eating with abandon"" feeling. It felt like scarcity. It felt like a void. It felt like I was unfulfilled. And, every time I would do the same thing that made me successful the first time, that scarcity feeling would come back and I would ""fall off the wagon"" after a week or two. I would then say fuck it and stop tracking and therefore stop losing. 

Fast forward another couple of years and now I'm playing with IF and even doing OMAD from time to time. And, I really like it. I find I'm less hungry and I also stopped snacking. The less I eat, the less hungry I get. Also, I'm aware of how the feeling of hunger will come and will go. I just notice the feeling of hunger and not react to it. It's just a feeling, it's not who I am. I am OK. I have so much abundance in my life. 

I find IF is kind of freeing too. I frickin' hate doing dishes (no dishwasher) so there are times when I barely have any dishes to do. I'll often make a veggie pasta salad for lunch that will last for 3 days and then just have cheese toast for dinner. With IF, I'm not restricting myself too much which I think fucked up my previous attempts. I'm also not weighing and tracking and counting (shit that I found tedious). I'm still eating bread and cheese, ice cream, etc. The weight is coming off sloooooowly because I haven't restricted desserts and treats too much. Having said that, I'm noticing, as time goes on, I'm making better and better choices. 

Sheesh, sorry for my ramblings... 

PS. FWIW, I do notice that some IF ramblings can feel a bit like they're sliding into ED territory. I'm aware of it and sometimes will feel a bit uncomfortable with some of the IG posts from IFers. I think as with every thing else, everything in moderation. I'm 5'4"" and 215 lbs so far from anorexia territory. And, compared to my slimmer colleagues at work, I do think my portions are a bit on the bigger side. 

PSS. I read When Food Is Love and a bunch of other Geneen Roth books. I think she's on to something. :-)"

Nope. Absolutely not your fault, unless, of course, you are carrying a sign around your neck with that wording.  

You're going to find that some men (and women) that you respect and admire from a professional aspect will engage in shitty and inappropriate behavior. No, they don't know better. No, they don't see there being a power differential. And, no they don't understand the position this puts you in. Sadly, this person may be highly successful in their career but an absolute train wreck in their personal life. Don't stay on that train, sister. 

I'd encourage you to find ways (that you feel comfortable with) to shut this kind of talk down immediately. Learn to recognize when you see the other person crossing the line, and think of some (gentle) words to say to let the person know that you're not interested in discussing these kind of topics. 

It would suck to lose a reference if you stood up for yourself but I think it could also mean that you avoid getting involved with some other drama.
