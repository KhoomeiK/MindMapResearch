You most likely can't.

This is all besides the point /u/mitsumoi1092 was making. The discussion is about *smart* people. It's easy to see poor people as dumb when you think of money-making as a simple matter of decision-making. However, there are resources involved - money itself being the most important, bar none. There are ""rich people decisions"" that poor people simply can't make without those resources. You're gonna say they could save up and gradually build a fortune over generations, but that would just prove my point. There are people who literally will never be rich in *their* lifetime, without it being a matter of dumb/smart."

With that being said, you make a good point that this could be the result of a parent's drug addiction. Not sure about this *not* being a ""result of poor"" though. Poor can look like this, as can a parent's drug addiction, but poverty and substance abuse often go hand-in-hand, so I feel like this is very likely a ""result of poor""."

DotA2,eorncfp,t1_eoq5fv7,1558809721.0,"That's very interesting, especially the Tinkoff example, but also the fact that it's so bad that it's a way to provoke physical fights.

I tend to think of a country's culture as the average personality of its residents. I've lived in the US, Canada, and France; countries where parent insults are brushed off, unless it's anything about being an orphan, or if there's another element of truth to it like joking about an addiction/sickness. Growing up in the US, I was never fazed by ""son of a bitch"" / ""motherfucker"" / anything else about my mom. I think that's because those insults are never targeted, i.e. you can't say anything mean to me about my mom if you've never met her. I've always thought that ""son of a bitch"" in particular is a stupid insult, as most people who call me that simply don't know my mom and, if anything, it insults her more than me. This is weird logic, but it comes down to the frequency of words. In France, ""fils de pute / fdp"" is said so much doesn't mean anything anymore either. It's kind of like ""cunt"" in Australia, where friends call friends that. The exact translation of ""cunt"" in French is ""con""; it and its derivatives (con, conne, connard, connasse, connerie, √† la con) have nothing to do with what ""con"" once meant, just like in Australia.

Anyway, end of lesson... I feel bad as well about the anti-Russian meme, but not *too* much, because it's lazy. DotA players will sadly never stop saying Russians are the worst - it's a stupid but easy way to simultaneously piss people off and, more importantly, to blame losses on them (""I played well, but had Russians on my team, so it's not my fault"").

>Ceb picked all the wrong words to insult a russian. As if he knew which particular string to cut.

This is probably true now that I think of it. If so, it's even more immature, offensive, and close to playground bullying. With all this being said, I hope I don't sound like I'm defending him; I'm with Solo and you on this one."
DotA2,eop92af,t3_bsi836,1558757788.0,"I am 99% sure that this is what he meant: ""Don't buy wards, it's pointless. Let these fucking Russians lose MMR; they would give an arm and a leg for MMR"". **The** **inexcusable anti-Russian sentiment is there, but nothing more**. Allow me to explain...

* The way you say ""fucking x"" in French is ""putain(s) de x"". Putain literally means 'whore', but is a versatile word akin to 'fuck'. I'm pretty sure that he was thinking ""putains de russes"", which does *not* translate to ""Russian whores"". Of course, both insults are equally toxic, but no French person rants/swears without saying 'putain' at some point. Seriously.
* As for the mother thing, ""vendre sa m√®re"" (to sell one's own mother) and variants like ""donner p√®re et m√®re"" (to give one's own parents) are the French equivalent of the English idiom ""to give an arm and a leg"" / ""would do anything"".
* One last thing to keep in mind is that a Frenchman's English is generally abysmal, and most make no effort to find something better than a literal translation of what they are thinking. Ceb's English is pretty good, but he makes the common mistake of translating insults and idioms 1-to-1. Really, it's just a lack of effort - always remember that the English can't be bothered to speak French properly, and that the French can't be bothered to speak English properly. This should come as no surprise...
