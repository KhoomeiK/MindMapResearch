Asexual,fkyqedz,t3_fla0z2,1584653976.0,"The one thing that I can tell you is that never ever have sex with somebody just because he wants it. When you don't want to be sexual with him then don't do it. When he loves you with all his heart, he would be okay with it.

When you don't have sexual attraction to anybody around you then you are asexual. That is totally valid and okay. You can be a ""cold"" person, as you call yourself, too. There is nothing wrong when you don't like this guy the way he likes you.

You can fall in love. I was at a point where I questioned myself if I like this guy (he is a good friend of mine) or if I'm in love with him. And after a while I came to the solution that I just like him as a friend. I would say I'm in love with him in a platonic way.
We will never go on dates or do all the stuff people do when they fall in love in a romantic or sexual way. But I'm happy that I love him. You can do a lot in such a situation. I told him how I feel about him and I think that was a good idea.

I hope that I helped you a bit and that you will find an answer for yourself too."
