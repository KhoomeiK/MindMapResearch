schizophrenia,fqqb27u,t3_gka1hv,1589562446.0,I got sick in 2014 and took until 2016 before I stopped thinking about what life used to be like and start being productive in my new normal but it could vary from person to person it does happen though.
schizophrenia,fqeghbu,t1_fqd1vqu,1589307159.0,I talk about this with my therapist a lot. For me everything is all or nothing. It’s something I gotta work on I guess.

schizophrenia,fqb2g2g,t3_ghetfj,1589229409.0,This was what I was like with my friends accusing them of stuff that never happened. Every time they would just deny what I thought was going on and this would annoy me. The only thing that ever changed anything was meds so that would be the recommendation. Try and convince him really gently because if someone forced me to go to hospital and take medication when I didn’t want to them I really would have a reason for accusations. If he’s not seeming dangerous to himself or others I wouldn’t force anything on him.

schizophrenia,fq3xh48,t3_ggr9bd,1589071408.0,I’ve been on Olanzapine for nearly two years now. I know what you mean for me I can never seem to sleep properly I think if you slowly lower the dose over a few months it might work. There are other stuff for anxiety but anxiety can be stubborn so if you’ve found something that helps it is good to know if nothing different works.
schizophrenia,fq2ob9i,t3_ggncff,1589058054.0,Straight up medication. Only thing to help you see clearly. Supposively CBT helps aswell but I’d just go with the generic route. If your already on meds you need a dosage change or a different medication.
schizophrenia,fq1x841,t3_ggkl2b,1589050700.0,"Done it loads of times, timeline for me is: stop taking meds loose all the side effect feel great. Then that becomes the new normal and you expect it. Then psychotic symptoms come back. End up feeling a different kind of pain."

schizophrenia,fpgnd5q,t1_fpfvwd7,1588606029.0,I heard this before would make sense because our bodies have an answer for everything. E.g. when we hurt ourselves we get a release of endorphins to help or when we’re in a life or death survival situation we can get enhanced strength and increased decision making abilities.

It’s very easy to read into things wrong when your looking out for stuff. Let’s say you mention the car just as a conversation starter and they seem to get anxious they may have just remembered their dinner is burning in the oven if you get what I mean.

schizophrenia,foub2j4,t3_g9gxiu,1588080491.0,The world is always progressing sometimes we make great strides and other times we will make mistakes. The world is essentially trial and error and over time things get better and better generally. It’s easier to focus on the negative things like the breakdown of face to face communication and social media seems to be the main talking point in recent times. Put it this way though in 100 years there will be far more advanced anti-psychotics with less side effects they just need to be discovered. There may have even been a bigger breakthrough where an altogether different approach is taken which is far far better. Sorry for the essay but as a whole we advance and maybe somethings are lost but for greater gain that’s why we move in that direction.

schizophrenia,fnu4ji8,t3_g3x6m2,1587254411.0,It ties in with one of my theories that 30 to 1 hour after wake up you act strange. Usually I suffer from terrible persistent anxiety but I’m always safe just after waking up. Maybe it has something with sleeping driving thought patterns into you.
schizophrenia,fnu4at1,t3_g3xp5u,1587254272.0,Some of the bad feeling you are getting from people may be delusions of persecution.

For me even what I did earlier today doesn’t seem like it really happened because I’ve had so many thoughts and things happen since then/my mind is a million miles away from then.

schizophrenia,fn7dsse,t3_g02eng,1586718349.0,Sleep deprivation can exasperate conditions that cause psychosis. For example sleep deprivation can cause mania (bipolar) and bipolar can cause psychosis. Don’t be alarmed but be in contact with doctors.

schizophrenia,flariph,t3_fnl86d,1584989669.0,"From my experience when your having a psychotic episode nothing can convince you otherwise. So you can try but most likely it will go in one ear and out the other. Psychotic medication can take up to 6 months to clear out stubborn delusions etc. so maybe she’s never even been clear yet since this started. This may be why she stopped taking meds as she was still psychotic. As for the debate about Schizophrenia and Schizoaffective. This is what I understand about it is. Schizoaffective is when you have psychotics symptoms and mood disorder symptoms that are independent of one another, so not manic depression causing psychosis or mania causing psychosis. Otherwise it would just be major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder with psychotic symptoms not a schitz spectrum disorder. Hope this helps! Havnt researched it but my mind tends to be a sponge for these types of things."
schizophrenia,fl8q93b,t3_fnc15t,1584929649.0,It’s a combination. Psychotic disorders are tough to deal with at all times but medication is vital for reducing psychotic stuff it’s just that almost everyone will get side effects with meds so it’s never easy.

schizophrenia,fl70bl4,t3_fmzaep,1584890092.0,It depends on if your psychosis has gone due to medication or if your actually in the clear. Medication can come with its hinderances but with the right mix can help fix the bad parts of it.

schizophrenia,fj4q8c4,t1_fj4pslk,1583014281.0,An example would be if I’m walking to the shop at night I’ll be constantly checking my surroundings to make sure I’m not going to get mugged (not psychosis wise like there’s a big plot out to get me) just like a general mugger about.

schizophrenia,fj48s4n,t3_fbgyjo,1583002836.0,To answer your initial question. Zopiclone is quite strong stuff it’s didn’t really affect my psychosis when I’ve taken it but I suffer from severe social problems aswell and when I’ve taken it and ended up socialising before I fell asleep it’s has had a massive effect I felt far less self conscious. So basically from my experience it is quite powerful stuff even on 7.5. As far as Schizophrenia keep in touch with medical professionals but from my understanding most people have it laying dormant in their brain chemistry and it’s activated by a trigger/s. So just keep talking to professionals. They do help albeit it may not seem like it at times.
schizophrenia,fj46aji,t3_fbcp42,1583001256.0,I can’t speak about voices as I have barely ever heard them but I can speak on delusions. It’s the obvious route when the world seems all messed up and you have all these thoughts running through your head god/heaven/angels/demons are where the mind drifts towards as they make the most sense. They are all powerful beings that could explain all the goings on that’s why people drift towards this.
