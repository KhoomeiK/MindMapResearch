raisedbyborderlines,fooo4yg,t3_g8iyve,1587942913.0,"I have read this thread off and on about people with bpd moms. I am deeply sorry that you all have had such painful experiences with your moms. My mom, i believe, had undiagnosed bpd, but i see her differently. She tried to abort me..my twin was aborted but i survived. I had physical problems when i was little as a result of it and her drinking while she was  pregnant. She controlled me and my brothers with guilt... didn't really touch us or give us healthy love...wasn't allowed to become my own person..raised to be enmeshed with her. When i would try to express my feeling..thoughts..ideas...they were met with criticism. I've spent years trying to unravel it all and still struggle to figure out who i am. I never blamed my mom or felt negative toward her though because i could see her pain and how deeply she struggled. You see, she was put in an orphanage at age 3...never knew either of her parents...was neglected and hurt in the orphange..Horrible place to be raised. At age of 13 the orphange closed and she was shuffeled to different foster homes... When she turned 18 she met a man she fell in love with....married him..had 3 boys with him. He was an alcoholic and abusive. She divorced him. Had my 4th brother by a different man and me- her last kid- through an affair with a married man..who never claimed me. When i was four she got with an abusive alcoholic man who was in our lives for several year. And on and on the story goes. She had intense abandonment issues, struggled greatly  with her emotions, had no self-worth,  had intense, stormy relationships, etc..etc..I  never blamed her for not giving me what she never had. She wasn't able to give me what i needed because she never got it herself. Our roles were often reversed with me trying to give her what she missed...what we both missed. My heart often broke for her and for myself too. It wasn't about her not loving me..she just didn't know how. She died in 2016 and my deep hope has always been that God holds her in his arms and has healed her shattered core. I miss her deeply and struggle to heal my own wounds as i still hold her close in heart."
