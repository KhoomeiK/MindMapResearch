AnxietyDepression,fodxpct,t3_g6wqn3,1587692112.0,"Everyone experiences thoughts & emotions in their life differently, it also greatly depends on the surrounding you're currently situated in. One could argue that it's understandable that not everyone can relate to what you're feeling at a specific moment. But it still leaves you feel a certain way..  I come from a place where not many people talk about their personal feelings, a lot of them simply choose to suppress it. Which I find quite sad.. I often feel anxious & depressed for various reasons but I also don't really have anyone to open up to personally.

Therefore I'm glad that forums like these exist, it still gives you a place to share your story. Even though nobody might know you personally, it can help a lot knowing that you're not alone in this."

AnxietyDepression,fn3szpp,t1_fn09o3c,1586627322.0,"Thanks man, really means alot <3

It's just really hard sometimes to not feel beaten down, because of overwhelming emotions, but I'm trying my best & keeping my hopes up that it gets better. 

Thanks for your comment, I hope your doing fine as well ."
ADHD,fmxuhru,t3_fy21l8,1586472115.0,Damn this hits close to home.. Almost like something I could of written.. I feel ya dude. It's so hard to focus on the things that are important when all your thoughts are strangling you up inside.
AnxietyDepression,fda5z7i,t1_fd3gk9i,1578242164.0,"It's a tool you can use to combat negative thinking, almost like a weapon. 

You can find numerous articles about it online. Here's an example:

 [https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/) 

If you're anything like me, you might undergo moments where your thoughts & feelings are widely out of proportion. You might be way more anxious & sad over a situation than you need to be.

For me I've dealt with this ever since I was a kid. The more you support negative neurological pathways, the more you lean into these intense negative feelings when they arise, the worse it gets.

CBT is all about taking those certain thoughts into consideration and actually asking yourself if these thoughts you have are really valid. Instead of directly acting out on those thoughts sprees, you stop yourself and you start to slowly analyze these thoughts you have.  Are your thoughts really based on solid facts? Or is it based on poor self image? or poor expectations? Understand that you can choose to link a certain feeling to a certain situation. So why are you choosing to make yourself feel so sad or anxious over something? Why would you choose to let something affect you so much? Maybe you've set out incredible expectations to yourself and if so why would you do that? 

It's really important to ask yourself these questions, and to do it over and over again. The more you come in terms with who you are the less anxiety & sadness you will experience. 

Things that really help are, going to bed early (not doing too many demanding tasks in the evening)  and also try waking up earlier. Instead of having to rush your way to school or work in the morning, you can take some more time for yourself to relax. If you feel really stressed and anxious, take some time for yourself to meditate and to really get into that feeling. Try to slowly analyze it, don't judge it! And then slowly let it pass. This proces might be really hard in the beginning but the more you do it, the better it gets. 

&#x200B;

But before trying this yourself it's important that you will read this!

Mental problems aren't something to be taken lightly, depending on your situation  
it might be best to have numerous weapons laying in your arsenal. 

Like I've said CBT is one of them, but it might not be enough when facing a very difficult obstacle(s) in your life.

&#x200B;

Best of luck to you, and take care."
AnxietyDepression,fcvvmzm,t3_ej6ehk,1578011123.0,I have this aswell.. I wish I could understand my thoughts & feelings .. It's just stupid feel so depressed & anxious for no reason.
AnxietyDepression,fcugx04,t1_fctorl4,1577980683.0,"Thanks so much for this man <3. 

I must say I'm doing better and better since last year but there are moments where I'm just a little too impatient and I start to reconnect with negative feelings.. And that's just a bad thing to do. 

I know mindfulness is the key and therefore I will definitely give this a chance.

Thanks for hearing me out, much love <3"

AnxietyDepression,f9rl24o,t1_f9mp22q,1575577817.0,"It could be that I'm suffering from a hormonal imbalance and this could definitely play a part, but so far I haven't been diagnosed with anything serious. 

But to be honest I think it's just a bunch things that are all falling apart together right now, combined with a lot of negativity and just a great lack of self acceptance. 

I might consider seeing a mental health therapist, since I'm currently not seeing one. Currently physically not doing really well so that's something which I have to deal with first. 

  
I still need to teach myself that certain things in life are just not in my control or simply in a very limited way. Mindfulness helps but I still have a long way to go.   


Nevertheless I appropriate your advice and thanks for commenting."

AnxietyDepression,f9ikstp,t3_e565ee,1575339551.0,"I have this a lot, I've come to admit that I'm probably an inherently different thinker than most of the people which I share classes with. I think that some people are just able to acclimatize better to the chaotic aspects of life. 

For me I always have had trouble fitting in.. I don't consider myself as a smart individual but rather more conscious than the average person.  
What you got to understand is that everyone is different. Everyone has a different background & a different view of the world. 

If you feel very distanced towards the people within your life then it might be a good opportunity to actually work on yourself a bit more.   
I can tell you this, it's pointless trying to understand everyone else because humans are very complex beings. I have a brother and we're essentially flesh and blood yet we are two completely different people. Even though we find common ground about a lot of topics, there are certain aspects about him that I could never truly understand.   


**TL;DR**

Stop trying to figure everyone else out, don't waste all your time trying to fit in. Instead look for things that you are interested in whether that's biology, philosophy, video games, science or sports it can be anything. And then take a look into areas where people share common interests and take it from there. There's always a good possibility that you find more like minded people that way."

I guess at the end of the day it's really about being mindful of things and not being too judgmental about yourself & others.

But eventually things will change and new things will come into you life. And when that happens you'll be so glad that you pulled through.

Simply stay strong & keep fighting! And nevertheless I wish you a happy birthday :)"
