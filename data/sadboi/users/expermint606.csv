asexuality,fipuuud,t1_fipr72w,1582622576.0,Thank you all! I was confused i didn’t know there was a difference. Now i can proudly say that I’m an ace :)
asexuality,fio4y0g,t1_fio2nq9,1582576375.0,"exactly! I meant sexual attraction! like i don’t remember i’ve ever felt that I want to be with someone sexually, and also when I’m dating someone it kinda scares me with they show their sexual feelings i would be like “ugh it’s that part”. 

the reason i’m not sure about being asexual is that I sometimes feel horny(?) so idk"
BreakUps,fi4mt0q,t1_fi47ocm,1582144344.0,"the reason we broke is not that we don’t love each other anymore, the reason is with our differences and circumstances we can never be together and we realized that from the beginning. So, talking to him again won’t be a good idea for both of us... i wish we could be friends but we can’t separate the love from this relationship"
BreakUps,fi3ln42,t1_fi3l290,1582122244.0,actually he helped me each time i asked for help. i don’t want to bother him anymore but i really desperately miss him. few weeks ago i was willing to move on and I was even having fun with a guy that likes me. but then i heard a song and i couldn’t help but remember each and every sweet moment with him and i started missing him again..

BPD,fgiibth,t1_fgi4g52,1580822511.0,"Before knowing about my bpd, i was so attached to my ex i couldn’t handle the fact that he’s not with me anymore and honestly i still can’t. 
It hurts, it really does but she’s hurting you more i mean you should know that you deserve better, someone that can make you feel safe not making your fear worse."
BPD,fcqb2xj,t3_ei3rkd,1577882483.0,my friends call me “a living rainbow” “happiness figure” and stuff like that and they have no idea about my self-harm wounds

sometimes i need to be upset with them because they were mean to me they don’t deserve me but... i don’t want to end up fighting with them, i just make things go :("
selfharm,f7ycktm,t3_dxsxjt,1574092113.0,"probably 15, it started when i used to soak my hands in hot water when i get upset, then i was hitting my thighs with my fist and now I’m 22 and i recently started using actual sharp stuff"

Vent,f1wiefb,t1_f1tfz13,1569785173.0,"nobody in this place would understand me, when I tried to vent they were like “stop those ideas you’re dramatic you’re emotional” so I stopped expressing my feeling to others it’s much better to keep them bottled in this toxic, conservative, restrictive environment. Believe me, I know what consequences I’ll face if I spoke my heart... 

anyway, thank you."

For me, my ex helped me change to a better person, he helped me learn and think in a better more healthier way and I miss him so much I miss how supportive he was when everyone was against me. Maybe leaving me was his one and only mistake..."

I hope he’s doing well."
BreakUps,ewzlx3u,t1_ewyb7wp,1565897561.0,"oh thank you so much, somehow your words helped me realize something. I always thought that if I’m not giving someone the same love and affection I gave to my ex then it means that I’m not serious about the relationship.
