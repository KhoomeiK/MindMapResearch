Portland,fqagq9r,t1_fq1sctk,1589218786.0,"I wondered about this, too, and gave it a google.

The charming fellow wearing the ""#9ISMYPUMP"" shirt/gun paraphernalia is Kristopher Foster, a known and active neo-nazi who advocates, among other things, killing Jewish people and speaking at #HimToo events inciting domestic violence. 

And I don't mean neo-nazi lite. I mean full-bore POS dickbag.

https://rosecityantifa.org/articles/kristopher-foster/

His #9ISMYPUMP shirt originates from a ""light-hearted"" ""random"" ""joke"" on the town's closed Facebook page. It's a dog-whistle simultaneously inviting racist shits to identify themselves by taking a picture infront of a ""random"" (I think you're right about the gun reference) Fred Meyer gas pump while simultaneously drumming up customers for his local delivery business.

In a speech by fellow ass-blowing scumbag Tiny Toese (founding member of Portland Proud Boys chapter and... Boy... A lot of other terrible things, have a Google) he referred to Foster as ""the greatest troll of all time"". 

Just goes to back up the intentions behind these ""sit-ins"" and ""protests"". As usual, their little stunts have very little to do with peaceful personal freedom and everything to do with thinly-veiled hate and violence. 

So.... basically IMHO fuuuuuuck this. I'm not a violent person, but the turn this has taken wouldn't have me shedding tears if these people get sick and beg for medical care from the workers they're endangering."

But I am disturbed by the ""you stayed it's your fault"" tilt of the comments on here.

I remember hearing that it takes the average victim 7 tries to leave the abuser.   


My advice would be to seek outside support as soon as possible. Call the domestic abuse hotline, talk to someone, try to find a therapist, get professional support to shore-up your reserves which can be so depleted by trying to navigate this terrain.   


You are already absolutely moving in the right direction by reaching out here. Keep moving in that direction and remember that you are not crazy and you are not alone. You are in fact very, very strong for making it to where you are. Not the opposite. <3"

My personal experience: Like most meds you likely won't notice a change the first time you take it, or the 2nd or third.  (I def didn't, aside from the desperate hope that it would help.) You're going to be titrate your dose x2 every week or something similar and, while everyone is of course different (brains are weird!), \*most\* people don't notice much until the 100mg or so and the ""recommended therapeutic dose"" in 200 for some reason.

Good for you for seeing a therapist. My current Dr. agrees with me that diagnosis is just a tool that can be used to direct treatment, i.e. meds, i.e. SSRIs/SSNRIs sometimes cause people with this spectrum disorder to swing too far to the ""up,"" mood stabilizers sometimes help, etc. But diagnosis doesn't do much good as a label in and of its self.
