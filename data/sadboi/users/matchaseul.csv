MentalHealthPH,fph2o25,t3_gcgwn8,1588613892.0,"Kinda confused on whether I should try applying for a job or go for therapy. After this quarantine I wanted to get a job already but with my social anxiety I don't know if I may be able to do it. I think I'm gonna chicken out again if I do. 

I don't have much money to get therapy and asking my family for help is out of the question. So it's just an endless cycle of either getting a job to get money for therapy or to go the therapy first because I don't know if I can even work in this state."
SuicideWatch,fmgvwv4,t3_fv78xy,1586059261.0,I get this too since I know I can never really hurt myself so I always imagine what if I get robbed today? What if someone kidnaps me then kills me? What if someone shot me? And the list goes on.
SuicideWatch,fmgvp4m,t3_fuygxq,1586059093.0,sometimes i do but it also makes me mad at myself because it could have happened if i didn't fuck up before

SuicideWatch,fkwadyd,t1_fkw9pgk,1584587258.0,"There are so many things that can stop me. 
1. The police. People can't go outside here unless you have to go to work and I don't work so I can't go outside  and show them a work ID they'd just take me home.

2. Money. I don't have enough money to live on my own. I don't live in a first world country. It's gonna be hard to look for a new home with this little money I have. I'd have to commute to look for a place to and god knows how that will take.

3. We're in quarantine so even if I get pass the police nothing's open. No hotels, motels, nor even transportation so I can't even move to another city/province.

There are so many more even if it we aren't on quarantine but I think is getting long already."
actuallesbians,fiji0tz,t3_f7vv52,1582448881.0,"I think I've had so many crushes from elementary to highschool but since I went to a catholic school I've always thought that whatever I felt for a girl is probably just admiration. A teacher from when I was in 3rd grade ""enlightened"" us about that that when we think we have a crush on the same sex it's just ""admiration"" or platonic so I've thought that way ever since. But now that I look back wHEW she really do be lesbian"

SuicideWatch,f9b9slx,t3_e40jii,1575210575.0,Every time the news reports say that a celebrity committed suicide I just get so jealous and think if they can do it why can't I?
depression,f77pyso,t3_dunyqm,1573470251.0,I'm the same. As much as I want to die there's a fear of being a vegetable or getting a major injury that will just make my life worse. It's really hard to find a method that will work.
depression,f77kt0f,t3_dujc20,1573461753.0,"I agree with this it's really stupid because some people wouldn't really call/see you as successful unless you work an office job. So whatever your dream is people would mostly ridicule you and tell you to ""be realistic, that profession will get you nowhere""."
SuicideWatch,f77kmj6,t3_dum0fw,1573461464.0,Most of the time I think of just running away and start fresh but I don't even have enough money to survive out there. My money would probably just last me out there for 2 weeks and I hate that I won't have money to buy what I need to actually commit suicide. I really think it'd just add more problems but if you have enough money then I think yea you can start fresh somewhere.
depression,f6yoon4,t3_dtjg6g,1573289580.0,Yea thinking about how I was functional and happy back then comparing to my life right now is just making me feel worse. I always think past me was my peak and I can never be like her again.

Philippines,f5x2w1y,t3_dpkdpi,1572534566.0,"I remember when I told my mom about my suicide attempts and the anxiety I get from going to college and she just told me ""Kpop, anime, games yan ang mga demonyo!"" then sent me to her new religion. She didn't even ask me why I felt like that and why I had to do that. Makes me not want to open up to her anymore."
depression,f3jnxhn,t3_dh4dim,1570955659.0,"My mother is like this. I remember telling her about my suicide attempts and she got so mad at me and told me it's because of kpop, anime, games, phone etc. that the devil is possessing me. I think most parents are like this because they're so uneducated about mental health. They still don't treat it as an illness unless it's like what the media shows that people are going ""insane"" even though most cases aren't like that."
SuicideWatch,f20k8al,t3_db9n3y,1569860644.0,"Yea I usually do this with plushies and game characters. I've distanced myself so much from everyone around me and I'm scared to initiate conversations so they fill up my ""socializing"" for the day."
SuicideWatch,eyxnsgx,t3_cza1t7,1567558019.0,When I was 9 years old I had dengue then had it again when I was 13. I heard dengue is lethal and I wished it would have killed me back then. Though when I was young I haven't really thought of suicide so I did focus more on getting better but such a shame.
SuicideWatch,eyxn72j,t3_cz8j81,1567557595.0,"Same and it happens to every single day it's so exhausting. It's not even alternating on days it alternates in just minutes like one moment I'd think about getting my life together, I'd go online to look for jobs or look which colleges I can still apply at this time of the year then the next minute I'll start thinking about how it will all go wrong or how exhausting, humumiliating, and nerve-wracking would it be to do all of those. It's a cycle every single day and it makes me more confused about living another day or just ending it."
SuicideWatch,eyw2shz,t3_cz474w,1567519411.0,bruh the replies...they're kinda mean ðŸ˜¬. I'm kinda in the same boat as you. When I was in highschool I did nothing but study just to get a good grade because that's what my family told me. I feel nothing every day and I'm trying to cover it up by saying this is for the future but I don't even know what I want my future to be. I don't know if you're the same in that part but maybe we're like this because we don't have a dream that's why we're unmotivated. I'd still suggest to go a consultation I know it's hard to motivate yourself to go heck I had the idea for a consultation last 2017 and only went through last May 2019. Just so you'll know what's really going on with you.
SuicideWatch,eys1q4r,t1_eyrvdku,1567384554.0,I'm like this too I never really let them know what's happening to me and the one time I did my mother sent me to her new religion to basically repent for thinking like that. Never told them anything since and I regret ever saying it to her.
SuicideWatch,exasrdp,t3_crqq88,1566115045.0,I'm in the same situation too I've been researching suicide methods for 2 years and I can't do most of it because they're expensive or have a risk making me a vegetable. I'm just praying I get into an accident or someone robs me and kills me in the process.
SuicideWatch,ewijusp,t3_coestd,1565450810.0,Yea I wish that every time I sleep or at least wish I'd get nightmares because I've heard it could kill you in your sleep too.
SuicideWatch,ew2t7p0,t3_cm9566,1565055261.0,Yea I've been feeling like that. I'm not as excited as I used to be and even the things I loved to do just doesn't spark anything in me anymore. Every day I always just lay down and sleep or just browse my phone.
SuicideWatch,ev10b2g,t3_ci25z8,1564149987.0,yea like i'm so tired of feeling like this but at the same time i can't even kill myself because of the chances that i'd survive but with a major injury  and it scares me to end up probably worse than before. Sometimes I just wish for an accident to happen to me since I can't do anything to end this.

What's a good call center to apply for someone who's new to it? Also tips for looking/applying for jobs I've never really worked anywhere and it's making me anxious to try it out."
