depression,fe6lboh,t1_fb2h3cp,1578894724.0,This is exactly what happened to me in University. I would fear leaving just because I knew that it would hit like a ton of bricks when I got into the car.
lonely,fe3jo8e,t3_enldph,1578849850.0,I've noticed more recently that I attract people who do not consider my feelings most of the time. Possibly because I don't have want to be alone. So I believe your words ring true.
lonely,fe3jfck,t3_enlehx,1578849766.0,Honestly I don't think gender plays much of a role in our loneliness. I think that we just don't have social personalities which makes us more likely to be by ourselves. This makes us think there's something wrong with us but in reality we just don't match up with others like us because they are in the same boat with little social interaction.
depression,fe0a9zc,t3_encztz,1578807566.0,I use things to distract myself. Video games and any media no longer work but they did when I was young. Now I have to distract myself with puzzles and problems so I tend to program my free time away. Basically I do things without thinking about the effort it a actually takes.
depression,fe09l47,t1_fdzn4et,1578806933.0,I agree with this. It takes some time to figure what works for you best but once you find it the feelings will lessen and you'll actually be able to focus on other things.
depression,fe08dcy,t3_enefu5,1578805841.0,Similar to the rest of the comments. I also feel this way. Even around family or friends that care about me.
lonely,fe07u1i,t1_fe07jxm,1578805386.0,Where is the line though? Some of those are legitimate reasons. When do you know when a illegitimate reason masquerading as a legitimate one?
lonely,fe07964,t1_fe074ly,1578804907.0,So what would one need to believe to consistently make themselves alone?
