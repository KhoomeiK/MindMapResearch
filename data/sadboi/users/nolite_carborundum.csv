I'm on high doses of lithium and an SSRI as well as having had repeated ketamine infusions (under medical supervision; please talk to your doctor about the cognitive issues). My daily meds could be influencing my cognition, as could having been so severely depressed/ low level residual symptoms.  Or it could have been the ketamine. All that said, any changes have been fairly minor and I don't find that much a price compared to either remaining horrifically depressed or having gone through with suicide.  I am now functional and actually capable of  doing things and learning, participating in therapy etc. In order to really assess whether ketamine as used therpeutically in  controlled low doses causes cognitive impairment would require a large randomized controlled trial or series of such trials.  Unfortunately we just don't have those yet."

Self injurious punching biting etc tics for me, came first before the intentional self harm.  I was pretty accustomed to self punching biting scratching etc.  Looking back sometimes the urges feel very similar, if not the same, tic vs self harm...it blurs together.  I tend to consider self harm or like, the kind of self harm I need to be really concerned about as ones that are distinct from my tics, and is very driven by my depression.  For me tics are most typically preceeded by a physical feeling an urge that spot I  need to hit or whatever has.  Self harm somewhat so but maybe a bit less, and it's usually more intentional, ie I gather tools etc, vs a tic just kinda happens if you don't try to suppress.  I've also recognized that self injurious tics sometimes scratch the self harm itch, just in a way that is more tic-like.  I don't think in my case there's a bright line between the two, since both involve sensation seeking and an out-of-control need for a certain kind of pain, except when tools are involved....then it's pretty clear."

Tourettes,fil82ig,t1_fiknm6x,1582495690.0,"I definitely agree, the proposed policy towards barring anyone with \*any\* mental health condition from ever owning a firearm is pretty blatantly discriminatory, and should not be allowed.  Roughly 1 in 3 people will experience a psychiatric or psychological condition in their lifetimes.   Clearly, barring that 1/3 of the population from gun ownership for no reason other than they at some point in time had a diagnosable mental health condition is absurd.  To my knowledge, the current standards are that if you had been involuntarily committed you cannot own one.   I believe you're somewhat mistaken about the standards for involuntary commitment if you are indeed in the US.   The standard is that a doctor can only  hold you involuntarily if you are considered an immediate risk to yourself or others' physical safety, (ie they have reason to believe you are an imminent suicide risk or may physically assault or murder someone) or so gravely disabled (say dementia, psychosis, dissociative state, etc) that you cannot meet your own most basic needs, like eating, drinking, and having the insight to not do things that would hurt you like wandering out into heavy traffic, and there is no one in your life like a friend or relative who would help provide those things and keep you safe.  That's literally it, for US laws.  Even under these circumstances, they can only hold someone involuntarily for 72 hours, and after that they must get a court order from a magistrate or judge, at which time the person being court ordered has the chance to make their case to the magistrate/judge that they are competent to refuse consent and do not need such treatment.   Even if they got an order to hold you involuntarily, they can only force emergency lifesaving treatment on you, say sedation if you were trying to injure yourself or someone else.  Forcible treatment requires a separate court order to authorize it.   Even under circumstances of court orders and severe mental illness, an individual always has the right to be held in the least restrictive environment that is safe and can meet their needs.  For instance, someone with a psychotic disorder might be under court order to get injected long lasting medications every month to control their illness, but otherwise be free to do as they choose and live where they want.  Short of emergency treatment or court order, you can ALWAYS refuse medication.  And even if they did try to hold you, you can request to see a  magistrate/judge.  People with extremely severe TS I know of sometimes present to the ER requesting sedation to stop painful, self-injurious, endless tic attacks, and are sometimes mistaken as being ""mentally ill/crazy"" and the hospital tries to hold them involuntarily.  Usually, this doesn't work out for the hospital (and the person with TS and their family are furious and start calling making complaints, calling patient advocates and lawyers) and a doctor with half a brain cell realizes the mistake. It happens, it's very traumatic when it occurs, and it's horrible, I'm not gonna sugar coat it. But if your TS is mild you're at essentially no risk whatsoever of being involuntarily committed or having forcible treatment court ordered, unless you presented to a medical professional with one of the above mental health concerns like being suicidal, homicidal/likely to seriously harm someone else, or so gravely disabled you were in danger."

Tourettes,fij28e5,t1_fih39fn,1582432974.0,"You're absolutely right it's tied to dysfunction of the basal ganglia, however I'd like to push back on your presumption that the problem is the word ""mental"" or being classified or treated by psychiatrists and psychologists.  Most people with TS have comorbid psychiatric conditions, myself included, I have several, because TS likes to bring its unwelcome friends to the party.  Notably, for many with TS, the comorbidities like OCD and ADHD and depression so on are much more impairing than the TS itself. So if the TS community were to try to totally dissociate itself from the mental health community at large, you'd be inadvertantly further stigmatizing the vast majority of people with TS+.  What's more, the problem is the stigma against neuropsychriatic disorders, which is a social problem and one that is unnecessary.  The problem isn't the word, it's the awful things people think associated with it, it's saneism or ableism that's the problem, really, not that researchers classify our disorder as neuropsychiatric."
Tourettes,fij1jiu,t3_f7wk1a,1582432503.0,"Let's start by examining the patently false dichotomy between ""mental"" and ""neurological"" aka ""mind"" and ""body"".   Based on modern neuroscience, we know this is a fallacy.  Our mind is in our brain.  Our brain is our mind.  If this was not the case, why would people with a very clear physical injury to the brain suffer psychological damage like lack of impulse control or personality change?  Think of Phineas Gage, a guy in the early 1800s who had the misfortune of having a large iron rod shot through his head in a construction accident, that destroyed much of his left prefrontal cortex. He suffered dramatic personality changes and could no longer function in the same capacity socially or occupationally and had developed a very bad temper.  Were his problems neurological, or mental...or...both?  They were both, as is anything ""mental"".  We know this today due to neuroscience and psychology which have made tremendous leaps since the time the DSM was first conceived of.  I could go on about fMRI evidence and the way every experience we ever have and every memory we ever had is encoded in the connections between our neurons, but I think that's a bit micro picture, when you're more interested in the macro, the why question of it.  Also, for reference, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are also in the DSM, as are brain injuries.  Do you think anyone is calling those purely ""mental""?  It's a book written so psychiatris and psychologists can classify conditions people have to be able to study and learn to treat them, and also so they can bill your insurance.  I won't even get started on the BS that is insurance...  


 But back to the topic, the reason for the divide between mental and neurological and body and mind goes all the way back to Descartes, a French philosopher in the 1600s, who postulated that the body was physical and it was entirely separate from the mind which he and many prominent thinkers of the time conceived of as a soul or spirit, something supernatural that was not tied to the mortality of the physical world.  Now, psychology, and even the American Psychiatric Association, those who write the DSM,  are begrudgingly beginning to move towards an understanding of the brain as the mind and the mind as the brain.  The field of neuropsychology is a great example of this blending picture of the sciences, neurology, a ""hard"" science, and psychology, a ""soft"" science.  Psychologists work hand in hand with psychiatrists and neuroscience researchers doing fMRIS and PET scans to be able to see and study the functional changes of the brain as people undergo psychotherapy and behavioral therapy.   That's right, if you're in therapy for something, say CBiT for TS tics, the way your brain functions will actually change in a visible manner from how it was before therapy on fMRI, well, if CBiT works for you.  


I of anyone appreciate that TS is not merely some sort of ""mental"" and I use that in scare quotes to denote alllll the negative ""crazy"" and stigmatizing connotations of it, disorder.   See my TS is/was so severe, I had to have experimental brain surgery--awake--to improve my tics enough that I could function.  While I was in brain surgery, I heard the activity of my brain that the surgical probes picked up and turned into sound on a special computer.  And yknow what? There was a different noise, a different type of activity every time I had my tics.  Later studying neuroscience, I'd learn this activity I heard, a sudden screechy noise, is called burst activity, while the background radio-static-like activity I heard is called phasic activity.  So yes.  I heard my tics, I heard my brain making my tics.  I know probably better than anyone else that it's ""neurological.""  But the same probes, which control my tics, if placed somewhere else in my brain, could have induced personality changes or emotional changes.  Would those changes be neurological, or mental?  Or...both?  In light of this false dichotomy, many researchers now refer to TS as a neuropsychiatric disorder. Neither purely ""mental"" (and all the erroneous but negative ""crazy""  connotations it carries) nor totally physical, as most people with TS do not have gross anatomical brain abnormalities, but a fusion of the two.  Hell, even the term psychiatric connotes more medical issue than it does purely ""mental.""  Which of course, TS is, a medical and neurological as well a s psychological issue. Because those are all ultimately just facets of the same damn thing.  My brain is me. My brain is my mind and my mind is my brain. Your brain is you. Your personality, your ideas, your likes and dislikes, your loves and hatreds, your memories and all your experiences and perceptions are registered and stored in your brain.  And Cartesian dualism is total bullshit.

depressionregimens,f9t3cu2,t3_e6mifr,1575607506.0,"Yes, in part, but that's hardly all of it.  To put it another way, even if it's not solely and entirely caused by chemical imbalances, correcting chemical imbalances by increasing the availability of serotonin norepinepherine and dopamine to neurons is known unequivocally to begin a process towards long term potentiation, activation of mTORR and the BDNF cascades promoting neurogenesis. This undoes the damage to the hippocampus caused by Hypothalammic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis overactivation and can eventually reverse hippocampal atrophy and the amygdalar dendritic hypertrophy which is associated with severe and long term depression.    In more layman's terms, since not everyone's studied neuroscience, being depessed makes your body make stress hormones that kill brain cells in your memory center and make the ones in the fear center bigger and stronger.  Yes, depression literally can cause brain damage. Antidepressant medications, like SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, MAOIs, and having treatments like ketamine or ECT all contribute to the same end-game goal: contributing to growing new brain cells, enabling reversal of the damage to the memory centers and learning processes to resume.    Ketamine (and potentially ECT) is unique in that they can immediately begin this process, whereas normal antidepressant drugs take several weeks to go from increases in monoamines (the brain chemicals mentioned) to the BDNF cascade causing neurogenesis (new brain cell growth) that reverses depressive symptoms and suicidality.    I've literally gone in to a ketamine consult ready to kill myself early in the afternoon, and gone home a few hours later nauseous and spacey, but happy.  There are very, very real chemical things involved in depression, which are miraculously proving to be amenable to rapid antidepressant therapy such as ketamine.   While ketamine does not work for everyone, it's just another avenue of potential for rapidly effective, lifesaving treatment.   Further research into NMDA antagonist therapies for depression, as well as other psychedelic drugs shows quite a bit of promise at awakening the neurogenesis mechanisms of depressed brains.   Every medical advancement in psychiatry saves lives.  So absolutely, ""chemical imbalance,"" while over-simplistic, is a very valuable jumping-off point to understanding the physiology of depressive disorders."

It wasn't until fall when I got stressed out again and the depression came back we found it was actually lasting effects of ketamine, which had been so helpful and stopped my initial depression.  I'm still depressed after having one followup treatment of ketamine.  The last one's effects only lasted a few days.  I'm having another this week, and am still trying different oral antidepressants with my psychiatrist.  Ketamine helps immediately, but its effects don't last forever, unfortunately.  A study found the acute effects of one infusion wear off after about a week, although that week of improvement can be life-saving in acutely suicidal individuals.   I view using ketamine similarly to how  ECT is traditionally used.  An initial course can seem curative, but symptoms will come back without maintenance treatment.   This can mean either followup treatments with ketamine/ECT or just maintaining with oral medications if you can find something effective for you.

So yes, subjectively it can feel like you have some control over it, but objectively suppression is not going to last forever, even if you can do it for a little while.   If you  have Tourette's, tics are ultimately involuntary more than anything else, even if there is a little flexibility in terms of how you respond to the tic urge.  If you're interested in changing how you respond to the tic urge or learning to minimize your tics there's habit reversal therapy or cognitive behavioral intervention for tics, CBiT, which can be pretty effective, without the side effects of drugs."

psychopharmacology,f6y4kut,t3_dtldph,1573267469.0,"OK, the schooling will give you hell, I'm not even a pre-med student and I know that.  I took psychopharmacology, and it's an amazing field with so much potential.  You're gonna have a lot of studying to do.  But beyond that...for when you're actually practicing, here's some advice based on the traits I wish more doctors embodied. Namely, you'll need to be a good listener, flexible, creative, and intellectually curious. Why?

Well, sometimes weird things will happen when you give your patient a med that is supposed to do one thing, but ends up doing something totally different.  As a pharmacologist, you should expect that to sometimes happen, and know what it means.  For example, If you give a patient who's depressed an SSRI or SNRI and they suddenly become manic, they're probably bipolar.  They need a mood stabalizer or antipsychotic on top of an antidepressant.  That's just an easy, cut and dried classic example.  Point being, every person you give a drug is an experiment to see how they respond.  Some will respond miraculously well to a drug and never need anything else again but that same prescription. Some will seem to have every rare, obscure and serious medication reaction documented. Sometimes it will be the new med you just prescribed that landed them in the ER, such as a severe extrapyramidal reaction to an antipsychotic which can require IV administration of antidote.  Some of your patients may become more symptomatic, not less, on medications, such as SSRI induced exacerbation of depression, such as is described on the black box warning on antidepressants as potentially causing suicide.  This also happens and is something to be prepared for, logistically and emotionally.  Some of your patients will prove extremely treatment resistant never improving no matter what you do.  If you think someone needs something else, beyond what you can provide that's your job to speak up and say it. There will be patients that would be best served if you spoke up and said ""Hey, I think you should consider ECT/residential treatment/etc.""  And sadly, some of your patients will die of their diseases.   A lot of being a doctor far beyond just knowing not just what drug goes to what disorder, but anticipating things like medication reactions if you know a patient is sensitive to drugs in a certain category, doing the balancing act of treating multi-diagnosis cases, and not being afraid to refer out and think outside the box, even if it's not what the textbook tells you."

Not that their problems aren't real, but it can be frustrating reading their posts sometimes like when they refuse to seek help, etc.   Like OK I can empathize with you all day long, I  too once was a teenager and also had issues, which I dealt with by seeking help.

In my experience with mental health professionals ( therapist psychologist, psychiatrist, etc)  it's not usually that immediate a reaction.  Some might, maybe you've had that experience, which can naturally be very distressing, but they have ways of prioritizing who needs to be in the hospital, and who can stay in the community/at home.  Especially if they know you, most won't (dare I say shouldn't?) put you immediately in the hospital on watch for merely  saying something general like ""sometimes I wish I was dead"" or ""I have suicidal thoughts"".  Do you feel able to share that much? I know it's really, really hard to be open about this kind of thing, but it's hard for people to help if they don't know what's going on. They don't always react the way you're afraid they will. Tbh earlier this week I told my therapist about a near suicide attempt the day before, and she was surprisingly calm.  She did text and check in on me a few times later that day, and had me give dangerous items to a friend to keep. Point being, I went home that night like any other night and wasn't stuck hospitalized, which I'd been hesitant to tell her because of.  I think I'm getting to the point I understand that the consequences of not telling anyone (death) are much greater than the risks associated with being honest about my health to my healthcare providers (possible overzealous intervention.)  Being stuck in the hospital sucks, yes. I've been there before for days and I hate it.  But you will eventually go home. Dying, you simply have no reset switch. I hope you can find somebody to talk to, if that's a professional, a crisis line, a friend or family member, or somebody on here you can message."

Perhaps food is their self-medication?   That and obesity is something we are wired for by both evolution, and stress: long-term stress can wire the brain to prefer carbohydrate rich foods and changes the metabolism.  Mental illness acts as chronic stress on the body, causing the damages of chronically elevated cortisol, leading to aforementioned.

If this is all at once, you're actually on multiple drugs with similar mechanisms and at greatly heightened risk of side effects due to this.

I think you desperately need another doctor and, in my very anecdotal experience anyway, to probably wean off most of these, and see how you actually feel without all this drug baggage weighing you down.  Medication, or other treatment will probably need to start again *after* you establish your actual baseline state without all of this.  I'm not a doctor, I do noooot recommend changing any meds at all without consulting with a doctor on how to safely do so, but my inclination is once you find a sane doctor they will want you to come off of most of this.

Please elaborate if you want or correct if I'm wrong on any of that.   I was suicidal too in my first year at college. I had to change colleges, long story but basically I hated and was hated at my first school. I took a while off for my health, and then went to community college instead, and suddenly I could breathe again, and was able to get into a much better school on transfer application.  It wasn't that college wasn't for me, it was that that one POS college wasn't for me. One school that's a crappy fit and making you miserable is not worth this, in my experience.  If you're afraid, that's kind of survival instincts.  What do you have to lose if you listen to them, and decide to not die?  Is that going to be any worse than death, where, well, we don't know what happens there? Might hanging on, getting out of that crappy school by withdrawing, and meeting back up with your old friends not be better? Maybe you'll find the room and time to devote to your mental health, and figuring out (or doing, if you already know) what you want to do with your time and abilities? Gap years are a thing, a good thing, for a reason.  I really, really, really hope you decide to listen to the second thoughts you're having.  Your life can look like just about anything.

explainlikeimfive,f4yvilf,t3_dm957e,1571886365.0,"They eventually fade from memory and are gone. The brain does not hold onto every bit of info indefinitely, although human memory is theoretically infinite. (Theoretically being the operative word here; it would be horribly inefficient to devote valuable resources to saving huge amounts of totally irrelevant scraps of information). So our brain, as it happens, tends to remember better things with emotional relevance, memories that are more frequently of recalled, and those with a greater relevance/linking to other memories and concepts. Interestingly, memories with negative emotional contexts (fear, shock, embarassment, sadness etc) will generally be remembered more strongly than ones with positive.  This is believed to be an adaptive trait as negative emotional memories in our evolutionary history could mean learning to avoid predators, and be life-saving.   So what happens to ""delete"" memories? Synapses (connections between brain cells) are continuously pruned with those that get less use being eliminated first. If the memory was stored in a synapse that got pruned, oops...  I guess it's gone. Bigger memories, say, when you met your significant other, or your grandma's amazing pie, or something else much bigger and more emotionally relevant like that than dinner on some random night 10 years ago will likely inhabit more than one synapse, maybe many hundreds or thousands or even tens of thousands of synapses, and will remain strong for much longer than something completely inconsequential.  Memory kind of holds to the use-it-or-lose-it philosophy of exercising muscle to maintain strength. If you use or refer to a memory more often, or it is connected to other things more deeply, say your grandma's amazing pie, which might be connected to lots of family memories, happiness and nostalgia, and the smell of her pie, and the crazy hijinks you and your cousins got up to during Christmas gatherings--all that stuff it's connected to helps sort of root it in place in your memory.   Small stuff without an emotional context or other relevant details will fade much faster.  Memory is also unexpectedly malleable.  If your friend told you about a supper on a night 10 years ago, in which she said you had supper together and ate at a pizza place in town and there was a roach in the pizza, you might start remembering the pizza, even vividly filling in details and images...even if your friend was completely making up this pizza dinner.

It may be that she doesn't realize, and is focusing on other things right now due to this, when focusing on your most immediate issues could do more to improve your quality of life.  Supposing for some reason even changing the focus of therapy doesn't help, keep in mind there's many different kinds of psychotherapy, and there's a possibility that the style she uses just isn't the best fit for you.  If you're not comfortable or feel out of sync with the things expected in her type of therapy, it's worth talking to her about it openly, and seeing if there's ways you could both maybe approach  it a little more flexibly, or if trying a different type of therapy with a different practitioner might be a better fit for you."

But most people who are depressed quietly struggle to go about their lives as normal.  When I was first told I was depressed I was really confused because like I still went to class most days, still went and did things with friends even laughed at jokes and stuff, I remember asking my psychiatrist ""but how am I depressed, if I still go to class at uni, have fun and hang out with my friends?""  He told me that depressed people do those things too, but that also doesn't mean you're not depressed.  I mean, eventually it may, if things get bad enough, like it did when I was hospitalized, and then you suddenly have another lay of reasons to be miserable like the massive neglect of responsibilities that creates a clusterf\*ck of new problems.

Exercising is good for you anyway, but if you're still really bothered by your depression/anxiety/etc seeking medical help and psychotherapy could do more to directly address symptoms."
selfharm,f48sdwc,t3_djmrrx,1571447560.0,I do that a lot.  Idk if I enjoy or it's just because they itch bad af when healing.  Hell I scratch even when they're pretty much scars.
TherapeuticKetamine,f48qu4o,t3_djqyaj,1571446308.0,"Ketamine's effects on average last about a week  following a single dose before symptoms return. Currently infusion clinics as well as Spravato advocate following a protocol of 2 treatments a week over 3 weeks to lift the symptoms and tapering back to once a week then every couple or few weeks to monthly to no treatments providing symptoms don't make a serious comeback.  Typically people are also expected to continue using traditional antidepressants and psychotherapy as well to help maintain stability.  In my anecdotal experience a full induction protocol  produced results that kept me in remission for 3 months before I started relapsing under stressful circumstances.  While ketamine can produce rapid remission, you're going to need something else to maintain the improvements, thus traditional antidepressants, psychotherapy, lifestyle measures, etc etc."
depressionregimens,f48prr2,t1_f48ilx9,1571445444.0,"You're right, IF your insurance will pay for the drug, but mine won't. It's like, ""It's not in our formulary, do this long complicated appeals process and wait 6 weeks. Oops, answer's still no.""  Insurance is such a scam getting to dictate whether you can have a medically necessary treatment."
depressionregimens,f48ph1h,t3_djvyuq,1571445208.0,That's phenomenal.  I hope it keeps working well for you!
depressionregimens,f45grzy,t3_djgb6h,1571376461.0," Manufactuerer assitance programs got me one insanely expensive drug for free, it's worth looking into. Per a google search, this is what I found for Latuda.  [https://secure.latuda.com/secure/latuda-savings.cfm](https://secure.latuda.com/secure/latuda-savings.cfm)  I hope that or something similar pans out so you can take it.  Otherwise, you may unfortunately need to switch to something cheaper if you can't get it if it's still too much.  There are similar drugs that may cost you WAY less that your doctor can write you instead if your alternative is not taking anything at all."
depression,f44yd07,t3_djfkr6,1571361630.0,"The depressive episode that eventually got me diagnosed started out a lot like you're describing. I went to the doctor's multiple times, had blood work and everything done, everything was normal, but I still felt like death, zero energy no desire to move, felt very weak just bone tired no matter how much I slept.  I'm not saying it's absolutely psychosomatic for you, but for me it sure was.  If they've done all the testing, it's likely they've covered their bases, and if you're known to be depressed, well... cognitive dulling, fatigue, memory issues, lack of appetite. Those are ALL attributable depression.  In severe depression people even move slower like it takes a lot of effort to move or speak, and may have a feeling of this great weight on their chests.  Maybe the treatment you need that will improve how awful you feel is treatment for depression."
TherapeuticKetamine,f44xdtn,t3_djfksq,1571360998.0,"Most people end up getting therapy from a psychologist, therapist or counselor, who does not have the ability to prescribe medication.  Psychiatrists, while they may sometimes also provide therapy, are the ones that are medical doctors who can prescribe medications. (There's like 2 states that are exceptions in which PhD psychologists can also prescribe some medications, but NY isn't one of them.)  So unless you locate a psychiatrist who offers psychotherapy as well, you're  unlikely to find both at one provider--unless you're cool with a psychiatric practice that employs both psychiatrists and psychologists.  Most psychologists/therapists won't have much if any impact on your getting ketamine, tbh.  Sure it would be good to have one that's supportive of that decision, but that's really between you and your psychiatrist, who probably isn't even the one doing the ketamine.  Ketamine treatment is typically either a nasal spray or infusion, both of which require you go to a special treatment center where they place the IV or give you the nasal spray...wait rereading, you've already had ketamine...I assume IV Ketamine?  I don't know how you find one that will write the compounded except start looking and asking, although they may get suspicious and deny even if they might otherwise consider writing it compounded, particularly if you have a history of drug use problems/self medication. This forum may have helpful answers although so far I've yet to find out how to get compounded ketamine.  Maybe put that as the title so people who know will comment? I've been thinking of asking, because to be real I'm sick of the expense and time suck of going for a treatment. I imagine many others like you I assume, feel similar."
depression,f44wk4p,t1_f44w99v,1571360426.0,"Glad to hear.  I remember at one point I'd gone off meds after doing well with my anxiety--then my anxiety came back horrible, when I restarted meds I was so confused I emailed my doctor like how do I already feel them working it's the first dose.  She explained that with anxiety anyway she's seen some improvement up front.  Depression though, per her and my pharmacology studies, requires longer for a (neurobiological) cascade effect to influence mood.  Placebo can work immediately though, and can add to clinical improvements."
depression,f44vuu2,t3_djczpq,1571359928.0,"Potentially a placebo effect, but in my experience there can be noticable effects early on, particularly for anxiety, due to the increase in serotonin.  The initial effects on increasing the availability of serotonin occur right away after ingestiong a drug once it's metabolized, proportional to the dose you took, whereas the actual antidepressant effects take a few weeks to start seeing them.  This is because the antidepressant effect requires weeks of the serotonin increase to start happening.  You may well feel a little better just due to increased serotonin even before the downstream antidepressant effects take hold.  Or placebo.  Or both.  Whatever it is, I'm glad you're feeling better."
depressionregimens,f402j7u,t3_dixdbn,1571283066.0,"Call your prescribing doctor ASAP.  While a rash can just be a rash, very very rarely, on Lamictal it can become large and cause blistering of large areas of skin, and be very serious.  Known as Stevens-Johnsons Syndrome.  If you kept the drug info sheet from the pharmacy it should be mentioned on there ie rash."
TherapeuticKetamine,f401inw,t3_diqe0d,1571282217.0,"After an initial 6 treatments, then 2 maintenance so like, 8 over 6 weeks, it held for about 3 months for me. Then stress happened and I needed another but can't realistically get them just whenever.  So back to the drawing board with other meds and therapy and crap for me. My clinic will not prescribe at-home lozenges unfortunately."

You got some good ideas.  Doing the things even if it seems pointless at the mo, coz lets be real it does seem pointless when youre doing it.  You're doing good at this. High five."

dxm,f3wh053,t1_ezn4scm,1571202169.0,"Considering it also happens with IV ketamine, I believe it's part of the NMDA receptor antagonism."
depression,f3wefzk,t3_didf45,1571199570.0,"God do we share a brain or something?  Because that's how I think, like, all the time.  Am I just stupid or am I so depressed I will never recover and be anything in life?  Has my hippocampus fried itself enough yet so that it is irretrievable and my memory will never improve?  Is my utter lack of focus and motivation in class merely a character defect or, surprise, depression? But what if I'm not depressed, what if I just want to be depressed....?  Interspersed with lots of ever-so-helpful suicidal thoughts.  Lmao.  My therapist has told me those are called self-invalidating thoughts, like where you try to make yourself feel stupid and small and at fault even if it's logically not your fault.  Oh and it becomes hard to distinguish whether these thoughts are logical or not, and painful to say if they are illogical because for some self-defeating reason or another, I want these thoughts to be true."
