For me, I started by leaning over the toilet for maybe 5 or 10 seconds. Sounds silly but when you have a fear of vomiting that's a position you never want to be in.

From there I moved to watching videos of people on YouTube (funny videos like gaki no tsukai or people eating durian fruit) making gagging noises. That particular sound used to be able to spike my anxiety so hard I'd have to resort to medication.

After that I moved on to monitoring my own body, why do I feel sick? If someone would give me 1 million dollars if I could predict if I was going to vom in the next 5 mins, would I say I was going to? Did I eat something my body didn't like?

I knew that my practice with extinction worked when a lady threw up next to me and I was like well... That's fucking gross and not omg she's going to get me sick."
