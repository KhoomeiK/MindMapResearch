* ""Attracting and maintaining such an enormous, highly engaged fanbase is no easy feat, and how BTS manages to do so is an ongoing discussion. While the group’s promotional photos, cinematic music videos and intricate choreography provide visual appeal alongside catchy songs, these elements alone are not enough to sustain the level of devotion the band enjoys.""
* ""That’s not to say BTS avoid tackling the topic of love—far from it. However, their approach diverges from pop music’s sometimes two-dimensional examination of the subject. Rather than focusing on external love and relationships, BTS operates within the framework of self-love and introspection, themes that are realized in their more recent albums.""
* ""In the same vein, BTS continually makes an effort to communicate with fans by talking *to* them rather than *at* them; they speak sincerely through their music and stories but also through [award speeches and mid-concert talks](https://youtu.be/a0uGwzb2sU0?t=68).""

I like this part especially: ""these elements alone are not enough to sustain the level of devotion the band enjoys"" because everyone can either try and be the ""next BTS"" or dismiss by saying there's some special formula or it was all a boyband-Kpop-machinery strategy or easily call ARMYs toxic fandom yet there was definitely something special about BTS members and Big Hit :)"

Going into depth about this, the song lyrics were originally written by RM and Suga about missing their friends from the past and the video had a lot of symbolism that may or may not be in tribute of the Sewol Ferry Disaster that happened in April 2014 but I think the reason it still charts is that it almost became a representative or a reminder of that tragedy and its victims and a way of healing too. Many of the victims were young high school students on a school trip and there was A LOT of government corruption, injustice, shady business involved. The parents and young people fought hard for the truth and justice which ultimately led to the impeachment of the President in 2017. The young people of South Korea since that tragedy is often called the ""Sewol Generation."" I don't like to link two seemingly unrelated things especially when it's a tragedy where people died but this is how I first got into BTS in April 2019. I first learned about the Sewol Ferry Disaster and watched all of the recovered footage of the students inside the ferry and all documentaries about it which were really heavy and learning about it profoundly impacted me and my worldview. I might've learned about the tragedy years later but I still felt grief and deep sadness and anger. Somehow it led to the Spring Day video to the fan theory video and an article that stated that BTS and Big Hit had donated to the families of that tragedy in 2017 and another forum that the father of one of the victims had tweeted about BTS due to Spring Day and how his daughter would've probably liked it too. The two are seemingly unrelated but I think it really helps people to never forget and heal and find comfort in the song and video."

I always blamed my parents and labeled them as narcissistic each in their own ways for their neglect and parenting shortcomings. I thought I had narcissistic ""fleas"" from them but the NPD traits manifest in me quite differently or in certain situations which made me think it's NPD and not just my parents or trauma or BPD. I had or still have an obsession with power and power dynamics and struggles which sounds very sociopathic without any context but I was tormented/abused by my older sister growing up and one day confronted her with a knife as a kid which completely shifted our power dynamic that day so ever since then, I've been aware of such power dynamics and feel easily triggered when I feel powerless or abused/victimized/cornered and am always defensive which often comes off as aggressive, hostile, overbearing/strong. The part where I feel narcissistic traits mostly is because I tend to compete with other women or feel jealous or envious and want attention from specific people or groups of people and portray a false sense of myself according to how I think society wants or expects me to be like/a version of myself that I think others around me will be more accepting of -- so I struggle with being my authentic self and accepting myself as I am and carry a lot of toxic shame and don't feel like I'm enough the way I am..."
