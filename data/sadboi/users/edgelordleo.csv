I tasted freedom, and become obsessed with it. Now I've realized that there is no grind, there is only what people say there is. So, I stopped subscribing to the grind and started giving a damn about the way I feel. Slowly, I realized, that more and more I started feeling better and better, and now I have zero tolerance for feeling bad, because I found out that I don't have to. And I love it. 

I can't push you to get there too, I can only tell you that it's possible. I guess I started by watching a crap ton of stand up comedy, honestly. I don't know if that could give you a lead out of hell, but to hell with it why not try?"

Huel,fq3j3r3,t3_gglgk4,1589066990.0,"So, I have chocolate flavored huel and I pair it with water and chocolate plant milk. The chocolate flavored huel didn't really taste like chocolate to me anyway with just water, so at first I went straight to using a yummy plant milk of choice as a substitute for the water. 

I soon found that I didn't need to use much plant milk at all to make a perfect and delicious huel+plant milk+water mix. I think the flavor, though not good by itself, compliments the chocolate in the plant milk really well to become an even more delicious version of both. I assume this may also apply for vanilla.

I also think I've gotten more used to the powder taste alone while having it alongside the plant milk. Believe me, I was very let down by the taste at first, but now that I pair it with mostly water, huel scoops, and a few oz of plant milk, huel has changed my life in exactly the way I wanted it to!!

I also perpetually keep my huel cup in the fridge, and clean it every two or three days, so I have access to a ready meal that is a little chilled at all times. I think the cold helps to make it more flavorful for sure, and sometimes I add ice cubes which are also great!

Also take heed to easing into the huel, I myself had a night of no good digestion when I had too much for my body at first even though I thought I was easing into it. Now I have no problems, and I freaking love huel!

Best of luck to you, hope this helped!"

Nope, not sorry, you're not taking the blame for a random ass virus that no one knew about until wayyy wayyy wayyyy past the point of your actions making any difference. And even still, it would not be your fault. You didn't kill anyone, a virus infected people and you were just doing what you do best, helping others. No one is blaming you, you do not have these passings over your head. And you know what, lucky for you I happen to be a death witch and I've got a dirty little secret: you can't leave unless you're ready to go. And that goes for you too, and you're not done yet. You're not and you know it. So how about starting with what you do best, helping people? Oh and, don't forget, you're a person too. So how about starting there?

Paranormal,fnbfkm3,t1_fmvow1m,1586814654.0,"Haha, well, the way I define it is PAN-theist as opposite of A-theist, meaning while an atheist believes in nothing a pantheist believes in everything. So, no matter what religion or belief system someone follows I believe it to be true (even when there are contradictions in the systems). A witch, on the other hand, isn't a term correlated to a religion, instead it just refers to someone who practices witchcraft. This person could be pagan, or atheist, or whatever, it's unrelated to religion, though usually witches are spiritual in some nature (though not required). I hope that helps!

modafinil,fmvir8b,t3_fx5180,1586418452.0,"Throughout the day, your muscles create toxins as you use them. These toxins are filtered out through movement and special systems in the body made for this purpose. 

Because of the size of the human brain and the extent to which it is used intensively during the day, this process cannot occur while you are conscious. It uses a separate system entirely. Think of when you sleep as like running a washing machine, your body is literally flushing out these toxins to prepare you for the next day. When you do not sleep, the toxins don't get flushed out, so instead they just. sit. just hanging out, killing your brain, literally, as we go about the day feeling miserable. (because thats the feeling of our brain dying) 

A brain that receives nutrition and sleep, on the other hand, is like a super-brain, making us able to do more in less time, as well as retain more with much less effort. Most people don't realize this because hustle culture encourages us to be developing Alzheimers and other horrible things.  

Not sleeping is like not washing your clothes or not showering. It didn't work out in the medieval times, and honestly its uncomfortable for everyone involved. After a certain point, you start to hallucinate, and you become paranoid. Do this enough, you're in the hospital or you're dead."
neuro,fmvhouy,t3_fxl9wd,1586417360.0,"Hate to be that guy but heck yeah it will. I think it's one of the reasons I developed bipolar disorder. Had to be hospitalized twice. Once for a month at the end of high school and again in college. Sleep deprivation also makes it extremely difficult to learn, which would be hell for medical school. The brain also makes up the sleep it missed, which is probably why you're oversleeping right now. 

But if you get sleep right, it's a fucking superpower. You remember more and get more done in much less time. You'll be ahead of the game because you're allowing your brain the rest it needs to function at full potential, and you'll be less likely to develop or exasperate depression. The brain is super kick ass when it gets the sleep and nutrition to fuel it right, but most people blow this off which is so silly.

I wish I had made sleep a priority all my life, I think I would have learned more and been a better person emotionally early on. Luckily the body and brain are really great at healing themselves, so if you can likely still take advantage of your real brain if you continue making sleep a priority. You're not broken, though your brain is definitely in need right now."

insomnia,fm7hx7f,t3_ftk8gk,1585827609.0,"Hi, witch here, so I may be able to help! You are an infinitely powerful being, what you say goes. When you sage your apartment, state your intention verbally aloud of clearing harmful energies from the space. Feel the room become lighter and warmer as you clear the energy. Know that if there was anything in your sacred space, a place where you live and thrive, it works for YOU and protects you. You hold the power, always, and you cannot be harmed in your place of power. It is silly to even think that, so we wont go there. Hallucinations are totally normal for insomnia, your brain is full of toxic bleh and it just needs a little shut eye to clean up the mess is all. Think of it like your brain asking you to sleep. It is valid to want to protect yourself and feel uncertain about letting your guard down, but you ARE protected just through the nature of your inherent power. These energies are just letting you know how much you care about your safety and wellbeing, which is actually pretty beautiful. But, they've done their service and now we can return them to dust and gratitude, serving your true intention of safety and a great nights recharge. You are not in harms way, you are surrounded by infinite love and power (and you ARE power as well) protecting you at all times, and you deserve a good nights sleep. So meh, we don't need these energies, they no longer serve us and thus we let them go. Relax in the knowing that nothing is more powerful and more deserving than you, and you will always find the most peaceful, undisturbed, luxurious sleep. Hope this helps! :)"

If you have ever read Sylvia Browne's ""A Psychic Guide to Our World and Beyond: The Other Side and Back"" she goes into some other very similar accounts of visitors from beyond, loved ones and such, so if you're curious I recommend the read! Spirits visit us often, and sometimes we choose to reincarnate to the same family lines, so maybe that is how she knew those other details. That is such a cool experience! Thanks for sharing, hope this helps!"

feminineboys,fc1u4zi,t3_ee2ei8,1577329795.0,Yeah it's super easy! I don't even use a brush. I just put a little bit on the top of my hand and then  mix it a little bit before dabbing it on my face. I love bb cream even more than regular concealer. It's great!
gaybros,fbyuvib,t3_eeqrp3,1577226965.0,Good for you and good riddance. You've created room for better people in your life.

death,fajjc82,t3_e9e64i,1576140655.0,"Though life on earth is a meaningful opportunity, it is the blink of eye compared to the eternal existence from which we originate. Eventually, you will receive death, just like we all will, but it would be a disservice to your being and purpose to cut your story short. Your boyfriend is gone and that is fucking horrible. I feel sympathetically outraged, hurt, and sad for you and your situation. There are no answers, and the only way out is through. But I hope you know, that as an eternal being, just like you, he's not leaving you here alone. Sure, his vessel is gone, but we here on earth have skin for our spirit, not spirit for our skin. If I had a guess, his essence will always be there when you need him most, and once you finish this small, small but mighty life, with however much time you have left of it, then you'll pass through the veil and wake up, having cherished every second of breath you had on earth, finally, finally reuniting with him and everyone you've ever lost before, as if shook from a bad dream. 

I mean really, we're not supposed to want to be here anyway, not necessarily, but we are supposed to try. And that middle line between wanting and not wanting to be here, making meaning out of trial, that is the beauty of life.

Keep an eye out for signs, birds, animals he may have like or known that you liked. Sunsets, magical clouds, it isn't uncommon for loved ones to reach out to us like this. It will probably be something very specific. 

But really, no matter what you believe, that really, fucking sucks. I feel horrible for your loss. I am keeping you in my positive thoughts. Please take as much time as you damn well please and ignore society's inept death culture. I wish the best for you."
