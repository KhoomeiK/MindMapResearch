StopSpeeding,fqqzzkp,t3_gke7py,1589575053.0,"8 years is an extremely long time of using a potent drug that drastically elevates primarily dopamine and norepinephrine.  However, chronic and significant elevations of these two neurotransmitters will snowball and affect many other systems - serotonergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic, Acetylchloline/nicotinic and endorphin/opioid receptors, just to mention a few.  And to complicate it even further, each of those systems is extraordinarily complex in affecting perception and behavior.  In other words, the “snowball” effect of this for 8 years is bound to have seriously significant impacts.  So even after your dopamine/norepinephrine have “recovered,” there could be detrimental neural pathways formed from ur usage.  You’re  likely dealing w/ some Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome.

Do you have specific thoughts/feelings that ruin ur mood?  Do you have a passion?  Good friends?  Sleeping well, eating properly and exercising?  Lifestyle/behavioral choices can affect neurotransmitters just as much ad drugs, and can also facilitate neuroplasticity.  I’m only 8 days clean, but eating healthy as fuck, sleeping a ton, exercise and overall crazy amounts of self care have prevented me from feeling completely awful."

It is almost certainly dopamine related, i would think (though not exclusively).  The constant state of boredom and detachment was, for me, induced after daily heavy adderall use and hours of porn binging, and of course that will massively down regulated dopamine transmission.  

Last exam is Tuesday and after that i am taking a gap year for certain.  I plan to do exactly what the “dopamine detox” thing you mentioned includes - minimal use of electronics/video games, no porn and absolutely no substances for 2 months.  Also planning to do rigorous exercise daily, meditate for at least 20 min/day, spend as much time outside as possible and be social once again.
