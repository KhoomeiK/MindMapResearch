That's a lot of new information for your wife to process, especially the part about getting more pleasure from men than women and opening the realationship up. You basically told her that sex with her doesn't compare to some random men from your past, and now she's probably having trust issues that she is just a beard to shield you from homophobia. Then to pour some extra salt in the wound, you requested to open up the relationship so you could play with other men. It doesn't sound like you considered how this would emotionally affect your wife at all. You didn't ask is ""our marriage"" is over and instead asked is ""my marriage"" over, for example.

So your wife (I assume) went from thinking she was a woman in a monogamous marriage with a straight man that loved sex with her to finding out she's probably been used for several years by a confused gay man that could have possibly been cheating on her (I'm not saying you are, but it happens) and may need STD tests. You've lied about your sexuality for years... how is she supposed to know you haven't been lying about your fidelity, too?

I think you should see a therapist individually before opening up the marriage. It seems like you are gay and are opening up the marriage to avoid coming to terms with that, and you should explore why you married a woman if you prefer sex with men. Nobody likes being used so your wife is probably going to need some time to emotional process everything."

They are statistically more likely to be a victim of a crime than a perpetrator, and it's socially acceptable to question their behavior or spread misinformation about the condition without being labeled a ""schizophobe.""

This is an example of the stigma I was alluding to in my first comment; believing schizophrenia causes violence is actually the main stigma against it. It comes from movies, and confusion with the drug-induced psychosis seen in homeless drug addicts.

And considering the general public is constantly told that trans people feel suicidal or will kill themselves if they don't get treated radically different than their physical sex, I don't see how you can logically say it ""doesn't hurt them or anyone else."" It is a socially disruptive mental illness that has been normalized in our society while schizophrenia continues to be stigmatized. There are studies showing brain changes in schizophrenia that correspond to activation in areas like the hearing center of their brain when they are hallucinating. So the fact that trans people have activation in the their brain similar to the opposite sex would be totally normal if it's a hallucinatory delusion in their brain."

It seems like a psychological or psychiatric issue where she believes you guys are meant to be and the stress of lockdown triggered it or something. My mother has schizophrenia and this is similar to some of her delusional episodes. There's a few people that have restraining orders against her for similar behavior.

If you are lucky, your coworker is high-functioning and may snap out of it or change her meds, but I would make sure you documented everything so HR isn't confused about what's going on. 

The best way to handle it is to stay calm, and stick to the objective facts about the situation. I find it helps if you're like ""X is a great person/hardworker/intelligent but the behavior Y is very concerning to me"" type of attitude.

She can't control the lockdown, but she can control if she gains weight sort of mindset. I think it's often an attempt to avoid emotional intimacy, too. Some people are actually pretty averse to being loved or trusting, especially if they've been abused or abandoned.

If she's recently switched meds, that might also be related,  so she may need to talk to her psychiatrist and ask if obsessive/compusive behavior could be a side effect. I've heard of some meds that increase dopamine causing compulsive gambling in people who never gambled before, and it sounds like the eating disorder is a new coping mechanism. So it could be a medication side effect, or just her suddenly having enough energy to act on a weight obsession.

Definitely encourage her to get therapy. This is something she will need to work through alone in therapy, so don't beat yourself up if you can't ""fix"" her. It's good to be supportive but you can't love people out of psychological disorders, unfortunately :("

You can sometimes bore them out of your life, and they will switch to a new victim who is more interesting. It's called ""medium chill"" or ""grey rock"" in a lot of abuse communities if you want to google techniques. I think fading out and then ignoring this guy is probably the safest option, though.

I think you should look up laws in your state or country and see if there are laws against revenge porn. You may be able to hit him with lawsuits and have lawyers get the videos taken off sites like Pornhub/social media. Don't tell him you saw a lawyer; he may be dumb enough to tell you exactly which sites he uploaded the videos to and your lawyer may be able to send out a few legal letters/emails. Him sending videos/photos to your family and friends may also be illegal under these laws, but it may be covered under stalker laws, too.

I agree with other commenters that deleting the videos probably is a lost cause. I know it's really scary right now, but it's actually good that he has a restraining order and documented abuse history because it discredits him. I think you might want to get ahead of the video release and tell your family that they may be sent graphic sexual videos/photos because someone is trying to blackmail you to stay in an abusive relationship. The power of blackmail is fueled by your fear of it. Save any texts or social media comments where he threatens to release the videos. Blackmail is a crime in a lot of places.

If you block him, tell him in a text ""I do not want you to contact me again"" and then begin documenting any contact (phone calls, texts, emails, sightings, etc).

Two people could both have severely abusive childhoods but one person had divorced parents and hung out at the nonabusive parent's house half the time vs. the other person who lived with two abusive parents full time, as a theoretical example. That would look basically the same on a lot of the simple checklists mental health professionals use when they are evaluating someone for truama.

 I guess I should have added environment and culture as well, but that didn't seem as related to biology as trauma (visible brain changes in people with certain mental disorders) and genetics (chromonsomes, etc). I personally think social support plays a significant role in how well most people cope with psychological/psychiatric disorders. So that would be more of a cultural or environmental factor.

And schizophrenia is fairly genetic, so a sudden psychotic break in an otherwise unabused person is probably at least partially genetic. It definitely is more common in children of schizophrenics compared to the general population. And that could also explain why some people come out of abusive situations fine as well.

science,fq7zwrh,t1_fq7todw,1589155651.0,"I don't know. She's been psychotic ever since I can remember so it seems pretty normal to me. Lol.

It's too complicated to expain in one comment, honestly. I would need to write a book or something."
stimuluscheck,fq7qsua,t3_gh0k7q,1589150325.0,Same. I'm still in the PSNA club :(
todayilearned,fq7qe9f,t3_ggd8vn,1589150093.0,Crows are so cool.
science,fq7pu1x,t1_fq7mqle,1589149775.0,"Yeah, I've swung before and I prefer how honest about the realities swingers are. There's only so much time, money, and emotional energy to go around. A lot of poly people are like ""love is infinite"" but time and money sure isn't, lol.

I'd rather know it's a hierarchy going into the situation than have someone tell me I'll be as valuable as their other partner when actions don't back that up in reality. It lets you downgrade your expectations to a realistic level based on what the other person can realistically offer you."
China_Flu,fq7pa4l,t3_ggxmkl,1589149463.0,"Yeah, I got sent home three times when I was having some type of neurological issue. Apparently it acts up in the heat, but I still don't know what is wrong with me. American healthcare is a scam."
China_Flu,fq7p1ib,t3_gh7aia,1589149368.0,Hella cool. Team Fox!
science,fq7nq8d,t1_fq7lys5,1589148855.0,"Yeah, I've been a secondary, too. I don't date poly couples anymore because the secondary relationship can't progress without significant changes to the couple's relationship dynamic. So it's like being in a FWB situation forever. Most of the practical benefits of being in a relationship remain between the primary couple.

I think it's a good relationship style if you want a more casual relationship but it's a dead end if you want to build a longterm relationship you can depend on for anything more than emotional support and sex."
science,fq7m6bz,t1_fq736r1,1589148247.0,"Yeah, I prefer to think of it as a wiring difference. People's childhoods amplify the genetic predispositions they were born with. Than we label different symptom constellations as different disorders to describe what is observably ""wrong.""

My mother has schizophrenia and it's not really that related to emotions, in my opinion. She's just very emotional because she has a very stigmatized disorder and people are discriminatory. Nobody thinks twice about being rude or worse to schizophrenics. And it's hard to understand even for people that are trying to be nice.

It's more of a ""sensory filter"" problem. And I personally think it's related to REM sleep because two out of four of her kids have sleep disorders. So I think my mom's brain is dreaming while awake. Like most of her behavior makes sense when you think about how strange dreams can be."
science,fq6wfjd,t3_ggw1ak,1589138717.0,I feel for people with brain cancer. I have bipolar disorder and the social cost of losing control of yourself is worse than the disorder itself. I don't blame them for wanting to end things on their terms.
science,fq6vy36,t3_ggz1rf,1589138537.0,Trauma and genetics. That's basically the two causes of all psychological and psychiatric symptoms. The diagnoses are more like descriptive labels.
science,fq6vgdp,t3_gh21v2,1589138360.0,I wonder how satisfied the secondary partners feel. It's widely known that couples often prioritize their relationship survival over the second partner's relationship satisfaction.
bipolar,fq5d2l7,t1_fq4o7z7,1589100757.0,"Me, too. Its nice to talk to people that get it."
todayilearned,fq3yzjp,t3_gggj5h,1589071883.0,That's really interesting
bipolar,fq30fi5,t1_fq2p0jo,1589061867.0,"Very true. I was closed off before my first psychotic episode and have been working on ""shutting down"" again, and dusting my old mask off, lol. I think when you wear a mask you can be very zen about the imperfect love people offer you than when you are raw and vulnerable.

I also agree it can be quite fun! We might as well enjoy ourselves since none of us are getting out of this life alive anyways 🤣🤣🤣"
politics,fq2iw1q,t1_fq0pf0b,1589056567.0,"I still haven't gotten my check and I don't care if middle class people like you get an extra $1200 or $2000. You could also spend it to stimulate the economy or something, but it's better a middle class person accidentally gets $2000 than a poor person gets nothing in some outdated bootstraps moment.

You shouldn't feel guilty. Corporations are running away with trillions."
politics,fq2ex1z,t1_fq0qtla,1589055485.0,Totally agree.
bipolar,fq2d81n,t3_ggkprf,1589055021.0,"I feel this. I had my first manic/psychotic episode when I was 27 and my life fell apart. I think fully accepting that normal may look different for you is important. I found therapy helpful with this because friends and romantic partners tend to bail if you are bipolar, or stick around and act like martyrs or something.

I never found therapy helpful before my episode but now I feel like some of the therapists I've talked to are the only people I can really be honest with. Adjusting to bipolar is really hard, so it's good to have a nonjudgemental person that doesn't need to be emotionally catered to in a ""normal"" way to talk to about everything."
bipolar,fq26m8u,t1_fq1z9tv,1589053299.0,"Right? Like I'm not proud of my bad side, but it is still a part of me so you're not really loving the ""real"" me if you try to pick and choose what parts of me you love."
