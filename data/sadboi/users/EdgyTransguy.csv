It took me MORE than another 14 years to overcome it, and it wasn't by myself, but thanks to a whole year on meds and then therapy just to be able to slowly start to function as a person again.
I think is great and amazing that most people seems able to cope well and relatively soon. Otherwise mankind would have already dissapeared. 
But for some of us, a part of our soul breaks when a beloved one dies, and we need a lot of support and professional help to put the pieces together again, if even, because severe  depression is the kind of illness which untreated, leads a lot of people to suicide."
