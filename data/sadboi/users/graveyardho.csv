AbstractArt,fqu2b2n,t3_gkxr1b,1589650649.0,"Hi! I do a lot of fluid pours in my art. It's really easy, if you know what to do. 

The paint has to be thinned out so it can flow better, so you need a medium. You could choose something like a pouring medium, but I use floetrol. You can find it in the paint section of any hardware store. Using water wouldn't work, because acrylic paints are water based, so adding water would destroy the binder in the paint. Floetrol or Liquitex Pouring Medium are your best options right now.

Also, you'll want to use acrylic paints. They're the cheapest and super pigmented. I personally prefer using craft acrylics in my paintings, they're easier to dilute, but you can use tubed as well. I'd recommend against using hard body acrylics, they require a LOT more floetrol to get them to be the same viscosity as the craft paint.

People usually start with a 1:1 ratio of paint to pouring medium but I like doing 1:2 paint to pouring medium.

Good luck!"

Sure, no one signed up for online classes, but you already paid for them, and the time has passed for you to get your money back either way. Going to the dean isn't going to do anything, it isn't going to change anything, it'll just make people remember you as the guy who threw a fit during a time where everything is already stressful.

I'm the girlfriend of a very popular YouTuber/streamer as well, so I completely understand. My boyfriend spends 8-10 hours a day working, streaming, editing.

I think you should talk to him, tell him that you support his work but you want to be able to spend more time with him. If you don't communicate, he'll never know.

It's not as simple as ""stay at home if you're sick"", because people can COVID without having developed symptoms yet, and some people never DO develop symptoms. If EVERYONE  just stays HOME for a month, all at the same time, it would IMMENSELY help slow the spread. But it's people like the protesters that are insisting on going out, acting like their ""rights"" to go to movies and restaurants, that are making this so much harder. This is not just ""the flu"". You are not more important than anyone else. Do your part and stay home, so that the essential workers are less likely to catch it and unknowingly spread it as well."
