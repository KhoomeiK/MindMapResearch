For me, I was always among the top of my class, but also lazy (classic underachiever). Now at university I'm just not smart enough to be in the 'genius' category for whom things work out because of their wonderful ideas, nor am I sufficiently motivated to make it work another way. Anyway over time I'm getting better accepting things and become more laid back. Good luck to you."

worldnews,evpjicd,t1_evp9whg,1564674733.0,"Good point that a vessel could accelerate itself when slowing down others. I'm new to radiation pressure, but I can imagine that alpha centauri's radiation can be used on the solar sail to counter the laser's effect. So the permanent vessel can stay in orbit. Might be that you need more than one to create enough slowing force yeah. But you could also apply less force over a longer time. If e.g. the acceleration laser from the earth is on for a day, you could spread slowing down out over a longer time, proportional to the ratio of force that a laser and a star can provide."

bipolar,eq3mrbf,t1_eq35pvi,1559758964.0,"I'm sorry OP I realized after reading another comment of you that stochasticity may be off-topic. 
But yeah we're in suboptimal Nash-equilibria very often because we don't know any better or change investments are risky. Our decision making, individual and group, is heuristic and thus we find local optima, not global ones. So prophecy can easily be discarded as lunacy.
Also hierarchies can prevent the 'lesser' rational agent from enforcing consequences towards optimal equilibrium breaking behavior by the 'dominant' agent (look at climate change e.g., ironically it's fossil companies that can now invest their massive wealth in sustainability). 
I think in biology game theory is often described with hawks and doves and their ratio is never really balanced. But I'm going to read up on the new names you mentioned."

There's also always a path in which I'm opting out of suicide and so far, wel... I know it's irrational but I find comfort in the thought that my journey could have a reason or that our souls get to iteratively explore and select lives in which make fewer mistakes and achieve more. 
I studied biology and now bioinformatics and stochastic processes have found their place in my life there. If you're interested, look up things such as hidden markov models or evolutionary drift. You can make cool models of e.g. vegetation patterns over time or molecular pathways and I hope one day to be able to create epic visualisers for music with that."

bipolar,epfagyz,t3_bup3ue,1559193329.0,"I get it and am in no way promoting substance abuse, but the struggle with this is real. 95% of the time you know what are bad decisions and genuinely want to avoid them. But there comes a time where a break from reality seems like the only path to bearable feelings. But ok, even during these 5% it's usually recognizable and inhibitable. Sometimes though you give in, whether it is peer pressure or a conveniently placed deal in the supermarket, it happens. Then after that the odds of making the smart decision are marginal and a binge is lurking. Only afterwards it becomes clear again what happened. No way that feels good and the consequences can be big, not even speaking about the shattered confidence to prevent future episodes.

Then the medication. I come from a loving family, but despite good intentions, in my region people generally don't 'believe' in these illnesses and this can lead to inner conflict about medicine vs willpower.

But yeah I still agree it's better to call out inappropriate behaviour, as it is in everyone's best interest. Felt the need to express this sidenote though."

Yeah I agree babysitting is not an option, it needs to be voluntary at all times.

True that everything is derived from nature somehow. Sometimes I would like to go into meditation and minimize my interaction with everything that can affect my mind (except definitely tea). But then that doesn't work and I believe there's a quick fix for everything. Coffee to wake up, weed, alcohol, valerian to calm down, ibuprofen to play sports with pain.

If I do get a diagnosis, it will be hard to stick with treatment because I'm deep down very used to the idea that we are in control. It sure is good for quality of life to take responsibility at least."
