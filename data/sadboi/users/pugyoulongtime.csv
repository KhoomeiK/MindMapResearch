People who remain quiet and go with their attacker (like if they have a gun or threaten to kill you) are pretty much guaranteed to die.

animationcareer,fqyymh5,t3_glga33,1589756810.0,"Honestly I find myself in a similar situation a lot. I've heard a lot of good advice but one thing I seem to hear all the time is that you should find something you like, you're good at, and you should just go for it. Most people aren't going to find that perfect match with a career and the more you try to search for it, the more precious time you waste. If you like to draw and you're good at it, and you wouldn't mind animating every day for a pay check, I say go for it. If you think it doesn't seem like a good fit and you're not excited at all about it, maybe look into other areas. Maybe you could try your hand at freelance work on the side while you pursue an animation career, then go full-time with it when you're making steady income?

Like for me I thought animation would be a good fit but as I've gone through more animation related classes in my degree, I've been leaning more towards programming or animating video games. Just find what gets you excited inside and go for it."

gallbladders,fq89ytk,t1_fq87h10,1589161520.0,"I don’t have pain anymore but when I did get attacks, I seemed to always get back pain, yes. My pain would be in my stomach, ribs, and back every time I had an attack, which seemed different from some other gallbladder sufferers? It was a stabbing, burning pain that would last between 12-24 hours. My final attack lasted almost 2 days I believe. Started about a year ago with the pain and frequency of attacks getting worse and worse. This was after a night of drinking during the holidays with family, also ate a lot of bad food. Since removal though (about 2 months ago) I’ve had no pain at all. 

I had no idea that back pain was an indication of an inflamed liver so that concerns me quite a bit. Thanks for sharing and I hope you find answers. If you’re not a heavy drinker, I would assume it’s gallstones or a blocked bile duct that’s causing your pain and liver enzyme issues. Do you ever experience yellowing in your eyes or skin? Dark urine, loss of appetite, or unable to go to the bathroom? All are dangerous signs you have a blocked bile duct and need surgery.

Until you can get help, I would recommend hot baths and heating pads on your back and stomach if you haven’t already been doing that. I would also maintain a low fat and no fat diet. Unfortunately I had no idea what was causing my pain and continued to eat food with fat right up until my surgery. I believe a modified diet might have helped me find some relief. 

Good luck & I hope you find answers."

doordash,fnlxftr,t3_g2gssw,1587061419.0,"It's so tough because all of my deliveries are ""no contact"" with customers explicitly saying in the notes to ""leave at door"", yet half of them come out and grab it before I can take a picture. I'm wondering if I should start taking a pic of the bag as I walk towards the house? I'm so afraid of getting scammed like this. I take precaution by only doing $8+ orders under 6 total miles and in more upscale or non low-income areas. It seems like this happens to a lot of dashers though :/"

Fitness,fn7x1hm,t3_fzu5g1,1586729350.0,Does anyone know of some beginner arm/leg workouts that don't involve the core/stomach? I just got surgery a few weeks ago and am okay to workout again but I was told not to workout my stomach for a while until I heal. Any ideas?

1200isplenty,fmzzgu6,t3_fyckyi,1586532611.0,It's so true. I was doing well for a few weeks and decided to have something bad yesterday and felt so exhausted after. Took a nap and threw off my sleep schedule. It ain't worth it! I also gained half a pound :(
