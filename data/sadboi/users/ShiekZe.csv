raisedbynarcissists,fqx75c3,t3_gl32t9,1589727281.0,"It may sound weird, but this process reminds me of what I’ve seen with the process of addiction. You go back to the addiction, because healing is like waves. But each time you get back on track it gets easier, but each time will suck, but the fact that you keep getting up says more about your healing journey than you realize. I like to call my spirals (I’m not good enough, I never will be, and I’ll always be a loser, failure, ect.)
I step back and tell myself that I’m flashing back because of an insecure moment where I felt unsafe, small, and alone.
I had a moment yesterday. I told myself to listen to myself. Which is hard to do. To say to myself stop doubting and do what you need to do. 
I go back and forth asking if what I’m doing is right?
I try to mother myself, and reach out, and luckily I have people like my brother who check up on me, and I on him. Like when I start asking if I’m doing something right I go “oh honey, you know why your doing this right? You just wanted things to be right at home and you thought that being perfect was the answer. It’s not, and there is no right answer, and that’s okay.”"

AskWomen,fqn9ocx,t3_gjlqos,1589491034.0,"I guess I’ll add too. It’s been quite the adventure the past two years and so. I went to CBT for almost 4 years. I moved back into my parents with my boyfriend and cats. However between debt and work and dealing with being back home. I went in and out of depression and was on the highest dose of lexapro and even though I wasn’t spiraling like I was, I still felt not okay.

I assumed I would be dead by 25 because I couldn’t think of the future. I was miserable even when I was just trying to have fun. I’ve always been a shy anxious kid. Diagnosed as ADD as a kid. Somehow I found this artist on Instagram that made funny comics on depression that showed me a podcast called “mental illness happy hour”. I got to listen to so many people’s stories of battling mental health that I got more self aware of my own background and why I was the way I was. I ended learning about books that would help too through it. I learned about trauma, abuse, neglect, emotional incest, codependency, narcissism. All these little things I didn’t realize weren’t normal growing up. I was parentified by my mother because she didn’t have friends to vent to, and she would invade my privacy. She was cruel, and it turned me into a self isolating, and cut off person because attention from her was pain. So I identified attention with pain. 

Any who.... I was angry about it all. And regressed because of this information. However I did start exercising and cutting out alcohol and then weed. Did a lot of yoga and reading, meditating. I cut off a cousin who harmed me a lot as a kid and who I was close with. 
Then I finally had the courage to tell my parents my trauma with the cousin I mentioned. I felt like tons had been lifted off my shoulder. I kept it such a secret I thought I would die with it. It caused a lot of pain for me and confusion as a kid.

Then.... I ended up with what I would describe as a manic psychosis? (It was early April) Or maybe it was mania? Idk. I was just wayyyy too happy and then I thought normal events had significant meaning and ended up becoming super religious. I thought I had a special connection with god. Got baptized. Decided I needed to get married so that next May I could help the world end. Time went on and depression caved in. I was confused for months but also very scared. I ended up going to the doctor and she helped me get numbers to get insurance because I turned 26 when this went down and didn’t get insurance in time. I got medicated, and even though the medication really helped I became deeply depressed because of all I had done. Luckily I talked it out and got a therapist that does EMDR and it got better. I wish I had mood stabilizers years ago. I feel normal now. 
I moved out. I have my own apartment with my cat. I’m trying to go back to college, and I just know now that it’s going to be okay. Even if it isn’t. 
I really had to own my gut feelings. Like a great book I read .... “The body keeps score”.
Our gut knows what our minds forget.
Depression has biological roots so even though people say “exercise, and eat well!” It’s kinda a slap in the face. Like yes that can help. A lot of men with depression become gym junkies. And have to keep it up to keep it at bay or they just ignore the problem even if it continues. We have to face our depression head on. 
You have to have a team around you. It sucks, but it helps to be vulnerable with your PCP, therapist, and NP or psych. 
For people with bipolar they say it takes 7 years for a diagnosis. 
It’s so complicated, and I feel very grateful that I put in the work that felt like I was running in circles with. 
I had to really get in touch with a girl that got put aside years ago to do “what was expected” through a dysfunctional narcissistic family.
Own your truth, own your gut feeling, trust yourself, and be honest with doctors or get new ones."

I say a trauma therapist because if you have been neglected or experienced trauma they are the way to go.

There is hope. I’m 26 and I am going back to college to do something better than my line cook job after a terrible year of mental health struggles. We have time to turn things around even if it doesn’t seem like it (because depression lies, robs us of energy and motivation)

Psychosis,fpar9ap,t3_gc91r5,1588454048.0,"I was like this after I realized what I had on done while psychotic, and the meds I was having to take. I hated taking the anti depressant I was on and constantly tried to get off. Of course I ditched it during psychosis because I thought meds were evil. 
These feelings are temporary. I promise, but you must reach out. I ended up telling a lot of people I knew I needed too. Mainly my doctor and therapist and nurse practitioner. I read and watched on YouTube a lot about psychosis and narcissism and abuse.
It reminds me that this is not my fault whether this came about because of my upbringing or genetics, or just too much stress. 
I came to realize that I needed a lot of change in my life. Especially when my doctor told me I need to take toxic people out of my life. Which I have distanced myself from. Though it was hard as they were taking care of me and it’s hard to label people toxic that are close to us. But I do t need any delusions fed.
I’m in a little apartment now with my cat. I’m alone, but I feel safer and I feel like it’s going to be okay. Even if it’s not. Maybe it’s the med combo I’m on, or the change in environment and self confidence I’ve slowly built, and maybe the years of therapy. 
I stopped for now, but EMDR therapy was very helpful to my getting better. It showed me a lot that I didn’t realize I was carrying. Our minds kinda shove painful things down so we can survive. 
If you want a cool book to read. A book called hallucinations by Oliver Sacks (I listened to it on audible) is very interesting and very eye opening on all the different ways people hallucinate and how crazy lengths our brains go to try and protect us even if it has consequences. I read it after my psychosis because I really wanted to understand more. It also helped ground me a bit from my religious delusions.

I still get depressed and anxious, but it seems as though it doesn’t dip as far down as it used to. Though during these times right now it’s still very hard, and I can imagine how hard it must be for you dealing with these feelings. Don’t stop venting about it if it continues. Venting is good, and No it doesn’t have to be worse to feel this way. 
Emotions are energy in motion. It’s a way of processing our “reality”in the moment. Whether internal or external. Your feelings are valid and you are not alone. I’m sure many more of us deal with this. It fucking sucks to take these pills. If it’s for the best though then we must make peace with that. Our minds can be as flawed as any organ and that’s why this sub exists.
Hugs, it’s not an easy process friend. I grieved for many months, and that grief led to more grief and realizations that lead to peace, but it takes time and help."

I was deeply upset after I came out of it and then read books on hallucinations by Oliver sacks. We totally would repeat everything like we still do today when uneducated. 

I came to this conclusion early on and I honestly can’t remember how. I just somehow figured that if there is a truth then everyone everywhere would find it. Which made Jesus only preaching to a specific time period to a specific group.... I was like what about the east? The west? Why wouldn’t God reveal himself to them too? 

Though while a bit psychotic I found “stories” similar to Christ which is a sacrificial compassionate person who dies fighting passively while giving their all. Can’t remember what but I found it interesting that we put these stories on pedestals. Like the ultimate selflessness.

But children are selfish right? We have to put them in their place.... we must force them to be selfless because their “actually still growing object constancy and growing in their own awareness while the ego actually protects them as they become more self aware. Trauma actually hinders this by creating a bigger ego to protect them from the trauma inflicted”

But what do I know? I’m just glad I got help or I would still be in a Pentecostal church speaking tongues and saying things in Jesus name. I learned a lot from my mental breakdown surprisingly."

It has saved me from a lot of arguments. I think we trigger each other more than we realize. My family was always very reactive. Something was always ""funny"" even when it was more of sarcasm or subtle bullying. I still see it in myself and my siblings. Your mom isn't on any medications that may be overly producing the effects of alcohol? I'm on a mood stabilizer and I can only drink a little now. 

We can't change people, but we can change how we interact with them. Which also means accepting that they will react to us in the ways that they will.

Like you said that she keeps doing this. Try  nonreactive responses, and I know there are a bunch of youtube videos on this method. Otherwise its like groundhogs day over and over. 

There's a great book called ""stop walking on eggshells"" by randi kreger and paul T Mason. I listen to audio books on audible so that I don't have to have the physical book with me to start any drama. I'm a fellow chef too, and I to am okay sitting here collecting because I never do, and your right that its for the best and safety of others. 

Idk if you've done any boundary work, but emotional boundaries are important as physical. I used to love working the night shift so I didn't have to deal with anyone when I got home, but sadly used a lot of that time to drink. 

I had to read a lot about boundaries, emotional intelligence, and funny enough reading books on childhood like  ""for your own good"" by alice miller has taught me a lot about the psyche of kids that has made it easier to understand people so that I don't waste my energy on arguments, as well as validate my own inherited flaws. 

idk if you've stumbled on the narcissistic parents sub, but some of the stories have left me feeling validated, and it might fit with you.

CatAdvice,fo2f04s,t3_g57v3s,1587459873.0,"My parents adopted two boy cats though one passed because of kidney failure of some sort. However the father was feral and the cat grew up to be a big cat that loved to hunt. I honestly don’t know if he was neutered because my parents were cheap.
Our girl cat who we had originally disappeared for a week. I was so worried when we saw her in the neighbors drive way walking towards home. 

My dad saw and got me, and before she even got in the yard the other cat chased her off.
I found she had been hiding under the neighbors deck. I wrapped her up and brought her home and she didn’t go outside after that.
If she did she stuck to the porch and eventually we got rid of the other cat because my parents were irresponsible about owning a cat and never did their research on cats and how to introduce them and raise them. And my mother was never a fan of taking care of the cats.
So I would definitely check with the neighbors, and shoo the other cat away. If this cat is a stray or even a feral some shelters may be able to help you. 
I found when I worked for a shelter we got a lot of people who just had questions about cats. So even contact your local shelter if you have no luck. I hope all turns out okay. Kitties are quite resilient, but it’s still so scary to not know where they are."

I had to stop because of everything going on, but the couple memories I got to process has helped me have so much more insight and I have much less negativity than I did. This was after years of therapy that didn’t do to much. 

Also have you been over at the narcissistic-parent sub. You would fit right in. Gave me a lot of validation, because it sucks having your head filled with projections from people who brought you into this world like you had a choice in the matter.

I had a tough conversation with my doctor about cutting toxic people out of my life... It’s hard because you know they don’t see how toxic their beliefs and actions are, but if they aren’t a good influence on you then it’s okay to say goodbye.

Toxic is a harsh word, but would you deteriorate your health by keeping them around? That’s how I like to think of it. It’s about your mental health and the effects certain people may create. No one is worth deteriorating your own health. 

So ...no you don’t know your toxic when you are, and the best thing is to be self reflective, seek therapy if you notice you struggle keeping relationships or burn them. Either side of the coin therapy can help. 

Do you gossip? Do you like your friendships? Do you talk about yourself the whole time? Do you listen? Do you empathize? Do you cross boundaries? Do you pry? Give unsolicited advice? Take more than you give? Do you manipulate people to give you attention with sad stories? Is your friendships surrounded by a drug of choice? 


They say your 5 friends make up who you are. So keep an eye out for your friends behavior as it’ll let on to your own. That’s helped me a lot though it’s not fun to do it does help. Denial is a hell of a drug that’s for sure."

AdultChildren,fncmeky,t3_g0up6j,1586840537.0,"My mom came from an alcoholic family system. One sibling became an alcoholic, and one a drug addict for a while, and most became codependent, and most of them very narcissistic. They end up with controlling partners, and recreate generational trauma. Yes you are doomed to repeat the pattern unless you look deeply at the pattern and why it occurs. It reminds me of that song Sweet Dreams.

 Some of them want to use you  
Some of them want to get used by you  
Some of them want to abuse you  
Some of them want to be abused. 

I found a good quote not too long ago that says ""Chemistry is really familiarity"" So through trauma bonds we form through our parents we end up with friends and lovers that are either one sided or manipulative and abusive. As children we learn to rationalize the abuse of our parents to protect them in our little brains. It teaches us to keep secrets, and blame ourselves.

However there is a light in all of these because through education on some great books out there, and youtube channels, therapy (i would recommend EMDR because I'm sure most of us has ptsd (my mother did and passed it onto me dealing with both her and my Dad's fits)) And EMDR reprocesses memories so that you can move forward. I cried during a session because I realized from an early age I had impressed on me that I needed to save my mom. Also the ""I'm not a good person, and I don't deserve good things, or I'm not good enough"" this process helps eliminate it and process in ""that I am good enough"".

It's not alcohol at the end of the day. It's the set of toxic behaviors that get rationalized. My parents weren't alcoholics, but Very religious and here I am because my journey lead me here to heal. It's about control and not listening to our most powerful tool which is our gut instinct.

I've had to read so much on manipulative behavior, personality disorders, compassion, learning the skills I need to break the cycle and knowing I will fail and try again without beating myself up. I didnt even want kids because I didn't think I could do better than my mom when I had so many qualities of her and my Dad. However I know realized that as long as I know what I know and accept fallibility, listen to my gut, build self confidence and comapassion and empathy. 

Sometimes I try to get my brother's to see, but they're older and one is in an abusive relationship while the other is a narcissistic CEO. I just know it starts with toxic shame and it ends in compassion. sorry for the ramble. I'm alone in quarintine after a long term break up and god does no one tell you how fucking rough it is to do better. as hard as it is to be in denial its harder to do things you realize you need after reading on how to be in healthy relationships. blah. anyways here my rant.

also... there is a huggggeee issue with alcohol as an accepted drug of choice for many countries, and its a huge problem as we as a species try to justify drinking it. If you ecer read the book Why We Sleep it shows how terrible alcohol is for our sleep. The author even points out that the only time alcohol wouldn't distrub your REM sleep would be drinking it in the morning. I abused alcohol and I feel as though its gotten better, but if I start having a glass everyday I better be taking days off to remind myself that its not okay to have a glass everyday. It's not worth the bs benefits they try to claim, and the ""drink responsibly'? bs slogan companies put out there. its infuriating, because they know that its an addictive substance and the majority abuse it. okay I'm done"

So now after years of hearing negativity from someone close your brain has a grove that deepens every time something goes wrong. Thus spiraling and reinforcing toxic beliefs about yourself. I ended up being told I had PTSD, and man the hyper vigilance sucks. I do much better now. Sadly though it’s not a quick change of thinking. Sometimes we have to find the root of the thinking problem to undo it. I still struggle but it’s gotten better each day, but it took a lot of time to slowly beat the thoughts of “I am not good enough” and is why I hang out in subs like narcissistic parents as a reminder that I’m not alone and things do get better.

I actually deleted Facebook because I grew up in a Christian school, family, and wanted to leave that all behind.

I think we even went over climate change which was actually forward of him to show us. I wish I remembered more, but I was pretty checked out. Besides doing my report on marijuana and telling the class how whether or not they wanted to have anything to do with the drug they would have to form a better opinion as in 10 years it would be legal.

If you can try and find a therapist that specializes in trauma. Wasted a lot of years on CBT to find out from my doc that I had PTSD.

There are many books out there on abuse that is worth reading as well to understand the neglect and abuse that plagues society. Alice Miller, John Bradshaw, and I definitely recommend the book out of the FOG (fear,obligation,guilt)(just read that one and it was right to the point, and a quick listen on audible)

I read a book on “why we sleep” and it’s crazy how much we need sleep. You could induce mania or hallucinations this way to into a delirium. 
Just don’t drive(if you do), and call a doctor and explain. If you have to have something to sleep it’s worth it. Then hopefully you can get it sorted out from there.
This sounds awful and I’m so sorry your going through this. Hugs. I’m glad you said something though.

I always had a rough time falling sleep, and even gotten myself a sleep mask. I’m also on an antipsychotic called seroquel that helps too. Even melatonin would bite back. I’m on it for not sleep related reasons. But getting sleep should be #1 then hopefully with help you can deal with the anxiety as well

Both of them worked hard to be middle class but my grandmother wanted my dad to be a doctor (like her ex boyfriend with the same name and occupation that blew up on a bridge in France) so he became the golden child and even today will blow up over little things. Loud noises still scare me as well as yelling.
I see them both as enablers and religious addicts. My dad gives a lot to the church and to his faith. Never to his kids emotionally though. Sometimes though. Like little nuggets of maybe it’s not that bad. But I don’t think I ever heard “I’m proud of you”

Learned that the hard way through trying to figure out what the hell this dysfunction in my family is that seems to keep trickling down. Oh depression and addiction runs in the family... mm oh really.... so does undiagnosed mental conditions... and generational trauma. 

Reading books on alcoholic family systems and realizing my role in it all even though I grew up in a religious household with a mom that grew up with an alcoholic, and my father was a golden child of a narcissist. 
Workaholism, food addiction, anorexia, religion. We take things to a level where we feel in control. We are not in control, but when we go through things especially early on in life we tend to cling to that controlling mechanisms to control how we feel and see the world. It’s why there is such thing as dry drunks and why I feel therapy and a healing journey a necessary for anyone struggling with addiction. It’s like tackling damage to your soul, or conscious. An emotional/spiritual wound that can be fixed with compassion, connection, and acceptance of our selves and our world. (And a lot of time, been in therapy for 4 years with a great therapist now.

I obviously feel strongly as I’m deeply saddened by the codependency and addiction that runs in my family. I always saw the pattern, but couldn’t understand it and why it kept playing out. I’m now medicated for PTSD and bipolar 1. I’m doing EMDR and therapy and it’s costing me a bit, but I’m sober and I’m also going back to school at 26. 

It’s never too late, but if you want to get better you have to do all you can. Reach out, read every book on addiction, codependency, boundaries, abuse, neglect. Inner child work, compassion. Find a doctor and therapist that will listen, and always remember that even through addiction that your mind and conscious is doing all it can to try and help you, but is failing for a reason. 

It’s not your fault, but it is your responsibility to advocate for yourself and do better for yourself. It’s a damn hard road that not everyone makes. 

You are not a piece of shit, or lack control because you’re an addict. You are a human being coping in all the wrong ways because you are not getting the help and support you need in this very isolating society. Look everywhere addiction is rising, and so is loneliness along with being in one of the most easily connected times.

There’s a good lecture on depression on YouTube under the Stanford YouTube channel. It’s long, but it’s validating. 

No you’re not lazy, take the days of, have some compassion for yourself, and maybe write down commonalities your noticing every time this happens.  Also sleep a good amount.

Meditation,fhhh6dk,t1_fhhd3eo,1581604112.0,I think those of us growing up in traumatic situations sadness can become one of our first addictions(food too) to comfort us from the pain. Like a survival mechanism we must grow out of these coping mechanisms to live a more mindful understanding life because all we know is inconsistency and painful interacting. I have ptsd and doing EMDR showed me why I was in such pain. I saw attention as pain and therefore discarded a deep need. Meditation has helped me see my social anxiety as a form of protection. I have many coping mechanisms that I am slowly breaking down to live a better life. Otherwise we will jump to different coping mechanism instead of completing the circle of grief which EMDR has helped me see. Grief is a teacher like so many emotions if we just ask why it’s here today.
adhd_anxiety,fhh9wgp,t1_fhfjy6a,1581598706.0,"I second the ensure plus. I had the same issue with food repulsions and these saved my life. Still lost some weight, but not as drastic without these. Wasn’t sure if I was depressed or what at the time, but it did pass, and now when I don’t feel or want to eat I grab a shake."

mentalillness,fh6wuij,t3_f1dydr,1581308151.0,I think it can develop in ways we can’t fathom all the time. Something in the water? Or food? Maybe stress just triggers a breakdown. So my answer here is yes. Genes are not set in stone and neither are we. I listened to and episode of mental illness happy hour that had a guest who had no trauma in her back round or mental illness and she ended up having a breakdown in her late twenty’s. Was even highly successful and her husband had to institutionalize her until they figured it out. Now she has to take lithium everyday. It was a rough listen. I wish I could post the link. We know so little about the brain even though we’ve come so far. We have a long way to go.
mentalillness,fgxdbr5,t3_f0lu7b,1581171564.0,"I feel you. My therapist used to tell me I needed compassion. It never stuck. There’s a good book called “Healing the shame that binds is” by John Bradshaw. A little bit religious, but good and to the point. “Healing the child within” by charles Whitfield, and “for your own good” by alice Miller (she’s amazing). I listen to audiobooks because it’s hard to sit and read these lengthy books. It takes a lot of work to heal, and books and stories help (I listen to mental illness happy hour (free podcast)that actually lead me to read so many more books from some they brought up)
I truly hated myself and even came up with the conclusion at 17 I was a monster.
I’m now being treated for bipolar and ptsd I never thought I would have. I learned I went through a lot of neglect and covert incest(where you get parentified as a kid). 
DMme if you need to chat about anything. I’m 26 now and work with a trauma based therapist doing EMDR and on mood stabilizers. It gets better, but it takes a lot of push we don’t necessarily have. Don’t give up, I know that hole so well, and there is a wall and when you get to look over it you realize it’s possible to reach. Hugs it fucking sucks I know."
CPTSD,fgux4hl,t1_fgujfbi,1581131408.0,"This though. Doing EMDR and it’s exactly that when I think about it. Just revisiting memories to help fully process them, and it’s been awesome and awful at the same time. Haven’t hit the hard memories yet, but I like this approach because you get the same deal out of it if your not able or can do EMDR."
mentalillness,fgrancw,t3_ezry8g,1581042197.0,"I guess to just do it. To be able to tell your story. To define life and it’s successes and wonders in a different light. To find hope in a place we didn’t realized existed? 
I’ve lived in pain for a long time, and through so much therapy and work I finaaly am putting things into practice. I’m about to be 27 and going back to school. I want to see if I can become a psychiatrist or really I would like to be a neurologist, but I’m going to wing it and see where I land with the help of guidance and my own wants and understanding I will change my mind. Why not though? I wanted to die for so long that I mind as well take the risks I can to push myself and not settle. I’ve settled so much.

Sometimes I imagine myself talking to my kid years from now when they ask how I did it when I reached bottem, and I tell them I never gave up and I kept learning and loving myself so that I could be a better human for them. I actually have. I plans of having kids, but I may change my mind if I somehow get my finances and life more in order, and finances bleh. My cats help too, they remind me that I’m at least here to take care of them."

BipolarReddit,fg5bgja,t3_ewr7ml,1580523108.0,"Aw man I felt the same way when I was on 25mg. It faded though and they upped it and every time they did I felt great, but it would again fade. I’m on 200 now. Doesn’t knock me out like it used to which I really liked because I have such trouble getting to sleep. Hope it goes well for you. I have nothing bad to really say about it."
CPTSD,fg13k40,t1_fg0r28f,1580420063.0,"THIS. fucking toxic positivity... aka denial of abusive people, and the damage that they create while people walk on eggshells around them. BuT ThEy'Re YoUr.... it doesnt fucking matter who the fuck they are. It doesn't even matter if it's me, because if I'm causing harm to anyone I shouldn't be justified, or enabled, or swept under the rug. I should apologize and change my actions and understand future boundaries with the people I hurt, and not expect anything else, not even forgiveness."
mentalillness,fg1090a,t3_ewb2pu,1580418428.0,"I've heard god awful things about mental hospitals, and god I am so sorry you've gone through so much. I fucking hate this system and I hope one day we turn it around because of the disservice it does in dehumanizing you and others. I got to hear a lot from the mental illness happy hour by Paul Gilmartin (its free too). Check it out if your bored, him and his guests have given me more information and understanding of my own pain/neglect/abuse than 4 years of therapy. They recommended books and I kept reading (audible, so listening really) and got so far in my healing journey without therapy. So I get where your coming from.

I'm really sorry you reached out and people called on you. That's not only scary, but that has to hurt your trust in a place you thought was safe. I finally went on my own and got a therapist that does EMDR and that had great ratings and reviewed her before getting and I've done more work with her than the 4 years I was with my other CBT therapist. 

I don't know what you posted before, and I don't care, and I hope that hope comes back to you. I know the feeling when its gone, and I know that no matter how much work I do that feeling will take over and nothing matters, and everything is numb and lifeless. I wouldn't wish that feeling on the worst of people. 

I also hope you find a safer space to vent. If you ever want any book suggestions or just an ear to listen (though I see your trust is broken, and understand you won't) I'm here, and I know reporting does more harm than good. 

I know it too well or I would be reporting my brother and his girlfriend for the sake of my nephews. The system is broken and the people are working in it is as broken and burned out as it is. Sometimes the only reason I keep going is to keep the conversation on it going to get awareness of how FUCKED it is.

I guess I'll end in this. Only you know you, and whatever you feel is best for you I hope you can do."
Jung,fg0sv86,t1_fg0rwqb,1580414352.0,"Very possible. I find my dreams to reflect the past at times or just the day I went threw and manifests itself in strange ways. 
Another point I put would be that just because we have even extend the outward anger doesn’t mean we ever got that justice or reaction we wanted/needed and it manifests to show us that we still want or need that? Just a thought."
Jung,fg0mjab,t3_ew6n7l,1580410786.0,"I recently had dreams of yelling at my mother. I’ve been doing EMDR and things have been resurfacing. I believe it’s showing our repressed anger from my own analyzing of why it would appear like that. 
We get to express the reaction we feel is pent up or never shown. I’ve always been a crier not a fighter. Trying to allow myself to get angry and use it as good healing fuel."
exchristian,fg0m097,t3_ew5bbg,1580410487.0,Literally how I came to be an atheist. Would it really be so bad to just cease to exist? I did it before I was conceived? And who am I to think I’m important enough to live on when others won’t be able to? It’s all fucked.
mentalillness,ffynmsw,t3_evoksi,1580350713.0,"All very valid points. My insurance used to cover it, but I have a public insurance and am paying out of pocket. She however specializes in trauma and EMDR and I am getting so much out of it each time. She doesn’t put me in boxes and humanizes me. So if you do go talk to someone remember they are YOUR therapist, your not just their client. This is your safe space and you need to feel safe, and comfortable and sometimes we don’t find it on the first try. With meds... like others said it’s all a choice and target may recommend it and you can say let’s try without, but again if you find a trusted therapist and you trust them when they reccomend it it may be a whole different scenario. 
I can say you may learn more about your strengths (being proactive in helping myself get better) and weaknesses (compassion towards myself ).
You also don’t have to go every week. You can go once a month or less if you need to. Or find community low cost counselors. Sadly you do get what you pay for.
My therapist always reminds me that I can call her if something comes up (I haven’t yet) and she won’t charge cause she says that dumb. 

My point in the end is that IF this is want you feel you want or need. Don’t let anything get in your way of healing and not letting big feelings run the show in your life. 

Also there is betterhelp I believe it’s called that’s online counseling if you have a tough time getting to an office or just want a different style of just emailing or texting, calling, Skype. 

I hope this helps at all, and hope you figure it out. I think your diagram was drawn out very nicely, and I would even pitch it out to a therapist of what you expect out of therapy and what your boundaries are with medication. 

Just reminder that you can shop for a therapist and even ask for a trial or pre therapy session to see if it is for you. I hear some don’t charge for that too. Best of luck"
insaneparents,ffuwtxf,t3_ev6plp,1580250854.0,"Honestly sounds like me last April 😂.

However I was in psychosis and my fire and brimstone friend lead me to her church and I thought I was a prophet. Luckily I’m medicated and staying the fuck away from those people."
CPTSD,ffur7x9,t3_ev6a05,1580247798.0,"Funny enough I was talking to a friend who was using the metaphor of needing to get to the bottom to push back on top, and that she hasn’t hit the bottom like she needs to. 
I was trying to tell her the goal is to float. 
So I used her metaphor to say “ okay well think of jumping into the water as any given event in life. That yes you can get to the bottem and push up, but do you really want to keep doing that? What if I told you that others have learned to swim and float and so the use less energy and power in the same events?
I asked her if she ever floated in the water. She’s like yeah as long as I can stand up. I was like well that sounds like a form of control to know you won’t drowned, but that by floating we use no energy because we let go, and that is our goal, and that is what we need to learn through therapy and healing. 
I also told her just because I can talk doesn’t mean I can the walk, but my point was let’s not keep up the same awful coping mechanisms and allow the same struggles to keep us in these god awful cycles. Btw I love your metaphor and now I want to send this to my friend too."
