AskReddit,etfioys,t1_etfgcfh,1562770560.0,"i dont think Spirited Away was meant for a deep story or a thick plot. it was meant simply to be a magical adventure where you put yourself in Chihiro's shoes and experience a world of unique characters. this movie is about growth, Chihiro started off as a sheltered girl, but through a series of events that each elicit a different emotion, she learns to be independent, and becomes a strong young woman. Go watch Schaffrillas Productions ""Every Best Animated Feature Winner Ranked"" and go to number 1. he explains it much better than i do."
