PlasticSurgery,f602s45,t3_dq1p3e,1572602410.0,"I felt really bad after reading what you wrote. It's really a terrible shame to be unjustly treated by the world just because of your genetics. I'm also considering plastic surgery and have been wanting to change my nose since forever. I hate my hair too and hate my stretch marks. I've been insecure about a hundred things around my body too. I hate looking at myself in the mirror and getting photographed and I'm always comparing myself to others. All I can say is, if my surgery is successful which hopefully it is... I hope you can get the same as well in the future. But before that perhaps you can change the stuff that can be more easily changed like getting a rocking hot body! I also hope you have lovely friends and family that support you :*"

BPD,extsdax,t3_cudabn,1566574083.0,I think it's beyond excellent that you are handling this so well. I have BPD and have had several extremely ugly break ups myself where I have lost my self respect because of my manic rage and poor impulse control and I only hate my behaviour after. You seem to be very mature and are taking things that are beyond your control in a very adult and self introspective way. Kudos to you! The road ahead might seem difficult now but this could be a blessing long term. And who knows what other beautiful experiences lie ahead for you! :)
