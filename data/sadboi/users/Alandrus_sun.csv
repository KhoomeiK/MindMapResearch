While people can be condescending and toxic, how you respond back is also important. Considering you're telling people that have more hours than you to seek professional help, I assume you didn't handle it well.

Edit: I decided to watch the replay. I usually like to give the benefit of the doubt. But you really did spend 30 minutes only top and in the jungle. You didn't hit a T1 tower once with your hero (literally 0 dmg) or even looked at a different lane once while alive. That's so impressive. I don't think I've ever seen that before.

This sniper is the only part of that replay that is noteworthy. His name is ""Goals to Herald"", he is playing like a noob but with a name like that, I can only think it's intentional.
