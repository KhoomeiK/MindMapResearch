My visa in the UK has one year left and we are both a bit tired of the UK and don't wish to pay the extremely high visa/ILR fees, and we don't wish to return to the US. I'm a little disheartened with my current role and having gone through some health issues because of it. 

It's been a dream to live in Japan for a very long time and it's something that we both have the ability to do. Yes, the JET placement is a concern, that's for sure. We would need to be a city. I agree with that. We are looking into all opportunities in that regard, so that JET is not the only option 

I would like to be the one who gets the job opportunity, but each company/University I find wants somebody in Japan. I'm not that great to overcome this limitation. I've applied before. If she could get an English teaching placement, would it not be easier to begin the job application process in the country, rather than outside of it?"
movingtojapan,foxyl4i,t3_g9m02r,1588160548.0,"Hello, 

Thank you all for the links and the guidance. Even though she is overqualified for most of the programs like JET, etc, would it be good to go for that to gain Japanese classroom experience and more importantly, to relocate and be able to apply from Japan? I would imagine it's more likely that you'd get a job easier if you were in the country. 

Also, for myself, I see that there are a few Universities that have openings that teach in English. Thank you all for bringing this up. Would non-academic jobs also be an option? 

To boil it down I guess, would JET be a nice way to get into the country and would jobs be hard to come by for me once we arrive? I have a good academic CV, but I'm not sure if I want to remain in that field. 

Thanks again guys! Much appreciated."
