mentalhealth,fejup4t,t3_epjdcp,1579186274.0,"I get it. I used to (and sometimes it still pops up) have an irrational fear of Chucky. I had nightmares and was paranoid that he was following me, always had to check the shower curtain/closet, and couldn’t hang my feet/arms over the sides of the couch or bed for fear that he would attack them. I really felt stupid because I knew he wasn’t real but the feelings were so strong. 

Eventually, my paranoia dissipated (perhaps with time) and with the right cocktail of meds including an anti-psychotic (back then I was taking risperdal, now on ability). Know I am bipolar and still have swings but the paranoia is all but gone, I rarely get those feelings anymore. 

It’s annoying to know logically I’m safe but emotionally... not so much. So when it creeps up, it helps me to try and talk myself through it...reinforcing I am safe and taking deep, deliberate breaths. Saying ‘he doesn’t exist’ doesn’t really work for me, I think because the ‘he’ makes me think of him more. But ‘I am safe’ and ‘I am at ease’ or secure helps ground me and taking breaths calms my heart. Talking to others also helps ground me in reality, not about the fear but to distract and focus on someone else, to know I’m not alone. 

I hope sharing this helps you in some way *hug"

For me, if I can’t make eye contact or if I feel worse coming out than in, that’s a sign. I have had bad therapists in the past and wouldn’t want anyone to continue with one that was hindering progress rather than promoting it. It can be harmful to one’s treatment (even if they have all the credentials).

It isn’t always easy to catch it when it happens, but when I do I try to reorient myself to the present by naming at least three things I see, what I can feel, and what I can touch, and anything else I can sense around me. Bringing a greater awareness to my breath can help as well. It’s embarrassing but sometimes I have urges to ask people if I’m real.

I decided I was safer on my own but it’s lonely and I still do t know if it was a good idea. There’s so many books out there on how to ‘deal’ with people with bpd but not many specifically for those with it. I would encourage him to continue with therapy, but it will come to a point where either he won’t want to continue to inflict hurt/confusion or you feeling too much pain from it. It’s not a bad thing either. You have to do what’s best for you. You have the right to do what’s in your best interest. I would want someone to stand by and comfort me but not to the extent that it starts hurting the other. We have major issues with abandonment and will either lash out to end it or beg not to be alone. The choice is ultimately yours. Do you think it’s worth it? Is he actively working on the issues (no matter how small)? Are you invested in making it work? I would try to do more research and talk to him about it, if you can. Communication can be hard. Maybe write out your feelings out in a letter, that’s what I used to do because talking was hard at times. I hope this helps somehow. Just don’t give up too easily. It can get better. But please, coming from someone with it, put yourself first."
