depression,f81a03n,t3_dyazjo,1574157913.0,"I'm not in the position to give any advice yet, I'm a student 16 y.o wanting the same thing because I didn't want nobody raising fingers at my parents blaming them that they could've raised me better. They have raised to the best but, I have the same issues as any basic engineering kid I feel like I'm worthless and I'm wasting everyone's time and my parents money.
I'm not the happiest but I'm not gonna give up 
So I hope you don't give up too, whatever sorrows you may have will subside I hope you find happiness and joy in life ‚ù§"
