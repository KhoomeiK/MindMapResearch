BipolarSOs,fhslrbi,t3_f4gusa,1581862443.0,"I have Bipolar I and I am a psychotherapist too. As some people mentioned earlier, meds are essential. Meds do require patience though.  It can be a lot of trial and error experiencing different side effects and varying levels of efficacy until you find a combination that works for you. 

Aside from that Dialectical Behavior Therapy is wonderful for emotion regulation. Does your therapist do DBT?  It's definitely worth bringing up. It's a great therapy with many very easy and practical applications. Some people here have mentioned components of DBT like mindfulness and distraction.  The cool thing about DBT in your situation is that it also has an entire module on interpersonal relationships.  I hope that makes sense as it is early and my mind is a little foggy. If you have any further questions about meds (although I am not a psychiatrist) or DBT feel free to let me know.  Best of luck to you!"

At some point you'll have to move forward with your life, meaning forgiving yourself and moving on. It was an accident. I know that's not easy with your parents blaming you....it will take some time but you will heal"
depression,ffjljg9,t1_ff5ks3y,1580001019.0,"There are stipulations to confidentiality. Confidentiality can be broken if you are a danger to yourself or others. If elder, dependant or child abuse is suspected and a judge can make an order for your records. Outside of that though you SHOULD have confidentiality. Although it's also worth noting that the parent is sometimes seen as the client not the child."
depression,ffj2y2g,t3_etrutg,1579989059.0,Yeah....My family is in the dark about my bipolar because well they can't handle it. I think it's perfectly okay to choose who you share your struggles with. Ultimately you want supportive people around and if your family cannot be supportive as frustrating as that is they don't get the privilege of knowing you truly. Best.
