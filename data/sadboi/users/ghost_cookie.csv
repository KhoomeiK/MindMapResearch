My friends and I have been playing the same game for about 5 years. In that time the DM got married to one of the players, two couples of the group broke up, I got diagnosed with and beat cancer, two of the players ended up living together, another moved to China...

But dammit we still find a way to play Dungeons and Dragons.

I guess it sounds pretty bleak but being in our 30s now, I find it something to be proud of. The day we all stop playing DnD will be a sad one. If none of those things stopped us, whatever reason we end up not playing for will be pretty significant."
