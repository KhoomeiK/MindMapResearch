CPTSD,fpg3ytj,t3_gd2jzo,1588593522.0,"My entire adult life, my mom has had this running narrative about how I'm a horrible daughter and an even worse mother. She's used it to control me, and gain sympathy from everyone else.

I lived with her for 13 years after my daughter was born. She loved to claim that she was raising my kid, and allowing me to stay, too. She turned my entire family against me to keep her narrative going. I'm an irresponsible loser who runs everything she touches and only looks out for herself. If anything ever went wrong, it was my fault, but anything that went well was because of her.

It took me years to realize that wasn't the truth, and I'm still trying to push through the bullshit. We moved out last year and, unfortunately, the woman we moved in with decided to listen to my mom's story and side with her. She's a lot like my mom, and apparently my mother found a sympathetic ear in her. The number of times she's told me that my mom was right about me when I reacted to things differently than she wanted me to is insane. It's been a hard year, trying to gain some independence while being incredibly limited by the situation, but having the things my mom drilled into my head parroted by someone I barely know has put them into perspective.

Objectively, yes, I have my issues. I hate phone calls and have done everything I could to avoid them in the past. I don't keep the cleanest house, but I also don't trash the place. I spend a lot of time online, mostly because that's where my friends are, and it's been a safer place than the places I've lived. I don't like driving, and don't have a car because my mom wouldn't let me take the car that is still in both of our names. I don't make a ton of money, but I'll working on changing that. 

But... I also don't spank, yell at, manipulate, or emotionally abuse my child. I genuinely care about people, and do what I can to help. I tell my kid and my friends that I love them - not something I ever heard from my mom unless it was in an attempt to manipulate me in some fashion. I'm not perfect, but I'm not the bad person I was lead to think I was. I can finally see that, at least at times. 

We're moving out today, to our own place. No roommates, nobody to try to define me. Everything is packed, just need to load up the car, say our goodbyes, and leave. I know that leaving won't fix the fact that I still sometimes worry that I'm a bad person and a bad mother, but it's going to give me a chance to get away from the outside voices that keep telling me those lies. 

35 out of my 38 years on this earth, I've been a scapegoat. That takes its toll.

And I'm guessing I'm not the only person who has lived their life this way - at least, not here."

Thank you for going to therapy, even without your daughter.

Thank you for being willing to look at yourself and see how your actions affected your child.

Thank you for deciding that you could make those changes, to give her what she needs.

And thank you for allowing your child to come to the weight loss decision on her own, and choose the path that she wants to follow.

I know all of those things are hard. We all want what's right for our kids, but sometimes we get stuck in ""I know what's right, and that's what I'm going to do"" and never question whether it's really what's best.

It takes a lot of courage to admit that you might be wrong, and even more to decide to change not only your behavior, but how you think about things.

If you can - and assuming you haven't already - make sure you tell your daughter that you realize you were wrong. Apologize, if you're feeling up to it. It's a good teaching moment - letting her know that you're human, too. We all make mistakes, and it's important to apologize when we realize we were wrong.

If this isn't normal behavior for her, it could be that this isn't actually an addiction, but her way of coping with the current situation by hiding in the video games.

Children who are exposed to long-term trauma seek out ways to escape from it - sometimes this means reading or playing video games for many hours - if not days or weeks - at a time, if they have the chance.

With Covid-19 keeping people home, and making a lot of people continuously anxious, in some cases it can qualify as a long-term traumatic situation, especially as we currently have no idea how long it will last, so there is no escaping the situation.

People who have never before been exposed to trauma may develop coping mechanisms similar to those of traumatized children, including escaping their reality by engrossing themselves in video games. This isn't necessarily addiction - if the situation were to end, a lot of them would go back to their previous lives without too much problem (though there may be long term mental issues that we're not aware of yet.)

OP, what you choose to do with yourself is your decision. There are no assholes here - she's absorbed in her games, but you have to live there, too.

If you want to try to get her to bathe, see if you can encourage her to do some basic self care. If you can, try to be gentle - don't put too much blame or guilt into it. Encourage her to maybe set a timer to remind herself to take a break every few hours.

Edit: Might as well mention this here... I was *terrified* of this place as a kid. In part because, during a birthday party, they put all the birthday kids along the stage for birthday spankings (back when this was a normal thing) and had us put our heads under the curtains, and the animatronics were back there, and turned off, and the angles were weird, and I was scared to death of animatronics and puppets for the longest time after that."

We've already had multiple school shootings in this country this year, and it's only the middle of ~~February~~ March.  It's not a problem that's going away, and kids are right to be at least a little afraid of it, because it can happen, even in communities that are generally assumed to be safe.

I could see a 10-year-old making this comment. I doubt that they would have actually been constantly worried about it, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was at least a thought in the back of their head sometimes. And the younger generation's sense of humor tends to be darker than their parents."

Sadly, odds are good that the only thing she'll take from this is a dislike of OP. It's much easier to point fingers and say ""you made my insurance premiums go up"" than it is to say ""I made a mistake, and should avoid making the same mistake again.""

It does lean a little bit into ESH territory because of the way you handled it - your choice to eat in front of her instead of just not getting anything, either, is a tiny bit passive aggressive, but not nearly as much as her choice to try to guilt you into it."

My daughter's father was in a similar situation. He was raised by his stepdad from when he was around 5, until he was a teenager. Even now, he still calls his ex-stepfather ""dad"" - even when talking about him to other people. His mom's current husband goes by his first name. None of them see any problem with this.

This man raised you for a huge chunk of your life. He was ""dad"" for nearly a decade. That time doesn't get erased just because he and your mom got a divorce. Nobody but you and him get to define where that relationship goes now. If *he* wants you to stop calling him dad, that's something the two of you will have to discuss. But nobody else gets a say in that."

I'm moving sometime in the next two weeks. I've known this was coming for months. I've supposedly been working on packing this entire time. Seems like I've barely made a dent - and this is a move I'm looking forward to!

I get the same way with chores, work in general, hygiene... I know I need to do it. Sometimes I even want to do it, but it just doesn't happen, because it's so mentally and emotionally exhausting.

Sometimes it helps to tell myself that I'm *choosing* to do whatever, instead of that I *have* to do it. Sometimes I know it's bullshit. Sometimes it helps to break things up into smaller tasks, or tell myself I only have to do it for 5 minutes or whatever. Sometimes I don't have the motivation to do *anything*.

It could be something called [Executive Dysfunction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ5coA0tTJU&vl=en). It's not laziness, it's not procrastination, it's something else entirely.

While I'd really recommend seeing a therapist somehow, I know it's not always an option... Thankfully, there are a ton of free resources on the internet if you know where to look. That channel I linked has a lot of good videos, including information on CPTSD and other things, too.

I will say, though, not eating regularly could be contributing some to your problems. It might help to keep a stock of easy to eat foods that don't take much thought or energy to consume, or that you find tasty enough to be worth the energy. Even if it's just something like bottles of Ensure, or even hard candies just so you have some source of energy other than... Nothing. Your brain and body need some sort of fuel in order to function. Even if you're not giving them everything they need, something is always better than nothing.

Hope that helps a little."
