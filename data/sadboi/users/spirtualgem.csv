bipolar,fari0p3,t3_eah56k,1576316301.0,"I was diagnosed 2 days ago I’m also 38. It’s a lot to take in. But if I’m really honest with myself this has been 15 years in the making. Wrong meds, dual diagnosis. But finally they’re sorting my meds. Hang tight. Allow the changes to happen and be open to receive the help and support offered to you. I wish you well in your recovery."
