Outlander,fq9jahw,t3_ggu288,1589199891.0,"This is the first season I watched in ""real-time"" so to speak (I discovered this show sometime around Season 4).  

The finale was... memorable. The scene of Claire's assault - I knew it was coming since I had previously come across this spoiler - but it disturbed me more than I thought it would. I literally was praying for the episode to end with some closure else I couldn't stand it. And it did - the bad guys die and our heroine is safe and on the road to recovery. I loved the part when she questioned ""This is going to shatter me?!"" and refused to let the trauma change her. But as the immediate next scene with her breaking down reminds us, it did happen, and it was HORRIBLE...

Yes, it's just fiction. I suppose it indicates what a well-made piece of art it is, with such talent from all involved, that it makes me feel so. I love this show!

Favorites from the episode:

* Claire's declaration as mentioned above
* The 60's dream sequence with all its easter eggs
* Roger and Marsali dealing with having taken men's lives
* The last scene - ""Safe.""

I like the fact that I can relax at home with no FOMO. I dont want to stay home alone while most people I know go out and have fun, but I dont want to have to exhaust myself by trying to lively and talkative. I dont want to go back to chronic sleep deprivation and waking up already hating the day. I dont want to spend all morning waiting for the workday to end and all evening waiting for the next day to start. I want to continue eating when I'm hungry, not because its lunchtime or breaktime. I want to continue to have slow, mindful, energising mornings. I want to continue being able to enjoy my hobbies and entertainment without any guilt of wasting time.

This used to be believed in India (the four humour system was believed here). My grandmother's generation and prior explained menstruation as process essential for balancing the body. Menarche happened because once a child reached a certain age impurities in the body need to be expelled along with blood.

There still persists a folk belief here that menstruation is form of ""cleaning"", that the ""impurities"" need to be shed monthly. We still see few women who complaint that they are not bleeding enough or cycles are not frequent enough, the same way one would complain of constipation or reduced urine output. They feel blood gets accumulated and needs to be shed; and attribute other unrelated symptoms (aches and pains, cough, fatigue, vomiting...) to ""not bleeding properly"".

What does beautiful even mean? Pleasing to look at? Well then, not everyone IS beautiful. People have different opinions and tastes, yes. What people find most beautiful and most not-beautiful varies. But most of us would be described as ""average"" in this respect. If ""beautiful"" could apply to everyone, the word doesnt really mean anything.

Of course, the statement is likely refering to ""Inner Beauty"". But we have better, more specific words we can use - kind, honest, helpful, nice, sincere, caring, diligent, interesting, smart, skilled... And many many others. All of these have much better connotations than inner beauty (a phrase which, to me, always reads as coming through the lips of an ""aesthetically-gifted"" person, dripping with the condescension).

Personally, I feel beauty is given way too much importance. Too much fuss is made about how people's appearances are described. ""Unattractive"" does not have to mean ""useless"" or ""bad"" and neither does ""beautiful"" mean ""worthy"" or ""good"" . Appearance is just one aspect, there is so much more to each person. 

A better statement (to express to assholes that ""ugly people are human too"") would be Beauty isn't the only thing that matters."

Its probably because when talking to someone, i'm too busy formulating my next answer that i dont think of questions i should ask back.

This also happens with ""How was your day/weekend?"", ""How did you do on the test?"" etc (people usually want to talk about their own experience when they ask these questions)"
