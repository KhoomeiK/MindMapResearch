I'm judged for pursuing my dreams. Some of my favourite people are my artists friends at college. Those girls tend to have their family's support, meanwhile I'll have to change careers path because of family."

In some storylines, Galvatron is clearly just an upgraded version of Megs. In others, Galvatron is a totally different being, but has the memories of Megatron. In comics, they tend to be two very different bots.

As Dwight is informed of the trends of the first days on 2020 via fax from future Dwight (Jim still pranking him to this day, despite being in Philly), he decides to take action. 

He engages *Threat Level: World*, his survival plan. As he pulls out his artillery of weapons out of his desk, he calls Angela to meet him and help assign a weapon to each employee in order to train them (Hunger Games 2 style).
