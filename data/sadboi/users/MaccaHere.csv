jeffreestarcosmetics,fqwqqrc,t3_glbot0,1589714402.0,"Um, would you like to use more popular brand like urbandecay perhaps? They have many nude palette if I'm not mistaken :)"
BeautyGuruChatter,fqwn1u9,t1_fqtswne,1589710558.0,"Yup, and the gloss. I feel like his brand keeps disappointing since bloodlust launch. Wonder how well the sales on this one? Gonna 'sell out' in just few hours or so?"
BeautyGuruChatter,fqwmjye,t1_fqtzeks,1589710019.0,"Yes I think about this too. Like, what's happen with all this launches, is he that desperate for money? Is his brand not doing well in sales so he keeps doing launch like Norvina did?"
BeautyGuruChatter,fqwm0bk,t1_fqu6e78,1589709424.0,'Sorrow and anger'... what? I can't even
BeautyGuruChatter,fqwlni2,t1_fqtnoav,1589709030.0,Exactly my thoughts!
BeautyGuruChatter,fqwll5i,t3_gkw2q1,1589708959.0,"I find this palette boring and so.. common? I dont see gothic, thereare too many grey shades or is it just my eyes? The packaging is better than the last launch simple, efficient and clean but easily forgotten? This launch seems... idk, why he keep pushing for launches? Will there one for halloween too or sth for the end of the year? Isn't it too much?"
BeautyGuruChatter,fqwl8v0,t1_fqtnetw,1589708589.0,Yeah!
BeautyGuruChatter,fqr4v3b,t3_gkho2n,1589577629.0,Another one? Seems like nude palette?
AceOfTheDiamond,fp6c9ic,t1_fp1a0sn,1588349859.0,"Yes, me too! I wonder how they will face Todoroki then."
BeautyGuruChatter,fp5h393,t3_gaiw8z,1588329150.0,I'm so tired of him. Can he disappear somewhere else?
OnePiece,fon3lbq,t1_fombqup,1587911442.0,"Now you said it, I think so. But as I said previously, one piece doesn't care about romance that much so we dont know for sure?"
OnePiece,fom833p,t1_fom3pwr,1587881091.0,I can totally imagine this happening.
OnePiece,fom7u6m,t3_g88w5t,1587880876.0,So funny ðŸ¤£
OnePiece,fom7rhj,t3_g88yey,1587880811.0,"No, I think in One Piece they focus more on the strong bond of friendship. If Sanji married, maybe he'll end up with Pudding not with Nami."

BeautyGuruChatter,fo6jlsb,t3_g5ora3,1587560434.0,"After all of this, he will still has lots of fans defending his actions. With recents donation he gives, all will forgotten. It's so tiring, even depressing. Idk why people still worshipped this man, its sick."

AceOfTheDiamond,fn0b1p8,t3_fygfzl,1586538664.0,"Me too! This make me remember the 3rd year's final match ðŸ˜­ and the 2nd year's final match where Tetsu, Issahiki and others crying as they congratulated Kataoka-san."
AceOfTheDiamond,fn013mu,t1_fn000zh,1586533505.0,"Yes! This is what I actually think. Kanemaru still not strong enough, he didn't have strong presence on the field (yet), but we saw that he's good with juniors. I'm not sure about Haruichi, he has strong impact on the team tho. For Tojou, I think it will be quite good if he and Kanemaru work together to lead the team. But, I'm not sure XD 
Tbh, the new recruits shows more potential to discuss. Wonder what will happen to Yui, but pretty sure he will be captain once Sawamura graduate."
AceOfTheDiamond,fn003b3,t1_fmzy0nk,1586532956.0,Tojou is also a good choice!
AceOfTheDiamond,fmzzuvc,t1_fmzxufq,1586532828.0,"Seems so, I think Kanemaru can lead their junior very well. But I'm not sure about the others."

AceOfTheDiamond,fmomz5z,t3_fw7zd9,1586263807.0,"Ugh I know this, but I really didn't want it just end like that. I hope we can see how furuya and sawamura without Miyuki. Their 3rd year with Okumura and others.. seems promising."

When someone get infected, no need to worry for pandemic since the virus can't be transmissed from human to human. There's no clear proof at that time to conclude that human to human transmission is possible."
