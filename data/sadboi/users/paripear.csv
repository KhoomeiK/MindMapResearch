depression,f7w47xu,t1_f7w3lwl,1574029724.0,I’m so sorry about your grandpa. My family is barely holding together all because of my grandma. When she dies I don’t know if I’ll even keep in much contact with my family either. I’m also very thankful for her...and I’ll always stay close to her. Sometimes I think about having kids in the future and how great It will be being able to create my own little family too.. but at this point I don’t think that’s ever going to happen
depression,f7vxyap,t3_dxp0co,1574028049.0,"I’m 18, and I’m far away from home. Right before I was leaving to college my grandma got very sick and she was in rehabilitations for her hip because she fell and broke it, but the nurses were abusing her and overdosing her on meds. I caught the abuse and reported it by calling authorities . I just don’t get how anyone could lay a single finger on my Grandma, she’s just a little old native lady with the biggest heart. She took all of us in when my mom and dad abandoned us. She has sacrificed so much in her life to make others happy. Leaving to college with no choice but to go and start my higher education, my grandma wants me to go but I just want to spend as much as time with her as possible. She’s 82 years old and she’s the closest person to my heart. If she were to pass away I can’t imagine the jagged pain and depression it would cause in my life. I’m already fucking depressed and just being away from home makes it so much harder. I want to see her so bad but my family isn’t coming together for thanksgiving because my aunts are fighting, and she wants me to stay here and stay focused On school. It’s so hard but hearing how proud she is of me makes it worth it. But I just can’t let her know how much I want to die and stop feeling this way. Someone please help"
