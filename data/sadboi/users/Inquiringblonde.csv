FigureSkating,fbbs8lv,t3_ecf0yl,1576706975.0,"it's fascinating to see that when you go back in time, jumps were huuge, and the air position so loose. Can anyone explain that? It seems a lot more difficult, both physically in terms of the height and distance, and technically. Nowadays jumps seem smaller, but faster and with a tighter air position.

Does anyone know when and why the change happened? When I look at skaters from the 90s, I see the huge jumps and loose positions, as well. I understand you can't do quads with the old style, but it seems that triples were easily done. Was it just too volatile? Did they fall more often?"

So think ""up"" and try to really focus all of your energy at once, to get it more dynamic. Everything should be done together and with more power, but also smoothly. Try to get a deeper knee bend, and try to keep your free leg in place after you lift it slightly during takeoff. Additionally, your arms need to do a slight upwards motion in addition to leftwards.
