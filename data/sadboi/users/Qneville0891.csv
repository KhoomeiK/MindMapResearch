batteries,foul0hv,t3_g9lqii,1588085986.0,"In addition to other things mentioned, probably not a good idea to use them in flashlights you only use for emergencies.  NiMh will eventually self discharge after a while and may not be fully charged if your power goes out.  Most major brand alkalines now have a ten year shelf life.  This is a much better option for something that gets used very infrequently."

Hopefully your girlfriend will be pleased that you made the effort and you'll disappear before you get too uncomfortable.  You should be applauded for being sober for whatever reason you have.

Pets,f7t0p3b,t3_dxg9hr,1573999910.0,"I have a three year old pig named Hamilton that lives in our house.  I might be able to provide some insight.  As far as food goes, we feed our guy Mazuri pig pellets along with a variety of other fruits and veggies.  We give him grapes, small tomatoes, and carrots as treats.  Pigs are very smart, ours sits on command.  They are nesting animals, so we give him plenty of old blankets and sheets and he moves them around to create his bed as he pleases.  

Sometimes he can be a little aggressive with our dog when there is food around.   Our dog is very submissive, so it has not been an issue so far, but I would highly recommend not leaving your dog and pig alone together unsupervised. 

Bath time can be tricky.  If its warm enough, we bathe him outside, but otherwise the bathtub is fine.  If you are on Instagram, I would highly recommend following ""Living With Pickles"" for a lot of good advice on pigs.  

And just remember, there is actually no such thing as mini or teacup pigs.  The real tiny pigs you see are usually starved to keep them small which can result in a variety of physical defects."
