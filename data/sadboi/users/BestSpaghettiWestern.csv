She has a very one-sided relationship with her viewers wherein she decides how much info she gives but answers to nothing that follows up from it. It’s her way of virtue signaling, as we’ve seen her doing over the years. All that preach but very little practice.

There was a high likelihood of this happening. All the reliance on good vibes and prayer will not change the fact that when you’re in a lifelong relationship starting at a very young age, chances are you will be missing out in key areas of personal growth and development. This relationship with Tim set the standard and is the only standard she’s known.

Speaking of which - Tim is a cesspool of waste. He’s thrived on Lindy’s YT success back in the day. He is an absent partner and father. He is a cheater. He also possesses very lazy, entitled characteristics that outsiders can see from a mile away. And the worst part about it is that Lindy settled for him. Hard."

By then, I knew what sorts of material I felt good in, what cuts looked good on me, everything. I also had another appointment at a fourth place that I still opted for in case. But it only solidified my choice from the previous shop.

Good luck!

It was scary because we went into the store on a whim and got into making the suits to measure before returning home and seeing some questionable reviews.

Ultimately, make sure the person taking the measurements are communicating to your man what the intended outcome will be so the final product isn’t too far off base.

Eventually we understood that the DOC is definitely a catch-all of all those little things no one thinks of and is essentially the main person running the timeline of your day. They’re also the person who herds you and your loved ones to where they’re supposed to be, which is actually a feat if you’ve ever tried to move groups of people who are distracted by conversation.

weddingplanning,fjgt8ah,t3_fde15n,1583335008.0,"I’m not having a wedding party. My fiancé is sort of in the same realm as yours - his opinion is important to me but sometimes it’s more a learning process for him (us, I should say) than it is a decision making process.

We decided not to have a wedding party because we knew we weren’t going to indulge in all the different events (showers, bachelor and bachelorette trips, etc.) since we also live in a different state than where our wedding will be. Please keep in mind, though, that we are having a private courthouse ceremony the day before our reception. (Our ceremony lands on our anniversary date, but it’s on a weekday and we didn’t want to inconvenience friends and family.) Most of our friends are now scattered across the country. My fiancé’s family is from a different cultural background than mine. We figured that considering the circumstances, we’ll save ourselves the headache and plan this wedding on our own.

If you have it in your budget and need a person to support you through the planning, you know, guide you and your FH through it all, I would recommend a planner. Budget is limited for us, so we are hiring a day-of coordinator at the very least who will slowly take over vendor communication, final venue walkthroughs, decor, timeline, the works. That’s your key person. Take the time to read the reviews and ask as many questions on what they do or don’t do. Research what a coordinator (or planner) is typically responsible for and make sure your person also does the same.

The few things I’ve noticed about planning certain things on our own: (1) you work with less opinions and more of what you want, and (2) it becomes a learning process for you to figure out how much things typically cost and what is fair and workable for your budget - which can also be mediated by a planner if you choose to get one. We have very close friends but they don’t make up the typical bride w/ female friends and groom w/ male friends template. I have male friends and female friends, he has mainly male friends, and all our friends are so unique that to me, it would be a disappointment to dress them all up the same. We’re doing photos before cocktail hour where we have them come by as we’re both getting ready to hang out.

You can do whatever you want! I just worked a plan that suited what I felt comfortable with. Most of wedding planning is figuring out what everyone’s doing, how it “should” be done, then to consider whether that works for you and how to change things up if it doesn’t work for you. It’s 2020 and couples are breaking from tradition and becoming more creative. As a guest, I find special touches about the couple way more meaningful and will remember it more than I would a typical wedding that follows all the “rules”."

I would say yes, I am hoping to figure everything out this weekend. Worst case, if #2 is lagging and takes longer to get back to me, at this point I’ll cut my losses and go for venue #1. Depending on the outcome with the second place, I’ll either inform venue #1 ASAP that there might be a couple days before I send in my deposit or I will just stick with them (the first place) altogether.

Reasons why I am contemplating this last minute change is because of this period between signing and submitting the deposit.

I’ve signed three forms. One is more of a confirmation of our event space and time of use, but there are several numbered items that detail things we will agree to upon using it. Things like when we are expected to pay the remaining amount, informing the location of final guest count, understanding that deposits are non-refundable or non-transferable. Itemizations of things we’re liable for, etc. No where does it say that this agreement will bind us to the venue. It seems like the venue will reserve our date upon receiving our deposit, not upon signing these agreements. Remaining two forms are just confirmation of our event cost breakdown and meal package.

Then the venue let me know what their starting fees are. I told them it was out of my budget and thanked them. Rather than trusting me on this, they ask what that budget is and say they’re willing to work with me on it.

No they’re not. Lol. I emailed back to tell them my ALL-IN budget was about the price of their starting site rental. They sheepishly emailed back saying they thanked me for my honesty and said they hope I can consider them for future events.

We are 7 months out without a venue. It doesn’t seem like we run the risk of losing options in our area as they book up because we’re a Friday wedding. But it’s hard to plan without a venue. We have everything prepped but we can’t execute it workout a flipping venue.
