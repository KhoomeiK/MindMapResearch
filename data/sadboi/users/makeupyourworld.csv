tonightsdinner,fr1ltep,t1_fr1kwmw,1589821959.0,"Yes. I watched a chef on chef‚Äôs table raise it much more humanely. Look for not raised in a cage. Also look at the color and look for it to be a rose-pink, NOT white. A whitish/grey color is indicative of abuse - as in order to attain that pale color the veal are malnourished and anemic. Veal that can not graze and are not eating any milk or grass and getting a generic feed become anemic snd develop infections, than they are given antibiotics. All of this makes the color of the meat lighter. A rose pink veal means it was properly fed and raised outdoors where they belong, instead of indoor cage operations"
tonightsdinner,fr1erv0,t1_fr1eh3s,1589818452.0,"Veal is often improperly cooked or not tenderized well. My mom taught me that to prepare veal it must be either sliced very thin, or pounded with a meat tenderizer to help it not seize and be very soft. And it cooks very quickly, so the cutlets are in oil for just a few minutes! This leaves you with a very crispy exterior and very soft, almost buttery interior. Occasionally we splurge on veal chops which are cooked to more of a medium/medium rare and they‚Äôre like buttery ribeyes with a delicate flavor. I love them with prosciutto, provolone, sage, and balsamic vinegar! Definitely a treat food. Veal is crazy priced by me!!"

For nuggets I use [this](https://www.laurainthekitchen.com/recipes/popcorn-shrimp/) recipe but on bite sized pieces of chicken breast and do this to the T! I also have found that chilling the breaded chicken for about 20 minutes helps the coating stay on A LOT!! For chicken tenders I use [this](https://www.laurainthekitchen.com/recipes/chicken-fingers/) method instead and also get AWESOME results!

Per rack of ribs - 2 Tablespoons Light Brown Sugar, 1 Tablespoon Garlic Powder, 1 Tablespoon Onion Powder, 1 and 1/2 Tablespoons Smoked Paprika (or Reg. if you don‚Äôt have), 1 Tablespoon Chili Powder, 1 teaspoon Dry Mustard, Salt and a lot of Ground Black Pepper to taste. 

To cook I rub this all over, tightly wrap in foil and bake T 300 degrees for about 2 hours. This produces a rib that is very tender but not completely falling apart (which is hard to work with on the grill!) For a larger rack it may take up to 3 hours, just poke between the bones with a skewer and if it goes through easily you‚Äôre good. Next I go out to the grill and grill the ribs, basting with homemade Barbecue sauce for just a few minutes, like 2 or 3 bastings. If you do not have a grill you can do a similar process in the broiler. Here is the easy barbecue sauce recipe. 


https://www.laurainthekitchen.com/recipes/barbecue-sauce/ - I use olive oil instead of veg that‚Äôs the only change. It‚Äôs the only barbecue sauce we really love nowadays, my family gets happy when I have the time to make it!! :) - If you are a grill master you can do all this on the grill but it is hard for me to get out there for the whole day to watch them due to other stuff. If you can keep your temp perfect then go for it! The charred pieces of ribs are my favorite lol.

‚Äî I recommend just watching it. Some racks are smaller than others. St. Louis are bigger and sometimes take a bit longer, but no matter what they will be perfect. :)"
