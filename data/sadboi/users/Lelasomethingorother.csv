selfimprovement,eu226zq,t3_ce89q3,1563380692.0,"I kept hearing about tony robbins so I watched the documentary about him on Netflix, part of me really liked the idea but afterwards I sat back and thought about it.. 
He tends to use what I would call an abusive tactic in which he makes you get deep and personal and take action, even forcing people to do things they might not want to do with the pressure of him and a huge crowd urging them to do so.. he also has been known to trigger people as he is very vulgar and aggressive at times which is the part I find abusive.. he uses terms like “bitch” and claims it’s to get your attention but in reality you shouldn’t be getting put down like that in order to hear someone. 
I think it’s quite ridiculous that they make the crowd dance and “get excited” before tony arrives... why? And yes I believe many people go because they are mentally unstable, because they are struggling and everyone is different.. everyone has different history and experience and vulnerabilities and the way he expects everyone to have endless energy like you mention having a sixteen hour day is not fair or realistic. I know for me one of my biggest issues is managing my energy levels as I struggle with depression and bipolar as well.. and some days doing nothing is exhausting for my body.. forcing me into a state of that kind would not in any way benefit me as it would cause extreme exhaustion and make me feel mentally drained. 
I also do think he definitely uses this to his advantage of selling things. Why the fuck is it so expensive to listen to some guy talk? It’s insane! But he does get people in a sort of trance and they feel good in the moment so they believe it will help them and again like you said even the mantras he used it’s almost brainwashing.. he keeps telling you to take action and stay pumped and of course your going to buy another seminar.. I don’t agree with what he does at all. 
And no I don’t think your stupid or judge you at all for any of this! It’s intended to do exactly what it did to you. And many others have fallen for t, to be honest I would have too if I hadn’t watched the documentary and even after watching I wanted to go see him speak but I didint have money so I couldn’t which gave me time to think about it all and come to a different conclusion on him."

AskLGBT,eu1o4qh,t3_ce8m9q,1563371350.0,"My brother is transitioning (we’re in Canada) and he’s very lucky to have it covered! It costs thousands and thousands of dollars. I’ve seen him psychologically distressed by body image and how much it impacted him. He was constantly embarrassed-and didn’t feel his true gender prior to top surgery. Every time he looked in the mirror he beat himself up over it.. I always tried to help him find clothes to help “hide” his top but there’s only so much you can do..  this created so much anxiety and frustration as well as fed into his depression as people would mis gender him often. 
He now has had top surgery and he is way more confident and smiles much more. His mental state is in such a better place. 
To me people have insecurities of not liking there nose or wanting a boob job which I know is difficult to live with, and at the same time we all have things we don’t like about our body.. but gender issues is much more psychological. And yes many people who are transgender also have to live in fear during transition if they haven’t had surgeries and it is noticeable they are transgender there life is in danger.. that’s cruel and unfair. 
It’s much more then making someone comfortable. It’s safety, it’s reduction of suicide it’s acceptance and equality and keeping humans safe for being who they are."

Anxiety,etz3hco,t1_etyv6ud,1563326421.0,"They are similar. Psychotherapy is more based just on talking where as CBT is a lot of using diagrams it’s commonly known as a “homework therapy” the sheets help you notice thought patterns/ reactions etc. 

I’m not 100% sure though!"
depression,etz3awt,t1_etyxyy1,1563326347.0,"Basically they read through a list of things so they should mention that if you state you plan to harm yourself or someone else they have a duty to report it.. 
that being said therapists will talk to you about it and see where you are at.. if it is ideation they can help you with coping etc.. if you state that “I am going to kill myself” or that you have a set plan to do so is when they have a duty to report. 
I was terrified to talk to my therapists about this in the past but I now know that they won’t automatically report it. They  can’t let you leave if they feel or know that you will act on it. As they have a duty to keep you safe. 

A HELPFUL SIDE NOTE: you can talk to them in hypotheticals as for example 
“Hypothetically if someone were to mention they feel suicidal what would happen?” 
Or 
“I have a friend who is worried about mentioning to there therapist they are suicidal, what would happen in that situation” 
This way they can answer and if you don’t feel comfortable continuing the conversation about yourself you don’t have too. A lot of people will do this. They can’t report it in this case because you haven’t said it’s about you."

Also mindfulness takes practice!

Are you able to look for a new therapist ? And ask about getting your meds changed! Meds take a lot of trial and error as well as balancing if there not working talk to your doctor (or whoever prescribed them!) as for therapists I’m a strong believer that you have to find the right therapist and type of therapy.. if it’s not working then find someone else! I think a lot of us feel like we have to stick with the first person we find.. but think of it as your hiring for a job.. you can hire someone of your choice. If they aren’t suited for the job then keep searching! 

Also it’s important to know different types of therapy.. there’s talk therapy, psychotherapy, DBT, CBT the list goes on and I know it can be intimidating! If you have an anxiety disorder search what therapy is most useful for your diagnosis! And then try to find someone with focus in anxiety!

As for the staring.. I have three brothers with ASD and my on bro in particular has a difficult time with this.. he will stare, it’s because he’s genuinely intrigued or interested in something/someone.

Anxiety,etojexb,t3_ccp2po,1563029384.0,"I’m not from the uk so I’m not sure exactly how it works.. 
as for when your diagnosed or if your diagnosed, you don’t have to tell people it’s up to you what you want or don’t want to share. You can go to a school counsellor or someone you trust and see if there’s anything they can do to help support you if it is affecting your school work- same for work issues. You can explain with as much or little detail as you feel necessary! 
From the sounds of it you have anxiety (I’m no doctor) but you seem very anxious about this situation and have thought patters that most people with anxiety have.. I would say to speak to your doctor! I don’t think it’s in your head! A lot of people have this fear or feel like they are crazy! It’s a common fear but your not crazy! You feel how you feel! See if your doctor can give you any resources.. you can always ask them “hypothetical if someone were to look into getting diagnosed for anxiety, how would that work?” Or “I have a friend who’s scared about the process of being diagnosed, how does it work?” And see what they say! Hope this helps!

Anxiety,etoitsv,t3_ccpgkr,1563028905.0,"This sounds like could be post traumatic stress disorder! I would speak to your doctor and ask them about seeing a psychiatrist and or therapist/psychologist. They can also help with figuring out some coping skills to reduce nightmares.. 
you can search DBT (dialectical behaviour therapy) for nightmares. I haven’t personally used it but it may help you!"
Dogtraining,etoikhd,t3_ccp4u8,1563028695.0,"We have a rescue as well he’s almost five! He’s well trained and always lets us know but the last two or three months he has been having accidents.. he did have a bladder infection for a while, but we believe it’s to do with his anxiety levels as we are preparing to move and part of the family has moved to the cottage while some of us are still in the house.. he is very attached so that’s the only thing we can think of. Not sure if maybe your dog has anxiety/trauma that could be affecting this?"

mentalhealth,etngl9y,t3_ccjpmh,1562986624.0,"Look into a psychiatrist! For a lot of people the chemicals in the brain might not be properly balanced! Talk to your doctor, psychologist or a psychiatrist and see if they can help! Also you need to know that your using the right form of therapy there’s lots of them out there! Look into it and ask questions! If you have a diagnosis it might give you some direction as to what type of therapy will best support you!"

mentalhealth,etnghj2,t3_ccjuy2,1562986494.0,"I know it’s cliché but we all have a point to being here.. my mom always reminds me that maybe someday I will meet someone who feels the way I currently do and I’ll be able to help them through it. And maybe that’s my purpose is to save someone else. I’m not sure what your plans for the future are (if any because I know it’s tough) but maybe that’s your purpose? I know when being depressed it’s hard to believe in this stuff and it’s easy to say “yea but there’s just no point” I’ve been there. Trust me.. and I don’t know how to help you get to where you find your purpose (I’m sorry I wish I did) but there is a reason your here. 
And I’m happy your here still.. please keep fighting!😞"
mentalhealth,etng8nw,t3_ccjr1a,1562986278.0,Yea it’s so hard for me to cry I get the feeling but something blocks it. I’ve been talking to my therapist to try and figure it out. I can’t even cry alone.. it used to be that I just didnt cry in front of people but now I can’t at all😪
depression,etn4px8,t3_ccd8yi,1562976673.0,"I felt the same way on my twentieth! It sucks ! :/ but I am glad you are still here. My wish for my birthday was to die. But now I’m happy I didint, I hope some day soon you will feel that way too! Don’t beat yourself up with the “shoulds” your allowed to feel depressed!"
MentalHealthSupport,etn4k7u,t1_etm4jbw,1562976546.0,I’m glad you have a plan! Do whatever you feel is best for yourself! Wishing you all the best!

MentalHealthSupport,etn4hir,t3_cchqtp,1562976486.0,I would suggest talking to a professional! Search for someone who has experience in eating disorders! I know it’s scary ! It might help though!  They can help you manage and cope with your family and in daily life! Sending love
depression,etm18bs,t3_ccclmn,1562949837.0,"Yes! I know I am a women but I have noticed this! A lot of quotes or people I follow who make motivational posts are directed to women. It seems that for some reason men are brushed off still in today’s society and there’s still the idea that to be “manly” you shouldn’t feel things with is so unrealistic!  

I really hope the world starts to change there views on this as even with sexual assault men and boys are easily looked passed. 

Andy’s man club is in the UK Andy dealt with mental health and started the group to specifically support and raise awareness about men’s mental health! I hope more people follow in his footsteps!"
depression,etm0vi0,t3_cca0y3,1562949618.0,This is such a risky thing with these types of forums. As they are great for support but I have experienced this before as well and it makes your struggles even harder.
