socialskills,fmnmm12,t3_fvyd5x,1586229641.0,"I think sometimes it helps to just ask her why she always talks to you and listen to her answer. Then rephrase it, “oh, so your family is really talkative?” Absolutely no judging her. If she starts getting defensive try a compliment too, “I think I understand, I guess some people are pretty talkative. It’s cool you always have so much to say.” Be authentic with any compliments and really see the value in her talkativeness. Once you feel like you’ve shown her you understand and are not being judgey about it, talk to her about your side. be like, “I’m not used to talking a lot. Sometimes it’s kind of hard for me to do it. I hope you don’t think that means I’m annoyed with you or trying to be cold. I’ve really been struggling with how I can talk to you about this without coming off like I’m being rude or dismissive. Is there any way I can let you know when I’m not able to to talk sometimes so I don’t accidentally offend you? I hate feeling like I’m not giving you my best self.” 
By the way, I think it’s ok to write some or all of it down later if it’s hard to get everything in the conversation at once. It can take a couple conversations if it needs to."

I don’t think the official tribal membership is something she ever considered as part of the equation of her racial identity, not that she exactly claims to be native, but I think for her and my mother they were proud to have that piece of heritage, to be related to my great grandma. Warren didn’t tell everyone, she just contributed to a cookbook and no one who hired her at Harvard even knew until later about the school listing her as a minority. She didn’t get her career because she hatched some nefarious plot to pretend she was another race. She just believed her heritage was enough without tribal membership and apologized without making excuses when it became clear she was in the wrong. This whole Native American controversy seems a little overblown and gatekeep-y. Until she was in trouble, I thought the “official” standard was 1/16 of some race and you can list it on paperwork.

AMWFs,fdcvumn,t3_dy44rj,1578285792.0,"Personally, I find it very difficult to introduce men to my parents. Even being with my guy for one year, he’s only met my mother once and I never talk to my family about him. It has nothing to do with race, I’ve treated white guys I’ve dated the same. My first boyfriend threatened to break up with me unless I introduced him to my parents. The morning after he had dinner with us, my mother screamed at me and threatened to send me to a military school. He was an honor roll student from a good family. 

I have a complicated relationship with my parents and a wonderful relationship with my boyfriend. Every time I think about talking to them about him, I think of all the negative and controlling behaviors they might start displaying and avoid it. It’s my way of protecting my relationship, my boyfriend, and myself from them, even though I love them. I don’t know what your boyfriend’s reasons are, but I think people who come from families where they can’t imagine ever hiding anything from their parents can be very judgmental about people who have had to hide key aspects of their life just to live in peace at times. Maybe your boyfriend isn’t serious or maybe his relationship with his parents is more complicated than others realize. You can only ask him and try to understand. I think your friends sound a little nasty to jump right to the conclusion he’s “using” you for sex only. There are better ways to get sex. He invested a lot already. 

If it helps, my bf’s parents loved that I learned a little Chinese. My Chinese is crap, but they were excited I was trying. Most white Americans aren’t Chinese speakers at all so it doesn’t take a lot to stand out. Maybe you can tell your boyfriend that you want to prepare to meet them before next visit and ask him how you can do that. Learn some Chinese phrases such as “nice to meet you” and try working through some Duolingo or watching shows/movies his parents are into. Ask him about their interests and hobbies and see if you can’t find some way to relate to them. If they’re into badminton, go play badminton with your boyfriend and suggest he bring his parents when they’re in town. Something like that. Ask him what kind of clothes they like (for girls) and try to wear something they’ll like. Give him as much control over the situation as possible, let him decide where the introduction will take place and whether he wants you to bring a small present. Show him you’re excited about his ma and ba and willing to reassure them that he’s dating someone who values him and his roots. It doesn’t have to be complicated, but, for example, my boyfriend has very religious parents so we decided it would be best to meet them at a church service and I didn’t mention that I’m not particularly religious. I didn’t lie to them and pretend I’m a saint, but I was willing to do what I could to create a good impression. We all went out to a Chinese restaurant he knew they would like after and I spoke fondly about my favorite dishes and heaped praise on their son, telling them how humble and hard working he is (all true).  There’s no controlling everything, but hopefully you two can do your best to show them that you truly respect him and hold similar values to the ones their family holds. At the end of the day, it’s not your fault or his if his parents won’t accept their adult son’s dating choices. So, don’t beat yourself (or him) up if they don’t take it well. Good luck!"

Culturally, it’s common where I’m from, but I would NEVER ask that of a partner and I wouldn’t have it done to a son. Just my opinion. I had a male friend whose father converted to a religion and determined they would get circumcised. Well, my friend said it was very painful and he may have lost some feeling in his penis. There are risks and he never got over someone doing that to him. Don’t get it done for someone else. Only do it for yourself and know the risks. Your alternative is just tell her it’s more to love!"

So, your best shot will be to focus on doing positive things in your life and backing off a bit. Rejection can really sting, but this case sounds like it’s nothing personal. So, be proud that you took the shot! It takes courage! Try to follow her lead and understand her more.

Then he was developing a relationship with the kid over the game and using his relationship with the child as an excuse to pop up. Obviously Dion won’t get that’s weird, but it’s weird. Worse, Pat was getting away with it because Nicky was vulnerable: grieving and out of work. How many grown men are spending hours on hours playing games with a little kid like that? Don’t get me wrong, some guys are good w/ kids and totally cool, but they usually bond like that w/ the parents around and let the kid play games with players his own age most of the time. Every time someone said it was weird he’d turn it around on them like he was just trying to help and just such a good guy. Really manipulative and evasive.

TrollXChromosomes,f3w7l5u,t1_f3twmxb,1571193963.0,I once heard a guy making fun of another guy for getting a “fancy” $50 haircut. The last time I got a haircut under 50 bucks I ended up looking veeeeery rough. AOC is a professional politician. No shit she pays $300.

socialskills,f3w6dgc,t1_f3t114i,1571193110.0,"Yeah, he should really know better. Even granting him some cluelessness, he’s taken it too far. I just wanted to share it in case maybe you felt like it could be a case where he’s just oblivious or even thinks you’re enjoying his texts. I don’t want to assume he’s just taking advantage of his position, but I wouldn’t give him too many excuses. His behavior is unprofessional no matter the intent."
socialskills,f3szgs8,t1_f3sytg8,1571113347.0,"Good for you! I hope he chills out. I read that oftentimes people who do this stuff overestimate how comfortable their target feels rejecting them and underestimate the target’s discomfort level. <https://hbr.org/2018/04/to-reduce-sexual-misconduct-help-people-understand-how-their-advances-might-be-received> maybe just saying something like “I’m sure you mean well, but these texts make me feel uncomfortable.” Would tip him off that this isn’t the cute mutually-enjoyable situation he’d like to believe it is."
socialskills,f3syjyn,t1_f3lzr69,1571112565.0,"Ps. I just remembered a hug-blocking move I developed because of exactly this type of professional problem! I You can step back and put your hand up between his body and yours (stop or wait sign) and go, “Sorry! I’m not much of a hugger!” If he’s already closed in you can still go, “K, but no more hugs! I’m not big on hugging!” Make it clear you’re not into the hug by shaking your head and using body language. You can do it with all your coworkers if you want. He may try repeatedly. Keep at it. “No thanks! I’m not big on hugs! We can shake hands/fist bump/high five if you want!” You might feel weird at first, but it’s worth it. 

I remember a guy once forced the hug anyway going, “you know you like it! C’mon!” I just said, “actually, I really don’t.” Very awkwardly as he held me in an unreciprocated side hug. Not ideal, but it feels better than pretending to enjoy an unwanted hug . See also: Jerry Seinfeld reacting to Kesha trying to hug him. “No thanks!” “Please!” *steps away* “No thank you!” 

Same for pokes and pushes. Don’t giggle or try to be “nice” about it. Just give him a look of confusion and step away or if he’s got you trapped sitting, go “I don’t want to be poked. Can you sit over there?” Try to create space between your bodies if possible and say clearly that you don’t like it. Best case, he’s just socially awkward and his crush will pass. He might try to guilt trip you at first because you’re cutting him off from all these fun, flirty interactions he looks forward to, but over time, he’ll learn. Best of all, there’s no confusion over whether or not you like it. If he thinks it’s a game and tries to chase you when you say no or move away, put your hand in the stop sign, “Stop! What are you doing?” “Just messing with you!” “Why are you pushing me?” “What? You don’t *like* it when I *push* you?” “No, I’m not touchy-feely.” “Oh c’mon! I was just kidding!” “I just don’t like it. Sorry.” —*shrug and Change the topic to something work related*— He might pout, but this is a bandaid that’s got to be ripped off. 

If he starts with unsolicited “gifts” you can similarly reject those. “Oh? What’s this?” “I brought you a cupcake!” “How sweet, but no thanks! I’m not interested!” “Well, it’s yours!” “I’m just not interested in having a cupcake. Thanks for thinking of me!” Then return to tasks."
socialskills,f3ssutm,t1_f3lzr69,1571108595.0,"Ew. I’m so sorry you have to deal with that. As a woman who tends to look younger than I am and someone who doesn’t have a particularly intimidating presence, I’ve been subjected to similarly juvenile flirting and it always feels patronizing. It evokes a similar feeling to slime. It’s easy for me to tell you what you should do over the internet, but in your shoes, I know I’d really struggle to respond firmly and assertively. I just hope you don’t feel bad if you do. Wish you all the best. Hope it doesn’t get any more out of hand. For what it’s worth, you are not crazy or overreacting. That is gross behavior and if your boss had a dude do it to him, he’d certainly lose it."
atheism,f3jwzcz,t1_f3jmdq1,1570959359.0,"I like the idea of finding a secular way to participate! I don’t believe in supernatural stuff, but I like to give thanks before a meal. I don’t pray to anything or anyone, I just close my eyes and give thanks for the meal, the labor that went into cultivating it,  the people who prepared it, and anyone sharing it with me because gratitude demonstrably improves life satisfaction, because it’s a personal ritual, and because I enjoy a moment of reflection and gratitude before I eat. No god, but it’s an arguably “spiritual” ritual. If I had to read a “spiritual” book, I might go with The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius because it can be read in an afternoon, but give you something to think about the rest of your life."
atheism,f3jry8k,t1_f3hfjue,1570957443.0,I worked with a program for mums in recovery. Government funded. The AA and the therapists would push religion sooo hard. I’m ok with it if the client is looking for that and feels more supported by having their faith integrated in their recovery program. Churches can be great for helping people form healthier support networks and strengthening community bonds. I don’t see why a therapist has to come in and say “it can only be a God thing” when a group of clients are learning to be better mums or why clients should be made to attend an LDS caroling service as part of the program.
TrueOffMyChest,f3jobzx,t3_dgz30l,1570955835.0,"Aww. That is awful! I love kids too! I’ve worked in education and I’ve seen some really great male educators. I remember a school telling my best friend he couldn’t tell parents he was gay or be seen near the school with his boyfriend. He lived by the school too. It was so sad and he eventually left education for HR. Yes, there are predators in the world, but being male isn’t reason enough to be fired or accused. :( I always try to have other staff present if I’m with a student. (I work in tech now, but I still teach on weekends for girls interested in tech). Maybe you can tell her if you always have assistants or others nearby? Or even if there’s video monitoring? I don’t really know how much privacy you have with the kids, but I really prefer to have things very open so parents never have to even worry about inappropriate behavior. I’m not sure what else can really be done.

Edit: just read there are cameras and parents can watch. This mom is just bonkers. Nvm"

socialskills,f3jkrnl,t1_f3in0qs,1570954260.0,"You’re minimizing. This superior’s behavior is unprofessional and disruptive to your work. That’s the point and he can certainly change this behavior, but obviously you fear retaliation. That’s what HR is for. Not only that, he’s brought other coworkers into it. Go to HR and hopefully they’ll nip this in the bud and you’ll never have to deal with it again. If you wait too long it gets turned into a “why didn’t she say something earlier” thing and you don’t know how burned and embarrassed he may get. If you don’t say anything, he owns the narrative and he really could retaliate. Also... poking? Ew. No man who respects me professionally pokes me. This isn’t about hurting him or making a character judgement, this is about being able to *work* at work and be treated like the professional you are— not a little girl."

TrueOffMyChest,f2sejtp,t3_de5mt0,1570382009.0,"I think it’s totally fine to walk out of any movie including if you’re not ok with the topics. I don’t think people have to endure something that’s not for them even if they thought it might be at first. Asking theaters to ban it, though? That’s annoying. Write a negative review, tell your friends to boycott, but don’t force it out of the theaters just to censor it. Maybe some people are getting something out of it without being pathological, evil, or whatever. We do have a shooting problem, though. I understand the fear. :("
