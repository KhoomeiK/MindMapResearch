relationship_advice,fq9wxd6,t1_fq9uv5f,1589208653.0,"Personally, I think trying to put words to the situation is a very common reaction, but “growing apart” or “out growing” the other person is natural. There are the rare occasions that people will meet in their youth and stay together until death, but most of the time those people tend to evolve at the same rate, usually very slowly. When you’re in a relationship, and have been for sometime but are starting to feel unfulfilled, that may be an indication you’re growing at a more rapid rate than your partner. Not to say the relationship won’t continue to work, however it won’t be the same relationship. 

If you’re making changes to improve your life, and your partner isn’t choosing to do the same, then in all likelihood at one point down the road the paths will diverge. Being the age you are a lot of growth may occur, if one should choose. If you’re career oriented and want to move to the city, but your bf wants to stay close to home and start a family, then “growing apart” is essentially how that situation would be described."
relationship_advice,fq9t9ag,t3_ghnyhp,1589206583.0,"Speaking from an “older” perspective, and the other side, you cannot force feelings that you’re unsure of or may not have at all. Had I been 24, 48, or 72 and my partner at the time all of a sudden decided to “check out” like they did, how I immediately reacted would have stayed the same. In fact, once before five years prior my LDR partner at the time abruptly decided they no longer wanted to be in a relationship, but in a much more dramatic and careless fashion. Even then my reaction was the same: “You have to do what’s best for you.”

Considering that you and your bf have been together a while, and you’re being honest with your feelings, the best decision for the both of you is that he give you some space. Although from what you wrote this is something that you have been feeling for a while, the best thing he can do for the both of you is respect your wishes, whether there is a chance of returning to the relationship or not. I’m not sure where you’re located, but one thing I’ve noticed across the globe is that the true end of relationships are over dramatized, and people are made to feel unnecessarily guilty for their feelings (or lack there of). Industries are built on heartbreak, betrayal, and also “the clean-up”; deceiving us into thinking that there must be something wrong with us—something we need to fix—if we fall out of love, or are “not loved” by  the other.

The truth is that love never dies, though it might evolve and change. What is worse, leaving a relationship that you’re no longer clear about to spare the other persons feelings, or denying your own and impeding true happiness? 

Whatever decision you make, or space you decided to take, do it with a clear conscious, knowing you’re intent is what’s best for both of you. Encourage your bf to do the same. If he truly loves you he will give you the time and space you need, even if you do decide to return and marry him. As long as both he, and yourself, loves each other unconditionally you both will be led to make the right decisions for you.

Later on I heard another woman describing a similar feeling to a friend, and she said it felt like a belt tightening around her chest. Not to give you more anxiety, but I would recommend taking the test to see if you have Coronavirus. If you don’t have it then at least you could eliminate that cause for concern. If you do, then you’d know how to address it properly. Not sure where you live, but a clinic or testing sight is bound to be near you, and will likely give you peace of mind.

I’ve learned, especially if you’re a woman, that some doctors hear symptoms and they go straight to anxiety or “muscle strain”. Once I was told I had a pulled muscle, and went another year+ before getting a second opinion, although I knew it was something else. When I did finally get a doctor to listen I needed to have a mass removed that had grown to the size of a goose egg (doctor’s words).
