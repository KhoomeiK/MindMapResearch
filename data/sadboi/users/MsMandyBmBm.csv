As for the “running joke” about demons following. That can happen. Demons aren’t always attached to a place but can also attach themselves to people. 

I once had an experience when I was 10.  I lived in a very old farmhouse (one of three places we lived that year). It was very late, probably between 2-4 am. 

I heard my father calling to me by name. It was odd because if he wanted me to wake up he’d come to my room and gently wake me up as he always did, but it was my dad and he has a distinctive deep voice so I went.

Long story short, my “dad” was not calling from the hall, the bottom of the stairs or from the pitch black of the rest of the house. I got to his room where the door was actually closed (weird for my parents, they never shut the door) and when I opened it the tv was on full static and my parents were sleeping on their backs like sardines in a can. This is also odd as both my parents are side sleepers. (NOTE: my parents room was on the first floor off the living room. My sister and I were on the second floor towards the back of the house).

My family brushed this off. Said I was having a sleep walk dream and no big deal. More things happened to me in that house and in that town. We didn’t live there for no more than 5 months when we left. 

As an adult I looked into this. Asked around and a demon having your name is not good. I asked once what would happen if I’d answered the entity when it beckoned me, and I was given an overwhelming response from several people that they hoped I hadn’t. Responding to a demon calling your name or giving a demon your name allows for the demon to attach to you.

If this really is a true story, be careful. Not sure about what it was that was calling me when I was 10 but I remember the cold and uneasy feeling of pure dread that was running through me as I was trying to find my “dad”. I love my dad and call him for everything. I would never fear him as if he wanted to hurt me, and I felt that that night when I went to the voice."

creepyencounters,fi2ji7w,t3_f5wkzs,1582081219.0,"My exes mom was an avid on again off again meth addict. When she’d start using again we’d often just ignore her. Note: when she was using she’d blow up our phones with weird messages and after not answering for the 10 billionth time, the messages would be extremely angry, followed by hatefulness.

She’d been clean for a few months, but one night she started down her usual path of phone calls and texts. She also had a lot of health problems. During this clean spell she’d had a health scare the resulted in a weeks long hospital stay (she’d almost died on her porch).

My ex and his sister refused to answer as they were convinced she started using again. Now we were in a new town where, I figured, she didn’t have those type of “connections” so I was legitimately concerned she was having health issues. Thus, I answered her call.

Now, when she was high (she’s also a severe alcoholic) and drunk her rants were rarely creepy. She usually just talked about her troubled past and what not, but this time it was one of the most chilling talks I’ve ever had with her.

When I answered she immediately said “oh thank god Mandy! I need you to come save me right now” I regretted answering, as I knew her high voice. As my ex and his sister mouthed to me “I told you” I proceeded to ask what was wrong.

Long story short, she’d said there was a clown in their drive way with a shotgun. He had a large white dog and there were “others” in the bushes and out back of the house. She said they’d just murdered someone in the street (they lived in a very well populated neighborhood, houses within feet of each other). Said there was blood everywhere. That the white dog was soaking in it. 

I told her if that were the case that she should call police, but that it probably wasn’t real. She cried and yelled at me and continued down the path of her meth rant ways. She kept me on the line for over 30 minutes.

Her story was so chilling that it legitimately scared me and I wouldn’t shut up about it until we checked on her the next day. Of course it was all a lie. Still spooked me.

Sounds like you had someone who was totally on drugs in your story. Even then those guys, though high, can be so scary and dangerous as they can not decipher reality from dis allusion."

bipolar,fgqx7b8,t1_fgqw4zm,1581033384.0,"My first black kitty was named Mille. My dad came home one night from work and took my sister and I to a coworkers house who’s cat just had kittens. My sisters was a short haired cat named gus, and I got his black long haired sister who I named Millie.

Backstory: I came from a home of mental/physical abuse. And I watched my parents abuse each other (my mother is bipolar schizophrenic and my dad, well he’s very controlling)

Millie was my getaway. She and I had one hell of a bond. When I’d be hurt/crying from whatever happened that day she’d lay on my chest and purr consistently until I fell asleep, and when I woke she was still there.

My mom suffered an episode and gave her away while I was at school. I  came home to find my friend was gone. My sister revealed later that Millie was killed shortly after by a coyote (my mom had her declawed and then gave her to a farm as a barn cat).

The one behind me is named Sid... Sid Vicious. I found him and when I picked him up as a kitten he IMMEDIATELY started purring. No shit IMMEDIATELY, and gave me face boops. He also looks IDENTICAL to Millie. He sleeps on my chest and purrs, and when I’m hurt the most he knows exactly what to do.

The one that lays to the right is named Piper. Piper is my boyfriends cat that reminded me of Millie and was the reason I found Sid.

When I’m hurt, or sad they protectively lay around me purring (like in the picture). I like to think it’s Millie still protecting me."

Ghoststories,fgqloev,t1_fgqhbj8,1581026580.0,"I’m so sorry you’re going through it now as an adult. It’s very scary for a child but for an adult, when you’re “comprehensive” of “reality”... you have a very hard time making sense of it, usually writing it off. And even when you do believe you think you got some mental problem. Or at least that’s how others make you feel.

I’ve always thought I was like a “portal” or “hot spot” for ghosts/paranormal/demons. I’ve only had 5 boyfriends but I’ve told each one, I’ve told my parents, my sister, my brother, friends, etc. I just want someone to believe me. But they all laugh it off.

I can predict things and sense things which freaks them all out, but they always think I had some I knowledge prior. Even if it is impossible for me to. 

The instance I spoke of is only one occurance ive had, but I’ve had many many more. This one was just the scariest. I’ve had a couple others that rival it though.

The most recent (I’m 31 years old) was about a month ago. I was sleeping next to my fella and he started growling. Now he snores so I do what I normally do and I nudged him to roll over.  But the growling got worse and he lifted himself in an ungodly motion. I’m not kidding his head was tilted all the way back and his neck craned where he was biting at me and twitching while semi-levitated. 

I immediately started screaming and slapping his arm begging him to wake up. When he came to I was screaming and crying, terrified. I could feel whatever it was too. It was all around me.

He said it was like he knew it was happening but he wasn’t in his body. Like he could see it but it wasn’t him. He waived it off as some half in between dream. Where you’re halfway between awake and sleep.

I wouldn’t allow myself to sleep, like I said I could feel whatever it was. Shadows moved and I was aware of everything around me. 

Later that night it happened one last time. His hand started to raise, and he was dead asleep. It raised pointed at me. I keep thinking if I should’ve let it happen just a little further to see what would’ve happened. However I was a coward and freaked and nudged him saying “it’s happening again” as soon as I did his arm dropped hard.

Edit: I forgot to mention the most important part. My boyfriend and I sleep with a heater at the bottom of his bed. We live in a state that’s winter 9 mo outta the year and it gets pretty chilly.

The night this specific instance occurred he kept pulling hard on the blankets complaining he was extremely cold. 

Now he is my personal heater himself because he his abnormally warm when we sleep. He sweats constantly to the point that I wash his sheets about once every 2-3 days due to the sweat smell.

That night he woke up gasping two times prior to the incident. And he pulled almost all of the covers shivering non stop and wrapping himself in them. All this with the heater on full blast at the base of the bed.

Right before the incident occurred I felt the chill as well. I even woke him and said that it was weird because it felt like it was coming from above our heads, but that was absolutely impossible as his bed board sits up against a solid wall."

The last memory I have of that type of instance I had ran out of the house with my emergency cell phone wailing. Normally I’d go shut the door without question and continue making a snack, but the last one.... Well I can’t say I recall exactly what happened, but what I do remember is that I sat at the edge of my driveway for over an hour trying to get a hold of my parents crying uncontrollably.

When I was about 9 or 10 my family moved into a very old farm house in a very small town. This town is extremely creepy. We drove home one night and there was a woman with wild hair In a nightgown walking down the middle of the road. At the end was a police car. My father pulled over and asked if she was ok and the police told us we saw nothing and to drive on. Just to give an idea.

One night I was sleeping in my room. It was rare my sister and I did not sleep together, not share a room. Usually if I had a room I’d still sneak into her bed. I was very uncomfortable being alone in the dark.

I heard a voice that I believed was my father calling my name. I got up, and was apprehensive. It was so strange he’d call me from the bottom of the stairs in the pitch black.

He kept telling me to come down, he needed to speak to me. I went. When I said I couldn’t find him I just decided to go to his room. The door was closed and when I opened it my father was laying next to my mother perfectly asleep.

I recently found out that I used to scream in my sleep for long periods of time for “no reason”. This newly revealed fact about myself terrified me to my core, and it still messes with my head a little at night. I also suffered severe night terrors when I was a child.

Knowing hurts, and somehow knowing every detail makes it worse. However, in my case, knowing helps me move on. If I know then I see the weakness I don’t want to see again. It helps me in picking my partner for the future. If I see the red flags now, with what’s happened twice before, then I can see how much stronger I am and what I don’t want to see in a partner in the future.


I know it’s really not much, next to nothing to be honest, but I’m sorry for what’s happened. More so because you share a life you both created. It’s hard but you’re already moving. You are just hung up on anger you have with yourself for allowing someone to enter your life who didn’t deserve you.

You shouldn’t be angry for loving someone. You cared, and it’s not on you because they didn’t. You’re already moving on, you just have to let go. Someone much greater is waiting for you. Just hold your head high and expect greatness, as it took a lot of great to do what you’ve already done."
