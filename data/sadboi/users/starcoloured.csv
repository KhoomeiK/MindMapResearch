bipolar,fl7qpjh,t1_fl7offs,1584907348.0,"Thank you! It's St. Petersburg, Russia. The air is always very humid, so fog is common here. Wouldn't call it a dream tho. The city itself is quite nice looking, this area though is full of tall faceless buildings, but there was a part in the view where you could see a forest, now there are even more ugly buildings being built. You can see in the photo one of them completed and I really hate it so much. It always ruins my photos (except this one lol)"
bipolar,fl7dux7,t1_fl7djjm,1584899711.0,It's actually a great idea! I might do something like that. Thank you
bipolar,fl7bwcm,t1_fl7brf4,1584898561.0,It's  just fog

So sometimes all of them get full  and people start putting things on filled up cans. Little gust of wind and all of it flies off. Lots of rubbish lies everywhere like in a dump. Maybe there is a similar issue around that place..."
