BPD,fj5eq2g,t3_fbhubm,1583030895.0,"From what I understand: A lot of us don't have emotional object permanence so if I don't physically see my partner for a few days, I forget there is an emotional connection to that person. It allows me to move on extremely fast from relationships without needing to really process it in the way that non-BPD folks process them. It applies to all relationships. Family, friends, etc. If I don't see them, I forget I cared about them."
BPD,fj5e3q0,t3_fbinu1,1583030478.0,"I felt that way until I met my recent boyfriend who I am moving in with, in 2 days. I am also a lot more satisfied with my hobbies and my career path than I used to be. I feel like our life is finally going to begin. I'm 29."

AskWomen,fijvgj1,t3_f7t9zm,1582465392.0,About two months. I said it first. He said he felt the same way about me. Took a bit longer for him to actually say the words back but we both say it all the time now & we're moving in together soon :)
AskWomen,ffp5np3,t3_eubm91,1580086863.0,"I messed up a friendship a few years ago. I was best friends with someone online. After time away from that person, I realize now that I have mental health conditions that couldn't have allowed me to be the kind of friend that that person needed. I don't have a long enough attention span due to ADD for the long conversations that they wanted to have with me. I also have a very bad memory. I've forgiven myself for it. It's not my fault that I am the way I am. And it's not their fault that they need a different kind of friend that can be more attentive."

BPD,f78ml5t,t1_f78kf6j,1573495400.0,"Yeah, I'm pretty calm. I think I am stunned by all of it. At this point, I just want him to admit to it- so that I can properly process it all and decide if I can trust him again. Until he admits to cheating on me while she was there, I feel like I am at a stuck point. I went through tons of therapy a few years ago and while I was initially fuming about this, I calm down very fast these days. I still love him and don't want to make the situation worse than it already is. He's been fully apologetic and hasn't argued with me about any of it. He just tells me that he's ashamed of it all. (Not ashamed of me, but of his actions with her, etc). I don't think I will forgive him for this. But I would like to move passed it. But I don't think I can until he admits that he cheated while she was there."

I just want him to be honest with me and tell me the truth. If he would admit that things went down while she was there, then I could at least accept that he had been honest with me at some point and try to move forward with the knowledge that he actually did tell me what had happened. I don't think I'll be able to trust him until he admits to everything."
