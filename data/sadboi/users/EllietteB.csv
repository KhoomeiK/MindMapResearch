I feel you. I've been diagnosed with the same mental illnesses. At the moment I'm working from home, but the thought of going back to work scares me so badly. I know I'm going to have to sign off sick once my office reopens. I live in East London, but work in West London. I'm going to have to travel by train. On a normal day I struggle with the trains, because I'm either experiencing really bad claustrophobia or I'm terrified someone will accidentally touch me (I have touch phobia). Now, I'm going to have to add catching covid-19 to the list of things I need to worry about. On top of that, my boss was my father figure and he passed away in March from covid-19. The lockdown has meant that I haven't had to fully experience my grief. Returning to work is going to rip those wounds wide open.

I would advise you to call you doctor and get another sick note and possibly ask to be referred for counselling/an occupational therapist. Don't force yourself to go to work if you know you won't be able to handle it. It'll just make your mental health worse and it won't do anyone any good.

Feel free to message me if your employers try to force you to go back. They might not care, but it's still illegal to discriminate against someone with a disability. Covid-19 or no covid-19, you're still protected by the Equality Act.

I work for a charity in the UK that gives free legal advice to people in need. We cover employment law. If you want, I could pass you our number so you could speak to our employment law adviser before you decide what to do about your work?"
sex,fr1v6r4,t1_fr1ub6d,1589826498.0,"I found out because a friend told me I should get checked. It was actually a guy I was crushing on. I used to complain to him about how bad my period pain was and it was badddd. I would spend nights curled up in bed literally feeling like someone was craving up my organs with a knife. He told me that didn't sound normal, so I finally took the plunge and went to see my doctor.

Are you still having periods? If so, I would recommend going on to contraception. It helps so much with the pain. I've used the mini pill for couple years, which was great. Recently switched to the contraceptive implant that goes in your arm. It's so much better than the pill and you can't even tell it's there unless you physically try to touch it. It lasts for 3 years, so you can essentially just forget about it once it goes in."
sex,fr1th3l,t1_fr1q3dp,1589825667.0,"Unfortunately, the only treatment for endo is pain management. The pain management usually involves pain meds, meds to stop ovulation, and surgery to remove cysts and endo tissue when necessary.

I don't necessarily think you have endo. The pain you're feeling just seems to be the normal pain you get from having cysts. You just need to get the cysts checked, because sometimes the cysts start to rupture or they twist and that also causes pain. 

I found out about the condition of my ovaries when I was 24. I'm now 29. I've been on contraception since I was 24, because I can no longer stand the pain from periods, etc. My doctors said that the only way I can come off the contraception is if I'm ready to have kids or start menopause. The contraception has been quite helpful though, it's actually reduced the size of my cysts and stopped them from getting better."
sex,fr1l6a8,t1_fr1jffz,1589821638.0,"Yes, the physicians all have basic knowledge. They're not necessarily specialists. That's why most of them actually dismiss ovarian pain as normal period pain. I've read comments on a lot of medical forums too and there's a lot of horror stories out there of some women not being diagnosed until they got rushed to the hospital. They kept getting dismissed whenever they tried to get help with the ovarian pain.

Okay, so the ultrasounds are actually to monitor the cysts on your ovaries to see whether they are growing, shrinking or if there are any new ones. Laparoscopy is investigative keyhole surgery. It's the only way to diagnose endo. Endo isn't just cysts. It's ovarian tissue growing outside the ovaries/attaching themselves to other organs. The tissues cause scars on/pain to the organs they attach themselves to. Doctors can't rule out endo unless the laparoscopy is done.

You definitely need to go back to the gynaecologist. Painful sex is one of the things you're supposed to look out for. Please contact your gynaecologist."
sex,fr17lyc,t1_fr158wq,1589814767.0,"Is your doctor a man or a woman?

Not sure what planet they're on, but cysts cause pain. It's a well known fact. Definitely not a good doctor. Hopefully the new doctor is better.

Sadly not all doctors are created equal. When I first when to mine complaining about the pain, she tried to tell me there was nothing wrong. She legit said it was normal for women to experience pain there. My pain was so bad when I was on my period, that I would actually black out for couple minutes during cramps. I pushed her and argued with her until she sent me to a gynecologist.

Is your doctor a normal doctor or a gynecologist? Normal doctors aren't fully trained with problems concerning reproductive organs, so you'll find that they do dismiss your pain. You need a gynecologist. Not sure how your system works, but here you need a referral from the normal doctor to the gynecologist.

You could try doing other things with your guy that isn't PIV? I'm a little concerned that you really could injure yourself if you continue PIV without getting checked. One of my friends had to go A&E recently because her cyst ruptured. She said that pain was some of the worst she's ever experienced and what made it worse is that they made her wait ages to be seen because they couldn't identify where the pain was coming from. Another friend actually had to have surgery to remove some of her cysts because she couldn't handle the pain anymore.

What test did they do for endometriosis? Was it the laparoscopy? Because that's the only way to officially diagnose endo. I haven't had the laparoscopy as yet. My doctors have said that there's no point in having it done because there's no cure for endo. I really do hate how dismissive they are to conditions that affect women's reproductive organs. It's like our pain don't even matter."

sex,fr14lee,t3_glz3td,1589813143.0,"If you're feeling pain despite being naturally lubricated then it's your PCOS that's causing the pain. Painful sex is unfortunately one of the symptoms of ovarian illnesses. 

I'm also speaking from experience. I also have cysts on my ovaries. My doctors think I have PCOS or endometriosis. I only realised something was wrong when I used to experience extreme pain not only while I was on my period, but also during and after masterbation. 

Sex was also very painful for me too when I started. I'm on antidepressants, so that was part of the problem. Another, was that my ex was fond of ""jackhammering"". I noticed that my ovaries or the general area would hurt whenever he was putting too much pressure on my lower body. Thankfully he was patient and understanding and immediately stop.

One way of checking if it's your cysts that are the problem is to use your hand and push down on your ovaries. For me even applying pressure over the skin causes some pain. I've also had a gynecologist do a test that you could also try. He inserted his finger on one hand into me and also pushed down on one of my ovaries with the other hand. There was also pain when he did that.

I would suggest you speak to your doctor and seek advice from a gynecologist. It's better to get advice before you keep trying to get past the pain, because you may end up injuring yourself unintentionally.

Edit: after having a look at a couple of medical articles, it sounds like the cysts are what is causing the pain for you. Please seek help from a gynecologist because you could end up rupturing a problematic cyst."
sex,fr03lyw,t3_glmgt8,1589782735.0,"29F here. Definitely not an expert when it comes to sex, but I am a semi-expert on mental health since I suffer from so many mental illnesses. Like some have said here, your friend is suffering from extreme anxiety and self-hatred related to sex. The evidence is there from what happened during your attempt at a first time. The nausea is a clear sign, anxiety always affects the stomach when it's past moderate level. The hitting himself while being on the verge of tears is his self-hatred getting out of control.

Some people have suggested that he may have gone through something traumatic as a child, I agree. I don't think he reacted that way during the first time attempt because of childhood trauma though. He reached that way because of the trauma caused by his past relationships. For some reason, people never actually recognise that men, like women, can be traumatised from past romantic relationships. Not sure if it's because they think men are too ""strong"" to be affected like that by a woman. What he went through with those previous relationships would have been traumatic for anyone, especially the relationship where the woman withheld sex. I think that would have been the worst one and it may be the source of the extreme self hatred he has. I imagine what happened during and after that relationship, was that he felt that he wasn't ""good enough"" to have sex with since the woman kept withholding sex.

I agree with everyone, please try to rekindle your friendship with him. He didn't stop talking to you because you did anything wrong, he stopped talking to you because he cares a lot about what you think of him. He's too embarrassed and filled with self-hatred. He probably thinks that you hate him and think extremely badly of him because of how the first time attempt went. Shutting people out after a bad social interaction, is quite a common thing that people with anxiety issues do. 

Please, please don't give up on him. Your attempt at a first time with him would have likely become another traumatic experience for him. It's going to be a very very long time before he attempts to have sex again because of it. He will also not attempt to confide in anyone else again, like he did with you, because he'll think he'll end up embarrassing himself again. You are most likely the only person who knows how much he's suffering . Please don't let him continue to suffer in silence. His mental health will only get worse.

I myself suffer from generalised anxiety disorder. My anxiety is so bad that I have to run to the toilet whenever my anxiety gets past the normal level. I have been diagnosed with IBS as a result. During the period I lost my virginity, I had to take anti-diarrhea meds every day and cut down drastically on how much I ate. I lost so much weight as a result. Whenever I thought about being intimate with my ex, my bowels would die. It got so bad that I never ate when I was with him. We'd go on dinner dates where I'd just sit there and watch him eat. I only confessed to having IBS after four months of being together. He probably thought I had an eating disorder. Despite all that, I did manage to lose my virginity, although took several attempts at PIV due to the effects of my antidepressants, which ensured I was never turned on enough.

As someone who also blocks people out of their lives regularly due to severe anxiety and worry about what other people think of me, I would suggest you start reconnecting with your friend through baby steps. Send him short messages several times a week. Doesn't have to be super personal and he doesn't need to reply. You could just tell him about your day, send him a funny meme or if you know the sort of things he likes (favourite food, etc) you could say ""have you tried this?"". This approach is very likely to work. It will take time though. It's the approach I took with my ex who was suffering from clinical depression. He would sometimes just stop talking to me due to how badly he was feeling. He wasn't receiving any help or taking any meds, despite his diagnosis. I ignored his silence and kept messaging him throughout, because I understood it wasn't personal since I did the radio silence sometimes too with friends. According to my ex, it showed him that I did care about him and it did make him feel a bit better. He said it's also the reason why he fell for me as we had just been friends at that point.

Once he does start replying, you could just throw in some stories of awkward first times? It will help him feel better if he knows that it's quite common not to have the perfect first time. You could mention some of the experiences people mentioned here, like the ones where the person actually vomited. Feel free to mention my uncontrollable bowels and anti-diarrhea meds addiction.

depressed,fqwiwtl,t1_fqwe33b,1589706088.0,"You are very welcome. I'm not sorry it didn't work out with my ex. I'm actually in my second relationship now with someone I met a couple months after my breakup with my ex. We've been together for two years now. 

My view is that my relationship with my ex was supposed to happen. It was a learning experience for me that helped me overcome my fears. Thanks to that relationship I had all my ""firsts"" and I now know what I want in a relationship. 

The breakup was what I could have done without. It was very traumatic in itself, because my ex was very hurtful, cold and my worst nightmare. Had he actually been receiving therapy and/or was on medication, our breakup would not have gone the way it did. Thanks to the breakup I now have more things I also need to work on with therapy.

You are making the right decision. You are still quite young, so there is hope and time for you to find that special someone. You just need to work on yourself first to ensure that once you find that special someone, you are in a better position to maintain a relationship with them without your mental health problems stopping you."
depressed,fqw2ioe,t3_gl0qk5,1589691050.0,"This was me up until three years ago. I'm the opposite though, I had a very traumatic childhood and early adulthood. As a result of the trauma, I developed depression, severe anxiety, PTSD and haphephobia (fear of touching and being touched). Despite all that, I decided at the age of 27 that I'd had enough of being single and I was convinced that if I didn't do anything about it, I'd be single for the rest of my life.

I took up internet dating and ended up having my first adult relationship. Before this, I'd also just had quite a few first dates that didn't even end with a kiss. From the start of my relationship I was very open with my now-ex. I told him about the what I went through, how my mental illnesses affect me and how bad my haphephobia was. We agreed that we should just start out as friends because we both seemed to have a lot going on. He was also suffering from clinical depression and had previously been in five year relationship with an extremely abusive ex. It took us about three months from things to progress from just friends and once we started down that route, I began to struggle more.

My anxiety was so bad that, I wouldn't let him look at me head on. I was convinced that he was judging me negatively whenever he looked at me too intently, which triggered my panic attacks. Haphephobia meant that the thought of him touching me or me touching me also triggered panic attacks. The haphephobia was the hardest to deal with, because it meant the physical side of our relationship took a while to progress. My ex was very good about the whole thing. He decided that I needed exposure therapy, so introduced touch into our relationship by using baby steps. He started by hugging me often and holding my hand whenever we were out. Eventually I became fine with those aspects, but kissing was a whole different story. The haphephobia was still there for that and I was convinced that my lack of experience would cause my ex to leave me, therefore, wouldn't let him kiss me. He used exposure therapy for that too. He started off by regularly kissing me on the cheek and then proceeded to kiss me all over my face but avoided my lips. He was funny about the whole thing. At one point he was so desperate to kiss me, that he said he would kiss his hand and then I should kiss it after 😂. Eventually I think it got too much for him and he added light pecks to the lips whenever he was smothering my face in kisses. His exposure therapy worked and soon I was returning his kisses and learning how to kiss properly from him. Things naturally progressed to sex from there.

The journey to that point was really difficult and definitely one of the most anxious periods in my life. My ex's gentleness and understanding did help me overcome the barriers in our relationship, but so did medication. I decided to finally look into taking them, because I would also get panic attacks whenever I was about to meet my ex or whenever I was going to his and I knew we'd be alone. I knew that if the panic attacks continued, there was no way our relationship could ever progress. The medication helped reduce the panic attack feelings I was getting.

I think therapy would definitely help you. You'd also need to be open with potential partners, because that way you'd be able to weed out the time wasters. You need someone patient, kind and understanding to help you overcome your fears. It's definitely possible with baby steps and exposure therapy x

Edit: grammar

Edit 2: in case anyone is wondering, my ex and I broke up not because of my mental health issues, but because of his untreated mental illness. Despite being diagnosed with clinical depression, he never sought therapy or took any medication. I guess he assumed that he didn't need it, but turns out he was wrong because it caused the end of our relationship. Our relationship worked because I too had been incredibly accepting, understanding and forgiving towards the symptoms of his depression, but after a certain point it became too much. Naturally I got angry because it wasn't fair that I was constantly pushing myself to get better for the sake of our relationship, without him doing the same. He's now getting therapy and is taking medication, but of course it's far too late for us since I've already moved on. 

Moral of the story - therapy works. You can't expect to have a fulfilling and happy relationship if you don't address the problems you're having with professional help. Your partner should be your partner and not your therapist."

CPTSD,fqonc7k,t1_fqoilnt,1589519430.0,"It's illegal for HR to fire you once you disclose your condition and the difficulties it causes you. That's called discrimination (I'm a trainee lawyer). If they did fire or treat you unfavorably, you could take them to court for damages.

You do have other options. You could reach out to a third party organisation that actually speaks to employers on behalf of people like yourself. There's quite a lot of them out there. It's their job to ensure you're getting the support you need. Getting them involved means that HR can't fire or punish you without them getting involved. It gives you protection because it's not you vs your workplace. It's you supported by a specialist organisation vs your workplace. Mental health services usually have a list organisations like this that they can refer their clients to.

The other option is for you to request to see an occupational therapist. I'm not sure how the request for this one works. Might be through HR or your doctor. The occupational therapist would then do an assessment to see what type of support you need and pass it on to your employer for them to implement.

We all spend a lot of time at our workplaces to not get the support we need. Please don't suffer in silence.

CPTSD,fqnv1cg,t3_gjwlim,1589501954.0,"Yes! It's actually something that I've started being open about in the last five years. 

I ran away from my abuser with the help of a specialist organisation. The path to them only became clear after I finally stopped keeping the abuse silent and talked about it with my doctor, etc. After I ran away, I got placed in a women's refuge and put into group therapy for victims of domestic violence. Initially it was a very strange experience, I was used to keeping quiet about how I actually felt and how much I was struggling with simple day to day things. It took a while, and many group sessions, before I actually started to open up. I found once I started, it was easy to continue talking about it, but only with people I thought wouldn't judge me afterwards. I became very open with colleagues who were close friends in my previous jobs. It wasn't always easy. They didn't necessarily know how to react, but they were kind.

I never disclosed anything officially to my previous employers, because I know some would look for any old excuse to discriminate against you. I have been really open at my current job though. 

My colleagues and employers know I have been diagnosed with several mental illnesses, I'm on antidepressants and I struggle quite a lot with certain stuff and need their support regularly. It's a bit different with them, because we're a small charitable organisation. The size has enabled us to form familial bonds with each other. Everyone is really open about their health, problems with their lives, etc. It's always been that way, mainly because of my boss who recently passed away. He was a very open man. He always shared how he was feeling with us, talked about negative past events in his life, and made an effort to always check in on us. He was our unofficial office counsellor. He set the tone of the office and we all followed his example. It's honestly amazing. I love it. I love that I don't have to suffer in silence. I don't have to pretend I'm coping. I can admit when I'm struggling and ask for help, and know that my colleagues will step up to support me without judgement.

Have you thought about maybe just giving your team leader hints about why you're struggling if you're unable to do so directly? This is actually how I started opening up. I'd say things like ""I've been through some stuff, so I find things like this hard"". I always kept it vague because I felt scared to fully open up. You could maybe try saying, ""I'm really sorry I missed that. I was worried I'd get it wrong. I tend to overthink a lot because of stuff that's happened in the past"". 

Have you been diagnosed with poor mental health? Under employment law, your employers are obligated to put measures in place to assist you with your work - it's called reasonable adjustments. They can only do this if you actually tell them you need the help though.

I would advise you to either speak to your team leader at some point and say something like, ""hey, I find X hard because of some really bad things I've been through. Is there anything you can suggest that might help me do it better?"" Or you could request to speak privately with HR, who would then pass down the chain the type of support you need.

Reasonable adjustments is a life-saver. It's the reason why I haven't quit my job. Thanks to it, my employers changed my start times to cater for the side effects of my antidepressants, and reduced my hours because I couldn't work for long periods due to my severe anxiety. I wholeheartedly recommend you try it."

I've never fully understood what ""home"" I wanted to go back to, but at certain points in my life it meant different things. ""I want to go home"" may have meant from the ages 10-12, I want to go back to my mum. I lived with my mum in a third world country up until the age of 10, then I came to England to live with my dad. My life with my dad was hell because he was very abusive. The problem with the wanting to go home thought, was that life with my mum hasn't been great either. We were very poor, experienced homelessness during my early childhood, and my mum was very strict and quick to hit me whenever she thought I was misbehaving.

From the ages 12-20+, wanting to go home meant I wanted to die. That was when the abuse from my father became too much to bear.

For a brief period during my time as a 25 year old, going home felt like it meant I wanted to return to my abusive father. I ran away from him at this age and as scary and nerve wracking as the whole thing was, this wanting to go home feeling was the worst. I always ended up with really bad self hatred after. I didn't understand why I wanted to go back to a place where I couldn't even leave for leave, breathe, feel or think without permission.

My father used to put a lot of pressure on me to achieve academic success, because he taught college students for a living. That pressure ensured that I always an anxious mess every day and I could never prepare for exams because I was suffering from around 20 panic attacks a day. 

I did graduate college, but my law degree isn't worth much. I initially struggled to find work and went through quite a few shitty jobs because I had a lot of pressure from my father to start working immediately after I graduated.

The shitty jobs paid well, but due to mental illnesses I kept getting let go because at a certain point I couldn't even summon the will to get up for work. I hated the work, I couldn't concentrate on the what I needed to do because of how bad my anxiety was, and I hated my work environment because I struggled to fit in with my colleagues and was sometimes picked on.

I eventually got lucky and got offered a job at a all charity. Pay wasn't good and still isn't but I love it. Being a charity, the workforce is pretty small. There's around 9 of us in total and everyone is lovely. We're all people who decided to dedicate our lives to helping others. Everyone is really genuine, supportive and we're more like a family than colleagues. I've never once been treated badly despite how difficult I find things sometimes because of my mental illnesses.

I know you're worried about finding work, so I would suggest you try small companies and maybe charities. 

From my own experience, working for a large company will not be a good experience. Larger companies have more pressurised and toxic environments. Colleagues are prone to gossiping and bullying each other for fun and sometimes management will engage in that behaviour too. Your mental ill health will put a target on your back and make you more vulnerable to this behaviour, which I'm 80% certain will happen.

I work for a charity that actually gives people free legal advice. One of the areas of law we advice in is employment law, and it's incredibly upsetting how  many people we've had to help who have been treated like shit because of their mental health issues. I myself have been bullied by management and HR in a past job for seeking therapy."
CPTSD,fqfn5bm,t3_giglz9,1589327920.0,"29 year old female here. I know exactly how you feel. 

Long story short, I moved in with my dad at the age of 10 because he persuaded my mum it was best if he raised me. Worst decision ever. My father was extremely abusive, physically, emotionally, financially and psychologically. He was also a drunk for most of my childhood. I spent fifteen years living in what can only be described as hell. Every day I was insulted, slapped, controlled and trapped. I wasn't allowed to leave the house without permission, which was rarely given. I couldn't go out and have fun with my friends. I could barely see my mum because my dad hated her. Even prison must have been better than my life.

I was suicidal by the age of 12, but never gave in. The abuse I suffered at the hands of my father was never hidden. I was slapped and verbally abused in front of his wife, his family, his wife's family, his colleagues, his friends, our neighbors, random strangers in public, etc. No one ever did anything at all to help me. I basically grew up feeling like no one loved or cared about me apart from my mum. She was the only one that ever showed me any affection, and most of that was over the phone since I could rarely see her. For that reason alone, I decided to keep living for her. My dad also ruined her life and at the time she was suffering as much as I was. I promised myself that I would keep going for her. I would stay alive so that I wouldn't be another thing in her life that caused her pain. Her entire family abandoned her to go live abroad when she was 20, so I was actually the only family she had with her. If I killed myself then she'd be all alone in a country where the only person she thought she could turn to for support was my abusive father. That way of thinking kept me alive, but didn't stop me from wishing I was dead and spending every waking moment feeling hopeless and unhappy.

I honestly thought my life would never change unless: a) I did kill myself, b) my dad killed me like he'd promised to do, c) I killed my dad, or d) my dad died of natural causes, then my life changed. Throughout the years my mum used to always tell me that I could just leave my father. One day I finally found the strength to take her advice because I couldn't bear living like that any longer.

I sought help from a professional organisation that supports people in situations like I was in when I was 25 years old and they actually helped. They found me a place in a refuge and told me to pack my bags and prepare to secretly run away. That one small step I took to seek help was all I actually needed to do to change my life for the better. 

It's hard to believe how much my life has changed. Sometimes I feel like I'm living in a parallel universe. I have my own home, my mum is a permanent fixture of my life, I have my freedom and can do what the hell I want.

Unfortunately, as almost perfect as my life is right now, I'll never be able to fully enjoy it. Thanks to my father, I naturally ended up with depression, two anxiety disorders, PTSD and just general poor health that science has proved comes from a childhood of abuse. I will also most likely have to take antidepressants for the rest of my life.

On top of that, I have severe problems starting and maintaining relationships, both friendship and romantic relationships. I barely have any friends and the ones I do have, I neglect because part of me is scared of becoming reliant on people. I'm scared of getting too close to people, because I think they could one day hurt me like my father did. I even keep my own boyfriend at arms length.

In addition to that, I have a whole host of irrational fears. I have crippling social anxiety and am convinced 90% of the time that the people I care about don't actually care about me and will one day just disappear on me. I also avoid going into public on my own at all costs, because I have the social skills of a fish. My number one fear is that a random stranger will either try to talk to or attack me if I'm alone in public.

My father has stolen so much of life from me. Nothing in life is easy for me or will ever be easy. I too grieve for the person I could have been and all the opportunities I missed out on."
BorderlinePDisorder,fqfigz5,t3_ghy769,1589325482.0,"I'm in the same boat at the moment. My boyfriend and I have been together for going on two years now. 

We've never said I love you to each other or even had sex more than once. It's my fault. I was recovering from a really bad breakup when I met him and that set the tone of our relationship. I thought that if I kept my all emotions and insecurities close to my chest then he couldn't use them against me like my ex did. I thought that if I kept turning down his advances to sex then he wouldn't see me at my most vulnerable and I wouldn't have to miss him that way like I did my ex. We've also never spoken about our plans for the future in regards to our relationship. I don't even know if he wants to get married and have kids with me. I've been too scared to ask, because I'm convinced his future plans don't include me.

I'm regretting that so much now. Thanks to what's happening at the moment, I haven't seen him since February. We talk every day, but none of it is about how we feel or how much we miss each other.

I'm scared I won't see him again, because I lost my father figure in March, which proves none of the people I love are safe. What if something does happen to him and he never knows I love him? That's what happened with my father figure. He died before I could tell him he meant the world to me.

I was thinking of proposing to my boyfriend indirectly as a way of showing him how much he means to me if I do see him again, but that plan is on hold.

I haven't been diagnosed with BPD as yet, I'm waiting for assessment which is on hold until the mental health services start seeing people again. I'm convinced I have it because out of control my emotions always are. 

I've now come to see my plans to propose to my boyfriend may have just been me trying to find a way to tie him to me so that he'll have a harder time abandoning me. Problem is that I've already bought the ring. I don't even know what to do. Why am I like this. I feel so bad for my boyfriend having to be with someone like me that can't even tell him they love him."
CPTSD,fqe1ov1,t3_gi5xaz,1589300305.0,"OP I'm really happy you finally found a family that cares for you. I wish you many happy years with them.

For me it was my father who was extremely abusive and is the reason why I now suffer from depression, anxiety and PTSD. I finally managed to run away from him at the age of 25. Running away was really difficult. I didn't have a lot of close friends or family to support me. I'd always kept to myself since didn't want anyone to know about the abuse, and I was really mistrustful about getting close to people too. The only people who really supported me were my mum, a friend from high school and a family friend I wasn't very close to.

The family friend and I initially had an acquaintance type relationship. I'd met him through my abusive father, because he'd contacted him so I could get some work experience at his business. The family friend took me on and was nothing but nice to me. Despite the fact that I was bad at the work because of my mental health issues, he was nothing but supportive. He advised and supported me throughout my plans to run away. He also eventually offered me my first long-term job. During the three years I worked for him, he became my surrogate father, the father I'd always wanted.

He was loving, supportive, and always looking out for me. He called me his daughter, told me he loved me regularly and complimented me often. He did things my actual father never did. He never once looked down on me for struggling so much with simple things, because of my mental illnesses. He understood things were hard for me and praised me because he knew I was doing my best.

At the moment I'm struggling to cope with life, because he passed away in March from Covid-19. His loss has left a huge gap in my life and my heart. I miss him so much.

I'm so glad I met him, but I wish we'd had more time together."

I took the decision to cut my abusive father and his family out of my life four years ago, but occasionally my mum's family and family friends will try pressuring me to get back in contact with him. According to them I only get one father and he apparently loved me.

Some friends have also tried telling me I should get in contact with my father, because I should try to build a relationship with my little brother. My little brother was still a baby when I ran away. He has zero memories of me. Also, he's not my mum's child. 

No one seems to consider the effect this will have on me. Like I'm already suffering from GAD, social anxiety, depression and PTSD and can't get through my day to day life without taking antidepressants.

CPTSD,fq7bdr5,t3_ggpfih,1589144203.0,"Another academic failure here. I'm currently a trainee lawyer with a 2.2 law degree, which basically means my degree isn't really worth anything.

Bit about my background: my mum's highest education level was in secondary school and most of her jobs have been low paid working class jobs. Not surprising because she spent most of her life in a third world country where university isn't free and there's no loans or help available from the government.

My father on the other hand is very educated. He's from the same country as my mum, but came to England to study. He has two first class degrees, has previously worked for the government back home and is a university lecturer.

My father was my abuser. I came to England to live with him when I was 10 and my life was basically ruined because of that.

My father lived a middle class life and so did his family. All my cousins went to private school and got first class degrees. My father used to love comparing me them and called me the black sheep of the family. He also said I said I was far too stupid to graduate.

I was considered bright as a young child, but the moment the abuse started my education went downhill. I used to disassociate and daydream in class all the time. My concentration was shit and took me forever to learn anything.

I developed severe anxiety by the age of 12 and also had suicidal ideation. By the age of 13 I was suffering from social anxiety and panic attacks.

Despite my struggle with school, my father forced me to go to university. He picked the university, the degree and paid the fees. It's no surprise I did badly throughout. He constantly put pressure on me to do well, would demand I sit at my desk every night and do homework, didn't allow me out to house to see my friends or mum and didn't even allow me to do things like watch during the week. Naturally I rebelled. I barely did any homework and daydreamed and slept through my lectures. Whenever I did put any effort into my work I ended up having panic attacks. During exam time I sometimes had up to 20 panic attacks a day. The exams themselves were awful because my head would go blank and I would sometimes disassociate.

Despite all that, I've only ever failed three exams and passed a majority of the others without having ever finished a single exam paper.

I might be an academic failure, but I'm still proud of myself. I completed my degree despite living in hell and suffering from severe mental health issues. I never mitigated during my time at university, I didn't have any mental health support and wasn't on medication.

I used to always compared myself to the friends I had in uni and it used to make me hate myself so much. It also ruined my friendships, because I grew to resent my friends and their high grades and easy lives. I'm pretty sure they thought I was stupid and lazy, since I'd never disclosed my home situation or mental health problems - I was great at masking.

It took me a long time to forgive myself and stop beating myself up about how badly I did at uni. I may not have gotten perfect grades, but I worked hard and probably twice as hard as most of my friends because I had to compensate for my panic attacks.

I should say that science has also proven that childhood abuse results in poor educational achievement too."

I'm always struggled with my emotions, but just assumed it was a symptom of complex PTSD.

I also lost my father figure to covid-19 in March and it's affected me to my core. I've noticed that I have been quite clingy to the people I care about, like I'm refusing to let my mum go back to work because I'm scared she'll also catch covid-19 and leave me all alone (she's the only family I actually have). My boyfriend and I are also apart because of the lockdown. He's with his parents at the moment. I've been worried about losing him too and somehow this has lead me to planning to propose to him - like I've bought the ring and planned out how I will propose.

I've just contacted one of the mental health services that supports me and asked to be tested for BPD.

I definitely won't propose now until I figure out whether the proposal was just an overreaction to my current emotional state. Thank you - you might have just saved my relationship. My boyfriend and I don't even believe in the necessity of marriage!"

Some of us have gone through years of being told there's nothing wrong with us. Some of us are also from cultures that don't believe in mental health issues.

I myself am from a third world country that believes mental illnesses are something the privileged white man in the West invented to try and excuse their weak minds.

I am constantly told off by family members and family friends for having sought help for my mental health. I am also given shit for being on medication to manage said mental health issues. I am actually routinely told that I need to stop taking my medication and I should just focus on forgetting what happened to me, and I should put it all behind because I am strong and not weak. Somehow this is supposed to help me get better. I should say that these are things that are said by people who are from the same country as me but now live in West like me. Some of these people are even nurses here in the West. I guess you can take the person out of the third world country but you can't take the third world country beliefs out of the person.

adultsurvivors,fq5jn7j,t3_ggrikn,1589107943.0,"Is the perpetrator your father?

I know you think there's no way of escaping, but there is. I've posted my story a couple times on different boards, but it's quite long so I won't repost here. Long story short, I was the victim of domestic violence perpetrated by my father from the ages of 10 to 25. My father was basically abusive to every woman he had a close relationship to. He was abusive to my mum, his wife and even his sisters. Due to that none of them ever did anything to help me. I assuming they thought that since he treated them the same way then it was fine for him to treat his child that way too.

I never reached out for help. The abuse was never hidden and sometimes it happened in public. I guess I thought that since no one was helping that I should just accept my lot in life.

My mum was the only one who used to encourage me leave my dad. She broke off her relationship with him years ago, but had to keep in contact with him because I was living with him. One day I finally took her advice and ended up going to exactly the right place I needed to.

I went to a charitable organisation that supports victims of domestic violence and they were surprisingly able to help. At first I thought there was nothing they could do to save me and was fully prepared to go home and continue living the way I was. They refused to let me go home until they had found me a safe place live. The lady I spoke to made a couple calls to different organisations and eventually found me a place in a women's refuge. I got lucky. This was over the Christmas period, so a lot of organisations were closed for the holidays. 

I was given two days to pack my stuff, which I did in secret and then went to live in the refuge. Living there wasn't great, but I didn't have to pay rent since it's the government's responsibility to pay rent for places like refuges. I was safe there and they even helped me get free legal advice - I ended having to take my dad to court because he tried tracking me down through my work and friends.

I lived in the refuge for another nine months and then they eventually helped me secure government housing. I live in a one bedroom flat and my rent is cheap and easy to manage.

If you tell me the country you're in, I could try to find you the places you need to contact for help. There are refuges in every country and organisations dedicated to helping people in those situations.

Refuges will take anyone who has been a victim of violence. Doesn't matter your legal status, in some cases they help you sort out your legal status because some countries have laws that state citizenship needs to be granted to victims of domestic violence perpetrated by citizens of that country. Some also take families, so your mum would be able to go with you."

I'm just asking you to please read posts before making comments that could end up causing more harm than good. Please try be respectful and mindful of other mental illnesses.

Please try not to do it in future, because the effect you have on that person could end up leading to them not seeking help.

I'm only saying this, because I feel like you didn't consider the effect your comment would have on me. Not sure you know how general anxiety disorder works or anxiety disorders work, but people who suffer from them go through their every day life hearing ""normal"" people tell them that ""it's all in their heads"", ""they're overthinking"", ""they just need to stop worrying"", and other shit like that. It's the main reason why so many of us fail to seek help. 

I suffered in silence because of that from the age of 10 and didn't actually seek help until I was 25. At that point of course it was too late, I'd already lost most of my friends, almost failed uni and basically already hated my life. I only sought help because a kind person acknowledged that I did have serious problems with managing anxiety and needed to seek help.

I really hope one day people will stop telling people who are mentally ill that it's all in their own heads. Maybe then so many of them won't need to suffer in silence, like my close friends who have crippling anxiety but won't even seek help because I'm literally the only person in their lives that has actually acknowledged and pointed out that their way of thinking isn't ""normal"". 

Also, I'm already not healthy. I suffer from poor health due to having been a victim of domestic violence for a majority of my life.

You can't into it from the front of our building, because there's hedges in the way, but for some reason you can see into it from the main road we live on. It's the only open space we have that rarely has people.

After the first month of lockdown, I started feeling claustrophobic and really depressed. I wanted to go outside, but like you I don't like people staring at me. I decided to solve my problem by buying a tent. I pitched it up in the front courtyard and stayed inside for like 3 hours. People did pass by and I overheard comments, but they couldn't see me so had no idea who was inside. One person even commented that their boss does the same thing in his garden.

It's a bit of an unconventional solution, but a tent may work for you too? I'm assuming it won't look out of place either in your garden, whereas mine did because the courtyard is concrete. I got the tent from eBay. It's auto pop up and cost less than £40."
adultsurvivors,fpq8t6q,t3_getuj2,1588817495.0,"I'm so sorry you're both going through this.

This makes me so sad, because I can relate. My mum is a survivor of abuse perpetrated by my biological father. They got together when she was like 25 and then broke up after I was born. I then became a victim of abuse by my father at the age of 10, because he managed to convince t
her to let me live with him. She thought he'd changed. My abuse didn't end until I was 25 and had no choice but to run away from home. 

Initially I resented my mother so much for what happened to me, because my father was never secretive about the abuse. He would openly treat me like punching bag in front of family, friends and random strangers. No one ever did anything to save me. During that time my mum was the only one who ever showed me any love, but at the same time I couldn't help thinking that she should have saved me if truly loved me. I blamed her for everything. I also used to treat her really badly too. Whenever I was having a hard time with my dad, I'd end up taking it out on her.

It wasn't until I started taking medication and had a lot of therapy, that I started to realise I was wrong. I was wrong to blame my mum, because she was as much a victim as me. My father had actually been abusing us both at the same time. He would directly abuse me physically, but then abuse my mum indirectly through the phone. We were both abused, it's just mine was more noticeable and I'd been too young to pick up on hers.

Thanks to the damage my father caused both of us, we're both pretty up. We both have quick tempers, thin skins and get upset very easily. We argue so much because of our inability not to overreact. It's almost always awful when we argue, we say extremely hurtful things to each other. Some are things my father himself has said to us.

I always feel like shit afterwards. We never apologies to each other, but always seem to forgive each other without saying a word. Despite all that and all the horrible things we've said to each other, I know that I love my mum more than anything else in this world and she feels the same about me.

I think the only way to sort the issues out with your mum would be to seek help from a counsellor. I know there are some that deal with families.

You both just need a little bit of professional help. Please don't give up on her. She can't help the way she reacts. It'd not her fault. It's your dad's."
mentalillness,fppd3df,t3_geo1iy,1588800095.0,"Hi, I'm not sure this will work for you but have you tried contacting charitable organisations?

I work for a small charity in the UK and my job is basically to help people like yourself obtain essentials. I usually do this by approaching third party organisations and convincing them to hand over money to my clients for basic things like medical adaptations, clothing, furniture, etc. I'm certain there are similar organisations in the U.S. It might just take you some time to locate one.

I've just done a Google search and came across this https://simplefill.com/ and https://www.panfoundation.org/ . Please check them out to see if they can provide you with some help.

Good luck! I'm also on venlafaxine and would totally mail you some of mine if I could :(. Medication also costs a lot here too, even though healthcare is free. I really hate that contraception is free but essential medications aren't :/. Like thanks for the free contraceptive pill, but I'd rather have the free antidepressants so I can continue to keep myself  alive."
mentalhealth,fppakob,t3_geoh0a,1588798813.0,"Oh god, that's so awful. Your family are vile. I'm so sorry you went through that. 

I second the seeking legal advice. You really do need to. I'm a paralegal/trainee lawyer. I think you should quite easily be able to sue your dad for the settlement money and also your brother for compensation for the abuse you suffered in the civil courts. Combined the money may be enough to cover your college fees. Alternatively, you could try getting the court to force your family to continue paying your fees in a judgement or obtain a settlement from your family stating that you won't report your brother to the police unless they continue paying your fees. 

Civil cases are fairly easy and it's something you can do yourself. You might just need a little guidance from a lawyer, which you should be able to get for free. Have a look in your area and see if you can find a local free advice centre. There's usually one in every city."
adultsurvivors,fpp889i,t3_geqpf0,1588797654.0,"It sounds like you might have been.

I was a bit similar as a child. I knew the same things about sex at the age of 5 too and started masterbating at an early age. I don't know why. I originally thought that maybe it was because my adult relatives, who occasionally used to babysit me, used to not care about making sure there wasn't adult material on TV or lying around their place. That made sense up up to a certain point, but didn't explain how I knew details of what felt good.

Then a couple years ago, I randomly had a dream that I now believe was a flashback. It was of me being in my aunt's bed with her partner and he was touching me and my cousin inappropriately. I seemed to be really young. I'm convinced it was a memory, because a few years after that I overheard my mum talking to a family member about how my aunt's partner (now-ex) used to have sex with her daughter (aunt's child from previous relationship). My cousin was around 14 at the time or possibly younger. It seemed like her mum's partner took an interest in her and started an inappropriate relationship with her where he made her have sex with him whenever her mother wasn't around. I sometimes used to stay at their place after school while I waited for my mum to finish work, so it makes sense that he would have molested me too at some point.

I was also molested a few years after that again by my mum's friend's son. I think I was 8 at the time and he was 14/15. I also only started remembering that after having another random flashback dream. This one was a lot clearer, because my memories came back after the flashback and I remember a lot of details. Like he did it while we were sharing a bed, because we were having a sleepover at my mum's friend's place and the adults thought it would be okay to put the kids together. My mum thankfully stopped it, because she was actually sleeping on the bottom bunk and heard the bed moving.

It might be the same for you. In therapy we got taught that the human mind blocks out trauma completely sometimes because it's an automatic survival instinct. Maybe your brain thinks you're not ready to remember?

I also read somewhere that a lot of adults are actually abused as children and have no idea, partly because some parents and relatives disguise the abuse as being normal bath-time.

Have you spoken to a therapist about it? There might be a way of you remembering stuff through therapy?"

I spent so long wishing to die, believing I was a waste of space like my dad said I was, and thinking I didn't deserve to live.

It's Max Ehrmann's 'Desiderata' (Copyright 1952):

Go placidly amid the noise and haste,
and remember what peace there may be in silence.
As far as possible without surrender
be on good terms with all persons.
Speak your truth quietly and clearly;
and listen to others,
even the dull and the ignorant;
they too have their story.

Avoid loud and aggressive persons,
they are vexations to the spirit.
If you compare yourself with others,
you may become vain and bitter;
for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.
Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.

Keep interested in your own career, however humble;
it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.
Exercise caution in your business affairs;
for the world is full of trickery.
But let this not blind you to what virtue there is;
many persons strive for high ideals;
and everywhere life is full of heroism.

Be yourself.
Especially, do not feign affection.
Neither be cynical about love;
for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment
it is as perennial as the grass.

Take kindly the counsel of the years,
gracefully surrendering the things of youth.
Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.
But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.
Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.
Beyond a wholesome discipline,
be gentle with yourself.

You are a child of the universe,
no less than the trees and the stars;
you have a right to be here.
And whether or not it is clear to you,
no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.

Therefore be at peace with God,
whatever you conceive Him to be,
and whatever your labors and aspirations,
in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul.

With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,
it is still a beautiful world.
Be cheerful.
Strive to be happy."
mentalillness,fpm0yp6,t1_fplytdo,1588723334.0,"I know you think you have no one, but you're wrong. You have you. That's the one thing I've learnt from the hell I've lived through. No one ever cared enough about me to stop my father from abusing me, so I learnt pretty early on that the only one you can actually rely on in life is yourself. What's important in life isn't whether other people love you. It's whether you love yourself. 

There's no knight in shining armour that will come and rescue you. You have to rescue yourself. You have to be the one to take the steps to save yourself.

Screw your family. They might think you're not worth caring about, but they're wrong. Prove them wrong. Show them that it doesn't matter if they don't care about you, because you care about yourself and that's all that matters. You don't need them.

I'm assuming you're not on any medication or receiving any mental health support. If I'm right, then what you're feeling now is just temporary. Nothing in life ever stays the same. Life is always changing and it can get better if you give it a chance to.

The decision to start taking medication to manage my mental health was one of the best decisions I ever made in my life. It showed me that a lot of the negative things I was feeling and thinking were just caused by bad brain chemistry that had developed from the situation I'd been in. It's helped me and I believe it could help you feel better too.

Please try to seek mental health support, you owe it to yourself to try to change things for the better before you completely give up."
mentalillness,fplytdo,t3_gdyrnf,1588722116.0,"I've shared this on another thread before, but I think it might help you too:

I know exactly how you feel. I was in the same position three years ago, for fifteen years. Long story short, I moved in with my dad at the age of 10 because he persuaded my mum it was best if he raised me. Worst decision ever. My father was extremely abusive, physically, emotionally, financially and psychologically. He was also a drunk for most of my childhood. I spent fifteen years living in what can only be described as hell. Every day I was insulted, slapped, controlled and trapped. I wasn't allowed to leave the house without permission, which was rarely given. I couldn't go out and have fun with my friends. I could barely see my mum because my dad hated her. Even prison must have been better than my life. 

I was suicidal by the age of 12, but never gave in. The abuse I suffered at the hands of my father was never hidden. I was slapped and verbally abused in front of his wife, his family, his wife's family, his colleagues, his friends, our neighbors, random strangers in public, etc. No one ever did anything at all to help me. I basically grew up feeling like no one loved or cared about me apart from my mum. She was the only one that ever showed me any affection, and most of that was over the phone since I could rarely see her. For that reason alone, I decided to keep living for her. My dad also ruined her life and at the time she was suffering as much as I was. I promised myself that I would keep going for her. I would stay alive so that I wouldn't be another thing in her life that caused her pain. Her entire family abandoned her to go live abroad when she was 20, so I was actually the only family she had with her. If I killed myself then she'd be all alone in a country where the only person she thought she could turn to for support was my abusive father. That way of thinking kept me alive, but didn't stop me from wishing I was dead and spending every waking moment feeling hopeless and unhappy.

I am so glad I managed to find something to anchor my life to. Just when I thought my life would never change unless: a) I did kill myself, b) my dad killed me like he'd promised to do, c) I killed my dad, or d) my dad died of natural causes, my life changed. Throughout the years my mum used to always tell me that I could just leave my father. She never understood that it wasn't that easy. Eventually she got through to me. She gave me the right advice. She  told me to look for someone who could give me advice, so I did. 

I sought help from a professional organisation that supports people in situations like I was in and they actually helped. They found me a place in a refuge and told me to pack my bags and prepare to secretly run away. I thought they were crazy. I told them it would never work. I had lived my life for 15 years, there was no way it could be that easy to get out. They essentially took the decision out of my hands and my mum was there to ensure I did exactly what I was told. They were right. Just like that I managed to escape from my nightmare. It took a hell of a lot of courage to escape and the first year was hell, mainly because I had to take my dad to court to protect myself. 

That one small step I took to seek help was all I actually needed to do to change my life for the better. It's hard to believe how much my life has changed. Sometimes I feel like I'm living in a parallel universe. I have my own home, my mum is a permanent fixture of my life, I have my freedom and can do what the hell I want. My life is by no means perfect, because naturally I ended up with depression, two anxiety disorders, PTSD and just general poor health that science has proved comes from a childhood of abuse. I also still had days where I felt life wasn't worth living, but it isn't as bad as before. I'm on antidepressants and it's helped a lot with the suicidal thoughts. It's helped me finally feel happy.

My life's not perfect, but it's still a better life than I had before. I'm glad I stayed alive, because it's proved that life can get better. Things can change.

I know you feel like things are hopeless and they won't get better, but believe me they will. You just need to hold on a little bit longer and know where to turn to for help. There are so many people out there who don't know who you are, but they are willing to bend over backwards to help you and support you."
socialanxiety,fpjecye,t3_gda0qf,1588665423.0,"I second that - script it as best as you can and then push the call button when you feel semi-ready. I find sometimes that having the TV on in the background helps, because it stops me from focusing 100% on the conversation and decreases my chances of having a panic attack. Pacing before and during the call also helps me a lot. I find that its a good way of working off the excess anxious.

I've been lucky in that regards. Thanks to the lockdown I've been able to make better use of the app by doctor's surgery uses. There are now more slots for telephone appointments available. I'm so glad I don't have to make the calls, but waiting for the call at the allotted time is a bit scary too."

Please do give meetup a try too. Once the pandemic calms down it'll be easier to meet people face to face using that. You can do a search for groups in your area too. 

Meetup groups also tend to use the website itself to talk to members. You could try using that feature to just make small talk with people and see if anything develops from there."
depressed,fpiippu,t3_gdmf93,1588641731.0,"Don't give up. Keep trying. The thing to remember is that friendships can't be forced it needs to happen naturally. I would suggest that you start small by making small talk for couple minutes, then do the same thing the day after and the day after that.

Reddit doesn't seem the best place to make friends, since it's more of a opinion board thing.

I actually have crippling social anxiety and my worst day to day fear is that someone I don't know will talk to me. It's pretty surprising that I have a good small group of friends given how bad I am at interacting with people. It took a long time/many years for me to get the hang of making friends, but eventually I met the right people. Please have hope. It might not happen this month, but if you keep looking in the right places you're bound to find some like minded people."
depressed,fpihufr,t1_fpigs6b,1588641214.0,"Have you tried bonding with people with similar interests? I found that it's actually surprising easy to make friends with people if you both love the same thing. For example, I made friends with my best friend by literally just talking about anime. I also made quite a few friends by just joining blog communities and talking to people about tv shows I liked like Glee, Merlin and Teen Wolf. My current boyfriend and I also initially bonded over a love for fantasy books. 

Do you game? If you don't, I would recommend you take it up. Online gaming is one of the easiest way to make friends. People who game also tend to be introverted and sometimes socially awkward, for that reason it makes it easier to talk to them. There's no pressure and it's really chilled out. There's also loads of gaming groups who have discord channels. Good MMOs to try are games like Final Fantasy XIV, Elder Scrolls online, Overwatch, GTA V, Fortnite, etc."

I think you would benefit from talking therapy. Most places always offer group therapy as the initial therapy. It could help connect with people who feel similarly.

I also know some mental health services have links to social group/group activities for people like yourself. 

Have you also thought about making friends on dating websites, blogs or apps like bumble?

I used to feel similarly, isolated without any friends and had trouble connecting with people in my day to day life. What helped was that I started joining blogs websites and dating type sites just to see if I could find people who had similar interests as me to see if I could make friends that way. It worked. I made friends through websites like livejournal and Tumblr who liked the same TV shows as me. I also started playing MMO PS4 games and made friends through gaming who weren't even in the same country as me. I also made friend and eventually started dating people from dating websites who had similar interests and hobbies as me. 

I would also recommend you join meetup.com. It has  lots of group catered to people with different interests. I've found that it can be an easy way to make friends. Some groupsbregularly had group meetups where you can go along and join in. There's almost always a couple new people at each session. I myself am a fan of the table top board game groups. They are always filled with friendly people and quite a few people seem to create their friendship groups from people they regularly see and play with there.

Seeking therapy also helped me a lot. I've had a couple sessions of group therapy and it helped me learn to connect to people in day my day to life.

Some of these may be on hold ATM because of what's going on, but I would suggest you give bumble and meetup a try"

I had a similar thing. My father paid for my university education, so I used to convince myself that taking his abuse was my only option because it was the only way I could do my degree. I was wrong. I could have easily gotten student finance and a government grant to fund my education, just like all my friends did.

As for shopping, you'd be able to go out on your own. Although, you'd most likely end up with a support worker to help you do that if you felt unable to do it on your own.

I know what you mean though, I was the same when I was with my dad. Sometimes the only thing I could control was brushing my teeth, so I wouldn't do it.

The good news is that things like that can be treated with medication. I'm on antidepressants and it's almost completely stopped my panic attacks and my severe anxiety is mostly under control. My depression has also improved."

I've just done some research on them and they do have connections to refuges - places you can move into to escape your parents.

Refuges also ensure that you are safe and supported. If you do go down that route then you'll have a support worker and the refuge will make sure that you are protected from your parents.

Again, refuges are places you can live in for free. The government will pay for your rent and financially support you."

Can I just ask how old you are? It'll help me find the right services for you. If you're 18, you can actually essentially find your own place to live. There's special accommodations called refuges designed for people in these situations. The government covers the rent, so it's basically a free place to live until you're able to set your life up.

I believe there are also similar places for under 18s too.

Also, I'm in England so we have the same system. Should be easy for me to find somewhere to direct you."

Throughout the years my mum used to always tell me that I could just leave my father. She never understood that it wasn't that easy. Eventually she got through to me. She gave me the right advice. She  told me to look for someone who could give me advice, so I did. 

I sought help from a professional organisation that supports people in situations like I was in and they actually helped. They found me a place in a refuge and told me to pack my bags and prepare to secretly run away. I thought they were crazy. I told them it would never work. I had lived my life for 15 years, there was no way it could be that easy to get out. They essentially took the decision out of my hands and my mum was there to ensure I did exactly what I was told. They were right. Just like that I managed to escape from my nightmare. It took a hell of a lot of courage to escape and the first year was hell, mainly because I had to take my dad to court to protect myself. 

That one small step I took to seek help was all I actually needed to do to change my life for the better. It's hard to believe how much my life has changed. Sometimes I feel like I'm living in a parallel universe. I have my own home, my mum is a permanent fixture of my life, I have my freedom and can do what the hell I want. My life is by no means perfect, because naturally I ended up with depression, two anxiety disorders, PTSD and just general poor health that science has proved comes from a childhood of abuse. I also still had days where I felt life wasn't worth living, but it isn't as bad as before. I'm on antidepressants and it's helped a lot with the suicidal thoughts. It's helped me finally feel happy.

My life's not perfect, but it's still a better life than I had before. I'm glad I stayed alive, because it's proved that life can get better. Things can change.

I know you feel like things are hopeless and they won't get better, but believe me they will. You just need to hold on a little bit longer and know where to turn to for help. There are so many people out there who don't know who you are, but they are willing to bend over backwards to help you and support you. That includes me.

I was so grateful to the organisation that saved me, that I've basically dedicated my life to working for a charity that offers free legal advice and support to people in need.

If you tell me the country you're in, I could try and find services that can help you."

Adulting,fpb1965,t3_gcdwly,1588459987.0,Today! I finally remembered to call nowtv during the day to renew my broadband contract. I even managed to make the call without having an anxiety attack. So proud of myself.
sex,fpau9ig,t3_gcbvs3,1588455833.0,"It seems to hurt for most women, so I'd say prepare for it to hurt. I actually started using sex toys long before I started having sex. I guess you could say I technically lost my v card to a toy, but even that hurt. Like a lot. I bled afterwards too. The first time I had sex with a man was quite painful as well. The first couple times we tried to have sex, he had to stop because it hurt too much when he tried penetration. We eventually got the hang of it with the help of lube, lots and lots of lube and preparation before penetration. Even now I still can't have sex without lube and preparation. 

I do have a friend who also took her v card with a toy. She bought a very small bullet and used lube. She said it was painful and she didn't get very far the first couple of times. It took her a couple of times and a lot of lube to get there.

You do definitely need to find a way of preparing before you rush into it. Another one of my friends isn't one for preparation, so she's still a virgin. She has had a lot of bfs, but penetration has never worked out. Her bfs have all been experienced, but not used to virgins so they didn't know what to do to help her. She's now really scared to try penetration, because if how much it hurt during each attempt. She said she's just going wait until marriage, because of how traumatic it's likely to be for her.

I would suggest that your partner starts with oral or fingering with lots of lube. You should do that a couple times, so you get used to the stretch before you attempt penetration. Preparation is key. You can actually injure yourself if you don't prepare well enough. Not all vaginas are the same either. Some women have vaginismus and don't realise until they actually start having sex."
Anxiety,fpago1u,t1_fpafhqk,1588447783.0,"Please do. It could be that your medication has stopped working as well as it used to at managing your anxiety? I've been told that it happens a lot with antidepressants. It does make sense for it to be an increase in anxiety rather than a side effect, since you've been on the meds for so long. I hope your psychiatrist is able to help."
Anxiety,fpafleq,t3_gc2qqq,1588447149.0,"The most important thing to remember is that you don't have to talk to anyone if you don't want to. If you're able to, just smile and say hi to every new person you meet. If they ask you any questions, one word answers are totally ok. If you start to feel overwhelmed, then excuse yourself and pretend you either need to make a call and go to the bathroom. You could also try attaching yourself to the person you know a bit. I guarantee that they'll be willing to talk to you, because they're in the same boat and may be nervous if they're just starting the job too. Good luck!"
Anxiety,fpact0i,t3_gc88ay,1588445490.0,"I have this too, but it's mainly focused on my mum. She's kind of the only family I'm in touch with, which is why. It started as low level anxiety whenever she was out late at night either because she was working late or went to visit a friend. I used to worry like crazy that she'd been stabbed by one of the terrible young people you see on the news regularly. Then it got a lot worse. Thee years ago we were on the way home from visiting a friend and ended up witnessing a car accident. A young woman was brutally hit by a speeding police that was rushing to an emergency. She survived, but it had a major effect on my anxiety. No I get scared that my mum will get hit by a car whenever she's out without me. Sometimes when she's out late, I'll call and text her multiple times to see if she's okay. She doesn't always reply, because sometimes she's having fun with her friends. Those nights are the worse, because I end up having panic attacks and staying up the whole night until I hear from her. It's the worse."
Anxiety,fpabew1,t3_gc8saq,1588444668.0,"You're definitely not the only one. I had it really badly from February to April. I felt so incredibly dizzy whenever I got up from sitting or from bending down. It was awful. I told my doctor because it was really scary, but he said that it was just my anxiety. I'd recently changed meds and was on a really low dose to start with. My anxiety and the dizziness were pretty bad until my dose increased. Have you changed meds recently?"
sex,fp9fp2g,t3_gc31ie,1588424930.0,"What happens in your head when you're using your vibrator or having sex? I've never climaxed during sex with a guy, but I have by myself using toys. I've realised that a lot of it is to do with your mind. I've read that it's that way for some women. You need to be in a specific head space. I almost always have to use porn or I won't orgasm. I end up getting lost in my thoughts without it. What helps me is to focus on the sexual act of what I'm doing and on the acts the people are doing in the porn. It might not work for you, but watching porn that had women masterbating helped me a lot.  I think it helped me connect that what I was doing was pleasurable and stopped me from getting sidetracked. You could maybe try watching videos of men masterbating instead though?"
sex,fp9edul,t3_gc22mo,1588423889.0,"I can relate. I felt that way about penises before I lost my virginity to my ex. My ex had no idea, but he ended up coaching me through it while helping me get past my anxiety towards sex. I second the exposure therapy and doing it in the dark. It actually works. I always had sex with my ex in the dark and it made it so much easier to get used to his penis. He spent a lot of time showing me how to touch it and eventually I ended up getting past my aversion to the point where I enjoyed touching it because of his reactions. Do it in the dark and try not to think about what you're doing. Focus instead on the pleasure you're feeling and the pleasure you're giving your girl. Let me know if you ever get to the point where you can do it with the lights on. I still haven't reached that point."
sex,fp9d79w,t3_gc2r1m,1588422891.0,"It's a perfectly normal reaction. Don't worry about it. I've been using toys for the past 10 years. Always had the same reaction to a new toy at the beginning. I'm on antidepressants now and it's killed my libido quite a bit. I really miss those days. Have fun and remember to take breaks to hydrate, eat, sleep, etc."
sex,fp9bwry,t1_fp8fd2u,1588421729.0,"I didn't think it was pressuring at all. You were very encouraging. It was helpful. Thank you. I'm sorry you had a similar bad experience with your ex. You've given me hope though, because you managed to work past it. I'll keep trying to push past my insecurities too. You are right, that is the worse thing that can happen. In my heart I don't think he'd react that way either, it's just hard to think logically because of how bad my anxiety is. I do owe it to both of us to see things through to the end. If it ends badly then it ends badly, I've technically been preparing for that for the past two years.

I'm a bit introspective at moment. I lost someone close to me and it's made me realise life is short. I do need to stop letting my past relationship stop me from enjoying my current one. We're currently apart at the moment, but I'll keep your words in mind when we're together again. I've even screenshot it.

I did get very lucky with him. He's from a very traditional religious family. He's never pressured me at all. He's very respectful. The most he does is let me know through small touches that he would like to take things further, but he slows things down the minute I pull back. He's very gentle with his touches too. He's won't touch me sexually without first checking from my reaction if it's okay. I can tell his frustration has been slowly building though, even though he won't say anything or pressure me. The poor guy. I'll try really hard to make the next attempt at sex go better. Finger crossed."
sex,fp9b2k5,t1_fp8wq08,1588420930.0,"That is very helpful. Thank you. I do find writing things down a lot easier than speaking them verbally. The reason I haven't been able to discuss it with him is because I'm terrified I won't get the words out and I'll end up having a panic attack. I'll make one more attempt at sex with him and if I struggle to get past my insecurities, I'll write down the problems I'm having and pass it to him. At least that way we'll be able to work on it together."
sex,fp9au92,t1_fp8tuk9,1588420708.0,"He is pretty great and I do love him a lot. I've had s lot of counselling before. The problem is that because I have so much trauma, my counselling has just been focused on getting me to accept the trauma, so that I can lead a normal life. I'm on the waiting list for anxiety counselling at the moment. I'll definitely bring up the problems I'm having with my relationships in that one. Hopefully they'll be able to help."
sex,fp98qqh,t1_fp8gq54,1588418603.0,"I got very lucky with him. I think the reason why he's never pushed me, is partly because of his personality and also partly because he understands the way mental illnesses work. His brother also has the same mental illness as me, except he struggles a lot more. I'm ""high-functioning"". I can lead a semi normal life and hold down a job, despite how bad my mental health is. His brother, unfortunately, can't. I'm very grateful for his understanding. Our relationship wouldn't have lasted this long without it. Even though I struggle to be open with him about the intimate side of our relationship, I've tried to be open about how my condition affects me.

I know, sex with my ex was fun. I do hate that I am denying my bf and myself that experience. Your advice about focusing the positives was quite useful. My main hurdle is my head. I find it hard not to get trapped in my insecure thoughts when my bf starts to initiate sex. Next time I will do what you said, I will try to think think about the fact that we do both love each and how getting past this will improve the future our relationship. I've spoken to my friends about it in the past, but their advice has mainly just been that I need to push past it. They didn't seem to get that I have been trying, it's my head that's the problem and I didn't know how to stop thinking so negatively. Your advice is very practical, thank you. I really do appreciate it."
