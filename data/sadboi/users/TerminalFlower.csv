You'd just have to have a suitable grow light, which is a good idea for any indoor succulent collection imo. I've got two Ghost Plant rosettes and while they're not a pink variety they are still very pretty and easy to care for."

Mindfulness,f7jh7b5,t3_dwcedg,1573777542.0,"Honey listen. It is absolutely normal for your mental health to suffer based on political events if you know the outcome of those events is going to negatively affect the lives of you or your loved ones.  I am right here with you - one of the worst depressive bouts of my lifetime (and I've had chronic depression for as long as I can remember) was directly related to a major political event, the outcome of which caused physical and mental harm to many women; since my work is centered around other women it's impossible for me to ignore. It is normal and admirable to be a person who cares about the wellbeing of those around you.

What has helped me is to focus on helping others. You may not be able to control things on a large scale, but it will absolutely temper your distress if you're able to take steps to do good on a small scale. Trust me on this. I know how awful and hopeless it may seem. The best thing you can do for yourself and others you're worrying about would be to find a way to help them. It will keep you busy and is very rewarding. There are programs online that will let you pitch in in so many ways. You can't save the world but you can make a difference in different people's lives and it's 100% worth it."

succulents,f7g6bih,t1_f7g3dqc,1573695674.0,"I'm not familiar with pachyphytum personally, but I've heard they can be temperamental. Many plants will react to a sudden change in environment (like taking them home from the store, which might have had different lighting/temperature) by dropping leaves. Many also behave this way after repotting, too. Unless the leaves on the plant itself are turning black/yellow and mushy I'd say it's probably just throwing a hissy fit, haha."

namenerds,f74vdba,t1_f72gye1,1573408526.0,"This is an important thing that many people are quick to forget. There were people named River before any of those fandoms existed. The fandoms didn't create that name, and an adult having that association now isn't really reflective of how tiny children are going to react. A 'classic' name could be given to a widely-known character tomorrow and it doesn't mean people with that name have to immediately go fill out a name change form just to try to evade the association.

My niece's name is River. Not one of the other kids in her class has had the ""whoa like River from Serenity/Who/etc?!"" reaction and neither have their parents. And if by some chance they did, it doesn't make it a less valid name choice bc there's a chance someone will think of a fictional character when they hear it. idk I get wanting to spare a kid some headaches but in most cases I feel like there's a major overreaction."

succulents,f5oczo4,t3_dogbay,1572315126.0,"Ohh! Hey again! haha

The brown spots look like sunburn to me, but could also be indicative of extreme underwatering if it's been weeks and weeks since the plant got a good drink. Cutting the spots off the leaves isn't necessary; new growth will come out and cover those leaves in time! Cutting leaves will expose the inner tissue of the plant and might invite rot, kinda like how you're more likely to have a cut get infected if you keep picking the scab off your skin.


The 50/50 perlite/soil mix is great and both plants will be much happier that way. As for grow lights, I'm gonna be honest with you, I wouldn't bother with the red/blue ones at all. We're finding as time goes on that it's the brightness of the light, not red/blue wavelengths, that keep plants healthy. It would be better (and most likely more affordable) to find a white LED bulb with a high lumen rating and pop it into a lamp you've got, or a cheap basic fixture can be found anywhere from thrift stores to amazon if you don't have any lying around.

[This kinda bulb](https://www.amazon.com/ecoBright-Light-2700lm-Crystal-non-dimmable/dp/B0172AVI7Y/) should do fine for a small collection. I think Sansi is a brand that makes grow bulbs specifically and is recommended by a couple bloggers but at the end of the day a lot of companies just slap ""grow light"" on packaging as an excuse to jack up the price, so don't worry if whatever you end up getting isn't advertised as being for plants. Mine are all under a white LED shop light and happier than they've ever been."

nosurf,f5czxzm,t3_dn5ymu,1572146101.0,"I think about this a lot.

I've asked for the same courtesy from others and been laughed at in response, lol. It's as though we are reacting to each other as characters rather than having interactions between human beings. 

What bothers me most is that we reward each other for this, even unintentionally. The wittier the comment, or the better the 'burn', the more validation that person receives (in the form of upvotes, messages, et cetera). It's unhealthy, to say the absolute least..."

If your window sill is the part of your room that gets the most light then definitely have it close by! If the window gets drafty or cold I wouldn't sit it on the sill, but as much light as possible is best for sure. If it's unhappy it'll let you know :)"

garden_maintenance,f5a93cy,t3_dn69tx,1572102740.0,"Do you have pictures of your succulent? We might be able to help ID it and give more specialized care tips! But here's the basic stuff:

1) Repot after purchase into a grittier soil mix (cactus/succulent soil + perlite works wonderfully, 50/50 mix); the soil that you get them in is fine short-term but the plant will be much happier growing in a soil mix that drains better and minimizes the chance of root rot. The pot must also have a draining hole. Terracotta is great.

2) Water only when the soil is completely dry. Eventually you'll be able to know when your plant needs water by how light or heavy the pot is, or by how the plant itself looks, but when you're brand new to them a good rule of thumb is that if you can stick your finger into the soil (or a wooden skewer or long toothpick! those disturb the pot a lot less, haha) and it's dry + comes out clean, you can probably water it safely. Water either at the base of the plant or try ""bottom watering"", since letting water sit on the leaves can lead to rot.

3) LIGHT! Put your succulent wherever it'll get the most sunlight. You might need to acclimate it though - if it was sitting inside a store under artificial lights then it might burn if suddenly transitioned to direct sunlight, in which case you'd move it closer to the sunlit area over the course of a week or two. But sunlight through a window is less intense than if you were to keep the plant outside, so you'll probably be fine. If the plant starts looking stretched or leggy (has a lot of space between the leaves when the variety is meant to be more compact) or loses its color, it's telling you it needs more light.

Hope that helps!"

Joan's dialogue at the very end explains everything that happens but wasn't originally in the film iirc, and was added to minimize confusion... but some folks still came out of it feeling like they didn't understand, somehow. It wasn't a super complex narrative either so I was really surprised to see so many saying it didn't make sense to them."
privacy,f4hf1qw,t1_f4ezv49,1571590892.0,"I don't mean to sound like a conspiracy theorist here, but... that is exactly what they want to hear. They push the whole 'if you're not guilty then why do you care?' thing, and our privacy is eroded as a result. It's the principal of the matter. What you say to your friend is no one else's business, regardless of what you talk about. You know? I felt like it didn't matter once but that kind of attitude really opens the door to normalizing a complete loss of privacy."
