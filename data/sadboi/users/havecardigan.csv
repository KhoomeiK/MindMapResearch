DuggarsSnark,fns50yl,t1_fns4t5p,1587212851.0,No thanks. Pretty positive those observations have been made here before. And I am pretty positive no matter what I said you’d decide I am terrible.
DuggarsSnark,fns41ie,t1_fns3zim,1587211967.0,I said “more” normal - in comparison to the rest of them.
DuggarsSnark,fns3dvy,t1_fnrf8f3,1587211367.0,"I agree. There are so many other things to snark on that are far less toxic and actually relate to crappy, bigoted beliefs, fake martyrdom or even just really unfortunate homemaking. Making fun of how someone looks bothers me no matter what (no one is safe here, even babies I guess) but this comparison kind of takes the cake - considering Abbie is probably one of the more normal Duggar family members (or, as good as it is going to get)."

FundieSnark,fl9z5v5,t3_fnel27,1584972994.0,"Realistically - many probably think they can.

 Just like they think their belief systems are solely correct and hating people they don't know is also the only way to go. I think that there is this assumption that they are aware and/or care about others' opinions. They either enter those attacks (that they know about) into the martyr arsenal so that they can be further convicted and more deeply committed (deluded) to their own mindset or they have no frame of reference on what other people consider good food, clean homes and educated families.

Honestly, I am not so much concerned about hating on what people like to eat (a tale as old as a time) but rather what seems to be a food scarcity or starvation aggrandizing in the name of appearance or godliness (Gwen Shambalambadingdong)."

FundieSnark,ff5s5zf,t3_erok8u,1579608186.0,"I dated a Mormon guy (well, he was a sinner that dated me. His parents were Mormons). Visiting their house in Utah, the first thing to take in were the dozens of post-it notes with messages about how God was the most important - and that relationship trumped all, very specifically including parenthood. The second thing to take in was a life-sized painting of Jesus at a tea party with two little girls that took up an entire wall. 

It became clear immediately I wasn’t dealing with healthy people. 

In another vein, I grew up with a codependent mother and an alcoholic stepfather - so being second (or third or whatever), happens. Thank goodness for therapy. And realizing I have no business being a mother until I raise myself."

I often think the bollocks women in these groups are sold is akin to a secret society they will enter upon the loss of virginity - as if there is a handshake and badge that will be delivered when the home office receives word that it’s happened. 

The realities of the building of intimacy with a partner (or, more than one partner in a lifetime for us dirty whores), aren’t a secret club’s imparted wisdom - it’s a product of effort, fun, missteps, lust, patience and time.

Edit: a phrase"

The implications of binary gender identity and sexual orientation being limited to gay/bi/straight - is not only a microaggression, but it is a poorly researched heteronormative narrative that excludes hundreds of thousands of people that live as their authentic selves outside of the bounds of the views of this narrow sub's limitations to the topics.

Is Josiah Queer? Who knows, but the likelihood that at least one of the Duggar family is isn't anything to shake a stick at. I hope that if that is the case with any of them, that they eventually find the support that will help them."
