PS4,f3ztufz,t1_f3zt6th,1571276862.0,"I’ve even let it sit out for a whole 24 hours and it did nothing. 

And I mean a new hard drive is way cheaper than a new PS4. The thing I’m most concerned about is all my data. Been playing overwatch almost since launch and I cant imagine losing everything, spent almost $300 on the game alone. 

And I feel like the problem is coming from an internal problem so a HDD won’t do much.

Well thanks for the help anyways."

depression_help,ethzvco,t1_ethzdbd,1562832959.0,My ex was really manipulative and told me self harm is ok. Only until about 2 months ago I stopped self harming. My bestfriend in 8th grade commited suicide and he was always joyful and funny. Despite having both my parents we hardly speak to each other so I don’t have a connection at all with my family really. And everytime I seek help from a friend they think I do it for attention. And what I hate about the last part is that I’m never posting “I’m depressed” or anything depressing on my story and I almost never talk about it. I don’t see how it’s for attention.
