I have been watching tv shows and movies all my life like anyone else. I grew up watching male characters that are over powered, never die, always the hero, always saving a female. I grew up watching shows and movies that include 90% white cast. I spent my childhood thinking that I a female that is a minority have no representation in those universe the movies and shows portray. I felt I don't deserve to be a hero like that guy from that movie. I felt I can't possibly be saving someone because I'm a female that always needs saving. I grew up feeling that people from my country have no place in this world or this community. I felt excluded. 

Now people like me are being represented. Females are almost getting the same treatment men got for years in the movies/tv shows. I finally feel included. I know my children will grow up feeling included and represented and that they belong. 

To you it doesn't matter, to us it means the world. 

Overpowering any character is stupid. But white men were that throughout the years so I think it's only fair for women and diverse characters to get that too.
