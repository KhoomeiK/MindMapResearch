transgenderUK,fqgs248,t1_fqeil3c,1589355261.0,"OK but this is a fucking mood. I've had this absolutely debilitating pelvic pain on and off since mid-late 2017, not long after I started T, and after many rounds of bloods and ultrasounds and smears they're like, 'might be endometriosis. Good chance, actually.' I was super relieved and was like, great! So since I'm in so much pain and never ever want children, can I get a hysto?

Turns out, no, I can't. Even though my pain is probably endometriosis, you know, a condition vast swathes of cis women suffer from and for which hystos are semi-routinely performed, it has to go through a GIC and be covered by GIC funding, because I'm trans. 

I have been on the waiting list for Leeds since January 2019. They told me I would probably not be seen until January 2022 (though probably later now, because of you-know-what). Even though I've stopped T and my periods haven't come back ~~yet,~~ my pain is so bad it has me crying and bent in half on the floor on the verge of throwing up for literally hours at a time, multiple days a month, with twinges ranging from a one to a four on the pain scale about a third of the rest of the days of the month. It spreads into my back and legs and feet. OTC painkillers do nothing, heat does nothing. Can't do shit about it though, because trans. I have at least another two-ish years of this.

Literally makes me want to die sometimes."
