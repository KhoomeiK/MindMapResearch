> You're white and have an opinion that values the supremacy of white opinion over the chorus of opinions of POC. How is that not racist?

It's not because that's literally not what I said. Ever. I never made this a competition of who has the better opinion or said that my white opinion is better than anyone else's, or that POC's opinions don't matter... Open discourse involves everyone's opinions and doesn't discount anyone's because of their skin color. My opinion was the antithesis of racist, it was equality oriented since I feel everyone's opinions matter on this who are involved - yes, including white people. If that makes me racist, then that pretty much shows how far we have to go collectively as a society towards tolerance and equality.

> Whataboutism escapes the present conversation. This is the bachelor subreddit, and we're discussing the present wrong. You don't know how I engage with these discussions elsewhere.

And this present wrong and conversation involves the history of oppression towards black people, so it was a relevant question since many POC turn a complete blind eye to other slave trades that persisted centuries longer than the Atlantic slave trade in favor of continuously shaming white people. I want to know why. Why white people are continuously on the receiving end of spite and hatred despite other races doing the same thing. One of my friends who is black and always gives me shit for being white didn't even know about the Arab slave trade until I told her about it. Also, you've exhibited whataboutism a few times over the course of our dialogue so in your hostile words, ""sit the fuck down"". 

I do feel bad for you because you clearly don't want equality from what i've gathered during this conversation. You said it yourself: ""fucking up everyone that doesn't look like them for centuries should earn them only this and nothing else"".

You don't want equality. You want a power shift. You want white people to feel shame, guilt and be punished and POC to have power over them. You can point fingers at me and call me racist (because that's the easy thing to do), deflect, say i'm ignorant, that my input doesn't matter because of my skin colour, etc etc... But look in the mirror and figure out exactly what kind of future you think would be peaceful/equal and whether the current approach is working towards that.

Easy - Discourse. Discussions like the one we're having now that other people will read and form opinions on. Saying things like ""white peoples opinions don't matter"" isn't exactly going to be effective in combating racism or generating meaningful thought provoking discussion. 

At the end of the day my opinion stands. I think that word does nothing but breed toxicity and anger. It has too much spite behind it towards a group of people (used to be spite towards blacks, now spite towards whites) to really be a term of true endearment. It still has the same power today as it did when it was created and I think that's a true shame since it undoubtedly contributes to racial tensions. Finally ridding of a word like that, or allowing context in popular usage to reduce the racial tension involved with it is a good step towards combating racism in America. 

Holding it up to such a standard like not letting white people say it, even in the context of song lyrics, is just setting the precedent for when a white person will inevitably say it (like Hannah on video), which then leads to tons of toxicity. Can't support that."

> why do white people enjoy saying a word that historically associated with literal commodification of another race?

Because in music it's not used in that context by the artist. Black people reclaimed the word and changed its meaning and non-POC who say it while singing that song are using it in that context.

> why should they even get an opinion when systemic racism is still the norm?

Because they're a group of people heavily involved in that topic and everyone has opinions. You can disagree with it, or ignore it. But it's not going to stop white people from *having* opinions. Not to mention white people are heavily involved in many matters of race so they do have a say. 

> seriously stop trying to act like this discourse hasn't happened when so many people have weighed on this years ago. it has happened, 

Why are you acting like it's happened and it's done, the book is closed? So long as the word exists and is popularized, discourse WILL be happening since the n-word is very very relevant. White people gave it that power and black people continue to give it power. If it's relevant and controversial, discussion will always happen. Period.

Because like I said, so long as it continues to be perpetuated in popular media and ingrained as a slang term and is relevant, then discourse is not going to stop.

Because it's popular in media and relevant.

Regardless, again, you're missing what i'm saying. I never said I wanted the n-word to be acceptable to say among white people in music because ""I want to say it"". I never had that opinion.  

My point this whole time has been that the n-word has gone from a reclaimed term, to being popularized in any and every form of media that all races of people consume. As *idealistic* as it is to expect non-black people to not say the n-word, it's not *realistic*. We see that time and time again. Like someone else said go on Tik Tok and there's PAGES of videos of white people lip syncing and not censoring the n-word. It's not rare for non-black people to be singing along and not censoring the n-word. 

The word holds as much power as we give to it. And given that it will continue to constantly be a controversial word and non-black people will be lip syncing to it or singing it as long as black artists continue using it frequently in music and popular media, it might be best to consider introducing context and intent for said non-black people since almost all of them mean no harm and making a huge issue out of someone non-black singing a harmless lyric containing that word, might not be the healthiest reaction. 

Like you said, this issue has been a thing for over 40 years now. It's not going anywhere so long as we continue to give so much power to it. Otherwise we're just spinning our wheels and expecting a different result."

See this is the problem. This narrative that there's absolutely no room for discussion since it's not our place to have any discussion or opinions or to make any conjectures.

Because i'm referring to the era of exponential technological uprising and global reach. Streaming, media, etc etc... It spreads to every community on every corner of the earth.

> it's not our word to use because we fucked it up for centuries.

Who's 'we'? Because, not so shockingly, not all white people have ties to extreme racism and slavery - myself included. So it's also not right to basically prohibit everyone else from not saying the word simply by appearance of people who were evil and did. Hence the time for a new conversation.

> It's selfish to ask them to change how they feel about a term literally used to reduce humans to products just so you feel better about singing to a song.

Sure. But like I said, it's not changing. Non-POC will be saying the n-word so long as it's popularized as much as it is in the media. I'm just the messenger here. I'm also not asking or telling black people to have this conversation... Merely suggesting it since it'll give them more peace of mind instead of always being upset when situations like this inevitably occur. 

> Why say that we should allow a historically racist term to continue, instead of saying maybe curriculums should engage with the term and its current reclamation? Why allow people a pass instead of expecting them to learn? Do you really not see who this benefits and who this hurts?

Because IMO, context and intent should be a factor for non-POC too. In the black community it's simultaneously a term of endearment and a term of vitriol depending on how it's used. It's taught to them early on that ""anytime white people say it even in music it's bad"", so you're basically setting the community up for failure since inevitably, given the reach of media and its popularization, non-POC people will be saying it and this will always generate negativity and anger. So it's a vicious cycle. 

Like, people know alcohol is bad for you and can lead to dependence and health issues... But yet a majority of people still drink knowing this. 

We get into cars daily knowing they pollute the environment and can get into accidents and get injured because they're efficient for getting around and are fun to drive.

Many people still eat meat knowing it's at the expense of a suffering animal and is destroying the planet, but it's tasty and available. 

Much in the same way, yes non-POC are aware the n-word has bad history, but when it's used in songs they love many are still going to say it since music and media is universal and accessible to all and there's no consequences for saying it, except maybe shame and physical violence. But that's a risk like anything most people take. 

Yes we can acknowledge the horrid history surrounding the word and it's reclamation. But maybe it's time for another conversation since the word isn't going anywhere for anyone. If you popularize it to be a term of endearment regardless of history, don't be surprised to see some people saying it who you don't want to be saying it."

The problem with this is as the N-word keeps getting popularized more and more in mainstream and popular media all races consume and normalized to the point of being a slang term, it's not realistic to expect every single white person/non-black person to not say it and we'll just end up seeing more and more situations like the Hannah one currently. It WILL keep happening. All the time. You can't have your cake and eat it too. The more you normalize and popularize it, the less you'll be able to police it. We're seeing that more and more. 

So there needs to be a serious conversation amongst black people and non-black people on context and intent since the word is here to stay in mainstream media. If someone non-black is singing a song, it's pretty clear they're simply reciting lyrics and not intending malice or harm. So is it worth the energy and outrage to drag and cancel them?

So the best resolution is to accept that since the word is used so commonly as slang and popularized in songs, many white people are going to say it when they're singing and they are NOT intending malice or harm.

canada,fqt2dcp,t1_fqpc2aj,1589627612.0,"> I don't think people are unaware that we are talking shit. And it's not really talking shit if we are correct.

Nah, it's still talking shit because there's always spite towards them involved. And most times Canadians are being hypocritical when slinging said shit at the USA. We have more in common with the USA than differences. A LOT more. An 'opinion' doesn't make it correct. Are Americans incorrect when they say the USA does some things better than Canada? You would probably say yes because your pride of thinking we're so much more amazing than them gets in the way. But doesn't make it true. 

> We still are polite, we aren't killing joggers or standing out with automatic guns shoulder to shoulder screaming to open up the economy after spending all our money on ammunition.

LMFAO this is hilarious. Literally cherry picking news stories and resorting to hyperbole to paint a narrative. Am I shocked? Nope. You sound like a typical angsty ""I hAtE aMeRiCaNs"" Canadian. FYI, we just had a mass shooting here a month ago and murders happen in big cities often. Not sure if you saw the news.

> For your recall, I never said canada did a good job or a bad job...

But you implied we were doing a better job in response to this than the USA. Which I don't agree with.

> you're the one who's making a competition... Which is why I responded to it...

Nope, I was dismissing Canadians who are constantly foaming at the mouth to spitefully dismiss the USA as worse than us. Aka, Canadians who are making shit a competition. I don't think there is a competition myself - I think both our countries do things great (and some things not so great) and I think the USA is an awesome country and we'd be nothing without them and i'm grateful for them as an ally. So I take umbrage when I see Canadians trying to gloat about how much 'better' we are and how much they suck. It's all just an inferiority complex. 

I actually, for one, appreciate them and don't grasp at any opportunity I can to be all ""aMeRiCa sUcKsssssss!!!!"" since I appreciate the quality of life we have here due to their contribution to our country, economy and way of life.

> Ok so just because I acknowledge that America is worse means I'm bad?

No... I didn't say that. You're entitled to that opinion. I said that using *your* experiences to speak on behalf of everyone isn't a good argument. For all I know, you could have made most of that stuff up for arguments sake. That's why anecdotal stories aren't reliable or sufficient in arguments. They don't hold up and aren't provable nor do they speak to everyone's experiences. 

> Like what the fuck are you trying to prove exactly? Do you think Canada should start killing joggers? Do you think Canada should start arresting families when they are social distancing in parks? Do you think the canadian government should give money to the Raptors and also make it impossible to get stimulus packages to people who have back taxes but then also tell them they will be arrested if they try to work? Do you think we should have armed protests where people do not social distance with automatic guns present?

""Look! Let me grab some headlines from the biggest news stories out of one of the most powerful countries on earth and use it to dismiss the entire country and their people!"" 

We just had a mass shooting.

Police officers arrested and jailed a woman in Alberta for promoting a business in a Star Wars costume because she was holding a plastic laser gun.

We have 'reopen the economy' protests here too.

I could go on and on. Just because we're not in the news as often as the USA doesn't mean shit doesn't happen here. And FYI 'America' doesn't kill joggers. 2 racist *Americans* did. Just like 1 insane Canadian killed over 20 people. Or racist Canadians assaulting Asians over coronavirus.

> Why don't you move to Michigan? Seems like you belong.

Lol yup, you are a classic Canadian. ""Why don't you just leave if you don't like it here!!"". You don't think I would if I could? My longterm plan is to end up in California. But a little thing called ""visas"" and ""immigration laws"" prevent me from packing up and leaving since, you know, the USA is another country. So fuck off with that you know it's not that simple."

My point still remains. Canadians legit foam at the mouth at any opportunity to shit on the USA. The inferiority complex is rampant big time here. 

> And all of canada did not shit the bed...

Yes, we did. We didn't cease air travel to China and Europe until *after* the USA did, which would explain why we have almost as many COVID-19 cases as China has reported and are the 14th most infected country (per the actual reported numbers. We're not even testing as much as the USA or other countries are so i'm sure it's much higher) and we didn't implement mandatory quarantine for new arrivals until we were neck deep in COVID infections. We definitely didn't handle things well at all. 

0.2% of Canada's population is infected.
0.4% of the USA's population is infected. 

We're not that far off daddy USA's stats once you account for population. Again, it's probably closer since the USA is testing anyone and everyone whereas Canada in some places is still only testing seniors, people who were in contact with people positive for COVID-19 and indigenous peoples."
