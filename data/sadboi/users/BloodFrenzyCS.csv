Stims,fq6itq1,t1_fq5acoq,1589132356.0,No one can tell you the exact damage. It's probably not very significant when compared to meth doses. 60mg in any single dose at a time. So 60mg in the morning and maybe 20mg in the evening might be okay.

Antipsychiatry,fq23os3,t1_fq1wdo7,1589052548.0,It depends on you and what symptoms you're currently experiencing. If you're not hallucinating or having other issues right now and are taking the recommended dosage of medication you can wait. You might need to take medication for the rest of your life if you have schizophrenia to live normally. And that's okay. It could also be temporary psychosis and you might be fine off meds. Only time will tell.

Antipsychiatry,fq1lm2x,t3_ge45u3,1589046736.0,It doesn't go lower than .5mg as prescribed. So you can come directly off of .5mg. But it's up to you honestly. Withdrawl symptoms are hard to predict. So if you wanted you can do .25mg for two weeks and then come off of it directly.

Psychosis,fkp5uyu,t1_fkp5fuy,1584402481.0,Holy crap. I've heard antipsychotic and weed don't mix well at all. Except for aripripizole. That's the only one recommended for chronic users that refuse to stop smoking and it shouldn't cause psychosis while smoking.
schizophrenia,fkoqwmh,t3_fjlqd0,1584393136.0,"Boredom can do that. You'd rather shock yourself routinely rather than sit patiently. And APs can partially cause that because they block dopamine receptors. I say find a happy medium. You don't have to be on meds 24/7 but once psychosis hits, you need to take meds. Psychosis is often a sign of brain inflammation and sometimes damage. No one can tell you how bad or how much damage each successive episode causes. But we know it's ultimately bad to have more rather than less for your brain. Find other activities to occupy yourself with. It can be anything. Check /r/hobbies"
MakeNewFriendsHere,fkomy7e,t1_fkoexz2,1584390449.0,What do you think is the cause of this? There are specific subreddits for things like sex friends. So why waste time and energy on a subreddit where the focus isn't what they want? Surely these men don't actually accomplish anything.
