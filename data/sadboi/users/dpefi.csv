From becoming friends with other gay men though, I've learned that it's pretty common with the community in general. Cis gay men can struggle with this a lot too - ones that came out later in life, especially. Something that helped me feel more confident in my identity as a gay man was reminding myself that there are really only two things you need to *truly* be a part of the gay (man) community: to be guy and to be into other guys! I didn't really find more than one close gay guy friend, but I found that time helped my confidence/comfort in the community immensely.

I used to read through transphobia on these subs frequently. And as a mod, I have to deal with some uglier transphobic posts to make sure they don't get onto our sub. Both of those things had me terrified when I first started publicly dating as a gay man.

My experience actually dating IRL has been... so nice? I've never met any guy that's turned me down for being trans. I keep waiting for it to happen, but it hasn't. Every guy I've hooked up with or dated in the past year or so has been 100% gay and also coincidentally cisgender (although I have hooked up with trans guys in the past/this is just relevant because I worry about transphobia from cis gay guys). It's been incredibly and surprisingly validating. My current boyfriend and I have been dating for almost six months now. I could just be getting lucky, but from what I've read from other trans guys - even though it's a mixed bag - it's never going to be as bad as those transphobes want you to think."

gaytransguys,fhfpn10,t3_f2g0jm,1581548408.0,"Like someone else said below, I would like to say that making a choice to transition based on the opinions of other people is generally never a good thing. I think the opinions of potential dating partners counts here.

I understand the fear. Transphobia is a real thing, and there are people that won't date you because you're trans whether their reasoning is transphobic or not. There's no denying that.

But I like to think that I wouldn't date a transphobe even if I was cisgender. And I see people who aren't open to dating trans people for other reasons like people that don't like me for something that's kind of just a thing I was dealt with and can't control. It's like if I had red hair. I'm not going to dye it blonde to make people who don't like redheads want to date me. And staying in the closet is way worse than just having to metaphorically dye your hair! Lastly, personally, I was never really comfortable dating while I was 'not trans'/'cis' anyways. Even in a relationship that was perfect in other aspects, there was always a distance between who I actually was and who my partner saw me as. I still felt pretty alone. It's a different kind of alone.

I started dating my boyfriend four months ago. He's cis, gay, and was honestly a little nervous about me being trans when we first started talking since it was a new thing for him. I was too. I'd never dated a cis guy before.

We said I love you to each other for the first time yesterday. The last and first time someone said that to me was three years ago, when I was in the closet and 'cis' and genuinely in a lot of denial. I did love the person I was dating. But I wasn't comfortable enough in my own skin to really be able to *love-love* them. I said it back out of obligation.

This time? It killed me. I've never been happier. I don't know how long this is going to last, and I'm sure there'll be times where I feel alone afterwards, but I think choosing to transition means giving up a chance at a not-entirely-fulfilling-or-honest-relationship for one that really, really makes you feel something. With someone who knows who you really are entirely and loves you for it. You deserve that.

And I think it's worth the risk."

In high school, I was too depressed to really think about my identity in any kind of way like that (cue was-dysphoria-a-part-of-that questioning); I was also kind of transphobic because of ideas my parents and friends had. I knew I was queer in some way but had no clear idea of how or why, so I kept that out of my head.

I met a lot of awesome people my freshman year of college and got over my internalized transphobia and homophobia. I came out as bisexual and figured I was done. Then the summer after freshman year, I shamefully admitted to a friend that I 'wasn't completely comfortable with my gender'. As soon as I did that and let myself say it, thinking about it got really intense. I started having a hard time not being aware of it. I cut my hair, tried things out, starting saying that any pronouns were fine in secret hopes that people would use he/him and not they/them. I went in between trying things out that made me feel good and then dealing with the guilt that came with that and dread about accepting that they did. It was exhausting, and I considered taking a semester off.

I had the official realization moment my sophomore year of college, when I was 19, then spent a few more months in some more pretty unhealthy denial. 

I came out right before I turned 20 that same year.

I also struggled with the fact that I didn't know that I was trans my whole life. I worried that it was a phase or temporary, and it took me a long time to accept that how I was feeling was real. But I just turned 21, have been on T for a year, and I've never been happier or felt more present or real."

The hard fact is that you're going to meet people where being trans is a deal breaker; I usually find that they are usually nice about it, and them being dicks about it is rarer. It can be rough. 

But the fact that goes along with it is that there are people who will hear that you're trans and take it in stride. They might have experience with trans people already. They might just know and be cool with it without making it a big deal, like that guy did in kind of non-bad-intentioned (hopefully) way.

**Stay hopeful, take care of yourself first,** and remember that dating is rough for everyone in different kinds of ways.

I think you'll find it's pretty common for guys on here to share their insecurities about their identity. As if being trans wasn't hard enough, a lot of us have to worry about what constitutes being gay enough; the gay community is really phallocentric and transphobia exists in a lot of places you would really think it wouldn't exist.

I still struggle with feeling secure in my identity. But I do find comfort in stating the two facts that make me a gay man. Which are:

I am a man.

I am into men.

Therefore, logically, I am a gay man. The first one really gives me more trouble than any, if I'm being honest. I personally don't doubt my attraction to guys. It also helps to remember that fitting into the gay community is something that a lot of cis gay guys struggle with too; we have a lot of assumptions about what that means, but at the end of the day all you need to be a gay man is to be a man who's attracted to guys.

I'm not super sure what to say to help with most of your fears/doubts, but I just wanted to say that I feel a lot of what you said. Especially when I first realized that I was a gay trans guy. It gets easier. And harder, sometimes, but overall I think all we can ask for is a slow upward slope of happiness/comfort, right?

traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,ewzxpi7,t1_ewzusm5,1565902181.0,OP is valid in not wanting to have a noticeable chest since it causes them dysphoria. Different experiences. Please respect that.
gaytransguys,ewzwdfv,t3_cqusxs,1565901626.0,welcome back!!
gaytransguys,ewzw7b6,t3_cqvd55,1565901557.0,welcome gaylord
ftm,ewyp2y0,t3_cqpiib,1565884669.0,">Basically, I'm gay and also a transsexual, because God knew that only making me one alone would not be enough to hold me down from taking his place.

I... love this so much, I'm definitely going to steal this if that's okay with you.

I don't think you're weird. I'm also a gay trans guy (check out r/gaytransguys if you have not already) (the mods are pretty cool) (I am a mod), and PIV makes me feel a good amount of dysphoric. It's fun, but it feels like kind of a reminder that I don't have the parts I would *prefer* to have had. I know it's cool for some gay trans guys though - to each their own! I think it's hard to tell what's more common or not since it seems like we're all scattered, but emphasis on the 'to each their own' thing."
asktransgender,ewuzr38,t3_cq5vkp,1565795437.0,"It's the word 'fool' - it implies that being trans/transitioning is someone trying to trick people, to make them think that they're something that they're not. It's not a slightly edgy meme; it's a pretty blatantly transphobic joke. I hope your friend is willing to listen, and, if not, I kind of agree with the other people who commented saying you should drop her."
gaytransguys,ewpp1in,t3_cpisrd,1565646039.0,Love the nose ring!!
gaytransguys,ewpn1ds,t3_coltbk,1565644748.0,"I just looked up that tweet to check it out, and, despite the rest of it/that passive-aggressive comment about post-op stuff, seeing him recognize that ""\[gay trans guys\]... go back over 100 years"" does feel really validating. Things will get better friend."
gaytransguys,ewpmiek,t3_coqk16,1565644408.0,I'm sorry life is being shitty right now. But I definitely feel this; I've been listening to Brendon Urie for years hahaha
gaytransguys,ewpmfae,t3_cp2t4m,1565644353.0,great minds think alike!
gaytransguys,ewpmdkw,t3_cp882d,1565644322.0,"this is so cute and sweet, thank you for sharing :')"
gaytransguys,ewgeoc3,t1_ewg5gg5,1565380154.0,they all look pretty cool... catch me changing my flair color daily
gaytransguys,ewgemsh,t1_ewg1lgn,1565380128.0,"That is a *list* of accomplished stuff, nice! Hope you have a good weekend too. :)"
gaytransguys,ewgej09,t1_ewgdvtb,1565380062.0,That's so awesome!!!

gaytransguys,ewg2hsv,t1_ewc4rk6,1565372451.0,"There was one point this year where three gay guys I knew, all friends, all bleached their hair in succession (like week after week), and it was hilarious. They didn't plan it like that, but it just happened. I think one of them dyed it something else pretty quick because it was too weird."
gaytransguys,ewg2c90,t1_ewa1td7,1565372357.0,Definitely. I don't think OP was trying to say that there's one 'way' (especially not one right way) to look gay.
gaytransguys,ewfzvq7,t3_co5ci0,1565370836.0,"I know I could use some positivity. The week has been hard, but I flirted with this really cute guy who said I was 'pretty like a renaissance boy'. He lives in another state/we only know each other online so nothing will happen, but it was a cool ego booster."
GenderCynical,ewftiqv,t1_ewfq0mn,1565367241.0,And you know if they responded with anything else/in any kind of way she would use it for exactly the same point. I'm shocked honestly; how can you post this and see yourself as the good guy in this story lmao?
GenderCynical,ewft7ed,t3_cnpo8y,1565367092.0,Global! Warming! Is! Trans!
GenderCynical,ewaa9wh,t3_cn6hmh,1565239549.0,"I'm sorry, but the end kills me.

I think of the *Phantom of of the Opera* and heard  'Scream with me, sisters' as the sung part where he's like 'Sing for me, angel', and I'm cracking myself up."
gaytransguys,ew8dd17,t3_cn9ldo,1565207880.0,"Congrats on top surgery! 
I bleached my hair last month, and honestly I felt like half of the gay men that I know lol. I think dying your hair (mine is now brown instead of my natural black) and experimenting with jewelry (I tried simple silver rings and necklaces) are both good, non-permanent ways to change up your look to seem more visibly queer/gay. I like that both of those things kind of just fit to the style I had already, which is really more ‘traditionally masculine’ leaning than anything."
