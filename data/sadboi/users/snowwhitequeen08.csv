Don't be an ass and demand she take it down. People fear what they don't know, but ffs, educate yourself. You will destroy her trust if you continue on the path you're on."

AskReddit,fh1swsa,t3_f0yf2a,1581223233.0,"I would have thought.... there would be no chance someone as handsome and outgoing as he is, or as muscular, would fall for the quiet bookworm like me.

He loves sports. I've never been big into them.

He broke the rules and had fun. I was a goody two-shoes and preferred to stay in.

He was/is a social butterfly when going out. I'm more of a people watcher.

He didn't go to college and is a successful business owner. I'm a college graduate not working in my field of choice (which, by the way, what the shit?)

And yet, here we are, coming up on 8 years together this summer. Had he never jumped over the divider at the bar and introduced himself even as i was shy and thinking ""there is no way this guy is hitting on me"", I wouldn't have two amazing step kiddos, nor would I have our two kids. I wouldn't have our home or our car. I wouldn't have our home. I would never have watched him play baseball and been so damn proud watching him catch, or have my heart melt as he talks with the kids (or sharing that sly smile together over the kids heads).

He randomly starts singing around the house and dances like a dork, and I just can't imagine how my life would be without him. Everything about him. I might have called someone crazy had they said ""this is your future fiance/husband"" because he was way out of my league, but i wouldn't change a thing about our chance meeting or any of the fights, surprises, and genuinely amazing and happy moments we've been able to share."

StopSelfHarm,f53xai7,t3_dm9u2g,1571965847.0,"Rats can take a bit to warm up to you, give them a bit of time (had many over the years). I recommend handing them treats from your own hand (apples, grapes, they love yogurt, etc.), and also putting an old shirt or something that smells like you so they can get used to your smell. They will start coming around, you've got this. Oh, they also looooooove goats milk.

I am sorry you feel so alone, for what it's worth, it's okay to feel that sometimes. Try to write it out, word vomit all over a page for your eyes only (keep it, burn it, whatever feels right to you!). Find a creative outlet if you can, listen to music, go sit in a park and listen to the wind in the trees and animals around you. You matter, even if it doesn't feel like it right now. Draw on your skin if you need to, but don't pick up those blades. I believe in you."

AskReddit,epml4nx,t3_buz6lq,1559314438.0,"He had all my teen years, and I was young and dumb, very first relationship (15 - 20). He was jealous all the time, started getting me isolated, told me my college education was stupid (as he stayed home and played video games all day), would get mad when I started working, and tried knocking me up (because a baby would make me stay, apparently).

Came to a head the last year of our relations. Living hell, we saw eachother once a week, I'd spend the night and sex became making me cry, leaving me in a pitch black room, then him having his way with me (rinse and repeat in the morning). Was looking over my bank statements and realized I had spent $4000 over a 6 month period on video games and anything else he had wanted, then when I cut my hair (didn't even tell him I had dyed it), he flipped shit and told me I was going to go fuck other guys. Something finally snapped in me and I was done. I still have PTSD from what occurred, and he has tried repeatedly to contact me over the years because ""I miss my friend/you knew me best"".

Unfortunately I jumped from one crazy to another crazy after that. Dude was super clingy, would never leave me alone, another no job and had a curfew from his mom and dad to be home at 10 PM (at age 25). Then when he broke up with me, had the audacity to tell me later ""you were supposed to say no"". This ain't a Hollywood movie, cupcake. 

Hindsight is 20/20."
