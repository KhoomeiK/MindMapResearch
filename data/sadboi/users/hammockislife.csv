MBA,fmq4fyo,t3_fwrdv7,1586292686.0,"From what I know INSEAD has great recruiting at MBB in Europe.

Your MBA is what you make of it. We talk a lot about admissions and it's great getting into a dream school, but it's not over once you are accepted: it actually just started. So if you want to party for the duration of the degree, so be it. If you want to study hard and launch a company or whatever, put yourself to it. Take the opportunity to build the network, take what the school has to offer and move on with your life.

A school like INSEAD doesn't get the brand recognition they did by being bad. The school definitely has loads to offer, otherwise they wouldn't be what they are.

The COVID-19 situation is something to think about, but if you feel you're in a ""now or never"" situation I would recommend picking ""now"", since you said INSEAD is your dream school.

You're in a stage of your life in which you have beaten the obstacles that keep most people from succeeding (I take that from you saying that you work in a BB making 100k+). Therefore, if you go to INSEAD and work/study hard, it will pay off."

Coffee,fk4566b,t1_fk4317o,1583853530.0,"I'm so glad you reached out. How many coffee shops do you want to see?

These are my favorites:

Café do Moço, in the Juvevê neighborhood. This guy, Leo Moço, won the national barista championships 4 times, and he also roasts amazing coffee. I recommend you try the Cocoa Sprouting on the Chemex. You can sit at the bar and talk to the barista brewing your coffee and he will explain the fermentation the coffee beans go through before roasting. This specific process was developed by Leo Moço himself.

Lucca Specialty Coffee in the Batel region. This is where Brazil's first ""coffee hunter"" roasts and sells. It's an amazing coffee shop and they also bake incredible bread. The owner of this place pretty much introduced Nordic roasts to the Brazilian scene.

There's also a new coffee shop called ""Cuppa Coffee"" near the Oscar Niemeyer Museum. I haven't been there yet but I only heard amazing things about them. They only sell coffee *not* roasted in Curitiba, as the specialty coffee culture here has been growing quite a bit and they were a bit tired of seeing the same roasters all over the city.

And, to top it off, on Saturdays there is a farmers market in the Juvevê neighborhood. About a block from the market you can visit the Moka Clube roastery. These guys are super friendly (if you go there, ask for Carlos. He's a great friend of mine and he can give you a full tour of the place), and they hold free coffee tastings every Saturday. They often partner with other companies that produce cheese, drinks or desserts for the Saturday events. If you're lucky, you might catch a coffee + cheese pairing while you're there.

If you need any more recommendations, let me know."

what i'm talking about is not a matter of being sensitive to the drug itself, but to your feelings. sometimes i take a long time to define and understand what i'm feeling. sometimes i can perceive changes faster. your mileage may vary.

anyway, 1 month is not a milestone in which everybody will see change or improvement. it can take longer. don't worry if it didn't click already. it won't be a groundbreaking change overnight, but you will slowly notice you feel better, with more energy, and more willing to get up and do stuff."
