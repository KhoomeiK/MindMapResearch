depression,f7np7aj,t3_dx2la6,1573912378.0,"Other than the short memory lost, which is so common to me that I just accept it, my ability to pay attention to anything decreases severely. I just cannot focus on one thing, tho my family and friends just call it ""Multitasking."" I haven't been able to finish watching a TV show or just a movie in a long time. I have to pause and do something else when reading. All these make me feel more slack behind and sad because I am definitely malfuntioning.  Also, my wording and logic tend to go off, which lead me deeper into this negative loop because I feel like everyone listen to me talk finds it weird. I literally can't stop thinking about how everyone thinks I am weird and hates me."
