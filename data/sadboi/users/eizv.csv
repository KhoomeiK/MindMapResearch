BPD,f6y4yg5,t3_dspuar,1573267801.0,">Is this worth being sad about? Is it worth talking about?

During my internship at a hospital about a month ago, I made quite a few friends with people there. I'm not too comfortable around strangers, if I'm being honest but I tried to get along with them as possible because I was afraid I might fuck things up if I keep isolating myself since I'm new around the place.

During the first week, a male colleague got too comfortable and thought it's ok to get into my space and went physical with me. It wasn't anything serious, he tapped me on the shoulder while I was talking to other people and I just froze there not knowing what to do, or say, or act. 

Later I addressed this issues and he apologized about it, but of course being the dumbass he was, he called me into his room which literally was all male room and I sat there, trying to act as cool as possible despite the fact that I was panicking. My mind was a chaos. I felt like it's my fault.

""If I don't speak to anyone about him maybe he wouldn't have call me in like this."" 

(On another note: I felt threaten, being the only female in the room so I apologized to him for the misunderstanding, even though I clearly knew it's not my fault.) 

He literally stop talking to me after the meeting, which was good, I was relieved but at the same time I felt like I did wrong and need to apologize to him for addressing the issue the other day.

I kept asking myself if I was being too sensitive, if I was overreacting. This literally went on for weeks. I couldn't stop mentioning it to my bf and friends that I kept apologizing to them for talking about the same things for weeks. I couldn't stop because it keeps bugging me. I felt like everything happened was my fault and constantly need them to tell me it wasn't. It's not normal. I know but I couldn't help it. :("
