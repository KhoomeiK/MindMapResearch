Eve,flmrywd,t1_flmris7,1585294169.0,"to reply a little better, most sigs i mine in are at least 10au from a gate, which means you've got about 10 seconds before even the fastest, luckiest pilot can get to you (drams and garmurs are scary). you have time to warp off. porpoises really are amazing and you don't need an orca til you have 12+ covs on field. rorqs are only used if you have a standing fleet to help or you like losing rorqs.

nullsec carebear intel channels means that you are almost never surprised by roamers which leaves wormholers suddenly arriving as your main threat. most of these that I have encountered are much better than me in all regards and I have been caught, but really they can only tackle one or two and they aren't jumping 150 men into a porpoise and 10 cov, they are looking for rorqs. they also have to warp to where ever you are, WHs seem to sense where you are magically so they came right for you, but they still have warp time."
