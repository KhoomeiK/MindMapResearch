IAmA,fqn03hl,t3_gjosrb,1589486411.0," Hello  Dr., I've been diagnosed with severe depression and have not been able  to have a good relaxing sleep in the last 3 years, although the meds  have somehow helped in getting some sleep at night and be more proactive  during the day I don't feel relaxed at all and after having an okay  night schedule for a few days, the cycle repeats and i can't find myself  to sleep at night, can you give me some tips to maintain my sleeping  schedule?

It'll be really great, thanks."

depression,fg8v7pn,t3_ex7om6,1580630145.0,"Hey, I used to feel and still sometimes feel mentally and physically fatigued throughout the day, even after having 18 hours of sleep, i used to wake up without any rest. It can be incredibly exhausting, although pushing through it maybe a common advise, i would say to take deep breaths and avoid thinking about what you are gonna do next, cause it generally leads to more fatigue for me. I really hope you have got yourself diagnosed and are feeling much better now because no one deserves this."
CasualConversation,fbvlyx0,t3_eejv7d,1577132731.0,"Hey, I'm not sure if anyone will see this comment but i just wanted to say it out, i've been diagnosed with severe depression and i'm suffering from it for at least the past 3 years and just got diagnosed in the start of 2019, i started the medications just a week before my exams and i failed a couple of my exams in my final semester, now when i went to see the doctor the first time i was just barely holding on, but now when i think of it i never really failed any of my exams in any semester so far until i started taking the meds, so i sometimes regret my decision of getting diagnosed before the exams, i'm not sure if i made the right decision.

 To be honest i feel nobody wants to be friends with a depressed person, not only it makes you lose the friends you already had, depression alters your personality so significantly that you just not only avoid people but it feels like people avoid you too, even if i miss my meds for a day i become miserable again. I can't feel any kind of emotions and it really fucked up my mind but meds seem to make me relax and not have negative thinking but it's still not getting any better, it just feels like it helps me to cope with it but not really able to get rid of it. I just fail like a failure to be honest."
depression,f0wscfn,t3_d6oo6o,1569013093.0,"Hey, I think why you don't act on this sudden suicide impulse you get is because you still have hope, meaning you still believe that it's possible that the dark time you're going through will pass and you'll be happy again, hope is a very important thing to have, when one loses it he acts on his impulse, and I request you to not give up that light of hope within you and please visit a therapist if you've not already, and please pm if you want to talk about it because you're not alone. :)"
depression,f0wrlhn,t3_d6zo4v,1569012692.0,"Hello, I very much understand what you're going through as I'm going through it myself (the emptiness, the suicidal thoughts, unable to feel any emotions etc.)
your mind keeps on running and running and your head feels like it's locked in a dark, damp room which it cannot escape and these bad thoughts keep coming in your head and you want to stop thinking but you can't no matter what you do, you feel like things will never be the same they used to be before (when you were not depressed), but believe me the situation isn't completely hopeless, 
I am not going to say stop having suicidal thoughts or thinking like this/that, but I do request you to not act on the sudden suicide impulse you've (it comes in waves), please seek help of a therapist and take the meds prescribed, they do help (even if a little bit) and please send out a pm to me if you feel like the need to talk. :) cause it can get lonely out there."
depression,f0wo6ro,t3_d6v0nl,1569010885.0,"Hey, what i believe is that depression does not really make you toxic person but it does make you push away people whom you love and care about, as you see yourself as a burden on them so you try your best to make them not love you (idk if it makes sense) by trying to push them away from your life, it also happens when you feel that the people who are supposed to provide you with the love and support you need (like your parents and your bf) are not providing it or are unable to provide, for that you've to understand that people who don't suffer from depression or have never encountered it will not likely understand what you're going through, for that please i'll suggest you to visit a good psychiatrist /psychologist who can talk to you and your parents as well so they can understand what you're going through and be understanding of your condition.

If you want to talk about it, please pm :)"
depression,f0wmn6g,t3_d6r3hi,1569010074.0,"Hey I'm not sure if this will help you or not, but i used to feel the same way all the time for 3 continuous years but after i got myself diagnosed and been taking the medicine prescribed for 4-5 months now it has helped me a bit, at least it has given me the energy to make some of the basic life decisions and take control of my life, now i can sleep at night for the most of the time (12-18 hour sleep cycle is still an issue), it's like you can see the light at the end of the tunnel but that opening is still too far away but you can work on it, take step-by-step towards getting better, first of all you've to go get yourself diagnosed and take your prescribed medicine, and it's a slow process, changes happen very slowly but they'll happen (even if a little bit), If you want to talk about what you're going through, please send out a text."
