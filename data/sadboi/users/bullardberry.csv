Mindfulness,fqxjs4d,t1_fqxh6xs,1589733390.0,"I have been struggling with this too, and my strategy has been to also label it when I am
noticing judgement. In the same way that I try to note “thinking...thinking” when I catch myself in thought, I sometimes take it farther if I catch myself thinking about the thinking or judging about the thinking and try to note that as well then go back to my breath."

EDIT: Hold on, its bravissimo isn’t it? I just read that as an exclamation at first! Never mind I’ll see myself out."
EatingDisorders,fqs2ajv,t3_gkck21,1589596915.0,"One of the worst things about eating disorders is that they convince you that you don’t deserve help. I promise you do. Reach out to a professional, just to chat."
dogswithjobs,foo360m,t1_fomkc52,1587931592.0,I once got to ride the light rail with about 15 service pups in training and it was the best moment of my life. I played it cool so they could focus on their jobs but inside I was screaming.

MtvChallenge,fo0qtj8,t3_g4yrcb,1587418060.0,Anybody else think Jay looks like Val from the 1998 Disney classic “Brink!”? Because I can very easily picture him covered in chocolate milkshake.
AmItheAsshole,fntch84,t3_g3nzye,1587238899.0,Holy shit her body does not belong to you YTA YTA YTA. Hope she tells you the scars healed and look great and then immediately ends it.
AmItheAsshole,fnt8aqz,t3_g3mt16,1587236545.0,"Congrats you totally ruined one of the small things that brought her joy and she’ll never again be able to love it the way she used to without thinking about the time that you acted like she was flawed, wrong, and unattractive because she likes to drink out of jars. 

YTA."
Psychonaut,fnsieug,t1_fnsbaqv,1587222268.0,Someone needs to call the police on this person and not just talk about the awful shit he does. If you and your friends have evidence of child pornography you can’t keep that to yourself.

EatingDisorders,f58hdxt,t3_dmhkpq,1572056216.0,"I feel exactly the same. I constantly think I’m not “sick enough”, or that if I tell people about my ED they won’t believe me. I’m still in the early stages of therapy, and it feels like many sessions this comes up and I am asking for validation that I deserve help and for her to reassure me that I do gave an ED. 
I wish I knew what more to say other than you are not alone."
