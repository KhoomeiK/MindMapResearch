I have what is called ""C-PTSD"" (Complex PTSD). It is developed after repeated or chronic trauma (like an abusive relationship) as opposed to a single event like a car crash or a death. 

The episodes and flash backs are the same, and it is neither more severe nor less severe than PTSD. It is different in your reactions to the trauma memories. Trauma is real, and we're not taking it seriously enough.

HobbyDrama,fc5s3qt,t3_coeqeu,1577464632.0,"I'm obsessed with the Hunchback of Notre Dame stage musical. It's the perfect blend between the cartoon and the book, and it gives Frollo so much more dimension. He's more sympathetic....to a degree. His back story provides a lot more context rather than introducing him as a horrific bigot right off the bat. You understand WHY he's a horrific bigot, and you get a little more insight into why his obsession with Esmeralda is uniquely horrific outside of just lust. There is a scene where she is in the prison before her execution, and he comes in to offer her his deal one more time: give yourself to me exclusively, I'll work to convert you and save your soul. She calls him a monster, and he says, if anything, she has shown him that he is incredibly HUMAN, and that is what he has feared--being on the same level as sinners as opposed to someone more pious.

When she initially enters the Cathedral (""God Help the Outcasts""), he actually speaks to her about looking around and seeing if she can find something sacred here. That part is taken over by the archdeacon in the cartoon. So he isn't a crazy, lusty monster for the entirety of the musical. You actually see him becoming more and more haunted by her, even following her to a brothel and spying on her and Phoebus through a window. It's a growing obsession, at which point there is the ""Heaven's Light/Hellfire"" sequence. The build-up is a bit more intense than an immediate switch, though the cartoon is limited in time, so that is fine. 

All of this to say: thirst fanfiction for him is.....well there's always a community of people who write gross stories about gross people because they are perceived as sympathetic. Frollo is hardly sympathetic, but he has much more depth in the stage musical. Granted, I haven't read the book because I'm not interested in the creep factor and Victor Hugo clearly basing a character off himself. And the assumption that he'd have a flock of harem is...really gross and in such a strong contrast to who he is. 

Yes, this is armchair philosophy. Yes, everyone has the right to do whatever they want. But like...the character arc is so important. At least to me.

Wanna know how to handle this, my psych friend? Pavlov her. If she is annoying, pull out your phone and ignore her. This is going to take every fiber of patience you have left. Or start singing. Or whistle. Or tap your heels. Keep yourself calm and get out if you can. Don't let her provoke you. 

Obviously punishing bad behavior isn't working, so figure out what she likes and use it as a bargaining chip. It's just like toilet training. If she stops when you ask, give her chocolate (or something that won't get you in trouble). Shower her with love. Watch a stupid cartoon. Reward her for what she does RIGHT. 

Don't keep the reward the same every time though, because then she'll expect chocolate or whatever every time, so mix it up. Reward the positive. Ignore the bad behavior. Children do not respond well to negative reinforcement, so don't give her ANY negative reinforcement. Don't give her ANYTHING if she is acting in a way that does not correspond with the behavior you want out of her.

It has been tens of  thousands of dollars. It has been over two years. It had been a lot of crying and agony and fury that she had gotten this far, and this actually has to go to trial, regardless of the obvious lies in her report. He is my ex because he finally told me that it was obvious that supporting him through this, and EVERYTHING, was killing me. And I shouldn't have to be here through this.

I know how far bullshit like lies can go. And it's still going. He's been arrested at gunpoint. He's been racially discriminated against. 

And that is still not the worst thing that has happened to him. 

I understand your trust issues. They're very real. And if anyone should rage against false accusations, it should be me. But regardless of the pain it has caused me and how it completely flipped over the table and essentially ruined our lives, I know that there are worse things that you can do to someone. My assumption is that you have a friend, family member, whoever going through this. The only thing I can say is that our justice system is a joke, and I have no faith in it. And I am so sorry that this is happening. I'm so sorry that we have a system that is okay with this. 

But the flip side: how many women AND men have been attacked, yet they are too afraid to come forward because of things like this? Tonight I spent time with my male friend who was assaulted by a female over the weekend. He didn't even really consider ""sexual assault"" until I said those words. Our justice system also allows people to get away with sexually assaulting people, but there isn't proof and there is real fear about saying anything because of angry blowback. 

Shit is fucked up and shit. It's all just a joke. But I think it's still important to remember that you can still do worse things to another person, and this is not THE WORST, though it is quite fucking terrible. I wish you the best in this."

popularopinion,facbpet,t3_e8a7gs,1575936652.0,"I think there are a LOT of things in line before we reach this on the list of bad things to do to someone. And I think you're speaking from something personal that is making you angry, which I get."

I do know that people who are unemployed and really trying to find a job struggle. Filling out application after application is so disheartening, so I can see why somebody would half ass it after a while. It gets so depressing."
AskReddit,faay26a,t3_e87wos,1575915102.0,"This is perfect timing for my life. 

Teach myself to feel better looking. I'm back in the dating pool. I have never gone on dates or done the courting thing. I'm 24. People never really took me on dates. They just always got into a relationship. 

So right now I hate my body (it's really not AWFUL. I just have a condition that gives me some undesirable fluid pooling in my thighs and knees). I hate my face, and I don't feel like dating is going to work because I am so terrified. Not terrified of rejection, per se. But terrified of my body being the reason for rejection. 

So today, I can take steps to love myself more. I'm eating healthy, I'm going to start wearing makeup, and I am taking Krav Maga classes. Wish me luck."

I was bullied because my friend needed a whipping boy for her personal life struggles (divorce, her mom trying to OD. Like, big stuff). Then she pedalled back, whatever. But the conclusion is that people are nasty. Especially Reddit people, who don't seem to read into a comment and think about it."
FragileWhiteRedditor,faar5gd,t1_faaorj0,1575912463.0,Hmmm. I think that's a good point. I'm sorry that you were bullied.

relationship_advice,f9qf7m5,t3_e6fs4c,1575560144.0,"I'm also in a state of utter heartbreak. Very different situation, but still that feeling of being discarded and really, really hurt. Also in that state of ""I am way too tired to think about love now, or in the future"". Like, no hope or energy to think that you could do it again. 

I'm glad you're keeping your people around. Godspeed."
