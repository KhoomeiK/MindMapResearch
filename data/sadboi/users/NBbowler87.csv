It‚Äôs just the same sprout in a dirt pile from when I planted it.  Did I do something wrong?  Is it maybe too close to the water?"

The light blinks a yellow left arrow on one road, and the person in front of me sat for 6 seconds before they went, and even then, they took another 8 seconds to actually turn completely.  Made me wonder what the  heck they were doing"
MtF,fic2x9n,t3_f79fs5,1582336298.0,"Excellent post.  Just because their bodies were formerly male doesn‚Äôt mean they still have their male parts, nor does it mean that they are a top/dom.  We need to flip the script on this trope"

GreenBayPackers,fewmwzd,t3_eqofbj,1579415141.0,"I‚Äôve got a close friend on the internet who, unfortunately, is a Niners fan, mainly because he grew up in the Bay Area and enjoyed the years of the dominance in the 90s.

We poke fun at each other with memes and whatnot, but at the end of the day, it‚Äôs just a football game, and we‚Äôre gonna remain friends no matter who wins.  We wish each other good luck and both hope for an exciting, well-played game.

Obviously, I wouldn‚Äôt be a fellow cheesehead if I wasn‚Äôt chanting ‚ÄúGo Pack Go‚Äù at every opportunity (especially since I live in Wisconsin now) but here‚Äôs looking forward to a great game, and may Aron Roger bless our offense with many touchdowns, and our defense with sacks and interceptions!"

While the Cards May have won tonight, the silver lining is they cut the deficit for the first Wild Card spot down to a 1/2 game for us.
