ACL,fqqvvmx,t3_gkdu02,1589572895.0,Mine is two years post op and it still sticks out
ACL,fqqvspm,t3_gkdu02,1589572852.0,Lol my sticks out worse than that and it does definitely keep me from extending my knee straight out. I would get it looked at

ACL,etbk11a,t1_et9i2im,1562649504.0,Was it keeping you from bending your knee well? And could you feel it?
ACL,etbjw3y,t1_et97y2f,1562649363.0,You should definetely talk to your doctor and maybe think about getting a scope done
ACL,et8b4bb,t1_et7slht,1562551573.0,What are cyclops lesions?  And yes

Fostercare,es5jhsw,t3_ajf03r,1561614265.0,I move 3 different foster homes before i came to my last and permanent foster home. The first 3 all made me feel like my problems werent important and i honestly just wanted to kill myself every step of the way. I was basically just there to clean and take care of the other kids in the house thats all.
Fostercare,es5j6dp,t3_bna3h4,1561613920.0,My experience i went into a foster home a hour away and was labeled as an emergency placement so i could not stay very long only until i could find a place i could stay longer.
Fostercare,es5j1ci,t1_eq9j7er,1561613768.0,Arent you scared that he might get touchy with your siblings though? I wouldnt trust it
Fostercare,es5izt3,t3_bxtorp,1561613721.0,When i went to foster care at 15 i didnt have any friends to stay with but they asked do i have anybody can call to come get me . so most likely they will try and place you with you grandma the first night but if tell then the reason why you cant they will not put any of you in that house and your younger sibling will more than likely go into foster care.

Advice,es3w630,t3_c5nwi2,1561571906.0,Yes. Ive went from being an only child that doesnt ever go anywhere or interact with ppl to going into foster care and living in a 5 person home. Now everybodys like you have nothing to complain about you have everything you want but they dont understand how i feel. All these new people here to comfort and help me i still feel alome. Its such a hard feeling to shake and i find myself hiding in my room by myself 24/7.
