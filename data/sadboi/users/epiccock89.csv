Assuming this sub is composed entirely of US citizens (I'm sure its not) we can use 300 million as a starting number. 4 percent of 300 million is 12 million people. I'm gonna make a stupid assumption here that theres an equal amount of people from the ages of 1-100 alive in that group, and so I'll only count people from the ages of 13to 33 as likely to be on reddit. So in that 20 year range we have  20 percent of the population as likely frequent internet users leaving us with 2.4 million possible infps. I'll just take a shot in the dark and say that well over half of those don't know what mbti is or don't pay much attention too it.

Obviously you have people who love you, who care about you, and it would hurt them greatly if they lost you. Don't  wish you could be a hero, be one. The greats in life aren't always great, they weren't always someones savior, they got their by continuing to live life. When things go wrong, learn lessons from them and move on, come out a better person. Volunteer, help people, let your life be in service of other. One day someone will see you for the altruistic,kind, good person you are and you'll start a family. And then years later when you're old, you'll die a hero. An inspiration to the people around you.

It means they see potential but either are unsure or don't think it's a good idea. So maybe there is a possibility of eventual romance, but take it from me the worst thing you can do is push that. I agree with amacita on the solution bit. Try to move on, be friends and nothing more, makes sure you're not focusing way to much attention to them, better yourself, date other people. This really is the best option you can possibly take because if they never do come around then you have moved on anyway, it's also like the only way to get out of the friendzone. Sometimes, on occasion, rare as it may be seeing you grow, be independent, and cultivate healthy relationships with others is what causes them to decide there might be real potential there. It also may help you take off the rose colored glasses and see the person for who they are, people tend to almost idolize the person who puts them in the friend zone, but actually acting like a friend to that person and not just hoping to get together with them can show you the nuances to who they are, it can save a lot of trouble later down the line."

 Bob in the walking dead has a great line before his death, he says ""It went the way it had to, the way it was always going to"". It sets me at ease to think that things will fall where they may. Yeah initially its terrifying to think about how little control you truly have over your life, but after that wears away you can find great comfort in it. You will play exactly the part you're supposed to in the universe, you aren't dead yet because it's not your time yet, and when it is then it will have always been.
