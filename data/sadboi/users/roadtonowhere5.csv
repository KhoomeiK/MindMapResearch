Advice,fonunhp,t1_fontyyl,1587926797.0,"What religion do your parents practice? Of Christianity, what denomination? This all depends on how you want your relationship with your parents to be in the near future. I have went through this exact same situation. My parents are Baptist...born and raised. They were not happy about this news at all. Honestly, if your parents are very accepting people I wouldn‚Äôt bother telling them. They are most likely very set in their beliefs and want you to follow in their ways. This news will only put a wedge in between you all. It might possibly make them force religion on you even more. However, these are just my opinions. At the end of the day, it is completely up to you what information you divulge to your parents."
Advice,folq4d3,t3_g85afa,1587867846.0,How old are you?
Advice,foliixa,t3_g82oui,1587862967.0,This boils down to the fact (I‚Äôm going to be blunt)...your neighbor doesn‚Äôt have a real issue to give a fuck about. Her lack of not having a fuck worthy thing to care about means that she is projecting on to you. You clearly give a fuck about your privacy and which is understandable. Your neighbor most likely has no real sense of purpose anymore and is reaching at any little small thing that gives her a sense of purpose and authority. She is also probably lonely. Being lonely makes people bitter and resentful. Watching you and your family probably provides her with a sense of entertainment and she probably doesn‚Äôt have insight to realize it makes you uncomfortable. Let‚Äôs be honest a lot of older people are just nosy in general.

However, that was over 7 years ago. I have since traveled around the world and graduated college with honors. I know that I am not ignorant but I still remember all the comments. They have stuck with me over all these years. Fear of being judged for my accent has stopped me from doing many things. I would tell my friend to talk to the person. If someone made fun of my friend over their accent I would not think highly of that person. I really struggle with self confidence and my accent seems like a major flaw to me."
