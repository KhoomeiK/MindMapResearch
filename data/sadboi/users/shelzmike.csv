I agree that AnnualCreditReport is the best for reports. That isn't what I was talking about. I probably wouldn't recommend CreditCheckTotal to clients either unless they are willing to pay the 29.95 monthly fee; however, for $1 you can get all of your FICO scores, and not just FICO 8 either, I mean ALL your FICO scores. It is a 1 week trial that, if you don't cancel before the 1 week is over, converts to a 29.95 a month service. Cancelling is easy though and the best part is that you can do this $1 trial every 30 days. Just gotta be smart about it and you won't get screwed out of 29.95. 

Also a fairly recent thread on myFICO:    [https://ficoforums.myfico.com/t5/General-Credit-Topics/CreditCheckTotal-Finally-merged-with-Experian/td-p/5438679](https://ficoforums.myfico.com/t5/General-Credit-Topics/CreditCheckTotal-Finally-merged-with-Experian/td-p/5438679) 

So, you are absolutely logical to not recommend it to your clients, but doing so under the guise that it is an information harvesting site, not owned by Experian/scam is patently incorrect. That is all I was saying."

[https://i.imgur.com/IVAePgk.png](https://i.imgur.com/IVAePgk.png)

And you are right, Experian offers free monitoring. However, this is another service they are trying to sell you and it is different. It is great for accurate scores from all 3 bureaus (and not just FICO 8, you get them all). It has been around for years. Basically, if you sign up for a 1 week trial, that is $1, you can get all of your FICO scores. After a week, you start getting billed 29.95 per month for the service IF you don't cancel before the week is up and it is easy to do. The best part is that you can do this once a month. No joke. Been doing it for several years now (not every month, just when needed). They are banking on people forgetting and being lazy and sniping that 29.95 if you don't cancel. 

[AnnualFreeCreditReport.com](https://AnnualFreeCreditReport.com) is still the best choice for reports, but I have found this service to be the cheapest/best option for all of your FICO scores. It's honestly kinda sad that so many people on this sub think it is a scam and aren't using the benefits of it. To each their own I suppose, but it is legitimately an Experian product. 

Here is a post on myFico talking about how they integrated CCT and Experian logins, though it has longer been a part of Experian before then.

I had just tiled my first time on the floor and that was..much easier. I was also working with larger format tile and had to backbutter everything. I tend to get a little stressed when working against the clock (i.e. POT time) and being somewhat of a perfectionist. The ramp up was actually pretty quick on how well I did, the next couple of days got much easier, much more quickly. So, the earlier tile has more thinset in between than the stuff I put up in the latter days. 

I do keep reading about not using the oscillating tool for this and while I understand the risks, I haven't had an issue with it really. I am being super careful and am almost finished. For me it works pretty well. These are not super fancy or delicate tile so maybe that makes it a little easier. 

When I do my kitchen here soon, I will do a much better job at paying attention to the thinset oozing out. My biggest issue was that I was using a tile leveling system, which worked fantastically by the way, and I'd get a lot oozing out around the part that goes behind the tile and it was fairly difficult to clean in all up."

Someone can threaten you to vote a certain way but ultimately they have no control to do so at the point of voting. However, this is much more easily achieved if mail in voting. I'm not saying it would be pervasive, but it does open the distinct and easily possibility of it happening and that is a problem. If we have no freedom at the polls, what do we have then? Think about families where there may be a controlling faction in a household with a strong political opinion one way. They force everyone in the house to vote a certain way or worse yet just fill it in for the. Sure, the person could report it, but a.) Doubt that would happen if the situation of control exists in the first place and b.) How could you possibly prove it without recording it?

I grew up on a farm way in the middle of nowhere but also lived in Chicago for awhile and now living back in small town/semi-rural but within 30-45 minutes to a couple of bigger-ish cities. Wouldn't trade the situation for anything. It's so much better in so many ways than living in a big city. Suppose it all depends on age and station in life but we are looking to buy a new house even more rural to do some homesteading/off grid."

news,fnz8pbz,t1_fnyraw1,1587388854.0,"Your explanation wasn't uneccessary as I know how a franchise works. It is beside the point in this instance though. Many franchisees own more than one location and many only own one. Regardless of the franchise benefits, they don't have a bunch of cash on hand or other liquid assets or even, in many cases, extreme net worth to be able to survive such a situation. 

If I were to own an independent mobile phone store and sell all brands and even offer plans from the various carriers, I would be benefiting from the R&D of the manufacturers, their marketing, the products, but that doesn't make me a large business simply because there suppliers are. I get that isn't what we are talking about here but it really isn't that much different. Anyone that doesn't consider the local Wendy's or McDonald's, franchisee a small business must not actually know how it works. Many times the profit margin for these places is quite thin. They are not a small independent business, but they are a small business."

Virginia,fnygft0,t1_fnxmq4j,1587362336.0,"Yes, but it is also true that those same docs would tell you that the best way to never have anyone get a virus ever is for everyone stay at all times, always. The reality is, once again, back to testing. However, that is an untenable solution. Unless everyone gets tested every single day, it's not going to really help stop transmission. The antibody tests are really the only thing that can really help. However, what does that mean? Ask an epidemiologist and they will say, those without the antibody are at risk of catching and spreading the virus so they should stay home until a proven effective vaccine is developed. Telling a group of people they can't participate in society and are essentially de facto prisoners of the state is absolutely not a workable solution, no matter how much ""sense"" it makes or what doctors say."

Had the same thing happen to us last year, 65 year old septic finally gave up the ghost and for quoted seriously high numbers and, well, we just didn't have it plus it is a small house and that cost was a serious chunk of equity so I decided to do it myself. Rented the mini-ex and concrete saw. Cost me a total of around $2700 plus $100p to the town for the sewer connection. It was quite a bit of hard work, but saved a ton. Disclaimer: not recommending anyone do this. Depending on the grading and access, it can have a whole lot of risk involved and is inherently dangerous if you don't know what you are doing."
