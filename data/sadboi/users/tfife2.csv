Do you mean that they don't want you around while you are dating or they wouldn't want you around even after you hypothetically got married? Why do they think it would confused the soloist teenager?

What exactly can't you get over?

No, of course not. Are you out your partner or neither of you planning on keeping secrets from potential kids?

How? Kids need love and care and patience and guidance and honesty, but they don't need their parents to always fit into boxes of what is most typical.

What is the 'this' that may or may not get better?
