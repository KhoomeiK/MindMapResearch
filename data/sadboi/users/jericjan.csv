GiftofGames,fqgj14k,t3_giowsh,1589347563.0,"A bit of a copy-paste from my previous request but here goes.

When I first found out about Minecraft when I was young, I instantly fell in love with it. The concept was just so fascinating. Having this ability to build anything your heart desires, any redstone machine, and any structure you could ever think of. As cringey as it was, I used to watch those Minecraft parodies on YouTube like Revenge and Don't Mine At Night. Fun Minecraft YouTubers like CaptainSparklez and SkyDoesMinecraft were fun too. Complex and amazing builds made by players like Mumbo Jumbo and Grian would always blow my mind. Minecraft is just such an incredibly creative game. There's so much you can do. It would always amaze me how people could recreate real-life complex structures and be as close to the original thing as possible, with all the correct proportions and everything.

Having seen all of those fantastic things Minecraft was capable of, I decided that I needed to get a copy as soon as possible. Although I was a kid when I first discovered Minecraft, I still am today. I'm 17 now and still not old enough to get myself a credit card. My parents usually don't purchase any online services or programs, and they told me they didn't want to ""waste"" money, so that wasn't happening. Lame excuse, but yeah, there is no way I could purchase this game right now. Most of my neighbors are very unapproachable, and considering the current situation we're in, they definitely don't want anyone else near them.

Around a year ago, my parents bought a laptop that was way better than the previous one we had. Looking at the specs, I noticed that it could run Minecraft. When it arrived, I got excited. I knew this was one step closer to being able to play Minecraft finally.

What happens next? Well, being the scum that I am, I pirated the game. Initially, I wanted to test if it could run alright, but for the most part, I was impatient and wanted to play it really badly. I booted the game, and to my surprise, it's not perfect 60fps, but it's definitely playable. I was overjoyed.

Now, if I already have a pirated copy of the game, then isn't the problem solved? Why would I be asking here for one? Well, one day, the Build The Earth project was created. The idea was to gather people from around the world to build the entire Earth in 1:1 scale. That's crazy. Normally, I wanted to join in and contribute. It felt like it was my calling. But, you could only join with a legit copy of Minecraft, and my pirated version wouldn't cut it.

Also, OP, you are an absolute hero for making this post. I don't even care that much if I don't get it. I'm just glad that at least one dude here is going to get it. So sorry if this comment looks too long and unnecessary, and thank you if you actually read this entire thing."
