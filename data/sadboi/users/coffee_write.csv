I think your late dog would love to know you're being taken care of by another, and that you have saved another dog's life and have given it a new home. Perhaps it's their way of sending you some love. <3 I'm so sorry for your loss."

bipolar,fhgc61y,t3_f2x2cn,1581563452.0,That makes a lot of sense! I like how you broke it down like that; it's good to keep in mind to help keep things in perspective when going through shifts.
Petloss,fhd138c,t3_f2bfjk,1581475066.0,"I tell him goodnight and good morning every day. His ashes are in a box where I have a lamp I turn on at night and off in the morning and I touch the box and say hello. I have a pendant necklace with his ashes that I wear every day, so he's always with me. So you're definitely not the only one!! It is comforting to have them, and yes it may be a coping mechanism, but that's not a bad thing."

doggrooming,fgkorj0,t1_fghlvpa,1580870324.0,"There are definitely exceptions to every rule!! If it's what's best for the dog then I have no problem for it. It sounds like you're doing everything to make her the most comfortable, and that makes you a fantastic pet parent! Do you know if your groomer would make a house call? I did a lady's schnauzer at her house when he got to the point where she didn't want to do vaccines on him because he was so old and would stress out so badly, but still needed to be cleaned up. That might be an option for you too, just to make it even easier on her."

I had a cat who didn't like my little sisters because they were loud and obnoxious, but one time one of them got really sick and he laid with them the entire time until they were better. Your cat knows, and he's only cuddling with you to comfort you. Enjoy it, he's trying to cheer you up! I hope you can dig yourself from the funk, that's never a fun place to be."
depression,ffgsb1s,t3_etd5c4,1579913784.0,"Those are my exact thoughts too! I always felt like everyone would be happier if I was gone, and that I was actually doing them a favor. When I have been in that mindset I don't think anything could be said to make me feel better or see that it was a disease talking. Just time to get better or hospitalization. I don't think people know how to approach the subject or what they should say. They mean well, but sometimes it's counter productive."

I hope the week treats you well."

You have an amazing wife to understand and stay with you through the toughest times. I did something similar when my now husband and I got together, and he too didn't want to give up on what he thought we could have and stayed. It's only been the past few years that I've really tried to get help and work through things, but had always thought I was just depressed until I got on meds that were for bipolar and it clicked that that made WAY more sense. I'm sorry we have to go through the shit to see what's important, but it's nice knowing I'm not alone. I appreciate you sharing that!"

BipolarReddit,fb5zn5g,t1_fb39ypa,1576537767.0,That sounds awful in its own way! Do you use a lot of lotion too? Probably good to help keep your skin moisturized with all the washing and alcohol.
BipolarReddit,fb5zke2,t1_fb35h1u,1576537715.0,That's true! I try to shower before bed so it can air dry or it would take for.ev.er.

BipolarReddit,fb5zgay,t1_fb311kd,1576537634.0,That's awesome! I'm so oily it just makes me super greasy to not shower unfortunately.
BipolarReddit,fb5zblm,t1_fb3b9t9,1576537544.0,"Yess me too! A lot of people have said cutting their hair shorter helped a ton with making it easier to shower. I really don't what to cut my hair, but is probably worth thinking about. I'm glad I'm not the only one too!"

BipolarReddit,fb5yaxc,t1_fb3zh33,1576536851.0,"That's really interesting, and makes sense since I've always thought companies made these 'great products' to lure money out of us all! Seems there may be something to that."
BipolarReddit,fb5y3v7,t1_fb5b1ch,1576536723.0,Smart thinking!
BipolarReddit,fb5y2f0,t1_fb4pjc9,1576536696.0,"Yes exactly!! That's a perfect way to do it. I'll play music and get myself 'hyped' and excited to do something, plus feel good about it if I'm looking good too like you said. It does bring out the hypo, but that's better than being home depressed right? And I love your trying to find the people you can push the limit with. LOL"

You're right, once there it might be like well might as well shampoo my hair while I'm here, etc. I know what you mean, I'll sometimes put makeup on if I'm not feeling well, because maybe if I think I look good I'll feel good! Fake it til you make it."
BipolarReddit,fb34nrq,t1_fb2tjux,1576464159.0,"That's a really fantastic plan. I unfortunately don't have a tub, but may have to look into if that's something we could install!"

(at least me, lol)"
BipolarReddit,fb34a4f,t1_fb2pcjo,1576463911.0,"Yes exactly. If I've been sweating I know I need to shower and will, but if not it's just like why bother? Glad you and I both aren't the only one!"

BipolarReddit,fb30sr9,t1_fb2frpg,1576461588.0,"Those are great goals to set for yourself. I've been trying to make it a goal to shower every day and failing, but I really like your idea of doing it even if it's just a rinse and soap."
