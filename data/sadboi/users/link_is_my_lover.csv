Why are they going to try to go for women they like when they offer nothing of substance to them? Not only women, but people in general?

You have to have a sense of self-worth and a purpose you are driven to get out of bed for every morning: to be the best version of yourself (not eating junk food and watching Netflix all day, but something that forces you to level up mentally, emotionally, and physically). This will bring you your sense of efficacy and internal validation, all of the external validation is a byproduct of it all. Really just march to the beat of your own drum and engage in war for the fight to attain your dreams. The journey and process is the definition of your self-worth and value, not the end result (which is another byproduct of your journey to achieving excellence).
