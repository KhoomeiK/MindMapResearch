AmItheAsshole,fmf0eun,t1_fmeu10f,1586017406.0,As a second language learner you always try to fake it until you make it. So for some time all accents are fake sounding until they aren’t. End of story.
AmItheAsshole,fmezp3z,t1_fmenbfj,1586016984.0,"That’s not exactly true or annoying, everyone learns accents differently and are able to accurately reproduce them at various degrees and some choose simply not to learn any accent. Most people when speaking in English would prefer to have an American or British sounding accent and no trace of their native language. In my experience learning English as a second language, you just end up choosing whatever English accent is more convenient for you as long as you can be understood, but the decision is very much dictated by your strongest impression of the specific accent early on. If OP was in Germany and then all of a sudden went to England and the British accent clicked with him, is perfectly reasonable that he then kept it and tried to improve it over time even if he only stayed there for a month. The goal of a second language speaker is almost always to try to speak with the targeted language’s accent that sounds best to them. Myself, I’ve done a bit of back and forth between American and British accents in the past. First, I went with American because I was listening to American music. Then, I went for two weeks to England and I liked the accent so much I tried to switch over to British. It didn’t work well because British accent is harder for me for some reason. Eventually I switched back to a “west coast” American accent. 

OP is NTA, that girl doesn’t understand the nuances of learning a second language. What are you supposed to tell her if she tries to learn German? “Don’t you dare try to learn German with a German accent, you must keep your broken British sounding German accent”?That’s ridiculous.

Edit: spelling."

Also, even though Spain wasn’t directly involved in WW2, the post-civil war period was pretty brutal for normal folk, especially if they had any sort of link with the regime’s opposition — remember, it was a fascist dictatorship."

Anxietyhelp,fbiy8cm,t3_edkzyx,1576919210.0,"So glad you reached out to this community! But also, try to talk to your family, friends or teachers about it, even if it’s hard. As other people have pointed out, anxiety gets better and easier to deal with when you don’t bottle it up. And also, no, you’re not alone in this and that’s a huge comfort. One last thing, if you’re not seeing a therapist and you don’t think you’re going to, I suggest you read and learn about cognitive behavioral therapy. CBT is going to give you tools to deal with your anxiety. Good luck, and keep reaching out :)"

booksuggestions,ervcxaf,t1_ert3s46,1561312515.0,Also check out “The remains of the day” by Ishiguro. The way he describes settings and emotions is amazing. He tends to write stories about unfulfilled love and about having to hold back emotions due to duty or other and it’s incredibly moving. I think these themes appear in all of his novels and it makes them very powerful.

I’ve read “Voices from Chernobyl: the oral history of a nuclear disaster” by Svetlana Alexievich and it’s very good. This book is basically a collection of short interviews with people connected in some way to the disaster: people that used to live in Pripyat, Nuclear physicists, people that never left the exclusion zone or that left and went back, firefighters’ wives, exterminators’ wives, mothers close to the exclusion zone that had children after the disaster... really, you name it."

In terms of movies, I only got “Wind River” for you, which is mostly a thriller set in a Native American reservation. The movie is not very educational in terms of Native Americans living in reservations, but it does hint at some of the problematics that arise due to the remoteness of the locations imposed to these communities."
