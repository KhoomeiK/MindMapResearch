Besides ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", it is my favorite film of hers.

Admittedly, she is more of a tertiary character to Christopher Walken and Natalie Wood (her last film), Louise Fletcher's character is central to the plot.

She is such a fantastic actor."

startrek,fhphwa9,t3_f48eak,1581789991.0,"Voyager definitely has moments of greatness, but overall my dissapoinent with it comes from knowing what it could have been.

I always gave DS9 credit for paying off everything it setup in the pilot. Voyager lost its way and had to rely on ratings grabs via the Borg. I don't blame them for going that route but I believe if they stuck to their quasi-Battlestar Galactica premise it wouldn't have needed the Borg to lift the show.

But I contradict myself here because introducing Seven was also part of that ratings grab, she became one of the more interesting and well written characters in the showand was glad to see her back in Picard.

I found myself in rewatches not being as annoyed with Neelix as I was on its initial run, I still find the Doctor to be the best character the show produced. Giving him his mobile emitter was one of the best decisions they made."
