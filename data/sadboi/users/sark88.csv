AnimalCrossing,fp32xv2,t3_gaxz99,1588272182.0,This is amazing! Would you be able to share the bottle and jar pattern you put on the simple panels?
Anxiety,fp2q2pw,t1_fp10plt,1588265988.0,"Yes! That's the exact feeling I get. Sometimes my boyfriend will put up his hands and let me take a few punches, which also helps with that feeling haha."
Anxiety,fp2pta5,t1_fp0huax,1588265863.0,"Exercise is so great for mental health! Beta blockers were definitely a last ditch effort for me when nothing else was working including exercise, unfortunately."
Anxiety,fp2o6d3,t1_fp0k0vq,1588265089.0,"I take 1-2 (10mg) a day! Some weeks I need to take it almost every day at the onset of the symptoms, other weeks I won't need it at all. The first time I took it, it honestly was life changing. Feeling relief after feeling so terrible with nothing working was amazing. I hope it works as well for you!"
Anxiety,foz42tj,t3_gaarcc,1588184340.0,"My anxiety manifests in mostly physical symptoms. What really helped me was adding a beta-blocker (propanol) to my regular anxiety medication.

I get crazy heart palpitations, shortness of breath, nausea, jitters, head tingles, etc. Basically, I feel like I'm in the ""fight"" of ""fight or flight"" all the time. The beta-blocker blocks the effects of epinephrine (adrenaline) and really helps me. It does lower your blood pressure, so if you have low blood pressure it might not be for you, but it might be worth discussing with your medical doctor!"
