As long as my environment is clean in the sense of contamination, it can still be messy (if that makes sense)."

cats,fl23s5k,t1_fl1j7je,1584742288.0,"It’s a lovely idea, but my cat came to us around two weeks after my nan passed and was already at least a month old. Perhaps nan sent her our way though, knew I needed the help. Who knows."
cats,fl1d6cw,t1_fl0n1cy,1584726663.0,"Very close. She was/is my hero. I have very fond memories of being at her place whenever we visited. She had so many Scooby-Doo videos (she loved that dog haha) and always has a jar of lollies there, just for our visits. She was an amazing woman who always smiled despite all the bad things she has experienced. I think I was her only granddaughter too, so she may gave spoiled me a bit when she could haha."
cats,fl0a52z,t1_fl09wi7,1584698381.0,"Thank you. 
I still get sad when I miss her at times, but I know I had an amazing time with her, and just hope I gave her the best life she could have had. She was a feral before she found her way to us, so she probably would have died out there in the wild now that I think about it. 

Animals leave paw prints on our hearts, (even ones I don’t meet in person do, reddit has made me love so many animals around the world haha) but she definitely left a massive paw print on my heart, that is for sure."
cats,fl09sit,t3_floooj,1584697921.0,"I had a similar relationship with my cat. Few weeks after my nan died, this little orange and white kitten found her way to our home. I was 13. She became my best friend, my secret keeper, therapist and my study buddy. She watched (and helped) me become the woman I am today, and I watched her grow into a beautiful, caring and crazy cat, who loved “sneaking” onto my lap and tablet/book while I was reading. She loved me so much, and seemed to only tolerate others in my family. She was amazing and always knew when to cheer me up. I had 14 years with my amazing girl and I will love and cherish her forever, even though she is no longer physically with me. 

I hope you and your kitty friend have many, many, many, many (x infinity) more years together :)"
insanepeoplefacebook,fl05e2t,t3_fll3x9,1584692286.0,"What the actual hell? Story time: My 5yo woke up with a coughing fit last night, that bad he was panicking, which was making it harder for him to breathe. I calmed him down, tucked him into my bed and sat next to him while I called the Australian medical advice phone line, he has no fever or any other symptoms or any of the other things they are asking (to determine if it could be COVID-19)but I was so damn scared it was something series (kept a calm demeanour for his sake). Long story short, it is a mild case of Croup (found out by our GP today). But damn, the ‘what if’ scenarios that went through my already anxiety ridden brain, just made me so damn scared. I am not letting him go to school until he is better and I am making him wear a face mask when in public places (as kids his age sometimes forget the ‘cough into elbow’ thing), because as a member of society, especially during a pandemic, I have a damn responsibility to reduce the risk of spreading anything, even just the virus that leads to Croup (which can get pretty serious). But this person is seriously wanting COVID-19 parties? What the actual hell? Damn you person, please call child services, let them know you are a danger to your child and other children. This virus is serious, if it wasn’t, there would be no reason for any of these precautions people are taking (like how my son and I had to sit outside the medical centre instead of inside the waiting room at the doctors today until his appointment, which was a brilliant precaution). 

Please educate yourself. Education in times like this can literally save lives."
OCD,fl01zqf,t3_flffqw,1584688289.0,This is actually why I barely use social media. I have been doing it for a year now and my mental health has improved dramatically. It’s amazing how freeing it is to cut something/limiting contact with something that causes negative emotions.

asexuality,f3p9huy,t3_dhfo3u,1571050976.0,"It actually took me ages to realise that when people ask about fantasies they meant with sex... when it comes to partner fantasies, with me its always sitting in front of a fire reading a books in comfortable silence, or playing a video game together. At the most, hugs and snuggles while watching a movie."
facepalm,f3p9cou,t3_dhefo5,1571050776.0,"I take the pill because I now finally have regular and lighter periods with less pain. Before I was on the pill, my period would start anywhere between 20 and 45 days after my last one, and last between 5-11 days. Pretty much unpredictable. Now, I can be like “my period starts soon, better buy some tampons.”
I don’t even have sex, have never been a fan. So the pill is pretty much a period fixer for me. Which means I am losing less iron a month through blood loss, and need less iron supplements because I use to always have low iron levels."

mentalhealth,f31wd5n,t3_df03mj,1570586528.0,"I was diagnosed with PTSD and OCD. Anxiety play a huge part for those. Also suffer from depression and paranoia. If I didn’t get the help I need (medication and weekly therapy) I would be a non-functional human with agoraphobia (the potential is there for developing full blown agoraphobia as I am scared to leave my house and am scared of public places and people, but meds and therapy help me avoid the worst parts of it). 

Therapy is just as important as seeing a medical professional for a back ache or a sprained ankle. Could be just something minor, but if untreated can develop into something worse."
mentalhealth,f31w1gd,t1_f30v84c,1570586276.0,"I agree. I am always saying everyone would benefit from a mental health checkup once a year minimum. Like getting a general health check up. They can catch things that could be serious just from a general check up, like blood pressure."
fatlogic,f31npis,t3_df41gr,1570580073.0,"I lost 10kg (22pounds) by watching my calories and decreasing sugar. Calorie watching works, you don’t even need to do too much exercise with it other than walk more. Keep your calorie intake lower than the calories you use. It helps if you find out how many calories you burn on average just by being alive. 
I am an ex binge eater too. Psychological issues that led to comfort eating. Finally had enough when I almost reached 100kg (220pounds). And I feel so much better in myself these days too. When you are determined, you can do anything."
AskReddit,f2p4twp,t1_eyxlb8p,1570337612.0,"When I was a teenager I thought sex dreams were something that was just in the movies, like corny romance, never experienced them. Never had a sexual thought about someone. I have had sex before but only because my exes had expected me to pleasure them and I never enjoyed it. I always felt disgusting after. I have gladly been sex free for two years.
For so many years I thought I was broken because the idea of sex grosses me out. I found a name for my lack of interest and now I feel so much more confident in myself."
