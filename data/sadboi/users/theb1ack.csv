SuicideWatch,fd3k8y2,t3_eju9u7,1578159055.0,If being a coward means wanting to avoid pain then everyone is a coward to some degree. Killing yourself is just a way of avoiding pain. Being afraid of attempting suicide is just the same thing cause of the consequences if you fail
SuicideWatch,fd3ixzj,t1_fd3e3l6,1578158767.0,Maybe I'm old and cynical but I've the mindset of 'fuck society'. How about having more medical resources devoted to mentally ill people and having more jobs accomodating of mental illness. Oh yea and assisted suicide on the grounds of mental suffering. I feel like a lot people wouldn't be in places like this if society did better
SuicideWatch,fd3esds,t3_ejysqk,1578157646.0,"Yes, I definitely wish I could take my life back, make it so I was never born. The only choices left are living a pitiful & painful existence or risking it all on an exist that is not guaranteed, and one that can make your miserable life that much worse."
SuicideWatch,fd3ds22,t3_ejxvww,1578157317.0,"Wouldn't something like that be a slow and painful death. Most people who are suicidal want to avoid more pain. If death was 100% guaranteed and painless, that would be a dream job"
autism,fd38unn,t3_ejw5em,1578155796.0,Yep. I think for me it's just realising how different I am from everybody I know. Like people say they'll be accomodating to your mental issues but in the end they'll never really get what I'm going through. Its just isolating
autism,fd372ku,t3_ejuux4,1578155305.0,"Congrats dude. I know how hard it is to get a job, especially with trying to act normal in interviews. It took me a long time to get an office job, before that I did various jobs which were miserable. You can keep looking while you're working. Every job has something to teach you"
BPD,fd33pax,t3_ejufh8,1578154431.0,I definitely feel like a child mentally which is something I'm struggling with right now since I got taken advantage of recently. It really sucks being alone and having to be an adult and dealing with various mental issues. I realised my parents did a lot for me which I never had to think about. Which was a curse and a gift

BPD,fckz211,t3_ehqmle,1577736260.0,"Reading stuff about what people say their experiences with pwBpd is quite distressing, even here on reddit. We get called things like emotional vampires. And unfortunately that's the perception that's been created around this disorder. The media obviously worsened it with its potrayal of bpd. So when someone is manipulative in a relationship, people will be quick to claim bpd. At the end of the day bpd is a mental illness, one that affects relationships. Its an easy target to use and label on people who are being 'difficult'"
todayilearned,fcje6vv,t3_ehd5nm,1577684462.0,As someone who's tried this. Its a horrible way to go. Some of the worst pain I've ever experienced. But hey depression can make you desperate and wanting what appears to be an easy way out

SuicideWatch,fcgj65a,t3_eh3kbw,1577640672.0,"Oh yea, I remember in school I did well in academics, then depression and anxiety basically threw all that potential into the garbage. And as a kid with no proper support structure,  you dont learn proper coping skills, you end up withdrawing.  Which makes your anxiety and depression. Next thing you know you're an adult, and expected to handle everything yourself"
SuicideWatch,fcggxgq,t3_eh5tnr,1577639863.0,Pessimistic and hopeful. If things go well I can start over new somewhere else. But life has a way of throwing shit at me each year. Hope things go well for you friend

I just wish that if you've lived long enough and decided life wasn't for you, you could check out easily"
SuicideWatch,fcgerqi,t3_eh59rn,1577639249.0,"Totally agree with you. I went through a really rough patch, still kinda am, but it fucked me up to realise how nobody cared. All the people who I thought were friends or family. Not one single person helped me. Can't help but not trust people, no matter how pleasant they seem to be. The only help most people will give is some verbal platitude that's not helpful"

SuicideWatch,fbxdlnk,t3_eetnlk,1577181750.0,What I don't get is how people have so much energy to go out and do so many things. They get excited over so many things and I find myself just laying in bed having trouble getting up to make breakfast. Depression sucks
SuicideWatch,fbxdgk1,t3_eexk6h,1577181530.0,"It's kinda weird knowing I'm mentally ill. Just saying ""I am mentally ill"" is a big thing to process and accept. But I'm trying to be okay with it.

Your friends are probably more willing to listen than you'd give them credit for. If a friend of mine wanted someone to talk, I'd be there, cause it's not always about giving advice or solving your friends problems, listening can be enough. Also you might wanna give therapy another chance, being open with your therapist doesn't have to happen in a day. If you're not comfortable with a therapist, it's okay to look for another"
