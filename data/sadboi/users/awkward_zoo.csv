I was in 7th grade health class and 2 boys made a joke and I laughed. She thought we were being immature and making a joke about anatomy because we had gone over that earlier in the class (even though it was unrelated). She kicked all 3 of us out of the class for the rest of the semester. We had to sit in the hall and weren’t allowed to hear any lectures. She would bring us homework, quizzes, and tests at the beginning of class to figure out while we sat out there."
insaneparents,fpitt6r,t1_fpithki,1588648561.0,"But.... is this the same thing as a toddler being unable to hold it and go behind a bush? Is it better to have them pee in a bag and carry it home? 

I just think that’s nuts 🤷‍♀️"

I went to a girls’ night and the subject of kids came up. A comment was made about how everyone there were moms and I mentioned that I wasn’t. The next question I was asked was “Where’s your womb??” followed by everyone laughing. 

I don’t have any reproductive issues, but I was blown away that people are so insensitive and think that’s something funny to joke about."

When I was younger (11-12) my little brother and I were practicing our “sick” ninja moves. At one point, I told him I could do a flying double kick (even though I had never attempted that before) and he told me to prove it. 

I thought I was the shit and told myself, “I got this, no problem.” I tried to jump up and kick both of my legs forward, but this caused me to fly backwards and my head ended up landing on a metal folding chair that was in his room.
