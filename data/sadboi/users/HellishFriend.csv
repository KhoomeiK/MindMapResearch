misophonia,flh85bx,t3_foqsfm,1585157845.0,"I live with possibly the loudest man on the planet. Everything he does is loud. His walking, talking, even breathing is so loud and drives me nuts. I can’t stand to be around him but I don’t really have a choice. He has no care for my feelings on the matter either. I ask him to quiet down and he gets offended saying it’s “his house too so he has the right to make noise”. He also likes to sing off key all the time which literally makes me want to rip my hair out. I’m sorry for how difficult your life is right now. I totally relate"

AmItheAsshole,fe5tjyx,t1_fe56wox,1578874624.0,"Thank you. This meant so much to me, I cried a little. I will think about how I want to establish my boundaries. Also I wanted to clarify that in case anyone was worried my mom was not enabling him, she came upstairs and yelled at him when he was being rude to me, then comforted me while I was upset. She also said that I have the right to not talk to him until he’s sober and that she’s gonna make sure he follows through with rehab."
AmItheAsshole,fe3a9vq,t1_fe3a38a,1578847448.0,That’s fair. I told my stepdad I am 100% behind his recovery and I will support him but until I know he’s making a real effort I’m gonna be kinda wary

AmItheAsshole,fcna8mw,t3_ehrttw,1577807217.0,"Most definitely, YTA. I cannot believe the amount of people trying to justify your actions. Frankly, reading your post made me sick. I’ve dealt with the loss of my two day old cousin, and while he wasn’t my baby, the pain was unbearable. Knowing he would never have a chance to live his life made me miserable. His whole life was surgeries and pain before he passed. It was so hard on me that I can’t even imagine how your wife felt after losing her baby. 37 weeks is a baby. Having a stillborn is extremely traumatic- you’re so excited. You’ve named your baby, bought them all the toys they could want, decorated their new room, and now you’re ready to bring them into the world. But before you can even tell your child how much you loved them, they’re gone. 

If your wife has a history of issues during labor, this easily could have happened again. And you chose to leave her in such a traumatic moment. Your own wife, left to tackle both the worst pain and the worst anxiety possible. How can you live with yourself? If I was a father and my wife was giving birth I would be with her the whole time, holding her hand and making sure she was okay. That’s the least you could do. I hope she finds someone better than you, as you clearly don’t prioritize her safety or your own child’s safety. She could have died in the middle of labor. Anything could have gone wrong. You’re disgusting and selfish."
AmItheAsshole,fcmxr36,t3_ehw713,1577796865.0,"You’re NTA. When you have a child, the world changes. You find love in your heart that previously didn’t exist, That child is your responsibility- someone looking to you to find their way in life. Of course you love her like no other. She’s your baby. If your wife responded like that, she must have issues of her own."
