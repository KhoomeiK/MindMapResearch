AskReddit,fm9oul2,t3_ftx9gz,1585873242.0,I was driving downhill with my longboard at like 80km/h when a car came towards me. I didn't really had the chance to think of something because jumping off the longboard would've been a really bad idea while going that fast. In the end i decided to just drive on the field to my right where i flew off the board. I didn't really hurt myself that much but it was really frightening thinking i could've just crashed into that car and my life would have ended.
