The upside is finally doing important stuff that was getting moldy, the downside is it only happened because your lizard brain n refuses to engage with whatever new high importance task popped up.

I read that the sativa/indica thing has largely been crossbred into the equivalent of ""wine tasting"" science. It's all hybrids, and you really have to look for pure strains while they all advertise being predominantly one or another for marketing.

Have you asked your friends and family for help on this one? It sounds like she's unreasonable enough, you might be able to round up several people to tell her to fuck off.

You're doing what's required to take care of yourself. Aspergers by definition means you are functional enough to be independent with no major intellectual deficits, but it's no longer a ""real"" diagnosis. They've since rolled it into ""High Functioning""."
mentalhealth,f7k9iem,t3_dwmnok,1573799434.0,"Get a therapist, sounds like trauma. Someone to help guide you through managing the symptoms would be ideal.

Read into DPDR and how stress causes it, that's what the ""not real"" and ""foggy"" symptoms are. There's a survival mechanism in the brain of sorts that makes you disassociate under stress (car crashes, etc), but it can be stuck ""on"" for long periods of time. There's ways to manage it, and eventually you can get those symptoms under control. I have some experience with DPDR, you might want to look into strategies for staying grounded.

It's common to feel unsafe around things you associate with an extremely stressful situation. Getting around or managing that is going to require a trained therapist.

Hang in there, and be sure to talk to people in your personal support network when you feel you need it. This really should not be bottled up."
