We make jokes on how we are miserable and want to kill ourselves over the pressure of family, teachers, friends, peers, etc.. We are not happy. We develop anxiety disorders, depression, and other mental health problems from everything. We force ourselves to bottle up the self hate and loathing and act perfectly fine that way we don’t get betrayed or beaten, possibly sent to the loony bin. We just want to be happy.
