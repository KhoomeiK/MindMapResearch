Anxiety,fnm74t0,t3_g2kids,1587066256.0,"Anxiety thrives off of pulling you out of the present, making you think of the past or feel doom and gloom over the future.
A way to maybe break out of your spirals can be to anchor yourself in the present as much as possible. Take minutes to breathe, notice the surroundings around you, keep in mind the walls around that keep you safe, contained in you're own space, no matter what, you are safe, stay in this mindset for a while until your brain acclimates to staying in the present.
I also find a possible tip that may be a bit counter productive but *could* work is do the exact opposite. Let all of your negative thoughts flow through and dont try to resist them. Meditate on these thoughts in a way, and just self-reflect on then, rationalize what's reality and what's a fantasy your brain has come up with. Eventually after some time, you will come back to reality with a new mindset, or at the very least, you're brain will just be exhausted from thinking so much there'll be no more room for anxiety.
Lastly, think if your problems like this. If its something you can do something about it change, that's awesome, you can make things right. If there's nothing you can do to change it, that's awesome, no pressure at all to have to fix anything, just sit back and relax as you have done all you could.

Hope some of these have helped a wee bit, I'm do sorry to hear your dealing with these constant, unending feelings, but I know for a fact you can make it through this. You're strong, I know that just from the fact that you posted to ask here, there is no doubt that there is hope for you.
Good luck, we all believe in you!"
Anxiety,fnm5xoz,t3_g2kzle,1587065661.0,"Not being able to sleep at night is *literally one of the worst feelings on the planet*.
It's almost as if the stress of the day doesnt even end when you try to go to sleep, it follows you in what is supposed to be one of the most relaxing periods of the day.
It sucks, and I'm so sorry to hear you're dealing with this insomnia issue, all I can think of are a few ways to maybe curb this problem, things that worked for me at least.
The best strategy for me was getting up and going to bed at the *same time every day*, even if I woke up tired, I would soldier through the day, the brain loves consistency and will eventually adjust to your new schedule.
Other things that I find that help are staying off your bed as much as possible, maybe get into an indoor exercise routine to get the blood pumping and make relaxing easier, staying off caffeine, eating, and computer screens a few hours before bed really does help but I'm sure everyone told you that already.
Infact you've probably heard this a lot, if none of this works, there is no reason for you not to be able to go to a doctor who can help you curb stomp this insomnia. What you are dealing with is a real illness, and there are certainly real solutions that can help you overcome this.

The process may be slow, but I have no doubts you can make it back to a happy, healthy sleep schedule, no matter what it takes, make fixing this sleep problem your absolute top priority.
You got this, you're strong, and you can conquer this low point in life."

Anxiety,fm9z7fg,t3_fts49s,1585879944.0,"Don't feel messed up for feeling the way you do, trust me, in your current brain situation, why would you want to punish yourself for feeling relief?

I feel you though, while I cannot say that I know exactly how you've felt, I have felt very similar feelings of being lonely, even when friends are there in person, feeling isolated and unwanted, horribly anxious to interact with anyone you know, just because your brain is self-destructing at the mere thought of having a conversation.

It's so weird, right? Despite having people who you consider friends, you feel totally empty and like nobody is actually there for you, it's soul crushing.

While you may not currently know anyone who shares these feelings, please know, there *are people out there suffering like this too*. You are not some sorta weirdo for feeling the way that you do, and you are also not beyond the point of getting better and working to throw these negative feelings in the trash.

You say that your brain is throwing irrational thoughts at you, and you're just exhausted at the idea of living through this society anymore. It seems like this is a really deep-seated problem inside of you, one that requires support systems, maybe a therapist and psychiatrist if you haven't already, but just places where you can spill your brain and have all your thoughts said out loud can really help.

It may be tough right now, but keep going forward, because while you may feel alone, you certainly are not alone. We all in this together my dude, and we are gonna enjoy life if it fucking kills us goddamnit."
Anxiety,fm9xsn3,t3_ftwckg,1585878990.0,"Man, I'm so sorry to hear about all of these awful feelings you've had.
You've had it rough, things really suck right now, no doubt, no reason to sugarcoat anything, *life sucks*.

I want to reassure you that everything will be ok with time and effort, but we both know that there is no instant solution, anything that's going to pull you out of this rut will take a lot of time, energy, and patience, and that's what really sucks, yknow? The feeling that there is no hope, that you can never claw your way out of this pit that you've dug yourself into, and that your basically doomed.

While I can't be a guaranteed message for you, I want to say firstly that no matter how hopeless it seems right now, you are capable of pulling yourself out of this. Yes, it will take a lot of time, I would definitely recommend therapy and a psychiatrist if you haven't already sought out those support systems, but with enough effort and patience, I can assure you with confidence that things will slowly course correct themselves.

I am a strong believer in ""As long as you keep trying, and never stop trying, you will eventually be content"". I find most stories of those who have led the worst lives are those who gave up and accepted their misery.
So *don't give up, don't accept your misery!*

The feeling of being constantly uncomfortable is truly a horrible feeling, trust me I have at least felt a modicum of what you're experiencing, what I find helps me the most with this is to live in the present as much as possible.

When you keep thinking to the past or future, that is where your anxiety feeds on, and where I would believe the source of your troubles would come from before COVID was a thing. Lock yourself into the current moment, and don't give a thought to what was before or after. If you feel yourself slipping, look around, take in your room, feel every inch of your body, and take as much time as you need to bring yourself back to reality.

You question now whether life is worth living, I feel that staying in the present, while not an instant solution, does help make the little things in life more enjoyable, and those are your core reasons, THAT is what we live for. To jump from moment to moment until, soon enough, we find ourselves content and comfortable.

I know none of this stuff may help at all, but I just want to let you know that you definitely do not deserve all this shit that's happened to you, and none of this is your fault at all either. You are suffering from a sickness, and now all you need is the right treatment, and you are strong enough to overcome this. I know just from the fact that you posted all of this and what you've been through that you're strong enough to make it through this too.

Don't keep letting your brain lead you astray, fight for your happiness, it sucks right now, but as long as you fight, it won't last forever. We are all rooting for you!"
Anxiety,fm2cxw5,t3_fsm1px,1585694989.0,"Ah, I'm so sorry to hear about this really sticky situation you've found yourself in. If I'm being honest, it's hard for me to even think of the best possible course of action, but I'll try my best.

You shouldn't ever have to feel *obligated* to hang out with your friends. At least in my experience, there have been many times where I've been in a really negative place, and I tried to force myself to hang out normally with my friends. *It did not work out very well at all*.

If there's one thing I believe that a caring, real friend will do for you, its give you the space you need when you need it, so maybe instead of taking one long break from them formally, maybe instead just gauge how you feel from time to time.

If you're in a good place and feeling social, hell yeah talk to them, if you're feeling really down though and dont want to talk to anyone, dont ever feel obligated to hang out and mask your emotions anyway, it will just make you feel much worse. Your friends will understand if you need to spend a little time by yourself.

I guess what I'm suggesting is play it case by case? Your friends will surely understand if you need to miss something due to mental complications.

In the meantime, make sure you get your support systems strong and ready, because it sounds like you're in a dark place right now. Please feel free to confide to friends, family, a therapist or professional, me, as long as it's someone you feel you can trust, letting your thoughts and emotions out to other people can be not only a vital form of healing, but also help maybe create a bond with these blooming friends of yours.

And I know that you said all of your friends are wonderful, but if for any reason you feel you may be in a toxic relationship with any of them, or that they may be causing your anxiety instead of simply being a by product of it, then I would suggest yeah, long break, keeping toxic people around is a no go, make sure you are focusing primarily on yourself.

Because YOU are the most important person in your life. You are strong, strong enough to confide here on reddit for sure, not everyone can do that, you will make it through this, and we're all rooting for you to make it through. You got this!"
Anxiety,fly64fl,t1_fly4ij1,1585596234.0,"The jealousy is something that I relate to quite strongly, it can be hard to not feel envy when you think everything in your life is terrible.
Analyze why you think you need attention, is it because you feel lonely and want people to notice you? Try to surround yourself with any support system you can, friends, family, or therapist. Trust me, having at least one pillar of support can make you feel a ton less empty, never be afraid to vent to someone you trust.
And maybe, once you look into yourself, once you realize that you yourself are not a failure, you'll realize that you do deserve happiness like everyone else. It may not be here now, and you may have ed to work a bit harder for it, but it will come as long as you try every day to look and feel better about YOU, and once you feel good about yourself, I'm sure your feelings of jealousy will slowly start to subside as well.
I think a lot of this is a mission to achieve self-love, I am no professional on this but I hope that this has made your goal a bit more clear. Love yourself, because goddamnit you deserve it."
Anxiety,fly5h6l,t3_frurut,1585595894.0,"So first of all I want to assure you that you are *not being stupid in this at all*. You are in a super tricky situation, and right now are at a crossroads as to what would be best for your future, things are scary right now, so of course you ain't stupid.

In terms of taking the leave, well, that's really tricky. Maybe examine how long exactly you would be able to live off of just your wife's salary. Doing some math could lead you to a better conclusion than you might think, because if you can even just make it through the first month, that's a LOT of outdoor activity you dont have to do, and a lot of risk you dont have to put yourself in.

So, take my opinion with a grain of salt, but if you do the math and you think yall can live at least longer than a month on your wife's salary, then I think you could take that leave.

But even still, let's say you cant, let's say you still have to leave and go to work, as long as you take proper precautions and be extra careful, I'm sure you can save yourself from COVID (wearing gloves, hand sanitizer, etc.) I've been going out quite a bit myself for necessary errands and thanks to those tools I have been able to avoid the big sick, and I'm sure you can too.

Your brain is going to always paint the worst case scenario to you. Whether you keep working or take the leave, you must not let your negative thoughts consume you. Rationalize the negativity, understand in your mine that it is incredibly unlikely that the worst case will happen to you, don't let your brain make things seem scarier than they actually are.

You got this. Things are tough right now for you, no doubt, but you will get to the other side of this mess. You're strong, and more than capable of making it through this happy and healthy!"
Anxiety,fly4bt5,t3_frvar1,1585595285.0,"There is no doubt that things are really scary right now, and I'm sorry to hear about the disaster ripping through your hometown, that honestly sounds terrifying and I'd be freaking out too.

But try to take this moment to really, well, not think about the future?

I know it may be a stupid request, but I do know one of the things my anxiety will always do is keep me *away from the present*. I will always either be stuck in past memories, or panicking over the possible futures.

And I find that with every possible future I come up with, things will, more often than not, end up very slightly better than I expect them to.
I mean, how could it not, when you constantly Invision the worst case scenarios, of course what actually happens will end up a lil better.

The future is scary, but try to rationalize things in your head. Recognize that a lot of your fears may just be worst-case scenario panic thoughts, and try to rationalize those out of your mind. Always thinking the worst most certainly doesnt help, at least it doesn't for me.

Try to lock yourself into the present, take in your surroundings, take long, deep breathes, relax your muscles one by one, starting from your toes up to your head, and just live in the present. Your anxiety is going to try to tear you away from the now, but always keep in mind that right now, right this instant, *you are safe*.

You got this, and you will conquer this anxiety, I know your strong enough to do so simply by you posting here. Keep yourself in the present, and dont let your brain sabotage your future, you got this!"
Anxiety,fly3c5g,t3_frw7ay,1585594758.0,"I do not know exactly what you're currently going through right now, but I can tell one thing just from your post, *things suck right now*.

While I dont know what happened, it seems you fell into a bad situation, that this is certainly a low point of your life, and that you once again ""let your stupid brain ruin everything"" for you.

Even though things may suck now, though, does that mean that you yourself are a failure? I dont think so.

Take some time right now just to ask some questions to yourself. Why do you feel as anxious as you do? Anxiety itself is not only an uncontrollable illness, but it's also something many people like you also go through every day.
The LAST reason you could ever be considered a failure is because you have anxiety. The fact that you're still here, and still pushing, and still fighting to live with anxiety shows in leaps and bounds how much you're not a failure.
Consistently remind yourself that this anxiety is *not your fault*, because it isn't. You didnt do anything to deserve it, even if your brain tells you that you do. You are feeling sick right now, but that in no way reflects how you are as a person, but let's keep going...

How much do you feel like your thoughts are in your own head? Compare your situation in your head to what actually happened in real life.
Your brain is going to try its hardest to make everything seem hostile, every social signal negative, everyone is against you and by proxy, you are a failure, but that just isn't true.

Dont let your brain bring you down, look at the facts, people are so much more understanding than what your brain is telling you, and it's very rare that you will come off to them in the way that you may think. Remember how understanding people are, and that we all live in our own little bubbles, and the things that you think you fucked up they might not even have noticed.

It's going to be ok. I may not know you, but I know just from the fact that you posted here that you are strong, REALLY strong. Focus on you objectively, your talents and wants and passions, and I can assure you there is no chance there is ANY failure within you.

I may not be a professional by any means, but I know that you got this, you will grab life by the nuts and you WILL find your content future.
You will be ok. You are going to be ok. I'm sure of it, and we are all rooting for you."
Anxiety,flpqv41,t3_fqbd96,1585366307.0,"While I am far from a professional, I'll give it my best shot!

What you're experiencing *might* be anxiety, or it *might not* be anxiety. The question you have to ask yourself is if this choice of lifestyle is negatively impacting your life and stopping you from achieving your life goals.

Does this need to stay out of the limelight and be invisible harm you, physically or emotionally? Would you rather be more in the spotlight but your brain is holding you back? Is this how you want to live the rest of your life?

Because being just a reserved person is totally fine if that person is ok with being reserved, but if you feel you're being held against your will by your brain and nervous thoughts, that's how you know something's wrong.

Analyze who you are now, and who you want to be, and if they dont match up, I'd say see if you can seek some professional help, as they'll tell you for sure if you have any form of anxiety.

You got this though, crush life in your hands!"
Anxiety,flpqg4i,t3_fqbma9,1585365991.0,"So while I cannot diagnose you myself, as I am the furthest possible thing from a professional, you do seem to show *signs* of anxiety-like behavior.

It seems to show in just both your past and your behavior and reactions you've described here. Nothing is certain, but it is definitely *indicative* of something deeper going on in your head.

But my silly opinions dont matter. If you truly do feel like your brain is driving you crazy, then having a stranger like me tell you that you got anxiety may not help that much, I think if this stuff is really starting to negative impact your life, you should look into getting help or seeking a therapist.

It's definitely a scary road, knowing and accepting that something is strange within your head, but it is perfectly natural and reasonable to go seek any form of professional assistance, THEY will give you the diagnosis AND the tools to help you with treatment.

Best of luck to you and hope all is well. You got this!"
Anxiety,fl00jaa,t3_flotgd,1584686686.0,"Honestly, at least how I look at it, people are so self-interested and self-conscious that you could probably fuck up 50% of a presentation and no one would notice or care.

It's this thought that helps me get on stage, people watching you, whether a presentation or a show, are so much more lenient and generous than you think they are, because they have their own swarm of thoughts going on in the brain, why would they care if you stutter a few lines, yknow?

The only reason you're so frightened is because *you're the one on stage*. Your entire thought process IS your presentation, but that doesnt apply to the audience.

I've made so many mistakes in presentations, yet afterwards people would come up to me and wouldn't have even *noticed* any of my fuck ups.

Bottom line, dont be too critical of yourself, just go out there and act like one person is watching, because with how distracted everyone is in their own minds, that mayaswell be the case.

Also, it does get easier everytime with practice, keep a smile on your face and just show that you care and are enthusiastic, a shitty presentation can be boosted ten fold just by acting enthusiastic, I have proof.

First and foremost, you deserve rest and relaxation, time away from all this heinous shit happening around you. Keep in touch with friends and family and just keep that support system around you. Above all else, you should feel *comfortable*.

Because you deserve to feel comfortable. Life may be doing it's best to scare you, but you're strong as hell, I can tell just by the fact that you even posted here in the first place that you are beyond strong. You deserve to have your brain cease worrying about things after everything you've been through. Dont let your brain scare you with any irrational thoughts, and if any do end up appearing, disprove them yourself or talk to someone so they can disprove it for you. Your support systems are there to guide you through this tough time.

The anxiety feeling sucks right now, it really does, but soon enough, everything will calm down, and return to normal. It may take some time, but soon you'll look back on this and be glad, glad that you conquered this huge pit in your life journey.

It's a lot like how, when you're feeling sad, having a nice long cry can be really helpful and relieving.

It's like you have all this stress pent up in one place, and it all explodes into a panic attack where you let out all your energy. It's almost like you're exploding all of your negative energy out of your system. At least, that's how it feels for me.

Anxiety,fky6hft,t3_flejy2,1584642552.0,"This is kind of like the 'blind leading the blind' situation, but I'll give it a shot.

The hardest part of doing anything effort-wise is starting.

Starting is really fucking hard, you may feel anxious about how much you have to do, stuck in your thoughts of how you won't enjoy this, just generally unmotivated to start.

So set a strict, small time limit for yourself.

Say that, ""no matter what, I'm going to work on this for one hour"", work becomes much more manageable when you know you won't be stuck for hours doing shit you don't want to do, this will get you to *start* , and even an hours worth of work is better than no work at all.

Then, once you've started, it's going to be much easier to continue working, and then you essentially chain bursts of motivation together.

Picture how much happier you'll be knowing you got work done, give yourself breaks, reward yourself with snacks and other treats, because ANY work, even 5 minutes of work, is better than no work.

You got this, being motivated is hard, but if you take baby steps, I have no doubt this'll become easier for you."
Anxiety,fky5sim,t3_fleihi,1584642075.0,"Oh my lord

That is, well, I have to agree with you here, *that fucking sucks*

You have every right to feel the ways that you do right now, justified in fact, life is really screwing you in the ass and everything just seems hopeless.

There is no concrete, immediate solution to your problems here, but I'm sure you knew that already.

All you can do now is, well, take things one step at a time.

Your able to separate each of your current stressors into their own place, you can identify *exactly* what's causing your horrible downfall, so all you need to do from here is work your way up, slowly but surely.

Start with the small stresses, rationalize in your head why itll be ok, why that stress doesnt matter, then send that train car off, that stress doesnt matter anymore because you have fully rationalized *why* it isn't a problem.

Once you knock out the smaller stress, the larger problems will be easier to deal with. You'll be able to more easily communicate with your fiance your current issues, and you'll be able to figure out and accept what's happening with your child situation. These solutions, while not apparent now, WILL show themselves if you take things slow, steady, and make gradual improvements.

It's going to be hard, impossible some days. Dont hate yourself if you aren't successful, you dont deserve that hate, after everything you've been through why would you deserve to also hate yourself? You're a strong, capable person, and I'm not just saying that.

You're fuckin strong enough to make it through all of your shit so far, all of that stress, I certainly wouldn't have lasted through it, but you did.
You're strong, you are stronger than most, and its because of that, that I know you can make it through this.

We're all rooting for you to get through this, confide in people, let your friends know your problems, real friends are there to help, and it is soooooo helpful to just say these things out loud to people. Invest in therapist honestly if things aren't doable this way.

You've got this, you're strong, you've survived thus far and you will reach the other end of this really shitty hill life has thrown you on."

A lot of the problems here seem to stem from how you feel about *yourself*. At least that's what I'm guessing, you seem to hate yourself a helluva lot, saying you dont deserve this or that and just generally feeling like a bother.

At least from my experience, this is something anxiety is going to do to you.

It will make you feel lower than low, the biggest piece of shit in the world, you feel the need to apologize for everything because, well, you feel bad for existing, you feel terrible for bothering your friend with even the idea of being together.

I'll start by saying at least with what I've read, your brain is definitely lying to you. You are so strong to have worked your way through life this far, let alone with all your negative past experiences.
You are a strong person, you are a capable person, you are well liked by friends and family, enough to have a friends-with-benefits in the first place.
Dont let your brain convince you otherwise, dont let it make you think you dont deserve these things, because you most certainly *do*.

In terms of your relevant situation, I'm sorry to hear things have been so complicated. Not clicking with someone feelings-wise is really hard to get over, and this next bit of time may be more difficult for you than usual, but I can assure you, again from experience.
In the future, you will look back on this moment and wonder why you were even upset.
You have a timer above your head right now, and that timer is counting down, straight to when you will meet someone who feels the same way as you, it is only a matter of time.

For now, enjoy the company of this friend, they clearly want to spend time with you, even if the feelings may be hard, you can at least know that he's there, and still appreciates your presence, and dont let your brain tell you otherwise.

You've been through a lot, rest a little bit. Relax. Give yourself a break. You've earned it y'know. We're all rooting for you to overcome this minor hill on.your path to a fulfilling life.

I've had several nights myself where I just sort of sat In bed, didnt do much at all, your negative emotions are coming from a completely rational place and dont come close at all to reflecting who you are as a person.

Granted, this anxiety and panic is definitely running you through the wringer. In terms of suggestions, the most I can say is to, well, fill up your day, now that we have the time.

Ever wanted to really buckle down and make something productive? Now's your chance to really hone your skills. Have a bucket list of movies or games to complete? Any media really? What a better time than now to get cracking. Keep up with friends and family often through phone or online, share experiences, even if they are lessened by the distance.

It may be tough at first, the panic has it's way of keeping you in bed, you kind of have to force yourself at first, and it sucks a bit, but doing these things at a time like this will only become easier with time.

It can definitely be anxiety, if you go for a while under constant stress, its gonna wreak havoc on your body in ways you couldn't even guess. What your describing here seems to be stress-related symptoms, and pro-longed stress has absolutely no problem spreading out its issues over multiple days.

I must say that the things you've described are also very anxiety-like, panic attacks of course are a clear sign but not being able to focus and going into a dream-like state all seem very anxiety-ish. Anxiety always tries to take you away from the present, the current reality you are experiencing, and that's exactly what this sounds like.

I'm sorry to hear the psychiatrist cancelled on you, try finding a doctor though who could possibly work on over-the-phone appointments. In the mean time, confide in friends, family, let people know you are having these issues, venting to people you trust is the next best thing to putting your symptoms and mind at ease.

Anxiety,fkl46r5,t3_fj5s15,1584298106.0,"Oh man do I share those fears of yours, that mental illness will ruin all of my relationships, that is truly a scary thought.

It almost seems like you have a lot of pent up frustration at having to hide your anxiety, at having to put on this facade of being ""ok"" and ""fun to be around"" maybe? I'm just guessing though, because I can totally understand how you would end up in a situation like this because of held back emotions

And I'm positive that your friends understand this too.

You made an honest mistake, you apologized truly and honestly, and your friends know you're genuine. We're all humans who get overrun with emotions every now and then, so I have no doubt that your friends recognize this and feel no ill will towards you, we all fuck up a bit sometimes but as long as we acknowledge our fuck ups, like you did, then we show that we are truly people we want to stick with.

Just the fact that you acknowledged and addressed your mistake shows the quality of your character right there, you are a good person, and I'm positive your friends agree.

Dont let your brain lie to you. Maybe feel more free to talk to people about these things? Having outlets helps me out often when I'm in deep shit, and friends and family should be more than willing to listen to you and help you out.

You are a good person, and you will overcome this put your brain has thrown you into."

Anxiety,fj45w9i,t3_fbgfyy,1583000997.0,"The fact that anyone is chastising you for being ""weak"" during a break-up, an incredibly intense emotional moment for any person, just goes to show the character of the people who are mocking you for this.

Your ex really said some truly hurtful things about you, things that, at least based on what you've written, are really unfounded and not a part of who you are. You already know beyond a shadow of a doubt that you were strong and unyielding DURING the relationship, but this one moment during the breakup is infesting your brain and making you believe the over exaggerated lies being told to you.

Your brain is fixating on the negative things, and it may be hard to pull yourself away from those thoughts, but you cannot give your ex the power of letting these words affect you, because you KNOW they are unfounded.

You know that you're strong, you know that you are more of a true person than she will ever be, repeat this to yourself every chance you get, always think back to when you acted strong, because that was the majority of the time. Dont let your brain fixate on the one supposedly ""negative"" emotion you expressed.

You are strong, even if I dont know you, I can tell from you just posting this here, you are very strong."
Anxiety,fj44hv6,t3_fbg60q,1583000087.0,"Man I'm sorry to hear this slope you've been falling down. Anxiety is just a real kick in the nuts and you dont deserve all of these negative situations that have been thrown at you.

It is good that you have tried to make positive changes though, it's that kind of effort that's going to pull you out of this hole Anxiety has dug you into.

While this may be a bit of a ""blind leading the blind"" scenario, my advice would be to start small, accomplish small things every day that make you feel better about yourself. Maybe clean your room one day, go for a walk twice a week, get on a nice constant sleep schedule, people say that starting is the hardest part but the REAL hardest part is consistency, but once you're able to get into positive habits, they'll become much more natural and easy to you.

If you can get yourself on a train of positive, healthy habits, you'll start feeling better about yourself, and once you do that, the rest of your problems won't magically get better, but damn they'll be a lot easier to accomplish if my experience has anything to say about it.

It's a long road though, take small steps, this hurts right now but you're strong even if your brain says you aren't, and you can pull yourself out of this."

Me and four other friends made a Let's Play channel that just started uploading a month ago called Cactus Arcade. Now that we're a month in we wanted to get some audience input on a few aspects with our videos.  


More specifically, we wanted to know if our editing was a bit too sporadic (are cold cuts in footage ok or should we always lead into a cut in the commentary), we wanted to know how entertaining our commentary is at it's current point, and we ESPECIALLY want to know if our current thumbnail format is doing a good job for our videos. Of course, any other words of advice are super duper appreciated!  
Here is the latest episode of our Bloodborne Let's Play:

letsplay,evu384y,t1_evtyzhm,1564784549.0,"Hi Docimus  
I watched through the video and I gotta say there is a lot to love here. Your editing is very quick yet also not excessive, so it always felt fresh when an edit would appear. You also pull off the commentary very well, nice flow to your words, it sounds natural and you have a lot of genuinely funny moments. This is something I would want to watch more of. I think the use of props in this particular video, mainly the guitar, really added to the experience and made the video feel very unique, just adding to the entertainment value.  
My only points of confusion were a few smaller choices. The slight opacity on your face-cam is a bit strange, gives me a bit of a ghostly vibe but threw me off a bit at first, only because of some of the empty spots that appear on there. Aside from that though I think this is a solid style to pursue, and I wish you luck in the future as you clearly have lots of potential. Good luck!"
