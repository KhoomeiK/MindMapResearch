Lithium (or was it lamotrigine) also treats Hortons syndrome /cluster headaches. 

And the good old Viagra was meant as heart medicine.

Apart from the last one, I think that when something is wrong in the brains neurotransmitters a lot of symptoms can appear. Then diagnosises are used to categorize the symptoms to focus-in on a treatment that is most likely to work. But there is only so many nuerotransmitters (serotonin, nor-adrenaline, serotonin etc) and a whole range of symptoms that occurres, medicine that correct some neurotransmitters will help on a lot of symptoms.

I'm on lithium and concerta (I think it is called). 

My BP is mostly depressions and I generally have a very low mood without stimulants (before I self-medicated with coffee). The past month I have been very stable with slight hypomania but have felt wonderful. The Hypomania seems to come from the stimulant medicine. Just asked my psych today to give some less strong pills. 

ADHD and BP is very related illnesses. My psych tells me that 30-40% of BP patients also suffers from ADHD. 

I can't remember why we talked about ADHD though. He mentioned it at a session and some days after I found my self watching videos about ADHD in 2x speed. I paused, called him and said 'we need to talk'.. next session he handed me a ADHD-test and was stunned that this amount of ADHD wasn't discovered before (I'm 30).  

I would say that medication for ADHD have truly made me more productive and it is much easier to focus on tasks that I am not very interested in. So if there is a chance you might have it, try some stimulants. But watch out for Hypomania. There is also non stimulant medicine for ADHD.

I Don't have that much to say but:

If it is depression atm, I would say, do small kind guestures that make her life just a little easier. Don't ask too many questions and let her know if she wants to talk you will be there and of course everything she says stay with you. Be aware that if she is very depressed and decides to talk, you will probably hear some very scary thoughts of hers. 

Also respect her boundaries. It is terribly difficult to 'to say no' when depressed so you could easily bother her with you good intensions. 

On the other hand if she is hypo, I really don't know what to say as, for me, this is just being increadibly active on tasks that might not be that productive. But at least I'm happy in the moment.

bipolar2,fomksot,t3_g887mf,1587893766.0,"Tldr. As you, I spend 15 years managing my symptoms w/o meds. This lead to underachieving and fighting battles that could have been avoided. Don't know if meds help yet, but nowing what I know today I would probably have taken the chance with meds.

I knew kind of early in my life that I was bipolar(somewhere in high school). Or Manic-depressive as it was call in my country untill quite recently (Have BP2 officially today). 

The stigma and everybody talking about antidepressants would fuck up your brain and how you would become addicted and what else nonsense people would say (but mostly the stigma) have kept me from getting a real diagnosis/treatment untill a year ago where my life collapsed on it self for reasons I couldn't control (age 29).

Up untill then my life was controllable. I raw dogged all the symptoms but did what I was supposed to: University, jobs etc. though, I always felt I was underachieving by a huge amount - my grades ranging from barely passed to A+ (mostly the former). And in periods I simply went straight to bed after work/lectures.

Then the life implosion last year dropped me at the bottom of the deepest depression in my life and I ended up literally crying on the phone with my insurance company saying I might not feel that well. 

Things went very slowly and I started lithium a month ago. (Long intro sorry). 

So, I completely understand how it is to actively trying to manage this disorder. I applaud you for being that brave and strong-willed. It is so incredibly tough what you are doing and you really have my respect. I will not try to change your mind but add the following:

What I have experienced for the last 15 years is:
- Underachieving due to symptoms
- Much energy spend managing symptoms
- Relationships and friendships broken because of symptoms
*Left the girl I thought was ""meant for me"" because of a hypomanic episode
*Depression have isolated my from social events.
- a lot of unnecessary time in bed

What I'm saying is. It has been complete manageable, and on the surface I'm a very successful engineer but it have lead to alot of unnecessary suffering and wasted energy and time. 

As I just started meds, I can't say any of this could have been avoided but first clue came this week when a rejection for a job I really wanted didn't send me spiraling as it normally would. I would probably recommend 15 yo me to at least try meds."

A diagnosis boils down to what drugs might help you. And the symptoms you describe seems to be manageable with mood stabilizers. Thus, to justify prescribing you mood stabilizers you also need the brain label 'bipolar'.  Hope that makes sense?

CRISPR,foex3pq,t3_g6utym,1587717852.0,"Can I say something here? 

I'm no expert but my ex girlfriend was doing stem cell research specifically to cure type 1 diabetes (which I guess is also genetic). 

This technique among others seems to be exactly her labs take on how to cure it. They had insulin producing beta cells and have had that for many years. 

First problem is that the stem cells used might technically be stem cells but growing the cells and storing them caused mutations that was very hard to control. The mutated cells would multiply and now you basically had a dish of stem-cell-looking cancer you could make into beta cells with out knowing that they where not pure stemcells anymore. 

Other problem was the body of a diabetic person sees the beta cells as foreign and attack them. A way to stop this immune response is non exiting. 

""These animals were rendered diabetic by a toxin injection (streptozotocin), which destroys the endogenous beta cells.""

Hence no account for the body attacking the beta cells.

Lastly, it is very difficult to have the beta cells react to glucose levels in the body. One thing is having them produce insulin but also having them do it at the right time.

Maybe they overcame these issues idk. 

Complete unrelated to my comment. Check out Viacytes approach of incapsulating the cells, if diabetes and CRISPR is just your thing. The insulin can flow out and the randomly mutated cells don't enter other parts of the body and can't be attacked by the immune system."

Of course you know what feels best for you. I proposed a partner as i, myself, started in a running club and that gave me a huge boost and felt obligated to go. 

We all know in this forum how difficult anything can feel when fighting depression so you doing anything towards your goals is just amazing and a big reason to be proud. Remember small steps and be proud! Because you are good! I will be in the online side line cheering on you!"
bipolar2,fnta3c4,t3_g3s135,1587237554.0,"For eating I usually ""just"" don't buy unhealthy stuff like candy or snack. When asked why I answer 'because I eat it'. So if it isn't there no calories. 
My go-to for healthy food are very simple salads with nice dressings (blah blah high calories but changing from pizza to salad is always better) and then just use enough so it's tasty. Buying fresh vegetables and slicing them on a julliene slicer is actually fast and easy. Or you can buy a salad. Start by doing it once a week and make it bearable! And remember lots of compliments to your self for taking care if yourself and following your goals. And here your goal is to eat healthy and exercise NOT lose weight. It's a lifestyle change not a copetition. 

For exercise: set up mental a reward. Watching your favorite show, a hot shower with some smelly stuff, idk, whatever would make you feel good that isn't food.  Secondly put in your calender 1 max 2 times a week a specific time to work out for 5 minutes, no more. When your brain makes you feel depressed 5 minutes of working is a freaking lifetime. Find on YouTube exercises for overweight people / newbies, so you don't end up with an exercise you cannot do. After 5 minutes of work out compliment your self and be proud of you taking control and following your goals. You have earned your reward! Now ask yourself if the reward can be delayed just 5 minutes so you can exercise a little more. After all you do have your yoga pants on. If yes take 5 mins more and be double proud. If not, go do the reward! It's completely okay because you worked for it. When this turns to a habit you can increase the time you train and the frequency. 

Also, if you BF or a friend can get involved in a way, so it could be something you do together. So days where you feel really down you have a partner to rely on. 

That's the best I can do. Good luck."

The diagnosis doesn't matter as long as the meds work. It seems like you have tried meds for unipolar depression but with out complete success so maybe give the new meds some time?"
bipolar2,fnj7y1u,t1_fniqz1k,1586993677.0,"Sounds like me on my high days. Though your duration is a little shorter in the cycles. Have you researched cyclothymia? It is a rapid cycling version of rapid cycling bipolar more or less. As far as I have understood it also ranks as being less severe than bipolar in general (higher lows and lower highs) also, 30% of all with bipolar also suffers from ADHD. Some of what you describe could sound like stemming from that. I have always questioned if I just suffer from ADHD with depressive periods. 

You don't have to have all symptoms to be classified as bipolar so lacking some symptoms is just nice. What a diagnosis boils down to is just the medication. Giving SSRI antidepressants to a bipolar will likely trigger hypomania. That would be why your doctor would start with bipolar meds as those also work for depression. 

Hope you figure it out. I'm not a doctor in anyway so don't believe too much od what I just wrote. It is what I have learned my self, researching my own diagnosis."

My psych explained to me that being bipolar is having symptoms of depression and mania at the same time, always. That's the decease. Though sometimes some symptoms for depression show more and other times it is the mania that is most prominent. When something emotionally stressful happens all symptoms flair up.

I have never lost a close relative like you. But have been through peroids with great grief and my feelings were just as you explained. All over the place."

Nice art btw."
bipolar,fmrxk10,t1_fmqyjdz,1586339189.0,"Don't feel guilty (Sorry for telling you what to do). Remember that psychiatric illnesses are unique from person to person. It is not like physical illness where e.g. diabetes always have the same symptoms and treatment. There is a huge overlap in illnesses stemming from problems with neurotransmitters and diagnosis is given if a collection of symptoms mostly indicates one illness. Just reading in this sub should give you a quite good understanding that not even bipolar patient have equal symptoms. So, feeling guilty doesn't help as it is the science behind diagnosis of psychiatric patients that is insufficient for now. 

I will also have to agree with you psych (again, I am not a doctor) as normal working brains does not go into hypomania from SSRI meds which indicates bipolar.

I'm sorry to hear that lamotrigine did not work out for you that is usually a very good drug. I started on it but got a terrible rash all over my body so changed to lithium (cheap, unbranded and well documented) some studies have shown that lithium also works for BPD maybe suggest that?

That was long again. sorry. Good luck with finding the right meds and handling or illness."
bipolar,fmqvfjk,t3_fwu4e2,1586307914.0,"I know nothing and am not educated in any way to answer this. So following is only based on my own internet research.

I have had the same thoughts as you and therefore I have looked into it a bit. So, BDP seems to be caused by problems with nuerotransmitters in the brain which is primarily serotonin. Funny enough too little serotonin and you get depressed and using SSRI (serotonin reuptake inhibitors) to boost serotonin levels for bipolar patients will have them spiraling into mania. Thus, bipolar patients also seem to suffer from serotonin regulation problems.  In fact a lot of bipolar meds are also used for BPD. For that reason alone I think it is very plausible that both conditions could exist simultaneously. Say your brain is developed with a serotonin regulation problems it could show as bipolar or BPD or a bit of both.

Fun fact: 30% of bipolar patients also suffers from ADHD. This however seems to be more of a dopamine regulation related issue. 

Anyway, maybe you could ask for drugs that help both issues? Lamotrigine seems to be a very effective drug against both illnesses (according to drugs.com reviews)"
