depression,eohvv8e,t3_brffm6,1558598770.0,"In my experience I’ve been depressed all four years of my high school. I was open about it to my teachers that I was depressed and whatnot and they were nice and understanding, but they didn’t really do anything .Then the beginning of my senior year another student had committed suicide. Then out of the blue teachers started talking to me and would ask how I was and suddenly seemed to give a shit. I understand they are busy and can’t spend time individually thanks to the fucked up school system: but now they can just come out and act concerned for me after 3 years of previously really not caring too much about it. Maybe if it wasn’t this way, that poor kid wouldn’t have committed suicide."
