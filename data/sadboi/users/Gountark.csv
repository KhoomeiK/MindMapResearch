Gabapentin or pregabalin would help a bit more for a rapid taper. If you're not gone tested, there's other option on clear net to make your tapler slower if your doc is rigid about having a slower taper schedule. but I won't name them here.

Alsol theanine do help a bit and magnesium at night.... also kava can help.. but alcool is treateous, it help while drunk but make the wd way more intense after.

BipolarReddit,fi3233u,t1_fi317r0,1582097436.0,"No need to fully accept it. Fuck any of those barrier that often come with a fully accepted diagnostic. Your someone with an history, not a disease on leg."
bipolar,fi31w01,t3_f66v1k,1582097196.0,"Please avoid blaming any violent, abusive behavior and all the character bad choice on bd. Try to avoid any stigmatization or don't try to write about the official bipolar person. That doesn't mean your character will not make at least a few shit show and some destructive behavior. It's also kind of dealing with this disorder in life. Create a rich background, a specific personnal story that explain more wisely the character bad or good move than only having a bipolar diagnostic. Treat it as any character with his own motive, flaws and aspirations. Try to not over romantize mania or hypomania, include the suffering, the crazy tought process and the near or future devastation (chaos and guilt). Dont forget that depression is often long and always  boring. I even suggest you try to make it boring to read. So the reader can feel the emptiness. And do not forget about all the physicall side of an episode: from lacking concentration, to back pain and too much agitation. Hope it help."
BipolarReddit,fi2z7sr,t3_f65e1h,1582094104.0,"10 years of denial after my first bd diagnostic. 2 confirmation by other psychiatrist later, many episode after, I still sometime think, I'm an impostor. It's in your head... yes, It's a mental health disorder."
bipolar,fi2ryzq,t3_f60so9,1582087382.0,"Up your dose for at least a week, like a half pill and a quarter. You can still do what would I call a rapid taper with this one, compare to many meds who need to be drop slower. After drop to an half for 2 weeks and  to a quarter for a week. You shouldn't experience bad wd this way. Doc often underestimate wd, better talk with your pharmacist. 

Drink a lot of water, eat plenty of veggie and fruit, Magnesium at night help, in the day L theanine is also a helping. There's many other thing depending what are your wd symptoms.

Guns might be more present in the beggining to   protect the community and to preserve it from reactionnary force. I still don't know how to manage this issue. I'm also having the same question  Suicide and mass murder are terrible event. Easy access to guns help those events to happen, but without guns it will be hard to fight counter revolution.

bipolar,fhwkure,t3_f525cw,1581919118.0,"I'm a dad, in canada too. I've been admitted only a short time with my free will since I'm a dad. (In the past is another  story). My wife also a month, she's not bipolar but was depressed and highly suicidal. They don't restrain any access with our daughter. Even when the other parent in charge, me, was known as bipolar. Your partner will back you up. Everybody get sick somedays and the other parent need to be in charge of the kids. You wouldn't have ask yourself  this if it was for any physical desease. If you need help, you need it, be honest, don't think twice.

Actually, it can be a good thing to be inpatient for a while. Especially if it's from a free will. It can help to adjust your med quickly. You will have a break, time to sleep a lot, no needs to make food or any house core.  Depending where you live, there's also crisis center wich are nicer place, more freedom and visit than hospital and they can help you to get through this. Courage"
BipolarReddit,fhwixpo,t3_f4ye9e,1581917269.0," Totaly understand your choice but...

Don't quit them cold turkey! It will put your brain at too much stress, unless you've been only a short time on them, like 2-3 weeks max. Wd from psych med can create news symptoms ( like I know someone who start to hear voice from quitting a strong dose of seroquel cold turkey).Or it can exacerbate what you were treating before. You really need to taper. Depending on the med, the dosage, the time you've been on it and if you take a combo: your taper schedule will change. The safest approach in medication self management  is a 10% or 1/8 reduction by week, even by 2 weeks. Go to the previous  dose if feeling bad symptoms. It take time but it's safe. Some meds can be cut. Some med can be crush and than you weight them, so it's easier to taper slowly. Others not, so you need to get the lower mg by pill and it will imply telling your pharmacist about your plan to stop. In conclusion, it's always better to talk about quitting med with your psychiatrist. If he or she doesn't cooperate, than do it safely on your own. Taper!
