One day you wake up and you can see, if only a little, and you catch a glimpse of the ladder and walk towards it. You're about to grasp the first rung but the lights vanish again and your hand only touches the wall. You start to feel your energy being sapped and your will is going, but you know the ladder was there and you search for a minute or two, soon realizing that it's gone again. You go back to your corner of the hole and sleep, because thst's all you have the energy to do. For the next few days...or it could be weeks...or even months -you aren't quite sure- you lie there in the darkness, feeling nothing.
