highschool,fr3qpu8,t1_fr1kue5,1589863709.0,Thanks. Have you had any experience with burnouts? I dislike the counselor at my school so I know I'm definitely not going to talk to her. I'm always feeling like I want to study but at the same time my motivation is lacking.
highschool,fr19o6b,t1_fr0gu08,1589815856.0,Yeah but the thing is I've been trying really hard in middle school. Looking back on it I regret it because it wasn't worth all those late nights. Now I'm just afraid I'll be burnt out. I know a lot of high schoolers had excellent grades in middle school only to lack in high school because they're so tired. I'm afraid I'm reaching that period.

Side with the humans, who are already quite overpowered by the androids, and could possibly lose their only advantage over them (the control of the androids) or the androids who just want the same equal rights as other humans, even if they don't bleed the same? There is also well known moral choices like whether you get to kill somebody etc. It's honestly one of my favorite games and it's entertaining but thought provoking at the same time."
