Okay, your point in that ""Women should just say something"". Is not a counterpoint to ""Women are just expected to be in pain and deal with it during their first time, due to the patriarchy.""

Ops claim is saying that something happens and why, your ""counter claim"", doesn't explain either.  

We are not arguing why women are in pain, we are arguing why women are expected to be in pain and put up with it, while women being in pain is an obvious side affect of it. 

So as I said, ""Women should just say something"", directly supports the idea of the patriarchy, because without it, women *would be inclined to say something*.

It is historically because of men who have for years completely pushed down and shamed Women sexuality that we have this issue. We've gone from an era where women couldn't have sex, to an era where women shouldn't enjoy sex, and to now, where those things are slowly dying off, but little parts of them aren't. The ""Women are always in pain when they first have sex"" line is one of these parts, again created by men/the patriarchy to control women and make their own pleasure more important over women, because they would rather do it their way than take out time and do foreplay or make sure their partner isnt pain. It hasn't gone away, it's a historically the patriarchies fault, and we shouldn't have a society that assumes women should be in pain their first time, we should have a society that tells women they shouldn't be in pain to begin with, and that it's perfectly fine to speak up."

Just using the term psychopath makes me want to listen less.

>Just because the dog doesn’t know what upset his owner doesn’t mean he isn’t remorseful at having upset him.

Okay then the two things are seperate. The dog feels guilty for doing a wrong action so he puts his tail down because he knows he's about to get in trouble and get yelled at, that's guilt. Then after although he doesn't know what he did wrong, he didn't like upsetting his owner (because he didn't like being in trouble) that's remorsful-ish .

Edit: oh yea and he did the same thing after his last kill, which was his mom, where he said that ""the need was just gone""

Oh and if any of you are wondering, yes people with aspd (sociopaths) can feel guilt, they just don't feel remorseful. If I understand correctly it's like if you have a dog, and it breaks into your cabinet and eats your food. When you yell at it, it'll put its tail between its legs whatever, because it knows what it did was bad and that it's in trouble, but it won't feel remorse because it has no idea *why* what it did was wrong.
