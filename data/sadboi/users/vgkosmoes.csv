My beginning months existed mainly out of scales, scales and scales obviously to work on intonation. I still try to play them for atleast an hour a day.

The next thing you should focus on is learning how to use the full bow, getting comfortable with slurring and just getting a good sound overall. I also watched tons and tons of videos/masterclasses on the violin to help me out and keep me motivated. Make sure your posture is correct and that there is no tension anywhere, have a loose wrist, etc.. 

Best of luck!"
