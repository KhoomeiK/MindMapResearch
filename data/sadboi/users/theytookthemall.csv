AskHistorians,fhfzmzi,t3_f28xuu,1581555121.0,"Probably. There's no such thing as The Common Cold: today there's four most common viruses that cause cold-like disease, each of which has multiple subtypes, and a bunch of less-common causes of cold-like symptoms([1](https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749\(95\)70218-0/fulltext#EPIDEMIOLOGY%20AND%20ETIOLOGY)). We only identified rhinovirus, which is the most common cause of colds, in the 1950s. Coronaviruses (yes, the same type of virus currently involved in the epidemic in China) were identified later than that. 

Unlike the flu, which tends to change every year, there's little evidence of rhinoviruses replacing themselves with ""better"" versions([2](https://jvi.asm.org/content/91/7/e01659-16)). There are many variations, but they tend to remain as such. I don't know of any evidence that any particular serotype of rhinovirus was around [i]x[/i] number of years ago. 

With that said, there's significant evidence that people routinely experienced the same set of symptoms we would consider a cold as far back as we have recordings about medicine. The Ebers Papyrus, which was written in Egypt probably before the 16th century BCE, describes ways of dealing with all sorts of medical ailments, including a cough and a runny nose. 

As for the Greeks, they absolutely had colds. Galen, who lived about 200 years BCE, identified a runny/stuffy nose as basically a waste product and not an indicator of serious illness (or, as he would have framed it, a serious imbalance of the four humors). He, and his predecessor Hippocrates (of the Hippocratic Oath), both identified seasonal variations in illnesses, and identified cold-like symptoms as more common in the winter. 

Much of the above is summarized from ""A short history of the common cold"" by Isabel Atzl and Roland Helms, the first chapter of a book called ""The Common Cold"". Almost all of the first chapter is available [here](https://books.google.com/books?id=rRIdiGE42IEC&lpg=PA3&pg=PR3#v=onepage&q=steam&f=false)."

I won't go through the very long list of effects but basically, if you go over the exposure limit you're going to have a very bad time and very possibly die. If you can detect the ammonia-like odor, you're almost certainly over the safe exposure like. 

NTO is arguably not as horrible, but a NASA mission in 1975 had an error where NTO fumes got into the capsule cabin on descent, resulting in one crew member passing out and all the of them being hospitalized with chemically-induced pneumonia after touchdown.

AskReddit,f5tspst,t3_dp56ya,1572463778.0,"There were two.

Mrs Chanowicz understood that 7th grade was not going well for me - and a couple other kids. We were allowed to spend lunch in her classroom. The only rules were we had to be quiet, and we had to be nice to each other. I ate lunch in her room maybe 170 days out of 180. I read *dozens* of books from her library. After each one, she'd ask if I liked it or not, and why. That's what taught me how to talk about writing style and pacing and voice and all sorts of things.

The second was Sra. Casiano, for Spanish 9-12th grade and she was amazing. She was a legitimately great teacher who learned exactly how to manipulate me into actually studying and learning. 

I once, my senior year, confided to her that I felt like no matter what I would always be under the shadow of my very smart and very successful older sister. I'd just started college applications I was terrified that the conditional acceptance to one overseas school was the best I'd get, I wouldn't get the exams I needed for it, and that I was basically a total failure with no redeeming qualities.

The next day, she sent me out of class under the pretense of bringing a note to the front office. When I got back to class, she has set up a party, complete with a cake, snacks, and decorations. On the board she'd written in huge letters, For Theytookthemall, Because She Deserves It. She told everyone I'd gotten a conditional acceptance to one of my top-choice schools. It turned out everyone in our IB class was incredibly stressed, and we spent that class period just venting about college applications. Throughout the rest of the year we'd all update her as we heard back from colleges, and we'd have a little celebration for each success.

It was pretty much the first time I'd ever been individually celebrated, certainly at school, and I will never ever forget how incredible it felt. She saw me. She saw my hard work, she saw my anxieties, and despite what 17-year-old me thought, she saw something worth celebrating in that. It was an incredible act of empathy and compassion - she knew exactly what I needed and went completely all-out for it. That was 15 years ago, and I still get emotional thinking about it."
