I have been fucking robbed of everything i love and my own self bc my stupid brain has worked against me for the last 10 years. I’ve tried to kill myself so many times. I ruined my future in high school.  Y’all 17 and 19 year olds think your life sucking sucks because nobody loves you and you’re ugly? There’s so many worse things out there that won’t matter in the next 10 years. I stopped even participating in this sub. It’s infuriating.

However, i just got put on the right medication and dosage about 2 weeks ago and saw improvements last week. It feels like my real self. Like after digging for so long i finally got to who i should have been all along. Makes me wonder how far ahead i would be if i had been put on meds sooner. Turns out i love exercise and being active. Turns out I am great at tidying up and I enjoy cooking A LOT.  I might unsubscribe all together.  If you are really depressed i’d say get on meds. Seek help. nobody gives a shit that you’re sad. we’re all sad. help yourself bc nobody is going to come along and do it for you.
