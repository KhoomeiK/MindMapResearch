First of all, i've heard that the virus can live on surfaces for hours to days. 3-7 Days? I think it depends on the type of material so I will have to look that up...

But here is my thought process on how this works...(with some questions of my own)

Perhaps these waves actually are re-infections but on a scale that makes it seem as if it is not? Bear with me here... The key to getting rid of a virus is to decrease it's numbers right? .. (Does covid19 multiply at an accelerated rate? genuinely curious about that)

The less copies of the virus, the easier it is for your body to fight it off... but if covid19 does have a high rate of infection and replication .. (Does the virus replicates at an accelerated rate when it first enters the body?) Then, it seems imply that you could potentially spread the virus on something while you are at your sickest and as your body is fighting it off (within the window of survival for the virus on surfaces) maybe even on your way to recovery but come in contact with something where the virus landed (even many things like blankets or pillows etc.) and then you are ""infected"" again. Your immune system is overwhelmed and then your body is already weakened so you get more sick.

I'm just brainstorming here. A patient with covid19 might not even realize realize they are coming in contact with something that they hadn't sanitized.. something the virus had managed to get on earlier (Through particles in the air even?) .. meaning that the body may be seriously fighting the virus but the virus is all over anything that this person may have contacted constantly supplying more of the virus...I imagine that would make it very hard for the body to fight off..

There would be times where the body does manage to finally start to beat it and then the numbers of the virus suddenly surge again. I mean its a literally battle going on inside there!! I have to wonder what the viruses ""game plan"" is so to speak. Perhaps its both re-infection and that it comes in waves.

Of course, seeing more scientific information on what they know about it so far would help, I might have to go down that rabbit hole because I am curious what they are letting the public know right now about it.

I'm not an expert on this topic, I am just curious and think about these things a lot. LOL I may be way way wrong here and just talking out my ass. I'll have to add some edits if I find anything interesting to share.

That will show her just how serious you are about not wanting to abuse it anymore.. She should be considerate of this and actually appreciate you coming to her about it.. Think about it, alcoholics don't go to bars or keep alcohol in their house if they know they can't control themselves right? Whats the difference?"
Drugs,fqgu9hs,t3_ggzkw9,1589357339.0,"People have written books about addiction and recovery.. so theres a LOT to learn and understand and experience... but I'll try to give you some of the biggest pointers. 

A good place to start might be to look online for more support and recovery oriented forums.. find some people there who's experiences you can read and and learn from.. maybe even share some of your own.. Then if you're really serious about it.. Maybe even attend a group session in RL (Not sure if thats still happening during COVID but they might do them online now)... You will need some support. (Maybe even a trusted friend you can talk to)

In order to stop you're going to have to eliminate the drug from your life.. that means not getting more, getting rid of what you have and if someone you know has them, or someone you live with has them and you can't trust yourself not to try to get some, be honest and let them know... It's like having an issue with alcohol.. Some alcoholics wont go to bars or allow alcohol in their homes because they know they will be tempted by it.. This may be something you have to fight to avoid forever.. it may be something you get over and move past quickly.

You have to get serious and you have to want to quit. You have to make the choice to start and start finding every resource and tool you can to help you along the way. Like I said, you will also benefit from having some kind of support.. even if its just the support of a small group online.. or a close friend. As long as you have some support.. that will better your chances of overcoming this. 

and then you have to realize that you're going to make mistakes.. sure some poeple don't and quit these things cold turkey.. good for them, thats awesome.. but if you slip up, don't use that as an excuse to keep going.. You just regroup and recenter and start again. 

Start thinking about the effects adderall abuse can have on you long term. Start looking that kind of stuff up.. you might not even realize just how seriously damaging it can be to heavily abuse adderall. I'm not saying you're fucked forever, that kind of thinking will only lead you to relapse... The sooner you beat the addiction, the less negative long term effects you will have.. and maybe even none.. but the reality is, the longer you do this, the higher those odds go up. You don't want to drop dead from a heart attack or fuck up your Dopamine receptors so much that you can't be happy anymore...

and lastly, be prepared to feel like shit. be prepared to crave it.. but those things are very temporary and if they are not then you should reach out to a specialist who can help you in the case that you become depressed. Luckily, adderall withdraw isn't nearly as gnarly as say opiate or benzo withdraw.. you'll mostly feel like shit for a few days... but your body will begin to recover if you take care of yourself, sleep eat and don't run back to the adderall, desperate to feel better... no matter how shitty you feel.. Just tough it out and you'll be fine. 

Don't give up, you got this.. This is temporary.."
addiction,fqgsfn2,t3_gcj0vy,1589355615.0,"Adderall is a powerful and addictive drug and might as well be pharmaceutical meth. However, when used correctly, on someone who needs it.. It can be just as powerful but more beneficial. I have ADD and depression.. I have used adderall here and there but can't get a script for it.. It's crazy hard to get one and IDK why. Some people get them easy no problem, other people (like me) immediately get the ""We don't prescribe that here"" or ""There are better options"" or ""Depression can have the same symptoms of ADD Lets treat the depression first"" etc.... Not to mention, they usually want you to go through the entire list of ""Safer alternatives"" before giving you full out Adderall. (Again, depends on the person/doctor.. some people get stuff handed to them and Idk how)

I have tried wellbutrin and it made me super irritable and gave me headaches.. I tried Starttera (Still taking it) and it does WONDERS for my depression and slightly helps my ADD... They have refused to prescribe anything else. Who knows, maybe thats a good thing for me? See, I'd love to get a script for Adderall.. It helps me SO much.. (Best when I don't try to take more than I should) but I also have abused it in the past and I worry about that temptation should I suddenly have 30 of them at once.

Thats the issue with addiction.... even if you are taking a prescribed drug that you actually need, there is still a potential for abuse.. Not only that, but if you're addicted to stimulants (or have had an issue with them) Idk if having someone hold on to the pills would stop you.. I mean, when you know the pills are there... somewhere in that persons possession... So close and yet forbidden, the temptation to go searching for them and sneak one here and there might be intense. OR to even get to a point where you're like.. if I just tell them I can take them responsibly then I can have control over them myself and then no one will know. OR to skip taking a pill here and there in order to save up and take higher doses later... You have to think from the perspective of an addict here.. We would do whatever it takes.

Now, if the person can have self control and realize that it is for their best interest that they take the medicine exactly as prescribed and can have the will power not to go looking for them.. then sure, I think they could probably benefit from having them prescribed... Just don't be fooled.. Just because it is an approved medicine, doesn't mean it is safe or less addicting or less mind altering. I personally have never done meth thank goodness but I have tried coke and unfortunately smoked crack before when I was younger. I really believe adderall is more powerful than cocaine. Not so sure if it's more powerful than crack though.. but not far behind. (Depending on if you swallow or snort it)  Just to give some perspective..

Idk if he has ever tried Strattera, but it worked wonders for me when wellbutrin didn't.. Was it as powerful as Adderall? No, it wasn't... but it helped with the depression and ADD enough that I could start being more productive.. AND it isn't exactly a drug of abuse like Adderall is....

The other option is to see if he can get the Dr to prescribe a version that is less able to be abused.. (But people can still find a way to abuse it.. just to be clear.) For example, Vyvanse... It is processed differently and you can't snort it to get high.. Thats a big plus since snorting can be a major contributor to addiction and further abuse... Vyvanse would defninitely be the safest route.. It's still amphetamines.. it's just a different formulation that needs to be broken down in the liver before it becomes active.. Thats definitely something to consider and probably the best option if he does find a Dr. to prescribe it to him... Much easier to control your self and take as prescribed when it is Vyvanse than Adderall."

AliensAndUFOs,fmcr48r,t1_fmay4k5,1585951153.0,Yeah there’s the humanoid ones and there was the key one. I feel like theirs been an increase in those shaped sightings more so than the usual disk/orb/blinking lights.
AliensAndUFOs,fmar05d,t3_ftn4qk,1585904358.0,"Where are all the comments on posts lately? Also, this looks like the same figure being seen in several other places as well... is there anyone looking into this?"
SimulationTheory,fmaq2o9,t1_fman066,1585903304.0,Idk maybe the goal is to escape? Or to make it through with the right “score” whatever that means.
SimulationTheory,fm99um2,t3_ftmcvv,1585864480.0,"Idk it would make more sense if this was a simulation or some kind of purgatory. Do I want it that way? Not ideally but based on the way the world is? Yeah probably, that would mean there’s a chance that things could be better or different somewhere else."
Empaths,fm8f8er,t3_ftffh7,1585848337.0,"Yeah actually.. I’ve been feeling really drained and overwhelmed and having constant headaches and even neck pain and tightness. I’m really not happy with the state of this world and it scares me like something worse is coming. 

I think everyone is scared and angry right now and it’s making us empathy sick with it all."
Drugs,fm74m4b,t1_fm72r87,1585813066.0,"Once again, the plant gets selectively bred to be more and more potent and people have more unpredictable reactions to it. Which is still along the lines of my thought process. Leave it alone and it’s fine. 

As for synthetic drugs, sure I can understand from a scientific perspective that it’s easier to control an isolated chemical but what about the other parts of the plant that contribute to its effects? Using weed as an example again, there’s different types of cbd and thc, terpenes and alkaloids in plants that get eliminated when isolating chemicals. That can lead to a lesser therapeutic effect when all parts of the plant could be more effective and productive when working in synergy together. 

I don’t really have the energy to go into the breakdowns of every chemical and drug and plant or fungus etc and how fucking with their chemistry can lead to less desire able effects but my point was basically if you leave shit alone it’s usually better off in its purest form."
Drugs,fm6higw,t3_ft6dko,1585794179.0,"Actually, the problem begins when you take something from it’s natural state and fuck with it to extract certain properties or to create the drug like happens with pretty much every drug except for shrooms and weed. Of course, you can be addicted to anything and some things have naturally occurring addictive properties (aka: nicotine and opium) however the original natural product untucked with is usually less harmful than the product people create from it. Example: coco leaves being chewed still provides a stimulating effect but the user gets much lower dosages and the effects come up slowly over time as opposed to cocaine powder or injection which results in an immediate and intense high that can provide many more toxic effects. 

Again, like I said, it is true you can be addicted to any thing and even that many things are addictive even in their natural forms. However, there is *some* truth that drugs in their natural form can less dangerous or less addicting. 

When speaking specifically about weed and mushrooms they are certainly the less dangerous drugs comparatively... though it has been noted since the legalization in many areas of marijuana, people who use more concentrated forms or higher concentrated dosages often experience more unpleasant effects that could even be considered an overdose... (Vomiting first example) 

I know I might get shit for saying this, but I just wanted to give a more educated response to the issue of a natural drug being less “dangerous” than just a dumbfounded look when someone says what about opium or cocoa leaves. Unfortunately some people say that stuff without really having any proof other than “natural” is better.. which isn’t *always* true... but it can be."
depression,fm4tupp,t3_fsrdy5,1585760699.0,"I feel like... I don’t want to die, but I don’t want to live like this. I think it’s the society we live in. This is not a proper life... people need to feel they have some kind of purpose... that their life has meaning. Living in a corporate society your life is meaningless, you can easily be replaced and if you can’t fight your way to the top you can suffer at the bottom supporting everyone else’s weight above you. It’s more dystopian than we realize and I really believe it’s a society problem, not an us problem. 

Most people like us probably have a whole ton more to give the world but we are unable to give it and so we feel unfulfilled, useless, apathetic and hopeless. 

That being said, I try to hold on to the idea that we are so very precious. Even if society says we are replaceable or weak or insufficient... it’s not true. We have so much to offer... we just have to find a way to believe in that and find different ways to contribute or ways to find peace with ourselves even if we cannot. 

It’s not easy and I don’t claim to have mastered this... I’ve been feeling quite depressed lately so I totally get this... I just know that for every dip into depression I endure, there will be a lifting out to enjoy the sunshine for a bit... even if for a little bit.. everything is temporary and this will pass... there will be sunshine and rain... We just have to hang in there till the next reprieve. I live for those good times, for the light in the darkness, for the breaths of fresh air and taste of comfort and peace... no matter how temporary, it makes life worth living and the darkness is temporary too."
BDSMAdvice,fm4rtxz,t3_fstys6,1585759643.0,In addition to consensual non consent... it could also be considered predator/prey... maybe see if you could get him to be interested in a more “primal” play where he plays the more aggressive male and you’re the resistant female who he’s gotta capture to mate with.

OpenChristian,flvlh3o,t3_fr8z3b,1585526430.0,"Replace Fear with Awe. Imagine fear meaning that you are in awe of something’s power. It’s not to fear God as if he has it out for all of us, but to be in awe of his power enough to understand his position. We should fear losing connection with God as God is the source of life and all things."
