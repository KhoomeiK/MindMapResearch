I have a good job - which I’m grateful for - but lately I find myself complaining and ranting about it. Don’t feel respected or heard. Talked down to constantly.

I have people that love me - and perhaps some that respect me- I do - but they are so far away - and I feel like my trauma hurts them/would shock them, so I do a little dance and show for them, to make them feel better.

“I’m fine. I’m fine. Better than fine.”

Those lies of omission, to myself and others, and that fact that I can only speak up for myself when I get to an enraged level... which continues the stupid cycle of chaos. Inward chaos, I guess, that seeps out into my world.

Remember the first time you tried to do something as a kid.. like.. learn to walk.. read? Or ride a bike? 

I'm willing to bet that you took some time until the training wheels were off, you probably fell over a few times, maybe popped a tire aggravatingly far from home, got it stolen because you forgot the lock, nearly got hit by a car a few times, got your pant leg stuck in the oily chain, forgot how to brake, maybe went over the handle bars, and wrecked. 

Did you never ride a bike again? 
Did you fall once and never try walking again? 
Did you quit trying to learn those letters? Obviously not since you posted here!

Well this thing is like that. You have to *learn* how to do this. 
There are going to be false starts, but each start is a measure of success.

So glad to have posted and so grateful for all the support."

I really stopped drinking to help manage this illness- which has helped so much with anxiety. I haven’t had much of an urge to drink in months, but yesterday was just a dumptruck of BS.

Just need to shut off my brain somehow. 

I appreciate your help. I’m better today.. just at a low boil."

She is coping by drinking alcohol and shuts down and just cooks which is her stress relief.
I can't ask her to quit : I wish she wouldn't drink, but that's just how it is.

I'll talk to her today about the masks. 
For some reason, that was the straw that broke the camels back for this camel.

I love her - and she likely had no idea how much her blowing off my efforts affected me at that moment."
