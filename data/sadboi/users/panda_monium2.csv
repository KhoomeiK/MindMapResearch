In the end if you want to buy a house have enough for down payment, closing costs, and emergency money.  Ensure you can afford the monthly cost.  Finally get a good inspection!  You can talk with a broker who can give you a better idea of what your monthly costs/closing costs would look like.

Also side note be sure you are filing local taxes if necessary.  A lot of PA cities require a local tax on where your work or live but your work might not take them out since it’s in NJ.

If you will be eligible based on 2020 income and didn’t receive a check  you should see a tax credit when you file in 2021."
personalfinance,flofme0,t1_flob77z,1585337370.0,I would file ASAP
CoronaBumpers,flnj7d9,t1_flnh8j4,1585319733.0,Yeah luckily my OB has been taking this virus seriously from the beginning.  She’s actually pretty chill so when she was like no stay home this is a big deal... it definitely kicked my husband and myself into gear.  I’ll be honest in Feb I was on the “it’s just a flu brigade”.... boy was I wrong.
CoronaBumpers,flnfudl,t1_flnexsd,1585317667.0,"I feel for the first trimester ladies since I know I didn’t announce to work till 12 weeks.  First trimester was tough without all this craziness.

I’m due in late June so idk if I’m more concerned about getting it while pregnant, giving birth during the crisis, or having a newborn with this stuff all around.  

I agree though everyone should be avoiding it but I just can’t believe some people still don’t view pregnant women in the same category as the vulnerable groups."
CoronaBumpers,flnaais,t1_fln3lr4,1585313810.0,"Ugh I’m sorry that’s a tough call.  I get both sides of it.  

Money is important but so is staying safe.  I’m sorry that you have to make such a difficult decision."
CoronaBumpers,fln9qn4,t3_fpug9z,1585313388.0,"Sorry I’m about to rant but this drives me nuts with the “pregnant women are not increased risk”. 

We are told we can’t take 99% of medication because there is no info or maybe possible could be a risk...or we can’t eat certain food because there is a .01% of getting listeria based on 12/100000 in the USA.  

However a novel virus comes along and there is no info and all of a sudden we are no longer at increased risk.  People are using a study of <100 women to justify that there is no risk and pregnant women should continue working as normal regardless if it’s essential or not....I just don’t get it.  

Sorry off my soap box... ending rant"
personalfinance,flkd4ib,t1_flk7dlk,1585238663.0,"To my knowledge you usually dispute with the credit agencies (experian, transunion, and equifax)."
personalfinance,fljyfek,t1_fljtdrp,1585229875.0,"Not to my knowledge.  You can “revise it” after it’s accepted but you can’t unfile.

Are you going to be over the limit in 2020?  If not, you’ll get the money when you file your 2020 taxes.  Obviously Not ideal if you need it now.

Disclaimer: This is assuming the bill stays as written

Edit: it appears that there is nothing explicitly written requiring you to pay back any overages... so we will see"
CoronaBumpers,flgy2sa,t1_flgshy2,1585152514.0,Yeah I’m with ya on that.  Just one more thing to add!
CoronaBumpers,flgr3a9,t1_flgofz0,1585148649.0,Yeah a lot of parts come from China and then assembled in the US.  A lot of states are closing furniture/textile manufacturer since it’s deemed non essential.  I’m assuming that’s probably why there might be shortage.
CoronaBumpers,flgle7v,t3_fod74h,1585145294.0,"Yeah I’m noticing some of my registry items are either “sold out” or “no longer available”.  Might start buying the necessary excluding the disposable/constant need items (eg diapers, wipes, formula)"
personalfinance,flf3lkm,t1_flewfl8,1585097293.0,"You lose the money.  Some employers have a grace period but it’s a use it or lose it type of deal.

Maybe in the fall take a look to see what are considered eligible expenses if you can’t use them in the summer."
personalfinance,flf2i9s,t1_flddfvn,1585096596.0,"Do you have short term through your employer?  This should be listed in a benefits package.  If you don’t then there is nothing to apply for unless you have insurance on your own.  If you do, then you go through their disability insurance provider so would contact them.

For instance Lincoln financial is our disability insurance provider for my company so I would apply through them and contact them for guidance."
personalfinance,flf1yid,t1_flevxp6,1585096245.0,"Can second this.  Cost me 1200 dollars/month to do COBRA for two adults while I waited for my next employers insurance to kick in (30 day waiting period) 

Maybe there is something in Obamacare?  I believe loss of benefits qualify as a life changing event."
personalfinance,flf1rz8,t1_fldu2zy,1585096132.0,"If she’s getting paid and is employed then I doubt she’ll qualify for unemployment.  If she quits, then most states will not approve her for unemployment.  It’s usually reserved for those who are laid off.  You’ll have to check with your state rules though."
personalfinance,flf0yw6,t1_fley66j,1585095620.0,"I would do the reduced hours assuming you are okay with working during the pandemic.  Would not rely on a “proposed bill” as income.  Plus there are benefits to take into consideration.  Just my thoughts.

In some states if your hours are reduced you can apply for unemployment.  You will have to see if you would qualify.

Unemployment offices are pretty overwhelmed so it may take a bit to get to your application which can always be denied."
vanderpumprules,flepxvy,t1_flebz5y,1585089165.0,Luke... so hot...
vanderpumprules,flepx0g,t1_flefojj,1585089150.0,"This season/last season has been my favorite cast.  

Season 2 only had one of the twins which helped."
CoronaBumpers,fld0ctd,t3_fo2p60,1585053044.0,"I was doing fine for a while till NY Presbyterian changed their policy.  It’s a tough call and one I do not envy.  I can see both sides on whether this was necessary or extreme,

It’s just a little too close to my state which is why I’m nervous since the tri state area economy and traveling is so intermingled.  I am blessed to have a governor who was one of the first ones to shut down the state.  His decision may have saved us.  I am due at the end of June so either shit will be hitting the fan or we will be on the decline based off the “estimations”

My heart breaks for those who lost their job, for small business going under, for all the other Parents struggling.  My best friend may have to cancel her wedding which is awful.  

Idk just getting into a bit of depression.  I miss my family and friends.  Luckily I can still meet with my therapist through video chat.  Stay strong ladies"
