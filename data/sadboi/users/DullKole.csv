SuicideWatch,fbqed2p,t1_fbqbhac,1577030832.0,"I have pretty bad anxiety that limits me a lot, but for about half a year our living conditions were stable, my parents were always happy there which made me feel less stressed out. 

It feels impossible to put myself first, I do want to see people happy but it sometimes feels like that's all I'm good for. 

Thanks for taking the time out of your day to comment, it means a lot to me."
SuicideWatch,fbpwzpz,t1_fbpscv2,1577025943.0,Maybe watch something you enjoy on your phone? It'll get better but for now try to stay afloat and bide some time. I hope you do well and be the person you want.
SuicideWatch,fbpkfgl,t3_ee40xi,1577022075.0,I really only stay to see my family or friends happy. Double edged blade in a way. At least they are happy.
