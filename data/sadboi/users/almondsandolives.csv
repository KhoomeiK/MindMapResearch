Well, on one of the subreddits i was looking at, a girl I went to rehab with posted terrible self harm pictures where she cut her stomach open and was picking out her fat. It was horrific. I reached out to her sister in law on Facebook really concerned, she told my friend i reached out instead of being concerned, and my friend said to stop harassing her. We both ended back up in rehab at the same time and she felt awkward but i just loved on her. We eventually got over the awkward.
