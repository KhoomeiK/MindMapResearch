I've never been in a relationship and in 2013 just when I found an ideal partner, I found out he wanted children and he found out I didn't. We loved each other, but I knew I would never budge on this and I knew he couldn't see his future without children of his own. I let him go. I cried my little eyes out for an entire year. It got easier when he moved back to his home country. That helped *a lot*. That's what I think will make this easier for you. Move away from him if you can. The closer he is the harder this will be on the both of you.

As hard as it may be to come to terms with, things will never be the same. There can be no compromises here. He wants them and you don't want them. You can't possibly ""meet in the middle"" with a situation like this. It's going to hurt, but it's time to let go."

It's either RBF or a smile and either way we're wong.

Same goes for the compliment thing. Guys say they want more compliments from random girls, but what if we're just trying to give a random compliment and a guy takes it as something more? This isn't an easy thing to navigate for women and girls."
short,fp3ib91,t3_gb256m,1588279796.0,"Not all of us do. You only see the bad highlighted on reddit. The ""6'0 and above swipe right"" pictures. That is not all women. If you meet someone and they have no wiggle room on their height preference then it's a requirement and you can't change that. Don't dwell on them and move on. It will matter to who it matters to, but it doesn't matter to everyone."

gentlefemdom,fp3g0n4,t3_gasof7,1588278658.0,"Because as dommes we know better than to rely heavily online. All we get from posting ads online is dick pics, abuse, pua types trying to ""convert us"" (this has happened to me many, many times). A lot of us know it's just not always worth it. Even with strict, specific, carefully crafted personals I end up with 50+ messages that go ""hi kik"".

We are here. We do respond to personals that appeal to us, but the majority are a laundry list of their kinks and what *we* can do for *them*. Nothing else. Most ads reek of ""I want a kink dispenser"".

Subs, a well crafted ad does get attention. It really does. When I would see personals with more than their kinks (actually if you can do without those then the ad will garner more attention) I jump at the chance to get to know him better. There's nothing wrong with wanting sex only, but be honest and upfront about it. It saves everyone time."
gentlefemdom,fp3eqpv,t1_fp1r262,1588278025.0,">The GFD space on Reddit is not always very friendly to women, though there are plenty of lovely people of all genders in this community and I do personally feel the nasties are just a vocal minority. This particular area of Reddit has for some reason attracted a lot of incels, MGTOWs and other types of men who just plain don't like women very much. As a result dommes often prefer to lurk rather than interact.

I'm very, very glad I'm not the only one who has noticed this. It has become a huge problem."
gentlefemdom,foz42z4,t3_gab6ua,1588184342.0,Yes. No one is attracted to everything and you can't force attraction. Regardless of what they are you are entitled to your prefrences and requirements. Attraction is a very important part of a relationship.
short,foyq0va,t1_foym0xk,1588177057.0,"If by ""shitting on the guys in this sub"" you mean pointing our hypocrisies and double standards, defending short women, making the occasional complaint of things not fitting well, then sure."
gentlefemdom,foymifg,t3_ga51so,1588175189.0,I'm glad more and more dommes are speaking up about these kinds of things. Never give anyone the effort they aren't giving you. You're worth far more than that.
gentlefemdom,foylx0v,t1_foxv2e2,1588174875.0,"I wonder how he'd feel if that was said about how frequently male mental health posts are made, upvoted, gilded, and aknowledged?

Don't let anyone shame you on this. This needs to be said and the fact that it has annoyed people is indicative of how people know this is a problem, but don't want to do anything about it lest their fantasy be ruined."
