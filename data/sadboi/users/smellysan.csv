And the fact that you own the legitimate copy of the game and you modify it yourself, you have  the rights to it, nintendo doesnt own the inside game item.

but yeah at the end i think all of these is just opinion, gamefreak itself doesnt say its illegal, and still allowed it, so we cant say its illegal"
