traumaticchildhood,fdths60,t3_ecoyyv,1578716950.0,"Im home for the holiday and my dad invited my abuser over for the weekend- knowing the details. I said I had forgiven him was his excuse. Does not mean I ever want to see him again. It is a family member , and i've been struggling so hard from all my childhood trauma the last year. It has affected my entire life.  Im 26 and just going back to college. Im lost. So sad. And feel so alone."

AskReddit,f542ja7,t3_dmg0y2,1571969532.0,"Omg where to begin with my school. Our superintendent and his wife were stealing money to re decorate their home. We‚Äôre caught and went to jail. 
One of the male teachers was having an affair with his student. She would flirt with him during class, and when she graduated they started dating for realzy. 
One of the female teachers did coke with the students, and partied a lot with them. 
Our art teacher got a dui on her bicycle and still was allowed to work there. 
Our marine science teacher was a huuuuge hippie and would leave class for periods of time and come back reaking of pot.
Finally one time a student slipped acid into his English teachers coffee and he started throwing chairs at students.

Nothing major hit news or anything besides the stealing but the infamy passed down to other students haha"
