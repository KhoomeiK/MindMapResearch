Also the pell grant was my only form of income. So they will just use my taxes that i filed to see if i am still eligible? I called dpss earlier and they said when I renew my medi-cal to just include my 2019 tax form and I should be fine. So my monthly income is automatically determined by IRS  from the taxes i filed with them if i am understanding you correctly."

 ""A false negative skin test can occur if a live vaccine, such as MMR,
is given BEFORE the TB skin test is done. If MMR vaccine is given, you should wait at least 4 weeks before doing the TB skin test.
All vaccines, live or inactivated, can be given on the same day or at any time AFTER a TB skin test is done.""

So I am still wondering if I could  do the TB test first and get it read and then after reading get the vaccine."
