exchristian,f8vvbfc,t3_e2ftkl,1574877975.0,"I was raised in a very cult-like evangelical church. Forced to attend a minimum of 3 times per week.  The pastors wife was the sunday school teacher and she would draw giant pastel pictures of kids burning in hell for no obeying their parents.  This scared the shit out of me and did some serious mental damage.  When I was 17, I moved out and left the church as well. When I was 23, I found a new church, because I was too brainwashed to stay away.  The new church was just another cult with slightly different practices.. faith healing.  When the lead choir guy was arrested for raping multiple adopted children, I finally started seeing it for what it was.  I moved away from that area and never looked back. Several years went by, I became a dad, and found out that church had nothing to do with morals or values and everything to do with greed and brainwashing people into following orders.  The hardest part about it all these years later is seeing my family members stuck in the church and constantly pushing me to return. My nephew just finished ministry school and it showing some serious signs of mental abuse.   I understand you guys all too well and i'm thankful to have come to reddit and found this sub."

secularbuddhism,f8td1bz,t1_f8sjc0k,1574800839.0,great perspective.. I know that I am quite resentful as a disgruntled Ex-Evangelical Cult member. I was forced into it at birth and disowned by 90% of my family when I left it. Buddhist showed me that I could find a little peace without the fears of 'Hell'  and all of the cultish bs.
