depression,f6zmkx1,t1_f6z2veb,1573318631.0," I am so sorry for what happened to you and for what you're going through right now! :( :( :( :( D: D: D: D: I Hope and Pray that you will feel better at some point. In the meantime, keep trying your best - like you're already doing. Have you been able to get away from your Parents at least? That'd seem like a MAJOR step to me. I understand if you haven't been able to do it, though - it's not as easy as it may seem. It is not your fault. Twenty is still young and you still have your Whole Life ahead of you to make som changes. Start from some small ones. Hopefully it will get better and better from there. Just do what you can, ok, my Dear And Sweet Friend? Please keep taking care of yourself - that's really ALL one can do in certain situations, am I right? In Any Case, Please DO Try To Be Kind To Yourself And Other People As Well As Much AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN! Try To Give Some Of The Same Kindness That You Give To Other People To Yourself As Well. You Deserve It. You'Re Equal To EVERYONE HERE And You Deserve EQUAL Love And Respect As Well! You Are Important And YOU MATTER! :) :) :) :) :D :D :D :D"
depression,f6zi0jm,t3_dtvy7v,1573316971.0," It is absolutely normal to grieve for several years after the Death and Loss occured. There isn't a time limit set in stone. So please, do NOT feel guilty about it, ok? :) With that said, I am TRULY, DEEPLY SORRY for your LOSSES and for your Grandparent's Death especially! :( :( :( :( Please do take ALL the time that is necessary to you to Grieve, no matter how long it is to you. Everyone is different and does things at his own pace and time. Keep taking care of yourself as well, my Friend. As for your ex-Girlfriend, that must have certainly hurt you badly, but try to see the ""bright"" side: at least you were able to find you what kind of person she TRULY was and you didn't spend or waste too much time with a person who DIDN'T truly Love you. You are 17 and you still have you Whole Life ahead of you! I am sure you have heard that many times already, but I hope it doesn't hurt you if I say that again. I apologize if I DID hurt you! :( In any case, Grieve as much as you need to, ok? You're perfectly fine just the way you are. There is NOTHING ""wrong"" or ""weird"" about what you're doing. Please ALWAYS remember that, no matter what other people may say to you. Sending many safe, warm hugs to BOTH you, your Family, your Friends and ALL of your Loved Ones! Keep fighting and keep rocking no matter what happens, ok, My Dear, Sweet Friend? :) :) :) :) :D :D :D :D"

Even if we don't completely heal, at the very least, we may be able to get through Life like most """"normal"""" people do. I am sorry if this is a cliché phrase, but... Don't give up! :) :) :D :D"
