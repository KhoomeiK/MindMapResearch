unpopularopinion,fohbpr4,t3_g6zbbh,1587763298.0,"I don’t think rich people should give more to charity because they have money. The majority of people could spear more than they do to give to charity, a rich person is giving more money anyway but it’s the same percentage or even more than a lower waged person. Just because someone made money doesn’t mean they have to give it away. I’m not rich but I could give more to charity than I do and this is the same with everyone."

depression,fcw6q2p,t3_ej7ihp,1578018417.0,After years if people telling me to do a journal I started a 0-10 one. This allows me to have some hope to get through the shit times. If I have had a 3/10 it’s a “good” day because I don’t want to die or hurt myself at every turn if I have had a 0/10 it’s a bad day and I have no motivation to do anything but plan how I’m going to hurt my self or die. Seeing that I have “good” days helps because I know that in a few days I’ll be back there and not just laying in bed feeling hopeless. It helps me get through the harder day’s if you want to you could have a go but it took a lot of motivation for me to start it but because I hate letting people down I have done it every day for a month and a half which is a big thing for me.
selfharm,fcw4fou,t3_ej20sb,1578016911.0,"The first time I “missed” a night I felt like I needed to punish my self so for a while I banged my head on every surface, cut myself loads and self-sabotaged at every move. Eventually it gets easier to ignore for longer and hopefully for you it will too. I still feel bad when I’m not doing it but I can ignore or block out them feelings longer."
selfharm,fcvqs9i,t3_ej20sb,1578007996.0,For a while I couldn’t go a day with out cutting then it was 2 then it was 3 and it kept gradually increasing with some periods of less time between and some periods of longer I can now sometimes go 20 days it gets better despite how much I (and maybe you) wanna do it virtually all the time.
