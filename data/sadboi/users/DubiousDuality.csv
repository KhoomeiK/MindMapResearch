Anxiety,fm21u9t,t1_fm20l0b,1585689079.0,"Wow, it seems that there is a lot of early pressure on students in your country... Unlike in mine, where not many people care lol.

As somebody who is about to finish uni I can reassure you that studying is definitely worth it, but it's also not as frightening in the long run. I have gone through 6 study years of having 5-6 lectures every working day of the week, in a very demanding uni, and survived... So I'm sure you can too! I have gone through my own period of study stress, but have learned the ""here and now"" technique, where I just think about where I am right now and not the future. Anxiety can paint a grim fate for you, so this method helped me a lot. Maybe it can help you too?"

I am also new to this sub, and also reddit, I am happy to talk to people in English. But I can't talk for too ling, because of time zones (it is night where I am)... Oh well! I don't mind though, it helps with my anxiety!

Have you found new interesting subs?"
Anxiety,fm1zizz,t3_fsg7m6,1585687861.0,"Oh I feel you... I am 2nd year Master's, but the situation is the same: our professors think we have more time for assignments, so they pile them up on us, with no time for writing the main huge assignment (80 pages). I feel stressed too, and also kind of like a failure, because my classmates are definitely having an easier time doing homework.

But I can tell you definitely that, if you want to cry and let off steam, you should do it! As somebody who can't cry, I think crying is a blessing. Maybe let yourself relax, watch a movie or play a game, a few hours can't hurt.

Don't worry, it will all be great!"
Anxiety,fm1y37c,t3_frslfn,1585687099.0,"Don't worry, you're definitely not alone in this! In fact, I can say for sure, that even as I write this comment, I think of every singly person on this sub (or any other forum) turning against me for something ""wrong"" that I might have done... It's irrational, but it's something that I get every time I write a comment. It's like that in real life too, I have problems reading people's emotions/reactions, so sometimes, it feels like people are super angry with me (especially when I expect a reply and there isn't any). But I think talking face-to-face is still better, so I feel where you're coming from... Maybe try voice chat?"

I'm glad that I can share my worries here, because my mom is always like ""Nah, whatever""."

Anxiety,flfzqt2,t3_foloua,1585124394.0,"Hi, I have this too sometimes. Different variations, but the worst I've had was my body jerking uncontrollably, shaking and tensing up. It may be withdrawal from epilepsy pills (I cut down on half a pill before it happened), but it was still some of the worst night anxiety I have ever felt.

It really helps to just mentally calm down and focus on calming down the shaking. I may geet adrenaline rushes, but at least I get shaking under control.

I wish you good dreams!"
Anxiety,flfzjgz,t3_folpxa,1585124143.0,"Fear of failure prevents me from making any progress in my life. I am so afraid to fail, that, despite my wishes to succeed and become good at something, I just won't budge. Just because I didn't succeed on my first try. There are many factors why, but I have come to think that I don't have the ability to learn and therefore there is no point. I wish I were more brave.

I think there were a few moments in my life where I toughed it out, but I don't remember them, unfortunately :( . My failures haunt me, and I remember every single one of them in great deatil."

What does an Octarian look like when smiling? Not even a small smile, but full on big woomy grin?"
Anxiety,flfz01q,t1_flfipuf,1585123498.0,"Oh, thankfully not... But I have frequent nightmares, and as a kid I used to have lucid dreams of a dark entity with tiny glowing red eyes sitting on me and stifling my breath. It made me call for mom and scream when I finally woke up. I'm not sure if it's paralysis or not, but I looked it up and it shows pictures with a similiar figure. Thankfully, it's gone now.

I also get woken up at night a lot by loud sounds, because I live right next to a railroad, and the trains sometimes signal at night. And there is also a crazy driver that races at night in an ancient car. It's ungodly loud! These sudden sounds make my body tense up so hard that it feels like I'm going to have epilepsy (I am on pills but still :( ). It makes me worry too.

I wish you good dreams today!"
Anxiety,flfybz0,t1_flef9cf,1585122705.0,"Thank you! I don't meditate but I recently started praying before sleep, it helps me a lot. Also, I try to distance myself away from the computer (I study at home now)."
