I guess it's more nuanced than that. In media stories of men getting angry and acting out there are [sometimes] flippant remarks about the size of his genatalia. At the very least it is inappropriate. This, of course, then normalizes this behaviour which is extremely damaging to some men. 

Perhaps this is another issue of only noticing because the remark affects an ""in group"" that you (in the general sense) are apart of.

When it spread that I was involuntarily hospitalized I lost pretty much all my social circle.

Nobody knows I have BP (they assumed it was depression) except my family; but they don't really understand it due to culture. But based on the conversations people at my work have about mental illness I know I made the right choice in keeping it a secret.

I know this isn't the answer this subreddit likes to hear but once it's out there you can't never 'unsay it'. I do not disclose either at work or in academics.

You must carefully assess your situation before you choose to disclose, in my opinion. How do the people you interact with feel about mental illness? Usually you can tell their feelings by their use of language on the subject.

I can't help but believe that disclosure of mental illness would 100% affect my ability to get hired (I'm aiming to work in corporate). As for my current job; there would absolutely be gossip if I disclosed it - my current boss is a traditional guy so he would probably consider me incompetent/crazy/attention-seeking from that point forward.

That may be true, but the only person making that distinction is you.

To everyone else (I'm guessing you're white, apologies if I'm incorrect) you are the majority. Also consider that for many, English is a second language. As you are familiar with social anxiety during conversations now imagine trying to do that whole conversation in a foreign language - you can see why they don't approach to strike up a conversation. Also some cultures it is improper/unnatural to begin a full-length dialogue with a stranger on the street. Furthermore, consider that many have had racist experiences with white people in the past. Even if they wanted to approach you they have no idea if they're going to be yelled at or cussed - why bother trying to navigate that mindfield, right? It'd be easier just to socialize around kinfolk.

Like you, but for different reasons, immigrants thus take a passive approach to interacting with members outside their tribe.

>Ultrasound. No heartbeat. Techs don't give that sort of news. I enter, and break the news to them. The fetus is no longer viable. I am very sorry...

>Woman reaction - Tears, crying. But then very down to business in many cases. What happens now? Who do we see now? Where is that? When will this happen? and so forth. They will spend the rest of their lives dealing with this loss, and pain. Many times openly to at least someone. Confide in a friend, their mother, a therapist. Long term. Slow burn.

>Male reaction - Stoic silence, quiet tears, holding wife's hand.

Grief, loss, sadness, confusion, desperation...everything. This is his one chance to let his defenses down. He will never see me again. He can show me this now. Quickly. Like an explosion its so fast and powerful.

>When the wife reappears - Its like nothing ever happened. Back to quietly stoic. Bottling it up. Keeping it all hidden. All inside. He feels that he ""has"" to be strong. He ""has"" to keep himself together to help his wife and family.

>He will go and have beers with his mates in a few weeks and he will have a stoic attitude there as well. ""Yeah I'm doing okay, you know but Theresa is really struggling.

BipolarReddit,ezjxkhq,t3_d13zew,1567951826.0,"Been to both involuntary and then moved to voluntary.

Most people in voluntary are chill, maybe a bit weird or awkward. You'll be very bored but just socialize and attend the group sessions (e.g. painting and stuff).

Involuntary is a whole different animal. I'll never forget the experience and the screaming; kinda still fucked up by it. But I digress.

Best use of time is to utilize hospital resources to find a combination of medicine that works for you AND develop a plan to recognize when you are spiralling into depression or becoming manic that you can share with those very close to you. That way you ""catch"" yourself before you destroy everything you worked your ass off for.

Another good idea is to begin the habit of keeping a mood journal. Record what you felt and why you felt it; some apps have a rating function which allows you to rate your day from 1-10. This is also super helpful to see your long-term mood trends an helps identify if you're starting to lose it a bit."

Everyone gets booted but if you're playing you obviously shit yourself and rush to get back in - and you do.

If you're autowalking or clicking or whatever you're out. I personally like it, it's about as fair as they can get other than forced logout timers imo.

Gonna be fucked on the weekend tho cause some people definitely do get kicked after waiting 5 hours and playing 5mins. It's not a perfect system."

I was diagnosed as manic depressive in the hospital and they took me off Sertraline straight away but I refused to take anymore meds upon release.

3 years of cycling later and I finally found out I needed an anti-psychotic first. Seroquel was my saving grace and I manage the depression through thought exercises and good life habits."

BP2, I'm quite introverted but can be very sociable. It just takes a lot out of me.

It runs on temperature and salinity [density] differences between bodies of water to form global gyres that transport water anticlockwise around the oceans.

If all of the ice melts or the ocean gets too hot this system shuts down (its already slowing). So... good luck to us, I guess."
