People who don't get angry with me and know my actions are often the result of illness and help me think up strategies to avoid making the same mistakes again in the future.

For example,  me and alcohol don't mix. I can't have one drink I have none or all the drinks. Do stupid fucked up shit and then go into a severe depressive cycle. So they don't offer me alcohol, don't invite me to socialize with people who would encourage me to drink and if I do start drinking,  remind me it is a very bad idea and take me out of the situation. 

People who notice when I'm getting agitated, especially when already in a manic phase, and get me out of the situation and take me somewhere calmer before the situation escalates. 

People who point out when someone isn't a good friend for me. And knowing that some people aren't,  even if they're not bad people, just that they tend to not have the personal boundaries I need.

Then you also have to have their whole life - their family (including partner & offspring), their personal history (including every shitty thing that has ever happened to them), their home, their daily life etc.

Another thing I find that helps is to use it to identify whether there are things in your life you are not happy with / want to change and work on how you can achieve those.

Also, speak to your friends, cos I find when you do it tends to come as a shock to them and they tend to say ""really? Cos I wish I had xyz that you have"" or similar.

3) working out what you want - ignore everyone else and focus on you. Then look for how you can reasonably achieve those things.

Also why should your children (who seem to be similar ages to their cousin) be forced to lose every single game or activity they do so that another child of the same age doesn't.  All it does it teaches your kids their cousin is far more important in the wider family than they are, that they don't matter.

 Tbh this is why I would not want my child to apologise for the sake of peace. It teaches them that they are worth less than a spoilt brat and that they have to apologise when they have done nothing wrong. Especially if the nephew/cousin is not punished for smashing up the games room."
