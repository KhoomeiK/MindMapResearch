It's a crappy thing to make fun of. It's like making fun of stretch marks, boobs sagging and stuff that naturally come with age/changes in body for a lot of people. Stuff they can't control and that they've probably noticed and already don't feel so good about. If is DEFINETLY body shaming."

My question is,, is there a chance they'll send me back home because of the fact that I'm not depressed right now? I'm scared of enabling this cycle to continue because it's not the first time I feel okay after self-harming or being swarmed with suicidal thoughts. 

As I said, it's like a cycle: get very sad/depressed, self-harm, feel okay, get angry at myself or unable to handle the sudden positive emotions, self-harm again out of frustration, get sad again and so on.

Then I wake up again and it repeats a few times.  Sometimes I go outside my room and it's when shit gets really creepy, can't even describe it.

When I finally actually wake up I don't even know if I'm awake. I've tried stuff like placing a chair near my bed so it looks abnormal and you'd assume in my dreams it won;t be there, but my brain immediately just puts the chair in my dream too.

stevenuniverse,f6pa5jw,t3_dse56r,1573051540.0,"The whole song speaks to me so much, but this line resonates even more. I constantly compare myself to the people around me and I do end up feeling like I'm not enough for them and as if they're giving me the entire world while I'm repaying them with absolutely nothing. It's one of the main drives of my d*pression, if I have to be honest. It's okay though, they occasionally try to remind me that isn't true.

I feel like I hold everyone to much lower a standard than I do myself. I try to see the good in everyone while if I make one small mistake I cancel out everything good I've ever done. Deep down inside I believe everyone can be good, even myself. That's why I love Steven Universe so, so much! It just gives me hope in showing me forgiveness CAN pay off, compassion IS needed, and that everything around us shines in its own, beautiful way. 

Edit: Realised I deleted a part of what I wrote, haha. And formatting."
