depression,f5wlva9,t3_dpl4bu,1572526489.0,"I have the same feeling. Most people would honestly be shocked if I told them about having even a little depression, let alone the amount of sadness I feel on the daily."
depression_help,f5whsgb,t1_f5wgudm,1572524291.0,"In terms of advice, If you still really care about him, I would say just to let him know that you're there for him if he needs you."
depression_help,f5wgudm,t3_dpb02k,1572523674.0,"As someone who left their girlfriend due to depression, yeah at least for me I felt that I didn't want my troubles bleeding over to her, or for her to see how sad I was. The thought of her knowing just how sad I was made me feel worse about my depression. I know it'snot particularly the sanest train of thought, but that's depression for ya. I left to try and figure things out, in the meantime we decided to give things another try, then two weeks later she ghosted me, cheated, and left. So yeah depression sucks, and it can drive people away from each other. Just know that you're not alone."
