I am wondering if there is a device that combines the function of an external sound card with a headphone amp. Specifically, I am looking for a device that has XLR input w/phantom power, that is also a headphone amp/DAC (that can monitor directly) to hook up to my desktop. I don't need a ton of outputs or super granular controls.

I started out looking for a DAC, but figure if I can, I want to upgrade my soundcard/recording setup instead of just getting a DAC and adding another device to my desk. I don't have headphones picked out yet but I'm looking at a lot of the ones on Massdrop, not too sure yet.

I am looking to spend in the neighborhood of 200-500, but I'm not familiar with the price range of this kind of device. I also really like the look of tubes so I'd definitely shell out more for one with tubes :P

Thank you!!"

While we can't infer scientific theory from religion that is not the only question, religious practice can help to settle the mind when it mulls over big questions like what happens when we die.

Religion can do surprisingly well at eliminating these questions. I find daoism, and other eastern religions, particularly enlightening because it removes the idea of the self, eliminates the 'soul' of the individual.

I agree that some humans don't need religion, but on the whole it seems it's important for humans to have religion to help us grapple with our finite existence against the infinity of time.

This isn't to say you should take advantage of others at this time, but in a recession you are able to make bigger leaps in the actual value of your assets because of the low apparent worth in dollars.

The difficulty, for me at least, is that these questions are overwhelming and constant. Sitting with each question and will allow you to get to the heart of the matter and figure out how you want to act in the future, it can help to talk it out with someone else if you are feeling pessimistic.

We are all flawed, regardless of the face that people present to the world. Rising above that, you can examine yourself honestly and use that information to improve.
