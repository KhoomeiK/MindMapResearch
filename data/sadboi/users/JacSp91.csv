nextfuckinglevel,fo530au,t1_fo30yq2,1587516411.0,"I absolutely understand your frustration. Sadly I cannot relate to your area of study, but i can relate to your roommate's, since i have a degree in Music Education as well.  


Yes, your roommate will definitely need hands on experience teaching, but sadly this cannot be the case (just yet). However, my suggestion for him (if he's not doing this during online classes) would be to write lesson plans and have them being reviewed by his professor. Yes, not being able to apply those plans isn't great, but at least he'd have them in his back pocket. Depending on his area of Music Ed he could learn fingering charts for woodwind or brass instruments (as a Drum Set player that was essential during my student teaching semester). Those are just a few ideas off the top of my head  
But to do so he will need communication and guidance from his professors, which is why online classes (or at least online council) could still be helpful for him.  


Once again I'm sorry i can't be more helpful for your situation.   
I absolutely understand that there are issues with online education and that everybody learns differently, but cancelling class seems a bit rash (or at least in my opinion)"
