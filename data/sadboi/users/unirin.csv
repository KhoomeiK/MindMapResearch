2. You are going to be fine. I had that type of feeling when my boyfriend tried to leave me I told him ""everything that is bad will happen."" He took it as a threat and I was like no, no... it isn't. Truth is people will always say what they mean at that time and you can't get upset at them for thinking it's too much and leaving. It isn't anything to do with you. Yes having relationships is a little harder for us, but I can promise you nothing bad is going to happen because now you got back stabbed. You aren't fully alone either as many of us exist in this world. It too me a while and now I have a new person who really does work with my illness and works with me on things. He is fully aware that I get paranoid or I can dive off into the deep end and believe things that never really happened. And instead of running, he started to build systems to help us. It's okay. 
3. People out grow each other and trust is something that is consistently earned. Life is a series of patterns and changes. It's hard but right now you don't feel you can trust anyone, I think the best possible answer is find someone who you can trust. I find talk therapy super beneficial to me because I basically pay someone who legally has to keep what I say in our sessions a secret (unless they feel I will cause self harm or harm to others). People also say they can't afford therapy, can possibly find therapy that is pro-bono done by students who are working clinic hours to get their license.

I don't mind working and slaving everyday if that means I can go home and create music or art. I decided i just wanted to make music and art for myself and I am 100% willing to share it to the world and build a company from it. But i also decided it's okay if i continuously fail at it as long as i make sure i enjoy doing it. I genuinely enjoy making music and art and i do hope i make thigns that can help toher people heal.   


I honestly developed a simple philosophy to follow that made my depression and anxiety way less than it is.   
1) Form the Buddhist practice i took ""if i do not want i do not suffer""  
2) Do not question why you exist, give yourself a reason to exist.   
3) Happiness can only be manifested from the self.   
4) Instead of fighting my illness, understand it, unify with it. 

5) You are not them, do not compare yourself to the people around you.   


I don't know if any of this helps but it helped me.   
It overall allows me to focus on myself and I created projects for myself to find fulfillment in my own life. i decided not to rely on others because relationships just hurt me more and i have  trouble since my paranoia makes me think the person i am close to wants to kill me. And as I keep growing this way.. with my philosophies i found it easier to navigate through life. And when i have trouble i just pray or read my tarot cards... but at the end of the day I stopped listing what bad has happened and listed what good has happened."

TBH medication doesn't work for everyone."

Let me go find the answer one second."
schizophrenia,eqrrtyh,t1_eqrrmi8,1560268355.0,I think some will be friends others might have to be tools. I'm using art and music as an outlet to allow the voices space to come out into the real world... though both worlds to me are real... In fact I want to turn them into characters and bring them to life here in the real world. i think even if they don't become my friends at the very least if i can show people their existence maybe they won't be as bad anymore.
schizophrenia,eqrrlss,t1_eqrrhai,1560268203.0,YEEEs... but I learned one voice I thought was bad wasn't actually bad at all. Just protective and skeptical...
schizophrenia,eqrrk5a,t1_eqrraar,1560268171.0,Man I thought my mom was going to kill me. So I fell asleep after her and woke up before her. I even thought she's kill me for donating clothes wen i was 25 years old ... clothes i wore at 13.
schizophrenia,eqrqg2v,t1_eqrq2ov,1560267423.0,Same :) It was so nice to know that half of it was just me thinking she hated me... and it wasn't true.
schizophrenia,eqrqemv,t1_eqrpmr1,1560267397.0,"To be honest meds make them all gone and i feel lost without them. I had a horrible time adjusting as I had them for so long when things are quiet I can't handle it. It gets worse. I've taken a different approach where I interact with them more during my own time. But sometimes they forget I do that. I mean... they aren't real but lately they have been good at letting me give them their time and they giving me mine...

my relationship with my mom got better after I moved out and hse wasn't as close. once i got help and started talking to her again I learned she never hated me... like i thought"
schizophrenia,eqrphkd,t3_bzbb8i,1560266775.0,My aunt was schizophrenic and when i started to get weird visions and hallucinations  I was scared to talk about it. The time I did my mom took me to a priest. It started when i was 13. And he told my mom I can hear demons. It became a pretty interesting event....
schizophrenia,eqror3n,t3_bz9ngy,1560266268.0,"omg tasting blood is a thing. 0-0 I thought my mouth was just naturally bloody and I was tasting blood because of the cell walls in my mouth were too thin. WHAT.   


Okay okay okay. First of all.. There is no test for schizophrenia. I would seek another psychiatrist. I work with someone who doesnt try to test me but rather listens to me to help me ""absorb' or ""unify"" my voices. Since they are so loud and pesky I wanted to start making them a part of me than thinking they aren't.   


If you want help maybe try talk therapy instead... there are schizophrenics who are well put together from normal people observation. Unless I speak up no one knows that I'm schizo. Even my mom doesn't believe me.   


I have learned to basically not speak verbally and this actually causes issues cause I thought I told a real life person something but I didn't .... but overall I have defense mechanisms in order to not look ""crazy"". I do rituals and developed OCD habits to keep myself from LOOKING CRAY CRAY. but that doesn't mean that the underlying cause is because. I see the shadows etc.   


In fact the brain is malleable and I have learned that I can turn my scary ""ghosts"" into characters i draw out. But then again I'm delusional and think Im a witch or psychic. Long story short.
