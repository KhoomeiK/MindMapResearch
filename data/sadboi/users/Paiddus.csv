- D√©j√† il faut savoir que transitionner c'est plus que seulement ""changer"" de genre c'est te fa√ßonner et d√©cider qui tu vas devenir, c'est √©norm√©ment d'introspection.
- Ensuite si tu cherches un psychologue pour discuter de tout √ßa fais bien attention √† certaine personne qui ""pathologisent"" la transition, ce n'est pas une maladie et c'est dangereux de penser que tu es malade (surtout pour l'estime de soit). Cela dit aller voir un psychologue ne signifie pas √™tre malade, √ßa signifie avoir besoin de parler de ses probl√®mes avec quelqu'un (autre que ami/famille) qui pourra t'aider √† t'orienter.
- Tu vie dans le nord de la France et de ce que je sais Lille est l'une des rares villes fran√ßaise poss√©dant des r√©seaux de m√©decin pour les personne transgenres (hors Sofect), donc c'est une bonne nouvelle ! 
- En ce qui concerne la famille, je sais que c'est tr√®s dur pour certaine personne et chaque situation est diff√©rente mais l'un des conseils que je peux te donner c'est ""demerde toi sans eux"" dans le sens o√π ta vie ne leur appartient pas, tu as le droit d'avoir une vie priv√©e, ne pas dire o√π tu vas tout le temps et pourquoi tu y vas, je sais que c'est facile √† dire comme √ßa mais les seules personnes transgenres que je connais qui ont une famille limite ont d√ª un moment o√π un autre s'√©manciper de leur famille, c'est dur, ce n'est pas l'id√©al, je sais aussi que d'autres personnes n'arrivent pas √† faire √ßa et ce n'est pas grave, il n'y a pas de solution magique juste tes solutions √† toi.
- Autrement je te conseil vivement de te rapprocher d'une association LGBT voir transgenre si il y en a l√† o√π tu vis, √ßa aide √©norm√©ment ! 

Je te souhaite bon courage dans tes d√©marches et tout le reste, force √† toi. Et si tu as besoin de discuter avec quelqu'un, mes dms sont ouvert, je n'ai pas solution √† tout mais je peux au moins √©couter."

Travestite like I said also come from the French word ""travestie"" which come from the old french participle past ""transvesti"" used by monarchy where they wanted to disguised like a regular citizen to not being recognized in the street, it then was later used to describe people cross dressing to the other gender like in theatre where male actors who needed to play as a female character had to wear women's cloth and makeup"

First of all you need to know that psychiatrist and psychologist are a complete different thing, psychiatrist are formed to help people with mental illness where a psychologist is someone that help you talk about your problem and guide you to find solution to your problems. Psychiatrist are doctors, they can give you medicine where psychologist are generally not doctors. Now every health professional don't get the same formation, some can have a very old and conservative mind because we learned them that way and some don't and are aware of today's transgender issues (yeah there is not a lot of people in that category but they exist nonetheless).

The point of Tyson here is that the number of death from terrorism is really nothing compare to the number of people cancer kills every year, car accident and such, we all know someone who died from a disease, accident, suicide and I am not saying people who died by terrorism are less important, every death not matter the cause is a tragedy however seeing the whole picture of our society maybe we should give more resources to medical field, transport field, etc. where a lot more people lose their life.

ask_transgender,evw0qhu,t3_clk3jj,1564852203.0,"Hey hello, first of all that is a difficult situation you're facing here however it's not a dead end. Even if I am transgender that I am out for about 2 years now and I have a pretty good situation where I live and with my family I can try and give you some advice.

My family is not the most progressive one, my mother works in a factory a my dad is an ex-military with a very cis het manly attitude. I was also scared to told them so I started slowly I talk to my mom first then my dad when I felt ready. It went pretty ok, they accepted me, my mom was actively supportive, my dad had some issues at first, we pretty much did not talk for a while after I told him but he tried his best, he tried calling me by my real name, he had trouble at first because he was used to my dead name but with time he made it. I love them and I know they love me and tried their best. Also being your true self and express it isn't a good reason for your parent to be upset, they might don't understand but it's true, being a family means unconditional love. If they don't get that that's there problem and not yours.

I think every society around the world is transphobic, people tend to be scared of what they don't know, of what they can't understand, they can act like assholes. You'll have to adapt sadly until they society adapt it self to you, it doesn't necessarily means to hide your true self but to be prepare to some event you might get involved in, could be assault, insults, misgendering, administrative or medical difficulties. With time you'll acquire some defense mechanism for those events, the ones that suits you. Having moral support helps a lot too, could be friends, family members, therapist, doctors, your lgbt local group support.

For the economic part of not being able to get some medical transition I don't have any advice I am sorry about that, luckily I live in a country where I don't have to pay a cent to got HRT, I think some people around the world try to get an assurance or something that cover the cost of a medical transition, it could be a good thing to search about that, I know you're 16 and that might not apply to you right know but I don't know, it doesn't really cost anything to do some research.

One last thing, you said that :

>i realize that at such a good age for transition, I can not afford it either morally or financially

You're kinda true, 16 is a good age to start a transition although you can start a transition at any age, it's not a race and the more you get older doesn't affect the ""efficiency"" of your transition, what affects it is your own effort, your goal, the environment you're living in and luck. And even if you're not passing yet, you did not started your transition it doesn't mean you're not a girl (in your case), your gender identity belongs to you and you only and you're valid no matter other people might think !

Wishing you the best of luck, don't forget you're not alone and be safe :)

- You'll lose some friends, you'll be surprised how some of them are actually supportive and kind to you, you'll also make new friends.
- It will be hard for your family as well, some member of your family will be supportive some will be confronted with their own transphobia, it doesn't mean they don't love you however they can act like dicks and hurt you, you'll have to challenge that, find some way to respond to them and be strong.
- It will be emotionally difficult.
- It's 100% worth the effort.

Try your best to be prepared, try to find resources, take your time, find people that can help you, it can be friends, random strangers on reddit, therapist. 

I am wishing you the best of luck ! Have a good day"
ptsd,evs1ruj,t3_ckwz6d,1564726273.0,"Hello I am new here I've just been diagnosed with PTSD this week and currently in the hospital. Someone on reddit helped me and provided me this sub-reddit. 

That's the first time I am interacting here. I've been thinking the same this week since I am not doing a lot those days except being in my thoughts. I feel like I am an imposter that I don't have PTSD, I might need a little more time to accept that reality and start dealing with it. 
I explained to the doctors everything that happened to me, the symptoms I have, the memories that come back and the anxiety crisis that happens to me. The doctors confirmed the diagnosis but somehow I still think I am just a kid with depression and social anxiety.

I hope with time I'll realise that and start to move on and get back to my life. I also hope you'll get better with your issues, I don't have any advice to give since I am still figure it out what's happening to me but I wish you the best."
MtF,evs16x3,t1_evrh58u,1564725604.0,HRT helps a lot with that problem I am hoping you'll get access to it as soon as possible and be happier with it (if it is your intent of course)
TwoXChromosomes,evpshem,t1_evpc75u,1564679436.0,"Thank you for your message, I had the appointment with the therapist and my parents today, the therapist was really awesome, she understood I got a little better today and told me I could get out of the clinic and continue a therapy outside of the hospital in few days. My parents are still afraid and worried but are getting better.

She understand that I am afraid of new places, that I am afraid of not being in control, she really seems to understand what I am into and that makes me feel better. She also told me something that was really kind and helpful (although a little bit odd not really correct). I talk to her about my trans identity, I said something like ""As a transgender woman..."" then she interrupted me and told me straight in the eye : ""you're not a transgender woman, you're a woman in your own right"". 

So I am feeling a lot better today, now I'll have to work with PTSD and how to deal with the situation and all the bad thoughts, I'll definitely check that subreddit. Thank you for your time and for the explanation. That's really kind of you"

traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,evb2pay,t1_evb1y8j,1564364169.0,"Ok so big disclaimer here I don't think piewd is transgender at all. I don't know shit about his personnal life. I just encounter some egg/gender crisis moment in some of his videos but that might be part of the character he's playing in front of the cam or just unrelated at all. And even if it's true and relate to something personnal that doesn't mean he's transgender.

The last time I checked he was presenting like a cisgender dude and should be seen as one (that's common sense, if you present as any gender you identify with you except people to treat you the way you identify, cisgender people have that right aswell)"
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,evb1y8j,t3_cix4un,1564363572.0,"That reminds me I genuinely thought at one point that piewdiepie was a transgender girl.

Like 2 month ago I think he was reviewing memes or something and share a personnal story on cam. The story was about his childhood and the fact that he had a female cartoon character as a model and wear dresses to look like her. Then he froze for like 30s and continued.

I don't know anything about his life at all but this thing looked clearly like a questioning gender moment."

I understand your point but celebrating non-shitty behaviour only because someone did not assault you or something like that should not be a thing.
If you start doing that you end up with ""nice guys"" who try acting nicely only to get something from someone and that's not how things works if you're a genuine nice person you don't except a reward from your actions."

And depression is making me weak like I don't have the energy to meet new people and start taking about those stuff.

I just feel lonely, I had problems with doctors and medicin and I am afraid those problems will come back. I just don't know what to do. It seems like everywhere I look I can't find a solution...."
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,ev3gasp,t3_ci497p,1564194587.0,"Disclaimer : I by no means want to criticize religion, I personnaly think it's a good thing.

That being said I find it really stupid and dangerous imposing your personnel belief (when it mostly implies religion) on others. Your faith and religion is something personnal and strictly personnal, your relation with your god.s (or any kind of belief) only implies you and you only. Do whatever you want, set your own interpretation and try not to get influenced by others. There is no conscencius when it comes to sacred texts.

I don't know if I it makes sense at all but what I am trying to say here is that your family and friends have their interpretation of all of that and it's up to you to make your own as well even if it's difficult and challenging to deal with their judgment.

I might be kicking into open doors here but I have this feeling that some people might be confused by those kind of situations. 

Hope you the best, have a great night."

That's pretty cool that you consider that an achievement but really ? The biggest ? People used to do that in 2010 but now they moved on. I am sure you have other cool hobbies and thing to accomplish in your life. 
I didn't meant to insult you in any way sorry if you felt like I did that.

The best you can do is being respectful, supportive, not doing to much, not making a big deal of her transidentity. Just treat her like your sister and act like one, she'll eventually see that and move on. Also don't push her to talk to you, if she needs to take her distance and if she need time to figure this all out let that happen."
