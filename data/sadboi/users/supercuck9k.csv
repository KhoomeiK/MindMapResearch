Kaladi brothers coffee is some of the best I've had.  Wolverine peak is a moderate climb you can do in a few hours and on a clear day you'd be hard pressed to find a better view of the Anchorage bowl.  The Anchorage botanical garden is beautiful.  Cannabis is also legal here, so if you ade 420 friendly there are some great dispensaries here, and almosy all offer a veteran discount.  Having said that, know the cannabis laws here.  There are near endless hiking trails in and around Anchorage.  

Seward is worth seeing, they have a really cool sea life center, and you can take Fjord tours from there to see glaciers and lots of wildlife; puffins, orcas, seals and humpback whales are all pretty common there during the summer.   

Some advice:  winterize your vehicle.  It has been -20 in Anchorage for the last few days.  Those temps aren't all that common here but it does get cold.  And oil pan heater and battery heater can be put in your vehicle diy.  Winter tires, studded or actual winter rated tires, it's common for the snow to melt and refreeze several times during the year, and the roads get deadly bad.  Finally, if you are going to be outdoors, even in Anchorage, during the summer, it is wise to carry bear spray.  The bears here are some of the largest in the world and they will eat you.  There were polars sighted recently near Anchorage hunting on the sea ice.  Carry gun, but not for bears, they can take a long time to bleed to death.  Also watchout for moose, they'll stomp you.  

Hope this helped even a little.  If you have ANY questions hit me up, I love this place and hope you enjoy it up here!"
