I do however agree that certain reboots of classic characters turned into women (ghost busters for example) come off as pandering to me. Over all I think it’s a good thing to film casting has become more diverse in recent years but I do not like it when it comes off as pandering or morally righteous.

Still DBT pretty much saved my life. I would suggest looking into DBT and other information relating to the illness and figure out what applies to you and what doesn’t, that way you can wrap your head around your issues and figure out how to deal with it by attacking the root of these specific issues.

That detox was one of the worst experiences of my life but I learned a lot from it and decided that I’m never going to put myself in that situation again, which means never drinking again. The detox wasn’t just bad because of the withdrawals, it was a detox where most of the people were court ordered and some of the people there were among the biggest scumbags I have ever met in my life (my room mate was a hit man for a biker gang, seriously, I also threatened to kill a guy because he threatened to sexually assault me).

But yeah, so many posts on this board are just people feeling sorry for themselves and it seems like they wants to bring everyone else around them down as well which honestly makes me really upset and disheartened, but I have to remember that I was in a similar position a few years ago, miserable and constantly feeling sorry for myself, I didn’t know what BPD was at the time but I thought my mental issues would potentially mean that I am a “broken” person which is fucking bullshit. I’m not broken and neither are you, we can turn our lives around but I’ll admit, it takes a lot of hard work. Facing my insecurities and battling my crippling addiction to alcohol was probably the most difficult thing to do in my entire life but I am so glad that I chose the right path.

I’m very into creating (and ingesting) art and music because it’s an outlet where I can channel different personalities, view points and ideas in a way that’s fresh and interesting to me, and is also personally fulfilling and confidence building to me. Writing also helps with this.

I think you’re on the right track though, someone who actually wants to help themselves and become a better person, not just cry in a corner and feel sorry for themselves.
