AMA,fg7l6dj,t1_fg6yy83,1580595195.0,"Excessive exercise has never been my main challenge but eating disorders will definitely make you do ridiculous things to try to lose weight. Even now, every time I park, I weigh up the pros and cons of parking far away - it takes more time but also means I’ll take more steps and burn more calories. At times I’d refuse to take my sleep medication so I wouldn’t sleep much because being awake burns more calories. I’ve definitely done laps around a store just to try to get in a bit more exercise whenever possible. 

I think my perspective is probably different because of all the things I’ve learnt during my illness and in different treatment programs. I think people can be beautiful and healthy at almost any weight and I think we all put too much emphasis on it.
That seems totally contrary to the rules I have for myself - and it is! Eating disorders are not logical at all. 
They make you think ridiculous things even if you know on some level it’s not true.

For example, I’ve had a panic attack about the calories in Oreos and it being different depending on if they’re in a family pack or an individual pack of four or six. I once had a nightmare that I went to the store and there were only Oreos there, of all different sizes, and none of the calorie amounts made sense!

I have great doctors, I’m really lucky in that aspect right now 😊"
AMA,fg6xd8h,t1_fg6nfxc,1580579073.0,"I’ve never been diagnosed as autistic or talked about it with a professional but, from learning about it, I can definitely see parts of myself in the criteria. I’m not sure if it’s enough to warrant an actual diagnosis - possibly not - and I’m not sure there’d be any benefit to one. I do agree with my BPD diagnosis and I’ve found it a helpful way to understand myself. 
Thanks!"

AMA,fg6fogd,t1_fg5zsu2,1580566633.0,"Well my diagnosis is anorexia nervosa. I guess that means my behaviors and thoughts fit into the DSM criteria. But really that means my thoughts and behaviors around food and weight interrupt my life significantly.
I think I’m biologically predisposed and I was exposed to unhealthy things when I was younger, which helped to trigger it.
And I mean unhealthy things like diet culture, saying some food is bad, being told we shouldn’t eat too much dessert, being warned about the dangers of the obesity epidemic etc"

AMA,fg6fak2,t1_fg6ac2w,1580566300.0,"I don’t really have any other sensory issues but I can be a little sensitive about touch sometimes. Mostly I just love soft things 😂
I’m also diagnosed with depression, anxiety, borderline personality disorder, and PTSD from an event three years ago."
AMA,fg6f4im,t1_fg5zi5l,1580566154.0,"No, not really, but I guess it kind of feels like the best I can do right now. I struggle with motivation a lot."
AMA,fg5wh7q,t1_fg5vzj6,1580541807.0,"Kind of yes and no. I see a dietitian and a therapist. My most recent admission was over the spring and summer and my weight has dropped since then but I’m trying to avoid it dropping super low so I can stay outpatient. However my team already feels like it’s ‘too low’ and I kind of disagree. I guess it’s more accurate to say I’m working on staying outpatient and avoiding another admission - whatever that looks like!
And thanks for the advice. Some days I’m so sick of it and I want to click my fingers and have it gone. Other days I seem to cling to it like the only lifesaver at sea"
juul,fbubd6n,t1_fbt6ng4,1577111363.0,"Yeah I was saying that ecigs increased by 14%, relative to their use last year. Tbh in the original study they should have worded it more clearly because it allows a lot of misinterpretation."
juul,fbrxqlh,t1_fbrtx5m,1577047542.0,"The INCREASE is 14%. Basically it INCREASED by 14%. And the decrease is only by 2%. It’s all relative.
Say you had a room of 100 random people - 2 have cancer and in the past year, now 4 people have cancer. That’s an increase of 100% - it doubled. That’s really significant. 
Let’s say in another room, 96 people have glasses, and next year 98 people have glasses. That is an increase of less than 2%, so that’s a really insignificant increase. 
Even though in both rooms the change between the years was ‘2 people’ or - ‘2 percent’, the relative difference is what matters."
