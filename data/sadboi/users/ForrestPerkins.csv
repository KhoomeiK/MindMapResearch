theHunter,ey68y5y,t3_cvt5hv,1566850110.0,"Only other games I've actually spent money on are a few mobile games.

I was fine paying EW for this experience because there is truly no other hunting experience on PC that comes close to this in terms of variety and realism.. 

I honestly need to pick up Cotw and see if I like it.

After the money I've invested I was anticipating further development of new areas of the game..
Are they going to keep doing seasonal events?"
theHunter,ey68lcx,t1_ey68djz,1566849876.0,"Thanks for your input. I hate to sound like a cheap bastard like I said, but I've personally never spent that much on ingame transactions. Monthly subscriptions perhaps but never for little items like I did."

quittingkratom,erd6t4y,t1_erd3tkx,1560732635.0,"They're working on boosting my lamictal right now. I'm also taking Sam e which is supposed to help, and they're tapering me off my antidepressant because they feel its making me apathetic. 

My bipolar disorder landed me in south Florida going from halfway house to halfway house, I've never had any issues with drugs besides kratom. I was forced to stop because of lab drug testing. I felt it really did help me. But you're right I need to be able to produce these chemicals naturally. It's really tough right now though. I'm on the verge of ordering some. I know it's a band aid but I'm so weak. I cant function."
