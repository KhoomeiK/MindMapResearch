depression,folh904,t1_folf4p5,1587862184.0,"I hate when people try to use what someone looks like to say they were ""asking for it""

I was wearing sweats, 2 shirts, a vampire cape, and a cowboy hat once. Its never about what ur wearing its about who they think will be the easiest victim. 

But anyways I'm so sorry we both had such horrible lives. So many people let us both down. Thank you so much for sharing all that with me, it really helps me feel less crazy."
depression,folalx5,t1_fol7xx2,1587858198.0,"No i can't even remember his face, he was my brothers friend. And by the time anyone knew i was 14 and my brother was either unwilling to figure out which friend it was or he just couldn't figure it out himself. But I've also never reported anyone else for their abuse. My cousin for example, she was the only person I tried to seek help from when the other abuse with my brothers friend was happening.... She liked that and molested me and sexually assaulted too. I didn't tell anyone about her till i was 19 but I never reported her and actually my family has encouraged me not to. Because 
""she's already in trouble with the law,"" 
""karma will get her eventually""
""You're both female and it happened so long ago so the cops aren't gonna take it seriously"" 

ACTUAL things they've said. 

But it took me a while to even want to report her because for so many years I only wanted revenge for what he did because it was sadistic. Where as her abuse wasn't. But that doesn't mean what she did was alright. Actually what she did was almost as bad and i just couldn't see it at the time. 

And yeah I think my parents don't believe im depressed because i was so good at acting like I was happy in front of them during the time of abuse  They can't wrap their heads around the fact that I was manipulated into protecting my abusers."
depression,fol6mss,t1_fol4kvg,1587855913.0,"Ig I've never thought about it as being abuse. As a kid i always thought our way of living was normal, didn't really understand how shitty it was till we moved. And when we did move my parents made up a lie about why we were moving it actually wasn't until last year when a different family member told me the truth. 

Yes we had cleaning supplies, my mom however suffered some brain damage in a car wreck when i was a baby and apparently she was never the same and never cleaned properly after that. My grandmother was the one who called CPS because i had a problem with yeast infections which everyone just thought was because of our living conditions or the type of detergent we were using. But then she called about it may being sexual abuse because she saw my vag and in her words "" it looked like someone was defiantly abusing me sexually"". Problem is she used it to accuse my dad. 
And my parents just thought my grandmother was being spiteful and trying to make stuff up so CPS wud HAVE to take me away. 

Oh and trust me i remember the infections and it was soooooooooooo Painful. I think i was getting them because my abuser wud abuse me and then I'd just stop showering out of disgust of myself. Which i understand makes no sense but i was really young soðŸ¤· nothing i did made sense. 

And yes my brother died. The last thing i said to him was "" get away from me you f*cking dope fiend."" 
Then he died hours later. Which has filled me with so much guilt and regret."
depression,fol3wpi,t3_g81k6w,1587854386.0,Like I've never been diagnosed so my dad refuses to admit im depressed or at least mentally unstable. But like how tf cud anyone go thru that with out help and be completely fine?
depression,fol3l6t,t1_fol1ywx,1587854205.0,"No they didn't abuse me, they just raised me in a dirty ass house and spent most of their time working or doing things to find fulfilment in their crappy lives ig?  CPS was threatening to take me away because I kept getting yeast infections, so my parents took my brother and I then ran to a different state. 

My parents were just too worried about themselves to see that I WAS being abused. 

I didnt tell anyone about the abuse till i was 14. 
My parents never got me any help. 
My brother started doing heroin. 
He tried to get me arrested for something HE did. 
He and I fought which had the police called and they condemned our house. We were homeless for almost a year. 
Then my brother called my school over my summer brake before high school, pretending to be my dad to say i wont be attending the next year. 
I showed up on my first day if senior year just to be told i was no longer a student. 
So i pushed my brother away and then he over dosed.  

But yeah my parents treat me like that, knowing all that about me.  So ig its emotional abuse of some kind."
depression,fokyo4z,t1_fokxaz2,1587851463.0,"My parents neglected me too, they provided the most horrible living conditions when i was a child. And yeah I've been abused most of my life too buy LOTS of different people but i usually only talk about the abuse i suffered as a child because it was the worse to go thru. 

And yeah I've always wanted to move far away, not because I hate my parents but mostly because I'm living in a room that I used to be abused in. A concept my father can't understand. Which is crazy to me cuz how can u not understand that? 

My problem is my parents make me feel bad for wanting to move, because the likelihood of me moving far away is high. Which is something I'm okay with, but they are not. They'll say things like
 "" all u'll be able to do is struggle without us""

Honestly i don't get why some parents of abused children are like this. It's like they want me to stay broken."
Paranormal,fjbfu9a,t3_fciizc,1583192343.0,"As a child I remember having a imaginary friend who lived in a pond that was a few acres away from my families property. I was never allowed to go in the water so I never did. But I'd sit and watch this little girl who lived in the pond pop her head out of the water in various places and giggle a bunch.  She never talked to me and I never tried to talk to her. It felt like I was just keeping her company. 

It wasn't untill a few years ago when i was visiting family in the area that I overheard my grandma talk about a little girl in her 1st grade class that drowned in the pond. I had never told anyone about my friend and it felt to much of a coincidence to have not been a ghost."

LetsNotMeet,fi57mg3,t1_fi50dhh,1582156737.0,"Im still confused as to why he thought I was smiling at him, I absolutely never did. Its like he liked what he saw and decided to make up an interaction to justify his actions. As if it wouldn't freak literally anyone out. It absolutely disgusting and makes me scared to just be in public."
LetsNotMeet,fi4wa80,t1_fi4vcpg,1582149719.0,"I've left messages with corporate and am currently waiting for a response. Its absolutely ridiculous, and someone shouldn't be allowed to do that.

survivorsofabuse,fi4knfl,t3_f6absj,1582143093.0,"I remember as a child that I was horrified of my abuser, and when I did ask for help from a family member they began abusing me as well. So obviously as a 5 year old I thought telling people would just cause more abuse. 

My friends mother was giving us the ""appropriate and inappropriate touch talk"" a few years into my abuse. I bawled my eyes out in front of them and absolutely refused to explain why. It wasn't till a decade later that I told her why I was crying. 

For me as a kid to a teen i went from terrified, to ashamed once I realized that I had let my abuse happen for so long by so many people. And I've struggled for many years with thoughts that my abuse made me the way I am, and I hate the way I am."

survivorsofabuse,fi4c0ch,t1_fi3weq3,1582138125.0,"I suffer from similar issues with sleep. I have horrible dreams, which causes me to grind my teeth at night. I just assumed those things could never be fixed, so I just pop a mouth guard in before bed. 

This might sound silly but I honestly thought there is no getting rid of the dreams. I thought therapy would just be picking a wound that my mind already picks at when I'm unconscious. 

This was honestly very helpful in that regard. Thank you for sharing."
survivorsofabuse,fi4b3ub,t1_fi38yzs,1582137607.0,"Thank you so much, I guess I've never viewed my life story like that. Being a highschool dropout with a 1 year old and no career is how I've viewed myself for a while. Its easy for me to think that I've made no progress when I compare my life to a friend's. 

However I must remember that my life has come with many hardships, and the fact that I'm not as ""successful"" as a normal person my age is not only okay but expected.

I've always thought setting such small goals was ridiculous, and that I should just be able to achieve ""normal"" goals. Which would led me to get frustrated when I can't or am not ready to complete certain life goals. I can't wait to try and set smaller and more achievable goals for myself. I feel as if it might actually give me the boost I need to get help. 
 
This was very helpful, thank you so much."
survivorsofabuse,fi30wih,t3_f5y2ej,1582096003.0,I honestly struggle with a similar issue. I had been abused for many years in my childhood and had grown accustomed to pretending everything was fine. It took me many years to tell anyone. Sadly I've never received counseling or help. Im not sure if I should just go back to pretending it never happened or if I should talk about it.
LetsNotMeet,fi2zwf4,t3_f4qsz5,1582094855.0,"OMG this has happened to me as well. Im 22, and like not the type that looks like a child. But I was walking to meet my boyfriend one day and no joke.... A guy pulled up in a van holding out candy and asking me if I wanted a ride.

And ran to my destination.  I don't understand if he just thought i was stupid or something."
