IAmA,fi0b092,t3_f5a4ve,1582032303.0,"hello, I 100% agree with your belief

""I firmly believe design can both improve the quality of life of those living with life-limiting or life-threatening diseases and their families, as well as play a role in shifting perceptions of hospice care.""

and have the same belief myself.

Ive been working as a design engineer for many years and have been trying to find a chance to get into the medical design side of engineering/design, with little luck currently.

what experience or qualifications did you need to get to where you are now? as this is exactly the sort of thing i'm trying to reach for.

many thanks :)"

I love your mini's, I've built my artificer using it, and as of yet he hasn't died in our campaign, so good times :)

my question is, why are you so awesome, stop it, you're making the rest of us look bad :)

but seriously, my question is...have you plans to work with wizards of the coast in the sense of making possible custom miniatures for monsters, or for when they bring out a new book with new races, that it ties in with your new releases. (come out around the same time sort of thing)?

many thanks

stay awesome :)"

careerguidance,fbytt42,t3_eexuks,1577226142.0,"I'm a 33 year old, in a similar situation, I've created something of a 5 year plan to becoming a biomedical engineer and to get myself back on track to where i want to be, i broke it down like this:

\- figure out what industry / type of work / profession you want to do, or you enjoy or are passionate about, as you will need to figure this out first as you will use this as your aim.

\- this will also be a good guide to figure out what things/actions/qualifications you would need and over what   
time period

 \- for your education i would say there are a few routes, which you take is personal preference

1 - if you find a job you are comfortable in that pays enough to live and pay for education, then there are places   
that  would do distance learning, i.e. learning you can do from home so you wont need to go into full time   
education.

(im in the uk, so i dont know if this example will apply to you but the OPEN university is where I go, and   
because its home learning the tuition fee's are less, although it will take a lot longer to complete, the OPEN   
universities link  [http://www.open.ac.uk/](http://www.open.ac.uk/) 

   2 - like your original idea, work a lot, but on top of that I would say to cut back on luxuries.

I would say be careful about working solid, as if you don't have a solid idea of what you are doing it for its very   
easy to get disheartened with the whole process 

  3 - if what you want to do offers an apprenticeship program, then look to that, it may be a lot less pay that the full   
time job but a lot of the time they will put you through training / college for the specific roles

\- try and speak to people in the industries, email companies, asking what sort of skills / qualifications they would look for in a employee (heads up, you'll probably get no response a lot of the time as they will see it as a waste of their time, but their are professionals out there who care about their professional communities)

\- job hunt in the industries that will give you some of the skills you need, even if its only one or 2 of the skills you need

\- keep yourself motivated, for me I find checking out latest discoveries in the industry, as well as exercise and dedication to my idea, its surprisingly easy to slip into whats comfortable.

\- for your CV there are job agencies out there that will offer you a free CV review if you want to fix your CV, worth having a search."
