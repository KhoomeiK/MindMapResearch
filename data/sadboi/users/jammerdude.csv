latterdaysaints,fqmrzws,t3_gjq71d,1589482549.0,"This is an interesting question, and one I have pondered often. The theory I have developed for answering revolves around tribalism, and the ongoing social competition for power (which is rooted in biology).

The example you provided about it being broadly socially unacceptable to discriminate against jews but acceptable towards mormons/catholics etc, is because the jewish community recently (relatively speaking) suffered the ultimate atrocity of what happens when religious discrimination reaches its full potential(referring to WWII genocide, obviously).

The thing to realize is that it is not hatred of the religion, it is hatred of the consolidation of power that occurs within communities organized around religion, that justifies the aggressor's behavior to themselves. 

Religious communities effectively compete with broader social institutions that are organized around other ideologies (like nationalism, to keep going with the Jews/Germany WWII example). 

To circle back to tribalism is what enables an ""us vs. them"" perception to occur, no matter how big the group size. In k-12 school, we see tribal identifiers form amongst natural friend cliques, extracurriculars, socioeconomic class, and even sometimes religions. This is something that only expands and iterates across a human family of 9 billion people.

Mormon culture is rooted in perpetuation of tribalism, as the dividing walls were originally necessary and beneficial to ensure the group's survival against the broader society competing for the same resources.

The hard part with tribalism rooted in religion, is that it's very nature is predicated on a source that cannot he reasoned or bargained with from outside the group (i.e. the group's deity), so the end result is a group of people that amass significant resources that could potentially outvote those who operate on a secular value system.

Anyways, this got complex quick, but I hope what i've said makes some sense (as it's just my theory, and I don't have time to go back
through and edit for clarification), but I find all of this super interesting and believe most answers boil down to fear or love. We fear outsiders, and love our own. And that applies to wherever identities associate.

economy,foilv91,t3_g7drtg,1587789991.0,"It just makes so much sense for income to be tied to time for people universally while they're here, a part of the system. In the democratic world order that exists today (as dictated by capitalism) UBI gives everyone a vote, but also allows for those who make better decisions (trade-value-wise) potential for more sway in correlation to the years they live. -- i.e. the elderly get more of a say (in terms of public capital voting), so long as they have made favorable decisions while building their life. Those who haven't, don't. It's like a capitalist's democratic replication of natural selection."
economy,foil2z2,t1_fohxius,1587789383.0,"Great question! The answer goes along with my comment about impact on inflation. -- Post implementation of UBI, it will take more money to incentivize people to do the (shit) jobs. There will still be people willing to do that work, but (arguably) it would have more of a reasonable labor market rate, appropriately paying in relation to societal value foe that work, rather than relying on it being done by the most financially desperate/biologically unfortunate."
economy,fohdolh,t3_g7drtg,1587764224.0,"The key to this whole concept, I believe, is viewing UBI as a beneficial investment for capitalism/free market, rather than a ""socialist spend"" with no backing. UBI allows us to raise the minimum societal contribution of a person from non-participatory (homelessness), to participatory in consumption - even if that UBI is only enough to cover essential/basic needs. 

It would certainly result in significant inflation, as the cost to persuade labor would be losing one of its foundational pillars (the threat of destitution), but it also allows the average person to now patron services from others at a much lower threshold, and would expand stability in the economy overall.

For example, I won't be so reluctant to pay my neighbor $50 to cut my grass, because I know $2k is coming again next month. If I want to do nothing with my new found time, I'm still contributing to the system by hiring my neighbor to cut my grass, because it's worth it to him to now have $2,050 per month for mowing my grass.

As long as I don't waste my $2k/mo on booze and drugs (thus still winding up homeless) I will have much better clarity on what sort of job I'm willing to take on because my NEEDS are met, and I can focus on doing fulfilling work that I WANT to do in exchange for money that I WANT instead of NEED in order to survive.

It's a revolutionary concept, but it is feasible to structure financially, and I believe could lead human society to a great new place if done right.

NPR just covered a story last night on how one human life is necessary to quantify in terms of financial value for the purposes of actuarial risk management. The researcher stated that the common figure currently used as human life value when calculating the cost-benefit analysis for infrastructure development investments, etc, is around $10M dollars. So... If we viewed every person as being worth a minimum of $10M at birth, $2k/mo by the time they are age 100 would only be $2.4M distributed to them throughout their life-time, with the remaining amount expected to be what they could earn throughout their lifetime.

Just spit balling ideas here btw - It's just exciting to consider that we could really be into something cool with this for future generations of humans."
stocks,fo5q5k2,t1_fo4wedx,1587532302.0,"You have to consider incentive. Yes, a CEO theoretically has incentive to manipulate short term stock price over long-term company gain, but having worked with a decent amount of public company execs as a financial advisor, any who have made it to that level of management usually care far more about their personal legacy than they do about their personal net worth in the short term. -- I think the equity capital market structure encourages legit value creation overall. You can find highly publicized examples of the opposite for short term, but for the majority of the market, the structure seems to mimic human interest (individually and collectively) reasonably well. 99% of individuals and entities with significant net worth manage their capital via capital market participation in one way or another.

Check out the allocation of bill and melinda gates foundation portfolio (relevant, given current levels of conspiracy criticism surrounding it) -- majority of the capital they use to fund exploratory projects comes from equity market appreciation alone. Almost zero return on their investments in direct research. I admit there is a division in perspective behind investor behavior as a ""have"" vs. a "" have not."" -- I assume it's the same M.O. for majority of publicly traded company execs/CEO's though.

CryptoCurrency,flexjb8,t3_fo8uj2,1585093552.0,"Typically, ""printed money"" is secured to debt issuance. This ""new"" money is still tied to the underlying function that makes the economy tick - trading. The difference is that it is on borrowed funds, which requires commitment/accountability for trading at an agreed upon value, and this is where our economy got into a mess the last time -- and likely will again thanks to student loans.

I'll use myself last year as an example of my first point.

Me: [M30], stable $50k/yr earner. I want to buy a house, I am willing to pay $100k for a house. 

House: *exists*. 

Trade Details: Current house owner bought house for $15k back in 2010, and has been renting it out for $400/mo. I offer him $100k for the house, which is enough incentive for him to agree to sell the property to me.

Both parties have agreed to the trade of: 1 House in exchange for $100k.

I then go to the bank, and (after completing an in-depth application process), am approved for a loan. The bank issues me a loan for $100k, backed by the U.S. Fed, which is used to pay for the house.

The seller now has a NEW $85k in his bank account ($100k -$15k original purchase price). I now have a house and mortgage balance of $100k, which I will pay off with $600/mo for the next 30 years.

-- Did the Fed ""print money"" in this scenario? Sort of.... But in all actuality, it was MY AGREEMENT to buy the house for $100k, and then MY COMMITMENT to pay back the $100k that created the new money entered into the economy.

The problem is... If something were to happen to me in the next few years (I lose my job, abandon the house, or I die) is the property truly worth $100k? or is the next buyer only willing to pay $15k? It is the Fed/mortgage lender who is on the hook for the difference now."

From my perspective, it seems like while your intentions are 100% good, and you might benefit from considering your motivations for the desire to go on a mission. (1) you desire to atone for your sins and (2) you want community acceptance, which are both admirable things.

Business, dating, and biology all produce reward through competition, and you grew up in an environment that has led you to develop a self narrative that you are unworthy to even compete in because you're a ""jack mormon"" and a BYU grad (but ""not an RM""!) No wonder you have struggled with suicidal ideation man!

I assure you, the strength you have developed by living in the gray is far more valuable to an eternal life and perspective than had you ""followed the straight and narrow,"" and never thought for yourself to examine life before coming full circle to appreciation of the gospel.

Speaking of which, part of your motivation to go on a mission being for it to serve as atonement in a way for your sins, is actually in direct conflict with the purpose of Christ.

Christ already paid the price for your atonement. There is nothing for you to earn (in an eternal sense). However, you must learn to personally appreciate fully what this means, how to embrace it, and then work to bring the reality of this into your present, and let it change you. If you can get there (continually), then you will have something truly unique to you, and worthwhile for you to share with others (which I suspect was more in line with the original noble purpose behind missions)."

The amount it (supposedly) has accumulated is enough to comfortably cover its current operating expenses for ~30ish years without needing to rely on additional tithing revenue. This is essentially the same position an average person needs to be in with their 401k/IRA in order to retire at age 65.

I know we are internet strangers, but please know I share in your sadness, and feel the pain of your loss. I am so sorry his life was cut short, and that you have to deal with this reality.

Remember that 1 year out is still very early in the process of figuring out how to cope and deal such a devastating loss. Be patient with yourself, and with life.

I am 5 years out from losing my brother/closest companion, and it is still incredibly hard. Something that gives me hope when considering that it may end up being a 60+ year journey of enduring without him, is the idea that by keeping his memory alive, and active in my thoughts, I have the opportunity to continue building my relationship with him in a way. This serves value both in my current reality, as well as in any hopeful life yet to come.

I do not know if there is life after death, but if there is, I know that nothing would make me happier than reuniting with my brother, and being able to tell him all the ways he was with me and still taught me things throughout my life. Perhaps he will even be able to do the same in return. What a beautiful thing that would be! 

On the flip side, if life is not eternal and we are never to be reunited, there is still great value (and perhaps even more meaning) in us working to keep their memory top of mind, and in our considerations throughout our lives, as it means we are now living for them in addition to ourselves!

I hope these thoughts help you in some small way... Wishing you the best my friend."

depression,fgiscxp,t3_eynwal,1580829841.0,"Man... You have every right to be furious. I'm furious FOR YOU -- and I'm a goddamn internet stranger! You have had so many unfortunate things happen, misassumptions about your character, personal betrayals, and traumatic experiences. You are strong as shit for dealing with it all man. 

I believe once you find your sources of security (financial, family confidence), you will form your foundation for climbing past all of this and you will have it all as incredible strength once you are through it. Find a way to turn the rage into productivity for your wins. You are clearly a smart guy, have just had shitty stuff happen to you. I wish you best of luck finding your way out. I really think you can. 

Control what you can control. One day at a time. Leave the rest for universe. You got this. 

Thanks for sharing your story. I hope TODAY is good day for you."

I was able to find hope through binding myself to the idea that both life and death (as we know it) serve a  purpose that transcends and benefits us (as well as our loved one) in ways we are incapable of seeing due to our limited perspective.

Best of wishes for you and your family with grieving. Let us know when you need to vent or could use positive perspective on anything."

Was the revocation accompanied by an explanation of how they believe it to be in your best interest, along with some sort of alternative action plan designed to help you work through your doubts?

I would think you having the courage to admit your doubts should be seen as an opportunity to help you feel understood, so the church could help address your concerns. Not punish you."

depression,feqjx7d,t1_feq8on7,1579342706.0,"There is still much to be explored my friend. If you have yet to experience the incredible impact that positive dating experiences and a good partner can bring into your life, you have much to be hopeful for. 

Rule #1 I constantly have to tell myself is DO NOT GIVE POWER to the idea that you are not worthy or capable of attracting a satisfying partner. IT IS FALSE, and NO GOOD can come from giving power to this idea.

Combat it by choosing to believe the following. Act on it in faith until the results prove to be true: No matter what your circumstances/limitations are, if you possess consciousness and have the ability to communicate, humans crave connection above all else, and there is someone out there who needs and wants you in their life as badly as you want and need them. You have skills in development, improvements you can make, and interests yet to be discovered and pursued.

Choose to believe you can shift your perspective with positive pursuits/intentions over time, and be open to allowing, seeking, and working towards the changes you care about every day. 

I hope some of this is valuable to you. Just some of the thoughts/beliefs I have adopted to continue trying and living."
