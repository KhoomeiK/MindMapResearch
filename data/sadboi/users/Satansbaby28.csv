Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fkm5cyn,t1_fkm5auy,1584321396.0,Do you have any legend or story related ?
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fkm40io,t1_fkjllef,1584320602.0,What’s a skin walker though?
relationships,fk1ogpb,t3_ffw9iu,1583783775.0,"I feel like all of this is just immature. You’re still fairly young. Live your childhood while you still can and take this time to get to know yourself first. 
Not meant to sound judgmental or rude, sorry if I did tho. 
Take care of yourself and have patience with yourself and everything around you!"
relationships,fk11rqf,t1_fk10xng,1583770710.0,That actually helps. Thank you so much!!
Marriage,fk0onb1,t1_fk0ifxs,1583762571.0,"Well I don’t worry about it and surely I don’t want this event to happen so soon but I was just wondering about it. Thank you for your answer, I appreciate it!"
relationships,fk0h9bb,t1_fjzp2r5,1583756895.0,"Thank you so much, I really appreciate it!!"
mentalhealth,fjzjd0s,t1_fjziw95,1583721109.0,"Oh, I’m sorry to hear that though. I appreciate you for what you’re doing for the people around and also proud you’re getting clean."
mentalhealth,fjziqq9,t1_fjzib8g,1583720693.0,I believe this is the burden of being like this but it also has its nice moments when you see the smile on the other person’s face. I feel proud when I can make someone feel better
Marriage,fjzifum,t1_fjzhxam,1583720487.0,"It’s also scary, I guess. Thank you so much, wish you all the best!!♥️♥️"
relationships,fjzi83g,t1_fjzhoaf,1583720342.0,I appreciate your honesty and your devotion towards your loved ones. I’m sorry though to hear that you feel lonely. I also sometimes feel that too and I guess everybody does sometimes but I hope you’ll feel better and find ways to help yourself a little bit more and maybe even talk about this with your partner. Thank you!
mentalhealth,fjzhs1i,t1_fjzhida,1583720033.0,"That’s my problem too, I just need to learn how to first.."
mentalhealth,fjzhngk,t1_fjzgndv,1583719947.0,"Well yes, it helped knowing what are the general problems and diagnostic. Usually my parents are cold so they don’t really get adusive, only my father when drunk but that’s another story. I don’t know though if I would still go because my studies don’t leave me any window of free time to actually work and pay for it."
Marriage,fjzh3qz,t1_fjzggx0,1583719578.0,Never really thought about this but you’re right. I too am really excited about the idea of receiving something from him that I would hold on forever. Thank you so much!
Marriage,fjzg6hh,t1_fjzfxpi,1583718966.0,"Yes, of course. He always says that he sees me as his future wife and I too. I guess I just want to make him feel special as well."
relationships,fjzg054,t1_fjzboyw,1583718848.0,"Well that’s what I’m used to, I don’t really know how to be the ‘star of the show’ and I don’t really feel confident about it but I appreciate this. Thank you!!"
mentalhealth,fjzfm5y,t1_fjzbiq4,1583718586.0,"I’m sorry to hear that tho but just know you’re not alone! Also, if you want to talk, I am a good listener and love helping."
mentalhealth,fjzffnc,t1_fjzclld,1583718465.0,"I have been to therapy for a short time, saving money for it but then my parents found out and they were mad because they thought I hate them because I can’t tell them my problems. Also, thank you for this. I really appreciate it!"
mentalhealth,fjzbip0,t3_fffuhg,1583715846.0,Congratulations!! You should be proud of yourself because I already am! Be patient! The greatest gift is to love and be loved so never stop from doing it!
relationships,fjz9ve3,t1_fjy8ma0,1583714729.0,"How do you feel about that, about the behavior. I am quite the same with my lover. I always put him first and if there isn’t place for my needs, I just push it down and hope it would vanish but sometimes I wish I could just do whatever I want but I always think about his needs and his safety or wants and never focus on my personal problems or mental issues. I would like to know how it feels for the other side in such situations."
Marriage,fjy4n5l,t1_fjy499a,1583689741.0,Well I guess we’re not really traditional. We’ve been ‘fake proposing ‘ to each other like just asking ‘do you want to be my husband/wife’ and then we would laugh but I don’t know.
ghibli,fjjhw3w,t3_fdg49r,1583396813.0,This is my favorite movie of all time and I’ve always wanted to see a cosplay good enough and I think I’ve just found it. I love it! Absolutely adorable
Minecraftbuilds,fj8nh15,t3_fc3zsu,1583117514.0,Love it. Excited to see more of if!
