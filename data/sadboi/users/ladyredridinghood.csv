childfree,f6m7mho,t1_f6m11vd,1572967953.0,based on my doctor told me I'd recommend having your tubes out instead of tied because the risk of developing ovarian cancer is apparently lower if you have the tubes out.

childfree,f6ljaoq,t1_f6lj8n0,1572948223.0,Exactly. The only emotions I have are towards the fact that I still don't have a diagnosis for the pain that I'm in. I had the tubes removed during exploratory surgery to figure out if I have endometriosis. No answers so far.
tattoo,f6lj8ec,t3_dqls0j,1572948116.0,I found an artist I like and I have two cover up jobs. I don't know if she does cover-ups. What would be the best way to approach asking her? Should I email a picture of the tattoos that I'd like covered in addition to what ideas I have and see if she's interested in doing the cover-ups? Or should I just ask generally does she do cover up work? Thanks.

BipolarReddit,f62z6ye,t1_f61g0kq,1572669193.0,So the first time I went up to 100 mg on lamictal I became manic for 2 months. So we dropped it back down. However a couple years later I started to spiral really badly and became open to trying to put it up again and this time it worked. I'm now at 125 and I plan to keep going up as long as I can tolerate it. I'm not as stable as I want to be yet.

childfree,f5pu2we,t1_f5pu012,1572367788.0,Thank you! There's also a chance that it won't be safe to take out the tubes. I won't know the situation until I wake up.
childfree,f5ptooy,t1_f5poert,1572367538.0,I'm still gonna need birth control probably. The whole reason they're going in to begin with is to see if I have endometriosis.
childfree,f5on7mf,t1_f5on56k,1572323351.0,I thought it could be something like that. Also maybe it's weird having a part of myself removed. Although I've already had my gallbladder removed.

I see doctors probably four times a month at the least of varying specialties. I'm in physical therapy for pelvic pain likely related to the possible endometriosis I have. I see my psychiatrist once a month and my psychologist four times a month. I get a cortisone injection in my ankle every 3 months to help deal with the arthritis from an old injury. By old I mean I did it in 2011. A triple spiral ankle fracture that I've had three surgeries on. Now I have a permanent partial disability rating in that ankle because I don't have full motion back. That injury is on the same leg. I have had a lot of lab work done. All results have been normal so far. I started taking lamictal 5 years ago. I'm having exploratory surgery at the beginning of November because they think I have endometriosis. Recently had a CAT scan of my abdomen and about to have an endoscopy because I have a hiatal hernia they need to check on but I've had that for a long time. CAT scan was normal. Also had my gallbladder removed 2 years ago. I'm just throwing out medical stuff because I have no idea what's relevant."
