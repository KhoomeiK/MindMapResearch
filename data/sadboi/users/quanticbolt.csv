HealthAnxiety,ffqp67g,t1_ffqo1t0,1580140384.0,"Same here! It's annoying because we both know how low the chances of that are. But you know what? You're right, it could happen. Which is terrifying. 

A trick I learned in ERP is to actually sit down and write out the probabilities of everything that would have to go wrong for the plane to crash. You'll see a small number. And sure, that doesn't mean it won't happen. But I like to think about the probability that I end up with as an approximation of how much energy I should put into thinking/worrying about the plane crashing.

So if the probability comes out to like 50% then I put like 50% of my energy worrying about the plane crashing. If it's 25% then I put 25% of my energy into worrying about it. For anything lower than 1%, I'll put like 1% of energy into worrying about it. It takes practice, but I try to take that as my rule of thumb now. Do I struggle though? Absolutely. Anxiety is tough.

Again, it's definitely the sitting with the discomfort part that's the worst though."
HealthAnxiety,ffql5n8,t3_euocvf,1580137554.0,"Hey, I hate flying too. It's an HA sufferers nightmare because you're basically trapped without any outside help for however long you're in the air.

I actually flew from India to London and then from London to Toronto recently. That's about 17 hours of total flight time. Was I panicking, sure? But I made it out fine. What really helped me was that on both flights there were medical emergencies on board. Here's what stood out:

The flight is fairly equipped to handle most standard medical issues. One elderly woman had an unusually high blood pressure, so they quietly moved her into business class and gave her some medications. Another elderly man had a similar issue and was also treated. They were both fine.

The second thing which stood out was that everyone who did have a medical issue onboard was fairly old (i.e. people who definitely already had a medical history). It's hard to believe for us, but when you're fairly young and in moderately okay health (even if you're not a complete gym rat), the chances of something catastrophic happening is fairly low. The worst part is sitting with the discomfort.

It may help to realize that most people on flights aren't even aware of things like DVT, etc. They just sit through eleven hour flights without getting up once because they're clueless. And I'm not talking about young people. I'm talking about 70 year old grandmas doing this shit. 

The most important thing is to prepare yourself for the discomfort and all the associated physical symptoms. Something which another Redditor suggested to me was to kind of plan out an itinerary of your flight. Something like, ""hour one: we're in the air and I'm watching a movie,"" because this helps normalize what's happening.

As a final aside, people with horrific medical conditions fly all the time and are fine. My uncle had a heart attack a couple months ago, had a stent placed at some sketchy rural hospital, and flew economy to a bigger hospital three or four days after the stent was placed to have more procedures done. He's fine. Maybe a bit tired, but fine.

Haha, sorry for the long ass paragraphs. I hope your travel goes decently okay, even if it's not the most comfortable time. Best of luck, friend."

Is there a nice way to do that (i.e. not using quotient rule)? And then I take the dot of that guy with x\_a to get h\_ab? and then I can construct my matrix (but just rewrite everything in terms of u,v with substitutions)?

And actually, even if I compute X_u' and X_v', sure, I can compute g_u'v'. But how would I compute h_u'v'? I'm particular, what is n_v'? Is it uxv/|uxv| since this is perpendicular to both u,v and u' is dependent on both of these? Moreover, after finding (g_u'v'), how would I find the inverse matrix (g^u'v')?
