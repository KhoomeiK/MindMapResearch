I do need to get a sleep study, probably an at home one bc corona. Are they expensive ?"
SuicideWatch,fo5s4ez,t3_g1afy7,1587533967.0,"I am sorry you are dealing with this, I can imagine that you feel trapped and powerless and suicide seems like an easy way out. I am in a comparable situation. I am 19 years old and feeling trapped and struggling to figure out what to do in life after suffering a moderate brain injury and recovering very slowly. My father was abusive, and I was raised in a very restrictive religion. I am now dead broke and have an abysmal quality of life. I often feel trapped, and think about dying, because at least then I could have some peace. What helps me, and what I want to tell you, is that the hand you have been dealt in life has nothing to do with your merit. You deserve so much more than what life has given you so far, and the only way to fight back, and take the life you deserve is to live and persevere in hope of a brighter future.

It might seem like there is no hope right now, but what if you catch a break next week,  next year, two years, or even five years from now ? would it not be worth it ? if you end your life now, you will never know. I am aware that this is the generic advice of "" things will get better"" but a life is truly a terrible thing to waste, especially  at our age because our brains are not even fully formed. It is better to give life a try before throwing in the towel. I made a pact with myself, which prohibits any suicide attempts until after I turn 25, and then If I still feel like life is bad enough, whatever happens happens. This might get me down voted, but honestly, it gave me some peace of mind and I feel sort of off the hook, if that makes sense ? It's like acknowledging that suicide is an option if things get absolutely unbearable, but also postponing it (possibly indefinitely) so that there is a chance that things can improve. You can always die tomorrow, so why not live today ya know ?"
longevity,f30rkob,t1_f30d72h,1570560865.0,"Even if we did discover a way to achieve an infinite lifespan, it is impossible to escape entropy. You could not  control for every single event that could affect your life and potentially end it. There is no way of knowing whether or not a war, a super bug, a natural disaster, an accident, depletion of resources etc. will eventually kill you, and the longer you live, the more likely it is that you will face some life threatening event within your lifespan. Even if you don't die from environmental causes, the planet cannot sustain life forever, and even if we manage to colonize other planets, the universe will eventually cease to exist in a form that is hospitable to life as we know it. We would will still have a limited time to achieve our goals, we would just be able to achieve grander goals due to having drastically more time than a standard human lifespan. I think that most of people would agree that 70-80 total years and maybe only and handful of truly good years is not really enough.

While some people may resort to depression, apathy, lunacy, perversion etc., a lot of people would actually obtain  meaningful lives by dedicating themselves to various pursuits. Imagine what some of the most productive and intelligent people in history would have been able to do with an eternity ? Imagine what they could have learned and achieved.

If immortality were possible, everyone would eventually reach a point of peak satisfaction with their lives which could never be obtained without sufficient time, so obviously a fulfilling lifespan would vary wildly between individuals. A competitive, narcissistic and goal oriented individual would probably attempt to be the best at as many things as possible for as long as possible, while an intellectually obsessed scientist, musician, artist, athlete, actor, etc. may become absorbed in his/her particular field and be determined to make a breakthrough, set a record, or invent something new. People who obsesses over achieving specific goals would likely tolerate a much longer lifespan than a less ambitious person who might become dissatisfied and aimless sooner. An infinite lifespan would allow more people to reach their full potential.

My point is that while I agree that conquering mortality could render life meaningless,  I think that in the real world, we would still technically be mortal even if we had infinite lifespan. Life would still be precious and fragile, because there is always the chance of an untimely death, which is why it would still make sense to ""have sex today"" instead of in 1,000 years. There is no guarantee that you will not be struck be lightning within the next 1,000 years.

Also, the skills and knowledge amassed by people with such enormous lifespans could potentially be an incredible contribution to society, so even if a person grows complacent and discontent after a few thousand years of life, their knowledge and skills could make a profound impact on the world, so their life would still not be pointless. If the human lifespan was uncapped, and we could somehow obtain enough resources to sustain an immortal population, life would not be perfect,  but it would be much better in my opinion, and a lot of the problems we face as a species would be solved."

Nootropics,eyf1oz7,t1_eyb64w5,1567042141.0,"I'm sorry that happened to you. NAC is kind of a wild card since the cysteine can complex with Hg and cross BBB. I noticed it seriously exacerbated my brain fog after a week of use. Be careful with chelation therapy as well, It seems the only reliable way to remove mercury from cells and brain is ALA or Emeramide. Regular chelation therapy is risky unless you have high blood levels. 

Selenium at high doses can also greatly reduce the toxicity of mercury.  [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24734306.2017.1392076](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24734306.2017.1392076)"
