AskReddit,fpquv4b,t3_gexhgi,1588832921.0,"I was abused and bullied throughout high school and two of my bullies (not the worst, but still) who just had a baby apparently had long thoughts about all of the horrible things they did in life and apologized to me. I went through several years of therapy due to what was partially caused by them. To hear that they were genuinely sorry for the cruelty they threw at me helped me to recincile with my past and overcome some of the hate I had harbored for them. I am truly grateful to see people grow from their mistakes."

AskReddit,fhkcqhl,t3_f3i60f,1581678095.0,"As a hostess t 17 I had some guys that had just gotten off the submarine (a thing that happened every 7-13 months) asked me to bend down without crouching to pick up some menus that had flown on to the ground. One particular guys said ""I'll give you an extra $20 if you slowly reach down for that menu"". I was just confused and shocked and reported it to my manager, but apparently this conduct was expected of the submariners. 

Not to me, but to a early bloomer friend, we were trick or treating around age 11. Our friend's drunk dad said ""hey sexy mama, how you doin?"" After 2 drinks (he was around 43). Unfortunately, she was hit on quite intensely and uncomfortably from 10- present due to her early development and mixed skin tone. Honestly it opened me up to how disgusting and horrible people could be because I was just an undeveloped white girl around her and saw the extreme difference of harassment due to reasons beyond her control. It related to a lot of psychosocial issues she developed later on too which was even a more depressing factor of our sick fetishizing American culture"
