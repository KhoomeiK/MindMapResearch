They literally sent me home not knowing what I have and told me I'd be fine because I'm young I mean wtf. They guessed a skin disease and that was it. Risked my life there for nothing and now have had a dry cough for days :( yeah all the old people looked miserable it was so horrific my minds still disturbed."

depression,fmje29p,t1_fmicxob,1586128446.0,"They guessed I had a disease basically and injected me with dangerous drugs I didn't need for 5 days and wouldn't listen when I told them it was making me worse. The doctor told me I'd die if I didn't take them which was bullshit and then sent me off overnight close to covid patients in a ward where no one knew wtf was wrong with me after doing various blood tests. When all they had to do was send me to a skin specialist, which I asked them to do and they refused. Told me I'd have to go back to A & E again after a week of suffering. And they treated not only me but all the old people there like garbage, one old lady called pearl was screaming all night and day when they came up to her. I felt awful and wanted to help they just told me she was crazy which I doubt it. It was literally a hellraiser hospital of fucked up inbred doctors/nurses. The nurse ripped my IV out and bandage off and it was so painful then mocked me for being afraid. Then she told me I was dirty for wearing my mask/hat/glasses and gloves. Told me how I was spreading more germs and how I would get sicker for doing that (yet she had no gloves or mask on herself and another doctor mocked me for wearing a mask told me i was being paranoid how they weren't wearing any). I basically told her to fuck off and refused to take it off my face. It was a nightmare."

Not one family member contacted me, they still haven't and I'm home now there really is no excuse fuck all of them. My mum had shingles recently but it looks like something worse on my legs. Well the doctors had told me there was no covid 19 patients at first so that's why I agreed to stay but then an x ray man told me they were there in isolation on my ward somewhere so that was scary as fuck. I heard an old lady screaming for help all night it was horrific. Also a lot of coughing outside my hospital door, I had a mask on that they kept trying to get me to take off which was fucked up.

There is a lot of spiders in this house and we have seen very large ones before in the attic (could of been brown recluses) but the doctor told me seeing as I live in Ireland there is no dangerous spiders here. He might be wrong. This all started off as tiny hard painful bumps that got worse over time. Here is the first stages of this weeks ago. 

 [https://i.imgur.com/1FxkWGf.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/1FxkWGf.jpg)  \- it began like this one small bump that looked like a bite mark.

 [https://i.imgur.com/2nFm9s5.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/2nFm9s5.jpg)  \- Then the second leg looked like a bite mark it was a small dot to begin with but both got bigger and bigger. 

 [https://i.imgur.com/IDyxfWi.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/IDyxfWi.jpg)  This was all early stages when it was tiny and didn't seem that bad

But over time the rash has just spread and gotten bigger which worries me, I am anemic and do have spider veins with numb feet/hands sometimes not sure if this would have anything to do with it."

Just blood tests/a chest xray they didn't tell me much about them, one doctor said he seen inflammation from the bloods but he told me he really didn't know much. Then the first doctor had guessed it was cellulitis and gave me heavy IV drips but the second said he was wrong. They checked my blood pressure/temperature every few hours and they were fine so I'm completely in the dark and afraid.

Do you think I should go to a private dermatologist for answers?"
AskDocs,fm51tu8,t1_fm0mhh4,1585764768.0,He didn't. He told me it was cellulitis when it wasn't and gave me an IV drip that has wrecked my legs :(

AskDocs,fm4ubzm,t1_fm1cv0g,1585760957.0,"Hello thank you for messaging, so this doctor issued me 5 doses of IV drip which was strong every day without fully knowing if it was cellulitis or not. My feet have been huge since I have taken this medication by drip and raw and in extreme pain. I got back again from hospital today he literally told me to stay over night because he thought I would get sepsis. So I was sent in to stay overnight in a ward very close to covid 19 patients.  And today a different doctor said it was most likely not cellulitis as he couldn't seem to find an infection in the blood stream only inflammation. Seeing as I was issued the wrong medicine completely do you think my feet/ankles/legs have been damaged for life with this? (the swelling is still very bad and painful and a strange color) I'm very afraid and honestly upset he would of issued this without fully knowing what we were dealing with."
