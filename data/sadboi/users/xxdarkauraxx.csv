SuicideWatch,fn5j4ts,t3_fzok39,1586666263.0,"some people are diagnosed with depression. for an example, i come from a decent family. i have it good but little did i know i was diagnosed with moderate depression. I would go to the doctor and get diagnosed. it’s the only proper way to found out really."
twentyonepilots,fn5gbx0,t3_fzoqgj,1586664122.0,self titled is by far my favorite album. it speaks to me like no other album has. it has an older sound to it. like nostalgia.
twentyonepilots,fn57nk7,t1_fn57iw4,1586657900.0,this also helped me overcome my suicidal thoughts.
twentyonepilots,fn57iw4,t1_fn56z90,1586657808.0,"i’ve always been taught to choose between right and wrong because i was raised in a subliminal society. When doing this, i found myself going down a dark hole that was depressing. But the line, “don’t be afraid of what ur soul is really thinking”. This line changed me because i started to believe in what i wanted. In what i thought was better for me. I then began to realize that everyone else around me was wrong about how life is supposed to be lived. Not to brag or anything but i was 2 steps ahead of everyone because i knew what i wanted. Them on the other-hand were living a lie which and them unhappy."
twentyonepilots,fn54pz9,t3_fzlf8z,1586655872.0,fall away by twenty one pilots. it’s underrated.
twentyonepilots,fn54gkt,t3_fzn2df,1586655696.0,"their song isle of flightless birds has warped my whole view on life. it’s too much to explain but i do gotta say, it’s underrated. Also, self titled has spoken to much like not other album has."
twentyonepilots,fn53o89,t3_fzdawo,1586655164.0,i have a love hate relationship for this idk why
twentyonepilots,fn53mef,t3_fz8r5y,1586655130.0,who else was singing along
twentyonepilots,fn53igr,t3_fzmy28,1586655055.0,yeah it’s been 2 years since trench released. their album releases are every 2 years. expect trench that was 3.
twentyonepilots,fn53ebv,t3_fzliwn,1586654978.0,"tyler was like “hey guys! look how much my hair grew during the quarantine!” 

The clique: “we don’t care”"
twentyonepilots,fn537hk,t3_fzihog,1586654849.0,we can all agree that everything AFTER number 1 is trash. twenty one pilots will remain elite.
twentyonepilots,fn533j4,t3_fz7sgt,1586654774.0,"i agree. tyler and josh created the single Heathens for the Suicide Squad movie and for the storyline of Trench. He created a song that fit both narratives. That’s what their singles are for, it’s like a starter point for the next era."
twentyonepilots,fn2ht1y,t3_fyu0p2,1586589515.0,i thought u were tyler for a second. what a bop tho. ur voice compliments the music.
twentyonepilots,fn2hps4,t3_fyp2e2,1586589420.0,everything thing after number 1 is a blur. twenty one pilots will remain elite.
SuicideWatch,fn2h33q,t3_fyw3pt,1586588768.0,i don’t know when was the last time i cried. simply because i don’t have the energy to do anything anymore.
SuicideWatch,fn2gsvd,t3_fua0n1,1586588478.0,"i’m having this mindset right now. i think suicide is the easy way out because simply, i didn’t want to try to better myself. But once i attempted to, nothing worked out because not every method to eliminate works. Right now, i’m caught in the middle of the heat. I want to eliminate but i can’t because it’s not as simple as it seems which wares me out. i’ve been ok lately but once this quarantine is over and i have to face everyone, it’s going to get worse."
SuicideWatch,fn2fkw7,t3_fr9ofe,1586587264.0,the quarantine has been the best thing that’s happened  because school and people is the core to my suicidal thoughts. being tucked away in my home has allowed me to take my anger out on something else instead of my self. like drawing and writing poems.
WatchPeopleDieInside,fn1bm2i,t3_fygzr1,1586558671.0,i laughed too hard
AskReddit,fmzxg5q,t3_fy2j5o,1586531502.0,listen to all the twenty one pilots songs. the theory’s will keep you up all night.
twentyonepilots,fmz6h0r,t3_fy8xbg,1586508285.0,"i despise when my friends don’t listen to what i have to say about twenty one pilots. but on the bright side, u have a whole family on reddit. :)"
twentyonepilots,fmz4kn2,t1_fmy8aon,1586506154.0,i’m happy you wrote this. it got me thinking about their new song level of concern and how tyler writes music he wants to hear but isn’t out there. that explains why nobody can pin point the genre of the music he writes.
