We need to be very skeptical of anything that we read on any mainstream content sites (Facebook, YouTube, Reddit, etc.), especially the ones that rely on advertising revenue.

You are what you perceive. Letting others influence the input entering your mind will change your output in ways that benefit them, and it will be difficult to recognize until you practice seeing things for what they are.

When major events happen in my life like a new job, that's when the series ends and a spinoff begins, since the best TV shows have only a handful of seasons.

Each ""season"" typically involves me undergoing a transformative character arc, like how in my final year of university I had to come to terms with leaving the life I created in the last 4 years.

During the off season before season 4, I had a dream that was apparently a sneak preview of S4E1, and in it Jimmy took a job at a retail store in a different city to avoid his guilt over Chuck's death and to run away from himself. But soon he realizes that he can't escape his past, so he returns to ABQ.

It was pretty surreal watching him work at a cell phone store and avoid his true emotions for most of season 4, until the end where he finally embraces his true self.
