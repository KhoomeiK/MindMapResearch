I've always felt like the dressmakers really care and want me to be 100% happy with the dress -- I've never felt like ""just another sale"" or a commission number.

I don't have any experience with your seller, but I did notice that many of the photos in the reviews look liked they weren't taken by a professional photographer -- which I feel like helps you get an idea of what the dresses look like IRL.

Different games, different programming, different optimizations and methods. Oblivion is the awkward inbetween of trying to get to Skyrim, but the capabilities didn't exist yet. Trainwiz said something similar to this IIRC.

Additionally, the Skyrim modding community is huge. There are mods with downloads in the literal millions. Of course there are tons of resources. For Morrowind, the community is fairly tight-knit and incredibly dedicated. Some modders (Like MelchiorDahrk) have been modding their game for *literally over a decade*.

oblivion,flqfhrd,t1_flprexk,1585392588.0,"I have one! Quest mod that I think will be simple: ""Relevant Mages Guild Recommendations"". In vanilla, most of the recommendation quests are fitting. You use destruction magic in Skingrad, Alteration magic in Cheydinhal, etc. This is not the case for Chorrol or Anvil. 

Here's the mod: the vanilla Chorrol and Anvil recommendation quests become open to the public. For Chorrol, Teekius got a report that there's a scamp on the loose in the Oak and Crossier basement. Some conjurer lost control of it, and it killed him. Luckily, they were able to barricade the basement, but they need someone to take care of the scamp. This doesn't require magic, but it does teach you about the dangerous of conjuration magic. Conjuration magic needs to be respected.

For Anvil: Either cure some people at some tavern somewhere (maybe the one near Kvatch), or turn the Ghost Ship of Anvil into the recommendation quest. Haunted ships and crystal balls seem pretty ""mage-y"" and Carahil hates the undead more than Earana hates Teekius. In vanilla, Turn Undead is a conjuration spell, but there's a lot of mods that move it to Restoration already. 

I feel like the Leyawiin recommendation quest could be open to the public, but I'm not sure what I'd replace it with. I think it kinda works though, because Dagail's condition is like a warning about the dangers that Mysticism magic can have.

politics,fjl1wz1,t1_fjkvm6v,1583438326.0,"I'm a little confused by this. 

We're currently on the [brink of shortages already](https://www.aamc.org/news-insights/press-releases/new-findings-confirm-predictions-physician-shortage) (location dependent).

Medical professionals are [frustrated and burnt out from the administrative overhead](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/why-are-so-many-doctors-burning-out-tons-of-real-and-electronic-paperwork/2019/05/31/3335ca78-346c-11e9-af5b-b51b7ff322e9_story.html). Of which insurance companies are a big factor. 

What's wrong with private practice? A doctor is a doctor, regardless of where, right? Private practice is also appealing because money. You know why doctors need money? To pay student loans, which currently average $200,000.I don't think undergrad debt is included in that. And then there's also the opportunity cost of attending medical school. If only there was a way to ease the financial burden of student loans..."

relationship_advice,fhmbo7j,t3_f3v8mb,1581710781.0,"Oh, hey, I'm trying to get out of your wife's boat.

For me, my drive died because of PTSD from assault. The longer the relationship went on and the more committed we became, the lower my drive went, because the more devastating it would be if he also assaulted me. Therapy helped with that aspect of it, because there's a LOT to unpack there.

Another factor was feeling pressured. Given my background, I'm hypersensitive to *any* kind of perceived pressure, real or not, and I'd shut down. Judging from your post, your wife seems to be under a lot of pressure from you and herself. What helped me and my fiance there was explicitly putting me in control and I'm the only one who initiates now.

My therapist also recommended non-sexual touch and masturbating. Make sure you hug and cuddle with your wife with no pressure/expectations. Masturbating might help jumpstart things too.

Another thing that helped me is that my fiance compliments me more and is more romantic. He calls me beautiful, buys me little ""thinking of you"" gifts, we go on dates, etc etc. 

Best of luck"
PokemonRMXP,fgjwr97,t3_eyxbrt,1580852893.0,"That's a neat idea! I like your rationale.

I'm sticking with Nintendo's typing, so I'm not sure if this would work, but: What about keeping your idea of normal > fairy, but also making a ""null type""? No pokemon would actually have this typing, but moves like tackle, body slam, and such (that 90+% of pokemon can learn) would now be ""null"". Null-type moves are not strong or weak to anything and no STAB. Some moves, like pay-day, slash, boomburst, etc would still be ""normal"" type.

This way, there will be much fewer normal type moves, so fairy types won't be crippled (and having ""Tackle"" be super effective against anything seems a little silly). And you'd be able to keep the idea of normal being supereffective against fairy. I really like that idea, it really spruces up normal types."
pokemongo,fgj1m55,t3_eysegu,1580835253.0,"Hmm. It looks like I'm probably one of the people you're complaining about.

First, different shinies have always had different values to people. You can pry my shiny GO umbreon (a community day ""trashiny""!) from my cold, dead hands. My shiny wurmple in Ruby? My shiny koffing in Platinum? Shiny Patrat in White2? All those other ""legitimate"" shinies I've gotten over the years? Don't care.

Second, you seem pretty upset over what people name their shinies and how you think they're treated. How do you know that people treat their shinies ""like a fighting slave without feeling the slightest affection""? Is it because they ""slap stats onto the nickname bar""? Is convenience naming and affection two mutually exclusive things? My best pokemon in GO is a Vaporeon convenience-named WG|HP (I pronounce it ""Whigulp"") and she's so great that I'm going to use Vaporeon for the first time in a handheld pokemon game. She's great, and having a convenience name doesn't mean I don't like her. It means I got tired of opening the menus to figure out which pokemon had which moves or who had max whatever.

And ""storing shinies for fighting"" -- it's Pokemon GO, what else do you do with them? There's no Contest Halls or other kinds of stuff you can do with them. You can buddy with them and you can fight with them. That's all. Is it better to store them for fighting or would you rather people store them in a collection and never use them? Which is better off: my un-nicknamed shiny umbreon who anchors my GL team that I use regularly, or Octavia the Pidgeot who hasn't seen the light of day since late 2016?"

I updated the lighting. Used the same values as one of the other houses, added some lights, and updated the nexus page.

And sure! Sailen is the least likely of the bunch, since you can take over one person's house after doing a quest. But I'll give Akamora a go :)"

But overall, I don't think it answers the question in the title. I feel that **all** the pros for eloping (1-6) also fit with weddings too. You can make your wedding about you, you can have a small wedding, you can have a nontraditional wedding, etc etc. It also seems like elopement =/= wedding, yet the words seem to be used interchangably by the end of the piece. I didn't understand the difference between an elopement and a nontraditional wedding."
