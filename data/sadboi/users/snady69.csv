bipolar,fqmm2ae,t3_gjd0ur,1589479695.0,"I'm feeling like I'm at the start of hypomania since the past week or so and its making me feel super paranoid and self conscious. I feel like when I get super excited and talkative everybody is annoyed with me and I notice myself doing it and think everyone secretly is wishing I'd go away. Its making me really insecure and I feel like after being diagnosed, I can no longer enjoy anything. I just think that everyone is watching me be the way I am and thinking like wow what the fuck is wrong with her"
bipolar,fqmlk75,t1_fqlg8vh,1589479449.0,"Oh my god I've been struggling with this so much. I'm so afraid to tell anyone, especially my boyfriend, because in afraid of having all of my actions brished off as some kind of episode or that im just being crazy. Im afraid of trying to communicate issues or things that im upset about and just being brushed off as mentally ill."
bipolar,fqml8ys,t1_fqke9zz,1589479298.0,"Omg lol. Ive been feeling like a hypo episode is starting the past few days and my roommate had to stop me from buying a ton of plants at lowes yesterday. I did wind up buying a ton of seeds, but I think thats quite alright."
bipolar,fqd0adn,t3_gi23kp,1589275144.0,Over the past few days I felt my depression lifting and i was getting bursts of energy and starting to feel like deep cleaning and going for long walks at night. Last night particularly I had so much energy I just sat down and worked on a coding project for 10 hours straight until 6 am. Using that energy helps me feel productive during this quarantine and also keeps me from using it to do dangerous stuff. Totally agree with you!
bipolar,fq9062b,t3_ghbkb6,1589180956.0,Just wanted to clarify that I wasn't talking about gender identity (my fault for bad wording) but I would love to hear about any experiences with unsurety in gender identity with you BD as well! It can be so confusing in so many aspects. I specifically struggle with my identity in relation to my moral bounds and my values.
bipolar,fq865o8,t3_ghb5iv,1589159287.0,I feel often that the things I've done when having an episode are just piling on bad karma. I do feel like its some kind of punishment that I do things that go against my morals and then have to live with them when I'm back in a different headspace
bipolar,fpfhpzv,t3_gd59l1,1588571587.0,God I feel this so much. Its so hard living with all of the crazy shit you did and having to play it off to other people so it doesn't sound like you're crazy.
bipolar,foet92k,t3_g6pzi0,1587713974.0,Wobbly by Ezra furman-its more about gender but I always just identified with the feeling of wobbling up and down
bipolar,foes3dj,t1_foerg9t,1587712848.0,"Yeah, my counselor is a really nice guy but he isn't a psychiatrist. I've been off the lexapro for almost a year and have definitely noticed way more depression which I think makes sense to me given that lexapro is generally used to treat depression. Immediately after going off the lexapro is when i think the extremely elevated mood happened though. Ive noticed primarily just sort of a destabilized feeling in terms of mood like lots of mood swings and large shifts in mood. I'm definitely thinking of a second opinion. I have to move states very soon so once I'm settled in ill try to set one up. Thank you for your opinion, it helps to hear it from others who actually experience these things."
misophonia,fjkoumr,t1_fj1xbl7,1583430978.0,"They always have some embedded video of chewing sounds that autoplay or a bunch of horrible photos lol. I also have trouble reading words associated with eating and every time they talk about ""lupus smacking"" it makes me physically uncomfortable (sorry if that bothered anyone)"
misophonia,fiozdjr,t3_f8xty1,1582594536.0,"I had a medical single first 2 years. Gave it up to move into an apartment with my friends. Worst decision i ever made. If you can get that single back, do it."
misophonia,fi1w61j,t3_f1y14u,1582066021.0,"There is generally something really specific about someones chewing that bothers me. You can ask her what specifically it is. It might be something really weird and she might feel weird telling you but it could really help if you discuss it. 

It could also be the silverware on plates so you could switch to bamboo utensils. It could be heavy breathing out of your nose while you chew. You could try taking smaller bites so you arent breathing so hard while you chew."
misophonia,fi1vsnn,t3_f57bke,1582065801.0,I purposefully chew so that I make essentially no sound. I usually avoid eating in places where people can see me and never continue to eat when I'm the only one left eating. Sometimes when I'm alone I will try to loosen up and let myself open by mouth but I feel so gross and disgusting doing it I still make an effort never to open my mouth.
misophonia,felka5u,t1_febej68,1579224207.0,"Not sure why the posters comment was removed but I have the hearing aids so I can explain. (I specifically have the Widex Evokes). The ones that I have are programmed with whatever I choose with my audiologist. I have one setting of white noise and then the other settings are the randomized fractal tone melodies. So the hearing aids act as sound generators instead of using a microphone to amplify surrounding sounds. They just play these random tones in a nice little chiming melody that will never repeat. 

They're cool because they dont block sound like ear plugs do. You can still hear conversations and your environment and what not. They're just adding extra sound into your ear to add some other noise to focus on. You may be able to turn the volume up enough to block out the person chewing gum 10 ft away but still be able to hear the conversation you're having. Or maybe you can still hear the gum but have enough extra stuff going on in your ear that you can sort of pull away and try to focus on that instead."
