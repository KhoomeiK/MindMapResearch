BPDsupport,ethduej,t3_cbov0h,1562812770.0,I have these same issues. I'm 23 a college dropout due to bpd and struggle staying employed. I always tend to get suicianpn the job or blow up from the little things I never address. Ot would be great to just feel nimble at work but I feel everything else and cant fully control my emotions. It's so damn difficult. No one in my family understands why I cant keep a job so they blame me for being lazy or selfish or a leach. It's crazy how some people just fail to accept your truth. You being 27 has given me so much hope and confidence that I can make it and succeed. Please keep your head held high and dont let your circumstances trouble you. There are ways to get through anything even of it's hard there is still a way. Where there is a will....you know the rest lol  praying for you always. Dont give up.
BPD,ethd6q1,t3_cbm1yw,1562812266.0,I fucking love this group. Bpd is so tough to fight alone I read this page every day. Thank God for the internet cuz whew! I'm not alone.

BPD,esn4dla,t3_c8ig5s,1562122296.0,I'm in the same boat and no one seems to understand. I haven't hept a sold job for more than 6 months. People expect me to form these life long relationships working in retail. I dont understand how to connect with people on such short notice. I dont have the energy to give my all to every face I see. Emotional I'm not available and i check out. Being consistent has been my hardest battle. Emotions all over the place.
BPD,esn3n8g,t3_c8eyhw,1562121781.0,Your bpd buddies are here for you! We understand how draining this can be. Please dont do anything we need more people like us so we can relate.

Watch this. It helps people with depression identify their emotions. Me having both BPD depression this helps me a lot to not blow up and get angry. If I can identify my emotions on a scale. 

Give it a try!"
