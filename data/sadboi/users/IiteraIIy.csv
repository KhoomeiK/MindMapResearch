The short answer: Both. Depression can be caused by a genetic imbalance of chemicals in the brain. It can also be caused by trauma, or learnt through repetitive behavior. The neurons in your brain carve a pathway every time you have to deal with something, and that pathway gradually gets deeper and more ingrained every time it happens.

I'm a lesbian myself and I could not fucking get through this movie. It was all over the place, seemed like the plot was completely improvised and there was no planned arc.

It ends with another character blackmailing the protagonist (who is also a sociopath murderer) into... being her girlfriend, and then after being ""seduced"" into sex, the protag strangles her to death *while sleepwalking.*

Anyway he threatened to hack my steam account but he logged the password I used to log in to my computer, not the one I use for my steam, so the only password he knew was the one for getting into my laptop. I unplugged my wifi, ran malwarebytes, turned it back on and the malware was gone. On Skype he tried to get me to redownload it by sending it as an exe file, I don't know why he thought that would work.  He pulled me into a group dm with a bunch of his other friends and they all started making fun of me, until I told them I draw furry porn (a lie) and was promptly removed from the group.

You play from the perspective of slugcat but there's a *lot* more to Rain World than just slugcat. You could go straight to the end, but survivor's story is a very small fraction of the story of Rain World in it's entirety.

In most post-apocalyptic games, a big factor of what gets players interested is the mystery of ""how did this happen?"" and Moon is the first step to finding that out. I would suggest following the yellow overseer after you meet her, and saving any colored pearls that you find.

Spoilers below, to explain your other questions:

>!Moon gets you on the road to Pebbles, who gives you the mark of communication, and as well as bringing pearls to Moon and having her read them to you, giving her more neurons gives you a bit of unique dialogue to information about how things got the way that they are.!<

>!It's all for player interest and speculation. When it comes to Moon reading pearls, she's not telling a truth or a lie, she's simply reading something someone else wrote. The only way for her to be ""lying"" while doing this is if she's intentionally saying things that aren't written on the pearl, which you'd only be able to find out if it directly contradicts something you can see yourself. As for Moon's unique personal dialogue, it's mostly about what happened between her and Pebbles, which you can prove by finding conversation logs between them, as well as Pebbles admitting to it when you visit him as Hunter.!<"
