truechildfree,fbu47je,t3_ee8l0j,1577107346.0,"Here are some of the reasons I personally have chosen not to have kids.   


1 - There are so many kids in the foster system currently that don't have a loving family and have to pack their things in trash bags as they move from home to home. It's rather funny how people try to push others to go through a personal, physical process of bearing children while there are so many children in need of love and support and family here already. Almost as if adopting or even fostering is taboo or something. 

2 - There is already a large population on the planet and I don't see how my choosing not to have kids is going to end the human race. Yes, I've actually seen the argument where people worry that humans will die out if all humans do not procreate. 

3 - I personally know I'd be a terrible parent and I believe I'm sparing potential children a miserable childhood by simply not bringing any lives into this world. I love when I tell people that I know I'd be a terrible parent and they always try to counter with platitudes like how I'll surprise myself and I'll do better than I think I will. Um, okay. That's why there are so many stories of people struggling with mental illness because they grew up with narcissists as parents, or addicts who never got help, or parents with other mental illness that was undiagnosed or untreated. I've even read some stories about parents who never wanted kids and did the bare minimum for keeping their kids alive, healthy, schooled, but were never present for them.

The idea is that it is very possible to love someone else even if you can't love yourself and, if that person truly loves you in return (and isn't abusive or anything) then it is possible through being with them and being treated the way you deserve that you begin to love yourself and your perspective changes and you grow.

relationship_advice,ewxe3rq,t3_cp4etj,1565853979.0," I think your dad's comment kind of sums up everything here. ""The venue doesn't matter just the person you're marrying."" It takes time, money, and work to plan a wedding. You were juggling finishing school with planning your wedding. They expect you to just give up the work you put into your own wedding at the whim of your sister simply because she happens to be pregnant? Uh uh. If the venue doesn't matter, than wouldn't this also apply to her? Why is this your fault? Spoiler alert - it isn't your fault. Your family are definitely the assholes here and so is your sister. It was extremely unfair to put you on the spot like that, especially after agreeing with her fiance that she wouldn't do it. She sounds very spoiled.

Don't change anything about what you're doing. Either your family will come around, or they simply don't deserve to share in one of your most joyous days. Congratulations on graduating and I hope your wedding is lovely. May it be a beautiful day and occasion."

childfree,evmt022,t3_ckbcup,1564612826.0,"I feel like the ""need to continue one's own bloodline"" is egotistical considering the population of the planet and the number of kids without loving, safe homes. Though I'm child-free, I get that some people just really want to have a baby. I can understand the desire to want to feel what it's like to be pregnant and give birth and raise your own child. That's one thing. But to breed for the sake of keeping your own bloodline alive like you're some super-important being to the human race is just plain ego.   


I could be wrong, but that's how it seems to me."
prochoice,evj6041,t1_evhw14h,1564556128.0,"I could be wrong, but I think OP is talking about some of the laws enacted in certain states like Alabama and Ohio(?) where the 11 and 12 year old rape victims who became pregnant are now unable to access safe, legal abortions to end their pregnancies. I believe in one of those cases, the rapist was even granted parental rights? Or perhaps that was another story I'm confusing.   


Those are laws but they are far from moral. That was my takeaway from OP's comment, anyway."

MadOver30,eva4brl,t3_cisfb7,1564338507.0,"I read a story once about a man in India or China. Where he was is unimportant. If he was real is unimportant. What's important is the takeaway.   


The story goes - There was a rice farmer who injured his ankle and couldn't work. Upon recovering, he went back to working his fields only to find that the work was excruciatingly painful and he could no longer tend the fields. He became depressed. Town physicians came to evaluate him and determine what was wrong. They realized that his depression began after he got hurt and realized he could no longer tend his rice patties. So, instead of medicating him or providing therapy, they brought him a cow. The man was able to care for the cow and milk the cow, etc. Gradually, his depression lessened as he had purpose again.   


My question to everyone is this - Do you think it's possible that something in our currently lives or in our current society is causing or maybe simply aggravating depression? Do you think it's possible that, for some at least, having the opportunity to figure out a change that's needed in life and be able to make said change could alleviate or get rid of depression?   


I've been thinking about this off and on since I read the story a while back and while I know very well it's not a fix for every person, I believe the idea has merit."

Maybe because I've been on the other side and know that those people are wanting to go home and may even have had a rough day? Maybe that's why you felt weird, too? It seems like everyone has worked retail in some form at some point in their lives. It's just too easy for some to forget what it's like. :/"

My favorite is when those kinds of customers start with the ""you don't understand customer service, the customer is always right"" blah blah blah.   


I had that happen at an old job when this older couple came strolling into my work literally five minutes before we were supposed to close. There had been no customers for at least a half hour before that. Generally, you can tell when someone is coming to pick something up real fast or just killing time. These people were the latter. Meanwhile, we were forced to keep the store open longer for them to walk around for 15 or so minutes and buy absolutely nothing, all the while the lady kept telling us we were horrible associates for telling her the store was closing in five minutes. Because, you know, we don't want to go home, have dinner, get sleep, spend time with our family or anything like that. Customers are so entitled sometimes."

I would also like to say that it's not easy to accept new information and actually change one's mind. Sometimes, it takes a personal experience to make the information one has learned to really sink in, hit home, and make you go ""Oh THAT'S what they were talking about!"" Good for you for being open-minded enough to accept the information and allow it to change your mind even if it took time to do so.   


Better late than never."
