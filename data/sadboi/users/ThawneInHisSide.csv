FanTheories,f0mnkn2,t1_f0mi8e3,1568749038.0,"Hey thanks, You too Bruce! 

Basically Kreia is kinda right, the force has existed and as long as it is practiced it is what basically the entire universe revolves around. 

The Sith fight the Jedi. The Empire fights the Rebels. Everything that happens in Star Wars comes down to prophecy and cemented fates by an unseen force (so aptly named) that seems to use people as puppets. It has the ability to manipulate minds, hearts, cheat death, all of these things it is able to do but more importantly the 'Force' seems to have a will of it's own.

Basically it means the thing everybody is fighting over, The thing that everybody wants a taste of or gives praise to and wishes to follow it's 'plans' in whichever way they deem it get tethered to this eternal war of this sentient power that just seems like it will never end. 

You can't even escape it in death with Ghosts and Spirits seemingly coming from the force itself (thus 'Force Ghost' and the aura/appearance etc). It basically bounds you to it's will permanently and all you can do is deal with it. 

But Kreia saw the Sith almost got it right, almost. They could use it for their own desires and treat it like one would treat their body which is why Sith Alchemy and the like has so much emphasis on the self and your own abilities. Darth Bane noticed though that this just ended up making power vacuums and constant bickering and I think Kreia did too. The Sith's approach to 'tame' the force was a noble one but they became addicts to the power and usually end up either going straight up Darth Nihilus and are barely what they once were or go mad and warped with power. 

So the conclusion is basically you can either follow the will of the force and do as it says or become a spooky red eyed lich. It's why I also think her apprentices clung to life so much as they were legitamately concerned about what happens to them once they become 'One with the Force'. Do they cease to exist? Do they just follow a thing now even if it is not their goals? Why even try if everything is preordained and planned?

So Kreia tried to find a way to basically kill the Force and finds the Exile and Bingo! There ARE ways to wound the Force. That's very important and very powerful knowledge. If it can be hurt it can be killed and finally the world can be done with these constant battles, meaningless existence and lack of true freedom. 

In other words - To save the Galaxy from itself, The Force has to die. 


If I could write an AU story I'd probably have that the Force literally accumulates souls and raw emotion so the eternal war is how it 'powers' itself. It's why, in my opinion, Force Nexuses are usually places with a LOT of emotions/death tied to them because the wars The Force starts are there to heighten it's abilities and with the more places where these epic battles have been the more Nexuses open, the more that open the stronger it grows and the further it's reach. 

Everytime a Jedi uses a mind trick, It gains a little here, Every soul lost battling for the force is another victory, every sith is pushed into becoming an emotional wreck because emotion is tasty. It's like an Eldritch being that is incomprehensible and unable to be seen. It's also why I think Miralukans and Kiffar could have been waaaaay more useful if KOTOR 2 didn't just turn Kreia into an evil monologue at the end of Malachor V but had her explain her philosophy and reasoning as opposed to ""Force bad. Time to blow this up.""

But y'know it's Star Wars so hey that won't ever happen haha"

-I had a theory before ROTS that Padme was going to pull a face-heel turn in ROTS and be what finally breaks Anakin (She reveals she didn't love him, he's just powerful and Sheev wanted him to be in on their plan to create a united Empire.) So she's not a villain but rather is aware that the Galaxy needs to be united and more ruthless because...I dunno, Vong?

-She gives Anakin a 'Join me and together we can rule the universe' line which mentally breaks Anakin. She's killed by a Jedi and is the catalyst for Order 66/The Purge. (By the big sad I guess, It was before ROTS so I didn't have any idea) and Anakin serves Sheev because he truly believes in what the Empire stands for/His love for Padme
