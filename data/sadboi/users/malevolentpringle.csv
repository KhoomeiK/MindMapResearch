It was known as the 'Danglefoot Seagull' incident and it still haunts me."

BPD,f45swb2,t3_dji4t4,1571393834.0,"That's ok! They sound like a really supportive partner the way they are happy to sit you down and calmly talk through the issues (as long as they don't make you feel TOO bad about it and want to work with you towards improving, not just putting you down)

 I know it sucks to come to terms with your own behavior but try to focus on the positives and be reflective but not too self deprecating! So many of us are in the same boat, we hear you <3"

BPD,f45skbr,t3_djfxra,1571393347.0,"I relate with this a bit too much, it's so worth trying to maintain a good balance because if used incorrectly you can end up making very impulsive decisions that are difficult to deal with later. Do you have any good tips on how to manage it? 

I find that anger is a really easy emotion to go to when dealing with trauma because it makes you feel in control. I definitely let myself slip back into it if it looks like I'm not coping, I know it's an easy out."
