diabetes_t2,fi7gl2f,t3_f6obt2,1582220988.0,"I had my first low, 75 a few weeks ago and it was awful. It came a day after my Ozempic injection. I now know what it feels like and how to get it up pretty quickly."
diabetes_t2,fi5ady6,t1_fi58a2w,1582158551.0,I had stomach pains that do eventually go away. Constipation stays but never any nausea. Iâ€™ve been on 1 mg up from .25 for a few months now.
InstacartShoppers,fhroare,t1_fhrmg9u,1581832304.0,I hope that is not the case for you.

mentalillness,ffea1mg,t3_eswj84,1579840877.0,I often wondered how I could be so funny yet depressed. I read about what you mentioned. We donâ€™t want others to feel sad. Our humor also masks our sadness.
InstacartShoppers,ffdm7hq,t3_esx8ni,1579823852.0,I agree!!
diabetes_t2,ffaufxd,t3_esltqx,1579744747.0,Hi. Iâ€™ve been on Ozempic for a few months. Iâ€™ve lost my appetite and about 25 pounds so far. No bad side effects other than a bit of constipation. For me the cost is the only issue I have with it. Feel free to ask any questions.

prozac,f6g8rvx,t3_dr6eac,1572823171.0,Iâ€™m up to 40 mg now and my sleep is better but I wake up multiple times a night also. No shaking here but I do clench my jaw constantly. Overall my symptoms are not bad enough to stop taking it. I hope you find some answers.
prozac,f693oit,t3_dqpldz,1572734888.0,"Anger here also.  I believe itâ€™s because Anxiety isnâ€™t as controlled with Prozac, for me anyway.  Iâ€™ve taken a separate med for Anxiety and I stopped with the anger issues.  The problem was I couldnâ€™t take the two together. So I was told to choose whatâ€™s worse for me, the depression or anxiety. I choose depression and Iâ€™m now on 40 mg of Prozac.  You are not alone."
