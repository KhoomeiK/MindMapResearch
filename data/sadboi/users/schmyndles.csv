depression,fpx0lrb,t1_fpww1jf,1588973406.0,"Thanks for responding, I’ll try to answer what I can here.

My physical issue is a sleep disorder, similar to narcolepsy, where I’m constantly exhausted and can sleep for days straight if left alone. It messes with my brain too, like how if you went a day or two without sleep you’d have trouble thinking, memory, etc, that’s my baseline. It’s gotten noticeably worse the past few years, I was actually questioning whether I had dementia or something because I would forget coworkers names, how to do simple math, words I’ve known for decades, etc. So not only does it mess with my daily life, it’s a big hit to my self-esteem.

My addictions were to alcohol and heroin-I was an addict for 12 years, most of my adult life, so I’m a lot farther behind in life than others, plus all that contributes to the cognitive issues. I last used the night of May 9th, 2016, when I tried to OD and end it all-I woke up the next morning with the needle still in my arm, and my mom pounding on my door saying a spot opened up at rehab, and by the grace of God I haven’t used since.

I thought getting clean would help my mood, and it did, for a bit-I was floating on the “pink cloud” of sobriety. But then my mom moved away, my sister moved in with me and she hates everyone, especially me, and my boyfriend relapsed on heroin. I struggle with standing up for myself and setting and keeping boundaries, so at home and at work I get walked all over. I’m so tired all the time that it’s hard to go out and make friends, and most people in my city drink so they all want to go to bars. My coworkers go out drinking all the time, and even though I know they don’t ask me cuz I’m sober, it’s made me the outcast, like I can go the whole day without anyone saying hi to me.

I’ve been on many antidepressants, and I’m currently on Effexor and Wellbutrin, as those are the two that don’t cause more sedation. My depression wasn’t as bad it seems when I was self-medicating, as I would at least have changes in my mood, instead of this constant Eeyore-like anhedonia. I’ve had a lot of therapists, although almost all female (like me), and there was only one who really pushed me. Unfortunately she moved away and I have no idea where she is now. That’s why I figured using the online thing would be better, as I’d get assigned a therapist based on my needs, but I guess I gotta figure something else out now. At least I’m too demotivated to do anything, including making a plan to kill myself, so that’s a plus, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t think about it every day."
Hyperhidrosis,fpwilhp,t3_g4jn2e,1588964092.0,"I got this for Christmas, and it’s made a negligible difference. It’s hard because your skin has to be clean and dry to apply it, so I wash and dry as much as I can, put it on, and a minute later I’m sweating again so I’m sure it’s not working as well as it could be. Also I’m not great about using it every day. It has lessened my sweating from dripping off of me to just beading on my skin, so it helps in that regard, but I’m never actually dry.

I’m also not good about using it regularly. But I did notice that the amount of sweat from my face has lessened a tiny bit. I used to have beads running down my forehead and dripping onto everything, and now I’ll have sweat but it’s not as drippy I guess. I’m sure if I was better about using it correctly it might work more, but I doubt it would stop me from sweating completely. And I don’t know about any other areas."

They still get their $2.33/hr wage, and I believe the employer is required to make up anything short of minimum wage, so $7.25/hr. But that’s a huge paycut to pretty much every server out there.

So if they are still offered 40 hours per week for work, but there’s no customers to serve, at best they get minimum wage, and have no options for unemployment."

I had to get ten of my baby teeth pulled because they wouldn’t come out, then 4 molars to make room in my mouth, and my four wisdom teeth. 

I went to a teaching university for my braces and it took almost 6 years. I got a new orthodontist every year, and was lucky to have almost all great ones (not gonna lie, the last girl was kinda a bitch). I had the things to widen my jaws for a couple years, til they gave up and just pulled the four teeth. And I had the permanent retainers put in the top and bottom front teeth, but the end of the bottom one came loose like a week later, and the mean orthodontist said I wasn’t taking care of them and took the bottom one off, and gave me a removable retainer which I lost after like 5 years. I still have the top one 20 years later though, and you can see the difference, my bottom teeth are pretty crooked again (tho not nearly as bad as they were), but the top are still great.

I know this is a bit late,  your pics caught my eye because you kinda look like me (or a younger me at least), then I read your comments and found it interesting we had some of the same experiences (I even face planted on my bike when I was 8, but luckily only ended up with a chipped front tooth and a fat lip).

birding,fol0066,t3_g46mvg,1587852201.0,"Hi! I live in southeastern Wisconsin, USA, and have just started birding last week! Started with a Northern Cardinal pair I noticed outside my window, and I’ve become a bit obsessed since then. I got the eBird and Merlin ID apps and have already ID’d so many birds I’ve never noticed before around me. Some of my faves have been a Killdeer pair, a couple Blue Jays, two woodpeckers (one Downy, and I think the other was a Red-Bellied Woodpecker), and a brown creeper. I’ve also seen the aforementioned Cardinal couple (I’ve named them Marty and Wendy Byrde, as I’m watching Ozark right now), a few European Starlings, an American Crow, a pair of Mourning Doves, a Brown-Headed Cowbird, Mallard ducks and Canada Geese, some finches and sparrows and nuthatches, and a bunch of Robins. I was really excited to find two different woodpeckers on the same walk, one right after the other, as I’d never seen one before! My young nephew and I have been going on adventures looking for birds almost every day, and watching out our apartments windows for them when we’re at home.

One thing I wanted to ask you guys is if anyone has a recommendation for like a cheap iPhone lens to be able to take better pictures? I’m just using my old 5s, and my pictures are, well, crap. I was so excited when one of the Blue Jays actually stopped on my tree long enough to take some pics, but you can’t even see the blue, it just looks like bird.

I keep saying I feel like I can take huge breaths, but there’s no oxygen in the air. If I’m active and this happens, I’ve had times where my vision goes black and I just have to stand and hold myself up on something to keep from falling. I don’t feel like my inhaler helps much, either, besides forcing me to stop hyperventilating and concentrate on my breathing, so I’m not using it much anymore. My chest pain is worse when I breathe in also. I feel like it’s not as bad now, but i suspect I’ve just become used to the constant pain and don’t notice it as much. The sinus stuff is weird too, it’s like I have rubber cement blocking my nose all the time and I’m constantly trying to clear my airways, which sounds gross, but I really can’t get any air through my nose at all. I picked up some nasal spray which does help, but I’m trying to only use it when it’s super bad.

I’m a homebody most of the time, but my SO is always out and about, and had been at the casino for hours the weekend before I got sick also! He said it was packed, too.

I always joked that no viruses could survive in my blood stream, and that I never had cavities because the vodka killed the bacteria. Now I haven’t drank in 4 years, my teeth are just falling apart, and I’m sick all the time! 

A woman I work with, she’s in her late 50’s and a long-time smoker, she was really sick in February too, negative for flu and was told it was just a virus. She’s sure that it was Covid now, although I’m in a central state in the US that didn’t start getting cases officially until March. Another two women at work both had bronchitis/pneumonia in December too, and one thinks it was Covid and everyone is lying about when it started. Because of those two being sick I had gotten my pneumonia vaccine in the first week in February too, plus had the flu shot last October. That’s what really scares me with my lung issues, I had a vaccine for pneumonia, so if it isn’t that, and isn’t Covid, then what the heck is going on?"
COVID19positive,fnxkeod,t1_fnxhf4z,1587340472.0,"Yeah, I tried explaining that to my boss, but it didn’t work. My boss/HR didn’t even want me calling in for the symptoms I had, just for fever, and to come back to work after 3 days without fever. I had two weeks vacation saved up that I used to quarantine myself, and called HR the last day saying I still had symptoms and should I stay home, and they said I could work. Unfortunately, I’m the only one in my house who still even has a job (my bf and sister both got permanent layoffs), and we needed the money, so I went back for two days, but everyone freaked out on me when I would start wheezing and gasping and grabbing my inhaler every hour, and I felt awful. Then called in another 4 days, worked two days, called in 3 days, worked two, etc. 

We have two plants, about a half mile apart, and the other plant has had two confirmed cases, and shut down for a week after each one, but sent a bunch of their people to my plant to work. They also laid off about 100 people, for 3 weeks, and I really thought I’d be in that group since they said they needed the people who were going to show up every day to work. But no, I wasn’t that lucky, at least then I could’ve rested and gotten unemployment. Starting this week, they now are disciplining people who call in, unless they have a positive test (my boss thinks anyone can just walk in and get tested), they are taking our temps as we walk in the door, and are requiring masks and one person per table at lunch. But it’s assembly, so we pass a part between 3-5 people, who are wearing gloves that they probably haven’t changed in hours, and we constantly have to move down next to others and its impossible to maintain 3 feet between each employee. 

So I’m doing the best I can, now with the stimulus check and unemployment coming in it’ll be a bit easier, but I can’t risk losing my job over attendance, and I don’t have any more time off until October. Took me two years to get those two weeks, I was gonna visit my mom this summer, but that’s not happening anyways so I figured I’d try to get better in that time, but it’s not working out like I hoped.

Plus I could only take two weeks off from work, and my symptoms were still there, so idk if I was contagious at all, but without a test I can’t get time off. I try to work as much as I can, but I have such a hard time breathing sometimes I feel like I’m gonna pass out, and I’m still expected to now work ten hours a day. It’s ridiculous."

Last month, March 16th, I had this chest pain that I assumed was heartburn, but it hasn’t gone away since. It varies in intensity, usually below my sternum, but sometimes I’ll get pain in my upper right chest area, too. That same night started shortness of breath. I’m okay if I’m just sitting, but walking around or even holding a conversation is difficult. This has also not gone away since.

I took two weeks off work, using vacation pay, just in case I was infected. I didn’t have a thermometer to take my temp the first few days, first temp I got was the highest that Friday, at 99.5. Had a couple more 99 readings, then back down to normal. Was able to reach the nurse hotline on Friday, March 20th, and had a telephone appt with a nurse practitioner the next day. Because of my lack of fever, and no travel or contact with someone infected, I was advised to stay home for two weeks and keep my albuterol inhaler handy.

Since the symptoms started, I’ve had other minor symptoms that come and go. For the past two weeks I’ve had more sinus issues, stuffy nose, etc, and feel like something is stuck in my throat I can’t cough up. Also have had headaches and fatigue, and had diarrhea a couple days before the chest pain and breathing issues started.

I’ve been going back to work, but only a couple days at a time as it exhausts me (I work a physical factory job) and I struggle to breathe a lot. Plus everyone looks at me like I have the plague. We all are wearing masks but that just makes it even harder for me to breathe.

I do also live with three other people in a small apartment, although I’m the oldest and most unhealthy, but no one else has had any symptoms. None of us have been tested either.

I’m just hoping someday there’ll be a way to know if I have Covid, as I’m kinda worried about what it might be if it’s not! I wanted to make a record here I guess if my symptoms, and see if anyone else is going through something similar."

I nonchalantly said wouldn’t it be nice if there was universal healthcare in this country so she wouldn’t need to worry about that? She said she doesn’t trust Bernie Sanders, I asked why and she said “because he’s a democrat, and I’m Republican all the way, baby!”

I asked what Republicans had done for her lately, and she mumbled something about paying less taxes. So I asked if it would be worth it to pay more in taxes but not have to pay her health insurance premiums, deductibles, etc? I mentioned how I figured out I would save $2500/year and since we make about the same amount of money she’d also save in the end.

I had one person, when I tried explaining how the safer-at-home orders help keep our hospitals from being overwhelmed, tell me I’m just trying to scare people.

When I was 23, I was a waitress third shift at a diner near the college. I had gotten Bell’s Palsy, where half of my face was paralyzed for a couple months, but I still had to work, so I tried not to smile so it wasn’t so obvious. This group of college kids came in, and one must’ve been the funny guy, cuz he asked me why I wasn’t smiling. A girl in his group told him to knock it off, as I mumbled something like I can’t, but he persisted to the point he wouldn’t let me take anyone’s orders. So I gave him my biggest, toothless smile, and he literally jumped back into the booth with a shout, then loudly said, “What are you, retarded?!?”  My face fell flat as his friends began apologizing for him and admonishing him.  I explained to the girl what was going on, but the guy didn’t hear me, so he probably still thinks I was some sort of monster working there.

When I was 19, I was at a family wedding. I was in line for the buffet with my brother, and one of my uncle’s was next to me. I go to grab some food and he says, “Maybe you should stick with the salad.” I had put on a little weight my first year in college, but this guy was 400 lbs so I really didn’t feel he had any right to judge me. My brother told him to shut up, and my uncle decided to mention how my dress made me look like a whore (it didn’t, it was a nice dress, with a sweater over it). That’s when his wife smacked him in the arm and told him also to shut up. That uncle was always mean to us because he had dated my mom originally, she came to the bar he worked at one night waiting for him to finish his shift, and my dad (his brother) was there drinking, and they hit it off and left together. But that was 25 years before this, so you’d think he’d be over it by then.

My last one happens a lot. I’m in my mid 30’s now, but never had kids because I couldn’t. I love kids, especially my nephew, so I get asked all.the.time.why I never had kids. I don’t get mad about it cuz I know people mean well, but it still sucks when I say I can’t and they keep pushing about IVF, etc, and what a good mom I’d be. It’s so much easier when they say “Oh” and change the subject."

I would think anyone in a leadership position would try to deter public gatherings with what information we had, but a lot of them care more about money than lives. Hell, Trump was still gathering [large groups](https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-what-trump-was-doing-as-coronavirus-was-rapidly-spreading-2020-4) of supporters into March, and he knew more than any of us.

What I do know is this-Our country needs leadership right now, they need truth and transparency, they need egos set aside for the greater good, and they need a cohesive narrative from our government. Trump can tweet “SOCIAL DISTANCING!” a million times and it won’t matter if he’s not leading by example to his followers. He can have his daily briefings forever, but if his narrative is changing each day, people will give up and just believe what they want to believe. Without coherent leadership, the general public will be fearful of all the unknowns, and that’s when people become reckless and selfish. The less people follow CDC guidelines, the more deaths there are, the longer and more restrictive things will be, the more the unemployment goes up, the lower the stock market gets, the more people will panic and the more our country will fall apart. And then you’ll be wishing toilet paper was your greatest concern. 

Half the country was barely making it before this started, and our leaders, who are supposed to be making the big decisions to help us get through, are too busy fighting and stonewalling and gaslighting to get anything done. Half of America has a President who acts as if their lives are worth less than his ego (just don’t add them to the total if it makes him look bad). And the other half has spent years convincing themselves that leaders, scientists, doctors, and experts are all part of the deep state and are lying to them (unless it’s something that makes Trump look good). Is it any wonder no one really knows what to do, I mean, you and I have had a few comments back and forth, and I still can’t figure out if you think this pandemic is serious or not.

In case you don't, just in January 2019, 129,032 simply ARRIVED in the US, daily.

Yeah, that’s why the travel restrictions on China were criticized. Because they would’ve needed to start earlier, before anyone in the US was positive, and because we would’ve needed a full-on ban from everywhere, not just non-Americans from China.  

The xenophobic part was because it still allowed Americans and their relatives to fly into America from China, and didn’t restrict any other countries which had already shown spread of the virus. I believe one of the biggest concerns was that some people in the US would hear about the China travel restrictions and take it to an ignorant and hateful place in their minds, which could lead to stigma or even violence against Chinese-Americans, or even Asians in general. That by saying an American in Wuhan can fly to New York, but a Chinese person can’t suggests that only Chinese people can become infected with the virus...obviously the virus isn’t screening people’s citizenship before infecting them, but we all know how illogical some people can be.

> Seems that Dems are trying to push this as a Bubonic Plague level event, when it's not. It's mortality rate and critical care rate are still low. It's a cold, harsh truth, but  160,000+ people die (which is more than COVID-19 has killed, in total), every day. Does it suck? Yes. Will this be the end of humanity? No, not even close. I'd be shocked if this kills even 1% of the world population.

I don’t think anyone’s trying to push it as anything more than what it is, but that there is so many unknowns involved that it’s easy for people to get confused, or spread rumors and misinformation. 

Does it suck that people die in drunk driving accidents? Of course. Does the fact they aren’t 100% preventable mean we shouldn’t do anything to prevent them? That we shouldn’t punish those caught driving drunk, or inform the public that drinking and driving is dangerous and could kill you or someone else? 

The main points that I’ve seen pushed (obviously there are always outliers) are what we as individuals can do to slow the spread, as having even 100 extra critical care patients would overwhelm most hospitals. If those same 100 are spread out over 6 months instead of 6 days, it’ll be manageable. The virus spreads easily, people are contagious for longer than other diseases, there’s more asymptomatic people unaware that they’re carriers, and it can live longer on surfaces. That’s why there’s constant information being pushed about washing hands, cleaning more used surfaces, not touching your face, staying away from anyone else, etc.  Yeah, lots of people die every day. But now we have more people dying on top of that large number, and for some crazy reason, most people go out of their way to avoid death, or long hospital stays, or weeks of sickness and being unable to breathe, or people they love going through those things. If nothing was done, if there was no information given, everybody would panic as they watched those around them getting sick and/or dying, and there’s be bigger issues than finding toilet paper on our hands. 

> Should have linked something that actually was going into the gene structure or classification, like here or here, which goes into explanation on the exact make up of the different corona viruses. So, I'll stand corrected, but only because I found the info, not because of yours. Yours is just talking of symptoms. Which would branch across nearly all respiratory infections. Also, novel only denotes we haven't seen it in humans. All viruses were novel at one point.

Eh, I don’t know much about all that, I was just trying to show that they are two different things and copied the first result. I just know it’s been said a million times that it’s not influenza, that it’s a coronavirus (yes, I was using novel to mean new as we haven’t seen it in humans before 2019), like SARS and MERS in the past. I didn’t realize I needed a full report on coronaviruses as a rebuttal to your sentence. I’m just a simple factory worker, I am definitely not educated enough for all that, so I speak in terms my simple mind can understand, I apologize. Just didn’t want anyone reading your comment to think they were the same thing because of it, there’s enough misinformation out there that we have to deal with."

Depending on how well you get along with your doctor, being honest about the weed if it shows up is your best bet. If it was a one time thing a week ago, it may not even show up, so I’d wait til they say something, but if they do, don’t try to lie your way out of it. If it’s way more than a one time thing, also don’t say it was only once, as they will most likely send it out to check the levels which will show you’re using more. 

Then it’s in their hands whether or not they want to continue prescribing, although every doctor I’ve had has given a pass at least once. It may be a good way to open up a dialog about what your doctors personal policy is with weed. Weed is usually tested in any of those drug tests, but I’ve known drs who really don’t care about it, they’re more concerned with opiates and benzos, or if you’re also using other stimulant drugs like coke or meth. And of course to check that your meds are being taken. But especially with the current laws on weed, and it’s low risk and acceptance in society, more doctors view it like they view alcohol.

https://www.hypersomniafoundation.org/education-essentials-for-students/

There’s a bunch of different links there on what you can do to help you navigate school with IH. Maybe you and your mom can sit and check it out, and see if there’s some options that could help you! It’s US based, sorry I couldn’t find if you said where you are located, and that’s what I know best, but there’s info on groups in other countries on there too if you look around. IH not only causes the sleep issues, but cognitive issues similar to ADHD, which can affect your schooling also, so it’s worth it to find out more I think.

Idk how much you know about narcolepsy, but it’s caused by a lack of the neurotransmitter (?) hypocretin/orexin (it goes by both names), which tells your brain to be awake. With IH, the theory (nothing’s been proven yet, but this is the top idea) is that we have something, a somnogen, that tells our brain to sleep all the time, it’s similar to like, having a natural supply of Xanax that you can’t control. One of the less common treatments is actually a drug, flumenazil, that is used to bring patients out of anesthesia and to reverse Xanax overdoses. So narcolepsy and IH are different in their causes, but do the same thing to you, make you sleep.  I still get grief about my IH, but I tell people who say they want to sleep all day that I don’t want to sleep, I have to sleep. It’s not something I have any control over. I’ve also fallen asleep in weird places, like standing at work in a noisy factory, while doing work, even. And things like sitting at a computer, or writing, or even reading a book are tough for me, so I purposely avoid jobs that involve those things, as I’ll be knocked out in a few minutes. I’m rambling now, sorry, I hope you can find some answers on that site. You deserve to get as much of an education as anyone else, and if your methods of getting there look different than others, so be it. If anything, we know how much harder it is when you have to climb over the IH wall each day just to get to start with everyone else."
idiopathichypersomnia,fmoygf7,t3_fwhi3n,1586270973.0,"Hey, welcome to the family! I also wasn’t told much about IH when I was diagnosed, my doctor assumed I had sleep apnea, and when I didn’t, he just told me IH and said he couldn’t treat that. So I had a couple of months lost and confused, until I found a FB group of IHers that helped me.

I usually describe IH and narcolepsy as cousins, although they aren’t caused by the same thing, they have very similar symptoms. Most people don’t know much about narcolepsy either, so comparing it doesn’t always help, but it sets the stage that I have a legitimate disorder. I’ll tell people that when I first wake up, my brain and body feel like how normal people feel after 24 hours awake, and every hour I’m awake is like another 4 hours to a normal person. Or if someone has used sleeping pills or anti anxiety meds before, I usually explain that’s how I feel all the time, that slow, groggy, just wanna lay down feeling.

A good place to look at is Hypersomnia Foundation, they’ve done a lot for research and education, and have easy to understand infographs you can show others. Unfortunately, there’s no cure for it, so most of us treat the symptoms with behavior modifications and medications. It would be good to find a sleep dr who understands IH, you can check their website or even call and ask, as not all do.  They will be able to guide you through medications and maybe recommend a therapist to help. I know I spend a lot of time in therapy working on how to navigate life and social situations with IH, and how to accept any changes I may need to make because of my IH.

As far as work and school, there are accommodations you can get to help, whether it’s a later start time, a nap during the day, or coverage for days you just can’t get out of bed. I suggest looking into that, I wish I would have right away instead of waiting. Otherwise, don’t beat yourself up, a lot of times we are our worst critics! We get down on ourselves for missing work (me today, totally slept late and couldn’t wake up), not doing as much with our kids, not getting perfect grades, or just grabbing fast food for dinner instead of cooking. It’s easy to get bogged down by the hard times, but there are also good days, and you will find a routine and meds that work for you that will make things easier.

ADHDAlien,fmff0i7,t3_fuek5v,1586025872.0,"I was diagnosed ten years ago, at 25, with ADHD. I never thought that it fit, because I’m the opposite of hyperactive, so I don’t tell many people. But I found your comics yesterday, and each one had me saying, “Hey, that’s me!” I sent them all to my mom hoping they would help her understand why i do what I do. I especially like the ones about time blindness, as I never knew what it was called or why I’m always late, and being told I have so much potential if I just applied myself all throughout school. Thanks for taking the time to make these and share them with us!"
idiopathichypersomnia,fmezz7t,t3_fuuxub,1586017150.0,"Thank you for this! I started reading the first link, but realized I have no clue what I just read, so maybe I’ll wait til I’m more awake:) I do think the premise is good, especially when it comes to coding for insurance and meds. I know I’ve been “diagnosed” ADHD for years to get my meds, but it’s hard to know whether it’s actually ADHD causing the symptoms or IH, as they both cause cognitive issues. There are definitely similarities though! I’ll try to add something more to the conversation when I’m able to process these papers better, just wanted to say thanks for sharing!"
idiopathichypersomnia,fmcmzh4,t3_fua95f,1585948798.0,"I have issues with body temp regulation too, but the opposite way, I’m almost always too hot! My face/head are constantly sweating and I’m rarely cold, even when everyone else is. I need to have a fan pointed directly on my face all night or else I wake up soaked in sweat. But when I do get cold, usually when I first wake up, I’m like shivering, painful needles and itching in my hands cold. Idk if I’m overheated due to the adderall or what it is, I just never feel normal.

My bp is usually perfect, even times when it should’ve been high it was barely above normal. Also, I’ll feel symptoms of fever but rarely read over 100F, my normal is 96-98, usually 97something. I get palpitations frequently, but again, not sure if it’s medication related or what."
GlobalTalk,fm9w3ay,t3_fts66v,1585877885.0,"Amazingly, I can still remember the alphabet song I learned 20 years ago in high school in the US. It wasn’t the same melody as the English alphabet though.

ABCDEFG
HIJKLM
NOPQ
RSTU
VWXYZ

I took 5 years on Spanish and only a year of French, but cannot for the life of me remember the Spanish song, I think it was the same melody as English though."
idiopathichypersomnia,fm7emtu,t3_fqrn15,1585824117.0,"Another thing besides finding the right meds, is to find a doctor who knows about IH or is willing to do research and learn. My first sleep doctor really just treated sleep apnea, and told me he couldn’t help. I saw psychiatrists and Gps who were willing to prescribe meds to help. After my two doctors retired, I had to find a new GP, and I saw a few before I found one who was willing to work with me instead of trying to prove me wrong. 

Also, whether you’re in school of working, check out what options you have as far as disability and reasonable accommodations. I am covered under fmla so when I’m having a bad day with my IH I can call into work without being punished. I wish I would’ve known in college that I had IH and could’ve gotten accommodations. Good luck and keep checking in!"
idiopathichypersomnia,fm4uxmq,t3_fsxeu6,1585761279.0,"I also didn’t respond well to modafinil, stimulants work best for me. I take a 20mg instant release adderall three times a day. I will skip doses whenever I can, or take half doses, to keep my tolerance down. I felt like the extended didn’t work long enough or hit me hard enough in the morning when I need the boost the most. Ritalin worked too, but just physically, mentally I was a hot mess, couldn’t remember anything. Vyvanse was eh, not much of a boost but better than nothing."
AskDocs,fm3o8cb,t1_fm3kb78,1585730732.0,"I could, but it would be unpaid. I was lucky that I had two weeks of vacation time saved up that I used to quarantine, but that’s gone now, and my bf and my sister both got let go so I cant just stay home.  I just make sure to carry my inhaler, and try not to push myself too hard."
AskDocs,fm2lwjr,t3_fsgdng,1585700190.0," Is there an urgent care available? My bf rolled his ankle a few days ago, and the urgent care clinics were pretty empty. One place had signs all over saying not to go there for Coronavirus symptoms, the other just asked him if he had any of the main Covid symptoms. I had helped him walk in but they weren’t allowing visitors so I had to wait in the car, they were being extra cautious. Just a thought if you’re worried about going to the ED, I called ahead also just to see if there was anything special we needed to do, which they seemed to appreciate."

AskDocs,fm2esd7,t1_fm1qmhi,1585696042.0,"I still have it! It’s been 14 days now, so I had to go back to work. It was rough, it seems like no matter how much air I breathe in, it’s never enough! Plus I’m getting dizzy and feeling faint whenever I exert force on anything, which is what I do all day. It was a very rough day. 

I think the fever is more common with the more severe cases, and I don’t feel bad enough to warrant a hospital visit, but it sucks not knowing why I can’t breathe right."
coolguides,fm0b0er,t1_flv7pi4,1585651679.0,"Idk, being in the southern part of the state, we really hate FIBs (Fuckin Illinois Bastard) here. They drive like idiots, go 90 mph to vacation up north in WI. Also, the Bears.

Milwaukee and Chicago have a love/hate thing going on too:)

Personally, I thought everybody hated Indiana, I know I do. I’d rather drive through Illinois than Indiana!"
