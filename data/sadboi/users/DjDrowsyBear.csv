Fallacies are often over-zealously portrayed as being inherently wrong and to be avoided at all costs. Most fallacies have their roots in legitimate arguments. 

Example: 
""Maybe we should listen to the doctor instead of the single mom when it comes to vaccinations?""

Technically, that statement would be an appeal to authority fallacy, but it is also a very valid point.

I believe that, ideally, fallacies should be understood so people can critically analyze the weight of someone's argument while also not being taken as an immediate dismissal of that persons argument and, in some cases, may actually give more validity."

Finally, I resolved to just message him. If I couldnt say it when it happened then I could still at least say something.

In so many words, I told him that him saying racial slurs was really uncomfortable for everyone. It was especially uncomfortable for me since I have so many friends of color who I felt like I was somehow betraying by just letting the slurs pass by.

By doing so, I made his use of the words very personal. If he wanted to keep saying slurs then he knew it would be making me feel awful. We talked about it a bit and he agreed to stop. In the several months since that message he hasn't said it (at least around our group) once.

Your friend sounds mostly like he is mooching off of you. If he doesnt have money for things then it shouldn't be your responsibility to support him doing them.

For your part, keeping tabs on what people owe you is just poor form and dangerous for the friendship. If you give to a friend then have it be as a gift or not at all. Otherwise you run the risk of bittering the relationship.

My advice is to cut your losses, accept that you wont be seeing any of that money and take a firm stand on not paying for anything else for him. It may also be worth it to have a serious discussion with him and tell him you feel a bit used from the whole thing. Don't be angry or petty with it. Just talk so you can tell him your feelings."

But something people also love is when someone is speaking passionately. Strong opinions and thoughts and feelings set you apart from others.

depression,ezk8v55,t3_d16wa3,1567956862.0,"Sounds like you are in a bad way.

What you need more than anything else is forward momentum.

Right now, your only way of coping (seemingly) is by drinking or sleeping. Those can potentially be helpful if done at the right times, but they are not helpful to you now.

They are not helpful to you because your depression is not temporary. You have a large set of problems (family troubles, lonliness, and high debt) which cause you to *constantly* stress. So far, your only solution has seemingly been to try and forget all of it for the moment. But all those problems still persist. And they will keep persisting.

You feel life is hopeless for you.

That you have already lost.

And the only cure for that is to start moving in a new direction.

It is not easy and doubly so since you are so depressed, but you dont have to fix everything all at once. You *never* have to fix everything at once. 

You may want to consider if certain people in your life (family included) are worth keeping around. If you feel uncomfortable cutting them out completely then you can try reducing the amount you interact with them or even just setting new boundaries where you feel less anxious when you are around them.

Consider trying to branch out and meet new people at the same time. You will almost certainly fail a lot at it, but the goal is to get you to meet enough people to find the good ones, not to find you best buds instantly.

With your debt, try setting up a budget and start wearing the debt down. It will not be fast. It will seem insurmountable, but that is going to be better than trying to always ignore it.

I hope that all is helpful"

SuicideWatch,eyr8xgg,t3_cya187,1567363021.0,"I see this sort of anger a lot. Anger at people who treat mental illness like a nice little way to make themselves feel better, and anger at those who say nice things that dont really mean anything (i.e. ""I am here for you"" or ""Things will get better"").

I understand a lot of it. Hearing the same things from people all the time who really dont understand and those who don't really care like you need them to care.

But I feel like this sort of anger is misplaced. A lot of times people say those things with good intentions. Sometimes those intentions are also mixed with selfish purposes(i.e. making themselves feel like a good little helper) but that does not (always) make their entire motive completely void.

I have thought on this a lot over the course of years, and I feel like the main message of this sort of post is ""Help people right for the right reasons or fuck you!""

I think that message promotes apathy. Good people who want to do good things end up doing even less because they have been told off by those they were trying to help when, a lot of the time, they simply do not know *how* to help or *what* to say. There is a reason people say listening is a skill.

I think this sort of post also gives an implication that good people have an obligation to help others in a way that is unhealthy for those people. It's unfortunate, but the truth of the matter is that there are very few people who can balance their own emotions along with the very intense needs of those who have depression or other mental illnesses.

Speaking frankly, I try my best to help everyone I can, especially those dealing with lonliness, anxiety, and depression. Even then though, I have a very hard time interacting with certain people with those issues. Some can just be stuck so far down that they see someone willing to talk to them and will cling *very* hard to that. I still try the best I can and I constantly try to improve, but I can only handle so much of it. If I felt a dire obligation to help every single person having a rough time mentally then I would likely just stay in bed all day getting depressed myself for how little I'm actually able to do.

Coming back to the main point, I think the better thing we can do is to point out how the actions of those pointed out in this post are unhelpful (i.e. ""This doesnt help people with my issue because..."") and then offer a better way to approach it in the future (maybe we should help this person who is upset, depressed, dealing with this mental illness by..."").

So, I suppose my suggestion would be to reestablish contact with old friends and family members. Spend more time with friends you have now and try to find more if at all possible.

niceguys,ewoe09u,t3_cp8p4w,1565615383.0,"I think most people are getting this wrong. The guy isn't hating on girls because he doesnt have a girlfriend. He is into raceplay and extreme domination/submission kinks.

He is either a tall white guy that is horny and getting turned on by... I suppose you could say pseudo-sexting that girls look at him as ""superior"" to other races or he is a short middle eastern guy pseudo-sexting that girls see him as ""inferior"" to other races.

Obviously he was disgusting either way for pushing that on a girl who was just trying to be helpful. I'm just trying to point out that the tone is much different than people are thinking."

The woman was clearly out of line to ask such a horribly insensitive request. That is just straight not normal.

That being said:

It sounds as though this isn't the first incident where something like this has happened (i.e. ""moodiness"" and your wife's fear she has anger issues). Truthfully, it seems as though you enable her behavior and make excuses for her when it does happen. You need to make sure that she doesn't accept her lashing out as normal. It's one thing to fight back and another thing to go ballistic. As her parent you need to make sure she understands the difference and why it is important to communicate and control her actions in a healthy way. 

Being in pain and mental anguish does not excuse people's behavior."
news,evzq5lj,t1_evzjj8y,1564964292.0,Agreed. There is a big difference between a game meant to entertain and relax and a platform where people go to spout off their ideas of hatred and extremeism in an echo chamber.
delusionalartists,evyffrc,t1_evxytjx,1564931246.0,"I disagree. 

I understand that the whole ""cutting the strings"" theme is very overplayed but, in this case, I got the distinct impression that the marionette cutting her own strings would cripple her.

That being said I may just be looking too much into it."
relationship_advice,evuc8rc,t1_evuai3l,1564791225.0,">Ah yes. Be perfect or divorce because hollywood told me so. Lmao.

The problem here is that no one actually knows the full story. It is one sided. There are many posts on here by many people who lack the honesty or self awareness to give damning details of themselves.

Sure, sometimes things really *are* that bad and *are* that one sided but we get easily biased into thinking the other person is the world's worst jerk while the poster is completely innocent and looking for earnest advice.

That all being said, red flag behaviors are still red flag behaviors."

TheDepthsBelow,evqnlvm,t3_ckn4q3,1564694869.0,"It just occured to me that we are a strange and foreign thing to many of these creatures. Not just in a ""huh, never saw that before"" type of way, but that we are alien creatures with even more alien equipment. Very few of these deep sea creatures even get a glimpse of one of us. Land might as well be outer space to them.

Or maybe I'm just tripping balls."
depression,evphzju,t3_ckmvf8,1564673895.0,"I have come to the realization recently that our emotions and moment to moment feelings aren't as clear cut as our language makes them out to be.

Say a friend stood you up. In the moment you may feel upset and betrayed. You start questioning why your friend wouldnt just call it off. Do they not care about you? You are confused now, because you also have known them for a long time so you want to give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe you even get mad at yourself for questioning your friend or possibly for allowing yourself to get in this position in the first place. All the while you are feeling lonely and vulnerable.

Most people in that situation would just say they feel hurt.

Emotions are more like a knotted ball of string than the clear defined lines we make them out to be. Sometimes it takes picking at different parts before we start to figure out how we feel the way we feel and why."

The 200 million just shows how good at all of that Magic's son is.

That is how I interpreted it at least."
