WatchPeopleDieInside,fpqmqgx,t1_fppqvpp,1588826502.0,The South wanted to be able to have slaves. The North wanted to rebuild the Union. It’s pretty simple. It wasn’t until Lincoln realized that the South would not rejoin the union until a finalized decision regarding slavery was made one way or the other that the Civil War become solely about Slavery. It didn’t start that way.
WatchPeopleDieInside,fpposvh,t1_fpo717m,1588806266.0,"True, but it’s not like it was out of nowhere. The war was conceptualized before battle broke out. The South’s goal was to be independent from the Union’s federal government, while the North’s goal was to absorb the South back into the Union."
WatchPeopleDieInside,fpnty3v,t1_fpnqj2m,1588772533.0,"Because they wanted to keep their “constitutional rights”, mainly slavery, I’ll give you that. However that was not why the war started. The Confederacy lived in secession for about a year before the war started. The main issue debated was slavery, yes, but the North desperately wanted to bring the South back into the Union for many reasons. That was why the war started."
WatchPeopleDieInside,fpnqa1n,t3_gee0ra,1588770190.0,"I mean more directly, the Civil War was driven around restoring the Union. The Emancipation Proclamation was purely a political symbol for the North, with no real barring on Northern Life, given that the Northerners who didn’t agree with Slavery did not have Slaves at this point.
However there came a point where the war was already so derivative on the issue of Slavery, that Lincoln and the leaders of the Union kind of shifted the focus of the war to the broader sense of bringing the Confederacy back into the Union, to making the whole battle center around Slavery. It drove the war so much, in fact, that towards the end of the war, Lincoln would allow any Confederate states that had disowned slavery back into the Union.
So while the Civil War was politically not a war that was intended to “solve” the debate of the slavery, slavery became the symbolic forefront of all issues regarding the war."

thewalkingdead,fp4o14o,t1_fp47rtr,1588303282.0,"I agree those are the better parts of the season. The Dante twist untwined with Siddiq’s arc this season was really great. But I think the episode where Carol was hallucinating (or not?) was possible the worst episode in the entire series. I can’t even put to words how ridiculous and moronic that episode is.
And I feel like Alpha and Beta’s story was shoved down our throats. I honestly think they should have put much more mystery to their characters.
Plus Rick’s absence is so noticeable. Of course we still have some amazing characters, but no one can fill Rick’s boots. And of course, that is at no fault of AMC or Kang or anybody, but that doesn’t change the fact that the series is suffering over it.
I also think the writing this season pales in comparison to any other season, besides maybe 7 and 8. Just some boring and uninspired writing. That also just seems like the theme for this season - uninspired. It’s far too predictable and feels like a zombie soap opera, more so then any other season."

TWD used to feel like a show where anybody can die at any time. Sure, that’s not the measure of a good show, but for The Walking Dead that was a big thing.
