BPD,fdjdqei,t3_elm39b,1578466575.0,"Used to be like that but not anymore. I worked  on stopping thinking that my looks define me or that I need to be attractive at all. It's not self-hate, it's rejection of capitalistic propaganda that makes you insecure in a thousand of ways and then sells you ways to ""fix"" yourself."
BPD,fd89jzt,t1_fd88cxp,1578215499.0,"I never said suppress, on the contrary I emphasized a couple of times that you have to allow them to happen just not act on them. But overall agree"
BPD,fd6qnrg,t1_fd6pxpb,1578194537.0,Yeah. Feeling in control and responsible is essential for us
BPD,fd69boi,t1_fd6976j,1578187504.0,Glad to help
BPD,fczde7f,t3_e7zw34,1578098694.0,"That's very powerful. I felt better just reading it. I don't even want to create the whiny post I made this account for anymore. OP, you're the best."
