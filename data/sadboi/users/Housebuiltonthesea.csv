It really did just click. Then I have felt like that most days since that day. Best decision I ever made.

I'm still very depressed. All it did was take away the ups, not the downs. But, there are no dramatic changes between ups and downs, which can be very stressful, so I guess it did something. I'd rather always be down than be up and down all the time. I have become very quiet and very antisocial. I just stay in my room, go to work, stay in my room, then sleep. Everywhere I go, I wear a hat and hood with my head down and try to be avoided and avoid others. I have basically no sex drive anymore. I just feel either nothing, or depressed. I was diagnosed with OCD and depression, and I guess it has eased the symptoms of OCD because I simply just don't care about anything. It sucks, it really does. But it's a little better than constant ups and downs."
