BPD,f31809u,t3_df3ow8,1570569768.0,FPs are basically an emotional crutch we use. It’s ok as long as both people are aware of the dangers of BPD relationships and especially Codependent relationships.

BPD,ezqetj4,t3_d1vinp,1568058311.0,"Dissociation varies a lot person to person and encompasses a lot of different things depending on the persons subjective experience. It’s really hard to describe and harder to understand if you’ve never experienced it. 

For me i experience two kinds of dissociation. The first kind is pretty common, i call them “benign” episodes but that’s just my term. Basically it’s involuntary daydreaming; like I’ll lose my train of thought and start thinking about something random. Sometimes it’s nonsense shower thoughts, sometimes i overthink a situation, sometimes they’re violent intrusive thoughts. It’s mostly annoying and i get around by practicing “grounding” techniques. 

The second kind of dissociation i experience is really dangerous. These episodes are essentially PTSD attacks, brought on by specific triggers, which vary in strength/duration depending on how “triggered” i get. I experience amnesia during these episodes i.e. no memory of the event forms in my mind as if i were blackout drunk. I’m incapable of rational thoughts during the episode and am liable to hurt myself or others. These are rare and brought on by a significant event and pulling me out and grounding me back in reality mostly involves physically removing me from the stress and helping me relax. They can last minutes or hours. 

Dissociation is different for everyone, it’s a subjective experience that revolves around your perception of self and reality being distorted. It’s a defense mechanism linked to trauma and is triggered in high stress situations. In BPD they’re usually brought on by intense emotions, and end via emotional validation. But like i said it varies"
BPD,ezqbh2f,t3_d1sghb,1568057129.0,"What you’re describing sounds a lot like symptoms of complex PTSD. I will say i definitely feel like this a lot, a good way around it is to allow myself to feel something different through another medium, like watching an uplifting movie, listening to happy music etc. i suggest you go to r/cPTSD, there you’ll find people that experience this specifically hat can offer better aimed advice. Most of us on here are good at offering advice for emotional regulation and DBT practices, these help with processing trauma/intense experience but that’s not the primary goal."
BPD,eyzve95,t1_eyzqv3e,1567625464.0,"You don’t need to worry about “needing” medication. Practicing DBT skills consistently over years forces your brain to develop the pathways necessary for processing emotions in a healthy way. Those are the “skills” we’re referring to. Most people with bpd have mixed experiences with medications, mainly because we expect them to do more than they do; they don’t make us better, they put us in a position to make ourselves better. 

Obviously meds directly treat comorbid conditions, for me adderall treats my adhd really well, it helps a lot with energy too, but i don’t need it to be awake, just to focus on things like my engineering work. I don’t even need caffeine except for maintaining work schedules early in the morning (i have trouble falling and staying asleep and meds for that make me wanna sleep 12 hours)"
BPD,eyzl6n2,t1_eyzklgs,1567620197.0,"It’s definitely psychological, like i know my body won’t feel the caffeine in a cup of decaf but drinking it wakes me up still.

BPD,eyzhlft,t3_czneem,1567617903.0,"100% bpd is the result of structural brain issues, the way to “cure” it is to force yourself to think and act correctly over a long period of time, usually 1-2 years for DBT. That’s because the brain is a living organ and the pathways aren’t set in stone, it will change and build new pathways. That’s why practice makes perfect; the brain slowly improves the pathways you use over time. It’s almost impossible to notice in the moment because it’s so subtle. Just keep thinking positive/healthy and you’ll  be fine. Congratulations btw"
BPD,eyzgzt8,t3_cznem0,1567617522.0,"First i wanna say that you’re absolutely right about medication and that’s the thing most people don’t understand about this disorder. You worded it really well so excellent post.

About coffee, i had a serious problem with just caffeine. It got to the point where one day i started getting onset symptoms of caffeine poisoning. To get around this i use a combination of things for energy and alertness. Energy drinks/foods and multivitamins are better in this regard because it’s not putting all your eggs in one basket. 

The thing about addiction is that for something o be classified as a psychological addiction rather than a physical one is that it needs to be at a point where it’s unhealthy/bad for you. Coffee isn’t bad for you unless your consuming grams of caffeine. It’s about moderation and pacing. Your body is physically addicted to caffeine, but that’s not really a problem because it’s readily available, it’s only a problem if you feed it into a bigger dependency by increasing the amount of caffeine regularly. 

Pace yourself and limit your intake, like say 16oz in the morning and 8oz at lunch. If that’s hard drink decaf later in the day, it still has a little caffeine but only 5-10% of regular coffee. Do your best to track consumption in mg of caffeine rather than cups.

Personally i take adderall, a multivitamin and drink a low carb monster in the morning. It’s a lot but it’s what gets me through any amount of work and keeps me focused. On off days i don’t need either, i try to not consume stimulants one day a week to check but natural tolerance."

Similarly in right wing politics any thing less than total responsibility for everything in your life, even things outside your control, is seen as weakness and also invalidates the person’s struggles.

You really need to speak to a therapist in order to figure out exactly what you’re problems are. It’s good that you came here out of curiosity but we’re just people with this condition, not psychiatrists. If you’re curious i suggest you go online and read more about bpd, if a lot of what you see is relatable then you could have it. For most people with bpd something has always been wrong, and we’ve always struggled with every aspect of life, even when we appeared healthy or thriving, we’re in constant inner turmoil. One bad trip and a repressed fear of abandonment isn’t at all enough to say whether or not have bpd. It took me over four months of therapy to receive my diagnosis. In any case you won’t know more until you see a professional and are honest and open with them, because it sounds like something isn’t right and only medical professionals will be able to provide you the right answer.

You should post this in the cPTSD sub reddit. The community there is very supportive in the same way this one is, but most of the members will have more concrete advice about how to deal with an abusive ex. For most bpd people, the initial abusers are parents, family, school bullies and the like, so a lot of us learned to deal with abusers from a different angle.

We’ll feel overwhelmed during an episode and sometimes we don’t see a way out and just make an attempt on our lives in the moment. That’s why 90% of pwBPD attempt suicide but only 10% succeed.

BPD,evssowh,t3_ckuhvt,1564755308.0,"You’re absolutely right. The best way to figure out if you’re reaction is justified or if it’s actual splitting is to write what you KNOW happened and run it by someone who’s neurotypical to see what they think. I’m honestly like 80/20 on bpd paranoia vs something actually going on. Like friends go out to do something or make plans i immediately think they’re excluding me intentionally, when really it was an in the moment decision to go out or see a movie or something"
relationships,evss477,t1_evrwvw9,1564754934.0,"That’s not entirely true for bpd. It’s mostly that we’re hyper aware of social cues as it relates to us. We pick up on every little thing in all our interactions and know when something is off. What we do about it, and how we process it is where the bpd comes in. Posting here and asking for advice from regular people is honestly a great way to get some perspective on these issues when we’re not sure if it’s us over reacting or there’s a good way to fix a problem we see"

There’s a bunch on amazon for under $20 please get one of those if you really need help. A supportive friend with one of those books can quickly get you to being a functional person that isn’t hurting themselves or others. Self help books can give you coping mechanisms and tools to get through life, until you can afford proper treatment to get at the deep down issues like repressed memories and dissociation. I still experience inner turmoil, but i now can handle it and still fiction without hurting myself or damaging my relationships"
BPD,euwa5ks,t3_chpjpf,1564072823.0,"Quiet BPD exhibits very differently than the common bpd, especially in men. Common bpd in men tends towards those more overt abusive behaviors, whereas quiet we do lash inwards not out. As someone who fits more with quiet, I’d say this guy is genuinely not manipulating you or pretending, his anxieties about fear of rejection just override his desperate need for validation. This happened to me for most of my life where i kept every problem to myself thinking that men don’t feel kinda way. I pushed myself beyond the breaking point in contact sports, i binge ate, starved myself, and took my anger out in socially acceptable ways. When i was injured and couldn’t play contacts or engage in intense exercise anymore i turned to substances. All of those behaviors/coping primarily hurt me, not others. Your friend is probably similar in that regard. He could also not be acting out and just experiencing inner turmoil, something i struggle with still. 

If you want to help him, validate his emotions, and show him yours to build trust. Make sure you establish functional boundaries too. The biggest risk is that he’ll form a codependent bond with you and enjoying your company will become needing your company. Those situations basically put his stress on you which can be toxic, i know from forming those by accident in the past. Just be open and have a conversation about it with him. If you’re both aware of each others problems and open with communication/expectations then you’ll set yourself up for success.

Edit: That infatuation that ended his last relationship is super easy for us to fall into. We don’t like, we love and it can consume our lives because we don’t value our life, only yours if that makes sense. That kind of love can be very suffocating the way around is for both of you to recognize that you NEED lives outside of each other and to be open about those lives and when you need space."

The only thing that comes to mind me is the Minecraft sub, where people post screenshots of what they built and the feedback is pretty positive on there and the criticism is very constructive. I think validating environments can be healthier, because some criticism is just toxic.

BPD4BPD,eurpb8y,t3_ch7lja,1563997130.0,"I wrote a post explaining this, basically people with BPD need to be all in for their treatment and actively being mindful, but sometimes they just go through the motions and aren’t actively trying to improve. That’s why it’s stigmatized in the medical community. 
People with BPD who are unaware/in denial of their condition and not seeking treatment or trying to get better are genuinely horrible people who are very abusive. Those are most of the stories people post about on raisedbyborderlines and BPDlovedones"

BPD,euqwth6,t3_ch9683,1563986425.0,"The key difference between BPD and bipolar is what triggers the mood swings. BPD is really dependent on external factors, like what people say to and about you and how you process regular life stress. Bipolar is a chemical imbalance in the brain where it shifts between produce too many neurotransmitters and not enough. 
If you experience a combination of both then you could have a cooccurring disorder like major depression which has long lows that aren’t consistent with the mood swings of BPD. That’s what i have, and learning that makes a big difference. I highly suggest you read up on BPD and DBT because if you’re functioning and experiencing severe inner turmoil like me then being self aware is half the battle. Check my prior posts about this and feel free to PM me any personal questions because i was in a similar position last September of getting treated for depression but still feeling BPD symptoms"
BPD,euqvs7w,t3_ch97qs,1563986001.0,"The hardest part is changing routines and picking up the skills they teach you. I struggled a lot but always maintained the appearance of functionality even when contemplating or carrying out suicide attempts. Look at some of my other posts for advice.
The key thing are sobriety, awareness and healthy coping mechanisms. When i say “healthy” i mean non destructive or hurtful to you or others. I also highly recommend that you and your mom read “Loving someone with Borderline Personality Disorder” lots of useful information for both of you. If you both understand how you think, then managing symptoms becomes easier.

BPD,eu92oig,t3_cfbp9i,1563570283.0,"I felt this in my soul reading your post. The important thing is coping in ways that don’t hurt you or others. I don’t know how to make the pain go away, but i do know how to handle it without hurting anyone. Friends, pets and other distractions are really good. Avoid substances and self harm.
If you feel the need to reach out to this guy or someone else in a desperate way write it out in notes or on paper and let it sit a while. Venting things onto paper works for me when I’m in crisis, it lets me feel enough relief to distract myself and revisit the message/thoughts with my rational mind.

BPD,eu1v87u,t3_ce9lse,1563376230.0,"I feel this 24/7, for me i just remind myself that i care way more than anyone else can/will and start from.

Like if i show my friends something i love i don’t expect them to feel the same way about it to the same degree i do, but if they feel the same way to a lesser extent that’s what i look for. 
No one with a healthy brain will ever feel as much as we do, but they certainly feel the same emotions but not as overwhelmingly. Try to separate out when you’re being triggered by someone not validating your feelings vs when you’re triggered by someone failing to live up to your emotional expectations. You should be triggered by invalidation, you shouldn’t be triggered by people being apathetic relative to your intense emotions"
