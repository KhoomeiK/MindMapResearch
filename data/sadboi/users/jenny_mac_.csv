EatingDisorders,fqmjgad,t3_gjgzgc,1589478445.0,Definitely takes time and practice so be patient and forgiving with yourself üíñ I find that using a mental reminder like ‚Äúmy body does not define me‚Äù or ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt matter what my body looks like‚Äù when I notice the urge to check helps. You‚Äôre creating new neural pathways so that eventually you‚Äôll automatically think those reassuring thoughts instead and won‚Äôt feel the urge!
EatingDisorders,fqf7194,t3_gi8hf1,1589319784.0,"I‚Äôm so sorry this has happened, and that you‚Äôre being challenged in your recovery. I know there are a lot of comments about how wrong your mother was and know it probably brings up a lot of anger. Try to remember that she is literally brainwashed by diet culture and her upbringing within a fat-phobic society. Her comment is actually coming from a place of wanting what she thinks is best for you/protecting you OR she hates herself so much she is taking it out on you... So try to have some compassion/forgiveness, as hard as that must be. That said, it is NOT acceptable for her to comment about your weight and eating EVER. You should try to establish boundaries with her so she knows that those topics are completely off limits. You could also try to explain how the comment was really hurtful/how it made you feel and see if she realizes how insensitive it is. If you have a therapist or other friends in recovery, reach out for support! 
Listen to the Food Psych and Love Food Podcasts for help with the binging. Practicing Intuitive eating is the only tried and true method to battling ED in my experience. Do you have the Intuitive Eating book by Evelyn Tribole and Rush? Remember that you are loved and worthy no matter what your size/shape and that your body does NOT define you.

Ayahuasca,fgpq94z,t1_fgoglcp,1581009899.0,"Totally understand that. I think the experience of preparation with cleaning up diet, slowing down, taking good care of yourself, journaling, setting intention, and going inward in the weeks beforehand can make the weekend experience feel like a longer process.

I definitely agree with finding what your core values are and living in accordance with them while practicing forgiveness. 
Start a journaling or self reflection practice to identify why you don‚Äôt love yourself and what your limiting beliefs are. Try to identify where they came from (parents, siblings, friends, media, society). Work your hardest at questioning and unpacking these limiting beliefs and keep acting in alignment with your values. 

I can‚Äôt imagine these wouldn‚Äôt help! 

Best of luck and sending lots of virtual support!"

You can get creative with ways to reuse things like jars, bags, or newspapers. 

Creatively, the opportunities are endless! Was there a type of art/creativity you enjoyed as a kid?

selfimprovement,ff9svxf,t3_es9623,1579720529.0,"Hey man, I commend you for your motivation to change! I agree with the others about recognizing that change will be incremental and to not beat yourself up if you fail. As someone who has recovered from disordered eating, exercise and diet addiction, it is 100% possible to rewire your brain and relationship to your body. But it will be a journey! 

-I‚Äôd recommend starting to journal your thoughts and feelings. Totally free form, expectations brain dump. And only when you feel like it. 

-Start shifting to try to be in bed my 10PM to read, and to avoid sugar or stimulants in the evening and screen time past 8 PM. This will really help you sleep earlier. 

-Try to replace your previous hobbies with healthier ones. What are you interested in? Can you join a club or take classes? Maybe there‚Äôs a new type of movement you don‚Äôt know you like like rock climbing or dance. Definitely be experimental in getting to know your true self. Because it is not the person engaging in these unfulfilling behaviors. What did you like to do as a kid pre-porn addiction?

-try to look inward and see why you are motivated to engage in these numbing behaviors originally. Do you have un-dealt with trauma or pain from childhood? Do you have deep sorrow that is buried? Use journaling and movement and other techniques that work for you (therapy, acupuncture, movement, breath, etc) to move this energetic baggage out. 

Best of luck my man! You can do it!"

EnvironmentalScience,esbf04u,t3_c6nejy,1561789008.0,"Also look up the regional supplement to the USACE manual for your area. You‚Äôll need wetland delineation data sheets for each soil pit (attached as appendix to USACE manual/supplement). I‚Äôd recommend looking up a local wetland plant field guide or a flora if you‚Äôre experienced with plant ID. A guide particularly for sedges and rushes may be worthwhile. A hand lens, for plant ID is nice too. Soil augers can be less useful than just digging a 16+inch pit with a sharp shooter shovel. You‚Äôll want a measuring tape to measure your soil profile (to key soils) and the wetland training institute‚Äôs (WTI) pocket guide to hydric soils. Taking a week long wetland delineation training from WTI is definitely recommended if you‚Äôre going to pursue a career in delineations. Have fun!
