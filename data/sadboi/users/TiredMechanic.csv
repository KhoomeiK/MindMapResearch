Imagine if they held back a promotion from an elderly person because their vision was starting to fail.. save any emails that you have regarding the examination and promotions being related, or any written documents, and if you don't have one, ask them to furnish them. Then, even though I'm broke and it would be tough, I'd try and find a lawyer, and bring them that evidence. But you will also possibly need to be able to show evidence that other people that 'passed' the exam got their raises, and prove that your lack of earning on was solely based on the tests.  It will take a long time to sort out, and that's what they want, but also it's completely not fair."
