I've been doing this for months, I find escapes just so I don't have to think about life or school, then when midnight hits I'm like ""well, guess it's bedtime, tomorrow is another day"", then the same thing happens the next day. I feel like at some point it's gonna come back to bite me and I'm just waiting.

depression,f9dxu7l,t3_e466xi,1575237803.0,"I remember being very depressed, I was sure of it, crying a lot, worrying a lot, allowing the smallest of troubles to destroy my mental state, but at a certain point it was like I would forget all about my feelings and pretend to be happy, like everything was OK, then when it was time for bed all my feelings would come back, it was like my mind was suppressing them so I could feel better and go throughout the day and then pushing them back up when it felt like it was safe, when I was alone. 

At one point I thought I was bipolar. I would feel a certain way, then when I spoke about it to my friends I would be like wait what I don't feel that way. It's weird, I started to think that maybe I was making things up in my head to make me feel more depressed, so that I could have an excuse for my problems. I started to not trust myself or my thoughts, so I wouldn't speak much, because most of the time when I spoke about my feelings or about myself in general it never felt like it was really me saying it, like I never had those feelings, when I really did.

I don't really know how, but I'm not depressed anymore, things haven't really gotten better, but I'm not feeling depressed like I was before. I'm starting to think that maybe my mind just got better at suppressing my feelings with some help from escapism, but what do I know, like I said, I don't trust myself, this could all be a figment of my imagination and I wouldn't know."
depression,f8rp0od,t3_e1sujg,1574747262.0,"About two years ago my parents made the decision to migrate. When they first started making plans, about 5 years ago, it sounded like a great idea. My life was going to drastically change, for the better, I could have all the things I wanted. Soon after, high school came around and I started making friends, coming out of my shell and somewhat enjoying life. At this point migrating never really crossed my mind and when it did, I dismissed it, having put more thought into it and how it wouldn't be all sunshine and rainbows. The year before I left I had a falling out with my friends, everyone knew, at the time I thought it was the loneliest, most depressing and vulnerable period of my life. 

My parents were still planning on migrating, but it was mostly small talk and I never got details so I assumed it wasn't happening. Then I got the news and at first I didn't say or think anything. Then I started thinking that maybe this was a good thing, I hated my life anyways, my friends weren't really my friends anymore, my grades weren't the best and my life just felt dull and routined, maybe this could be the fresh start that I need. Then I realized how much I'd have to suffer just to get a fresh start and it terrified me. I didn't want to go anymore, told my parents I'd live with my relatives, but they refused. 

A few months after the move and I realized I was right. My life sucked. I was lonely and anxious, being introverted never helped. The only people I had in my life were my parents and sister, who I didn't have a good relationship with anyways. School felt like a chore, I genuinely hated it, every time I was there it felt like the walls were closing in on me. For a long while I was very depressed, more than I had ever been in my life. Every time I suffered I said it'd be better next time around and I was wrong every time. Eventually I gave up on trying to find genuine happiness, locked myself up, prevented myself from speaking, even when I felt the need to, convinced myself I didn't need anyone in my life,  that life was meaningless. Even though I couldn't fully convince myself, I started using methods of escapism to fill the gaps. 

I daydreamed a lot more, watched increasingly more movies and tv shows, played more games, joined more social media platforms, even if it wasn't something I enjoyed doing, I did it just so that I could stop thinking about my life. Honestly, it all worked out pretty well, because now I can live with myself and my life no matter how bad it gets, just find an escape and I can forget all about it. Normally I would overthink every situation, get stressed and depressed over the smallest of things, cry most nights, contemplate suicide and live in existential dread. Nowadays, almost nothing phases me (except maybe embarrassment and existential dread, just a little), it's not the right way to live, I'm sure, but it feels so much better than to live like I did previously. I can't live like this forever, there's going to come a point that I break and I've kinda made up my mind that when that point comes, I can hopefully end it.

Now I'm not saying you should try what I did, as there a definitely consequences, I'm just trying to relate. I hope your life gets better OP, if you're like me and you're introverted and anxious most of the time, but also want to make meaningful relationships and talk to people, I'd suggest getting outside your comfort zone, try looking for people with similar interests or people who are in a similar situation, as I've found that with those people, you can develop a genuine relationship and it'll feel like you fit right in."
SuicideWatch,f8386ku,t3_dyksb2,1574206467.0,"This is kinda working against me, because every time I get stressed or have something negative occur in my life I tell myself it's fine because I'm gonna kill myself anyway so it doesn't matter, which ends up making me never resolve those issues, leading to more stress and the cycle continues. To make it all worse, as much as I do think of suicide, I don't think I'll ever do it and if I were to, something very significant would have to occur. The things that stress me out from day to day are enough to make me think of suicide but never enough to make me actually do it."

lonely,f6r74kb,t3_dsovyn,1573095407.0,">But slowly, everyone started breaking into groups. I used to be part of one, but they made me feel unwelcome.

I felt the exact same way about two years ago when I moved to a new school. I moved there in mid Grade 10, meaning everyone already had a year and a half to make friends and I was just the new guy, all alone. I was very depressed, more than I've ever been. Last year around this time I started making friends and joined a group but soon after I left, because I felt unwanted, like a liability. I knew I would go back to being depressed, but I felt it was better than feeling unwanted.

I have a very hard time meeting new people and making friends and since I eventually decided to isolate myself after not being able to find friends, I now have a hard time talking to people in general. 

>I have been cutting myself to feel better which helps sometimes. I do not know what else to do at this point.

I've never done self-harm before, but I've had a lot of suicidal thoughts, the only things that kept me from committing to it was the hope that things would get better, a ton of daydreaming and being too afraid. 

Things have kinda gotten better. The most I really did was suppress my emotions, try to find every escape possible and convince myself I don't care about things as much as I did, like friends. Now I wouldn't say to do what I did, because there definitely are negatives, but the best advice I can give is not to make lacking friends ruin the rest of your life, because things can get worse. 

Don't let loneliness or depression make you feel hopeless, try your best to fight it, try to look for other areas in your life that you could work on that could improve your mental state and self-esteem. I'm currently fighting as hard as I can, but I'll say that it's not easy, it takes time. There'll be times when even the slightest inconvenience or problem hits much harder than you expected, but still keep fighting, train yourself to take those punches and stay standing. 

That's all the advice I can give right now, hope it helps, goodnight."

SuicideWatch,f6kpnpw,t3_drqquo,1572917635.0,"I had the same problem, I would constantly think about suicide, was depressed most of the time, but used day dreaming, video games, movies and TV shows as my coping mechanisms. They worked, but a little bit too well Tbh. My life still sucks, probably getting worse, but I don't feel anything, I'm not sad, depressed, anxious, I don't cry or think about life that much, it just doesn't happen anymore.

 When I was depressed I had a drive to kill myself, I was most willing during that time, but it also gave me the drive to live, in hopes that things would be better. Now, since I don't actually feel depressed, even though I should, I don't have the drive to kill myself anymore. I don't want to be alive, I would gladly accept my death if it  was just random, like getting hit by a car, robbed and killed, or something else, but I just can't bring myself to try to kill myself anymore.

I can't talk to anyone about it. I told a few friends but they live in another country, so they can't do anything about it, they eventually got annoyed and started ignoring anything I said. I can't tell my parents, for more personal reasons, I can't seek therapy, because my parents would find out, so I just end up finding as much of an escape that I can, which are Video games, YouTube, any form of social media, movies, TV shows, daydreaming, anything.

 Life sucks, it definitely isn't fair and I don't think it was ever meant to be. People always say things will be fine, but they just say that in hopes that you don't do it. ""go to therapy"" ""have you tried meds"" ""talk to someone"", die they help, but only temporarily, they're no different from my other coping mechanism, other than that they last slightly longer, they don't solve my issues, they never will."

lonely,f6isene,t3_drefra,1572883627.0,"I've recently been feeling very weird when it comes to my depression, anxiety, sadness and loneliness. Last year I was very depressed, mostly because I could never make friends, felt lonely, like I had no purpose, like I never mattered. I would cry a lot and daydream a lot (still do), my life was just terrible.

Eventually I started watching a lot more shows, movies, playing a lot more games, listening to a lot more music and daydreaming a lot more as coping mechanisns for my depression. Recently, about 2 months ago I started to feel nothing, I wasn't depressed or sad anymore, I was just there, it was like my coping mechanisms had done there job, but permanently. My life never got any better, I just stopped feeling things, stopped caring. The only thing that makes me feel something is embarrassment.

Now I'm kind of confused, because my life isn't getting better, maybe worse, I'm not sad or depressed, but even though I hated those feelings, they kinda drove me to do things and seek a better life. But now, since I'm not feeling that way, I'm not motivated to do anything, I can't get any school work done, when I procrastinate I don't start worrying, even on the last day. Bad things happen and I just let them, because I can just live with them nowadays, telling myself that if they get too bad I'll just kill myself.

In that case, then go for it, if he still has feelings, then it's a win, if he doesn't the you're both even. You both confessed so you have nothing to be ashamed of.

On the other hand, he might feel upset that you're either just confessing your feelings, which you may have had for a while or that you only now developed feelings for him, but that depends on when he told you.

Also, your boyfriend's issue with not keeping people go, even though it could justify his actions is kind of hard to understand. If he hated his relationship so much, if it was so toxic that he decided to leave, why still hang out with her? I could maybe understand him trying to retain a relationship with her uncle, so he checks up on her and gives her attention, if that were the case, he would need to speak with her uncle and explain why he broke up with her and doesn't really want to have any sort of relationship with her.

As for your anxiety, I suffer from anxiety as well, always overthinking, thinking the worst will happen or thinking people around me hate me or are secretly plotting against me. I could just go ask and confirm whether or not this is true, but I don't have the will or confidence. In your case, however, you're in a relationship, one that sounds pretty serious, so you both should be honest and shouldn't have problems communicating or expressing feelings, views, etc. 

So you probably need to confront him, ask him more about why he's texting her, ask him to see texts, make sure he doesn't stall, cause he may try to hide evidence. Tell him that if you both are committed then you both should be able to be truthful. Anyways, that's all I got, hope it helps."

I try as hard as possible to not talk about my depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts, because I almost always regret it.

My life nowadays is just dull and meaningless. I can't relate to anyone, even though I migrated here almost 2 years ago, it's still hard, I'm also not very socially active and find it hard to make friends, so I try my best to keep friends that I have, but to do that I have to pretend like everything is OK, like I'm interested in things they are, when all I'm thinking about is how much I hate my life and convenient dates I could kms.
