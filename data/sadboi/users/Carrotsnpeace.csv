Nigeria,fn2x9xh,t1_fn2lsic,1586606654.0,"That’s cute! I’m sure he likes that you care to ask questions!

We met at work close to four years ago. There have been quite a few cultural differences. It has not been easy at times, but love will find a way.

The biggest difference is how we communicate, and we are FINALLY getting to a point where we are ok, but not perfect. 

For example, while you are conversing with someone it is natural to agree with someone and maybe add to the conversation while the other person is speaking. My husband told me Nigerians do not like that, including himself, as that is a form of disrespect. They like to be fully heard with their thought before you respond. On the other hand, my husband likes to keep quiet while I speak so I can get my thought out too. It was an interesting adjustment in the beginning. 

Another point is just talking in general. They talk loud and you may think that they are yelling, but that is just how they talk. You mentioned he is an introvert so I don’t know if that translates over to how loud is voice is, but it’s good to know. My husband is a loud talker and there have been multiple times where I think he is mad over something, so it escalates, but really he is just talking.

Cleanliness is something else. The house always has to look spotless. I have never really been a super clean person, so that was (and still is a little bit, but much better) a bone of contention. No dishes in the sink overnight, laundry folded, just overall clean. 

People will just come over without calling. He says that people are always welcome in an African home, and there will always be drinks/food for your guests. That was definitely some adjusting. Even last Thanksgiving, I had a one day notice for his friend, three kids and wife to come over. That is still a work in progress! I like having people over with warning. 

Religion is huge. I am an anxious person by nature and there have been many times where I feel like he should be more concerned about something than he actually is. He always tells me by Gods Grace it will be ok. I am not used to that, I was raised Catholic but my family just went to church every Sunday, that was it. Everything translates back to God and it was something that I really had to get used to. 

As kind of an aside, food is a big part of their culture. Food and music. You will always see rice and meat at a Nigerians house, and they will eat that at least once a day. My husband told me once that if he doesn’t eat rice or meat in a day then he doesn’t feel like he’s ate lol. If you get to the point where you all start dating and you visit someone’s house, eat their food when offered, and finish it. It is disrespectful to not eat what someone has cooked."
Nigeria,fn1xl2n,t1_fn1rtrw,1586572558.0,"Do you have Netflix? If you search ‘Nigeria’ or ‘Nollywood’ you will find some. ‘The Wedding Party’, ‘The Wedding Party 2’, ‘Chief Daddy’ are three that I enjoy. They have movies on YouTube too, however I personally don’t care for them much.

You can start a conversation saying that you stumbled upon ‘xx’ on Netflix!

I hope that helps! Keep us updated. 😀 If you have any other questions please ask! Just for some context, I am a white girl born and living in the U.S."
Nigeria,fn1ma0v,t3_fypw2s,1586565052.0,"My husband is Yoruba- he said the best way to ask is to point blank just tell him you want to learn about his culture, starting with language, food, customs, etc. He said that will open up the conversation about what he knows best, then the deeper you get then you can ask about his family, etc. 

My husband likes when you go straight to the point about something. I’m sure he would appreciate you wanting to learn more about him. Nigerians I found take a lot of pride in their culture and love talking about it, which is lovely.

If you have any questions feel free to message me."

sleep,flexdco,t3_focpo6,1585093452.0,"1. I would recommend putting down the screen. I don’t know the research exactly but it has something to do with messing with our brain signals, which keeps us awake.

2. Have you tried magnesium? I take it every night (Natural Vitality Calm) and I fall asleep within 20 minutes.

3. Try reading a book or drawing, maybe that sounds silly but I think that can relax your (general your) brain.

4. Yoga is super helpful. There are a bunch of bedtime yoga videos that help. Yoga with Adriene is a lovely human and her practices are beautiful.

5. Deep breathing- it can really help to activate your parasympathetic nervous system."
