depression,fajkvhk,t3_e9iko7,1576142984.0,"I work full time weekdays. At work, I‚Äôve been told  I‚Äôm responsible, reliable, fast, smart, active; a model employee.

I get home I‚Äôm a beating heart away from literal corpse. Well, I take care of hygiene, I work out, do laundry, but I do that with minimum efforts and only do that to maintain a ‚Äúprofessional facade‚Äù. Most of my weekends consist of ten 2-hours nap a day and crying.

Then on Monday I go to work and function well like no other. When I‚Äôm gonna be eventually end myself and not show up at work, it‚Äôll be quite of a surprise."

It‚Äôs not the first time I‚Äôve heard of the gratitude journaling. Many therapists and self help books are recommending it. The concept is simple enough; thinking about the things that I am thankful for and making notes of them daily. Of course I never did it. What is there for me to be grateful for, when I‚Äôm so miserable every passing moment? It almost sounded condescending.

But now I‚Äôm thinking, maybe I could start with tiny things like ‚Äútoday I had lunch and didn‚Äôt see it in reverse‚Äù. Absence of bad things could be something positive and something to be grateful for, right? I mean why tf not. Maybe a long streak of okay-days and the record of it could trick myself into feeling okay about this life for once.

Nothing to lose. I‚Äôm gonna try gratitude journaling. I‚Äôm gonna have to force myself to do so, but gonna try at least for a month."
depression,fa9ob1p,t3_e83byl,1575883067.0,"Think about it like this: you can kill yourself anytime. It‚Äôs entirely in your power and totally dependent on your decision. Whenever you feel defeated, know that you can always kill yourself. That is the power you have over your own life even in your most vulnerable state.

And on the flip side, you can let you live. You can let you live your life in any way you please. That is the power you have. Yeah maybe there are too much shit lying around and you feel like chocking. Throw that shit out then. Snap break the hands that are chocking you.

In fact I feel the same as you. I know by now that I will kill myself. I know the method and have several attempts under my belt. But I am giving myself a chance. I‚Äôm letting myself live for now, because I can kill myself anytime I please. I still hate myself but I hate a lot of people more than I hate myself, but I don‚Äôt go out killing them do I? I‚Äôm just giving myself the same chance as I do for others. Because I deserve that much. You deserve that much if nothing else. A chance. And several chances more.

You deserve to live because you are alive now. Usefulness doesn‚Äôt dictate your worth, unlike this society keeps telling you. Give yourself chances. Cut some slacks for yourself. See how you like it and then decide, because you‚Äôre never too late to kill yourself."
depression,fa9krfs,t3_e81ps7,1575877938.0,"No one cares about anyone else. Period. That‚Äôs it. You know who is the only person who should and could care about you? Only yourself.

Many would tell you to stay alive for your parents or your so, but some of us don‚Äôt have them and even if you do, those people could be callous as any strangers. Ngl people will forget any suicide in the long run because that person would be gone and no care can bring them back.

Live out of spite. Live for yourself not for anybody else. Live in spite of those selfish assholes because you know what? You are important to YOU. You are the only YOU there is. Quit giving fuck about people‚Äôs opinion on your depression, they cannot help you. No one can help you unless you start to value yourself more than you value other people‚Äôs ‚Äúcare‚Äù.

I hope I don‚Äôt sound like an asshole. I am in the same boat and I‚Äôve given up on people in general. Post several attempts, I became a nuisance and people around me are almost expecting me to go through it. But I am still here because now I know that nobody actually can help me. Only I can save me from myself. I am alive because I care about me. I hope this could somehow helpful to you. I hope you will see next year and years after that. You‚Äôre important to you."

Everything women clothing represents is that women‚Äôs clothing is for the spectators and bodytype police who love to shape women‚Äôs body against their will and needs to be comfortable and distort body image and confidence.

Nobody made any effort to contact me since. My phone number never changed. I live in the same place and work the same job. It‚Äôs not hard to track me down, and absolutely no one reached out first.
I have given up. It still hurts though. I hope you could find someone who value you enough to make efforts. Sorry for ranting. I‚Äôm just sad and angry that it‚Äôs never gonna happen for me."

AskReddit,f0a2s1f,t3_d46gn5,1568509963.0,"A lot of rant YouTubers. I like to watch insightful ranting that puts my thoughts into words. They‚Äôre cathartic.

Some of them moved on from making witty rants to reproducing mainstream memes. It felt like they‚Äôve gotten too rich and that having money removed all of their opinions on anything. Like they‚Äôre too happy to develop any negative but productive commentaries, so instead they‚Äôve dove into brainless vlog channel featuring their dogs and them baby talking to their dogs 99% of the time.

They even made a video about their contents changing and not ranting anymore. They even explained it as something close to ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too happy to rant anymore‚Äù. I unsubscribed soon after that."
