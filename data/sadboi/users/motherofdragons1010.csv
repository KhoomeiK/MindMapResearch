adhd_anxiety,flk2uai,t3_foxzra,1585232747.0,I'm helping my ADHD son with his 6th grade stuff and it takes us ALL day! I'm ADHD but when I need to do an assignment once I start I can finish fast but I have to drag him through each problem and it's driving me nuts. Not as bad as others situations I'm sure but that on top of working full time is too much for me right now
AskReddit,f4v49gy,t3_dlrz06,1571836255.0,"10 years old, while jumping off the swing set into trampoline, lost balance before jumping, fell to ground. Right arm behind me. 3 compound, bone out of skin, fractures. The forearm bones touched the ground resulting in 5 very crazy sounding infections. 4 surgeries:initial fix, infection fix, plates out, and plastic surgery to better set the elbow scar for function. A pic line to treat infection. A month out of 7th grade. People think I was burned when they see them, but I've grown so used to having them I don't even notice."
