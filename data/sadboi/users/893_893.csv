AskReddit,fqb3qe9,t3_ghmbxg,1589230054.0,"Reader's digest: Know the legalities of fighting in your State for province, know how to throw a punch properly and learn you vague distance and what it feels like.

As someone who's been a sport fighter for many years of my life (started when I 3 now I'm 21), knows how to legally defend yourself is just as important. I got jumped and the only thing that saved me legally was the fact that the security camera saw me put my hands up defensively and say I don't want to fight, then he swung on me and I beat the shit out of him. (The cops didn't believe me till they saw the footage)

Remember when you punch you want to keep your fist and forearm tight and avoid bent arms and wrists if you connected with it they'll have less power and can hurt your wrist and hand. Aim to hit with the Knuckle of your fist and second finger.

Lastly get used to someone punching towards you so you know what it's like and can gauge distance of how far punches can travel it's less scary and easier to manage if you have seen a punch before.

Edit: always better to not fight though on the streets you run in to knives and guns in the ring you don't."

AskReddit,fpfn0ja,t3_gd3v7a,1588576407.0,"I think I saw a vision of my cousins death

I was driving back from my now ex girlfriends place late on a Thursday night and I kept replying this odd story in my mind as I drove that a motorcycle or atv kind of thing flipped over the median and smashed in the my car, it  pinned me to the driver seat of my car and I got super cold and called for dad which was weird cause I if I was injured I'd call mom dad works shift work and often can't answer the phone, eventually in the story in my head I ended up getting so cold I closed my eyes and it would repeat over and over again.

 it repeated till Saturday afternoon and then it stopped, it was literally all I thought about till Saturday. Saturday night I got a call from my mom, my cousin (the only one my age) had died in an avalanche he was found with his snow Mobile pinning him to a tree 3m under the snow he froze to death and after his friends called for help the first person they called was his dad because he was closer to him than his mom. To this day theres still some weird shit that happens that makes me believe in spirits and ghosts. (It's been a year and a bit since it happened).

Edit: Sorry it was late and I had work early, i didn't want to eaborate to much this is what else happened with that,

Then main thing was that, my late cousin was really in to trucks and cars, I worked on his truck with him when I could. And he actually taught me how drift actually while it was winter on the snow and ice I sat in the back right seat while is Friend sat in the front with him, eventually I got really in to cars and ended up Importing one from Japan I wanted to show him but he got a job in the oil Fields and I didn't get a chance, he.passed away right before I was going to go visit him again (he lives about 16hours away) after he passed away, I was driving that winter down the highway at night and I kept have vivid memories of him teaching me to drift so naturally I drifted down the empty highway at night, I kinda as if he was with me. When I got home and closed the car door the whole car was still covered in frost dispite the 30 minute drive, except one patch the size of a head over top of the back right seat that was completely thawed and frankly not that cold to the touch."
