podcasts,fpcg2ls,t3_gcda1c,1588499262.0,I really liked both of Stephen Fry's podcasts 'Seven Deadly Sins' and 'Great Leap Years'. He's good at researching and discussing but he also makes it clear when he is not an expert on something or when he expressing his opinion / sharing his experience. Plus he's very entertaining and charming.
childfree,fp8grbk,t3_gbzpcp,1588391888.0,"I couldn't agree with you more with banning kids from certain places. I worked in pubs for years and found it completely appalling how many kids where there everyday after school and all weekend, just because the parents wanted to get pissed with their friends. 

But I don't think all childfree people hate kids, I certainly don't. I guess it's with any grouping of people, you get some with extreme views within and you get outsiders who judge and stereotype. Try not to let it bother you though"

TrueOffMyChest,fozyfgv,t3_gaj353,1588199108.0,"I'd disagree that it is a sickness, because I think that implies there is a cure when there isn't. With many mental health issues you have to learn to live with them and how to deal with the symptoms of the disorder."
