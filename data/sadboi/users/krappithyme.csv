Sorry I know you didn't ask for this extra reply but I just finished the book and podcast so this is all fresh on my mind!!"
TrueCrime,feir4qx,t1_feii2g4,1579145115.0,"Yes, great show! The show is based on some history and some lore of the Hodel family, stop me if you've heard this...Fauna the main gal in the show was the real granddaughter abused by George in real life, her mother was Tamar Hodel, George's daughter who he abused and impregnated when she was 14. He went to trial in LA for incest after Tamar brought him up on charges! LAPD was corrupt in the 30s and 40s, George had mafia ties and money. He bribed jurors and cops to cover him despite male and female witnesses testifying who participated in her exploitation! He had the gravitas and wealth to get acquitted with eyewitnesses. Then he up and left for the Phillipines. Tamar was severely damaged, and she told people her own Dad was the B.D. killer and would kill her. 

An expert analyst determined GHH had the same handwriting as the B.D. notes that taunted police. This was in Steve Hodel's book B.D. Avenger about his dad (he's Tamar's bro from another mom). If you like true crime its fascinating and not leaving room for much doubt that George was a sadistic sociopath with no boundaries for any hedonistic activity.  

Fun fact: Chinatown the film took part of the Hodel incest story for its plot and get this; John Huston's first ex wife Dorothy married George Hodel who was one of John Huston's best friends. For a DIABOLICAL ride, the podcast Root of Evil is narrated by Fauna Hodel descendants and they talk of their shared toxic upbringings with a guy everyone treated like God who had weird friends, weird parties and very probably killed a few women along the way.

The jealous, narcissistic types, they love to ruin holidays, your nights out with friends, can't handle not possessing you for the object you are to them, make up cheating/scandal scenarios to use as justification to abuse, am I right? Your dude sounds lethal and unfit for domestic life just like mine was. They cant be saved, understood or helped because they are mentally unwell, incapable of healthy attachments. They charm their way into everyone's hearts and pants like champions, but their emotional IQ is stunted at toddler cave man stage forever. He was probably abused himself or was overtly coddled and spoiled as a child but that's another thread on the dangers of bad parenting. Men like them end up in jail or dead because they always go too far. Prison is full of narcissists with rage so intense they kill; you are lucky to be alive.

In addition to the necessity of a protection order and changed locks, you must go completely 'grey rock', block him on all channels, block his flying monkeys, change your passwords that he knew or could guess, think about relocating or getting a roommate. Possibly sue him for trauma and your therapy bills? Theres a statute of limitations to do so. I missed out on the 2 year window to sue my abuser and it's my only regret. He is still paying my medical restitution bills at nearly 20k so I felt slightly vindicated. I would have liked him to pay me for all my long term suffering too. He got off light, they all do. 

Victim's advocates in your state/city are out there to offer you free professional consoling and advice. Give them your police report number or proofs of medical bills so they can review your unique case and potentially release some funds to help you through this, pay for your therapy or bills even. I saw a crime victims funded therapist for a year and it was difficult at times but vital to my evolution over the grief/pain/shame. 

Calling out an abuser publicly is easily one of the most stressful things a traumatized person can do, because you are in fear and just want the discomfort to ""go away. Find a therapist who specializes in DV or trauma. Dont put it off, know that early processing of your feelings can prevent masking behaviors later on with substances or prevent complex ptsd. Dont seek closure with your abuser. The protection order does that for you. Avoiding dealing with your shaken core is the worst thing you could do to yourself. Take each step you can now and in near future to secure your safety and rebuild your self esteem, rebuild your grey matter with sleep, exercise, water and fish oils and lean on the people you love and/or trust. Dont isolate yourself to deal alone. The more you say outloud the faster you will be moving on, trust me. I first told police, then hospital staff, then the judge for the protection order, then my family, then my boss, then my friends, etc. Took me two days to tell everyone. I was able to remove the stress of hiding my shame by being honest and asking for time/safety/support instead of using my energy faking my stability. I was numb and in shock for a few weeks/months but my humanity was brought back to life by the good people surrounding me. I kept taking small steps forward out of his grasp and into legal defensive mode. I compiled all my evidence, helped the prosecutor obtain my sealed medical files, made a timeline of his abuses. Researched my situation. Learned. Lived better. Ate better. Exercised better. Rose up like a fucking Phoenix from the ash! Eventually, 7 months later when I faced my abuser in court I read a lengthy but emotionally charged victim impact statement and I nailed it. My ex got a fairly harsh sentence in an urban big city court that might have let him skate. Compile your evidence, tell your story, regret nothing you did, learn from what happened and heal. 

Find your safest route through this, but make no mistake, you can get through this. You do not deserve to live in fear or walk on eggshells in this one life. Not for anyone. You are a miraculous specimen who deserves love, mutual respect and appreciation. Get your power back, girl. It takes time but there are tons of supportive articles written by victims like us on quora.com (search narcissistic abuse cycles, grey rock method, healing from abuse) which meant everything to me as I came out of the lonesome abuse fog, it helped me feel less isolated and separate from the world. Sorry this was long, I get going sometimes on this topic. I hope you get the kind of help you need most. XO"

He may not be sorry for what he did to you, but a narcissist can feel hurt, cornered and public exposure is a fantastic way to bring them extreme discomfort."

serialkillers,f7brrew,t3_dv0ydu,1573576121.0,"He was captain of his St. Clements, Michigan high school football team where he was a very popular honors student. He had many dates with the ladies, but was reportedly angry all the time and had beaten up his older unmarried sister when she became pregnant. He showed one face to the public and a devious, demented face to women in private. 

My father, a retired Michigan State Police Lieutenant, spoke to some of the investigating detectives from the MSP on that case and there's details the public doesnt know, such as that JNC ejaculated on the dead bodies of his female victims. He has never admitted to what he did. He refuses to allow his DNA to exonerate him from the crimes and he did try to escape his remote Upper Peninsula prison cell at least once.

JNC is and always will be a disarmingly charming, dangerous sociopath incapable of remorse or responsibility."

I was enormously affected  by light smoking at night, when I say light I mean 1 or 2 puffs and that was it. I always felt my fight or flight hyper awareness and muscle fatigue subside and allow my mind to wander aimlessly and free like it used to before the assault. It was liberation from anguish and strained stability within reach, in ways that didnt numb me. I could focus on a film or a magazine for a little while under the influence, I could generate new neural synapses instead of retracing the old frayed and frightened ones. The onset of PTSD symptoms were scary for me, debilitating especially as I was doing my best to continue working full time in a well known national banking institution and raise 2 kids by myself. Smoking pot once a day or every couple days kept me from going crazy in my newly solo parenting life while dealing with lawyers, police, child support hearings and all the courtroom dramas that did their damndest to retraumatize me. Marijuana allowed me to process my pain. It absolutely helped me, it diminished my trauma's power. 

It's not the end all be all cure for everyone but it's much preferable to endless pharma trials with untold side effects. I had everything to lose and weed gave me my life back."
domesticviolence,f6mcp9s,t3_drx0zt,1572970633.0,"Also, it helps immensely to read third party articles on quora.com about narcissistic abuse cycles, choking, coercive control from psychologists and other victims. You are sadly among many who have also experienced the gradual increase of abuse after head-scratching and thinking it's not ""so bad"" yet. YET. Please avoid the trap and pain of push-pull DV dynamics with this guy, it will soon ruin your ability to think straight, sleep, eat, and that's just the start of a coercive, controlling relationship which feels like a narcotic to your impressionable love struck brain. They wear you down, they take your confidence, they are jealous of your success and steal your sunshine, which is the path of every narcissistic man in their quest to elevate themselves and own you as their possession.

Please sever ties with him, he will surely react with malice if you do this privately so ensure you are in a public safe space to kick him to the curb. He mentioned you being weak; show him he had it all wrong and move on and glow up from this with a more supportive, hotter and smarter man than he who let's you do you, steamy sex scenes and all.

domesticviolence,f3xksvy,t3_dipixt,1571239919.0,"Your concerns are completely valid. He is apparently not satisfied to abstain from contact. I agree with the police, he is testing waters. It doesn't appear jail or a protective order would stop his need to control or manipulate you or your friends. Already reaching out to your friend on day 1 out of jail is a big red flag from my perspective. You dont think like an abuser so you can only guess his motives but if you have an uneasy feeling about his motives I'd say trust your gut. If the police see you working with them and not enabling this guy that helps your case too. 

Can you switch gyms due to his membership there? Can you change your routine? Install cameras outside the perimeter of your home? Install a camera inside your home? Put security stickers on your windows and doors? Change your locks? Buy a taser? Please protect yourself and prevent his abuse in cooperation with police as much as you can. I had my parents come stay with me for several weeks after I filed a protective order, I was afraid for my life. My dad helped secure my home for me and helped me see clearly I needed additional protection. This is a statistically dangerous time for you, please be careful."
domesticviolence,f3tlpuo,t1_f3pisqy,1571139148.0,"Therapy, which was given to me by the state after I filed charges, was a gamechanger for me into accepting and processing the abuse. I had my hospital take injury photos (get them taken by a cop or hospital to make official record a judge will believe over iPhone pics) works super well as leverage in future legal matters against an insidious person like this. They will deny deny deny and point finger at the victim. Only THEY can be a victim in their sick mind! 

Documenting the behavior is very well and good (helps to look back at it when missing the 'good' side of the abuser, which is just a mask) and it can be entered and read by lawyers or police as evidence if there will be a future court or police interaction. It's better to leave the abuser ASAP and not bring about increased trauma and go completely grey rock before the violence escalates to that point if there wont be any legal maneuvers. Talking to a DV counselor on a hotline or a therapist could help you make s plan. Waiting for the next shoe to drop and physical abuse to happen again will make a person sick, anxious, etc. Telling a therapist or trusted person with credibility your full story to call upon for legal backup can go a long way too if charges are ever pressed, when it's your word against a narcissist (or borderline p.d.) it is their passionate word against yours, and they will make insane things up just to win against their victim and on top of it lack any remorse for their outrageous lies. My ex narc-borderline brought his family to court to testify against me and make up stories and the court still believed me because I had a paper trail of complaints and 911 calls filed with police, my daughter and neighbor came to court as witnesses at the ready, I also had never been to multiple psych wards nor had I multiple DUIs or arrests for impersonating people on my record like my ex did. Pretty easy to see he was capable of lies on paper, but most of these narcissists have no paper trail yet if they are young. You see these people fail miserably by their late 30s, 40s and collapse into utter failure after exhausting all relationships in their 50s. 

Traumatic, abusive behavior is unfortunately completely normal and pathological to a narcissist or a person who grew up in a home with that behavior. They tend to treat all intimate partners this same hateful, rageful way after the love bombing stage and do anything to prevent accountability or recognition of their guilt. Read, read, read and talk, talk, talk it out loud with a trusted adult or therapist to make your plan to get safe and healthy from this guy. The leaving is the hardest thing, once you're gone, you get GONE FOR GOOD (GREY ROCK)!"
domesticviolence,f3prgoz,t3_dhqapp,1571063849.0,"You poor dear. He's ratcheting up his abuse to you and it WILL CONTINUE TO ESCALATE. The pattern is unmistakeable to me, I see it clearly as another DV victim. Get out now, please, before the trauma bonds with him are stronger than heroin to your malleable young brain. Do NOT, I repeat, DO NOT INVEST YOUR CARE, LOVE AND SELF ESTEEM INTO SOMEONE WHO IS DISPLAYING ALL THE RED FLAGS OF AN ABUSER. Carefully remove yourself from his world. Recognize how terrible he makes you feel, the sinister nature of his control and manipulation, the different masks he wears in public or private.  I am at work and cant type very long, so I would recommend you check out some very similar postings on Quora.com from survivors of DV and narcissistic abuse. Search those terms, search ' 'narcissistic abuse patterns' and read up on how to go 'grey rock' to protect yourself and deescalate, learn about 'hoovering', 'devaluation', and recovering from an abusive relationship. When I was at my rock bottom, and before I had a therapist to talk to, Quora really helped me to feel less alone and armed me with validation that my experiences were real and abusive."
TrueCrimeDiscussion,f38atnd,t1_f335moe,1570734969.0,"This is gonna be long. Sorry. I'm illustrating that I've lived it and survived it, I now see the disorder and the way it manifests. I think npd and bpd are more common than people believe (10-15% of all Americans) and i think armchair diagnosis is not helpful in most cases, high profile true criminals notwithstanding, but with some people it's fairly obvious when looking at the patterns of their behavior, especially as it relates to intimate relationships. I'm no Dr. but I have been to therapy with two psychiatrists ever since the person I was hoodwinked by and close to murdered by trauma bonded me so hard I could barely get away. I needed answers about what happened to me. The fog and disbelief clung to me until I read up on cluster b behavior patterns in relationships. I also relied heavily on answers from trained professionals and other victims like me. Our stories are eerily similar. I've gleaned a TON about cluster b and how it manifests and I validate my own experiences because I'm no easy mark, I'm educated, open minded and yet I was captivated and victimized by a man wearing a mask. He played vulnerable to my caring nature and I naively tried to help him while it nearly ended my own life to try to save his. 

My two licensed therapists agreed my hellish tales of his behavior accurately depict a whirlwind with a raging male borderline, possibly a comorbid narcissist. I did my own sleuthing with his exes he despised for ""abandoning"" him (his actual word - a borderline term if ever there was one) and learned the real history of his verbal and physical brutality towards all of them, but also of his luring them back with love bombing, gaslighting. The substance binges he would go on to numb his inner turmoil were scary AF, the recklessness with vehicles, with money, with his body all shocking to witness, seeming out of character until it became a pattern. His lies and pathological selfishness, emotional swings, imprisonment, ability to cut beloved people from his life abruptly begin to pave the way to the diagnosis. After living in close quarters I saw him gaslight, deflect, invent paranoid delusions he would use to justify abuse, blow entire paychecks on Nikes or jewelry when his 3 children needed him, and the mask he wore in public would often fall off in favor of abusive rage episodes directed only at loved ones at home that only served to lessen his self loathing as he projected accusation and paranoid delusions onto innocents. The push and pull love or hate was normal to him, it's all he understood, but it caused every relationship with him to unravel. He tried to be stable but would fail baxkwards the more he tried to stabilize. Minor stress would make him break and binge hard liquor until blackout.

My ex, the smartest and most handsome man I had ever met, refused any diagnosis and he's had as many variations of diagnosis as he has had psychiatrists and therapists which are too numerous to count. PTSD, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, substance abuse disorder being just a few in the last few years of his 30s when I was with him. He refuses to believe anything is wrong or abnormal in his mind. He forgets entire days and loses time, cannot recall events when he was in a different state of mind. Believe me that I ensured he not only met just the minimum of 5 required criteria in the DSM-5, he met ALL NINE, before I diagnosed him myself (down to his hearing and seeing people who are not there = psychosis) and I've witnessed them all, the extreme binge eating, the promiscuity, the pathological lies that were easy to disprove and in hindsight I see all the evident patterns and know his childhood abuse traumatized him to the point it caused his behaviors and shattered personality. He was triggered to suicidal ideation and drug induced benders just by SEEING a therapist. Multiple times. His trauma carried over into every facet of his life, and every life who tried to love him. He was fired from every job for flipping out and threatening to harm people but if you ask him, nothing is his fault, he's never accountable, he tells very plausible stories painting himself as victim, always. Dr Jeckyl/Mr Hyde every day, putting all close relations through the vicious abuse cycle after the ideation phase. Devaluations from him are unlike anything I've ever seen, violent tirades of terror, spewing obscenities and hate at anyone in his path. He enjoys torturing his family and children only when he's in that rage zone. His demeanor was frighteningly evil but when his rage subsided by relocating it to someone else, he was visibly diminished, depressed and gentle for days if not a week or two afterward. Then the ideation turned to rage and hatred again. Cycle repeated ad naseum. The patterns never wavered, always consistent. 

He finally split me conpletely to black and has hated my guts ever since he beat me to a pulp almost killing me for my demand that we live apart and he get professional help if he wanted to continue seeing me or his son without supervision. I thought a ultimatum would scare him straight, it made him homicidal. That was the impetus for him to attempt to kill me. He was making threats to my life even after police were on the scene to witness, he has no control over himself at all or didnt care. He went back to the psych ward and I got a protective order once and for all. The injuries I suffered for wanting his abuse to stop were extensive and horrible. My lip will never heal back to normal. My brain is permanently fucked. I have PTSD. To this day he believes I caused it all to happen and that he is the real victim. He smeared me to everyone in our shared realm. When someone struggles with who they are, mood stability, reacts with unreasonable rage, assaults innocent children, assaults a pregnant girlfriend, drinks and drugs uncontrollably when triggered, has multiple suicidal hospitalizations in psych wards per year, is jailed for assaults, jailed for 3 separate DUIs in 5 years, cannot hold a job more than a month of his entire life but projects a constant false image to the world of a vulnerable sweet man who loves his family he abuses, something is beyond the norm and the consistent patterns of his messy life do absolutely paint a picture of a clear cluster b disorder if not more than one disorder.

I rambled a lot and don't know how to short answer this at all, but I could write a novel on this topic. I'm only on reddit for memes and to connect with people who were victimized by these disordered people, trying to heal by exposing the patterns I personally found."
