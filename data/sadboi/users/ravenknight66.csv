So.

This is shocking.

Especially because the victim was intellectually impaired - she had the mental age of a 10-year-old and this meant she trusted people naively.

I do know it's very common for people with this kind of disability to be absolutely  gentle souls.

They might not have the same learning, thinking and abstraction abilities as we do, but they sure are very nice and are always willing to give and accept love. Unconditionally.

This is why this case is more than a horrible crime.

It would be terrible enough even if the victim had had a normally developed intelligence level. Six against one, what was wrong with them?

But doing \_this\_ with a mentally handicapped person - a person who had neither the ability nor the willingness to hurt anyone?

Senseless.

I don't get this wannabe-attitude either. It seems to be common in other subcultures too. I experienced exactly the same in black metal terms some years ago. (And my love  says the very same goes in metal, globally!) 

I got the impression that it's way too easy to copy the clothing style without any understanding of the inspiration or the attitudes. The elitism or gatekeeping accusations sound familiar, too. Isn't it interesting that those who give such labels are the ones who strive to be oh, so special and oh, so extreme?

And yeah, I would always say the very same to wannabes what you are saying about goths! (There are only two slight differences: in black metal subculture, it was more common to hang out in desolate forests or other depressive places instead of half empty clubs, and drinking way too much beer was ""Teh Norm"". I would ask this question: what is cool about that? We are social retards who don't know what to do with our lives.)

I see how many people claim to be goths jut to seem to be ""edgy"" as you say. They don't really seem to understand the concept of dark music. It is not necessarily a ""rebel"" thing. Most goths I know are very, very peaceful people and they don't listen to this music genre just to be different or to shock those square mainstream people.

I am very interested in what the religious r/TrueCrime users think about this detail (hoping it's not an offensive question)!

BTW, I know a very similar story from Denmark. The guy's name is Steen Lassen and he did the very same thing in 2010: after his private firm failed, he had much debt, mortgage on his luxury house - and his wife lost her job too, he decided it's an action of love to kill his whole family, to save them from poverty and humiliating situations.

Strange enough, there is a special detail the two cases have in common. 

List - after having shot everyone who was at home - drove his son home from the match. And killed him.

Lassen did the very same: after having beaten and stabbed his wife and one of his daughters to death, drove his younger daughter from school. And stabbed her to death.

He claimed he'd wanted to kill himself too, but the police did not buy this story: his attempt to run into a truck with his car was not serious, he had practically no chance to die. He received a life sentence, AFAIK with no possibility for parole.

I don't know how about you, but a person I would describe as ""ugly"" is not someone who does not look like a movie star or a supermodel - but someone who might look good but says ugly, bad, dishonest things; someone who hurts others (and cowardly says ""It was just a joke!""); someone who looks down on those who are less lucky.

If you don't want to live the rest of your life like this, and you don't wish to actually risk your life, this is a very good sign. It shows that you have enough self-respect to think you deserve something better than this and that you need to live.

I do think re-learning to eat normally is only one part - an important part - of recovery. 

A good therapist might help you with developing better coping methods, understanding what lies beneath your restrictive symptoms, and learning  how not to project everything you feel onto food and refusing to eat. This is very important! 

From my own experience I can tell you that one might be symptomfree - or might \_pretend to be\_ symptomfree - for years while still having the anorexic mindset, and as such, you risk relapse when something triggering happens.

This is why I suggest that you should find a really good psychologist or doctor. I know how difficult it is to find one who is competent enough!
