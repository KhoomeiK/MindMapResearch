Nobody is going to come to you to help you, as unfortunate as that is. People are just people. You have to go ask for help, and ask for help before you need it. I hope you can feel the community of veterans dealing with distress behind you, we're here and we're all this together.

Vets4warriors is always available for you to call for exactly that situation you were in. Give them a call, they actually care about you and they've all been in combat and may be dealing with similar issues."
bipolar,fmyohuv,t3_fy2r30,1586491267.0,"I'm also 25 (M) and bipolar. Relationships are tricky and my advice certainly may not be right for you but here goes.

I found myself in a string of relationships for a while and noticed a trend that I was depending on my girlfriends to balance my emotional state. I also felt misunderstood and like I wasnt living up to their expectations. Now I intentionally will not be in a relationship. I still go on dates, I still - if we're attracted to each other - have sex, I still form connections with people.

The main difference from then to now is I'm upfront that I'm not in a headspace for a serious relationship, and it would be nice to just form a friendship with them. The boundary of friendship makes it much easier not to become dependent on them for full blown emotional support. It also makes it easier to get to know the other person with less pressure.

If you're anything like me you may have felt ashamed of our condition or like you owe others an explanation. You don't. You can share as much or as little as you want. The expectations or judgements of others can certainly be troubling. However when you come across the right people, they will accept you just as you are, with no need to explain yourself or feel inadequate. I have found a few of those people and hands down it was worth the struggle.

Also just remember dating is difficult for everyone, and like anything it takes practice, and mistakes to learn. Good luck and I hope my story helps a bit!"

After my mental health started to decline due to base lockdown for 18 months, I was literally told to sit down and shut up by my boss. Then the mental health counselor I saw fell apart in our first meeting because his wife and kids were getting sent away. Not only that, I have no idea how many people I am responsible for the deaths of from continuing to do my job while I internally fell apart.

Going in and chatting with someone only helps if done early, and support is actually available. Otherwise, for many of us, it's medication and disability pay until we die."

unsolicited advice: just make sure not to get too caught up in your own personal story so you can witness all the wonders around you. majority of people you meet are also traveling and therefore more open minded and easy to talk to. plus you can change environments whenever you see fit. personally, I feel most at peace on islands because there is no social pressure to be someone or something you're not."

Currently filing a secondary condition claim off of the anxiety and depression for PTSD, Agorophobia, sleep disturbance, IBS, headache, stress disorder, chronic fatigue, and manic-depressive reaction.

I'm honestly in rough shape, and have been for a while but didn't believe in asking for help from the VA until recently. Just not sure how to pinpoint the source of my issues as I'm not a doctor but I know I haven't been the same since combat, everyone around me says so. Definitely not currently able to work consistently or maintain relationships. Doubting it will get much better.

Veterans,f9htiti,t1_f9hqe8m,1575321443.0,"Yes I agree. I've been out 3 years and I traveled for a total of about 2 of them, central and south america, asia, europe. By the end was desensitized to seeing new things, meeting new people. Was just staying in hostels partying every day and it started to feel pretty meaningless. Since then I moved back home to be there for family and friends, have a relationship, a house, a dog. Still no job though. Tried school, hated it. My disabilities make it difficult to work. I'm glad I got out even though I didn't have a choice. The only thing is, it's hard to feel fulfilled, feels like lacking a purpose. Went from all work no play in the service, to all play no work out of the service. Maybe balance is the answer. Maybe love is the answer. Maybe there is no answer and this is just how it feels. It's a weird thing to have a whole community of veterans feeling lonely or cut off. Seems like we ought to be able to all help each other. Traveling is fun though and when I'm going somewhere has been the most normal I've felt since. Thanks for sharing."
