From my experience you have to learn how to be happy and complete on your own and learn how to live without the other person even if it hurts. You have to accept the fact that it's over, that life can be very hard sometimes, but you're still very young and when you're ready you will be able to meet a lot of new people and find another person to live and share your life with.
