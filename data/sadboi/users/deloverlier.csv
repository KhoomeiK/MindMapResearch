If you don’t mind, when you say the public transit’s not great, is it usable if needed from around the city or really only functional in certain areas?  Or is there generally parking around if you have a car?

Thanks again for the time and info!"

mice,f6g256q,t3_dp3crt,1572820881.0,"Just a heads up if you haven’t yet—r/petmice is less a mix of critter/computer and could get a larger response.

I’m sorry you’re going through this—I’ve been in a similar situation and it’s not something I’d wish anyone to see. My personal advice would be to make sure the heat lamp isn’t sending heat directly at the mice, as they can overheat fairly easily, and just play around with proximity, noting the temperature, to find a good place for them.  Mice are generally social, so a friend or two (not too much additional cleanup and less of a sudden loneliness if one of them passes unexpectedly) is likely a good idea with proper time isolating them in separate airspace’s to prevent the spread of any disease. 

If possible, a check up at the vet for your current mouse can’t hurt in case the cause of death was contagious. And just lots of love and attention until you can introduce a friend. 

Good luck!"
