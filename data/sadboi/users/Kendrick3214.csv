Tahmkenchmains,eq43qzx,t3_bx7cu6,1559768592.0,"hmm that does not seem like a huge nerf, i think he is still gonna be quite the opressive champ in top lane, which is good... i can still enjoy him, for some reason they decided to nerf the ally range, further killing sup tahm kench, than nerfing top tahm kench, oof."
dauntless,eq10849,t1_eq0vwv3,1559698371.0,"hopefully they are going to add support, they said they were going to do something about it a year ago, and sadly nothing yet, but best thing that we can do is hope haha"
dauntless,eq0vo7t,t1_eq0vb28,1559695443.0,"the only fix that worked for me is by changing resolution, it didnt help much because it is still glitched, but at least i can equip the cells, best thing you can do is change the resolution"
