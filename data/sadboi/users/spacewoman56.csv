And it is depressing.  All I want is time to chill and not worry about the everything that needs to be done that day.  I'm not asking for much.

shelties,fk2tx8g,t3_fg71lw,1583809082.0,"We had to put Rory to sleep just over a month ago. He was only 8. Found out he had cancer and there was nothing else we could do for him. He was my first dog. I’m the one who trained him, took care of him, and walked him. He always was waiting at the door for me when I came home. (I also have 2 cats. They don’t wait. I usually see them in an hour or so.  Cats ugh.)

My son is six and still asks for Rory every day. It breaks my heart. I have such a hole in my heart. He was the best dog. The picture above was when he was happy and healthy. That is how I am going to remember him."

relationship_advice,fjpilkx,t3_fef04y,1583551778.0,"I had something like this happen to me.  My job was moved to Texas.  If I moved I would get a 25% raise and they would have paid for the move.  I really wanted to go.  My husband refused.  He claimed, like yours, that he needed to stay by his family.  He also claimed that he did not like the political climate in Texas.  He was also worried about finding a job.  (He works in IT, he easily could have because it was a tech heavy area.)  

Many of the statements about resenting your husband if you don't take the promotion and move is true.  Not a day goes by that I don't kick myself in the butt for not doing it.  I had medical reasons for wanting to move too.  My health is not as well as it would have been down there.  Financially, we are struggling.  My husband's job here, has turned into a dead end job, and he pretty much refuses to find another because he is comfortable where he is at.  

Just like you I value my marriage.  I also don't take it lightly.  It is something that my husband and I commented to before we even got married.  I was also the one to bend to make our marriage work.  (That has been starting to change because I'm just not doing it anymore.)  I really feel that he did not want to get out of his comfort zone.  That he was afraid of going out on a limb.  He sees his family less then I do and mine live an hour away.  He will never give me the real reason.  

I still say go.  He will come along if he really loves and respect you and values his family (you and the kids).  Don't make the same mistake I have.  Everyday, I regret my choice."

downsyndrome,f1g78dd,t3_d9a0gb,1569461382.0,"Congratulation on you new baby!  My son is almost 6.  He had a couple markers for Down syndrome so we had further testing done so that we could be prepared for his arrival.  I'm very glad we did that.  We still were not really prepared when he arrived.  We knew he had a hole in his heart  that would have to be repaired surgically and that he also had problems with his kidneys.  We were also informed that there was a 50/50 chance of him ending up in the NICU.  He did end up in the NICU.

The thing that surprised me after his birth was how much is thrown at you about his issues.  It was completely overwhelming.  We were aware of everything before hand.  Had everything explained to us, but the amount of doctors that visit you those first days is crazy.  It is really hard to process all of the information and situations they give you.  The best thing you can do is trust your gut at this point.  You will know what is right.

The good news is that my son's heart is fixed (the surgery went way better then expected) and he is starting to grow out of some of his kidney issues.  He has had other issues including loss of hearing, sleep apnea, and glasses.  

The best thing about my son, is that I love him more then I ever thought possible.  It makes all the issues he has had seem small.  He has a huge personality and a love of life I wish I had.  He is behind his peers in many things but he is progressing well.  I know he will have a great life and that is all I want for him.  The good out weighs the bad.  Your child is just that, a child first and foremost.  

I read a book called *Gifts: Mothers Reflect on How Children with Down Syndrome Enrich Their Lives* when I was pregnant.  It was so up lifting and showed how normal life is with a child with Down syndrome.  I still pick it up from time to time."

People with Down syndrome do have a tendency to be shorter in stature due to the 3rd division of the 21 chromosome.  Most have low muscle tone.  It's just part of having Down syndrome.  They are able to feel full like anyone else.  Also like anyone else they can continue to choose to keep eating even if they are full. In reality, they are more like ""normal people"" then they are not.  Strike up a conversation with a person who has Down syndrome or their family some time.  You will be surprised."

I point out to him that I have told him what that I have said it before.  I'm not sure if it is lack of paying attention (because he is always staring at his phone) or if he really did not hear me.  It is frustrating.  I've gotten to the point that I have started saying never mind because I am sick of repeating myself two or three times.  I don't have time for that.

He loves school and the social aspect is a must.  I can't wait till he goes back to school because I know he is bored at home.  I try to keep him busy, but I can not offer the stimulation that school does.  And there is nothing wrong with being ""that"" parent.  You have to fend for your kids."

And for the life of him, he can’t figure out where the fridge filters went. 😁

Other times I just pick up the item. Hold it up in front of him and ask where it goes. Then I hand it to him. 

He gets so mad at me. But he doesn’t say anything.  I’m not his maid, I’m not his mom. I’m his partner.  We also have a 5 year old with special needs. So I don’t have time to take care of his stuff too. His a flipping adult. He needs to act like one."

We mourned the life that we thought our child was going to have.  Even 5 years later I think of us missing the ""normal"" life from time to time.  Honestly though, I wouldn't want to have him any other way.  He has taught me so much about life; how to slow down and see things from a different perspective.  I'm not going to say it's easy, but it is well worth it.  They are still your child and you will love them just as fiercely.  I highly recommend reading the poem ""Welcome to Holland."""

Not a day goes by that I question what I have done for him.  I think it's our lot in life as moms to question everything.
