When I start obsessing over body checking when I go by mirrors, or comparison to other body types, I force myself to think of a random song line, or I go over my daily to-do list in my head on repeat a few times, or I focus on a story thought for some random project. It seems to help a bit in the moment to redirect my thoughts to something unrelated and give me a new mental track to follow."

Howrse,fov85di,t1_fosbz31,1588096943.0,"Agreed on the changes, I left before I knew about the overhaul and it was a huge learning curve (and mildly infuriating) seeing the dramatic difference with the pass system and how they're suddenly taxing sales now which seems redundant to me.

I found that after I got a couple of passes for pegasus to sort of kickstart, play has settled out to be more relaxed and fun for passing the time, it's just not easy to start out brand new without passes as it used to. It feels less community friendly"
tumblr,fnc7ik5,t1_fnc0ods,1586830284.0,"A lot of jobs in specific fields require you to have prior work experience in that field, even for the lowest rung entry level position. When you can’t even get in at the bottom of the company for a paid position people are forced into unpaid internships in order to get that experience, and to get a foot in the company door in competitive fields. 

It has nothing to do with pride, it’s about being able to work in a field you have a passion for, and paid a shitton of money to be able to work in. The one in the wrong isn’t the employee, it’s the companies who build that system precisely to force people to work for free for them. They get unpaid labour that’s specialized in the field, to work a position that an employee with experience gets good money for. It’s exploitation, and when entire industries are controlled by companies that capitalize on it, employees aren’t left with many options. 

No one can really afford life on waiting tables, they don’t get paid enough to begin with, and there aren’t enough restaurants in the country to support everyone forced to go through an unpaid internship."

Are you building the world for something along the lines of a video game or novel?"
