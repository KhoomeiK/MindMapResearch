But not with weed anymore. 
It’s sugar this time. 

I went through a lot of relapses but haven’t had the urge to consume cannabis since 4 months ago and trust me when I say I feel so much stronger and secure in my own skin and not looking back. I used to think weed helped me connect with others but it was only temporarily. Throughout these past few months I’ve been able to, soberly, connect with our humanity little by little and especially during these times when I’m isolated I long for sober genuine human connection once again and it’s quite a beautiful yet “sobering” feeling. To just feel. The sadness, the hope, being completely present in my feelings and knowing I am alive and HERE in this present moment. 

I’ve been on a new journey since then (I’m on a roll now!) to continue to do what’s best for me and my future self. I’ve been trying to cut down on sugar intake for years, which is another addiction I’ve been struggling with since my teens that has greatly affected my mood and overall life in a similar way as weed did. Temp highs, long lasting lows. Now I’ve cut out about 90% of my sugar intake since going into self-quarantine and OMG it is so much harder then weed because it’s all around me and it’s a socially accepted drug. My family is aware of my decision and they tease me by bringing home cakes and treats and all sorts of yummy sweets. Every time I want to throw in the towel I close my eyes, take a deep breath, and remind myself of the feeling that followed after indulging myself. The regret. The high and then the crashing low. The self talk. The continuous viscous cycle that kept me a powerless prisoner to my vices. I open my eyes and smile because I know I am stronger than my temptations. I laugh because I am growing more powerful through these challenges life has set for me knowing I am on the path to a life full of richness and health and wonder. 

... My family probably thinks I’ve lost it laughing to myself in the corner, but little do they know what is going on on the inside... 

WE’VE GO THIS!!!"
intermittentfasting,fkobydb,t3_fjl9xn,1584384153.0,"Congrats! Already looking great, you’re only going to look that much greater at your goal weight!

Really glad I saw your post this morning. I’m the same height as you but with a SW of 157. I’ve been on a strict plant-based + fish keto diet and IF 16:8 since 10 days ago and weighed the same this morning, though my stomach has definitely flattened a bit and I feel overall much better. Instantly felt defeated and wanted to throw in the towel but seeing your progress over 2 months reminds me that I need to commit to this longer than just 10 days. 

Let’s do this!!"

bipolar,f7euh72,t3_dvrc6p,1573666073.0,Dude congrats!!! This accomplishment is going to transfer over to many of the endeavors you pursue in the future. The act of pushing through when your entire being wants to quit is what life is all about. I was so close to dropping out 6 months from graduation when the illness had me in such a dark hole. We are so much stronger than we realize. Excited for your journey because you have the strength and willpower to accomplish all your wildest dreams ✨

Just yesterday I was driving on the freeway and I just sat in silence, which up until recently was really hard for me to do, and I felt so extremely connected with everything. Idk how to describe it, but I just “opened myself up” and the tears started to flow and I couldn’t stop them. I cried for the state of our world, for the suffering of humankind, and for my own suffering. But it wasn’t horrible though, it was just... beautiful. I got such peace and acceptance afterwards with a feeling like “this is life itself and it is perfect just the way it is”. Very similar to thoughts and feelings on a trip, yet I was completely sober. Then I startled laughing really hard imagining other people seeing me sob while driving LOL"

Soulnexus,f4rcprn,t3_dlkm6r,1571765814.0,"I feel this so much more strongly as I get older!

Since I was a little girl I have dreamt of fighting in battles or in post-apocalyptic events. I grew up preparing and waiting for this to happen. 

But in the last year, as I’ve been reading the Bible more (I am not religious at all, but more of a truth and wisdom seeker) I’ve been coming to the understanding that the battle is here and now. There’s a verse that reads:

 “For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.”
(Ephesians 6:12)

We face the battle everyday we are awake (and maybe even asleep?) against those who want to suppress and take away our and other people’s power. I recognized this was happening within my own family and in my networks and even out in public places. Slowly I started to confront these “dark forces” in others and have been gaining the courage to use my own voice to stop them from abusing myself and others. I believe there has always been an ongoing war for our souls and people try to abuse others to make them feel more powerful. At least, that’s what I felt like was the case until I started learning and recognizing the power within me, that God was inside of me and that I needed to tap into this power in order to free myself from bondage and slavery to others. And just like a real war, I have to make sure I’m alert and prepped every day to face the enemy because the second I let my guard down they sneak in like a soft whisper in my ear and I’m falling down the hole to darkness once again. 

But the key for me in all of this has been to never give up, because falling is inevitable, and to keep fighting as if the world depends on it."

Soulnexus,f4r1r5a,t3_dlj35v,1571761365.0,"I got the chills and teared up as I read this. Thank you for posting, I really needed to be reminded of this today. 

I feel like I’m constantly trying to “escape”, whether it be physically, emotionally, mentally, etc. but the few times I’ve felt like I’ve experienced “heaven”  were the times I was able to be in the present moment and hold the perspective that everything I was experiencing, the good and the ugly, was exactly where I needed to be in my journey of evolution and that alone made everything so fucking beautiful."
