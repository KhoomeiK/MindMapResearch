I was going to my Uni by metro and was lucky to get an empty seat. I remember it was a rush hour, and the train was pretty packed.

Next station the girl comes in, wearing a super short top and her belly was sticking out so much that i swear proportionally to her body it looked 100% like she is pregnant. She stood right in front of me. 

I immediately stood up, smiled at her and pointed to the seat (for her). 

And OMG the look she gave me...clearly not pregrant. 

I felt ashamed and stupid so i immediately got out at the next station. FML."

FFS dad blew it out of proportion. First of all the daughter is not 13, she is 17, next year she’ll be of legal age to decide for herself. Her mother simply wanted to make daughter happy so she could feel more confident. Weighed all pros and cons. 
And the filler will disappear in 6 months anyway!
