australia,fmaudak,t1_fm9o20h,1585908186.0,"Well ive considered testing  but i highly doubt it is COVID 19. The articles suggest that it can or could be a sign, but it is not definite sign. If symptoms persist of course ill be going to test but what people are failing to remember is that without the whole pandemic, this is a common time of year for individuals to be catching colds or even common stomach bugs.

Yes i agree that its a great way to provide entertainment to fans whilst they’re cooped up in their homes for however long this lasts, but at the same time it just seems like one big desperate move for the money, not the fans. Testing can only do so much like theres no prevention. If one player tests positive, it’ll be like a domino effect which will do more damage than keeping the game at a halt for the time being."

ROCD,fis4fmj,t1_firhjcr,1582677551.0,"RE: ""Turns out I'm afraid of my OCD""

I think i have the perfect article for you in regards to befriending fear. It is very normal to be afraid, especially when your anxiety is solely focused on a relationship that im sure means so much to you, however it is problematic when you are enabling this fear to control you and your relationship with your partner. I say this to everyone on here, at the end of the day YOU are in control of everything, no thoughts or feelings can ever over power you if you practice acceptance as well as practicing the power of CHOICE. When OCD hits you really hard, say to yourself ""you know what? im going to do the opposite of my thoughts and feelings, im going to love my partner regardless, im going to put in effort, i do value my relationship"" (positive affirmations you can say to yourself). At first it'll be difficult, but as you continue to practice that, you will feel so empowered.

NO, if anything its going to delay your recovery process. You cannot combat negativity with more negativity, like thats exactly what OCD feeds on, theres no grey area its always just the negatives. You need to be putting that energy into something proactive such as seeking professional support, instead of asking for reassurance from others on here or even from a professional, ask for strategies, ask how you can cope through this, dont continue to feed it!

Advice,ffxy6ja,t1_ffww0er,1580334738.0,"They're like this because i choose not to tell them about certain aspects of my life due to the fact that they behave like this even if i do. I even have them barging into my room as they please without knocking to see if id like them to come in, bugging me while im on phone calls, just being really disruptive and invasive."
ROCD,fftdy4q,t3_ev48o6,1580217722.0,"Don’t do that to yourself. By researching these things, you’re sabotaging your recovery process and delaying it. Always remind yourself that a CHOICE made by you and only you, is so much more powerful than any feeling or thought because feelings and thoughts come and go, but choices are something you can continue to make throughout your lifetime.  You’re in the thick of it right now, so it will be difficult to resist performing compulsions but it will benefit you in the long run 100%. You want your relationship to work? STRIVE FOR IT! Continue to choose to show love through action, choose to not be as influenced by your thoughts/feelings (takes practice), learn CBT or ERP and practice it, seek support from a professional and most importantly be easy on yourself!"

KobeBryant24,ffs76b6,t1_ffs6oc9,1580174809.0,I think you should have some respect for the people grieving and keep your opinions to yourself.
KobeBryant24,ffs64av,t1_ffs4jhd,1580174078.0,"Understandable, however you’re wrong in the way you’ve approached this. Have a little respect, a man and his daughter along with other parents and their children have passed so show some decency and keep your opinions to yourself. You’re putting your time and energy into something unhelpful, like this isn’t doing anyone any good right now."

KobeBryant24,ffrz1u8,t1_ffqqeo4,1580169180.0,"How is it wasting their time? They have a passion for it, so they’ve pursued it and made it a career, that isn’t a waste of time as far as im concerned. Role models can be anyone, it does not matter what they do for a living, they clearly have the qualities and values that someone appreciates and lives by. I think the problem with society is people like yourself, who are closed minded and constantly putting others down. The only thing ive seen from you on this sub is negativity, like why waste your time coming onto a Kobe Bryant sub only to say hurtful things? If you don’t like him as an individual, why shit on others who clearly see him as someone they can look
up to, someone they aspire to be like."
