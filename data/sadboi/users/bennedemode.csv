[Nanne Grönvall - Håll Om Mig](https://youtu.be/u-oGauv_4a0)

This is one of my all-time childhood memories and it won the televote for a reason. I would have preferred this over Martin.

•2006

[BWO - Temple of Love](https://youtu.be/h1XwM_XN1ys)

I like Carola’s entry and I’m glad she competed that year with a catchy song. It was a bit outdated though.


•2007

[Måns Zelmerlöw - Cara Mia](https://youtu.be/-N39OfjGv8c)

To be honest, I actually think Måns should have won this year. I wasn’t too fond of Heroes and still not, but this song was just so good. Everyone remembers and hummed on this one, it’s unbelieveable that The Ark managed to get through.

•2008

[Sibel - That Is Where I’ll Go](https://youtu.be/Gi_9-1smxto)

Heroes was an earworm, but very outdated and schlager just wasn’t in it 2008 anymore. We really struggled a lot in the 2000s because of blockvoting. This song had way more mass appeal and it was a year with a lot of poppy songs, so I’m sure this one would’ve stood out.

•2009
[Sara Dawn Finer - Moving On](https://youtu.be/6uhezzqJsKY)

Oh boy, this is the year I’m the most disappointed about during all the years I’ve watched Eurovision. I can think of at least 3 songs that should’ve won instead of this one. Scratch that, ANY song competing in Melfest that year should’ve won over La Voix.

•2010
[Timoteij - Kom](https://youtu.be/ASRry6HQ54w)

I was honestly fine with Anna winning this year, even though I sorta couldn’t get behind her song and had a very bad feeling about the overall package of the entry. Timoteij had a lot more unique song with a bit folk-inspired style that we hadn’t sent before."

My memories are very brief, but my father was in Teritorijalna odbrana Bosne i Hercegovine (Bosnian army) and the shit he had to witness were among the most vile things. Whenever he visits his hometown, he can still remember the smell, how things looked and what he felt exactly. Seeing classmates disappearing one after one. Everyone there knows someone that died. There’s still warning signs up about land mines. He doesn’t like talking about it that much. We crosswd numerous borders until we finally ended up in Sweden. Crazy to think about. I remember one of the men fleeing with us said that if Serbs pulled us over, they would more than likely kill us first and then rape my Mom in front of my Dad before shooting both of them just to drag out the suffering. Also recall my grandfather was in Srebrenica at the time and a family friend that was with him told us afterhand that he had been hiding under a tree when they threw a grenade at him.

europe,fpp3r5a,t1_fpoeqqi,1588795442.0,"> But our healthcare system is not very good at handling mental illness. You get help if you ask for it, but I feel like any kind of ""follow-up"" to it is not taken nearly as seriously as normal sickness. At least considering a lot of mental illness might make you not as able to seek help on your own as a healthy person.

As someone living here and struggling with mental health issues, it took me nearly 5 months to see a psychiatrist. The hoops I had to go through by being put on different antidepressants with awful side effects despite the fact that I had a history at BUP (Swedish Children and Youth Centre for Psychiatric Treatment) from the age of 13 that showed that antidepressants didn’t work. My previous history of self-harm behaviour and suicide attempts wasn’t enough to send me to a psychiatrist directly. It wasn’t until I suffered a full-blown manic episode (as a result of antidepressants, which shouldn’t be handed to people with Bipolar Disorder without some type of mood stabilizer - if even then) and ended up hospitalized that they tried to get a quicker appointment for me. Yeah, in short, the system is messed up and it presumes that you have depression/anxiety, even if you have had diagnostic interviews years before, which is incredibly dangerous."

eurovision,fk44c1h,t3_fgeefs,1583853031.0,"Personally, I have a way bigger issue with massive corporations exploiting events such as Pride to make a quick buck rather than some country sending a singer who just happens to shout out the community in a song. Yes, it’s a tad bit cringe, but it does no harm and in no way profits off of it nearly as much as these. What’s more disgusting to me is companies all of a sudden targetting a vulnerable group of people to market their products when they’ve made homophobic remarks in the past or denied LGBT people service."

AskWomen,fk23jzy,t1_fk1tahf,1583792398.0,"Fellow Bipolar 1 here, initially thought I was just depressed when I was 10-13 following 3 suicides among my relatives and started taking antidepressants which ultimately lead to my first ever full-blown manic episode with psychotic features. Treatment lessened the symptoms of my depressive episode, but I didn’t even realize I was manic until I was hospitalized for nearly jumping off a 5 story building. That was the day I started going off antidepressants. I was hearing constant voices and I still hear them occasionally, but far less often than I used to."

As someone that’s devoted a lot of time to art and music, it’s one of our biggest pet peeves. When it comes to art, there will always be someone before you and after you. ”*Good artists copy, great artists steal*”."
eurovision,fk0luak,t3_fftyqv,1583760562.0,"As a Billie stan, I’m kinda tired of the comparisons to her, but in general it’s really annoying how indie singers are put in the same box. When she started gaining popularity, she was compared to the likes of Melanie Martinez and Halsey too. Eleni and Beyoncé or Duncan and Sam Smith/James Arthur. Every single dude with a guitar is automatically Ed Sheeran or Shawn Mendez like jeez. It’s okay for musicians to be inspired by other’s cause almost everything’s been done before."
