birthcontrol,fkft3iy,t1_fkfsrv2,1584141890.0,This makes me more happy. I am in the US. So I guess I can start planning for this as soon as I get my insurance switched over.
birthcontrol,fkfs51f,t1_fkfbttb,1584141245.0,"I love this. I am definitely going to show him this. Like I replied in another comment, him refusing at the moment gives me time to find a good gyno and save up for the surgery and time off I'll need to take at my new job."
birthcontrol,fkfry2w,t1_fkfmj8y,1584141115.0,"That's kinda my thought. He's not a gyno and I go to a small family practice in a very small town. This way I can save for the procedure with an actual gyno and someone willing to actually just do it when I ask. But again, it's not pressing and it's unlikely that the sex will pick up (unfortunately) again anytime soon.

I'm sorry you may not be able to go traveling, this pandemic thing is really shitty."
birthcontrol,fkex1yt,t1_fkew011,1584122463.0,"This is very true. I do trust him though, he just says he wants me to consider it for longer.

 Another reason I didn't mention for the waiting is that I just got a new job where I'll be 1 of 4 people running an eye care clinic in a very small town. I need to get past my probationary period and certified before I can start saving for a surgery and time off from work. 

So I'm okay with waiting as long as the risk is getting mitigated with the vasectomy. We are also currently not sexually active at the moment and all last year due to current ongoing health conditions, so it's not exactly pressing."
birthcontrol,fkevt7q,t3_fi226e,1584121726.0,That looks abnormal and I would definitely go to the doc or urgent care immediately before it gets worse! Go to the doctors!
birthcontrol,fkeuwby,t3_fi2hyb,1584121185.0,"That's awesome and I want to get it done as well. 28f, no kids and bipolar/depression/anxiety. I'm only okay on my meds and I'm so worried about having to get off of them to have a baby. I'd much rather foster and adopt so they get a mostly sane parent. 

Gonna do the vasectomy route first for my fiance, he has genetic disorders he's likely to pass on so doctor was actually all for that (he was not okay with me going first, the jackass). I'm gonna wait at least 2 more years and then demand it."
bipolar,fj8ykmm,t3_fc50mv,1583125941.0,"Me two months ago. I felt so freaking stupid afterwards. And I didn't want to go to the ER at all. Spent the next 7 hours feeling shitty and in the pysch room, with no dinner. It wasn't even a good drug to OD on. It just made me feel super shitty."

It was also my first purchase like this but omg I do not regret it. If you read some of the reviews, there's a ton of positive feedback for it. It really blew my mind. Also clean up is really easy since it's water proof and super soft silky silicone and easy to charge. I 100% recommend."

BipolarReddit,feq7hoi,t3_eqdiyf,1579338571.0,Wow this is awesome. I wish I did productive things while manic. I just cook a lot and spend all my time being anxious and irritated and making bad decisions. Try to keep strong and keep the job for however long you want it! I wish you the best of luck!

My SO has been in and out of the hospital and back and forth from a dialysis clinic an hour away for 4 months and just now our power shut off. We had enough to get it back on but he's now on a home dialysis machine so we can't have power issues. We're behind on everything.

AskReddit,fbonony,t1_fblw8dm,1577012535.0,I get breakouts of fungal acne depending on product ingredients. The best way I find compatible products is through a site called skincarisma and it has a product checker that specifically tells you if that product is fungal acne safe etc. It's saved me a lot of money through not having to buy and try things without knowing if they'll work. So many cheaper and high end products contain things that'll feed it.
BipolarReddit,fb3w4fl,t3_eb4wox,1576492446.0,"Using products in pumps, taking my time and listening to my bluetooth speaker help me a lot. I also am keeping my hair shorter so less shampoo and less drying time, along with hair wraps like the turbie twist (amazon or ulta, sometimes even at marshalls) so i can let my wet hair dry while i lounge around for hours after. Never get dressed really, just blankets and knowing im clean is nice. ive been able to do every other day for the most part if not everyday. Still hard and still sucks."
