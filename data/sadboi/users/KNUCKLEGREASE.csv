dogs,fqkkhd8,t3_gj6rwc,1589429333.0,"People who need specific bred service animals are the only people who should be allowed to buy from breeders. The rest of the sales are pure vanity.

And the dogs are the ones who suffer.

I cringe when I hear people talk about ""ethical breeders"" when the concept is farcical. There are people who call themselves ""ethical"" when they are literally helping to support an industry that produces genetic miscreants who suffer horribly short lives and who are put down without ever feeling the love of a human being.

""Ethical breeders"" actually *help keep Unethical breeders in business*, by charging high prices that the unethical breeders undercut! 

You know who the first ""ethical breeders"" were? SLAVE OWNERS.

You can say you treat your slaves better than any other master but they are STILL SLAVES.

You can say you breed dogs ethically but  you are PART OF an industry that knowingly inflicts harm on innocent creatures. 

Shame on you all. And shame on the people who give you money to perpetuate this barbarism."

They are an intractable enemy who will rip their own throats out before uttering words of agreement, and they would rip our throats out if they thought they could get away with it.

Better to just win, and win big, and leave them all to destroy one another when their hatred turns inward.

They jumped off the cliff sometime between Bush 1 and Bush 2. I say let gravity do it's damn job."

politics,fqgczxp,t1_fqfr3ud,1589343180.0,"I know several very intelligent, highly educated people who are trump supporters. They do it because they hate black people more than they hate his incompetence.  They hate reporters more than they hate the fact that his policies have killed more than 80,000 Americans. They hate liberals more than the fact that they have lost their jobs or their health insurance.

And they hate themselves more than they hate all of those other things, and trump justifies and vindicates their feelings with his action. This has nothing to do with education. It has everything to do with hate."
