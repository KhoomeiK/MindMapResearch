Two days ago I had the absolute craziest mood swing I had in my entire life. Today I can’t drink coffee, I physically can’t it makes me want to throw up. Mentally I still want it, but I made my cup and two sips in I felt terrible. Online I’ve been reading it can be an early symptom but is it really? Am I going crazy and need to be talked down?

When we tip we’re taking someone’s livelihood into our hands. We have this crazy concept that if someone upsets us we can do whatever we want because we’re entitled to some form of retribution. A MINIMUM tip is supposed to be 10% of your bill, that’s less than 2 dollars more than the $.56 you gave. 20% would have been around $4. If you feel entitled enough to not tip the respectable minimum to someone who (even though the upset you) at the very least did the minimum their job required, and don’t want to confront the waitress or talk to management, you shouldn’t go out to eat. By not tipping as much as a decent person should you’re effecting her job anyways."

We didn’t talk about what it was and I didn’t much care, when we got our wedding bands the clerk told us we needed to get a different engagement ring because mine was cheap. My husband was mortified and hurt by the comments. He was in a rough spot when we got engaged he spend his last $70 on the ring and just went without because it was the perfect one to him and he didn’t want to lose it. I mainly just wear my wedding band to prevent any damage to the other ring. I love that ring with all my heart, he looked at it and decided that it was the one he wanted to get down on one knee with. Most likely he’s acting the way he is because of how he felt picking that ring and in a way you’re negating those feelings. 

TLDR: a lot of emotion goes into picking the ring they pick, respect those emotions. If you’re really concerned just wear the wedding band you choose after you’re married. NAH"
