The first installment (The Longest Journey) came out in the late 90s but it is a classic point-and-click and still holds up. The sequel (Dreamfall) came out around 2007 and the final installment (Dreamfall: Chapters, which most closely resembles LiS because of the choice/consequence structure) came out in 2014.

I actually have some diary entries from late childhood where I talk about how much I hated a neighborhood boy for looking at me with lusty eyes, but I can tell it also made me feel powerful that he wanted me. In my 20s, I wanted to lure men in sexually (e.g., in bars), but then be openly disgusted with their attention. 

Now in my 30s, I have gained weight after re-triggering my CSA and so I dress baggy in the hopes that no one will even glance at me sexually, but at the same time I hate myself for not being sexually alluring like I used to be. Damned if you do and damned if you don‚Äôt!"

I honestly fear that I may never be able to fully function again much less hold down a law practice. And yet people with worse backgrounds than me manage to have families and jobs.

LifeisStrange2,fjb2juf,t3_fcfqnk,1583185237.0,Welcome from Texas!! I just joined Reddit last week so I‚Äôm a newbie too
AskReddit,fj6vgmb,t3_f87myj,1583081033.0,"Hah. I had a traumatic, albeit financially privileged, childhood (ACE score = 4) so I‚Äôve almost always longed for reprieve from life. I am 31 now and had to abandon my corporate law practice in October after several unsuccessful rehab stints over the past few years. I am now on long-term disability leave for PTSD, dysthymia, sleep disorders, etc. I am no longer actively suicidal thanks to the meds, but I still sometimes dream of a car wreck or terminal illness to take me away.

I am not able to feel love like most people, so I don‚Äôt have any sense of guilt of what my death would do to my family and friends. I stay alive mainly because I don‚Äôt currently have the motivation to execute a suicide, but also because there are not many people awake to the suffering in the world, and we need as many soldiers in that battle as possible. Life is most bearable when I am connecting with other trauma victims. Life has purpose when we are holding each other‚Äôs wounds.

As my anger finally awakens and I enter the ‚ÄúGirl with a Dragon Tattoo‚Äù phase of recovery, I also find purpose in planning to finally report the crimes against me and strategizing how to take their enablers down with them (ESPECIALLY the enablers). The sliver of me with that energizing anger wants to f‚Äîing burn the child sexual abuse industrial complex down from the inside. 

TL;DR: Being a rich kid didn‚Äôt exempt me from hating life. I‚Äôm surviving largely thanks to the empathy of my comrades in trauma recovery.

Also, don‚Äôt bother responding with pity. I‚Äôm not lookin‚Äô for it. I‚Äôm luckier than most trauma victims and I know that."

That said, I have been lucky to work with some solid men (I am a female working in corporate/M&A), so the ‚Äúgentlemen‚Äù address never bothered me. Intent is important to me, and I get that for a 65-year-old male partner, it is a habit that may be hard to break. I know they value and respect my work so it is a non-issue in that context. In the OP‚Äôs context, I would‚Äôve been pissed.

Relatedly, is it a faux pas just to address emails to ‚ÄúAll‚Äù? That‚Äôs usually what I do.
