NoStupidQuestions,fov2np7,t3_g9nlna,1588094395.0,"I lived in shared room for at least 5 years. 
The first year I was sharing space with two dudes in a tiny room, in tiny flat shared with another couple. This setting wasn't really working for me, although it saved me a lot of money. 
Next year I moved in to a giant apartment, I am talking 120m¬≤ (about 400ft¬≤) here, with 3 of my very good friends, where two of us shared one room. 
We all were the same age, we had the same interests and most of the time we all hanged out in one room watching tv or just chatting on the couch. 
If you needed silence for studying you could go to the library, or to nearby park. 
As for the sock on the handle thing, we never had any trouble in this direction. If you wanted the room for yourself you picked day/weekend the other roommate was gone to see his family. Or in emergency we had something called ""smooch-room"", originally dining room, which was just big enough to fit single bed in there.
The biggest reason this all was possible, is that I lived with people i personaly knew prior moving together. Cannot imagine sharing teeny-tiny room with completed stranger again."

To be fair, we used to go on Vltava for a few years prior and it suited our needs more. Sazava is not as much of a party river in my opinion.

I am atheist myself, and I have no problem comming to church with my granny from time to time. From what you wrote he never really pushed you to joining his religion or stuff like that. If your roomate happened to be a football player (for example), I believe he would have been talking about football all the time maybe even invite you to his match sometimes. I see this as an equivalent of your roomate wanting you to come and see his church. 
From my point of view you are being rude and ignorant to your roomates interests. Might change your attitude about this if you want to have chill relationship."
