A player tanks 5 sets one day to get his rating down by 550 points. So by that, he gets low on his rating and gets a better shot a winning 5 v 5 set. So here niantic's ELO is at flaw. He for what he knows is just using his time his way. He's not tweaking the game or the phone for advantage.

And if you are talking about ""lower ranked players are getting matched higher ranked players who tanked and this is not fair"". So tell me, don't they have a fair chance to beat them, the ""tanker"" is not using magical pokemons. Yes, it breaks the flow, but you know why, Coz the design of elo rating system is broken.

thermodynamics,fmiqm0z,t3_fmn5lr,1586114925.0,"For your context.

Just take an example of piston and cylinder arrangement.

Heat up the gas, Gas expands moves the piston upwards and the work is done. Now assume a frictionless process. The energy you gave the gas in form of heat is completely converted to work. Now this is a reversible process, But this is not a cyclic process. The gas has expanded and system has not returned into its initial state. To complete the cycle gas needs to be compressed back to its initial state. Hence, some form of work is required there and let us enter the 2nd law.


""Gas given the energy will move up the piston, the molecules will collide and covert their kinetic energy into changing the pistons potential to a fixed point, the point where there will be a balance between gas and piston."" Not from this position, gas will not automatically compress, it will not lose its energy automatically and let piston come down.""

Thats the direction of nature, the arrow of time and the concept of 2nd law. 

Take notice of ""cyclic process"" and ""reversible process""

Reversible cycles are just cycles that can come back to its initial state without gaining entropy. But the gas will need to be compressed and same amount of work needs to be done for it and doing it will result the net work done as zero."

Venusaur on the back hurts my whiscash as well as azumarill.

Alolan raichu, minun can play around really well with there charge moves..alolan raichu mainly beats all of them with thunder punch baiting wishcash

Swampert also gave me hard time coz it easily beats skarmory and wishcash, I had to make correct decisions on my part with putting azumarill right before my opponent launches hydro cannon by counting energy.

If you switch to medicham, skarmory will burn through it. Not sure how you are saying that your medicham will handle skarmory coz I ran simulation and medicham can't beat it on even shields.

If there is a azumarill lead against bastiodon, you can't do anything with medicham and have to switch to toxicroak and play the bait game with mud bomb, if azu stays it will get time and switch before you get time for your 3rd charge move and switch to wishcash (you will have 1 shield) or it can immediately switch to skarmory or wishcash both of which can make you use your shields."
