unpopularopinion,fowlbv9,t3_g9kwsa,1588122034.0,"If someone pretends to have a mental illness, they probably should see a therapist. The argument that they’re “wasting resources” is pointless. People who feel the need to get attention and do so by saying they have a mental illness need help. A therapist can help them manage their insecurities."
