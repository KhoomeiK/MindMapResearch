stopdrinking,fpggina,t1_fpgcoba,1588602246.0,"Yes, good point. It is a problem clearly. It's funny, it sounds like six shots isn't that much especially spread out over a couple hours but going from drinking a few glasses of red wine to shot glasses of whiskey is a big change. Also, body weight, height, how much you've had to eat, how hydrated you are, I guess all that determines how it affects you.

Regardless, I am going to be stepping away from it for a while. I did it for 90 days before, no reason I can't again. And maybe I'll stick with it past then too."
stopdrinking,fpgb6p9,t1_fpgapeb,1588598974.0,"That's true. I guess you don't have to be an alcoholic to want to stop drinking. I just don't want to continue having sleep problems and skin issues and be dehydrated 24/7. There's a reason the term is ""intoxicated"". Alcohol is literally a toxin that we humans seem to be okay with ingesting.

That means there's still a large hole at the entrance however so the Rubbermaid is probably the way to go since you can cut a hole to whatever size you want. Since I live in South Texas, it doesn't get super cold even in winter but I wanted to put them out for cats in case they wanted to use them. They haven't used them however so I don't know if it wasn't cold enough or maybe they're too close to our front and back doors?"

Shit. If I had kids, I wouldn't wanna be around them most of the time. I'd try to think of creative ways to hand them off to others to care for them. Then again, that's really why I don't have any. I... don't want them."

I told her to get them fixed at two months and two pounds of weight and she seemed unsure. She said it was due to money so I had found her low cost events to go to. She was still unsure so I found her some free events to take them to and thought that was the end of it. Yesterday she tells me she needs to go buy a carrier to fix her male kitten (read: cat at this point). I go, I thought you did that like seven months ago?! Also, why just the male? You need to spay the female too! She told me she's not sure it's right to do either of them because it's unnatural and isn't the way nature intended.
