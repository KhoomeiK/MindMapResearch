BPD,flmip85,t3_fpk56x,1585284816.0,I usually carry quite a bit of anxiety about video calls in general. I tend to get a bit stressed before but I think it's winding down the more I do them. We also do EMDR and it seems to be working. Definitely been some experimenting with tools for that :). It's very different but I'm glad I can still process during this time.

I recommend start small. Instead of an hour of walking, try 15-30 minutes and see how it goes. I tend to guilt trip myself if I don't reach these huge ""goals"" that should really be steps toward a goal...

Good Luck and treat yourself with kindness when possible..."

BorderlinePDisorder,fcmqi7y,t3_ehuyeb,1577787215.0,"Been 3 years since one of the worst nights black out drunk. I've been sober since. 

1st year was hard. It was like living in a nightmare and realizing what reality truly was, which included realizing some shit was not all my fault.

2nd year I started working on some self DBT. Was doing better. I was severely stoned all day every day to cope. I played a lot of video games which took my mind off things I couldn't get over.

3rd year, started therapy and DBT officially. My mind is clear. I'm over 6 months sober from weed and my receptors are back. I am always working on my skills and regulation. Things are not perfect but so much better.

I don't drink because I refuse to fall back into that darkness, the nightmare Haze and black outs. I nearly killed myself numerous times; had hospital scares as well. I now care more about my own well being and hope to continue growing into who I want to be. 

Some days, when my emotions are rough, I feel like I might as well just end it one day but it's fleeting. I love being sober. I feel like I can stop a lot of negative things from happening and learn from the past always. I'm still learning as I look back on it all. 

DBT is always there for me. I am always there for me. That's what I continue to tell myself. Good luck. It is not an easy path but it gets more manageable as time goes on and you find more things to enjoy. Mindfully living gets better and more frequent."

BorderlinePDisorder,fckw3p1,t3_ehhrnq,1577734456.0,I quit social media too and it was awesome! Unfortunately...I check what little instagram lets me see of people who don't matter. It's only what is available public and I get shut out very quickly. I still manage to do it every damn day almost. My new years resolution will include stopping that negative spiral. :/

BorderlinePDisorder,f6q6abp,t1_f6q5e51,1573071629.0,Most of all just try to be kindest to yourself through out all of this. It is more than just self-control. Feeling worse about yourself only makes things worse I think. I'm struggling with it too. Best of luck and please take care of yourself as best you can. Even if it's just little steps and stopping one or two negative thoughts...
BorderlinePDisorder,f6q07j2,t3_dsks67,1573068175.0,"Frick, I've been sober for almost three years and my sugar addiction has increased this last year substantially. I lost my older brother two weeks ago and I can't stop eating it. I wake up feeling depressed and ashamed because I know this isn't good. It's trapping. :/ I am mostly just trying to give myself a break because I know that binge eating plus sugar addiction comes from emotional needs and feelings. I keep trying to eat healthy in general but later on in the day I always fuck it up. I wish you luck...I hope it helps that you aren't alone in this bullshit."
BPD,f3fg9ai,t3_dgpzoz,1570896725.0,"1. I became sort of jaded through out the years and my clinginess had really toned down. I also am in therapy and recently finished DBT which helps a lot with the slight clinginess I still have. I am generally more clingy when I need emotional support.
2. I have come to accept that it's not up to me to try to control every risk of being abandoned. If my SO wants to leave or cheat on me, it's on them and I'll be fine. This is a very recent realization. I used to live and die for my SO's in the past. 
3. I feel like I usually do give more and feel more love in general. I am WAY more mindful of my SO's needs and wants. Sometimes it's very upsetting to me but I understand it's the way I am and they don't go that deep. I also have been trying to give them the ""benefit of the doubt"" but it's hard. My brain interprets so fast still. DBT helps. :)"
