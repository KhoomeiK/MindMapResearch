PTSDCombat,f3shosg,t1_f3qlubl,1571103016.0,"Christ. You sound like you’re pretty much in the exact same situation. I’ve not got any further forward and there seem to be no answers. 

I suppose it’s just perseverance at this point, if it’s gonna work, it’ll work."

PTSDCombat,f3a7v97,t1_f3a70ga,1570764004.0,"You may very well be onto something there.. on the odd occasion he appears interested it goes nowhere, he moves away and the subject gets changed... I’m 25 and he’s 33 so I very much doubt that if not being able to is the issue talking about that never mind actually getting something for it would be mortifying. Never mind the fact that it’s a fairly new relationship (a few months) where you wouldn’t expect sex to be an issue generally. 

Unlike him at the moment I have an extremely high sex drive so this is most likely just me being cranky and pent up"
PTSDCombat,f3a5z9n,t1_f3a54u1,1570762565.0,I’m really glad things are moving forward for you! As much as you say “I wish I could guide you better” you did mention one thing I know of that’s likely having a massive impact that I was too busy huffing about my sex life to remember to take into account which was pretty shitty of me. He’s lately been having trouble with his meds which more of less coincides with when the sex life disappeared... so thank you! I know that’s not the definitive reason but I tend to be a lot less stressed about this sort of thing when I can correlate some sort of possible reason beyond “maybe he’s just not interested anymore”
dating_advice,f2w28iz,t3_dedznh,1570460381.0,"My boyfriend was more or less MGTOW when we met but he was friends with one of my mates (most of my mates are guys) so we kept running into each other. We eventually became friends then ended up in a relationship. Sometimes it does happen. Besides, it’s 2019, girls are getting more corward."

My bf rips me to bits for not being house trained. He stays home and cooks and cleans while I’m at work then I bounce in the door like a wrecking ball, make a mess and eat everything before bed."
ptsd,eyt3pq6,t3_cyjto8,1567423557.0,"Yeah, my SO finds them extremely so, even just larger groups, which is why if there’s ever anything that needs done that involves more than a half dozen people he stays home and I go take care of it."
relationship_advice,eysnf1y,t1_eys20ev,1567404723.0,There’s good days and bad days but the bad days are generally getting better aside from the rare really bad one... however on the ones that are excessively bad it seems to be his sleep and stress levels that suffer and between the tiredness and stress he’ll start getting ratty at night. Fortunately those days are easy to spot early on so I tend to know it’s coming. As a whole I’d say improving though.
relationship_advice,eyrxmke,t1_eyrwpkf,1567381224.0,"Oh, that’s been a running thing since I was a kid, it’s not related in any way. I’ve always been the “I’m doing this, like it or lump it” kind of person. My dad used the phrase to describe me when I was wee and everyone I’ve known‘ thought something similar. 

I’ve yet to actually back down on a plan because he’s said something but I have rolled with the over sharing details of what I’m doing to avoid bickering about it. Telling him what I’m doing’s one thing but I’m not into the attempted control... I know that as soon as I indulge it it’ll be expected so as soon as I say I’m doing something now I completely commit to it even if I’m not arsed. 

I just didn’t know what way was best to handle it.."
relationship_advice,eyrs43x,t1_eyr4hty,1567376758.0,"Always wants to know exactly where I am, what I’m up to, who I’m with and why I’m doing it and makes it extremely clear if he doesn’t approve, going as far as trying to guilt trip me out of it if he feels the need. I couldn’t go out and say “I’m nipping into town shopping” I’d have to say “I’m going to Primark with my sister because I need something to wear next weekend”. He does agree that it’s excessive and it is something he says he’s working on with his therapist because it was an issue that was common for him back when he was originally diagnosed. 

It’s the key reason I do definitely agree with the advice to speak to a therapist. I’ve always been excessively independent and stubborn so I’m probably not helping the situation at all."
relationship_advice,eyqebu4,t1_eyqdwo3,1567339720.0,"That’s actually pretty solid advice, thank you so much. It’s not bad by any means and not taking too much of a toll now but it’s starting to take one so wanted advice before it escalated."
dating_advice,eyq9kdh,t3_cy50wz,1567332760.0,"I remember feeling like that too when I was your age. I’m 25 (f) now, I’m not going to tell you you’re too young or anything like that but all these relationships you see now are going to be fleeting and aren’t going to last for all that long. My best friends are guys, the same two that I was best friends with when I wasn’t even a teen yet. There’s been rocky patches when ones had a partner and disappeared but we’ve always ended up back as close friends. I think girlfriends hating you is just part of being a girl friend. I don’t for a minute think you’ll be lonely forever, I used to think that about myself when I was your age, the thought actually terrified me but I’ll tell you this now, you’ll end up like me one day, reading a post like this as your idiot boyfriend/girlfriend/husband/wife/whatever’s obnoxiously snoring next to you and think back to how you worried for nothing."
dating_advice,eyq92wo,t1_eyq8y5a,1567331950.0,"Nah, she said she’d respond if she had time. Leave her be. If she doesn’t she’s not interested. I wouldn’t want anyone just to be my friend because they were angling to ask me out again."
dating_advice,eyq8k7s,t3_cy7uxi,1567331083.0,"No such thing as too broken. My SO has combat PTSD and a whole amalgamation of other issues that make things difficult in many of the ways you’re describing. Hell, it took us 2 years to get from “we like each other” to “we’re dating”. The right person will see past it, however I’d recommend making an effort at self improvement, it’s easier to be patient with someone you can see is trying."
dating_advice,eyq8bxe,t3_cy7gta,1567330709.0,"Now you leave her alone. She said no, that means no. Jesus, persistence is creepy. I’ve never once had a guy persist after I’ve said no and developed an interest because they’d kept at it.
She’s said she’d contact you if she was interested/available for the love of god leave her alone unless she actually does."

ptsd,exs06xq,t3_cu1pe0,1566528600.0,"My boyfriend’s very against it like 90% of the time. He just explained it from the get go. Although to begin with it was just “I don’t like to be touched, it’s not you, it’s a personal thing. Took us years to get from “we like each other” to “we’re together” and for me to understand it to a reasonable extent. He goes through phases of being pretty okay with it and phases of hating it. 

He’s going through a phase of being very against it again just now to the point I slept on the couch the other night because when we were in bed he was jumping at my slightest move. I’m not gonna pretend that it’s easy but I really appreciate actually knowing what it is and that it’s not personal. 

I think it’s actually a big part of why I went onto night shift, it means that most of the time we’re not actually in bed at the same time."
PTSDCombat,ewh91hk,t3_cninwb,1565401207.0,If you’re questioning whether you should seek any sort of help (be it behavioural health or anything else) I’d say it’s probably a good idea to go for it. You can always ditch it if it’s no good for you
ptsd,ewefiid,t3_cnqeg6,1565322522.0,"Just because your trauma sounds smaller than some in the grand scheme doesn’t by any means make it lesser. We all handle things differently, it’s what makes us interesting. 

The feeling of your suffering not being bad enough to justify the diagnosis is a very common thing. But much like thinking the grass is always greener, thinking others have it worse changes nothing about the reality of it as you feel it. 

Weird totally unrelated story to sum it up. My mum and I broke our ankles a couple of months apart. My mum has 3 kids, has had a heart attack twice and broke umpteen bones... she got up, hobbled to the car, drove to the hospital and ended up with a silly boot thing to keep it steady and was back at work the next day. I on the other hand... well the worst thing I’d done so far was break a toe. So I was a sobbing mess, couldn’t put my foot down, had a cast, crutches and off work for 6 weeks. They were still both broken ankles."
PTSDCombat,ewedv97,t3_clc7fk,1565321169.0,"Although it’s never called for I think you need to have a good think for yourself about why he’s done it as no one but you has the answers about what’s best for you. Was it done in anger? Or has it been a panic reaction? 

My partner’s hit me a few times (months and sometimes years apart) in the time I’ve known him  but it’s been when I’ve walked up behind him when he’s been doing something and I’ve startled him. I think everyone at some points hit someone when they’ve been given a fright. We’ve been at each others throats and he’s never once raised a hand. I’ve had the odd hit in my sleep too. 

I think “why” is important."
