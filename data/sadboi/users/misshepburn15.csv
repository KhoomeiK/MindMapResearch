With true depression, you don’t want to do *anything*, including the fun things. 

Sounds like he’s just being a teenager and doesn’t want to clean. Don’t let him fool you. Chores or bye-bye game console/band practice.

Edit: maybe you know this, but I feel I should say it anyways: never use not seeing the girlfriend as punishment, as it also punishes her. I would suggest, if he doesn’t do what he should, limiting that visitation to only having her come over to your house. Don’t let them go out or go to her place.

Edit 2: I am not saying he isn’t feeling sadness/loneliness/unhappiness. I’m simply stating that depression is not selective."

3 months of sleeping. Mother had to wake me to drink meal shakes, as I would not and could not eat proper food. Lost a ton of weight. Showering? Forget it. I could not stand up for more than one minute before I started to cry in pain and for desire to sleep. I felt like a cranky toddler 24/7 - but worse. Simple things like watching tv or playing games was also out of the question. Sleep, sleep, sleep. I fell in love with my bed. 

 It took me nearly three years to feel somewhat normal again, both physically and mentally. I was too busy sleeping at the time to notice, but the illness sent me into a terrible depression. Getting back into a routine was a nightmare, and since I was in high school at the time, going back was extremely difficult. When you have disappeared for months, there comes a lot of questions from peers. And when you feel the way I did, you definitely don’t want the attention.

There was nothing that helped, only time and sleep healed.
