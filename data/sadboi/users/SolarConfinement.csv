They typically have 1-2 br apartments available within your budget, are extremely pet friendly, typically include most if not all utilities (and internet), have great maintenance, and are really nice to work with.

There's high demand for their listings though. So I'd recommend keeping a close eye on their page. June is a good time to be moving since most students are out for the summer."

Like clock work people ask why we close early this particular day and yet they have the audacity to get angry over it. 

""WHEN DO YOU CLOSE"" 

""We're open Y - Z today.""

""WHY?"" 

""Because those are our hours."" 

""WHAT DO YOU MEAN"" 

I've been accused of ruining weekends, false advertising, had discounts demanded, and just general stupidity. Like I'm sorry the education system has failed you but it's not my fault you fail to plan, research, or comprehend the numbers on the door."

Basically from my understanding it comes down to our brains being extremely accustomed to seeing the window patterns in specific circumstances and expecting them to behave in certain ways."

Roughly six years ago she lived in San Diego. She had gotten off of work and was driving home to her parents house. She pulled up in their drive way, turned off the vehicle, and started to open the car door. A masked man sprints up to her and immediately shoves a handgun in her face and demands her purse, wallet, and keys. Apparently she didn't give them to him quick enough so he shot her in the upper thigh. He scurried off immediately and she was rushed to the hospital. Ended up being okay but she was told the bullet narrowly missed her femoral artery. She had a massive scar where the wound was and awful PTSD when going anywhere alone."
