For example, her father died when she was 4 years old. For YEARS I was never told of him, I believed my step-grandfather was my grandpa. When I found out about my biological grandpa, I was told he died in a construction accident. Even that wasn’t true. He died on a camping trip with his family. There’s no hope for her."

raisedbynarcissists,ff2f7t4,t1_ff2e3sb,1579503624.0,"I don’t know why I even care honestly. I’ve gotten to the point where I usually don’t but like I said in my post losing my cat has me really messed up. That cat showed me more love and kindness than my mother ever did. It’s like I’m concerned about hurting someone’s feelings who is literally incapable of having empathy. And I know that’s absurd. 

You’re right though. Ever since she moved, it’s like the childish mentality where if she can’t see me I’m not “really” there. It’s bizarre but I’m thankful for the space that has allowed me to go VERY low contact. If it weren’t for my sister, I’d have told her to get lost a long time ago. 

She knows I’m down right now which is why she is pestering me. Like an alligator trying to pick off the slowest deer in the flock. That is my mother. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. It means a lot to me that someone can validate my feelings and that it’s not all in my head as my mother would try to make you believe lol"

Just this Tuesday I lost my cat to a blood clot in his brain. It is the most horrible pain I've ever known.

The kind of person who does this has never known and will never know genuine love, like you and I have for our cats, because they themselves are unlovable. Ignore this miserable human being and the poison they spread. They have to live the rest of their life being them. They're already getting theirs in that alone.

Take comfort in knowing that you are far from alone and that your beloved cat is with you, always. 

May we both one day find peace <3"

My depression was at bay for quite awhile and I almost forgot how dark the world could be. 

I think the cause, at least for me, was being abused around age 5. Add my genetic predisposition to depression and being raised by a toxic, narcissistic mother and I was doomed to have depression."

That’s what hurts the most right now. He wasn’t old, wasn’t sick and I was, and am, completely blindsided and unprepared for this emotionally and all I want is to go pet him or pick him up or meow at him and he’ll meow back (he was VERY chatty) and it’s like I keep forgetting he’s not here anymore.
