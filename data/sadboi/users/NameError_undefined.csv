This happened to me this past week. I stopped taking my meds (accidentally—it was Pristiq 75mg) and I found myself being fine at work and full of social energy until after work I went for a few drinks and I felt an intense emptiness... like a lowest of the lows type of emptiness. And long story short, I tried to jump off a 41-story building.  Needless to say, I will be starting intensive outpatient therapy ASAP. And yes, do take your meds."

Everyone at some level of distance because I’m so afraid of being abandoned."
BPD,fh26csc,t3_f100id,1581237294.0,"Yes. All the time. I always thought this was because I was an immigrant but after talking to many folks who are also immigrants I realized it’s a much stronger feeling than feeling like an outsider. I feel perpetually restless and uneasy especially around family or people I’m supposedly close to because that structure triggers a profound emptiness inside
because I feel the added pressure of, “well, these are the people I ought to feel safe with.”"
