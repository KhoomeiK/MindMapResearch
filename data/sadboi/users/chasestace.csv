TrueOffMyChest,f4t1n7v,t3_dlmor8,1571783049.0,"I have a different approach to this. I am myself overweight and have struggled with this my whole life. I can go into the why’s and what for’s...but it stems from abuse which turned into unhealthy coping mechanisms. But I do not go out of my way to exploit or stereotype myself. When I was truly in an ankle cast I REFUSED to ride the motorized scooter at the store because I was embarrassed about being fat. Truthfully the majority of people on those scooters are obese. Morbidly so. 

My now dead husband ate himself into a disability as OP stated. I was mortified to go to the store with him on that damn scooter. All of his health problems stemmed from his weight and he never got proactive to make a change. He submitted to the pain and got lazier and lazier until he was wheelchair and bed bound. Wheelchairs for big people are expensive and DO NOT fit through doorways. He died of weight related problems at a young age.

Now, back to me, I do not have high blood pressure, cholesterol or blood sugar. I walk as much as possible and do not buy copious amounts of junk food or fast food. I stay away from buffet restaurants at all costs (because of the stereotype). When walking through a parking garage, a shuttle service will stop and ask if I want to ride, I say no thanks and keep moving.

I’m not happy. Us fatty’s are not happy. And I personally do not support this body positivity movement. I don’t want to see Ashley Graham or Lizzo feeling their full figured selves. Yes, they’re gorgeous. But I still want to see a Beyoncé type women. Something to aspire to because this body won’t have me embracing it as beautiful enough to be put on display."

He responded by inviting me and my son (his first grandchild) to Christmas.
It was a good time but it was a little tense and we skirted around the issues.
He and I are both passive aggressive and don’t like confrontation.
I’m 45 now and our relationship is still strained. He cries every time we say goodbye. I’m over it but he’s obviously not. I’ve had a good life without him in it constantly.

Work on yourself now. Find your happiness apart from having a gf.
It will get better. Live your life and don’t dwell on what she is or isn’t doing. This is YOUR moment!!"
TrueOffMyChest,f1mrm1c,t3_d9vhx1,1569600603.0,"True to your situation. Being consistently broke and living at poverty level sucks. I used to be there.

Money can make a whole world of difference.

My situation where I finally said money can’t buy happiness is: I was literally working myself to death. I went from living paycheck to paycheck and struggling bc you get paid on Friday after you pay the bills and get groceries you’re literally broke by Monday and you worry how the hell you’re going to stay afloat for the next week and a half. Kids will always need something, no wiggle room for an emergency.

But I got a fantastic promotion and the money was great. Moved to a bigger better place and was thriving. Kids wanted for nothing. But after literally 7 years of having ONE vacation and ZERO personal life because I worked 6 days a week and was on call 24/7 365. I said enough! The money wasn’t worth being more committed to my job than my LIFE. 

I’m back to the struggle but I don’t mind it. My mental health is in tact now."

You can’t believe what a bunch of stupid strangers have to say. The same way I personally love TOASTING people, there are also evil asshats who live for roasting people. They have nothing better in their lives and are projecting on you.

Now you look decent and kind. You are very nice looking. But that’s surface compliments. Those losers don’t know the true you.

Chin up! You’re far more than the worst roast you received. You are kind and considerate and the world is yours to conquer! Follow your dreams!!!! Don’t give up!!!"
