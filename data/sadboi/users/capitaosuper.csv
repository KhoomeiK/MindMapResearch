People are like this and want to save lifes because they know how is like to be in your position and how hard it is. It's so normal to have suicidal thoughts tho we all care about the cause and are concerned about what depression can turn society into. We all care about you because we share this thing in common. You are part of something big and you can actually make a difference or try to. Everyone knows it's hard. But we are in this boat together, and I know there is a part of you, even if it's Hiden under all the depressed thoughts, that wants to live life and experiment new things and help people just like I'm trying to do and believe me, I'm trying my best. Try to think about what is causing those thoughts and how you can face them and improve your situation. Peace and love"

Instead of thinking about actually kill yourself, think about it like it's a casual thought. After that, think about why you are feeling like that. Cry if you need to, get crazy, destroy something, you are human and humans are impulsive. After all of this, remember why you are feeling like this and then seek for help and how to improve your life.
