AskAnAmerican,fj7brkc,t1_fj767xq,1583089346.0,"I second the weirdness of this. While there definitely was racism in the south, and i don't want to discount how harmful and disgusting it is to still be flying a confederate flag, even the yee-yee boys who flew them didn't like advocate for slavery or racism. They always said the two things were separate like they really believed it. 

That's not to say that there aren't people who still feel that way, but if you asked me to estimate if the percentage of people who were racist were higher on reddit or in my bumfuck southern farming town, I would say there's a \*way\* higher percentage on reddit."
AskAnAmerican,fj7amqq,t3_fby03d,1583088906.0,"Hey there! I was born and raised in the South and my parents are from the North, so I figured I’d try to answer your question. All regional culture in America is different, but Southerners seem to be the easiest to make fun of. Here are some jokes poked at southerners and why I think they are made

1.) Double talk

It’s a common stereotype that in the south, you will \*sometimes\* hear people say “bless their heart” with the connotation that the speaker doesn’t care or have any sympathy for the person they’re speaking about. This is likely because, while ‘bless your heart’ seems like a sweet phrase, it can be used sarcastically. Like when someone does something dumb and someone else says “at least you’re pretty”. Southern sarcasm does sound a bit different from other regions’ sarcasm, at least in my experience could be a bit harder to identify if you’re not used to it.

2.) Racism/Homophobia/General Bigotry

A large portion of the south is in what we call ‘the bible belt’. Basically, a very religious section of the country. Due to this, most people from the south are \*very divided\* on queer rights. Some people are all for them, and some people are very against them, with not a lot of people being ambivalent, as it can be in other regions.

Jokes about the South being racist are easy to make. The KKK was founded an hour’s drive south of my hometown. Slavery was predominantly in the South until the Emancipation Proclamation.

3.) Southerners are stupid

Like the others, this is rooted in real occurrences, but not as prevalent as it’s made to seem. The economy in the south can be largely dependent on farming, factory work, or mining depending on where you go. Some towns have high rates of graduation, others don’t. It’s often considered respectable in the south to go into manual labor.

4.) Inbreeding

It’s a common joke for people outside the Southern states to say that we are all inbred. In the Southern states, we say everyone in Alabama is inbred. I don’t know how this came to be, nor do I have an analysis on it, but I think it’s fucking hilarious.

It’s not to go without mentioning that Southerners make fun of other regions. They say things like ‘People from the Midwest are so nice’ or ‘People from the North are unhappy’ or ‘People from out West are unrealistic’. I will say though, even before Trump or Obama took office, political division humor was always more popular in the south than regional division humor."
