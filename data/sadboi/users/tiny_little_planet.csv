My point is that life is too short to let this get in the way. There are things out there that you can do to help make life enjoyable again. There are a couple steps you need to take first. Be honest with your parents about your feelings. Try a psychiatrist. He/she may offer a prescription. It helped me. It could very well help you.

When you have anxiety your body tends to feel EVERYTHING that you otherwise wouldn't feel if you weren't sensitive to it.

I am not on meds now (I was pregnant so had to get off them) but I know I need them again because it was a huge help. All the pains went away. Sometimes I would have a mild panic attack, but I could fight it off easily and it was rare. I had more energy. The meds were a right fit for me.

Either way get familiar with the pains. It took me a very long time, but I learned to live with them. They don't bother me and are much less debilitating when you can laugh to yourself about it.

My meds helped a lot, but I am off them now and need to get back on them asap. 

The anxiety pains are the body's way of releasing anxiety. If you don't have a way for the anxiety to escape then it will manifest in other ways. This is why some people say to exercise to release anxiety. And it does work. It's not always the final cure, but it's the best thing you can do for yourself without meds.

I was on 30mg Cymbalta for about 6 months until I got pregnant, so I quit. We lost the baby about a month ago. I was going to hold off on anxiety meds again, but now my hormones are going back to the pre-baby era and I feel like I'm losing control again. I am going to find a new doctor to prescribe me what I need (I moved since I stopped taking the meds) because I know I can't do this anymore. 

I have this constant feeling where I feel I need to take a deep breath with every breath, but I can't. I'm not struggling to breathe, but I feel like I need to breath more deeply than I do. This only happens when I'm thinking about it. When I'm not focused on the anxiety I'm usually fine. My reminder to breathe deeply comes every time I feel a weird sensation in my body (happens all the time) or when my brain randomly wants to remind me, ""Hey you! You've got anxiety disorder! Time to lose control!"" I've gotten pretty good at keeping the panic attacks away. But right now it's general anxiety all over again. The weird pains are back. The slight hypochondria (don't really care about Covid-19 though). 

My questions are these. Do you have any recommendations for someone like me to manage this until I can get help? Words of wisdom? Anything that might have helped other people in my situation.

Miscarriage,fhqisiz,t1_fhpetff,1581804929.0,"No problem at all! This will get a bit graphic so keep that in mind. 

My body carried the baby for 3 weeks before we found out at the ultrasound from hell. I was none the wiser that the baby had died. My doctor highly suggested the D&C instead of the pills. I'm guessing because it's a sure thing that they get all the placenta out. Also because my body was not going to do this naturally for a while since it didn't even know after three whole weeks. 

We chose the D&C.

I have never had surgery before nor put to sleep. I was scared beyond belief. The anesthesiologist was very comforting, knowing how frightened I was. The same with the doctors and nurses prepping me and performing the surgery. I don't remember being put to sleep. I woke up 20 minutes after the surgery was done. I felt fine. Sad because everything I was holding onto was now gone. I never did have a final goodbye, but I knew since I had lost the baby long ago that that ship had sailed.

My D&C was 9 days ago. I did not take any prescription pain meds and only took ibuprofen twice. My bleeding was moderate for a couple hours after the surgery, heavy for one hour, and then more moderate/mild until now. Now it's mild bleeding with brown discharge (dried blood?). As for the pain I had some soreness in my vagina for a few days (honestly felt like pain you get from a good, hard night of sex) and some mild cramping that got worse on day 3, but subsided. I did have a couple dizzy spells (keep taking your prenatels!) My surgery was on a Thursday and I took Friday and Monday off of work. 

I forgot to mention this fun part. The nurse had to give me 800mg of Cytotec. This would contract my uterus so I would shrink back down to normal size. The hospital gave me 8 100mg pills. Doesn't sound so bad, yes? Well...these pills had to go up my butt. Why? Because I did something in another life where karma felt this was the right time for payback. The worst part of this experience was the feeling like I had to poop for the next several hours. Quite uncomfortable. 

Ultimately the entire D&C experience was not bad. We plan on trying again and if I have to do this part again, I will. We do have an appointment with the OBGYN this week to see how I am doing and if anything is wrong with me. It is scary waiting, but there is nothing I can do about it. I will say there is a big feeling of relief when the D&C is over. For me it was the first step to moving on. I am still emotional and cry randomly. I'm sure I will be like this for a while. It's grieving. It does not happen in one day. 

Sooth yourself however you can. Even if it's something selfish, like buying a new purse, shoes, or a video game console (that's what we did).

Miscarriage,fhoz15r,t3_f45x34,1581778312.0,"I feel the exact same way. We lost our first baby last week. I'm scared to try again, but I want a family. I know I won't be excited because I will just worry all the time. It was an mmc and it could happen the same way again where we find out at the doctor. People keep telling me they've had multiple miscarriages before they were able to have a baby. Can my body handle that?! 

 I just wanted you to know you aren't alone in your feelings. This just fucking sucks. But if you and your husband support each other through each moment, you both will make it though this."

Miscarriage,fhfxnx4,t1_fhfx78t,1581553762.0,"I'm so sorry! To have to explain to a child must be heartbreaking. I have none and this was my first pregnancy. I'm crossing my fingers I will be okay next time (I'm 34). I hope you and your husband (or wife or partner, I'm cool with all) are doing well otherwise. It's easier when you have a support system. My husband has been wonderful."
Miscarriage,fhfx42b,t1_fhfwagg,1581553380.0,"I'm sorry you cannot take off work. My boss had to pick up some slack from me while I was gone. Now I'm playing catch-up. But don't feel like you can't even miss a day because you'll feel bad for your tram. Things happen and you need to help you right now. IF you really cannot take off work then make sure you take time for yourself when you are home. 

I was too scared to miscarry naturally because then I would have to face it. And then what? Flush it? Throw it away? The doctor told me to get a D&C, but I would have been too chicken shit to do it naturally anyway. 

You are brave. No matter what keep that in mind."
Miscarriage,fhfw039,t3_f2j48r,1581552616.0,"Oddly enough I also have a friend due two days after I was due. Also in August. I found out just last week that I lost my baby and I can't imagine feeling better at the moment. Life is happening around me, not to me. 

You take all the time you need heal. You aren't mad that your friend's are pregnant. You are happy for them and you would show it if you weren't having such a hard time. Don't be hard on yourself for not involving yourself more in their lives right now. If they are friends they will understand what you are going through and give you space and support. I know I would do the same for my friends if that were me."
Miscarriage,fhfvgnb,t3_f2oahf,1581552252.0,"I don't know how to deal either. You just do. Time will pass whether you want it or not. 

I found out last week that I lost my baby. This whole situation sucks. It should never happened to those who want to be parents. Who deserve to be parents. What cruel joke is this to play on us?!

Can you not take off work because they won't let you. Or because they won't pay you? I ask because this is something I feel that you need. I only took a couple days off and I wish I had more time. Physically I am okay. Emotionally I am not. We don't deserve this."
Miscarriage,fhfuwz3,t3_f2r3tt,1581551879.0,"I went to my appointment last Tuesday. I was supposed to be 14 weeks and I found out I had lost the baby 3 weeks prior. I had a D&C to remove the baby two days later because my body held on for so long. It had no idea. I had no idea. For 3 weeks I was talking to a dead baby inside me. I feel betrayed. Stupid. Icky. Like a monster. I don't feel human anymore. 

For now please take all the time you need to heal. Grieve. Cry. Scream. Let it all out. It's what I do. It's the only thing that helps me right now."
Miscarriage,fh6vquh,t1_fh6ta1m,1581307332.0,"I read more about it online and it seems like a lot of women have dizzy spells due to lack of iron and hormonal changes. I had to talk myself down from a full on panic attack. I'm much better now, but this isn't fun stuff. 

Can't wait to speak to my doctor tomorrow."
Miscarriage,fh3g8nl,t3_f0bwwg,1581268681.0,"I had my D&C on Thursday. I had some moderate cramping last night and it freaked me out. Until then I've had little to no cramping. This is my first MC and D&C. No other symptoms of anything going wrong as well. It's weird. I'm guessing it's my uterus shrinking down, but I will speak to my doctor tomorrow. Hopefully I will have news for you, but just so you know you are not alone."
Miscarriage,fh3ej3y,t3_f0l5pu,1581268116.0,"I had my first mmc and D&C a few days ago. So far I am happy with the results as well. The pill terrifies me, but so does surgery. Lose lose situation, but ultimately glad that it's all over."
Miscarriage,fh3cidj,t3_f0l9oj,1581267429.0,"No shit you aren't handling it well. I wouldn't be either in your situation. What the hell is wrong with people?! 

1. Your birthday is not an excuse for someone else to relate their happy news. They want to announce a baby then they do it at their time, not yours. If they can't handle it then they aren't invited. 

2. Your coworker is a narcissistic bitch. Get her out of your office/cubicle/personal space. I would tell her to take her issues home where they belong. This is a workplace, not a psychiatrists office.

I'm only a few days in from my post D&C. I don't have all the wisdom for you, but my goodness those people you describe are pissing me off. I would be in an absolute rage. And with you feeling the way that you are, a good solid rage might help you get those feeling out. Get to the peak of a mountain and scream to your heart's content. Let it all out! You can't change those people, but it's not fair to you to keep it locked inside."
Miscarriage,fh3b7gd,t3_f13h4r,1581266980.0,"I am unsure how you tell her, but I can offer my experience from the other side. One of my best friends is pregnant and I just miscarried. We were due around the same time, too (days apart). I also found out another old friend is pregnant and did the whole announcement thing on FB. 

For these two women I am very happy for them. My miscarriage should not affect their happiness. That is not fair to them. Yes, I am going through hell right now. I will be okay, though. I have a great support system and the best husband I could hope for."
Miscarriage,fh39dvl,t3_f0ye9h,1581266371.0,"You are a strong person for choosing the pill. I was too scared and had my D&C a few days ago. 

I have to go back to work tomorrow (can't afford to take time off). For now my husband and I bought a Switch and am passing the time with Zelda. Staying away from anything baby/family related on the tele also helps.  Brittish Baking Show is my go-to right now.

This was also my first baby and first miscarriage."
Miscarriage,fh3861y,t3_f11wuz,1581265970.0,"I, too, feel embarrassed that I told so many people and had to face telling everyone that I spoke too soon. 

My husband's birthday was Thursday, the date of my d&c. Why so these things have to happen around these times? I feel like the worst wife in the world. 

Bottom line, take your time to heal. Whatever you need to do for yourself, just do it. You deserve to be happy."
panicdisorder,fgt0wua,t3_f0bsy0,1581096734.0,"I can tell you right now that there is no quick fix for this, but I need you to be as strong as you can right now. 

I've had panic attacks since I was a child. I have an idea of what you are going through, although, we are all different. And we cope differently. Please know that you are NOT alone. 

Your first step is to start today. Start small. Anything you can do. 5 or 10 minutes at a time. Something that releases your endorphins. Exercise. People say it all the time but it's true. Some push ups, crunches, anything that pushes your body to forget what you are feeling and focus that pain somewhere else. Or maybe try an another activity. Painting. Sewing. Building. Boxing. Learn a skill you've been curious about. Cooking. Dancing. Accordion lessons (it really is a dying art).  

Right now it's probably hard because you feel like doing nothing. Your brain won't get this feeling out of your head. It's taking over. An overwhelming dread that paralyzes your spirit.

STOP FOCUSING ON IT! 

Once that feeling starts to rush over is when you tell it to "" Get The Fuck Out."" You don't have time for this. You have a life to live. You are only 17. So much wonder is waiting for you. You can do anything you want to. Or don't want to. Don't let me tell you what to do, but don't let this anxiety dictate your life. 

To finish my thought I will tell you that I do need meds to help me out. I take 30mg of Cymbalta once a day. Not all meds help people equally, but something may be right for you. Research it and speak to the therapist about it when you see him/her. I still recommend the activities because this is something that needs your attention from every angle. And once you get it under control, you will realize how fun life really is when you take advantage of it.

Don't give up."
Miscarriage,fgrs22o,t1_fgrr6nj,1581055572.0,"Almost exactly my experience EXCEPT I was told it was better for me to be put to sleep (I wanted to just be numbed). Not to worry. I will pay $5/month for the rest of my life to pay off my $2500 deductable. Fuck America's broken health system, but definitely worth a D&C if offered. ""A sense of peace"" is the perfect way to describe it."

How the hell my body didn't notice I've been carrying a tomb instead of a womb is beyond me. No bleeding. No pain. No warning signs at all. I go in tomorrow for a D&E. All I can think about is how I would talk to my baby belly not knowing I've been talking to a dead baby. I feel icky. I feel unnatural. I feel lost. I feel helpless. This world has played a very cruel joke.

I'm terrified of the procedure. What if something goes wrong. What if something is wrong with me. What if I'll never have children.

I am sorry you had to join. I am here with you. We all are."
