Either way, you are not changing their attitude. 

I feel like you are probably smart enough to know my above statement already. So that leaves pretty much one reason for your post: your an INTJ who thinks your special and should get attention for posting common knowledge on the subreddit. 

I mean it’s literally in the phrasing of your post. It’s super hateful for no reason. It screams: ‘I’m better than all you immature assholes who think your better.’

1. You forgot the link lol. Funny. Because you have no proof to back that statement up, and I should add, anyone reporting those numbers is an unreliable news source.

2. u/SlowDevice6 already stated this, but, please do the math before making such a brazen statement because as they pointed out, deaths were 1 in 826.

3. You say that Dr. Fauci says deaths are underreported. Likely true. But are you forgetting how vastly underreported COVID cases across the world are? There’s no way to know because there are literally that many underreported cases. The US was a shitshow initially getting testing together, so imagine how many people in the US alone had mild or asymptomatic cases before testing was available. Even now, I am sure there are plenty of Americans who aren’t going to go get tested."

puppy101,fqz17su,t1_fqz06qy,1589758092.0,"Thanks for the information. Another question: do you know if some reputable breeders will offer varying payment options? I want a dog with proper health testing/temperament testing, etc, but 1200-1500 is a lot to shell out at once. I also definitely do not want to pay upwards of 1200+ for a puppy that is going to tear everything I own to shreds, etc. this obviously is partially on me as the owner because all puppies require the proper training and time. Also, I am not saying breeders should charge crazy low prices, because clearly a lot of work and time goes into producing a healthy line that has been tested properly and the prices are adequate/what I would expect them to be. 

Edit: i just remembered there is usually a deposit before full payment correct? This would probably be doable if the deposit was several weeks before the puppy was available to take home."

I use a period tracking app and try to pay attention to cervical mucus. 

According to my app and mucus and the typical length of my cycle I’m pretty sure I was in my ovulation time frame when we had sex so that’s why I’m so worried, but I do understand that apps obviously aren’t the most accurate to track ovulation. 

I also know generally condoms don’t leak especially if you’ve used proper application and proper use of the reservoir but he went somewhat soft so I’m just scared it could have leaked. It would just be a terrible time in my life to get pregnant so I’m very concerned. I really need to find something more consistent in terms of birth control and I’m fjne with a pill but it’s trial and error finding the right one.

Anxietyhelp,fqmbg1w,t3_gjmh3b,1589474679.0,"If someone loves you, you shouldn’t be told your an inconvenience or be made to feel that that persons mental health is any more valuable than your own. I would recommend seeing a therapist, as others have recommended. I have had anxiety for years which recently transpired into a pretty bad depressive episode. 

Seeing a therapist was a great decision and I’m starting to feel ok again. My friends and family are, thankfully, very supportive of my mental health issues and my decision to seek treatment and they view my condition as real. I know there are many who aren’t so lucky. My point is, even with the support system I have, I still needed to seek help. All that being said, if your friends and family truly make you feel like a burden, or like your issues aren’t valid, once you are feeling better, please try to seek out other friends who will support you in your time of need. 

Our friends and family aren’t our therapists, no, but it’s also literally part of their responsibility in the relationships they have with us to support us through difficult times and hear us out. You should not feel guilty for seeking their help because at least you asked for it in the first place. They just weren’t willing to do so and that’s sad. I know most people commenting are trying to be helpful, but if you are reading this and you are going to leave another comment about how OP shouldn’t put so much on his friends and family and that he is inconveniencing *their* mental health, consider that we don’t know if these people have ever actually truly tried to help OP or if they have always been somewhat dismissive. 

Also, wouldn’t you want your friends and family to give their support, however small their efforts might be, if you were in this situation? OP says that he doesn’t dump his feelings on them for hours at a time and that he simply tries to say he is feeling anxious or that he just needs someone to talk with. There is nothing wrong with that. OP’s family is clearly the problem if all he does is try to ask for help and they turn him down. 

OP, my suggestions are: get a therapist, that is not meant as an insult, therapists are just there specifically to listen to you and be helpful. I’d also recommended getting a pet. My dog has been great for my emotional health, and they are great companions to combat loneliness. Sometimes I literally just cry with my dog on the floor and talk to him. Sounds crazy, but it helps. Be sure to take care of yourself as it goes a long way. Hot showers, meditation, and simple activities such as painting or coloring have been really relaxing to me. Good luck ❤️"

He has been married twice, first wife cheated on him multiple times and they divorced, second wife has bipolar and flipped out and was causing so much stress/tension in the family that he made her pack her things. She still gets visitation obviously and he helps her with her bills from time to time but she was mistreating the kids (he still has a 9 year old who was much younger when this all happened, and it was just dangerous for him to be around her at one point) and so he made her go so that he could raise them in a somewhat stable environment. 

He provides everything for all of his children and as far as I know, doesn’t receive child support from either of his ex wives. Somehow, between working full time and raising four children on his own, he managed to help me with my homework during high school, teach me how to drive, chase off boyfriends that were abusive, and then pay for my wedding dress and walk me down the aisle last year. I will always have a deep appreciation for single fathers because of what he did for me and because I watched him struggle for years raising all his kids by himself.

Seriously, people with the mentality is EXACTLY why this shit still happens. Like, say you get assaulted, press charges, go to court, but the jury is even at the least, half made up of people with this opinion. Yeah, good luck. 
Even grosser is when women themselves literally have this mentality. Everyone just wants to seem holier than thou and some people genuinely don’t give a fuck when things like this happen to other people because they want to place blame on the victim. I will never understand people justifying the actions of literal CRIMINALS who they don’t even know, like wtf."

He loves to wrestle with other dogs at the park and he’ll also run with the toy if I throw it for him, but has zero desire to pick it up and bring it back. If he’s *super* energized that day then he will pounce on it a few times in the grass maybe once or twice and then that’s it and he would rather just walk around the yard and sniff everything. I love our local dog park because it’s huge (literally like 14 acres or something along those lines) has a big pond in the middle of it, and usually fairly empty. He has an absolute blast at that park and it’s only like seven minutes from my house. I feel like they are just very free spirited dogs who can be content in almost every environment as long as they are being fed and petted 😂"

It can really impact you later in life if you are not believed or if your illness is just dismissed as not real or something durable. It can completely disable the child when parents don’t listen to things like that and I’m so sorry that they have brought so much struggle upon you. 

Some days it’s so hard for me to deal with just getting out of the bed in the morning and doing simple tasks like cleaning the house or driving somewhere (I suffer with severe anxiety) and I have a great support system so I genuinely cannot imagine dealing with that all the while people are dismissing my experience.

Moreover, even if they didn’t believe the noise, why on earth would the broken window not cause them to believe their child about the noises? Smh. 

Shitty parenting and irresponsible af because as others have pointed out this should be reported for OPs safety and the neighborhoods safety. It’s so stupid when people have the mentality of “well that can’t be true because bad things can’t happen to me”. That’s exactly how you end up dead or injured or in a bad situation.

He got so many downvotes on most of his comments because he didn’t wanna listen to the advice they were giving him. If it was all for karma and attention, he didn’t really get anywhere with how many people downvoted him lmao. I could honestly see the situation being legitimately real. There are some real psychos out there as we all know, and if OP has been locked in this power struggle with his SO far several years (sounds like he has because of how long they’ve been together) then maybe he really just does not know any better and can’t be pleased in terms of a solution because he’s been gaslighted for years. Just a theory of course. 

Consider: John Wayne Gacy hid literal bodies in his basement for months, with an unrelenting smell coming from the basement. It took his wife months to leave him and even then she didn’t ever go into the basement. Not saying OPs fiancée is a murderer, just pointing out that people can hide some crazy shit from their SO’s if they really want to and the other person isn’t always going to stand up for themselves or take it upon themselves to investigate."

It’s their body either way, but if this woman doesn’t want an abortion, not a single soul should force her into that type of decision. If you don’t want one, it can be an incredibly traumatic experience to be forced into one, just like being forced to have a child is equally as traumatizing. 

Her husband isn’t trying to empower her, he is forcing her into a decision she isn’t ready for as a means to control her because he’s clearly abusive. Educate yourself better."

If you can’t get a lawyer right now, get in contact with family or friends and tell them your leaving and need a place to stay. 

Also, this comment section is nuts. To everyone telling this poor woman that her life is a result of her bad choices, consider: have you ever been in abusive relationship? 
If you have, you know it’s a complicated ordeal. Also consider that you know nothing of this woman’s life and why she might be married to this guy. It could’ve been an arranged marriage, she could have had to turn to someone like this to survive financially, we don’t know the story. And whatever the case, it doesn’t make you incapable of having a little empathy for someone in a bad situation. 

Shame on all of you. Too bad there aren’t classes out there in human fucking decency because I’d sincerely hope you would all take them if so. Spread your hate somewhere else and go see a therapist."

He loves the park but that is the only time I ever see him have energy. And afterwards he will just sleep all day as well. It’s nice to have such a low energy dog sometimes after owning German shepherds in the past, but it makes play time difficult sometimes. What do you give in terms of bones? I need to find him some good ones but I’m leary of most of them because of his size and not wanting him to break them into too small of pieces."

Also, he goes through weird phases where he chews up random items like hangers and such, but when I offer him toys when he gets into those moods he has zero interest 🤣"

unpopularopinion,fq10w6e,t1_fpsvnpk,1589040266.0,"I agree with this comment. I’m not disagreeing with the overall point of OPs post but leash training really does vary depending on breed and size. I have a massive Great Pyrenees, he is incredibly gentle and very sweet but he’s still young and has some pretty intense bursts of energy every so often. Even at four months it was difficult to get him to obey on a leash because of his size and weight. 

Leash training is not always an easy task and owners shouldn’t be shamed/called bad owners for having a dog that pulls... that does not make the dog bad. I just take my boy to our local dog park because he enjoys that so much more than a walk on a leash anyway. He loves to run and have space to do so, so for exercise I typically just let him loose in the yard or take him to a park, like I stated above.

Also, I fucking despise shock collars and anything that brings a dog discomfort or pain to train them. It’s literally just using pain to wire them into listening to you. It’s not good for them and you shouldn’t have a dog if your just gonna use harmful methods to force them into obedience."

I agree because I’m thin and tall, and I have become extremely insecure about my own body because of this movement. Most young guys nowadays only want thick girls. You look all over Instagram, and all the girls with the most followers and the most money/whatever else, have huge boobs and a huge ass. I was graced with neither, and nowadays I rarely see a relatable/beautiful woman who is my size and popular or praised for her body. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve gotten the comments: ‘eat more’ ‘do you ever eat?’ ‘You need some meat on your bones’ ‘drink a protein shake’. I can’t tell you how many hours I spent in the gym weight training so that I could gain 20+ pounds and an ass. 

Etc. and none of these people seem to get that it’s literally just my metabolism and I eat A TON, and just never put on any weight. Body acceptance and body positivity has only ever been about curvy and fat people.

It’s so stupid when I see people come for these brands and shove inclusivity down their throats.

Some of the most renowned pedophiles/predators in the world hid it for years, with no one suspecting a thing. 

Abusers are typically notorious for hiding things so well. This is easily believable in my opinion. Husband hides who he really is for years, wife catches him being shady in the middle of the night, he gets defensive and avoids her all day.
