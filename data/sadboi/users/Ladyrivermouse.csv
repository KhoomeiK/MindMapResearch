ptsd,fcm20d0,t3_ehvw1h,1577762158.0,"For awhile after I was diagnosed I was scared to open up to people about my diagnosis. About two months ago I felt comfortable enough to open up to someone at my church about the diagnosis but not really the details of what happened. Their immediate response was ""oh! I didn't know you were military!"" and I don't blame her or feel angry at her for assuming that. I feel like there is a large amount of people that immediately think of military service when it comes to ptsd because that's what society has told us ptsd is. Both of us saw it as a learning opportunity to encourage others with ptsd to talk about what they're going through and to encourage those who don't to keep an open mind  and learn how to approach and talk to someone struggling with ptsd.
It has happened to me a few times since then. Some people were pretty open to learning and some people kinda of shut me down and made me feel invalid or demanded to know what caused my ptsd, but that's okay. At least they heard the truth that ptsd can be caused by any trauma, not just military."

ptsd,fcfrujj,t3_eh4we7,1577633160.0,"I have a very similar problem after flashbacks of some of my more severe traumas. It's like my brain just has a shut off switch when it gets too overwhelmed. Usually when I get to that point I will either dissociate and let my brain go into autopilot or I'm still kind of there and I can do most things but I can't really talk much at all. Sometimes it takes me a few days or sometimes weeks to ground myself again and be able to take back control.

I live with my boyfriend and he says that sometimes when this happens the best thing he knows to do that helps is try and keep me engaged in what's happening at the present moment. Sometimes he'll ask me questions about what's around me, what I can see, feel, hear, touch, or smell. Even if I can't answer him I'm still registering the answers in my brain. He won't let me break my routine either. If there's a specific thing I do at the same time everyday he makes sure I get it done. Sometimes it takes a long time to do it, but it gets done. Most importantly he makes me laugh. I'm not sure why this works, but if he can make me laugh when I'm shut down it sparks that part of my brain to try and pull me out of it.

There are a lot of resources for your friend, I would highly recommend looking into them. I know there's some like my therapist, psychiatrist, and the crisis text line that I wouldn't have survived with out. It's truly amazing that you want to be there for your friend and help him through this. Just remember, you can't do it on your own. You have to make sure he's getting the right help from professionals too."

ptsd,fc8zup0,t3_egndli,1577544762.0,"I posted about this a few weeks ago! I wasn't sure if it was something physically wrong with me or if it was a part of my ptsd. A lot of people also said that they had similar issues when they were triggered. I do kinda the same thing we're my entire head will tilt or shake violently but I also have a tick in my hands that are a little more subtle. I was advices iny post that it mostly likely is a ptsd tick but to get it checked out just incase it is something neurological.

I did have it completely worked up both by my doctor, psychologist, psychiatrist, and a neurologist. There was no physical reason for the tic so it appears that it is a somatic symptom of ptsd. The more I had it worked up the more I noticed other somatic symptoms as well like nausua, tinnitus, stomach pain, and dizziness.
I've noticed now that when I'm about to dissociate first I tic, then I hear a high pitch noise, then I start to go dizzy.

I definitely recommend the same thing to you. It could well be a physical symptom of ptsd, but it's always a good idea to just make sure there's also nothing else going on physically that might cause that reaction."

I've never dissociated at church before but I know that worship music is a trigger for me and a lot of Christmas related things are triggers for me as well. On top of that Ive had a lot of trauma anniversaries in the last week and have more coming up.

I would definitely recommend speaking to your therapist about it if you see anyone. In the meantime, I know being at home for the holidays is so stressful, try and take time for yourself and practice staying grounded as much as you can.
Someone on this sub recently recommended an app for me called Calm Halm that helps me keep my self harm in check, but they maker of that app also has an app for anxiety and grounding that helps a lot too. It's called Clear Fear.
If you need it there's also a crisis line you can call if you're really struggling, you can just text Connect to 741741.

She went through a lot of emotional and verbal abuse when she was growing up and she was bullied very badly at school too.

ptsd,fbgfle4,t3_ed1bxd,1576847915.0,"I stepped into it very slowly with my boyfriend. I dated a little bit after my last traumatic event several years ago but it was difficult because they either judged me for my issues, wanted to fix me, or just didn't care. It made me very anxious so I took a break for about two years.with my current boyfriend on our first date I let him know that I had some trauma in my past that had caused undiagnosed ptsd, usually I can tell by a guy's reaction if it's a relationship worth persueing or if he's not going to be able to handle it. My man took it like a champ even when I asked him to please not ask for details of the trauma. He just took the information and accepted it as it was. a few months into the relationship I was officially diagnosed and he still never tried to fix it or anything like that, he just wanted to be there for me. I chose not to give him too much detail to my traumatic past because I knew just thinking about it and trying to verbalize it would trigger me. He was perfectly happy to take things slowly and respect my boundaries. That's how I knew I was doing the right thing by continuing to date him and it gave him some more time to get to know me and learn some of my triggers and how to help. We had our first sleep over about 10 months in and at that point I decided to give him more of an idea of what ha d happened to me and what to expect because I do have nightmares, night terrors, I twitch and shake, and if he's too pushy for sex or touches me in specific places or specific ways then it triggers violent panic attacks. It's been a year and half ish now and we just moved in together so it's been a learning curve for us both recently.
Anyway, long story short is that you are going to eventually find someone who understands and is happy to learn you and your triggers inside and out and help you through them. It might take some time, you might have a few dates with a few girls that just don't understand, and that's okay. You don't have to answer all their questions or give them all the details. You just have to take things one step at a time and go at your own pace. If they aren't willing to accept that then they aren't the girl for you. You need someone to support you through what you're going through, not someone who wants to try and fix you or make you feel bad for something you're trying hard to work through.
A relationship is all team work. You're looking for your team mate, not your referee."

I wanted to pretend so badly that my trauma didn't exist that it took me a year of therapy to even start acknowledging that there was trauma and even then I couldn't tell my therapist what happened for another 4 or 5 months.

 I've learned recently though that the more you try and minimize it or make yourself feel like others have been through worse or that your trauma isn't valid the more damage you do to yourself.

StopSelfHarm,erm4vch,t3_c2jrfb,1561006218.0,"I'm so sorry you're going through this. There are so many here that want to help, please reach out to one of them.
In the meantime, can you please remove this image from your post? Im less than 24 hours out of a relapse and this image is extremely triggering for me and possibly others."
StopSelfHarm,erkkazj,t1_er1m506,1560965337.0,I relapsed yesterday 😞
selfharm,er67k26,t3_c0iajc,1560541617.0,I'm a 30 year old woman that's been cutting for 20 years. Everyone in high school thought I was just doing it for attention because I wasn't Emo or Goth. It actually forced me into hiding my self harm from everyone and I didn't ask for help for a decade after that because I was so scared that people would mistake me asking for help as me asking for attention. My self harm got much worse for much longer than it needed to because of a few misguided assumptions.
StopSelfHarm,eqzitao,t1_eqrhrvg,1560400738.0,"The crisis hotline gave me a couple of pretty cool tools to use when I'm triggered. The first thing is two apps, Calm harm and Clear Fear. The second thing that's really been helping is doing some grounding exercises. I'm on day 7 and it's still tough, but I'm getting by."
StopSelfHarm,eqnmtlg,t1_eqnc1sl,1560177779.0,I made it but it was by far one of my roughest so far. I called the crisis line 4 times last night.
StopSelfHarm,eqku5cv,t1_eqii8my,1560131189.0,I don't think I'm going to make it through tonight.
StopSelfHarm,eqitnr3,t1_eqii8my,1560093435.0,"It might! I usually get a little frustrated with counting clocks because it's counting an amount of time with out something, but I think if it's counting down it might take a little pressure off because it's going toward the turning point instead of away from it."
selfharm,eqihs82,t1_eqifyv6,1560087242.0,Made it to day 4 but I'm just totally exhausted. How was your night last night?
selfharm,eqh5n87,t1_eqh4b18,1560049628.0,"I'm hanging on. I'm exhausted though. I have distractions ready to go for tonight, I'm coming up to the time of night when it starts to get really hard so I'm preparing for it. I'm just... Tired. Like, I just wanna get some rest, but I know the only way that's going to happen is if I relapse and I'm not going to give in to this."
selfharm,eqh3q8f,t1_eqh1hzx,1560048257.0,"I'm glad you have someone to talk to, I know it's hard to talk to partners about this kind of stuff. I always feel like a huge burden to my partner when I talk about this heavy stuff with him. Two days clean is amazing! I'm so proud of you, just keep going one step at a time. I remember when I got clean two years ago that the first 12 days were the hardest. I'm on day 3 right now, I'm also going hour by hour, even had to text the crisis hotline last night. When I talked to my therapist about it I told her that I felt like I had wasted two years of work and I felt like I had failed. She reminded me that two years clean is over 700 days and that having two bad days in a row where I relapsed doesn't take away those 700+ days when I kicked ass. It did help a little.
How are you holding up tonight? Do you have enough distractions?"
StopSelfHarm,eqfhtju,t1_eqfeje9,1560021032.0,"Made it to day three. It's definitely a minute by minute situation. Ive had to text the crisis hotline a few times but I'm holding on. If I did it for 700ish days before, I can do it again. I just gotta get through the next 9 days and it will start to ease up"
selfharm,eqad71t,t3_bxvfc3,1559930651.0,I relate to that. I feel like I manipulate people into doing things or not doing things mostly so they leaving me alone because I don't want them to see what I've done or I feel like I'm going to be a burden to them. It's very hard to keep relationships when you feel that way.
StopSelfHarm,eq9w1cl,t1_eq9rrri,1559919252.0,"I was thinking about asking my therapist if we could try CBT. Not sure if she does CBT though. I had a really good talk with a friend at church last night too, he definitely encouraged me to get back up and dust myself off. I think the hardest part for me was that I felt like I'd failed so there was no point trying again. He reminded me that I'd been clean for almost two years - that's around 700 days that I fought and won. I can't beat myself up because I had 2 bad days.
This morning marks 24 hours clean. I'm doing this one step at a time right now."
selfharm,eq832tz,t3_bxhbyf,1559857755.0,"Guys, I asked him if we could go for a walk later so we could talk. I'm so anxious right now I feel like I'm going to spiral out of control."
StopSelfHarm,eq6kk2a,t1_eq6jbcd,1559830799.0,I did it again last night too. I'm so scared that I'm falling back into something I can't control. I called my therapists office today to get an emergency appointment. I'm just not sure how much it's going to help. Talk therapy really doesn't do much for me but repeat how crappy I feel.
WomensHealth,eq6jnu9,t3_bxh0da,1559830352.0,"It sounds like your putting your body through a lot of new changes which may have triggered your period a little early. But like the other person said, you can get a pregnancy test to ease your mind if you would like. I would also recommend talking to your doctor as well just to make sure there is nothing medically to worry about."
selfharm,eq6i7bf,t1_eq5hutu,1559829598.0,"Unfortunately, yeah, if you are not legally an adult, they are obligated to report. However, that may not be a bad thing. It may lead you to someone that can help. Stay strong."
selfharm,eq6fcwb,t1_eq5t3ag,1559828124.0,"Welp, totally messed up again like 20 minutes after I wrote that so... That went well😅 I guess it's just another shining example of how the thoughts just creep up on you or sit in your chest for hours/days. I scheduled an emergency appointment with my therapist, hopefully we'll work through this. Is there anyone you can talk to about your relapse?"
selfharm,eq5alyo,t3_bx5fg5,1559796365.0,"Sooo I relapsed last night and took myself to the gym this morning, I felt like I was gonna get caught every minute I was there but literally no one noticed. Like, no one Even so much as glanced at me. It was great.😅

A side note though: this is probably a one in a million thing that may never happen again so you should definitely try and cover up the best you can. Don't be stupid like me."
selfharm,eq59n3c,t3_bxbu3m,1559795754.0,"I feel for you. I live in Florida and this is my number one issue year round! I know you said you didn't have any, but I would strongly recommend trying to get a pair of swim shorts or swim pants to cover up. It's usually the easiest and most nonchalant way to do it. There is waterproof tattoo cover up you can try but it's not really a great solution since it does start to wash off pretty quick of its constantly in water."
selfharm,eq58nwl,t3_bx7nb5,1559795152.0,"It definitely sounds like this could develop into a seriously self harm issue if you don't deal with it a soon as possible. Like some of the others have said, it can turn into a very bad addiction very quickly, and I can speak from experience on this one. I started self harming when I was 11 - I'm 30 now and still struggle with it daily. If there's one thing I wish someone would have told me sooner it is that it's okay to ask for help. Reach out to someone you trust, be open and honest about what's going on. If there's a counselor at your school that might be a good place to start."
selfharm,eq57o1v,t3_bxagfy,1559794536.0,"I totally get it. Last night I relapsed after almost two years clean. Now I'm struggling with the thoughts all over again tonight and I'm pretty sure I'll give in to it again. Stay strong,When you're ready to stop then take the urges as they come and go one step at a time."
WomensHealth,epwm0pt,t3_bw246a,1559579183.0,I honestly had the hardest time with emotional eating and binge eating. I had to go to a therapist to help stop. I strongly recommend therapy to help figure out what your triggers are and then learn how to retrain the behavior into something positive and productive.
