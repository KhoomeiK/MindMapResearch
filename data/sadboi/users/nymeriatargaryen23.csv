Teachers,fdbgx7h,t1_fdbchcl,1578257267.0,"I don‚Äôt think I am 100% wrong, that‚Äôs a pretty absolute statement. Not every teacher works 50-60 hours per week, although a lot do. Like I said, I know several who do not. Everyone is different. Elementary school teachers have it harder I think because they have to do all the subjects. The teachers I know are mostly middle school/high school. 

Work is hard, period. I worked for 2 years selling cabinets to contractors and distributors. I worked 50hrs/wk for 15/hr. No benefits. No paid time off. No health insurance. No maternity leave.
I worked as a vet assistant, 10/hr, no sick leave, 401k, vacation time, health insurance, 1 day off per week (around 50-60 hrs per week) where I sustained back and neck injuries due to the constant heavy lifting of animals, getting bitten several times, and never getting to sit down or have a lunch break. 

So now I‚Äôm in school to be an ESL teacher. A lot of my friends from high school ended up being teachers, and I grew up in a family of teachers and we ate dinner on weeknights and had wonderful weekends and summers together. Like anything, there‚Äôs a trade off. I‚Äôm not saying teaching isn‚Äôt hard, anyone who says that is delusional, but that said it‚Äôs not a bad career and what they pay you can support a decent life. Will you get rich? Hell no. Will there be days where you hate your life and want to quit? Yup. But you get some nice perks too. Which is why lots of people like the OP‚Äôs SIL go into the field. These days people are desperate for anything above 30k with benefits it seems‚Äî and although she underestimated the difficulty I wouldn‚Äôt judge her too harshly is all I‚Äôm saying."

Not because they‚Äôre bad teachers...this isn‚Äôt a black and white issue, some teachers have a great job and get paid a decent amount and find teaching relatively easy, some get paid a lot less and work in crappy districts that enforce crappy rules. I‚Äôm just saying I can see why an outsider would believe that teaching is relatively easy and the pay is relatively good‚Äî because in many ways that is true."

That‚Äôs not always true. I know teachers who work a regular 40 hr work week. It‚Äôs all in how you manage your time and what your district requires. Very important to research districts before applying.

Also, nurses probably put in more time than anyone and while they get paid more, I would say their job is much, much, harder."
Teachers,fd7jvg2,t3_ek1vvv,1578205647.0,"To play devils advocate, the difficulty of teaching depends on what you consider difficult. Teachers do get paid a good amount ( in some states) and do get a tremendous amount of time off ( that almost no other jobs offer). 

She was wrong to judge saying your job is ‚Äúeasy‚Äù. That‚Äôs rude. But for what you‚Äôre getting in return for your work, it‚Äôs not a bad deal. And it‚Äôs true, you do see a lot of not-so-sharp teachers around lol"

Yes, sexual favors take place I‚Äôm not denying that. Seems Ryan Adams is guilty of that as well as other men AND women (trust me, women get by on their looks and their sexual favors here in Nashville TN and they don‚Äôt even hide it) and I‚Äôm sure women threw themselves at Ryan all the time and it wasn‚Äôt always him ‚Äúgrooming‚Äù.

That‚Äôs just one instance, imagine that being his life every day. When you‚Äôre a well respected artist, it‚Äôs easy for things to get skewed.

I just don‚Äôt think this guy deserves to have is career destroyed because he has emotional issues. He needs to see a therapist or something. But when we all come out with our pitchforks saying ‚Äúget help Ryan‚Äù and ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a narcissist‚Äù and writing on the internet as if we even know him personally or have any insight into his real life, do you really think that‚Äôs helping?? Seems more like pure hate to me. Imagine waking up in a world where everyone knows and has access to proof of your wrongdoings and emotional problems. You really think that would help or hurt?!

I think it‚Äôs shameful this was written about in the times and I still can‚Äôt see it as anything else other than a career boost for those women.

I'm not schizoaffective but my BP 1 has been severe enough to almost get me arrested and cost me countless friendships, jobs and too many humiliations to count...I've been in the hospital 4  times involuntarily and it's just trial and error. I'm on lamictal now which seems to really do its job...for now. You never know but I guarantee you it can get better if you want it to"
bipolar,epbamb4,t3_buet2o,1559140034.0,This happened to someone I knew from when I got hospitalized. You'll get through it...she's doing much better now (I follow her Instagram) and has really turned her life around. She's in grad school now

gameofthrones,eov8oac,t1_eov87gj,1558890611.0,In the show or in the books?
gameofthrones,eov6k16,t3_bt7jfp,1558889661.0,"I don't think you're far off. He clearly has a hard time forgiving Sansa, that's obvious from the long pause. And Bran, I think he knows Bran isn't Bran anymore and is just kind of creeped out by him. The only person he really still cares about is Arya, you can tell by their last interaction."

bipolar,eop2xa0,t1_eop1z57,1558753580.0,"You can debate about that all day. I understand what you're saying-- eventually we get bored/sick of things we like doing. You're wondering what the point is...

I think the point is to chase after the little pockets of good in life. Not everything is going to be great and wonderful (gtf off social media, it's toxic) but there are moments that make all the shit worth it. And sharing it with others you love and who love you  enhances that. Lastly, leaving behind a legacy is the final point of our existance. If we are going to die, we want to leave something special behind to be remembered.

First, you need to love yourself. Eat healthy, drink water, take a nice long shower, put on a clay mask, etc. Decide what hobby you are going to start tomorrow. Then stick with it. 

Once you love yourself, people who love you will come around. Because people can sense that energy-- seriously, they can. People will flock to you.

Don't give up!!! There is always a way through this shit. Don't give up a lifetime left of beautiful moments for one horrible moment in your life. It will all get better, I promise you."
bipolar,eop1tke,t3_bspi6o,1558752859.0,"I can relate to feeling totally lonely and abandoned. It fucking sucks. Please don't do what you're thinking about doing. The story isn't over.

You say you don't have talent? Newsflash, people aren't born with talent-- they pick something they like and they hone their skills. What do you like? I know in depression you don't ""like"" anything, but what do you remember enjoying? Whatever it is, go down that path. Pick something to work on. Work on it every day.

I don't know what your living situation is like, but you need to get away from the guy who is making you miserable. Stop thinking about him and these other people who are hurtful and rude to you!! Go somewhere where you can get a clear head, even if you have to live alone it's better than being with people who bring you down.

Make a plan. Your story could get so good, don't cut it short"
Edinburgh,eoo91gx,t1_eonoxa6,1558732600.0,"Just to eliminate my words getting misconstrued again, I want to point out I never mentioned the word quiet. Tourist trap to me means waiting in long lines to see an attraction of some sort. While that is fine and I see nothing wrong with it, what I am looking for is a place a bit less packed (notice how I'm not saying quiet or empty) to sit down and chill and enjoy hanging with my family.maybe something that you've been to or enjoyed that's interesting to you.

The amount of hate this post got and how my original post got twisted and turned into ""I'm too cool for tourists"" is pretty insane. If that's what you want to read, sure, interpret it that way. Imo it was a reasonable question and I'm sure there are answers all over. I'll go find them myself, thanks."

Edinburgh,eoizr6x,t1_eohrwe1,1558630622.0,"The bless your heart thing was a joke. I never say bless your heart, I'm not even from the south. I also know that cunt is a more mainstream thing where you are, so chill. Forgive my ignorance on ""raging belland"" that's new for me... Anyway the time you took to write this back to me is only a sign that you're pretty offended too...hmm, isn't the internet fun? Neither of us know each other but put so much effort into this useless conversation. Thank you for the vocab lesson."
