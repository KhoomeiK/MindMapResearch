To both of these I'd say, don't have a pet. A pet isn't a plaything. A pet is a living creature that has needs, just like people do. A pet is also expensive. Once you have a pet, it's not optional to take care of their needs for the rest of their lives. If you cant take care of a pet (anymore), and it doesn't seem to be temporary issue, the best thing you can do, for the well being of your pet, is to find a home for them where they CAN provide for their needs. I know that's a very hard decision to make, because a person loves their pet, but it's exactly out of that love that they should be wanting what is best for their health and well being. Also, there are pets way better suited for elderly people, that don't require being taken for walks. She doesn't have to be lonely, she just shouldn't have a dog."

Dear cousin and family,

&#x200B;

I was surprised to receive a letter from Holland. I was wondering who could know me there.

It seems to me that I've written to you years ago, before your family members arrived in this country. And I remember reading a letter, that was sent(?) to father(?) in ??...., that you were staying in Zuid Holland (province). I can tell you that I'm am clearly my father's son. When I first went to school, they called me Geertje, but that was too difficult, so then they called me Gerrit. When we moved I went to a different school en then they said I would be called George. That was all right with me and that has been my first name for years. I asked father when you were in America if he wanted to see my brother again, but he wasn't planning on travelling again. He was suffering from his,           and he had trouble going to the bathroom (I think. The word seems to literally be 'watering'), which made it difficult to stray far from home. Well it has been a year ago since he died and we believe and have been witness to his confession, that he perceived himself as a lost sinner, and that his hope was on Christ and his mercy. He has never been very sick and sometimes it was very difficult for him to submit to the will of God. But he was capable of submitting. I have met your family several times, but I've never really gotten to know them well. Namely because we just got married and children followed quickly thereafter. Therefore we never left the house. We had 9 children. We lost two of them in their youth, one at 16 months old and one at 12 days of age. In 1936 and 1940. Our life's path hasn't been sprinkled with roses. ?????  all difficulties.

Our dear Lord has helped us to love him more and more. You asked me to travel to see where my father was born. This will probably never happen. I am almost 58. This will be the 2nd of May, 57. My wife is Berthe Holland, born in Falls(?)... she is 52. She is still young. We have 7 living children. Josephine is married to Dick Hardeman/Herdeman. They have 4 children, 3 girls and a boy. Then comes Ray, he's married to Martine van der Molen, they live in Falls(?) and he is a carpenter. They have two children, a boy and a girl. But Josephine lives close to us on a farm of 200 acres (1 acre is 4047 square metres). Next comes Bu.........., she has lived at home until February 15th 1957 when she married Gary de Graft, who lived in Prairie City(?), about 60 miles west of here D............

Joke has been married for two years to D....van Hachel(?). They live about 2 miles north of us on a farm of about 200 acres.

Beste neef en familie,

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ik was verbaasd een brief uit Holland te krijgen. Ik vroeg me af wie mij daar kan kennen.

Het lijkt me dat ik je jaren geleden heb geschreven, voordat je familieleden naar dit land kwamen. Ik herinner me dat ik een brief gelezen heb, die naar vader(?) in Oo.... gezonden(?) is, dat je in Zuid Holland vertoefde. Ik kan je vertellen dat ik de zoon bij uitstek ben van mijn vader. Toen ik voor het eerst naar school ging, noemde ze mij Geertje, maar dat was te moeilijk, dus noemde ze me Gerrit. Toen we verhuisden ging in naar een andere school en toen zeiden ze dat het George zou zijn. Nu dat was wel goed wat mij betref en zo is dat mijn voornaam geweest voor jaren. Ik vroeg vader toen je in Amerika was of hij mijn broer nog eens wilde zien, maar hij was niet van plan nog te gaan reizen. Hij had last van zijn,            en hij kon nog moeilijk wateren(?), hetwelk het voor hem moeilijk maakte ver van huis te gaan.

Wel het is nu bijna een jaar geleden dat hij stierf en wij mogen geloven, getuige van bekentenis, dat hij zich zelf beschouwde als een verloren zondaar, en dat zijn hoop was gevestigd in Christus en zijn barmhartigheid. Hij is nooit erg ziek geweest en soms was het erg moeilijk voor hem zich te onderwerpen aan de bedoelingen van God. Maar dan weer was hij in staat zich te onderwerpen. Ik heb je familie enige malen ontmoet, maar heb ze nooit erg goed leren kennen. We waren toen n.l. juist getrouwd en we kregen onze kinderen al vrij hauw en dus hebben we ons huis helemaal nooit verlaten. We hadden 9 kinderen. We verloren er twee in hun jeugd, een van 16 maanden en een van 12 dagen, resp. In 1936 en 1940. Ons levenspad is niet bestrooid geweest met rozen. ???? alle moeilijkheden Onze Lieve Heer heeft ons geholpen om hem meer en meer te beminnen. Je vroeg me over te komen om te zien waar vader was geboren. Dat zal waarschijnlijk nooit gebeuren. Ik ben bijna 58. Dit zal zijn ?? de 2e mei 57. Mijn vrouw is Berthe Holland, geboren in Pelle/Fells(?)...

Zij is 52. Zij is nog jong. We hebben 7 levende kinderen. Josephine is getrouwd met Dick Herdeman. Zij hebben 4 kinderen, 3 meisjes en een jongen. Vervolgens komt Ray, hij is getrouwd met Martine van der Molen, zij wonen in Pells/Fells? and he is a carpenter.

Zij hebben twee kinderen, een jongen en een meisje. Maar Josephone woont vlak bij ons op een boederij van 200 acres (1 acre is 4047 vierkante meter). Vervolgens komt Bu............, zij is thuis gebleven tot de 15e februari 1957 toen zij trouwde met Gary de Graft, die in Prairie City (?) woonde, zo ongeveer 60 mijlen ten westen van ons nabij D.............

Joke is nu twee jaren getrouwd met D.... van Hachel. Zij wonen ongeveer 2 mijlen ten noorden van ons op een boerderij van ongeveer 200 acres."
AskVegans,fftkpfp,t3_ev4ipm,1580223055.0,"I think many of the comments here are rather harsh. Personally, I'm vegan, because of all the known and often mentioned reasons. That doesn't mean that every single person that cares about improvement of animal rights can ONLY do so by being vegan. It is the preferred and ideal way, sure, but if  you were to cut back on your meat intake and buy your meat at a biological supermarket/butcher, it's a good step from where most meat eaters are at. It at the very least shows you are mindful and willing to change your diet and go through extra effort for animal well being.  I've seen people around me slowly change towards a more plant based diet and seeing more and more sense in it,  for health reasons as well. Some of them were heavy meat consumers and now they are (almost completely) vegetarian. I  see this as a major win. I wish more vegans in general would allow others to discover their own path towards less cruelty, without guilting them or scaring them off with harsh black & white view remarks. Compassion, gentle encouragement and patience really is key, in my opinion."

femalefashionadvice,f8bs0vc,t3_e00z40,1574443993.0,"Don't try to aim for perfection. That's the most important mantra to live by imo. I still buy new clothes from non-sustainable brands, but I will wear them for years to come. If I end up not liking them for whatever reason, I sell them again secondhand. The majority of my wardrobe comes from secondhand stores and apps (like Vinted). The money that I make from selling these clothes, I will use to buy 'new' ones again. This way I try to be sustainable AND friendly on my wallet."
