i personally am not ace/aro but i thought i was for a while. ace, that is. for me personally: i don't know. it's extremely difficult for me to sort through whether or not i'm romantically attracted to someone or not. with women anyway (bisexual here). men, i can usually sort through pretty easily? and with them it just has to do with like. 'can i see myself doing typical couple stuff with him like going on dates, kissing and snuggling, holding hands down the street, going through the typical issues couples go through, etc. 

if the answer isn't a resounding 'yes,' to most/all of those, i tend to err on the side of not being romantically attracted to him and just being really intensely platonically in love with him. or like. queerplatonically in love with him (which btw is a GREAT word and i wish it'd become more popular again, saw it EVERYWHERE like 8-10 years ago). 

but yeah, i'd also see if you could get some perspective from ace/aro communities on here cause i'm sure that'd help. best of luck figuring it out."

so i corrected them. and still got called a dyke (someone even called me a half dyke once and like i still beat their ass but i kinda looked at them like '....really?' before i did lmfao) and got into fights and bullied and shit lmao but at least they knew who tf i was and what tf i was about. my parents know and they're chill w it.

forgiveness is possible, but not mandatory. even if you better yourself, the people you previously hurt are not obligated to let you back into their lives. 

if she's blocked you on everything, she most likely never wants to speak to you again, or at least not at the moment, so i wouldn't push. yeah, maybe she'll come around and want to work on it later, but honestly?

i hit my 20's and just became a complete trainwreck. my first time moving away from my parents was so bad because my symptoms were so unmanageable i had to move back with them (still am there now while i stable out and save up money to move out again). 

and the working memory thing has definitely gotten worse for me i think. either it's gotten worse, or i'm just noticing it more often. i try to work with it by just putting reminders in my phone for EVERYTHING. and making heavy use of the notes app. notes and reminders are my best friends on my phone. i find physically writing things down helps too sometimes, though i lose things easily as well so if i write it down on a piece of paper and lose the paper, i'm screwed. i never lose my phone because i'm a Physically Attached Millennial so i know if it's in my notes/reminders app i'll easily be able to access it.

lesbian separatism is a big reason we argue about a lot today. radfems did a damn good job of essentially erasing bisexual women from lesbian history, so now people seem to think we just swooped in and stole everything when really, we helped build this community and culture. 

besides the fact, butch and femme aren’t even wlw/lesbian exclusive. queer people of all sexualities and genders have been using them for decades. the violent policing that’s been happening lately in websites like tumblr and twitter was started by radical feminists and terfs. 

a quick google search on ballroom culture will tell you that, and i have some other sources too highlighting the deliberate erasure of bisexual women and, actually, trans women from lesbian culture and history.

bisexual,fedfyhc,t1_fedewer,1579010471.0,"i feel this. i actually thought i was a trans man for several years just from feeling detached from womanhood, trauma, and mostly having guy friends. 

but once i started to realize that there’s no right way persay to ‘participate’ in ‘womanhood’ i just started doing it in ways that felt comfortable for me. which for me feels like lesbian culture and femme culture. other than that, womanhood is like. weird and unreachable for me lol"

bisexual,fedee83,t3_eol1i0,1579009212.0,"my gender and sexuality definitely intersect and affect each other in weird ways. i feel like a bisexual woman, but if you take out the bisexual part, there’s just. nothing there. i relate to a lot of lesbian/femme history and culture and feel like how essentially a lot of non binary lesbians feel i imagine? except i’m bisexual. 

when i like women, i feel more like a woman, myself. i feel very connected to womanhood through that bond i guess and that history? or something? 

when i like guys i...don’t really feel like much of anything gender wise. agender i guess would be the word to describe it. i feel very detached from the concept of gender as a whole. i kinda feel like ‘giddy schoolgirl’ sometimes in terms of crushing on guys but that’s about it. 

as for non binary people, it’s a toss up depending on the person. usually with nb people tho i tend to also feel pretty detached, unless they, like me, are also fem/femme aligned."

BPD,feciish,t3_eofx9a,1578974749.0,"i feel this. i thought i was a lesbian for a while due to trauma and just due to the fact that even before said Trauma i preferred women anyway. i still do prefer women, and am wary about dating men, but i still am attracted to them and would date them. 

i guess my main difference now is that i would definitely have casual hookups with other women as well as serious relationships, but not with men. men i have to get to know and trust before i let them in like that. which is fine by me, i’m not too bothered by the shift considering i always preferred women anyway. just sucks that men can be so fucking terrible that they ruin all of them for us when i’m 100% aware there are wonderful kind and loving guys out there."
bisexual,febwjlf,t1_febvo76,1578963519.0,"tbh i don’t blame you for that. i wish  you didn’t feel the need to do that, but i get it. mainstream LGBTQ+ organizations ignore us completely and if you prefer the ‘opposite’ gender, like yourself, they’re straight up hostile. easier to just continue to blend in even if that sucks too."

actuallesbians,fe8ncc4,t3_eo5124,1578928238.0,"fanfic helped me. i know like, as a whole, fanfic has its issues but getting into fandom culture and stuff was the first time i even learned what being gay was. i saw stories with two men together and was like, ‘WOAH, two guys can like each other like that? cool.’ 

took me a bit for the lightbulb to turn on irt girls as well but once it did i was like ‘HANG ON THAT MEANS-‘"

bisexual,fe7upsa,t3_eo35j5,1578919469.0,"i prefer dating other bi+ people honestly. i haven’t been with a monosexual person in a looooong time. other bi+ people just don’t have the weird hang ups about us that a lot of monosexuals have. now, this isn’t me painting ALL monosexuals as biphobic or anything, it’s just. easier for me to connect to other bi+ people cause they Get It. 

my current partner is also bisexual and polyamorous so he doesn’t ask stupid questions, doesn’t say stupid shit, and because he’s also polyamorous, we can talk about negotiating how we would want to find other partners while being in a relationship, ourselves. it’s nice."

a girl i had a crush on in middle school stopped talking to me after she found out about it, but then in 10th grade, two years later,  she had also come out as bi. i was like COME ON MAN YOU COULDNT HAVE GOTTEN OVER YOUR HOMOPHOBIA TWO YEARS EARLIER TO MAKE MY LIFE A LITTLE LESS MISERABLE??"
