sex,fcp1k9i,t3_egeuyq,1577847647.0,"I had an IUD put in about a month or so ago, and so far it's been alright! I think it's worth a try since they're way more effective than BCP + condoms and last a really long time.  (Though I should add that where I come from, IUDs are fully covered) 

I got the hormonal put in because it helps with lessening periods and I haven't had any terrible side effects as of yet! Though if I were to nitpick, I'd say I've been a little more sensitive // emotional about things that otherwise wouldn't have bothered me. If you're afraid of messing with hormones, you can check out copper IUDs instead!"

relationships,ezsy1lm,t3_d221tn,1568114898.0,"My brother (16) and I (19) have this EXACT issue with our dad. He’d message us some time during the day asking us why we are where we are, or shoot us a seemingly harmless text about our location, for instance: 

“Why aren’t you at school?” 
“I see you’re just staying home today” 
“Why are you at your boyfriend’s house? No homework?” 
“Say hi to (insert friend’s name) to me!”
“Eating at Wendy’s? Yum!”

and it drives us up the fucking wall. It’s harmless in practice and I know he checks it cause he cares, but it makes us so wildly uncomfortable to have to explain our location all the time// have him stalk us like that. 

My brother recently deleted the app, cold turkey, and my dad had an absolute meltdown, calling him “selfish” for making him worry like that. I feel that this is extremely unfair, how on earth did you decide to become a parent BEFORE this app even existed?

Besides the point, it’s still a sore issue at home but my brother has not since reinstalled the app. Is my dad pissed? Yes. 
Does he bring it up often? Yes. 
Does my brother care? No lol. 
Should you delete the app? Hell yeah, if my 16 year old brother can get away with it then a 20 year old adult such as yourself can! But be prepared for grief from your mother’s end. 
Do I still have the app? Yes, unfortunately, but perhaps this post is the right nudge for me to finally delete it.

Godspeed, OP."

AskReddit,eyoxs12,t3_cxrgdq,1567285171.0,"My high school friend and I had been on rocky terms since senior year. She was always too proud and stubborn. She would hold our arguments over my head and guilt me into thinking they were all my fault. Perhaps I was naïve, but I bought into her and apologized and caved in every time we fought (whether it was truly my fault or not). During these fights, she would always threaten to leave me. Admittedly, I think I was holding on to the early years of our friendship, and thought what a waste it would be to let go of our time together rather than the quality of those years. 

 One day, I decided enough was enough and stood my ground, even suggesting that we take a small break from each other to cool off. I truly believed she would take this time to finally own up and apologize first. 

She later messaged me that day, ending things completely, saying I was being too proud and “rude” for not apologizing to her first (like before) and said: “Thanks for wasting 5 years of my life” 

They say that love is hard —that you have to fight tooth and nail and compromise to keep the people you love in your life. But there’s nothing wonderful about begging someone to love you. I had been her doormat for years and it took this statement to make me realize how truly toxic our friendship was."
