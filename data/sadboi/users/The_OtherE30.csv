ExNoContact,fr1gtun,t1_fr1fuoa,1589819481.0,"Exactly why I stopped talking to her after a week, before contacting her we had a lot of built up emotions from unresolved things. So being able to meet up with her and get all those things off my mind while both of us apologized and realized how petty some of the arguments we had really helped me a lot. 


I KNOW, exactly what would happen if I tried to be friends with my ex, I‚Äôm almost certain I could maintain a friendship with her and she‚Äôd like it, but I have no interest in staying friends with someone I use to have intense feelings for. I‚Äôd much rather just put it in the past and move forward. Plus, you can‚Äôt let your ex have their cake and eat it too.

I know some people are at the point that they can‚Äôt even talk to their ex in fear their emotions will get the better of them. I‚Äôm past that point and really just don‚Äôt care to have a friendship with a person such as my ex.


You have to ask yourself what do these people do to benefit our lives? The answers 0. Most people who are dumpees don‚Äôt realllly wanna be friends with their ex, they‚Äôll put up with being their ‚Äúfriend‚Äù in hopes of maybe becoming more. I‚Äôll tell you right now that‚Äôs not gonna work. That‚Äôs why I came back for a week, showed my better self and what I had to offer, felt it out and realized there‚Äôs legit nothing here for me anymore. So I offed it. 


I know this can be hard for people to hear, but for those who are deeply imbedded in their emotions still need to understand that one day you‚Äôre going to have to get rid of the emotional aspect and look at it through the reality and realistically of your situation and your ex/past relationship and just save yourself all that torment and sadnesses
You deserve so much better after all"

This right here is what it‚Äôs like about in terms of learning. My ex left me 8 months ago and our relationship was a 6 month shit show. I think one of the biggest things I learned was that my ex isn‚Äôt anybody special by any means. If you were to go through my post history you‚Äôd see that I put 110% of myself in that relationship and did things for my mentally ill ex that you‚Äôd be baffled by. 

I learned to value my self respect the most out of anything, I realize now that I‚Äôm an amazing person, if my ex doesn‚Äôt want to stick around then that‚Äôs simply her loss not mine. She lost someone who‚Äôd do anything for her while I lost someone who left me high and dry by myself. I learned to ask myself ‚Äúis this person good enough for me?‚Äù Instead of ‚Äú am I good enough for this person?‚Äù 

I think after a break up our ego and self esteem is in the dumps. After we pull ourselves together we can really start to appreciate the things we learn and can really see things a lot clearer.

We met up and actually started hanging out. We talked about our past issues and what had been going on in life, we had both changed. I tried to maybe attempt to feel the waters to see if maybe she wanted to rekindle something but it was quickly seen as that being a no. I stopped talking to her all together and left it at that. We were maybe in contact for a week and a half. 

Sometimes it‚Äôs better to realize your self worth and understand how amazing you yourself are and just let it go. Don‚Äôt waste your time or energy on someone like that. If you wanna break NC and see how things are with them I‚Äôd say go for it. But it may not turn out how you‚Äôd expect...even after a long period of time.

I had friends sure, but on the inside I was so hopeless and lost, a piece of me wasn‚Äôt able to keep living and so it died. I‚Äôm a different person because of all those things, I learned so many lessons and grew because of it. 


Has it been hard? Dude...fuck yes it‚Äôs been hard, if you asked me I never wanted any of this to happen, I fucking hate break ups. I went to work looking like shit just completely on autopilot, I spent my days working and being sad, when I was free I‚Äôd hang out with my 3 friends and they helped me get through it. I thanked them for being there for me. 

from November 2019 to March 2020 was the hardest time of my life thus far, I made some unforgettable memories with my friends and went through LIFE changing pain. I was thankful for the pain, I knew it was helping me in some way even if everywhere I looked I saw sadness. 


Do I miss those times? Honestly, kinda. Would j go back? FUCK NO. Do I still struggle even after meeting up with my ex? Yes of course! 


My ex and I reconnected last week and we‚Äôve been in contact for maybe a little over a week? I cut it off and have gone off with my life now, did it suck? Yes. Was she the woman I thought she was in my mind? No. I kept looking at her potential not her reality. I love my ex more then words could express. 



After this massive journey. You wanna know what I received and value the most? 

My new found self respect. I started asking myself ‚Äú is she good enough for me?‚Äù Is this the woman I want? And after asking myself those things I realized I didn‚Äôt want her and I didn‚Äôt want to waste any more of my amazing special love and care on someone who just didn‚Äôt deserve it. 
It‚Äôs crazy the things I‚Äôve learned and you‚Äôll learn them to on this mission.

Streetracing,fqnqv2z,t3_gjwxkg,1589499715.0,"First of all get that shit out of auto mode and do your own shifting. 

you need to downshift more so that you're in your powerband during your corner exits. Having the car doing the shifting will cause lag and shutter through your cornering and make the car fight you not with you. Come into corners doing all your braking BEFORE the apex, If you're braking while in the corner you're going too fast and have entered the corner wrong. Apex to end of corner should be nothing but power on, roll the throttle don't stab it, If you're looking to set some times that's what you need to work on and practice, if you want to educe a slide then keep stabbing the throttle.   

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

your throttle input seems a bit shaky, try to keep it tamer and more controlled, Also you keep correcting your streering to your outside line, Make sure to come in as wide as you can before cutting in and thus causing you to correct. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'm not sure of your braking set up but you could probably come into those corners a little hotter with better high temp fluid/brake set up and tires.
The stock M235i brakes are great but fade quickly especially when pushing their limits.

Make sure that when these thoughts come over you you LET them come, and pass. Try to remember that your ex isn't a superhero.

I‚Äôm just thankful for the lessons I‚Äôve been taught and how well I‚Äôve handled this all down the road, I think the key to it all is to just remember to not be hard on yourself, let your thoughts think about the good times and the bad but let it pass.

ExNoContact,fluhrwb,t3_fr8vjf,1585502859.0,"For me it's different and maybe more painful? My ex broke up with me 5 months ago. We had a up and down relationship that lasted 6 months, She was very mentally ill and i stepped up to support her 1000% and arguably way more in our share of the relationship, near the end She switched on me and completely changed up. she dumped me and turned on me for her best friends. in the end she did some pretty nasty things to me and left me like that. 

&#x200B;

i was extremely angry, I never wanted to talk to her or see her again. I was so hurt i was angry at myself for giving so much of myself to someone who treated me like that, all along i thought she ""loved me"" I was crazy in love with her. I loved her to a fault. Loved her wayyyy to much but i was so hurt and destroyed i was sure she had changed into a completely different person and i didn't want anything to do with her. it's been almost 6 months now. I'm still madly in love with her, overtime my brain slowly let go of everything. I let EVERYTHING GO, i let the water wash away anything that didn't stick. After all that all that was left was the good memories and the Image of her that i remember. And I still get reminded of her daily. So even though she hurt me so badly and back stabbed me i'm still over here with so much love in my heart for her. I really wish the best for her too. SO i guess I'm done too? In a way."

This is why I believe relationships can go through break ups and still survive and that‚Äôs my opinion."

Yes exs can totally get back together and make a relationship work, should they? That‚Äôs entirely up to both people and how mentally ready/mature they are."

We dated 6 months and it was a roller coaster of emotions. She‚Äôs quite mentally ill, suffering from major depressive disorder and anxiety issues. Lots of self esteem issues as well. I loved her wayyyyy to much, I supported her through everything and was always there for her, she broke up with me and totally switched. She then grew to hate me and the last I heard from her was a month ago when she told me to not try and contact her parents or brother. 


I‚Äôll probably always love her and still get sad sometimes about it all but that‚Äôs life :/ I had hoped we could‚Äôve meet up later in a year or so to sit down and talk like adults about things but i dont know if that‚Äôll happen now considering she hasn‚Äôt changed."

Of course, I was the one talking about getting an apartment and or maybe moving in with me, again an 18F and 20M you can tell i dreamed big at the time lol....she suffers from MDD or Major depressive disorder as well as anxiety and self insecure issues that really demanaged our relationship. She self harmed before I met her and in July of 2019 made an attempt on her life, I was able to thankfully stop her from going any further then she already did and we spent the next 10 days in the psychiatric ward as she was put on watch. It was super draining. I mean watching the woman I loved become consumed and completely withheld by a sickness you can‚Äôt see or immediately directly treat. 


I had to learn as we went, I wasn‚Äôt ignorant to these kinds of mental health issues I just didn‚Äôt know anything about them. So not only was I trying to keep our relationship healthy and happy I also had to learn how to live with a SO with severe mental health issues. As time went on I became very consumed and almost ‚Äútrapped‚Äù in a way. It wasn‚Äôt her fault, god knows I loved that girl wayyy to much. Her parents loved me and looked at me with amazement and respect, it got to the point where I would manage her medication and make sure she was taking it properly while also trying my hardest to make sure she would attend school too. Her education was a train wreck and so school was very difficult to attend. 


As the relationship went on I filled her glass more and more while leaving mine shallower and shallower. She use to say she never deserved someone like me and that turned into her disrespecting Me. She started to care less about self and thus less about me. She pushed me further and further away while spending more time with her friends (that I gave her) and then once school started back up again last September she had enough, she didn‚Äôt go and I put pressure on her to attend as she was skipping school to hang out with friends while using mental health days as a cover up. She broke up with me and I think I stuck around for about a month after trying to repair what was lost. 


In the end of it all I told her I wasn‚Äôt able to be her friend and she didn‚Äôt like that. She really showed her true colours and became very nasty and cold. She threw me away like nothing and that was in November, she contacted me 3 months later to tell me to stop talking to her parents and her brother( it had been over a month since I contacted either of them) 

And that‚Äôs it, I left out a lot of details as to not hijack your thread but needless to say, it was a crazy ‚Äúfirst relationship‚Äù

She suffers from serious Mental health issues and we had to go through some extremely tough things together in the short time we were together. Looking back i gave 110% in that relationship where as she gave more like 50%. it was both our first relationship and needless to say it was extremely tough for me, during our relationship i was always thinking ahead and trying to plan for our future together where as she wasn't. It was clear who was more set up and ready to take on the real rolls of a relationship. She broke up with me because she couldn't handle it anymore and it really really messed me up.
