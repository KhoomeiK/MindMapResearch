Are you ok with possibly being out $100 if you don't have space to store them and you have to drop them at Goodwill or something?

These are the questions I ask myself whenever I happen across a new pair of speakers.

I personally would buy them, just because I have a fondness for Kenwood stuff and they look pretty cool. If they didn't sound great I would use them as garage speakers or something.

The 13th is my girlfriend's birthday, and for the first 2 seasons I bought tickets to the game near that day for her. They're usually expensive as hell and this year I wasn't going to be able to afford them. I guess she told a lady who we volunteer with and she gifted us her season tickets for the game against St Louis.

We didn't know it at the time but that was Subban's last home game with the VGK. It was an amazing, back and forth drama show that we won in OT.

The next day I was at work and I got a text from my girlfriend. She won tickets to the next 2 games against the Islanders which ended up being a tight 1-0 shutout for us that started with a Reaves fight, and the capitals which was a hard fought 3-2 VGK victory.

It was the greatest weekend ever. I have a YouTube playlist of the highlights from those 3 games and I watch them often. I actually think I'm going to watch them right now."

vintageaudio,fdqwijt,t1_fdqdgzh,1578675858.0,"I bought it for $13 at Goodwill a couple years ago. It had a little static that would come and go in the left channel so I thought nothing of it. It worked fine for a while but then one day the static came back strong and it started popping, so I shut it off.

I opened it up to take a look and sure enough there was a blown capacitor. I am not a handy person and have little experience soldering and basically no experience with testing electronics so I thought I better find a professional. As one commenter above stated the place I found was a little hole in the wall with so much vintage gear packed in there that you feel like it's going to cave in on you. Even better behind the counter has dozens of units waiting to be repaired and two guys working to repair other units in plain sight. Obviously people who have gear like this trust these people to work on them.

When I handed mine over they said it would be 5-8 weeks because of the amount of work they have and I came in just before Thanksgiving. 

They replaced 2 capacitors and one transistor and gave me the old parts in a little bag, and the receipt says 'Replaced parts listed. Resoldered cold connections on PCB. Cleaned pots and controls as needed. Adjusted bias and DC offset. Tested frequency response. Heat tested unit to verify performance. OK.'

Parts were $13 and labor was $230 so it cost me just under $250. I can't complain because I basically paid nothing for it and now I have a solid unit that should last a long time. The work done has a 60 day warranty.

And yes it was made in Japan."
