BipolarReddit,fqcle97,t3_gi3405,1589261346.0,"So weird question: have you tried controlling them? I find somewhere in dreamland, I can. To the point I can guide dreams or turn out of weird things. Know it might sound nuts, but if you can manage it, itâ€™s fascinating. I learn a lot and can sometimes redial into the previous nights dreams almost like an extended adventure. The latter happened way more in my teenage years, but it was fun to almost choose your own adventure.  Most I have managed is a couple of months wandering through. A strange dreamscape. My husband swears itâ€™s not possible ( heâ€™s comparatively normal). But my head like yours is wired weirdly. Iâ€™ve had some dark ass dreams over the years and however you want to describe it, lucid dreaming has helped. It tends to happen most in that twilight area between dreams and awake. Once I have some degree of influence, even the darkest dreams seem more manageable. I  have no idea how common this coping mechanism is or even how possible it is for others. All I can say is try to take control. It helped me to ameliorate a lot of dark, scary stuff and even to solve problems in my sleep. 

I wish you all the luck, as scary dreams disrupt sleep and sort of suck the life out of you. ðŸ¤—"

StoriesAboutKevin,fpvp1v7,t1_fpvm38p,1588949166.0,"Yeah I get how it could sound BS. I go on too long at times and give too much detail in some cases. 

I am currently stuck out in said hick town for the duration of Covid, as Iâ€™m taking care of my mom who is older and has some of the underlying health conditions. Iâ€™m fortunate enough to work remotely, so I can help her as Iâ€™m an only and she doesnâ€™t have anyone else.

Iâ€™m bored out of my mind some days, as while I can go outside unlike some less fortunate friends of mine who are still in cities, I have to be really careful when I go out to keep her safe. So no social interaction beyond occasional trips to the shops that are very carefully managed. 

That means I get stuck in my head some days thinking about this weird little place and why I left and never wanted to come back. Some days, I find good memories. Kind neighbors who helped out in weird situations. Other days, I remember how dumb some of the situations kids got themselves into here, as they like me were bored out of their minds growing up. Until I got to college in the city, I thought this was what the world was like for everyone. Jocks being raised on pedestals with their accompanying requisite cheerleader girlfriends. Smart kids, different kids, anyone who didnâ€™t fit the mold were exiled to the sidelines.  Everyone knowing your business almost before you did. I still donâ€™t get how local gossip here travels that fast!

I was lucky enough to get out and see more of the world. Most folks stayed and the cycle perpetuates itself. 

For me personally, that means a lot of Kevin/a stories resurface in my head. Things Iâ€™d tried to block out over the years, as I really kind of hated and was periodically embarrassed by my home town once I got out. Donâ€™t get me wrong: there are a lot of amazing and good people in these parts. Itâ€™s just the combination of bored kids who werenâ€™t always so bright, leads to a lot of Kevin style events. 

So no, itâ€™s not creative writing. Itâ€™s more my own efforts to seek sanity in a crazy time and come to terms with where I grew up. The funnier tales I share here, hoping they might make someone else smile and give them a brief respite from the new normal."

- find a boss you can trust and let them know your diagnosis. This has been huge for me working in a consultancy, as my boss is lovely and she understands how I need to shift workflows at some times
- know what youâ€™re good at in each state - when Iâ€™m depressed, I need mindless things (spreadsheets, admin, mundane research,etc). When manic, I need engaging things (new idea generation, think outside the box / there is no box project creation, story telling, extreme research). 
- accept yourself - this is the way you are and the more you fight it, the less productive you can become. Some of our quirks are what my firm likes to call spikes, but are basically special skills from bipolar
- know when to outsource if possible - if a giant spreadsheet lands on my desk, if Iâ€™m manic, I know we get better outcomes if I supervise and ask questions vs trying to do it myself
- recognize particularly for introvert bipolar that recharge time is important. Itâ€™s a heavy load to deal with mentally and if youâ€™re high functioning; containing from others. I personally find the whole thing exhausting at times and try to sneak naps
- find your happy place at work: I know... I now sound like a bad self help book, but for me:
- working from home helps as long as I can maintain structure 
- ensuring that if Iâ€™m in an office, I know a quiet thinking spot. Whatever, wherever it is to decompress during the day
- donâ€™t judge your productivity by mania - there will be ups and downs
- be kind to yourself and others - many people donâ€™t get bipolar or how to make accommodations for it. We have to have both a thick skin around comments and also proactive ideas for solutions. For many managers this is new territory . We need to make it work for all of us
- avoid burnout at all costs - Iâ€™ve had this twice now and it sucks. When Iâ€™m manic, I feel like whoâ€™s who can do know wrong. Depressed, I wonder where they found an idiot like me some days. Which In turn hurts my mood and makes the situation worse

StoriesAboutKevin,fpbb8jh,t1_fparyt6,1588466093.0,"Thanks. Itâ€™s just so frustrating! I explained why it was a very irresponsible idea to her afterwards and she responded:

 â€˜Oh itâ€™s my friends. I wouldnâ€™t do it with anyone else. Iâ€™m an adult...No one tells me what to do!â€™ and then proceeded to sulk for an hour.

The really Kevina part of that second chat was that she was up on a LADDER, TWO STORIES UP, having had a DOUBLE KNEE REPLACEMENT a few years ago, complaining Iâ€™d put the ladder up the wrong way when I was using it the other day. Aka she climbed up laboriously to the top, without bothering to reposition it or having a spotter in place. 

Kevina OF COURSE climbed up the ladder as part of her ongoing tantrum while I was going to get paint cans and didnâ€™t have my eye on her.

I, of course, canâ€™t get her down off of said very tall ladder without shaking her off or something. Clearly, not going to do that! So instead I hold it for her, while drips globs of red paint on my head and spouts off about her independence.

The backstory as to why she was allowed near said ladder, is that I try to get her outside and keep her busy so she doesnâ€™t go too nuts during Covid with LIGHT tasks on the ground. That way she is outside which she likes and feels like she accomplished something.

This time, she was supposed to be painting a small area of trim on the ground. Not pulling the elderly Kevina tantrum equivalent of â€˜I donâ€™t care if Iâ€™m doing something dangerous, Mom! Iâ€™m tough!!! You canâ€™t make me come down or do anything I donâ€™t wanna!!!!â€™

Kevina is not normally as irresponsible as she was today and does not have a death wish. She just is incredibly stubborn and throws one hell of a temper tantrum.

I swear itâ€™s like parenting a very old, very grumpy teenage Kevina at times!"
aww,fp9z0ea,t1_fp9ni62,1588437484.0,You might even try a heating pad on low with a heat safe cat bed or towel on your sofa or near your chair. Warm tummies = happy kitties.

britishshorthair,fp78c3t,t3_gber1k,1588365883.0,"Congratulations! One thing outside of food and litter recommendations, as I think those are very well covered.

Based on mine: multiple beds, blankets, sleepy places for rest. His majesty tended to migrate between multiple thrones through the day. Nests in sun beams were highly favored. :)

They also tend to be very smart besides being very lazy. Intellectual stimulation is important. Assuming indoor pet, window access for people and creature watching or better yet closed yard or porch access are appreciated.

Cat grass is good for sometimes iffy tummies. Donâ€™t be surprised if food type preferences change periodically. Yesterdayâ€™s favorite food is todayâ€™s boring. He never seemed to go off dry so I kept that on the side as backup.

Exercise is a must. They are lazy at times. A variety of toys like feathers on a string or chaseable things are popular. A clear high running path is also appreciated- tops of sofas, chairs, etc tend to become a fun race course at weird moments, including Zoom calls.

They like dogs, but can occasionally bully the more timid ones - mine used to delight in slapping our pug on the butt with sheathed claws when the pug was at the top of stairs. Never failed as entertainment. But some days the pug was unimpressed.

Final thing is try to find out your new babyâ€™s blood type. British Shorthairs have a 40% chance of having Type B blood. Devons do too. The rest of the US feline population is under 1%. I say this as I found this out the hard way when a transfusion was needed. Wish Iâ€™d known upfront, so I could have made plans.

Congratulations again - one of the most loving and loyal breeds out there! Iâ€™m sure you will have a wonderful relationship :)"
BipolarReddit,fp6ba23,t3_gbh6z1,1588349373.0,"Iâ€™m so sorry for your loss. It hurts unimaginably to lose someone that close. Everyone experiences pain differently, so even though Iâ€™ve had a similar experience, I canâ€™t know what youâ€™re feeling. What I can offer is a little hope from my own experience that others may have seen your friend for who they were and that the saint thing is largely BS contrived to supposedly make people feel better. In my view, it doesnâ€™t. 

One of my best and most trusted friends did the same. He was never diagnosed. Thought meds were â€˜bullshitâ€™. But his symptoms were similar to mine. Stay up for days working and shooting pool at night or doing crazy projects in his garage. Then disappear for a bit, crawl into a very dark hole of depression.

He knew me better than just about anybody. Warts and all. He was incredibly kind to me, but whether up or down he had an incredible temper (e.g., I remember a very rough fight with a guy at night over a parking space. Friend was teetotal, so was just his crazy at play). Most creatively foul mouthed person Iâ€™ve ever met. Atheist. 

Like your friend, he killed himself. Heâ€™d lost his job and I knew he was fighting with his wife. Asked him how he was feeling. He said heâ€™d get by. Then he went radio silent for a bit (normal when he was down). 

At his funeral, he was deemed a godly man by three different priests. His wife is religious. Sheâ€™d forced him to go to services. In the service, he went from sinner to saint. When I spoke, I started with â€˜this is bullshit,â€™ referring to his suicide followed by a couple of toned down but colorful stories. I said how much he loved his wife and family too, with nice but real stories there. Itâ€™s the first time Iâ€™ve ever seen applause at a funeral. Like everyone in the room exhaled at once. Glad to remember that he was a real person who was loving and fun as hell, but had his own demons and could be a pain in the butt. Iâ€™m glad I spoke out, but really only did so because the god squad had basically elevated him to sainthood.

This happened last year and I started kicking myself every day for not catching it. Now itâ€™s every week or so. I recognize I couldnâ€™t have known, but I loved him as a friend so much and knew him so well, that I feel I should have known somehow.

From my experience, it gets better, but it still hurts.

Kitchenaid,fp3guwz,t1_fp27tc8,1588279073.0,"100% true. IF OP plans to cook a lot, KitchenAid is well worth it. I love mine and think the attachments are amazing. 

Issue is if they are wedding gifts you â€˜should haveâ€™, youâ€™re on a cooking spree due to Covid and donâ€™t feel like youâ€™re going to cook later, you only cook sometimes and normally go out or order in. Basically, if you plan to use a KitchenAid a lot, it can do a ton of cool things and last for many, many years. But the price may not be justified depending on planned usage patterns."
jobs,fp3fi3l,t1_fp29fjw,1588278402.0,"I hate to say it, but I still wouldnâ€™t trust Facebook for an announcement if OP is that worried. The world is small in many industries. Unless Facebook is truly limited to close friends and family which is rare for many of us, stuff gets around. Facebook friends with colleagues? Facebook friends with people who you sort of know who work at potential employers? People who like your posts or repost in their excitement? Thinking friends / relatives. Even on lockdown, FB is hard to control.

Itâ€™s a lot of risk here, when OP already has a lot going on with pregnancy and job hunting.

Iâ€™d consider going old school - physical cards, ecards, group email to close people that you know are safe (less likely to share), group text to start fun banter (again with close folks).

The latter is more personal and I get the urge to shout excitement from the hills, but OP - it may not be worth it until you land the new role. Then post away. Good part is also that you make those closest to you feel really good about being in the know and that you care enough about them.

OP - Most importantly- congratulations and good luck in your job hunt!"
BipolarReddit,fp3dxni,t1_fp371uw,1588277625.0,"Cool - always like to ask

Yeah itâ€™s tough. Obvious ones:
Do you drink caffeine too late or are unusually sensitive to it?
Do you take any ADHD type meds and if so, too late in the day?
Do you have any sounds where you sleep that might bother you? 
Is it too quiet in your room? If so music and ambient sounds may help
Is your sleep schedule highly variable? Mine is and messes me up at times
Is your room too light / bright? Blinds or an eye mask may help
Do you switch phones and tablets to night mode? I know the rule about it using them too close to bed, but since that wonâ€™t happen for most of us, night mode can help a bit
Is your room to hot? Can make it tougher to fall asleep
Do you have a consistent sleep schedule? Obviously not and I doubt anyone here does, but supposedly it helps. I will never manage that one

Shooting random ideas basically, but maybe one may help"
tifu,fp2wxfd,t1_fp1p6eq,1588269259.0,"You do realize besides freezing (100% yes), that there is only one solution to your picky eatersâ€™ not eating it: BUY MORE BIRD SEED. 

You currently have a supply and demand issue: WAY over supply and limited demand.

Obviously, in much smaller quantities, but try getting a (small) bag of black oil sunflower seed and mixing it in with the regular seed when you put it on the ground or in the feeder. Do not let your wife buy it, for clear reasons.

My mom has had her feeder for over 50 years and we get anything from woodpeckers to bluebirds and wild canaries. Plus some more normal visitors. Given her and their year round seed addiction, she has occasionally gone for the cheap stuff, which our guys turn their noses up at. 

She adds black oil sunflower seeds in a 1/3 or 1/2 ratio and itâ€™s gone from a 3 container feeder in under 24 hours regardless of base seed. Should solve your supply problem.

For your storage problem, Iâ€™d recommend plastic trash cans with handles and then bungees across the top. The reason for this is rats and mice LOVE bird seed. Besides the bugs in bird seed, the last thing you want is rodent infestation."

BipolarReddit,fp2iwcr,t1_fp0ua60,1588262528.0,"I get that, but just please be careful - Ambien can have worse side effects than it solves. â€˜Normalâ€™ friends have suffered from dark hallucinations, severe nightmares, missed / forgotten time periods where they did weird shit. As we can have some of these symptoms without it, Iâ€™m a little worried about you.

I donâ€™t personally know any bipolar people on it, but I know my doc was very against it for me when I was having sleeping issues, as he said it would potentially be dangerous for me. I know you need to do what you need to do, but please be careful with this one- document any weird symptoms / moods. Keep a close eye on how you are doing.

One other thought - do you snore heavily or have trouble breathing when you sleep? Or do you sleep with someone else who does?  Or have other weird sounds where you sleep?
- snoring / breathing - drug store nose strips and sleeping on your side can help. Sleep study and a cpap machine may help if longer term issue
- the above describes my partner, not me. However, on nightâ€™s I canâ€™t sleep because of him, I find a mix of the more low key ones helps
- for noise, Iâ€™m really sensitive to these particularly when Iâ€™m in the I donâ€™t want to sleep phase. Fans and white noise machines can help.

Anyone who hurts animals, will hurt humans. A baby is vulnerable. Imagine what happens if he loses his temper in the first 6 months? With a loudly crying baby, thatâ€™s 100% possible. What if he canâ€™t control it? Babies are way more annoying than dogs at the beginning. Baby skulls take until 2 years to fuse. One blow and little one is brain damaged for life. Do you want to risk that? Do you want to risk being with someone who avoids his child because he hurt him / her? Thatâ€™s what he is doing with your pets. Why would it be different?

FWIW Iâ€™ve been in an abusive relationship before. I fear for you and your baby, OP. Anyone who hurts an older animal is not to be trusted, Iâ€™m afraid.

declutter,fovhco3,t3_g9t1ue,1588101332.0,"Tl;dr - no easy answers to this one

There are no easy answers to this one, Iâ€™m afraid. My Dad passed 4.5 years ago. I had to move back home then to take care of my mother in the family farm, as she has COPD and a double knee replacement. Like you, Iâ€™m an only. 

My parents are / were closer to hoarders, unfortunately. That makes some things easier to get rid of. Old documents, books without sentimental value, and that kind of thing.

I found that my mom became much more obsessive about keeping things after my Dadâ€™s death unfortunately. Time was helpful here, as sheâ€™s finally starting to allow some things to go. There also appears to be a thing that as people get older, they want to hold onto stuff. As if somehow perceived object permanence is tied to their own permanence / life in this world. 

My mom is obsessed with things finding a good home (e.g., my Dadâ€™s collection of table fountains). Or keeping things that may come in handy. There are several buildings of this due to living on a farm where itâ€™s easy to add a shed here and there. 

In other words, these things can be a full on emotional mess.

My current strategy:
- throw away whatever Iâ€™m allowed to as a category to clear space
- ask at a top level on some categories - e.g., can the beer glass collection go?
- figure out which things are of value - eBay, etc. Iâ€™d consider yard sales if we werenâ€™t in the pandemic, as she is so desperate to ensure this good home thing. Next step is starting to look at collector sites by category
- figure out what can be donated
- constructing arguments why some things must go - she will never use them, no one else will ever use them, they are worthless to everybody, people no longer use formal plates and silver, etc.
- and this is the less good one - throwing out things I know are worthless and would never get used by anyone else (e.g., she is convinced you can you use 20+ year old spices in cooking. Besides lacking in taste, they also could end up degrading in bad ways). We have had a lot of fights on this front, including her going through garbage bags. However, sometimes that is worth it. I try to choose my battles carefully, but find myself giving into frustrated throwing at times. Other times, I strategically time and space the battles to ensure balance.

I am wishing you all the luck, as this situation sucks and is fraught with a lot of sentimental emotion. I also wanted you to know you are not alone. Maybe one of these hints will help. Probably not. But sending you a hug, as I know this isnâ€™t easy."

1) he has a host of these kinds of incidents - eg watering dead plants and almost killing us with black mold from another post. I should have flagged more clearly
2) I just didnâ€™t feel like vomiting out the usual laundry list of bullet pointing all of Kevinâ€™s history of purported Kevinness. â€˜OMG - he tripped a teacher and like was mean to a girl in my class...and he got suspended...and he messed up a lab study. Heâ€™s such a Kevin bro!â€™
3) Iâ€™m surprised you think all Kevins are 100% stupid and that itâ€™s purely IQ-related. I see Kevinity as a spectrum and separate from IQ in some ways. Call it correlation does not equal causation. 

Hypothesis: Kevinity is about doing stupid things, not necessarily about a Kevinâ€™s IQ

So, a few examples of what I mean:
- a person with a really low IQ who has learning disabilities and severe autism - would you laugh at them? I hope not - that would be mean. So not a Kevin
- someone who is below average intelligence, but actually has common sense just not good grades - not a Kevin 
- someone who is below average intelligence and does stupid things - Kevin
- someone who is below average intelligence and always 100% does stupid things - the Kevinly Grail. Unfortunately, Darwin applies here, in terms of natural selection and longevity of the most Kevinacious amongst us
- a person of â€˜normalâ€™ + intelligence who does stupid things or doesnâ€™t know basic stuff - most Kevin stories here are that.
