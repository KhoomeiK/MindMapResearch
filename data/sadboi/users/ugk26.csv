MDMA,ezzwxvg,t1_ezy4v31,1568294092.0,May I ask what drugs you were on when you took the mdma?
SuicideWatch,ezzwiot,t1_ezy1jhi,1568293950.0,"Well I’m bipolar, so In a manic state I decided to start researching them this year. This all started when I was a child. I would watch those guys on home shopping network. They would sell like 200 knives for like 240 bucks lol. So I got into them as a child and said I’d own a collection one day. When I got sick, I just started buying all the shit I ever wanted. Went to Vegas tented a Lamborghini for 3 days. Bought all designer clothes. Was going to buy a Rolex and thankfully they don’t have one anywhere gmt master Batman bezel insert. Now I’m better, not perfect clearly. But my eyes are better. I’m still not happy with my life. I checked some stuff off my bucket list. Half of me loves what I did, half of me hates myself."

SuicideWatch,ezxfkwf,t1_ezwz0if,1568239230.0,"My family sold a business, I had an account with 340k and dipped into it when I shouldn’t have. I also had horrible medical bills because I was diagnosed with a rare eye disease last year. My last two years has been horrible, thinking about killing myself, I thought I would die. So I started buying shit I thought I needed/wanted. Now I regret most of it."
SuicideWatch,ezwxikf,t1_ezwt2kx,1568227331.0,"Yeah I am a custom knife collector. Google Grimsmo Norseman, I own 4 of those. I bought a bunch of custom knives over the last 5 months. Really fucking dumb."
news,ezwl28t,t3_d2l9vk,1568219149.0,Guess it depends on the context.
SuicideWatch,ezwkw9u,t1_ezwhpbw,1568219039.0,"Well I hope you find what you need for relief. I have a rare eye disease, it’s not in my head, but my head was adding to the pain. I didn’t realize it until I started controlling my bipolar. Doesn’t mean I’m not sick, I’m in severe pain. I just deal with it better....and therefore it doesn’t hurt as bad. 

So anyway. I know what it feels like to be in pain and want to kill yourself. You also might have just not found the right doc yet. My only other suggestion would be to go to a research university. They’re doing cutting edge stuff usually and are the most equipped to help. That’s where I get all my eye meds specially compounded. Took 8 doctors for me to get a correct diagnosis and treatment plan. Good luck."
news,ezwehju,t1_ezw2isu,1568214797.0,Calling depression selfish means you’re putting an expectation on that person imho. An expectation that they should account for other people feelings. They can barely account for their own. Who’s the selfish one I ask?
SuicideWatch,ezwb01e,t1_ezw6i29,1568212444.0,"I just blew 130k on knives, clothes, weed and vacations...maybe that’ll make you feel like less of a scumbag. Mine was a giant fuck up, I hate myself."
SuicideWatch,ezwap1b,t1_ezvpnnz,1568212230.0,"Please take this with a grain of salt from someone who’s bipolar. You suffer from ptsd and possibly a mental illness from all your trauma. It’s hard to believe, but my body generates pain. I think about old events, I feel literal physical pain. Your headaches could be stress. I know that sounds fucking insane, but it’s possible, maybe even probable given the fact no one can find anything wrong and you don’t respond to meds. 

So what’s the solution. You may need to see a psychiatrist and get on mood stabilizers. Again, it’s not just mental, if you have a chemical imbalance, your neurotransmitters are fucked up.  When that happens, your own brain can cause its own damage due to producing the wrong neurotransmitters in the wrong amounts. It would be akin to taking drugs that throw off your chemicals. So look at taking meds as a way to fix a physical problem...that’s IF mood disorder is even causing this. I only brought it up because of your trauna and you sound desperate, why not try the psych meds?"
optometry,ezpcema,t3_c6hzkx,1568037846.0,"First there is hope for you. I thought I was hopeless, same symptoms as you. You may not have grand dropout as bad as you think. I only say that because I had 8 doctors over a year each diagnose me wrong, until I found doctor number 9. He diagnosed me and put me on the protocol that gave me my life back. 

What works for me, I have floppy eyelid syndrome.

Topical preservative free methyl prednisolone, this is s steroid. But I needed a year of steroids, 3 weeks is undertreating your issue. 

Doxycycline, if you have gland issues you need to be on 200mg doxy immediately to help keep your glands and oils healthy. 

Bridget compress, mastering this is key, too hot, you dry your eyes words. Too cool, you don’t complete the treatment. 

Serum tears, these really helped heal the cornea and get rid of that gritty feeling

Heparin, specific to my disease

Avenova spray, it’s expensive and you cannot substitute. But you can get it on amazon. Wipe lids twice a day w this after a month the burning will start to go away. 

Cosopt PF, I have glaucoma also 

IVIG, expensive experimental drug that’s really working. You can only get it at my hospital because they run the clinical trials. 350 a month but I get my eyes back. 

This is expensive...600 a month, but I wanted to kill myself so it’s worth every penny."
OpiatesRecovery,ezo9mg1,t3_d0okeu,1568018874.0,"I personally need thc also. If I take thc and cbd edibles, I can lower my opiates 30% with ZERO withdrawal. If you have never taken thc, be very careful and start very very low, less than 5mg. But this will rock your withdrawals something sexy."
OpiatesRecovery,ezo906n,t3_d1mlc5,1568018585.0,"I’m on here searching for help also. But if this gives you some hope let me put it out there. 

I have tapered over 5 months from 120mg oxy and 60mg vicodin to 55mg vicodin only. It was a HARD road and I’m actually a lot better now. Just trying to find some help tapering off this last few pills. But it’s possible. 

Personally, I transferred from oxy to vicodin and that’s how I did it. I would replace oxy with vicodin and then start cutting the vikes after I stabilized and did that over and over again. I’m not advocating you go to heroin or oxy from the subs. But you need to find a way to taper. I’d get a .001mg scale and weigh your doses and just cut little by little. 

Good luck"

opiates,ezgxmfa,t1_ezgvcia,1567902832.0,"So essentially continue the taper just push harder/faster. I can do that, it was my next choice anyway. Alright, I’ll drop the second dose to 15 and stabilize. Then rinse and repeat. 

If I can get down to 5mg 4x a day, I think the final portion will actually be easy. Assuming I go slowly. Thanks for talking it out. Any ad ice is welcome. I want to cut more I just wish I could know how I would feel, lol. Literally impossible"
opiates,ezguu5y,t1_ezgu756,1567901773.0,"Four doses, 15mg/20mg/10mg/10mg spaced evenly. The larger doses up front replaced the oxy, that’s why it’s unbalanced but I’m stable most of the day now. The depressions still killing me however.  Thank you for the response."
