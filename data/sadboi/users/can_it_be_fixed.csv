Still, it was all worth it and I'm lucky I got out even if it wasn't my idea. She was no good for me. I had my doubts about her in the past but always shook it off as paranoia.

BipolarReddit,f8fyo3m,t1_f8fxpts,1574551344.0,"Oh shit. Yeah, I can see how that might've been a good wake up call for me more times than I can count. No one's ever done that for me. I usually just get yelled at during my suicide threats or self-harming bevavior and told I'm being abusive. I've now fixed it by being single and keeping up with therapy and meds.

Weird how calling 911 can be a very severe act of kindness."
BipolarReddit,f8fwlfk,t1_f8fncje,1574550517.0,"^ I agree strongly with your advice. I even think that the damage that a 911 wellness check may cause is worth it considering that all these intense and stressful phone calls might actually be enabling the daughter to behave this way.

I went through lots of big fights with my ex, but never brought my parents into the mix, save for one time where I needed a voice of reason when I was considering leaving due to her emotionally abusive behavior. I'm the one with bipolar disorder, but she had her own problematic stuff going on, too."
NoFap,f8eiady,t1_f8egr8y,1574528176.0,"This is an important aspect of nofap. What is the benefit of never allowing yourself any form of sexual pleasure again, especially once P isn't part of your life anymore? 

Is there a length of time that becomes mentally and/or physically unhealthy?"
bipolar,f8cdwof,t1_f8c8yey,1574458196.0,"I don't usually feel bad about not making anything for so long. I graduated in 06 and have barely made anything since then and nothing's felt good about until my wife left me. I also didn't work for much of that time, so you've got something going on and I hope you let yourself feel the accomplishment of stable employment.

I'm trying to paint right now and it's a disaster, but I thought it would be, so in a way I'm right on track ;)"
bipolar,f8boqnb,t3_dzxwl8,1574441824.0,"Hmm, well to me the silver lining is that you won't suffer the trauma of laughing while having an orgasm."
BipolarReddit,f8bocrh,t1_f8agmkx,1574441573.0,"That's what subs and mods are for. Otherwise every forum could transform into whoever posted the most often, rather than those who stay on topic or at least trying to understand the group's purpose. I'd quickly lose interest if r/bipolar was full of questions about why we don't try to get better.

I think I see the point you're trying to make, though. I know one random troll won't generally affect my day at all, but what if someone's doing especially bad and they see that. Yes they're being fragile, but that's sort of the point here and that one stupid troll could drive a person to self-harm instead of getting useful advice in a relevant community."
NoFap,f8bmzq7,t1_f8blgaf,1574440673.0,"Sorry to say I'm 6 years older than the last person. 

I wish I'd discovered nofap 21 years ago, but the internet wasn't ready back then. Porn was actually really challenging to view back then. The image would start at the top and download at a snail's pace. Like several minutes to even see cleavage slow. And the image quality was laughable. Is that pixel a boob or a shoulder? No idea, couldn't tell. I'd often give up and just check out the underwear models in the Sears catalogue instead."
BipolarReddit,f89ocwm,t3_dzpgpx,1574376602.0,"I really did like the movie a lot but I don't see it as a portrayal of bipolar disorder or even mental illness really. 

I see it more as the inner narrative of a badly damaged misanthrope who got even worse as time went on. The story was engaging and I loved the acting, sets and camera work."
4Runner_1stGen,f89nfub,t3_dzj1iv,1574376140.0,Looks like a really good day to me. Hope you give the undercarriage a wash afterwards.
BipolarReddit,f89n9cl,t1_f89i9pi,1574376051.0,"Sounds like we were on a similar journey, but I still drank too often right up until I quit. It was just notably less than my friends drank at the time. I passed the 6 month sober mark on Nov 13th and it felt like any other day. I'm just so glad I did this for myself."
bipolar,f865dnq,t1_f85mgsp,1574290115.0,"Thank you for your insight. The meaning is actually something like that to me, although I don't think of myself as the pyramid.

You're free to give any opinions you might have about it. I'm just throwing my first drawings out into the world here, which might not be the best idea but I've been living inside my head for too long."

bipolar,f862orw,t1_f861es2,1574288524.0,"I sort of invented it as the drawing progressed, but I've been thinking about the shape for awhile. It's a tetrahedron-based form of tesseract, the conceptual 3D model of a 4th dimensional shape (usually rendered as a cube within a cube). 

I'm drawn to pyramids for many reasons. They're strong visual shapes (it's the only platonic solid with the majority of it's mass at the bottom) and I was raised with Judaism so learned very early on about the historical significance of the Egyptian pyramids.

The center tetrahedron is ""bleeding"" or weeping into a puddle because we can't perceive it in our 3D understanding of reality. My ex-wife is holding a miniature version of it as a symbol that I gave away too much control of my life and she ended up hurting me very badly as a result. I plan on expanding the concept for awhile and seeing where it goes."
bipolar,f861ia1,t1_f85tgln,1574287841.0,"No, thank you for your creative input! 

My roommates are artists as well, but I feel that increasing the range of feedback I get on these first drawings, the sooner I'll be making really strong work."
bipolar,f85q36g,t1_f85p9p4,1574280594.0,"The figure or the entire image?

The figure is my memory of my ex-wife. I don't keep contact with her anymore, but she's often nearby in my thoughts."
bipolar,f85pmms,t1_f85oeq5,1574280311.0,"Thank you. I have a bfa from uarts in Philly, but haven't done anything with it aside from finally pay the loans off, lol.

Are you currently a student?"
