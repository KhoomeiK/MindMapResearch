It's meant to stay a secret.

As for both of their memories being erased, same thing. To each other, they ARE just everyone else. They shouldn't be aware of each other's true existence, otherwise, the experiment ends.

Experiments are delicate things. They require strict stipulations and criteria. If they aren't met, the experiment is automatically declared a failure and terminated. I work in animal research. I know."
