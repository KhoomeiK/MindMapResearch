Not sure if Iâ€™ve ever done an enzyme test. Like 20 plus years. Off and on first five years. Iâ€™ve been with this Dr 14 years. I trust him and he tells me Iâ€™m too honest.  Iâ€™ve been running out a little early  and with drawling for three days! I was getting discouraged.  Iâ€™m stubborn hard headed and listen when you think I donâ€™t! Iâ€™ve seen your post and see you earn old goat! I have a post about something broke I would appreciate it I could pick your brain.

ChronicPain,fq0wqml,t1_fq0t1f6,1589038605.0,"I think I tried sending to fast?!? I always got relief from my injections but the length of relief was shorter . When that happens theyâ€™ll go bi-lateral (both side) everyone is different! Iâ€™m new to this site and Iâ€™m making it mad I think!ðŸ¤ªsorry

Did that help?"
ChronicPain,fq0v13l,t3_ggfenb,1589038000.0,I always got some relief. I remember the first time was the best and fell off from there but since I originally had relief it qualified me for another set of injections that worked way better!

philosophy,fpy6wi5,t1_fpp9h9a,1588997327.0,You are right it would be difficult but when it happens! You have zero regret or quilt. Quilt makes grieving last a lifetime. Without ever moving on! You would treat everyone a little better it would lengthen your patience! Stress levels would be lower. Iâ€™ve never heard this before sorry! I got on Reddit for my back pain and opiate  addiction. This help me better than the last two days! Thanks
ChronicPain,fpxt1cs,t1_fptby9p,1588988984.0,Nice! Not sure if your familiar with the movie Rosewood. Ving Rhames. Good movie sad but good! Iâ€™m trying to find that strength and knowledge in my journey! Just to much noise

ChronicPain,fpxaual,t3_g7omua,1588979023.0,"My first one too! Brother I messed my back up in my mid 20â€™s welding pipe. Laid out a couple weeks just couldnâ€™t handle it. Had a two year old son. I gotta work! I jumped on the pain management train. If it was available I tried it except surgery I didnâ€™t want surgery! 20 years later still welding pipe. Had back surgery 2018 lower lumbar fusion all of them. Not working right now but waiting on a phone call. Only real issue I have had was after surgery bout a month! I had pills left over. Went to my follow up, adjust my pain medicine.  Maybe 2 days after. Told my wife I think I have the flu. Weird time of year. 3 days 5 days 12 days! I ainâ€™t ever been this sick. So sick I wasnâ€™t worried about my back pain! Told my wife letâ€™s go to the ER. She said Iâ€™ve been on the internet! I thought oh shoot! She said try this and gave me a pain pill! 30 minutes later. We were screaming at each other! She called me addicted I flew through the roof! I felt 100% better! Find a Dr you can trust find a pain management that you trust and move on from there! Just remember Respect your medication! Over too much time itâ€™s gonna jerk a knot in your ass! Iâ€™ll pray for ya! Sorry your going thru this! One day at a time!  Everybody is different on what works best for them! Mine is oxycontin"
