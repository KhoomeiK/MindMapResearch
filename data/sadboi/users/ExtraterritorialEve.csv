Size is 38F I believe, UK size. From Sainsbury‚Äôs clothing brand TU. 

The band was like this when it arrived, so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs been caused by the way I wash/dry/dear/store it. But I wash on a delicates wash, air dry, and I guess I just store in folded in half on a shelf. 

It‚Äôs too physically uncomfortable to wear for long because of the band curling inwards :( I‚Äôll have a look for liner you suggested.

aspergers,ffml2vx,t1_ffmj1g8,1580056152.0,"Just from my experience, ASD comes with sensory issues that I wouldn‚Äôt expect to come with bpd. 
Bpd tends to come with extreme thought patterns, maybe something like ‚Äúshe hasn‚Äôt responded to my text, she hates me‚Äù for example. Generally a rather unstable relationship with people, very hot and cold, like bestest friends ever and then suddenly you hate them. I wouldn‚Äôt expect to see this in ASD, maybe a similar pattern, like black and white thinking and trouble maintaining or making relationships. 

Hmm.. the dramatic mood swings that come with bpd, I think this is difficult because in autism, you can get what looks like mood swings from the outside, in reality it‚Äôs a shutdown or a meltdown from too much stress and stimuli. In bpd the mood swings are often triggered by small things, maybe like someone not answering the phone?

Bpd comes on in later life and is the result of trauma or a turbulent upbringing. Whereas ASD symptoms are often present as a very young child. But it‚Äôs still common to be diagnosed later in life with ASD because symptoms aren‚Äôt obvious and the social aspect may only become an issue later in life (especially common in women for example). 

I think it‚Äôs really interesting to learn about the differences between the two, because many like myself are misdiagnosed with bpd before learning that they‚Äôre actually autistic.

They should be able to direct you on a path for a correct diagnosis of one or the other. 

There‚Äôs a few things that I‚Äôd say mark a difference between them? If that‚Äôd help to know? Or I can find a website that can explain it better for you"
aspergers,ffm6u9q,t3_eu6jg4,1580049526.0,"Aspergers/autism isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúlate onset‚Äù condition, you have it from birth. Unless you mean you didn‚Äôt have obvious symptoms until you were older?

Afaik autism/aspergers can often be confused with borderline personality disorder.  Source: the numerous psychologists and psychiatrists I‚Äôve seen in the last 2 years that misdiagnosed me, undiagnosed me and then finally correctly diagnosed me lmao. 

Not saying you have bpd. Just confused by what you mean by late onset"

Edit: Can anyone explain what a munchie is please

Fibromyalgia,fevp1sz,t1_fevjtdl,1579399848.0,"Ahaha, do whatever it takes to get you through the days. F**k what anyone says about your methods of that‚Äôs what you need"
Fibromyalgia,fevj1ja,t1_fevhh3o,1579397997.0,Yeah i mean you‚Äôre meant to get over the addiction/withdrawal phase first. Stick it out for a few months and see if you feel better. For me I did not üòÇ
Fibromyalgia,feu5zkn,t1_feu555c,1579383405.0,"Hmm well everyone around me was worried about how many big cans of energy drink I was chubby 24/7 and I couldn‚Äôt afford the daily cost of ¬£5-10 anymore. 
They were the only things that kept me going through the working day despite sleeping so much at night. But I lost my job and my flat and so had to move out of London, seemed a good time to try quiting. What if they were the cause of me feeling so crap? Or what if they were making me feel more crap?

Spoilers I feel worse now than I ever have before ahaha"
Fibromyalgia,feu2uu6,t1_fesllgn,1579382611.0,"I was so addicted to energy drinks and omg red Bull tastes soooo goood. I feel so much worse since quiting energy drinks 12 months ago, than I did when I would drink 4 - 6 cans a day."
ChronicPain,femuux5,t3_eprtx5,1579270221.0,"I mean, I‚Äôm no doctor, so this is just an anecdotal suggestion. My friend had severe back pain in one spot for two odd years before the doctor realised she had a trapped nerve. Visited a physical therapist who gave some exercises and it released the nerve, she‚Äôs doing much better now. 

Sounds like a really dismissive diagnosis, but if it fixes it, that‚Äôs great. And pain is pain, no matter the cause. I hope you find the answers and the right treatment to fix it if possible or at least maximise your quality of life :)"
ChronicPain,feg6ith,t1_feg1wmb,1579079289.0,"Cool, as I said, rule everything else out before diagnoses like fibro can be diagnosed. Because that‚Äôs literally what fibro is, pain unexplainable by other conditions. That was the point I was trying to get across, not scaremongering. 

And as I put in my comment, I‚Äôm not a doctor."
ChronicPain,feg6byb,t1_fefs2sx,1579079020.0,"Ah we don‚Äôt get those in the UK, but I‚Äôd heard a lot of talk recently about people a fibro test. Lmao my bad! Thank you for explaining :)"

ChronicPain,fefbh9u,t1_fefb6ma,1579052658.0,"That sucks dude. Heat packs are my best friend for pain, I can never have enough heat packs. some people prefer ice packs though, maybe either of those might help. 

But yeah, definitely check with some other sources on that at-home-test, because afaik, there‚Äôs no legitimate test. Good luck"
ChronicPain,fef9w9y,t3_eouvaz,1579051615.0,"Yo dude don‚Äôt bother with that test. It‚Äôs a scam and is very very unlikely to prove anything, there‚Äôs no biological marker for fibromyalgia. Fibro is a disease diagnosed only by ruling out every other alternative explanation for the pain and other symptoms. 

Highly suggest a second opinion, check out r/fibromyalgia

Edit to add, if your pin is just pelvic, then it‚Äôs probably not fibro, more likely to be chronic regional pain syndrome IF they can‚Äôt find any other cause. Something like endometriosis can only be diagnosed with surgery to check (I believe). 

Also full disclosure (obvs) I‚Äôm not a doctor

Edit again cause this is top of this chain of comments: someone pointed out CRPS is rarely associated with pelvic pain. So, yeah. Just pelvic pain is highly unlikely to be fibro or CRPS."
Fibromyalgia,fef4aaf,t3_eoe5n0,1579047838.0,"Honestly for me, after the pain then fatigue, my memory issues are super duper annoying and upsetting and really bad. 

I didn‚Äôt realise how bad my memory was until moving in with my boyfriend, he got frustrated that I asked him if he was ok, because as it turns out, I‚Äôd ask him 6 times in an hour. I completely forget asking him things or telling him something, so I apparently repeat myself a lot. 

Beyond that, I lose everything I touch, I can‚Äôt manage basic things with household tasks, like TURNING THE GOD DAMNED OVER OFF!!! I‚Äôm a walking hazard with my terrible memory. But I‚Äôve been dismissed by several doctors about my worries"
Fibromyalgia,fec1r0c,t3_eo8kvt,1578965388.0,"Widespread unexplainable pain is the key symptom of fibromyalgia. If you‚Äôre having the fibro symptoms without the pain, it may be chronic fatigue syndrome which looks very very similar but with fatigue issues being a bigger problem than the pain (if there‚Äôs pain at all). So it may be worth looking into chronic fatigue syndrome. 

If you don‚Äôt suffer with constant/very regular, extreme fatigue, then there‚Äôs likely another cause of your symptoms. You do not want a diagnosis of chronic fatigue or fibromyalgia as they‚Äôre basically dead end diagnoses, that mean doctors couldn‚Äôt find a cause of the symptoms. 

Often things like vitamins deficiencies can give the symptoms of fibro/cfs, so definitely go to your docs and make sure you get blood work done and such. They should do all the necessary tests to rule everything out. 

In the mean time, this sub and the cfs sub are great for finding resources and tips about coping with your symptoms, but ultimately your doc will be the best guide. Don‚Äôt want to do something that may make things worse, if you don‚Äôt know the cause of the symptoms. 

My docs noticed I had a vitamin D deficiency, and an iron deficiency. These can both often cause similar symptoms, as can low blood pressure (dizziness and POTs like symptoms). That‚Äôs about as far as my knowledge goes I think..

Good luck, I hope you find answers and a good treatment for things, we‚Äôre all here"
