Being 10 or 11 at the time, I limited myself to PEMDAS and threw in summations, factorials, and a square root or two.

   
 

Here you go, I dragged out the old notepad file. You can chastise 11 year old me if any of the equations are incorrect. I never went back to double check them. And some of them, looking now, are quite unnecessarily complex but they were an easy way to build on a previous solution.
