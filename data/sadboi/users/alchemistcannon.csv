AmItheButtface,fko1ri6,t1_fknopjd,1584378414.0,"I mean, were you using her? From your post it seems like you two liked each other, tried to turn a platonic friendship into a romantic relationship, and it didn't work out. Most relationships when you're in your late teens early 20s don't last too long. You're both trying to figure out your lives and it worked for a bit, but now you need different things. You said you'd still like to keep the friendship going, but from how you're saying she's acting I wouldn't. 

>She even told me she tried to kill herself three days ago.

See, now that's manipulative. She wants you to get back together with her. Her personal and psychological problems are not yours to bare, especially after only 4 months of a true relationship. If anything, seriously encourage her to seek a therapist. Someone to talk to professionally about what mental gymnastics she's dealing with. She's trying to blame you and not reflect inwardly on how to better herself."
AmItheButtface,fknnn91,t3_fjljol,1584369972.0,"NBH. It sucks to break up a relationship when you thought things were fine. But it didn't even last half a year and almost everyone in their first few weeks of a loving relationship makes ""promises"" like I won't leave. Things change, feelings change as the relationship settles, and sometimes the person you thought was great for you isn't. Plus, you guys are so young still. I will admit you should've brought up your feelings sooner, but you shouldn't feel guilty because of how she's reacting. 

From what you said about her posting a crying video, that sounds like she really wants attention from people to feel better. I don't think she's doing it to get back at you or make people hate you, I just think she's incredibly sad about losing a loving relationship. TIME WILL HEAL THIS. She'll eventually move on and even if she doesn't that's not your burden to bare. I wish you luck my dude"

Not calling for a purge or apocalypse, just stating that the Earth can't take care of us for long if we don't do something.
