depression,fopufjx,t3_g8eq07,1587972491.0,"I can only relate to this post and OP by saying that I lost someone I loved dearly as well. Someone I could talk too and relate too. One day, she went to a bar, she most likely got drunk, she apparently met someone at the bar according to ""Witnesses"" there. And on top of that she wasn't answering her phone for hours upon hours. We shrugged it off as her either being asleep or too drunk to answer the phone, so we too went to sleep and we hadn't heard from her for a couple of days. We decided to check up on her when again she didn't answer the phone. We started getting worried so we called her immediate family members that we could get a hold of. After several hours have passed we decided to call the police and file a missing persons case. There was a county-wide search for her, but to no avail. I lost hope and cried for days, I still have some of our pictures together and some notes we would pass to each other in class. We were best friends in and out of school and she went missing at age 24. I'm 42 now."

It's your decision on whether or not you want to forgive her. We haven't experienced what you have with her, we don't personally know you. If you want my advice then I'd say confront her about it, [use this](https://time.com/5443204/signs-lying-body-language-experts/) to see if you can tell if she's being genuine, and YOU decide if you want to be with her or not. Nobody likes a sad ending, but it'll be what it will."
