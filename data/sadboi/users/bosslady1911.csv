I'm in my 30s, but what I've figured out works for me (and what I have in my current job):  
\- A manager and team that I feel comfortable connecting to personally - my boss is very aware of my mental health struggles and is nothing but supportive.

\- Little to no travel. I get stressed about traveling for fun - and traveling for work is extremely triggering and draining for me. 

\- The ability to work at home. I work at home almost 100% of the time (even before COVID), but I also make sure to have connections at the local office. I typically would go into the office 2-3 times a month. My whole team is virtual, so it's just a social/networking opportunity to go into my local office.

\- Having a certain level of visibility - not too much, not too little - as well as a manager who can be a buffer between you and the corporate politics.

\- Flexibility and work-life balance. 

\- Not being responsible for saving lives. Ha."
