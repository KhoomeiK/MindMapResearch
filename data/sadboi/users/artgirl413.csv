Christianmarriage,fqi9fbf,t1_fqi4qhw,1589392793.0,"That last part is really helpful, and I think right now it is our main source of conflict when we do have it, and something we are working on. We take accountability seriously, and while I think it is important to do things in community, I feel sometimes that he is really quick to share things that we have not fully processed together and take others advice before fleshing it out between us. There is a pastor friend that we have who he has been very, very good friends with for a long time. I am actually interning under said pastor. But honestly, as much as I think this pastor is a good friend to my boyfriend, as a pastor I think his ability to give good advice is lacking. I do not mean to slight him, but in different times we have come to this man for help or wisdom, he‚Äôs just given really awful, hurtful advice. Other pastors and staff in the church have also recognized this. And because he has been a really good, supportive friend to my boyfriend, my boyfriend kind of just takes his word as law and whatever he suggests, my boyfriend 100% believes and gets behind. That may have worked for their relationship before, but like this is not just those two anymore. It‚Äôs also my relationship with my boyfriend. And as I stated, I am absolutely open to constructive criticism and wisdom it‚Äôs just that this guy.... is really not helpful and can be condemning in ways that are absolutely uncalled for. So any advice in this area would be helpful. I love my church congregation and I am a kids min leader and I adore my kiddos so I do not want to change churches, and I think this pastor is really well meaning and is an amazing pastor for other people and other ways in our community, it‚Äôs just that this is a sore spot."
