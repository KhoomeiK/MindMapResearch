bipolartype2,f6hcrnq,t3_dhwulx,1572843274.0,"In my experience, I think psychiatrists don't really take the time to treat each patient as a distinct individual. I'm sorry I can't give you more insight, as I am also wondering if I have type 2 bipolar or cyclothymia. I encourage you to ask lots and LOTS of questions each time you see your doc."

mentalhealth,ew00te7,t1_evxebjf,1564972521.0,"I'm proud of you for recognizing this, and I also saw your comment about wanting to propose. I think what you should do at this point is have a conversation with her about what you're feeling and experiencing. Be as open as possible. If she really loves you, it won't matter."
mentalhealth,evxj8g6,t1_evxfejc,1564894354.0,Tbh this is a valid concern.
mentalhealth,evxe658,t3_clrs7b,1564889620.0,"I'm so sorry. This is the part of taking meds that is really rough...either you find something that WORKS but has side effects like no sex drive, or you're not having undesireable side effects while suffering. How long has it been since you switched?"
CasualConversation,evxdwjh,t3_c3b8gj,1564889394.0,"I'm sorry if this is against the rules (commenting on old posts) but I wanted to write about something similar. 

I've started using reddit regularly over the past couple weeks and I feel less inclined to check Facebook and stuff.

I have grappled with the concept of FOMO and wondered if it was just my mental illness that made it feel worse than it was, but that was until I saw people without mental illness struggle with it pretty seriously, to the point where it caused disruption in their lives."
r4r,evnvjvm,t3_ckdzn2,1564633165.0,"I really try to avoid downvoting unless it's something really, really egregious.

depression,eve9y00,t1_evc5rpn,1564460049.0,I can relate to feeling like you're getting dumber. I don't think anyone dislikes you though. I know \*I\* like you because you took the time to reply to this post!
