The Australian Government has a really good moduled resource on how to deal with your health anxiety and how to deal with the relationship between you and the symptoms have or you think you have. Work through each module and let me know if this helped :)"
Anxiety,flbbmev,t3_fnp6oh,1585001333.0,"Whenever I have breathing-related issues due to panic I always put my hands on the back of my head, this opens up your diaphragm allowing you to fully fill your lungs with air. Then just breathe at a medium pace, in through the nose, and out through the mouth. :) I hope this helps."
Anxiety,fla09u6,t3_fnj2eh,1584973738.0,"Hey man, 

I know exactly how you feel, stay informed but don't make yourself crazy, limit your news intake, we were not designed to know exactly what's going on in every country in every moment of the day. it's no benefit to you and only adds to your anxiety. You need to remember how many times you probably cough/clear year throat/swallow a day before all this happened but you never actually notice because you didn't have a reason to. All you can do is stay away from people, live your healthiest lifestyle possible and keep clean.  


A good way to think about all this is the Buddist way; a normal person thinks 'panic! panic! it's out of your control!!' where the Monk thinks 'relax... it's out of your control' :)  


The Australian government has the best resources I've found so far on dealing with health anxiety and how to manage your relationship with your 'symptoms'. It's easily broken down into modules so gives one module a read each night and see how you feel afterwards

Anxiety,fks5gch,t3_fkayil,1584482673.0,"Oh my god Yes! This whole thing has got me having a really unusual relationship with my health anxiety. I developed Hypochondria a couple of years ago and have had my ups and downs with it, bar a few panic attacks, I've managed to live with it since.   


But since the news spread about the Virus spreading, I found somedays it actually HELPED me and my health anxiety, by framing me in the world and putting things into perspective. It helped me realize how healthy I actually am (M26 and pretty in shape) and all these little sensations and aches I used to panic about at night suddenly don't seem so bad.   


Still a couple of times a day I do still get anxious and shortness of breath appears just like you said, making me panic about having covid19 in my system. However, for me it's just about MANAGING the RELATIONSHIP I have with the SYMPTOMS I may or may not have."
