stimuluscheck,fpd999e,t3_gcs5cq,1588522439.0,Yes once the payment is rejected from the old account they sent the paper check. They've messed up so many times and there's noone to talk to. Took 3 weeks to get the check not sure how long for you overseas üò£

unpopularopinion,fp8l8qh,t3_gbnwhz,1588395301.0,Sometimes I take pics of me when I'm crying definitely not to share or post but to see how fucking ugly or stupid I look. It gives me motivation to get up and shake off whatever dumb thing that has me so weak and I'll wash my face and put make up on if needed so my kids don't see me like that.
Anxiety,fp875ks,t3_gbnjuv,1588385231.0,Yes got a call this morning telling me I'm back in the office starting Monday. At least I'll be in my own office. BUT  I've been gone 6 weeks already more notice would be nice. I know I haven't been giving 100% it's hard to focus and lots of drama at home. This could be good. Or it could be bad.

Anxiety,fokjk82,t3_g7nta9,1587843254.0,"Today I got a ""oh boohoo"" it's all in your head. This post could not be more accurate. Everything I'm feeling right now! I went to the grocery store a few times since quarentine and have been fortunate to avoid mass crowds until I irresponsibly went to the grocery store the day before Easter which was a Saturday it was packed and other shoppers walking in your space that should have been observing social distancing notices throughout the store. I started getting lightheaded and bolted toward an empty isle so I could hyperventilate in private. I started sweating and thinking to myself I wish I had someone to come save me! But I know that wouldn't be the case so I hurried and made a run for the check out line. I was burning up still and shaking barely able to drive but I had somewhere I needed to be. I wish i could wallow in self pitty in the car until I calm down but I've been living with it and dealing with it on my own so long that I just start freaking out in the car but carry on. Some days are harder than others but I figure there are other mental illnesses that could be worse than severe anxiety right?! I tell myself that and helps me get through the day and makes me feel stronger that I don't need someone to come save me I'll get myself out of it eventually. Hang in there ya'll. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

Anxietyhelp,fojnzpt,t3_g5ilgy,1587825628.0,"7. Falls in line with  9. I've tried to communicate my expectations but I'm cut off so I can never get a full sentence out which makes me frustrated on top of anxious which leads to me ""making excuses"" which it's not always an excuse everyone's feelings are valid. Would be nice if you could finish one damn sentence and even if they disagree a simple I hear you would be nice. But that doesn't happen so I start back at 1. Everyday. It's exhausting."

I'm crazy though I have face masks and peels, noxzema pads, acne medicine for the day after , and medicated acne wash for the shower. I'm a popper so I traded it in for skin care to fight the urges. I also floss and brush my teeth often. I sleep with the exception of last week I stayed up too long lol and i eat! Take care of yourselves if your gonna make stupid choices like smoking meth. Eeeek"

Get a lamp keep it on I'm the corner and play some mellow music or light hip hop on a Bluetooth not too loud but it will help you if you think they can hear your music over your torch and noone thinks twice about a lamp on.
meth,fnu3zo1,t3_g3xj4n,1587254092.0,"Stayed up 5 days luckily no hallucinating only saw some wall paper on my white walls double vision and everything looked like it was drenched in white powder as if my BF rolled around in a tub of coke and threw everything we owned it it to. Can't say I want to experience that again. Today was the first day I slept, woke up took vitamins, had Gatorade, and eating dinner now. I won't be tweaking again anytime soon."
