Do you not see the hypocrisy? I'm not going to argue with you anymore because you clearly can't keep up. You are unable to hold an intellectual conversation. The terms males and females are not used at the same rates in our society. That is general knowledge. I've never heard anyone refer to men as males. Also if you have to resort to name-calling, you have no point. It just makes you look bad, not me.

Are you suggesting that women should just suck it up and have sex when they do not want to so their husbands don’t leave them?

Marriages are more than just sex. Leaving your wife and family because your wife doesn’t want to have sex with you every time you request it is just a ridiculous suggestion for you to even make.

Say he did leave his wife, then what? By the time he’s divorced, he will be almost 40. It could take several years for him to find another partner. He may never find one that he loves as much as his current wife, who mothered his children. And let’s just say he does find a new wife and they have a great sex life. How could he be sure that his new wife wouldn’t lose her sex drive after marriage? So he could now be with a new wife that he may not love as much as his first wife who doesn’t want to have sex with him, and he only gets to see his kids every other weekend? Besides, he may lose his sex drive within the period of time it took him to get a divorce and find another wife.

This would cause even more issues with your sex life with your wife. Also, if you are in an open relationship, she will likely want to have sex with another partner. If this were to happen, don't let it make you insecure. That happens a lot and has nothing to do with your performance, her attraction to you, or how much she loves you. Sometimes it's fun to try something new. Just know that once open it's a hard door to close."

And if someone is constantly asking you to do something, it can be really annoying, and it makes it feel like work instead of an enjoyable experience. 

You want it to be her idea. Maybe try a new approach. Go out of your way for her outside of the bedroom. Make her feel comfortable. Take some pressure off her. In the bedroom, make it all about her. Pleasure her first. Try massages. Make out like you are teenagers. Seriously, women will be very generous if you make them feel special, beautiful, and loved. If none of those things work, then maybe you just aren't sexually compatible and you should decide what you want to do about it. But I wouldn't throw away a marriage because she made a comment that made you uncomfortable when she was likely uncomfortable. People say things that they don't mean all the time."

It kind of just feels like I’m having a hard time, but how do I know if I’m having mood symptoms when my behavior is less than ideal or this is just who I am? Maybe, I’m just a jerk. Maybe, I’m just not thinking before I’m acting. A lot symptoms related to mood can be personality traits of someone who isn’t bipolar.

""It doesn't bother me so long as they don't bitch about it."" You are arguing about it on Reddit unprovoked. You clearly have some strong opinions about how other people are spending their money, what little money they have. 

You can't even prove your own point, or make one. So it makes sense that you would latch onto my last paragraph that was a hypothetical comment of a scenario in which a person may decide to treat themselves. No one deserves a piece? They earned their money and are choosing to buy something that they want. It isn't your money. Why would you care, and are so daft to not understand that more that one thing can be true. You can be poor and treat yourself to a small item while being a victim of an economy that does not provide you with a reasonable income to live based on your labor. 

Clearly, you do not understand how our system works against lower income people. Look at my previous reply for insight. These are not just small segments of the lower class population. That is the reality that they live in. Our economy is rigged in a way that people who already have money have opportunities to save and earn money in other ways than employment that are not afforded to people who do not have money. So yes, I do believe and there are many examples of ways in which lower class people are unable to reach a middle class status. Sure, some get lucky, but those are exceptions to the rule."

You wouldn't have disposable income that would enable you to live above your means, you are poor. That is what it means to be poor. Nobody to blame, but yourself? I think there are a lot of people to blame. But that is another conversation.

Most people cannot live on $20,000 per year. The average 1 bedroom apartment in the US is over $1,200 per month. So unless you are living with your parents, how would you pay your rent? 

""If you're 25 and have 3 kids"" How many people fit into this category? This isn't a very good example because it is overly specific and not a good reflection of most people's circumstances. It does not make a point. It indicates that you do not have a point. A very large proportion of pregnancies are unplanned, so that is hardly a ""poor financial choice."" And I wouldn't exactly refer to having children as a financial choice. Everyone has the right to have children if they so choose, and that's not really any of your business. 

The thing is most people do not have the money to save, not because they are spending it on unnecessary items, but because they are not earning a living wage. Or their living expenses are more than their salary because of certain circumstances that have nothing to do with spending habits. 

But anyway, so what if they are a person who does live paycheck to paycheck and decides to buy the new iphone? Does that really bother you? Are they not allowed to own a small luxury that so many others can easily afford because they are poor? Seriously, they just want a small piece of a pie that you are eating on the daily. Get over it. And they have every right to complain about being dealt a shitty hand that continues to fuck them over every single day. They are just trying to get by, and you don't think they deserve a small distraction? I can assure you that not buying that iphone or not buying a cup of coffee a couple times a week wouldn't have changed their life and definitely wouldn't have amounted to enough to cover months without an income.

Is it also probable that if they are lower income that they also have bad credit and were only able to pay for the car through a predatory loan that will end up costing them twice the amount that someone with cash would pay? And how likely is it that the piece of shit car that they are paying twice as much for because they are poor will require some sort of mechanical work, have poor gas mileage, and cause loss of income when they are unable to go their job due to loss of transportation? And is it not possible that someone who cannot afford regular doctor and dental visits because they do not have health insurance would miss a health concern that could be easily treated if detected early, which if let untreated will cost much more to treat and risk of death all because they are poor?"
iamatotalpieceofshit,fne7nk7,t1_fne5yr4,1586884493.0,"There are some that do, but many more do not. Childcare alone is half of most lower wage earners’ incomes. That is only one example. Most people are also in debt, which could take a large amount of their paychecks. Most people have car payments, need to pay for gas, and have other expenses that they have to pay in order to continue working. Many Americans have to pay for health insurance that is not covered by their jobs and have health related expenses that they cannot afford. Just a few things that come to mind."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fne5ndy,t1_fne20rh,1586883487.0,Not everyone is paid more than the cost of their living expenses. So you’re comment isn’t based in reality.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fndxa9d,t1_fnbthsz,1586879207.0,Most people who are unemployed are not getting unemployment. Do you really not understand that? And you would rather be on the verge of homelessness than getting paid to do your job that you signed up for? Sure.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fndplra,t1_fndodhs,1586875062.0,Okay. What does that have to do with my statement? I said that she is out of touch for wishing that she could be laid off because it is to do so when a very large proportion of the population is laid off and is not getting paid and struggling because of it. She didn’t say I would rather be laid off because it is better economically do so. She casually threw around the idea of being laid off. It’s not a question of math.
relationship_advice,fndoua1,t1_fndkwrx,1586874635.0,"Huh? This isn’t a soap opera. This is real life, and if she decides that her marriage is worth saving then there is nothing wrong with wanting to do so. She hasn’t even heard his side of the story. People make mistakes. I would hate to think that someone would break up their family if they do not want to do so on the advice of Reddit. I’m not saying that she should stay. But she should if she thinks that this is something they can work out."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fndny1c,t1_fndlc3v,1586874124.0,Who would? The majority people I know are not getting paid at all. This includes myself and husband. And we do not qualify for unemployment nor does someone who is “laid off”. The people who do qualify for unemployment are unable to even apply because of the wait times. You clearly have no idea what you are talking about.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fnd3ny2,t3_g0n9qo,1586857481.0,"I’m not condoning this guy’s comment, but by the look of the replies, there are many people here who seem to think that the unemployed are better off than essential workers. This is most definitely not the case. 

Most people who are unemployed, the vast majority are unable to receive unemployment benefits, or unpaid leave are not sitting at home on vacation. Many would rather be working, so they can provide for themselves and their families. They are struggling in ways that you can clearly not even begin to comprehend. They are being evicted from the home or apartment they rent. They are at risk of losing the home they own. They have spent their lifesavings. They are depending on family members for financial support, if they are lucky enough to be able to do so. They are rationing food. They are making hard decisions and sacrifices to merely survive. They are sinking further into debt that will likely follow them for years to come. They may have lost their health insurance during a gd pandemic. And more importantly, they have absolutely no promise of job security now or in the future. 

I am not saying that nurses and doctors are not important or that their lives are easy right now, but at least you have a job. So it is completely unfair for you to look down on those who have lost theirs. Sure, you should be praised for caring for those who are sick and putting your lives at risk. That’s obviously an incredibly necessary and significant service right now. But remember that you are being paid to do so, likely very well. And you are doing exactly the job you signed up for and we’re trained to do. If you have any kind of education in this field, you should have known that a pandemic was a possibility and even a likelihood. You are not a volunteer. But you should be praised. Thank you for doing your job that you are being paid to do. Our lives depend on it. 

Other lower paid essential workers are also worthy of praise and putting their lives at risk as well. And they are even more likely to not have health insurance through their jobs, unlike health workers. They are being asked to do a lot more than their job requirements initially entailed. They did not sign up for this. And with the current job climate, they are at risk of losing theirs if they do decide to take time off. Because there is obviously a lot of people who are out of work and desperately seeking employment. 

Those who are essential workers, and those who are now unemployed are both having a hard time. There are very few unemployed people who are financially benefiting, by receiving more benefits than they were paid while employees, from the pandemic."

PurplePillDebate,fnckib5,t3_g0y3p4,1586839089.0,"I think you have a very strange way of looking at things. You are complaining that a woman that you were casually seeing started to like you enough that she wanted to be with you exclusively. The appropriate response would be to be flattered. Instead, you are suggesting that she is doing something wrong. If you don't want to be with someone that will develop feelings for you, you should probably make that clear from the beginning and reinforce that throughout your relationship. A woman isn't going to see you as a potential boyfriend unless you are taking her on dates or saying things that a boyfriend would say. Don't lead her on, be honest, and be consistent."
relationship_advice,fncgxoo,t1_fncfa39,1586836484.0,"If you have similar interests, that could be another reason she is interested. So that makes a least two reasons she could be attracted to you. You are financially stable, and you have things in common. In the dating world, you already sound like a catch based on those two things alone. 

As a woman, I can assure you that an attractive woman with many other options is not going to be wasting time with a person that she isn't interested in physically or with a person that she feels has an undesirable personality. She likes you. Don't worry about it. 

For me, I personally prefer to be with men that would be considered less attractive than me according to mainstream beauty standards. It's nice to feel like I have something to offer a person. I find it reassuring. Women get self-conscious too, and it's not always based on our appearances. All women really want is to be with someone who makes them feel special. But also, maybe she actually is physically attracted to you and your type. My preferences don't even closely represent what is considered to be an attractive male in our society. Everyone is different. You shouldn't just assume that she thinks you are not good looking."

There is nothing wrong with either of those things."
PurplePillDebate,fnc6pwv,t1_fnaqjx0,1586829794.0,"Yes. I'm a woman. I just picked one of the usernames suggested when creating the account. And I thought it was the least terrible of the few recommended, and that it would be personally amusing to me because I am a woman.

As far as aesthetics, I think a penis that is proportional in length and width would be preferable. One that has more girth than it is long would be pretty off-putting, imo. I have encountered this. If I personally had to choose between the two on appearances alone, I would definitely pick length. But as I said, I prefer slightly smaller than average or average in both length and width. It should be noted that I am petite, so that may be some sort of consideration that I am unconsciously making. 

Everyone has different preferences. But I honestly do believe that most women do not actually care that much, and I believe that our society has conditioned us into the ""bigger is better"" idea. There are definitely women who feel differently than I do, but I think that many only like bigger than average penises because they were told that they should. The same goes for men's preferences of bigger boobs/butts or blondes. Whatever the case, it is hard for me to believe that women actually want a sledgehammer sized dick swinging at them."
PurplePillDebate,fn9ceet,t3_g03cf6,1586767490.0,"I find a large penis to be repulsive. I think the whole bigger is better thing is complete bullshit and for whatever reason, our society decided this to be true. Most women, IMO, do not want to have a huge dick crammed inside of them. That is painful and just unnecessary. 

Besides, the vast majority of women can only orgasm through clitoral stimulation. Keep that in mind."
PurplePillDebate,fn9atmy,t1_fn99z4j,1586765727.0,"Generally, dating indicates more than one person at a time. At least, that is how it is defined in this generation. Dating is not a relationship, and it's rarely exclusive in the beginning. And wouldn't ""casual encounters with guys you barely know"" be the potential beginning of a relationship??"
PurplePillDebate,fn9a2b8,t1_fn923il,1586764887.0,"I don't think women see makeup as concealing their appearances. We aren't exactly trying to look like a different person. Some just prefer the way they look with makeup, and it often has nothing to do with attracting a partner. Makeup is more of an embellishment, like clothing. It's fun. It's not always that serious. There are definitely women that do feel insecure without makeup. And some apply more than others, but that is because of the higher expectations placed on women's appearances in our society. This is why encouraging ""self-love"" and ""acceptance"" is important. 

There is nothing hypocritical about it. Women can reject men with or without makeup. And men can do the same. Attraction is subjective. Some men even prefer a full face of makeup on a woman. And men should feel free to apply it as well since they seem to think women have some sort of unfair advantage because of it."

That's dating, and it's not exactly new. College kids are going to drink. There is absolutely nothing you can or should do to prevent your daughter from having sex. The best thing to do is to provide your adult children with support and acceptance and respect.

AskReddit,fkl61mn,t3_fj6kuo,1584299259.0,"I am considering relocating, but I haven't found a place that feels like a good fit. I currently live in Austin and love it here, but it is changing so much that it no longer feels like somewhere I belong. Austin is now all tech-bros and trust funds. I am neither. Austin is losing its appeal. All of the places I once frequented are now full of bachelorette parties and guys with buzz cuts. Nobody cares about the music scene anymore. If I go to a show, I can barely hear the music over people talking about Instagram or whatever. It is definitely no longer weird. Austin no longer caters to artists, only those with money. I know it was bound to happen. I can't decide if Austin is no longer cool, or am I no longer. So here I am doing the very uncool thing of complaining about it on the internet. Austin just doesn't have the same open-minded, creative community that originally motivated me to move here. I want to live somewhere that is affordable, liberal, and interesting. Does this even exist anymore? My husband and I are both creatives. He is a video editor, and I am a copywriter. So we need to be somewhere that there is at least a small market for that sort of work. We like to go out a lot. We like coffee shops, galleries, and dive bars. I am very into food, so I would like to live somewhere that has a fair amount of quality grocery stores and a restaurant scene. That's very important to us. We also have a kid, so a city with kid-friendly beer gardens and outdoor activities would also be preferable. Austin has all of these thing, but the cost of living is really pushing us out. We would like to own a home and live comfortably. Is there a place like this that you can own a home for less than $250,000? I prefer somewhere as liberal as possible, but it's not a must. I just don't want to feel like I am not able to find like-minded people. I do also like warmer weather. Colder weather is okay, but I really don't want to be shoveling snow. Because I have a family, I would like to live somewhere with lower crime rates, but I also know that living in a city almost guarantees some crime. That is another thing. I would prefer a city with at least 100,000 people. And most importantly I don't want to live in a city that feels like the suburbs. I am fine with a more rural old town like city or a real downtown city feel, but I don't want to live in the middle of chain restaurants and stores. I want to live somewhere that has small businesses, where I can feel like I really belong and contribute to a community. Coming from Houston, I would really not like to live anywhere that has an ongoing threat of natural disasters. Any recommendations would be cool."
