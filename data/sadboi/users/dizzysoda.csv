LongDistance,fonsgy4,t1_fonprq0,1587925579.0,"Kind of yes! Brujeria is often lumped in with Santeria in all the resources I’ve looked at online. Santeria is more associated with the Caribbean/West Africa- Brujeria isn’t tied to a specific Latin-American country, as what you practice is different for every country, and every region of every country. I follow some people online who are brujas from Puerto Rico, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, the southwest of the US, etc... And they all practice different things. It’s really interesting :-) It’s semi-obscure though, since the way you usually learn is through word of mouth through elders in your family."
LongDistance,fonpbsm,t1_fono5z7,1587923847.0,"Brujeria is a kind of Mexican/Latino folk magic. It roughly translates to “witchcraft”, and a brujo/bruja is a “witch”. It often combines folk magic coming from pre-colonization days and (sometimes but not always) Catholic imagery. Brujeria is often looked down on by the church and religious Latinos because Brujas are often associated with the devil. Brujas can choose to do “dark” magic but many choose not to. Brujas are not to be confused with Curanderas (who practice Curanderismo), who are folk healers who use herbalism, magic, and religion to heal others. Curanderas are generally seen positively.

My grandmother grew up in a rural village in Mexico, and the only healthcare they had was from the services of a curandera. My grandmother knows so many remedies and practices kitchen magic regularly. I identify as a brujo, but some things between brujeria and curanderismo intersect/overlap, so I use my grandmother’s herbal remedies when I deem it appropriate. My dad’s friends also know many brujos and brujas and seek their help regularly, so I’m no stranger to them.

Seems kind of out there but it’s a big cultural thing. :-)"

My uncles can be jackasses sometimes but for the most part everyone’s fine and supports me. My extended family buys me beyond meat whenever we have a BBQ just for me and grills it on a separate grill. You don’t know me or my family or my experience. The issue is separate from that.

vegan,fo7tvvt,t1_fo7snrh,1587584465.0,"Yeah, it took my dad over a year to come around. At first he’d poke fun at my food but then he started trying it once his high blood pressure got really bad. Now he’s almost in normal range :p But you’re right. Neither side fully gets it. Meat and dairy and eggs are ingrained in a lot of Latino cultures cuisines, and if your grandparents are rancheros (like mine lol), they REALLY don’t get it. My grandma has tried to serve me chicken broth on several occasions because she just doesn’t understand how you could possibly cook without animal products. I tried going vegetarian as a child and she’d serve me hot dogs because she didn’t know what to feed me. Then would be sad when I didn’t eat them lol.

And white vegans understand veganism in relation to them and their own experiences, but they are not people of color, so they don’t fully get it either. In my opinion, the way that culture and veganism intersect can be both a beautiful and incredibly stressful thing at times.

None of the vegans I know online ever know what I’m talking about when I talk about food, and my uncles always make fun of me for not eating meat. It’s kinda awful lol

Over the time that I’ve been vegan though, I’ve bonded with my mother by trying vegan Mexican recipes we find (I suggest Más vegan and Cocina vegan fácil on youtube) together and inventing our own. Although she is not vegan (I’m nudging her towards being vegetarian though, at least for a first step- she’s practically already there), it almost feels like I have a little community, as I cook for my whole family most days of the week and they always compliment me and go for seconds. I’ve been interested in trying to see if there’s any online Latino vegan Facebook groups or something, since I know that community is what I personally need to feel happy.

I’m a college student with a 3.1 GPA, and I should graduate in 3 years... though I’m frustrated that it’s taking me this long. I’m entering the second half of my third year. I’m aiming at eventually getting my Ph.D and teaching English at the college level, though I’m still at a community college, so I have a long way to go.

I don’t have a job. Last time I had a job, I seriously felt like killing myself every day I was there. I’d curl up in bed and sob my eyes out whenever I got home. I’m only 20, so I don’t have a lot of experience though. I’ve decided to only focus on school, and go full time with 12 units a semester.

I go to therapy weekly and see my psychiatrist once a month at least. Sometimes I see her once every 2 weeks, which I’m doing right now because I’m switching meds. I’ve been on 8 psych meds total, and after 4.5 years, I’m still trying to find the right med combo. Some meds have really worked for me, but the side effects caused me and my psychiatrist to agree to try something else. I have tardive dyskinesia because of antipsychotics, it might be permanent but we’re not sure yet. I’m on Lamictal, Trazodone, and Abilify right now. Lamictal has saved my life, the only thing we’re working on right now is finding a good antipsychotic, so I hope Abilify works.

Although we’re not the closest, I do have friends. I see them every once in a while and we have fun. I have issues with moderation when it comes to drugs and alcohol (I don’t touch any of it anymore), so I’m lucky that they don’t partake around me. None of them know that I’m schizoaffective, but they’re supportive of my sexuality and gender identity so I feel lucky. I also have a wonderful boyfriend who supports me to the moon and back, and is the sweetest in the world when it comes to my symptoms. He accepts me wholeheartedly and I’ve never felt that before, he makes me very happy.

My family is really supportive. When my symptoms get really bad, my mom stays with me the entire time and watches movies with me to help me calm down and get distracted. She listens to me and takes me to my appointments when I’m too tired to drive, or when I’m experiencing hallucinations. My dad and siblings don’t totally understand but they support me too. My extended family doesn’t know and I intent to keep it that way, or else I’ll be gossiped about forever.

Overall I think my life is pretty okay. I haven’t felt depressed in a whole year because of Lamictal, so I can apply the skills I learn in therapy without depression getting in the way. My therapist is very proud of me for how far I’ve come- she said I don’t really need constant therapy anymore but we’re gonna finish up DBT anyway. I feel fulfilled in my relationships. School keeps me busy and provides a routine for me, which keeps me on track. I think I’m okay because I have a lot of support in my life. Without it, I don’t know where I’d be. But I’m doing well considering the circumstances."

He eventually friended me and starting PMing me each time I updated, even if I didn’t promote the new chapter. I always knew he was different. I took notice to him very early on and was fond of him, and he later admitted that he thought I was really cool and intimidating since he was a fan of my content. I started finding excuses to message him, and we started talking more and more. He told me he wanted to hug and kiss me but I still somehow didn’t catch on LOL.

We’re both in college right now.

I was severely traumatized from various forms of abuse in my childhood, so things were already bad as I kept getting more and more depressed/suicidal from the unresolved trauma, then I broke into psychosis when I was at the tail-end of a failing “relationship” with an adult who was grooming and emotionally abusing me."

MtSAC,f7l4aia,t1_f7kzasj,1573832432.0,"There’s an instructor that walks around to make sure people aren’t sitting down at the machines with their phones out, and you can ask him questions if you want, but you’re mostly on your own until the midterm and the final."
