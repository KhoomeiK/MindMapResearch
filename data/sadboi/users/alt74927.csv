depression,fnuwtn8,t3_g41dok,1587273232.0,"Well some people have reasons to live. Religion is a pretty good one, this life being a test to get into heaven. Other people have certain goals like making money or achieving something special to them. Some people live for their children's sakes. Anyone who says their life has no upsides at all is lying, it doesn't matter how much suffering someone goes through, there will be ups in their life and some people live just to get that feeling happieness again and again. So if you're saying you can't understand why people keep living, you're just fooling yourself. Maybe you don't have a reason for living but it's up to you to find one. There are plenty of reasons out there, it's just about finding the right one for you. 

I wish you luck."

exmuslim,fjcvui4,t3_fcshg7,1583238497.0,"Yeah arranged marriages and emotional blackmail is the worst. My cousin in Pakistan was married about a year, but the circumstances were so fucked up. The guy was originally getting married to someone else and my cousin was invited to their wedding, however the guys mother is really controlling and thought she would lose him to his soon to be wife, so she called it all off. Then my cousin got the offer to marry him and she didn't really want to. However my grandma was getting really upset and really wanted her to do it, so she caved in and decided to marry the guy even though she didn't really like him all that much. As time went on, they started to fall in love with each other and the guys mother didn't like it so she baisically stopped my cousin from seeing him. Soon she got pregnant as well and her situation at this point was fucked up. She was regnant and could barely see her husband. She was a complete mess and when I went over there, I wasn't fully aware until her younger sister told me, but looking back, she looked so depressed and kept making suicidal jokes.

Emotional blackmails a bitch and I hope you don't go through it."

But recently Ive been questioning shit. I've left my religion and I'm very lost. But you're right, I can't be the only person like this, I'm sure there are thousands of people at different ages who done know what they're doing, but they keep pushing forward and that's what I need to do.

I'm an ex Muslim and originally from Pakistan. I'm currently in my last year of high-school moving on to university this year. Also let's not forget depressed as hell with no clue as to what I'm doing in life. Hell I don't even know if I'll be alive in like 5 years. I have a host of issues but I try not to let them get in other people's way. I'm also a bit chubby and I barely leave my room, mainly playing video games on my pc or watching a TV show / anime. I have a pretty dark sense of humour, mostly amounting to suicide/depression jokes, but I try and make people laugh, normally through self deprication.

Also your post my made me laugh a lot, I like the witty jokes in your post. Originally I was just going to comment that, but I thought hey we can be at least friends if you want, idk about anything more because of the distance but we can see how things go. Feel free to dm me if you haw questions. But I may not reply until morning as its 2am and I have school tomorrow. 

Anyways if you decide to pass me by, good luck in finding someone.
