Bikes ive owned

2009 R6

1997 Kawasaki Vulcan VN750

1974 Honda CL360

Bikes I like

Yamaha MT07

Say what ya want (even a 4 star motel can have bugs) the truth is low priced hotels more than likely spend less on preventative maintence, have less staff that would notice a potential infestation, can afford to close down rooms if their is an infestation. 

My gf and i stayed at a ""roach motel"" and literally brought home roaches we haven't been able to get rid of. It times up perfectly from when we stayed there, when we say the baby nypmhs and how long until we saw adults running around.

The big companies are the only ones with capital to manage the risks associated with creating new dedicated lines.

You and I can't say ""tomorrow we will spend 15 million dollars on a new line to make raw milk and turn it into pints of ice cream which can be sold to millions of people, cheaper than whats  currently out there""

If we make a mistake in our assumptions and turns out Americans strongly prefer quarts of frozen yogurt instead, we'd go bankrupt very fast.  

Those big companies can manage the risk of losing millions in an initial investment,  they can even afford to add a few nore million to make changes to run a new product. 

I hate greedy CEOs, shareholders etc just as much as anyone but the consumer is also to blame in this.

Unless we all want to buy a crate of 300 , 24 packs of eggs at walmart 200 dollars, it is more profitable in the long run to destroy the food. 

The other thing is to have the U.S. government step in and give those companies interest free loans to make those modifications,  but we would see articles like ""Nestle given 400 million dollar bailout""

The other option is for private producers out of good will invest their own millions/billions modifying this equipment at a loss of profit. Shareholders and investors would pull out and the company wont have money to finance and manage risks.

Companies have to invest in dedicated lines which is costly.  And to anyone who thinks ""why dont they make machinery more flexible to be changed"" well its not as if supply chain, engineers etc havent tried or thought that. The more special configurations you want, and package size the more changeover required. Changeover is down time, meaning no money. If you want quick changeover and drop in assemblies,  parts, brackets etc its expensive to make them reliable and accurate. 

More flexible equipment, means machines run slower and product costs more. Faster equipment means the requirement for dedicated lines with very small downtime, meaning not much change.
