I used to have an active life with healthy routines such as going to the gym in the morning before work, sleep regularly, and socializing often.  Now I’m struggling holding any sort of routine and feel unmotivated the moment I open my eyes in the morning.  I have a job, but my productivity and motivation have plummeted significantly.  

I’m a single guy, living a lone, not able to visit my parents across town because I would hate for them to become ill if I am carrying the virus.  Not being in a relationship, and the prospect of not finding a partner in a bar or coffee shop has this feeling like a really lonely time right now.  

When the gym opens, I’ll be able to workout all of my frustrations, but for now, I am struggling."
