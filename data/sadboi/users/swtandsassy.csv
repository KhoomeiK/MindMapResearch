January2021BabyBumps,fr3kl0p,t3_gm5gee,1589859449.0,"Hey all. I just had my first appt today to confirm pregnancy with urine testing. That’s it. I called in to get an appt for the 8-10 week in as soon as I found out I was pregnant, and the lady made me an appt to come in today. I was surprised I even had to go in. 

The midwife I met with said she saw a faint line, but can confirm pregnancy even though it’s still a bit early, and wanted me to come in for an U/S at 10 weeks. I just felt dumbfounded because I already confirmed with 5 pregnancy tests that I’m pregnant. I also felt the conversation between the midwife and I just wasn’t a good experience... it felt like “ok you’re pregnant, take these vitamins, see you in 10 weeks, bye”. :( I’m thinking of changing to an OB at another hospital tomorrow just because I didn’t feel cared for today. I don’t even know what the purpose of the appt was when I already knew I was pregnant lol. Anybody else go for a “pregnancy confirmation” appt before their u/s? Is it just my hormones?! I can’t help but feel bad about today and the experience I had with the midwife..."
January2021BabyBumps,fr3iex6,t3_gm7wsa,1589858082.0,Done thanks mods!
January2021BabyBumps,fr3gqmr,t3_gmd6lv,1589857069.0,"*Long post ahead!* I’m so happy you made this post! I’m following to see more insight from others. So I actually want to share my experience that may be helpful. 

I’m only about 4weeks, and have been researching which OB to see. There’s one OB/women’s care center close to my house, and they had good reviews. I saw that you have the option to choose between a physician or midwife or BOTH during labor. Their website also really made them seem spa-like and caring. I think I was a little naive, made my call today to get my first appointment in, and they wanted me to come in today for a confirmation test! 

I didn’t think I had to do that, but I went in anyway and checked in. They had assigned me with a midwife. I was excited to meet her, but felt our conversation was one-sided (me being excited and asking questions), and her being not as caring as I’d expected and didn’t really get to know me. She basically said I’m still early, and she’ll see me in 10 weeks. I was hoping for 8 weeks... and I asked the front desk lady to change it to 8, and she was able to. 

Fast forward, now I’m sitting here wanting to change to an OB tomorrow at the hospital I’d most likely deliver in. I don’t know if I just had a bad experience with the midwife, but I was expecting a longer conversation or at least show excitement for me? I’m not sure if I wanted to go the midwife route in the first place, and just happened to meet one today without realizing. I have nothing against midwives, but I was expecting an OB or at least given the choice in the beginning. So my advice is to also make sure you ask questions right away upfront from setting up the appointment, and what to expect. I was a little deceived by the website, and didn’t receive that “wow factor” as I expected. I’m so bummed!!

Best wishes to you though as you find THE one! There’s so much info out there!"
TryingForABaby,fr2mgbj,t3_gm88ju,1589839886.0,"Hi! I hesitated about sharing this response, and I may or may not be the odd one out here. I just read your post, and I was in the same boat before we tried to get pregnant. I thought there’s no way I could get pregnant on our first time, definitely sealed that thought in my head. Well, lo and behold, I did end up getting pregnant on our first try. I only found out several days ago, and I’m still in disbelief. For that alone, it’s been hard for me to feel excited because I am under pressure that others might see me as bragging if I talk about it on subreddits? Which I am totally not or ever intend to. I’m just excited and celebrating this, and i don’t know why but I feel guilty for celebrating which I know I shouldn’t. I also went to to see my OB today to confirm pregnancy, and I was just excited and said I’m just in disbelief that we got it our first try... and I swear the midwife didn’t respond to me positively. It was more like “oh.. okay”. I guess I don’t know what I was expecting. Might have to switch OB lol. 

I just wanted to come on here and say that 1.) I am one of the ones that got pregnant on our first try, but I also went through anxiety and fear 2.) I am not bragging by no means, and I fear that by telling someone we got it on our first try if they asked, I would feel guilty and weird? Like what am I supposed to say 3.) I know a lot of people that have a hard time conceiving, and I will always be a considerate and respectful person when it comes to talking about it etc. 

Now there may be people that are actually bragging and that’s not okay. But I also believe there are people that are just truly celebrating and feel excited. It’s a big deal, however long or quick you were able to get pregnant. Everybody is different and we should be able to respect that ❤️"

His behavior is NOT okay, and not normal. It is NOT your hormones. Please don’t blame yourself for his behavior! He sounds manipulative and abusive. You’re pregnant, and instead of caring for you, he does the complete opposite? Whoever finds that funny is clearly a psycho. 

Please stay with your family, and consider breaking up! He needs to know you’re being serious otherwise this has no end and will get worse 100%. I’m so sorry you have to go through this. Stand up for yourself and be strong ❤️ say peace out!"

Continued to test on 12 and 13 and the lines getting darker. I’d say just test according to your cycle and see what it says! There’s no way of knowing unless you test."

I don’t know why I’m in denial right now! I think it’s because I want to see dark lines, but obviously from seeing other posts on here, any line like this is a good sign yes? Somebody tell me it’s a BFP! 😫 

We also tried for the first time... and after reading about so many difficulties and knowing people that go through it, I just felt like there’s no way we could get it first try. So yes... I’m still checking the line over and over again to make sure it’s real. ❤️ can’t wait to check tomorrow already!! My husband doesn’t understand tests and the lightening and darkening, and so I had to explain to him that a second line is positive. He is excited, but still wants to wait for my AF to make sure it’s 💯😆"

1-4 DPO - I kept getting mild cramps and twinges on my left side ONLY at night 
4-6 DPO - twinges, mild cramps at night time 
7-9 DPO - changes in taste to certain foods. Bitter aftertaste eating veggie straws and coffee
11 DPO - last night I woke up around 3am to mild cramping/uncomfortable and lower back pain. This morning I got out of bed dry heaving a little from feeling a tiny bit nauseous.

Gosh, I hope I’m not crazy and all of these are PMS symptoms besides the taste changing and dry heaving 😆😫 I know our brain can do wonders into tricking us. I can’t decide if I want to wait for AF or go out and buy a few more tests to see any progression! Ahhh!!!"

This may have been answered somewhere already, but I’m wondering if someone could help me better understand. I’m self employed and got PPP 2 weeks ago. At the time, I didn’t get unemployment... and now it came through with backpay. I haven’t used the PPP funds yet, and it’s sitting in my other bank checking account. Unemployment isn’t much for me, but it is nice since I don’t have to pay it back. 

I’ve heard of people giving PPP back, not touching it, and/or absolutely clueless. I haven’t touched a dime at all. I have qualifying/forgivable expenses that I’ve organized when I intended to use it. I also heard there’s that 8 week timeline that you’re supposed to use it right away from when you get the funds? Can someone clarify this? There’s so many diff advices out there, and I’m just wanting to keep it for emergency really because unemployment isn’t enough for me, and it was already a pain applying for PPP. Obviously I am not double dipping and using both funds. I’m just unsure what to do if I feel that I’d  use the PPP if unemployment is over by July (my expiration)."

I’m sorry that you had that experience! The TO’s Azelaic Acid is 10%, so I’m wondering if yours was too strong for your skin? I don’t feel anything when I apply it to my skin, and I have pretty sensitive skin. Also yours is gel form, and I think that may penetrate deeper into the skin? I don’t think it should be leaving you red lesions unless you’re having a bad reaction which may be the case.

TO’s version is silicon base, and I like the feel of it. You could always try it out, and it’s pretty affordable for $7. Let me know if you have other questions!"

SkincareAddiction,fqakb8a,t1_fqaem5g,1589220520.0,"Thank you! In the before photo, I was defeated! I kept getting angry pimples that would take forever to go away, and they were always so inflamed and itchy. 

I’ve been using Azelaic Acid for a month now, and I think it’s been helpful for smoothing/toning out my skin. I apply it all over my face (a pea drop is sufficient). I also believe simplifying my skin care routine has helped too. Maybe my skin just doesn’t react well with multiple layers of products. I could never do the Korean skincare routine for that reason alone! 

Good luck to you!!!"
SkincareAddiction,fqajyho,t1_fqa8b7h,1589220347.0,"Thank you! Just working on those red marks! Honestly, I feel like it started working right away for me. I say that because I usually will get new pimples along my jawline or cheeks, and since I’ve started using it, everything has been smooth and consistent. My skin is less oily, matte + smoother. I’ve been using it for a month now, and haven’t broke out from it at all! I think the red marks are slowly fading."

SkincareAddiction,fqa4n3m,t3_ghq8ph,1589212742.0,"Hello, everyone! I posted about a month ago about purchasing The Ordinary’s Azelaic Acid instead of the prescribed option that was $200. I’ve started to see results from it, and wanted to share with you my findings, and my new skin care routine!

The picture that you see from Jan 2019 was a time where I felt like I REALLY needed help. I wasn’t on any medications, and didn’t really have my routine down. Shortly after that, I decided to get back on Bactrim (an antibiotic that worked wonderfully for me during my college years). I had to come off in the first place because I was on it for four years straight, and my doc stopped prescribing me it (so sad). Long story short, my skin erupted in angry acne and I had to start all over again at the age of 28. 

I came back on Bactrim (February) because I was desperate to have clear skin before my wedding day (October). Bactrim worked FAST for me, and I was relieved. Deep down I knew though that I’d come back off after my wedding since you shouldn’t be on it long-term. I was willing to risk angry acne again just to have clear skin on my wedding day. Fast forward to my wedding day (four months later), my skin was glowing and acne free! A week after my wedding, I stopped taking Bactrim, and saw a new dermatologist to find a plan. My derm heard my concerns and prescribed me Spironolactone that was an overall healthier option for long-term use. I was on Spiro for about three months, and then my husband and I decided that we were going to try for a baby in the upcoming months. WELP! I had to wean off Spiro. just when it was starting to work so I don’t risk any abnormalities while trying to conceive. Talk about being frustrated with my adult acne! I went back to the derm to tell her about our pregnancy plans, and that’s when she prescribed me Azelaic Acid and mentioned how it was safe for pregnancy, and helpful with acne flare ups, rosacea/redness, and hyperpigmentation. 

UPDATE: While coming off Spiro and introducing Azelaic Acid to my skincare, I’ve decided to update my routine overall. The BIGGEST change for me was SIMPLIFYING my routine. BEFORE: For AM + PM, I used to do cleanser, toner, spot treatment, moisturizer. Occasionally I would exfoliate 1-2x a week. NOW, I’ve stepped back and don’t cleanse in the morning, taken out toning, and introduce natural oils as a moisturizer. My skin is really loving this change, and I still can’t believe that this was all it took after suffering with acne since 12. 

Here’s my recap:
-acne since 12
-I’ve tried lasering, facials, chemical peels, birth control, Bactrim (temporarily works), and Spironolactone (works, but had to come off for personal reasons). I’ve also tried differin, and Tretinoin. Other OTC acne medication such as toners, and spot treatments (BP and Salicylic Acid). 

My new routine:
AM: 
1.) Pat skin with Warm/Hot water to wake up skin, and then use wash cloth with warm water to gently exfoliate the oils and grime. Air dry! My skin feels SMOOTH and plump after this!
2.) Apply thin layer of TO’s Azelaic Acid 
3.) Pat in Biossance Tea Tree Oil + Squalene Oil 

PM: 
1.) Cleanse with Cerave Foaming Cleanser for Sensitive Skin + use my Foreo 
2.) spot treatment with BP (if needed) 
3.) Pat in a drop of Biossance Tea Tree Oil + Squalene Oil all over face to lock in hydration 
4.) Occasionally I’ll also pat in Grape Seed Oil if my skin is feeling a little dry

What I’m taking that may also be affecting my skin is Ollie’s Prenatals! I’ve been taking these for the last four months. They’re packed with vitamins so it’s possible my skin hasn’t erupted in acne since coming off Spiro! I just can’t believe the amount of $$$ I’d spent on products and feeling hopeful only to be let down and frustrated every time. I think I finally found my skincare routine, and it’s the simplest version EVER. Now I’m just focusing on my post acne marks and redness which I believe the Azelaic acid will continue to help with over time. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this! I truly appreciate it and wish you all a wonderful skincare journey!!!"
