January2021BabyBumps,fr3kl0p,t3_gm5gee,1589859449.0,"Hey all. I just had my first appt today to confirm pregnancy with urine testing. That‚Äôs it. I called in to get an appt for the 8-10 week in as soon as I found out I was pregnant, and the lady made me an appt to come in today. I was surprised I even had to go in. 

The midwife I met with said she saw a faint line, but can confirm pregnancy even though it‚Äôs still a bit early, and wanted me to come in for an U/S at 10 weeks. I just felt dumbfounded because I already confirmed with 5 pregnancy tests that I‚Äôm pregnant. I also felt the conversation between the midwife and I just wasn‚Äôt a good experience... it felt like ‚Äúok you‚Äôre pregnant, take these vitamins, see you in 10 weeks, bye‚Äù. :( I‚Äôm thinking of changing to an OB at another hospital tomorrow just because I didn‚Äôt feel cared for today. I don‚Äôt even know what the purpose of the appt was when I already knew I was pregnant lol. Anybody else go for a ‚Äúpregnancy confirmation‚Äù appt before their u/s? Is it just my hormones?! I can‚Äôt help but feel bad about today and the experience I had with the midwife..."
January2021BabyBumps,fr3iex6,t3_gm7wsa,1589858082.0,Done thanks mods!
January2021BabyBumps,fr3gqmr,t3_gmd6lv,1589857069.0,"*Long post ahead!* I‚Äôm so happy you made this post! I‚Äôm following to see more insight from others. So I actually want to share my experience that may be helpful. 

I‚Äôm only about 4weeks, and have been researching which OB to see. There‚Äôs one OB/women‚Äôs care center close to my house, and they had good reviews. I saw that you have the option to choose between a physician or midwife or BOTH during labor. Their website also really made them seem spa-like and caring. I think I was a little naive, made my call today to get my first appointment in, and they wanted me to come in today for a confirmation test! 

I didn‚Äôt think I had to do that, but I went in anyway and checked in. They had assigned me with a midwife. I was excited to meet her, but felt our conversation was one-sided (me being excited and asking questions), and her being not as caring as I‚Äôd expected and didn‚Äôt really get to know me. She basically said I‚Äôm still early, and she‚Äôll see me in 10 weeks. I was hoping for 8 weeks... and I asked the front desk lady to change it to 8, and she was able to. 

Fast forward, now I‚Äôm sitting here wanting to change to an OB tomorrow at the hospital I‚Äôd most likely deliver in. I don‚Äôt know if I just had a bad experience with the midwife, but I was expecting a longer conversation or at least show excitement for me? I‚Äôm not sure if I wanted to go the midwife route in the first place, and just happened to meet one today without realizing. I have nothing against midwives, but I was expecting an OB or at least given the choice in the beginning. So my advice is to also make sure you ask questions right away upfront from setting up the appointment, and what to expect. I was a little deceived by the website, and didn‚Äôt receive that ‚Äúwow factor‚Äù as I expected. I‚Äôm so bummed!!

Best wishes to you though as you find THE one! There‚Äôs so much info out there!"
TryingForABaby,fr2mgbj,t3_gm88ju,1589839886.0,"Hi! I hesitated about sharing this response, and I may or may not be the odd one out here. I just read your post, and I was in the same boat before we tried to get pregnant. I thought there‚Äôs no way I could get pregnant on our first time, definitely sealed that thought in my head. Well, lo and behold, I did end up getting pregnant on our first try. I only found out several days ago, and I‚Äôm still in disbelief. For that alone, it‚Äôs been hard for me to feel excited because I am under pressure that others might see me as bragging if I talk about it on subreddits? Which I am totally not or ever intend to. I‚Äôm just excited and celebrating this, and i don‚Äôt know why but I feel guilty for celebrating which I know I shouldn‚Äôt. I also went to to see my OB today to confirm pregnancy, and I was just excited and said I‚Äôm just in disbelief that we got it our first try... and I swear the midwife didn‚Äôt respond to me positively. It was more like ‚Äúoh.. okay‚Äù. I guess I don‚Äôt know what I was expecting. Might have to switch OB lol. 

I just wanted to come on here and say that 1.) I am one of the ones that got pregnant on our first try, but I also went through anxiety and fear 2.) I am not bragging by no means, and I fear that by telling someone we got it on our first try if they asked, I would feel guilty and weird? Like what am I supposed to say 3.) I know a lot of people that have a hard time conceiving, and I will always be a considerate and respectful person when it comes to talking about it etc. 

Now there may be people that are actually bragging and that‚Äôs not okay. But I also believe there are people that are just truly celebrating and feel excited. It‚Äôs a big deal, however long or quick you were able to get pregnant. Everybody is different and we should be able to respect that ‚ù§Ô∏è"

7-9 DPO - changes in taste to certain foods. Bitter aftertaste eating veggie straws and coffee
11 DPO - last night I woke up around 3am to mild cramping/uncomfortable and lower back pain. This morning I got out of bed dry heaving a little from feeling a tiny bit nauseous.

This may have been answered somewhere already, but I‚Äôm wondering if someone could help me better understand. I‚Äôm self employed and got PPP 2 weeks ago. At the time, I didn‚Äôt get unemployment... and now it came through with backpay. I haven‚Äôt used the PPP funds yet, and it‚Äôs sitting in my other bank checking account. Unemployment isn‚Äôt much for me, but it is nice since I don‚Äôt have to pay it back. 

I‚Äôve heard of people giving PPP back, not touching it, and/or absolutely clueless. I haven‚Äôt touched a dime at all. I have qualifying/forgivable expenses that I‚Äôve organized when I intended to use it. I also heard there‚Äôs that 8 week timeline that you‚Äôre supposed to use it right away from when you get the funds? Can someone clarify this? There‚Äôs so many diff advices out there, and I‚Äôm just wanting to keep it for emergency really because unemployment isn‚Äôt enough for me, and it was already a pain applying for PPP. Obviously I am not double dipping and using both funds. I‚Äôm just unsure what to do if I feel that I‚Äôd  use the PPP if unemployment is over by July (my expiration)."

I don‚Äôt think it should be leaving you red lesions unless you‚Äôre having a bad reaction which may be the case.

TO‚Äôs version is silicon base, and I like the feel of it. You could always try it out, and it‚Äôs pretty affordable for $7. Let me know if you have other questions!"

SkincareAddiction,fqaysi5,t1_fqaydb7,1589227611.0,Thank you!!
SkincareAddiction,fqau37g,t1_fqarm7r,1589225300.0,"Yes!!! I suffered from adult hormonal acne, and it‚Äôs consistently bad a week before my period. It‚Äôs sad that my skin was loving the BC and Antibiotics I was on, but you‚Äôre not supposed to be on it forever. My body didn‚Äôt like the drastic change and probably caused more hormonal imbalance coming off than before I was on medication. It‚Äôs crazy that I‚Äôm not on any oral medication besides my prenatal vitamins LOL, and my skin is loving it! 

How long were you off oral medication before introducing Azelaic Acid?! Maybe your body is still adjusting internally.."
SkincareAddiction,fqatnxu,t1_fqap45x,1589225092.0,Thanks! Glad to hear it‚Äôs working for you too :)

SkincareAddiction,fqakb8a,t1_fqaem5g,1589220520.0,"Thank you! In the before photo, I was defeated! I kept getting angry pimples that would take forever to go away, and they were always so inflamed and itchy. 

I‚Äôve been using Azelaic Acid for a month now, and I think it‚Äôs been helpful for smoothing/toning out my skin. I apply it all over my face (a pea drop is sufficient). I also believe simplifying my skin care routine has helped too. Maybe my skin just doesn‚Äôt react well with multiple layers of products. I could never do the Korean skincare routine for that reason alone! 

Good luck to you!!!"
SkincareAddiction,fqajyho,t1_fqa8b7h,1589220347.0,"Thank you! Just working on those red marks! Honestly, I feel like it started working right away for me. I say that because I usually will get new pimples along my jawline or cheeks, and since I‚Äôve started using it, everything has been smooth and consistent. My skin is less oily, matte + smoother. I‚Äôve been using it for a month now, and haven‚Äôt broke out from it at all! I think the red marks are slowly fading."

SkincareAddiction,fqa4n3m,t3_ghq8ph,1589212742.0,"Hello, everyone! I posted about a month ago about purchasing The Ordinary‚Äôs Azelaic Acid instead of the prescribed option that was $200. I‚Äôve started to see results from it, and wanted to share with you my findings, and my new skin care routine!

The picture that you see from Jan 2019 was a time where I felt like I REALLY needed help. I wasn‚Äôt on any medications, and didn‚Äôt really have my routine down. Shortly after that, I decided to get back on Bactrim (an antibiotic that worked wonderfully for me during my college years). I had to come off in the first place because I was on it for four years straight, and my doc stopped prescribing me it (so sad). Long story short, my skin erupted in angry acne and I had to start all over again at the age of 28. 

I came back on Bactrim (February) because I was desperate to have clear skin before my wedding day (October). Bactrim worked FAST for me, and I was relieved. Deep down I knew though that I‚Äôd come back off after my wedding since you shouldn‚Äôt be on it long-term. I was willing to risk angry acne again just to have clear skin on my wedding day. Fast forward to my wedding day (four months later), my skin was glowing and acne free! A week after my wedding, I stopped taking Bactrim, and saw a new dermatologist to find a plan. My derm heard my concerns and prescribed me Spironolactone that was an overall healthier option for long-term use. I was on Spiro for about three months, and then my husband and I decided that we were going to try for a baby in the upcoming months. WELP! I had to wean off Spiro. just when it was starting to work so I don‚Äôt risk any abnormalities while trying to conceive. Talk about being frustrated with my adult acne! I went back to the derm to tell her about our pregnancy plans, and that‚Äôs when she prescribed me Azelaic Acid and mentioned how it was safe for pregnancy, and helpful with acne flare ups, rosacea/redness, and hyperpigmentation. 

UPDATE: While coming off Spiro and introducing Azelaic Acid to my skincare, I‚Äôve decided to update my routine overall. The BIGGEST change for me was SIMPLIFYING my routine. BEFORE: For AM + PM, I used to do cleanser, toner, spot treatment, moisturizer. Occasionally I would exfoliate 1-2x a week. NOW, I‚Äôve stepped back and don‚Äôt cleanse in the morning, taken out toning, and introduce natural oils as a moisturizer. My skin is really loving this change, and I still can‚Äôt believe that this was all it took after suffering with acne since 12. 

Here‚Äôs my recap:
-acne since 12
-I‚Äôve tried lasering, facials, chemical peels, birth control, Bactrim (temporarily works), and Spironolactone (works, but had to come off for personal reasons). I‚Äôve also tried differin, and Tretinoin. Other OTC acne medication such as toners, and spot treatments (BP and Salicylic Acid). 

My new routine:
AM: 
1.) Pat skin with Warm/Hot water to wake up skin, and then use wash cloth with warm water to gently exfoliate the oils and grime. Air dry! My skin feels SMOOTH and plump after this!
2.) Apply thin layer of TO‚Äôs Azelaic Acid 
3.) Pat in Biossance Tea Tree Oil + Squalene Oil 

PM: 
1.) Cleanse with Cerave Foaming Cleanser for Sensitive Skin + use my Foreo 
2.) spot treatment with BP (if needed) 
3.) Pat in a drop of Biossance Tea Tree Oil + Squalene Oil all over face to lock in hydration 
4.) Occasionally I‚Äôll also pat in Grape Seed Oil if my skin is feeling a little dry

What I‚Äôm taking that may also be affecting my skin is Ollie‚Äôs Prenatals! I‚Äôve been taking these for the last four months. They‚Äôre packed with vitamins so it‚Äôs possible my skin hasn‚Äôt erupted in acne since coming off Spiro! I just can‚Äôt believe the amount of $$$ I‚Äôd spent on products and feeling hopeful only to be let down and frustrated every time. I think I finally found my skincare routine, and it‚Äôs the simplest version EVER. Now I‚Äôm just focusing on my post acne marks and redness which I believe the Azelaic acid will continue to help with over time. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this! I truly appreciate it and wish you all a wonderful skincare journey!!!"
