Giovanni Gentile, who ghost-wrote most of Mussolini’s official fascist doctrines, was a socialist! look him up! Mussolini was a socialist! look it up! i find it disheartening that this subreddit seems to lack anyone willing to think for themselves- the information has been subverted, but it is out there. Jonah Goldberg’s “Liberal Fascism” is a great read on the subject and i’d challenge anyone to read it cover to cover and present any serious refutation.  fascism is, in fact, left-wing. 

that anybody could seriously believe that a life-long socialist created and ran a extremist RIGHT-WING political system, after leaving the socialist party, speaks only to the level of brainwashing the American public has been subjected to. it’s a real bummer"
