Google what actual propaganda posters looked like from this era, DO NOT COPY THEM but get inspired. 

Maybe even find a website that lets you go through a virtual museum about WW2!! 

Definitely use the list for possible poster topics that your teacher gave you on the assignment sheet. 

What popped into my head was creating a poster that would make American men want to enlist. Like a poster showing Hitler pointing weapons at America with Europe and Allied Powers defeated.  That help any???

Good luck!!!"

Career_Advice,flr6w6s,t3_fqm6nb,1585414207.0,"To decide what major to choose , see if there’s an office at your school that could help. My school has the office of Career Services that offers this really good quiz that can help you narrow down a major. See if your school has anything like that.  AND Find our what classes you need to take for that major!!!! 

Think about what your passions are! Do you like math? art, design, history, computer science, (etc...)? Do you enjoy helping people or serving others? 

What’s something in life that has always fascinated you? What could you wake up and do everyday regardless if you got payed or not?

Look and see the pay for different careers you have in mind, if you need to attend grad school and if so for how long? It’s also good to research if your major could get you any scholarships, like how there are lots of programs to help STEM majors out (and rightly so).
Check out how good the programs for a potential major is, if you think about nursing then look at the College of Nursing at your school and see what they’re about and if the program is any good. 

If you have a specific career in mind go on YouTube and search “Day In the Life if A ( your career choice)”. Seeing what your life could be like with that job is a huge deal. Watching these types of videos really helped me out BUT don’t completely rely on them to make a career or major choice."

 Focus on buying frozen veggies, in my area 12oz bags of broccoli and cauliflower are around $1.00, canned beans, vegetable stock, rice, potatoes, tomato sauce, fruit, oatmeal, and peanut butter. (If you're not allergic) You can get dry beans for an even cheaper price, but then you have to soak them overnight and boil them for hours afterward, nobody has time for that!

Buy the big canister of oatmeal, this is cheaper and it won't be loaded with sugar like the little instant packets are. Bonus if you add peanut butter (fat, protein, and carbs right there!)

When you build these meals the beans are your protein, the vegetables are your carbs, and you can add hummus, or roast potatoes in olive oil in order to get a serving of fat. Focus on these three things, a fat, a protein, a carb. Using this checklist will help you stay healthy, get your calories in, and keep you full until your next meal.

If you buy vegetable stock then you can make soup, or you can add water and a crap ton of spices, both work. Potatoes, frozen veggies, stock/water, and tomatoes make a great soup and will last a good week if you make enough.

Hope this helped"
