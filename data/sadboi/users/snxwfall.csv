Codependency,fq564ym,t3_ggo8wj,1589093756.0,"My mom used to confide in me inappropriately when I was younger. I think it made her feel better to be able to vent to me, regardless of how it effected me. Today my mom posts ungodly things on facebook and it pushes me away and I hate every aspect of how much she continues to embarrass herself on social media. 

Today, I think I’ve somehow unconsciously followed the some path and over share sometimes ESPECIALLY to coworkers. 

I try to use the skill I like to call “Play it out” where you basically play out the scenario of you telling someone something and how it will most likely turn out. 

Will they judge you? Will they actually have insightful advice for you? Will it make them possibly uncomfortable? Will it help you in any way other than that momentary relieve of telling someone whatever you’re thinking about? 

A lot of the time telling people your struggles or personal information helps relieve us by making us feel supported/heard/less alone. But we need to remember that feeling is instant gratification and untrustworthy. 

Hope that helps."
BipolarReddit,fq0h8uu,t3_ggewna,1589031840.0,"Antidepressants, from what I understand aren’t supposed to be long term medications. You take them for 3-5 years MAX. If it’s only been a couple weeks since you’ve stopped taking it, and you’re feeling irritable, I would definitely say that’s your body getting used to not needing the medication and will go away soon. 

Make sure to cover your HALT bases if you’re not feeling well and take extra care of yourself. :)

Edit: I also think that maybe your doc was probably using the antidepressant to help you out of an obvious depressive episode possibly just to cover you while you’re trying to figure out your correct dosage for your mood stabilizer.

Second edit: A lot of times people with bipolar who take antidepressants become less depressed but then their cycling causes them to become manic and more irritable. Just from what I understand as not a professional tbh"
