Whenever you do ANYTHING, you're giving her attention, which fuels her behaviour. She needs to be *ignored* when you need to sleep. I know from experience how hard that is, to pretend you don't notice her, and how hard it is to know you're in for a restless night. I'm not minimising your absolute desperation for sleep; I know sometimes you'd kill for a good few hours.

Look at that gorgeous kitty-kins. She's worth some discomfort, right? I promise. Our kitties now interrupt our sleep once every few weeks, as opposed to every night. Just ignore her, as hard as you can.

Hmm, scratching is a problem. If she has a favourite piece of furniture, can you cover it with double-sided sticky tape? My kits *hate* the feel of that,  and with an added dab of orange oil, they won't go close. Books recommend adding a few more scratching posts around your place, if you can afford it and have space."
