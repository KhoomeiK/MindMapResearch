The issue though is that this isn’t always the case. Plenty of people who go to the gym are there because they are obese or overweight and many of the comorbidities of covid aren’t always apparent.

Plus, lifting weights doesn’t always correlate to “good health”. It is probably better than nothing, but I’ve known many guys who were strong as an ox but still had shit cholesterol and such.

If the bar was rigid the whole way through, the weight would be more static. With this bar though, if it takes, say, 350 pounds to make it bend, you’ll be lifting 350 pounds until you pick the actual weights off the floor.

But, like you said, she’s still pulling all the weight as soon as they leave the floor. It’s dumb to suggest that there would be “no way” she would lift it otherwise, but a stiff bar deadlift is a harder lift with the same weight."

The rules don’t stipulate a maximum width so, if you wanted, you could spread yours legs all the way out and, as long as you could pull to lockout, it would be a valid lift.
