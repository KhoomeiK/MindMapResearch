DestinyTheGame,fouhuow,t3_g5q47u,1588084344.0,"Ok, I am Titan, but I'd assume it will be the same for all classes.

 Select the required subclass.  Have your melee box charged (middle box under supercharge bar)  and punch when it is fully charged. That should give you 1 kill.  You have to wait till it is fully charged again for it count for another kill.

Hope that makes sense."

I have completed the survey. I'm now looking into Sparx. .. Oh it's only available in New Zealand. Well I will keep an eye on that, it sounded good."
selfharm,forqxy7,t3_g90l49,1588016953.0,Thank you for this. I am 1 month free of SH today. The struggle is real.

selfharm,fn63hkq,t3_fwvqe2,1586685954.0,Thank you for your comments. I managed to beat the urge. I'm still clean 18 days now :)
selfharm,fmqqv8k,t3_fwvqe2,1586305109.0,"thank you for your wonderful comment.  I have so much going on right now.  My illnesses( permanent) mothers potentially got 2ndry cancer, lots of other shite. I'm 32 and feel like the world is literally on my shoulders.   I'm trying so hard to let the hours go.. I've got heavy metal blasting.  it's now  1.20 am.  I'm sooo close!!"
selfharm,fmq0l6o,t3_fwqz3r,1586290704.0,"I guess i'm kind of similar, I take photos of a fresh cut.  And look back on it.  But I usually end up deleting it in case someone else sees it."
depression,flqelp6,t3_fq000h,1585391475.0,Your doing better than me then. I've managed to kill 2 sims so far. One drowned after I left her to her own devices and the other I tried to get put out a fire and died ðŸ˜‘
depression,fkqtx55,t3_fjthj0,1584455456.0,"Feeling the same.  I was starting to make progress with my physcologist. Then someone close to my family died, mum may have cancer back (scan on sat) and now all this with the virus.   
Feels like the world is out to get me."

selfharm,fk4i23w,t3_fg5z9p,1583860869.0,Only made small cut on top of wrists. Prefer higher up arms and legs.
selfharm,fk18tlx,t3_fftl3h,1583774745.0,I highly recommend a book called Healing the Hurt Within by Jan Sutton for anyone wanting to understand and even for those who need support.

StopSelfHarm,fjgl11h,t1_fjgkj0i,1583329561.0,"I've deflected her questions each time she asked, but next session we'll be talking about it. I suffered abuse so. I'm really anxious though, as I only reached out to these as I went on a 10 weeks pain course and built up trust. If I don't trust someone I won't talk. :("

depression,fj9z8ja,t3_fc0hoy,1583163007.0,"I do. Not on meds for either as I am on so many for other things, I dont want anymore. They just add more side effects.

I use fidget tools like a tangle, spinner and cube. You can get them on amazon. 
I also do Yoga and QiGong to help calm me and stop me thinking about things.

I'm also seeing a psychologist, who has been helping."

Bought a load of beer and vodka, shouldn't but other than circling round my tiny bedsit getting wound up i'm just going to shoot some shit on Destiny 2 and drink ."
depression,fj230kc,t3_fasw5r,1582933292.0,"I am feeling exactly the same.  Only 1 of my friends know I harm and was so disappointed, a couple of other friends think i'm  just having a 'low patch' apart from that it's just me and my psychologist.    
I know my family and close friends would be devastated, but I don't want to live like this anymore.  Had it far to long and I believe it's contributed to my physical problems now.

I have no motivation to do anything, everything feels like a chore.  And I feel numb and have my brain screaming at me to harm.  Sick of it all."
selfharm,fj1bj00,t3_fat897,1582916633.0,"I love tattoos, have several (inc a lighthouse & curled up skeleton - what I call my Fibro skelly) .  Never heard of this meaning, really like the idea."

I guess it depends on why your doing it.  I did it deliberately to be able to harm in public.

Or if you are doing it out of habit."
depression,fj19hk4,t3_farc3n,1582915424.0,"Wow, you just described me, I didn't realise there was a word for feeling being in that kind of state.

I don't have the motivation either, I've packed in nearly all of my hobbies, I don't want to go out anywhere or see/talk to anyone (except my therapist)

I just want the thoughts and feelings of numbness and harming to stop."
selfharm,fiob11c,t1_fio9vg8,1582579753.0,"Thx, i'm really trying. I'm reading a book called 'Healing the hurt within' by Jan Sutton. Hard going (I can't concentrate well) but really is an eye opener, recomend it to self harmers  , plus seeing her and I feel calm when i'm there.

I've always been a 'casual' cutter.
Like I cut and then feel ok for a couple of years, then I go through it again, and repeat.
But recently it's been bad. I think it's because i'm talking about everything and need a release where normally i've bottled everything."
selfharm,fio9ewu,t1_fio8fif,1582578863.0,"Thx. I'm . Seeing psycologist,  and she wants me to she trauma psychologist. Never seen doc abt it. Never spoke abt it till I saw psychologist through pain clinic, 10 week course, got to trust them. Thats a huge problem for me. If my mother ever found out I would be disowned. So i'm really reluctant. 

I'm treating my cuts like I woild a tattoo. So far no probs. But if they did arise I would see a doc. :) 
So far i'm 10 days without cutting. The urges have been bad but i've been using apps (calm halm, headspace, moodfit and reddit threads) they've helped me not give in :)"

selfharm,fintzcg,t3_f8vblp,1582570128.0,"I've not been, I just deal with them myself, but the last 2 times I've cut, 3 or 4 of them were rather deep, I found a new blade and didn't realise how deep and easy it cut.  I'm treating them the best I can, but in hindsight, I should have got them stitched, But I don't want anyone else finding out about it.  
They're going to scar no doubt but so far they aren't infected."
depression,fintc92,t3_f8pwhx,1582569757.0,"So true, but I think people just don't understand.  I told my best mate last week I am really struggling, I just need some support and she literally said she didn't know what to say and changed the subject.  Like she was embarrassed."
depression,fi4wg19,t3_f6ag6t,1582149814.0,doesn't your teeth/jaw hurt?  I can't go more than 2 days without brushing mine.  It feels like a chore (especially with fatigue) but feels better :)
selfharm,fi4nno3,t3_f68me2,1582144831.0,"Yup! happening right now.  Small thing appartently (just ranted to someone, they shrugged it off), but to me it's a big thing - being 'ignored' or 'forgotten' by friends. 

First thought was to rage quit the game i'm playing  and go cut. (they are online, we were scheduled to all play together, they've done it without me...  Gaming is my social life since I have Chronic Pain & Fatigue, I don't get out much.)

They urge is so strong right now, Trying to resist, I have my psychologist session next Thursday and I don't want anymore cuts on my body."
teenagers,fi4a6my,t3_f5fbyy,1582137069.0,"I used to cut the tops of my arms as I'm always wearing band shirts no-one ever noticed.  Now I have tattoos covering the scars, recently I did my lower arms, it's winter so I've just worn long sleeves or hoodies.  Most recent was on my legs - hide with socks, But I went abit mad and have a lot more than normal to now try and hide. x\_x  


i'm now 32, I've hidden mine for years. no-one knows apart from the therapist I recently started seeing."
selfharm,fi493fx,t3_eyso0c,1582136443.0,"I don't feel any pain when cutting.  This will sound weird but I like the feeling on the blood flowing..  It's like all my pent up emotions are released and flow away in the blood.   
I feel good afterwards."
