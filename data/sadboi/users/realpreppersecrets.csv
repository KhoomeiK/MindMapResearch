Had a date with a girl. Went to shit. She was shy, didn't respond much and didn't exactly keep the conversation going. Not only that, but she also didn't look half as attractive in real life as on her photos. 

She then proceeded to say that ***she*** didn't feel any chemistry between us. 

Anyway, I failed largely today and got rejected. By someone I didn't even find attractive. Do I cry over that? No! Rise up and move onwards to the next. Another failure means one more step towards the end goal.
