aromantic,fqpxlsk,t1_fqkj4wm,1589555825.0,"as an aro woman who's had plenty of sex, this just isn't true. not to mention i have plenty of allo friends who've had casual sex with people they have zero emotional connection to and they enjoyed it just fine. so this is possibly true for many women (and men as well) but is definitely not an objective truth for the entire gender."
aromantic,fqpwtwz,t3_gjau52,1589555427.0,"sexual attraction and the list of people you've had sex with don't have to be related at all. and that's still true if the list is blank. i didn't have my first sexual experience with another woman until i was 23, but have known i'm bisexual/queer since i was 11. in the midst of that i dated a guy for 4 years, so of course everyone assumed i was straight. but my attraction to more than one gender never changed.

there were definitely times when i was having the same thoughts and doubting myself. i felt like a ""fake"" bisexual because i'd only ever been with men, but that was more from a lack of options in same sex partners. it made me feel like a fraud, but i'd just remind myself that my sexuality is mine to define.

i have a friend who, when we first met, would ask how i knew for sure i was bi if i'd only ever been with men. the question felt dumb to me though because i'd known it even before i'd been with either. she was like ""what if you sleep with a woman and hate it?"" well, i've definitely had experiences with men that were less than satisfactory but it didn't magically turn me into a lesbian. i'm attracted to what i'm attracted to. the physical act of sex is just an extension of that, not a necessity.

the physical part will happen (if you want it to). you're still young! if you are attracted to men and women and feel that bisexual is the label you most relate to, then that's what you are and it's 100% valid."
Dogtraining,fqfjssp,t3_g5gh2p,1589326172.0,"i have this same issue! my dog has always been a jumper but i let her know very early on that jumping on me would get her nothing but ignored. same for my mom. the problem is she's not that big (about 25 lbs) so when we have visitors, their first reaction is ALWAYS ""oh, i don't mind."" there are even a few who actively encouraged it (had to tell a friend he wouldn't be allowed to visit anymore if he was gonna do that). everyone thinks it's so cute until they realize she can jump to eye level and lick you in the mouth!

if you have a friend who's willing to help, have them come by and knock or ring the bell and then refuse to interact with the dog until he sits a few times. in my case at least, that did away with 99% of the jumping. after that, it was just a matter of keeping out people who were working to undo all my training. encouraging visitors to ignore the dog if he's not behaving properly is important. the problem at that point is how much harder humans are to train than dogs."
BPD,fko3uiq,t1_fknjgyo,1584379587.0,"this is the first time i've ever had it happen with mdma, but i did it every day for like 6 straight days. not sure what i was expecting. the worst of the depression finally passed but my brain just hasn't felt...right, since. like everything is a little off. it feels like super intense dissociation/derealization, but at a certain point it was so bad i was convinced it had to be something more. that's when i started to form this idea that i wasn't in my world and that everything around me was fake. when i talked to ppl about it they thought i was joking (it's the kind of weird thing i'd joke about tbh) but it just frustrated me that no one was listening, which then turned into me suspecting them of being ""in on it.""

so i've definitely calmed down the drug use. was completely sober for a couple weeks, aside from some drinks. haven't touched mdma since and frankly i'm not rushing to try it again. i never considered cutting out nicotine but i'll give it a try!"

i've talked with my therapist about it a bit and i'm sure it varies from person to person   
but in my case, it's related to the fact that i wasn't given the space to express myself growing up. stuff like that was actively discouraged or mocked in my family. at a certain point it probably did become a defense mechanism"
BPD,fk7e9q9,t3_fgwfuh,1583934588.0,i've been going through something similar lately. i just want to say you're not alone. feel free to pm me if you need to vent or even just wanna talk about something totally unrelated as a distraction
BPD,fk7e12l,t3_fgx1fy,1583934438.0,"i've always felt like just being in a therapist's office suddenly ""cures"" me, as in i suddenly have zero recollection of ever being more than just a little sad sometimes lol. writing stuff down as i remember it helps. just using the notes app in my phone to make notes about things i want to mention (i have to do the same thing for physical health issues as well). the hard part is remembering to write it down when i'm having the thought but after a while, it becomes a habit.

when i was trying to get a diagnosis, i specifically requested paper assessments. they took forever (i took 3 of them, 200-400 questions each) but they were all either true/false or multiple choice and ask things like ""i feel x often"" or ""i react in x way"" and you have to rank to what degree you can relate to the statement. this made things soooo much easier for me. this way was also a lot easier because even when i do have the answer to a question, sometimes the answer is too embarrassing and i can't even say it out loud or put it into words.

of course after my results came back, my therapist still had a lot of questions for me but the results gave her a starting point to ask more pointed questions as opposed to the general ""tell me about a time when you experienced some depression"" type of stuff."

BPD,fjoanjz,t3_feig89,1583523948.0,not HIV but sometimes i wish i was diagnosed with some chronic illness. i always feel sick anyway but it's probably just from lack of taking care of myself so nobody takes it seriously. if i was diagnosed with something like cancer at least i'd get sympathy. only getting up to shower once a week would be a triumph because i'd be so brave & strong instead of just gross and lazy. i'd have a valid reason not to work and people would fall over themselves taking care of me and i'd get to chill in the hospital eating jello and watching daytime TV.

BPD,fjla706,t3_fchcme,1583442903.0,"i struggle with this a lot too, what's worked for me is writing my journal like a story. the main character is an obvious self-insert but with a different name. whenever i'm feeling some type of way i start writing random scenes of her life. it started as a way for me to try to describe the concept of an fp to the person who was mine at the time; so instead of telling them, i wrote a short story about a girl who has a new fp. now when i'm in a mood, i just imagine this character is also in a mood while she's doing whatever. i also have this irrational fear of my journal being read but this helps to alleviate some of that because on the off chance that does happen, the whole thing just reads like a story.

the worst part is the hate. i wish i could just be numb to it. now instead of obsessively loving everyone, all i can think about is how much i wish they hurt like i do

but i don’t think that’s the case this time?? i mean i was clearly lashing out when i told her not to try to support me but this came like two days after i was so messed up i blacked out. i was apparently texting this friend during this. she texted me a couple days later to ask if i was still alive and if i’d made it home (i did, along with my car, but zero memory of how). i was already a bit pissy with her and from feeling so shitty physically so i know i wasn’t being very nice that day. i made a comment about my suicidal ideation (not threatening, just acknowledging it) and she responded that she’d rather i not do it bc she’s selfish but that if i want to anyway she’ll still love me. 

you’re probably right about the wedding planning and giving me space. idk if that changes all the shitty things that happened beforehand. idk if my anger is justified or if i did this all to myself and now i have to lie in the bed i made :/ btw sorry i replied all this i just don’t know reddit v well so i’m not sure how to dm"

one of the many problems with coke is that the amount of time you spend fantasizing about your next high gets shorter and shorter to the point that as you're doing it, you're already planning your next trip to the bathroom. but there's something kind of......ceremonial about the whole process."
BPD,feo3agd,t3_eq478x,1579294584.0,"i think i can actually pinpoint the exact moment lol. i was 5-6, just returned from vacation with my mom and little brother (1-2 yrs) visiting my grandfather in florida. my mom's friend picked us up from the airport. my mom brought my brother's and my suitcases inside, sat me on the couch with my brother in my lap, turned the TV on, told me to tell my dad she was leaving, and got back in her friend's car (i actually didn't remember this til a couple years ago when my dad made a comment and i was lost). 

ok so it's unlikely that that one moment is what did it but i feel like that was the start of it. i truly have memories of us being close and spending lots of time together before that. also after she came back, i remember spending a lot of time with her. eventually they got an actual divorce and she got primary custody, and she got married to the guy she'd been cheating with for years - in my memory, this is when things really changed. for pretty much the rest of my childhood, she was always either out partying or was too hungover to get out of bed. when she did get up, she would always hang out with my older stepsister. she even once told me i was too young to be fun and she preferred spending time with my sister. she also constantly made fun of anything i liked and would either get angry at me or laugh in my face when i showed any kind of negative emotion as a kid.

tl;dr my mom abandoned me, reappeared, and proceeded to either straight up ignore me or belittle every thought and feeling i ever had for the remainder of my childhood. i'm no mental health professional, but that's my best guess."
