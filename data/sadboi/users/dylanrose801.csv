family,f2d2m3c,t3_dcuq62,1570146124.0,I'm in texas right now. I miss Calif so much but I cant afford to go back. You said that you are tall married hair dresser?  Sounds like a nice life.
family,f2d1yiw,t1_f2ct9f2,1570145827.0,I'm glad I made your day. Mine hasn't been great either. I used to live a couple hours from San Diego.  Are you still out there?
family,f2cqno2,t1_f2covv1,1570141332.0,The only one who can make you feel terrible is you. If your sister and dad have a problem  with the way you live your life and your choice to not have kids they are the ones with the problem.  Watch the kids when you want and only when you want
family,f2ci30y,t3_dcuq62,1570138453.0,Nope. Congratulations for sticking up for yourself.
