I am glad to say I (very confidently) did terminate with him. I have reached out to a couple potential new Ts but no one is really accepting new clients right now. Honestly, I have felt very different, a little weird and new, but... better, since leaving him. I'm realizing I have the ability to come up with solutions and plans on my own and sort out my own feelings without needing a therapist to fact check every idea I have. Definitely a new kind of existential confidence.

Thank you again.

EDIT: And less guilty over the thoughts and feelings I have!! I don't have him telling me in sessions (or my omnipresent imagination) that I'm feeling the wrong things or thinking the wrong things.

If you decide at some point that you're not ready for this, that is also your choice to make and you can end the relationship compassionately if it gets to that point. That said, being patient--both with her behaviors as well as with learning more about her--is important, so I'm glad that you see that. Being patient and offering support in seeking professional treatment--again, not pressuring or strong-arming her into getting treatment--is probably the best thing you can do.

r/CPTSD is a community that may be a little better of a fit to try to deepen your understanding, as it differs somewhat from classic PTSD. The book *CPTSD: From Surviving to Thriving* could be helpful for understanding more than just the symptoms profile of CPTSD, but personally I would be kind of uncomfortable if I saw my partner suddenly reading a book about CPTSD, so I would honestly start by being honest and telling her you want to do your best to learn about what she's going through, and ask how best you can do that--again, respecting her agency here.

I respect you for your patience and for willingness to admit you're a little overwhelmed, stick around, and try to learn."

I try to get to bed a little early when I can (but always wake up the same time), workout, get fresh air, not drink too much coffee. But it only helps so much."

The best methods I have that work in the short term are cardio exercise (or even just a long walk to clear my mind) and this lil CBT exercise called the ""should/shouldn't chart."" In the latter in the left hand column you list all the reasons the person you're angry with ""shouldn't have"" done that (""he should have known better, he's not a little child, he's not being fair, he's being selfish, etc."") and in the right hand column... you list all the reasons they ""should have"" done that thing that you're so angry about (""he's human and makes mistakes, he can't know what upsets me unless I tell him, he might be having a bad day, etc."").

I'm still often surprised by how much this takes the sting out of the anger and makes it manageable. If you decide to give it a shot, I hope it works for you!"

The staff community is so uplifting of each other, supportive, and positive. People from all different backgrounds and personalities find their own way of being... just good people. Negativity and exclusion just have no room to thrive. Asking to be switched out or take a break is totally accepted and encouraged and understood.

dpdr,fn34puu,t3_fz0jd5,1586612782.0,"I used to, yes. I'll tell you what worked for me, since it sounds like you're looking for ideas. And that was not to ""stop"" the thoughts, but to ""let go"" of the thoughts. To let the thoughts exist in your mind without fretting over them or engaging with them. Letting go of your grasp on your own thoughts. With time, once you've become comfortable and at peace with those thoughts existing in the space of your mind, not chasing after them, they will eventually lessen and peter out to a great extent.

In case you hadn't guessed already, I did this through daily mindfulness meditation practice. These days I meditate 40-60 minutes every day, but even ten minutes twice every day when I started was a genuine game changer. I had no idea it was possible to feel such mental release and peace, as well as to feel so integrated with my body (exercise and going for walks also helped me with this). I use an app called Headspace, which is awesome and super user friendly. It even has thirty day courses for anxiety, anger, etc. as well as super easy 10 minute walking meditations.

If you're willing to give this a shot, even for just a week, I hope it's helpful."
CPTSD,fmzk5fi,t3_fy33z7,1586522826.0,"My brain always disagrees about whether it's needed self-care, laziness, or a symptom of trauma. I'm doing my best to habituate a few behaviors every two weeks, then move on to new behaviors once I have those down. For me, behaviors become a lot easier once they're habits and I don't have to struggle and think so hard about it. A big trick for me is: If I'm not doing tasks RIGHT now, don't THINK about tasks I have to do. Because that's exhausting in itself."
CPTSD,fmy6t9a,t1_fmxvbe8,1586479360.0,"I believe it is a recognized diagnosis in the DSM-5, but you can have dissociative amnestic defense mechanisms without qualifying for a full diagnosis. Being in fight/flight/freeze mode definitely can make you less aware of what's going on, but typically the mechanism behind the forgetfulness in trauma survivors is your brain deliberately cutting off/hiding memory content. So the memories are all there, your brain just doesn't let you access them, in order to protect you from whatever pain is associated with them."

I did tons of new things and shit on my to-do list with my quarantine time!

Also I beat COVID-19!

I coped with my birthday, which is always one of the hardest days of the year for me.

I put together a detailed budget and have been sticking to it!

Vent:

I feel depersonalized and that sucks ass

On my birthday, I realized I have dissociative amnesia :/ I realized I couldn't remember a single one of my birthdays while I lived at home ages 0-18, save 1-2 flashbulb memories (traumatic ones at that...) Then I realized I can remember next to nothing from school, friendships, vacations, holidays. It's not a total blank slate, there are random memories here and there, but it's enough for me to feel like I'm not a real person with a real life history..."
CPTSD,fmw6ud2,t3_fxgfn6,1586440795.0,"Yes, 100%. Sorry if I'm about to tell you things you already know--I'm just going to tell you what worked for me in case it's helpful to you!

This is where I've found cognitive-behavioral methods to be the most helpful. That's how I got from re-wearing dirty laundry, washing my sheets once per year, having a dirty room, letting dirty dishes pile up, never flossing, to where I am now (being able to do all those things pretty consistently, on time, with little or no hesitation). It's often still hard, even though I've learned and habituated the behaviors. And I still have a lot of important new healthy behaviors to learn in the coming weeks and years.

Methods like behavioral activation, schedules/to-do lists, habit tracking apps (*Done* is great. You just tap the bar every time you complete a behavior and fill it up throughout the week). Those things were game changers for me. But it does take time to learn those behaviors and make them fairly simple habits. Something important for me to remember was push myself, but take it slow. I'm still learning/increasing new behaviors now, but I only try to work on a couple behaviors at a time. So for one two week period I'll use my habit app to target flossing once per day on 4/7 days of the week, getting up at 8am 5/7 days of the week, and going for a run 2 times per week. Then if I meet a target for two weeks in a row, I'll increase the target (e.g. now flossing 6/7 days of the week) or move on to a new behavior to target.

The interesting thing is, you **don't** feel better, THEN exhibit more healthy behavior. It's the other way around, you just kick yourself in the ass (or compassionately encourage yourself) to exhibit more healthy behavior, THEN you feel better. (This is the basic principle of ""behavioral activation,"" you exit depression by doing the behaviors, rather than waiting for depression to lessen in order to start doing behaviors again). You could try finding just 1-2 things you can do every day to start out (e.g. floss, take a walk) and grow from there once you have those behaviors habituated and they no longer feel so overwhelming. You can also have bigger targets, like going to a social event once per week (I was targeting attending a zen group meditation once per week before COVID became a thing).

Once I had the experience of seeing myself learn and habituate a behavior that previously felt impossible, I had the insight: Wow, these behaviors are not that hard once I target them, I am capable of doing them without it draining me. I can learn new behaviors, and if it feels impossible right now, that's only my brain playing tricks on me.

Side note: Daily meditation also helped me by lessening the intensity of those feelings of aversion and also by increasing my general discipline. I like to use the app Headspace!

I hope some of this is helpful, and again sorry if I'm telling you things you already know!"
CPTSD,fmpcz84,t3_fwbzqz,1586278635.0,"Yes!!! I totally blank on so many cultural references like celebrities or movies. It's so obvious that my coworkers and friends pick up on it and we can laugh about it. I actually associate to lots of childhood memories throughout my day, but often it's subliminal and I have to be mindful to pick up on it."
productivity,fmm1wwf,t3_fw2dbx,1586197263.0,"Motivation FOLLOWS discipline. So the first part is building a habit through repetition (discipline) then you start to feel motivated. I use a habit app called Done. Surprisingly helpful. Also helps to find ways to ""refresh"" yourself like working out, meditating, or taking a walk so that you feel ready to sit down and work. Meditation is a sometimes overlooked but (to me) essential practice for building discipline, even 10 minutes a day with the Headspace app makes a huge difference. Also, when making a routine, DON'T overdo it. Start small. Tackle 1-2 goals at a time for 2 weeks, then reassess and add more/higher goals if you're ready."
