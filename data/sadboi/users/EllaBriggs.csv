depression,fb6je9m,t3_ebhs7s,1576551762.0,"Chemical depression doesn't require a reason to be depressed..... No one should discount your depression because you're only 14.  Please ignore those who comment differently, those are simply ignorant comments.  Actually the fact the it's beginning so young is concerning as this could potentially become worse with early onset.  But you also have the opportunity to get tested early and learn to manage it because you are young.  I want diagnosed until much later and unfortunately looking back I spent so many years reacting to myself not knowing why I felt so off."
depression,faw275y,t3_eaic77,1576364943.0,"When we are depressed and feeling this way about ourselves... Looking for a relationship is the last and worst thing we should ever do.  Our judgment is skewed.  We put out the wrong vibe and will attract the wrong kind of partner.  The kind that will only use and abuse a kind and good heart.  Another person will not fix us...we must first heal our depression and anxiety... Be in a good place in order to find love..... Only then can we find a keeper... Who will love us through our episodes as we know they will return.  And only a person who truly loves us can weather those storms.  But that's also a tall order.... At 44 I've accepted that my life is likely to be lived as a single person.... With the exception of my wonderful and true companion, my dog.  Only my parents have loved me unconditionally...my siblings have not.  Such is life.... This is the selfish worlds we live in.  I would rather be alone than be with someone who uses me."

mentalhealth,f3zluri,t1_f3z5liz,1571271999.0,"I'm so sorry that you have been through so much already.  You are absolutely entitled and justified in how you feel.  What's important is you, taking care of you from here on out.  You do what's right for your mental health and happiness now and in the future.  I highly recommend getting into therapy and or some good self help healing books at the very least.  They have robbed you of enough by not providing you a loving, safe environment to grow up in.  Please do not let them take your future from you too.   Forgive and move on.  Sometimes forgiving means letting go and leaving."

depression,f3nhj7i,t3_dh9gr5,1570998176.0,"Watch  Big Bang Theory.....you might relate to the characters and they all do just fine as they mature.

Women in  their 20s are immature with no idea of what makes for a great partner.  Take your time... Finish school, get your career established.  Your time will come and when it does no crazy relationship will derail your life.  You will be able to attract good quality women... Good marriage partners if that is what you truly want.  Meanwhile many of your friends who married in their 20s will be going through their first divorces. 
Trust me, it's better to wait for your time than rush into it... You'll only find misery.
I'm 44, grateful to be single.  I married in my 20s...to the wrong man.  I've watched friends live in miserable marriages because of children and  financial obligations.  But the way, those marriages from what I've been told go years on end wothout sex!!  I feel very lucky to not be stuck.  Be patient, do your thing and what you enjoy.  It's then that you will  find your counterpart because it will be a natural fit.
Just be your best self. 
FYI sexual inexperience is so much better than hooking up with a walking std.  Plus men and women who treat sex so casually also lose the sense of intimacy which bonds partners.   You learn and grow sexually together with your partner."
