COVID19positive,fq8gb8r,t3_ghb1x0,1589165548.0,sometimes people feel sick but they cant get tested so they assume they have symptoms of the virus and its understandable. i tested negative a few weeks ago after getting sick with Pneumonia. i use to have symptoms but i dont anymore. i had lingering symptoms but that is all gone. i was told by my doctor that it would be a good idea if i get a antibody test because the doctor said the covid-19 swap is 60 percent not accurate. the antibody test will actually show if i had it. the covid test only gives you results of that moment. so im waiting for my results from the antibody testing. i assume i had it because i never in my life had a pneumonia. the test results will show me the truth and im waiting for it

COVID19positive,fop7skv,t3_g8lbil,1587954997.0,"you are right but then again you never know. i suffer from panic attacks and anxiety PTSD. so panic attacks is nothing new to me. i also have a panic disorder. i worry about everything. when i notice something on my arm that i never payed attention to before i get anxiety and think its bad. i start to feel nervous and scared.  that's one quality i hate about myself. but you are right stress and anxiety could also affect ones health. i remember i was having constant panic attacks (right now i feel one coming and im trying to control it) after my panic attacks the chest pain lingers. when you have a panic attack and feel scared it feels as if your chest is about to explode. but a few weeks ago i was having bad chest pain and i thought it was the lingering affect of my panic attack. i was also having uncontrollable chills and headache. . i gave it one day but the pain got worse. chills and headache continued.  i went to the ER. they took CT scan EKG and blood. they said they found left basilar pneumonia and i was shocked. they said that could be due to covid-19 or it could be a regular pneumonia. i never in my life had a pneumonia. only chest pains but they never found anything in the past. so my point is that sometimes its not anxiety. you could actually be sick., i believe once covid-19 is gone and theres a vaccine and everything goes back to normal that could make people with anxiety and panic attacks feel better. you need to be really good to train your mind and know whats anxiety and whats not. i cant really tell the difference. look at me i was told i had mild covid-19."

Frugal,fjh41tx,t1_fjgy33a,1583340826.0,Before you go around trying to insult peoples grammar how about you educate yourself on being a nice person!! I never learned grammar in school because I had a rough childhood and dealing with a abusive father and moving place to place with my mother trying to get away from him. School wasn’t the main focus in my life. It was trying to survive and get away from my father. Not everyone was born into a privileged life or the perfect family. Not everyone was born smart and intelligent. I have a learning disability therefore i have a hard time understanding things. The point to my story is think before going around insulting people grammar because you don’t know shit. There’s a reason why some people are the way they are. You don’t know anyone’s story. If you can’t answer a question ignore it. 
friendship,fiyh5yz,t1_fixd5aa,1582839328.0,i told her already today. i told her its best we not talk anymore. if we need to talk it needs to be in class and about school work. i told her i cant ignore the signs. she constantly cancels plans and she ignored my text when i messaged her from my new number. she didnt acknowledge my text. all she gave was excuses saying she dont have time to look at her phone. i made it easy for her so she wont have to pretend like she likes me and continue to talk to me. i told her all that. she just agreed with me. i deleted her number from my phone and moved on.  im just hoping she dont talk to me in class again. she had a opportunity to be fiends but you need boundaries with people. if you dont set bounderies they will continue doing the same.  thanks again

Constipation,fin8c4n,t1_fim95yd,1582558116.0,im wondering that same thing.i feel dried up.i cant create a stool. it wasnt necessary for me to take the prep because i was already dried up. this symptom came along with my prostatitis. im trying to be smart and see doctors hoping if i fix one then another gets away. i have the test results as proof which showed notghing is wrong. but i was hoping they find something because i hate being constipated.
Prostatitis,fijb5zd,t1_fiihlvy,1582440493.0,my urologist was giving me a muscle relaxer (diclofenac dr) and tried ibprofen. didnt work. for the infectiuon he gave me levofloxacin and penicillin vk) those didnt work. the bacteria went then came back. right now he gave me  elmiron which he said will start working after 1-2  months. he said the bacteria is causing the pain. it keeps coming and going. those medicne he gave me dont sound like ones that doctor properly use to treat these symptoms. he seems to be giving me ones that dont work. who gives ibuprofen for prostatitis. the pain is unbearble at times. im afraid one day this will cause me to need a catheter. i had one in the past. its no fun
Prostatitis,fijapl6,t1_fig15fc,1582439992.0,my doctor did a cystoscopy as well. he didnt find anything. the first urologist i went to. but he never took semen samples. my current urologist took seman samples and found it that way. im sorry your going through this too.

Instagram,f7ors8k,t1_f7ormt9,1573932779.0,1 photo every two days is not spamming. And that’s what’s Instagram is for to post. If I were spamming that’s not against the rules. I’m not spamming anything inappropriate
