TooAfraidToAsk,fopfn26,t3_g8hydz,1587960258.0,"I've seen it as a technicality.  Technically, to solve one's own problems by removing yourself from reality is selfish. It doesn't take into account everyone else you will affect.

From my own life I've been close, I've had the gun in my mouth, and the knife at my wrist on separate occasions,  but it's been the unwillingness to put others through the suffering of my loss that has saved me.  I'm thankful now, because I stumbled upon what was ultimately causing my depression (gender dysphoria).

I can't speak for anyone but myself. As for the other half of your statement, I see that as just as selfish.  

My misery had a source, and I was able to work through it.  When those who love me wanted me to continue it wasn't just for the sake of sadness.  Sometimes, the most unlikely of people admire you and look up to you. I've seen suicide beget suicide because life was unlivable without each other. I'm alive because I leaned on those who also needed me.

Again, I can't speak for anyone else, that's just my answer to your question. Best of luck"

From someone who has dealt with suicidal depression of my own it's not your fault.  She may have blamed you, but it's not your fault. She had much more going on behind the scenes than anyone knew. 

 Also, shame on every single person who blames you.  That's one of the most fucked up things someone can do in this situation.  Suicide begets suicide in some places.  If you think you need help, get it. Don't let this nag at you for years to come. You're worth the time and life is too precious to go through it miserable.  I wish you the best and good luck"
