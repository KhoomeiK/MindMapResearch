Business_Ideas,fqxb101,t3_glg3kf,1589729222.0,"I think it’s a nice idea to collect influencers/accounts so you can find new one in your niche. But paying people to follow I think isn’t. If you pay someone for doing something which doesn’t take any time or effort, you’ll soon find people taking advantage of that. Meaning, people will only use the app to make money and not in the way you want. Bots will be swarming.

Plus, social media platforms do their utmost to prevent this (paid followers, follow for follow etc) from happening so I don’t think you’d be in favor with them and, possibly, it’s not even legal. Also, credible influencers don’t want paid followers, as they don’t engage and engagement is the currency, so it won’t do them that good.

Sorry if I’m negative, as I said, I think the idea of gathering influencers to discover new ones within your interest is a great idea! Best of luck to you 🌞"

WeightLossAdvice,fqqeqn8,t3_gkan4y,1589564251.0,"Not everyone’s hunger signals are correct, if you’ve had a habit of overeating or restricting then those signals are in a frenzy. But once you’ve started eating proper portions of real, nutritious food on a regular time schedule for a longer time, then you’re signals start to become correct and you can trust them. Plus, if you eat dinner and start to feel hungry right after, it’s usually because you didn’t eat well enough during the day.

At least, that’s what my therapist tells me 🙃

Edit: I don’t know why I get notifications from this subreddit. I’m in treatment for an ED and is in no way fit to join in on conversations here 😅 But I read this and have issues with my own hunger signals, so I thought I’d chime in."

EatingDisorders,fq00myp,t3_ggd0ai,1589026356.0,"Body Positive Power by Megan Crane has helped me a lot! She talks about her experience with anorexia. But also, the history of diet culture and why we think the way we think about beauty, and that made a lot of difference for me! That we find skinny beautiful because a bunch of men in the 50s wanted to make money and started telling women to buy their shit so they would become skinny, made me realize that it’s not natural or biological to find it more attractive (I.e. it’s not the ‘right’ thing). It’s something we’ve learned. So the best way to get over it is to unlearn that and not put any value in bodies as a thing to be inspected and judged.

My second tip is to follow people on Instagram with different sizes, age, gender etc. I feel that when I get exposed to people who don’t look like the ‘norm’ and love their bodies, it helps a great deal. If I only follow white, skinny girls, it’s easy to believe that that’s how everyone look.

EatingDisorders,fpntvxq,t3_geh0u8,1588772498.0,"I lost A LOT of weight when my ED was at its worst. Everyone commented on it and I didn’t understand what they were talking about, I couldn’t see any difference. Yes, the scale told me I had lost a significant amount of weight but when I looked in the mirror I saw no changes at all. Now that I’ve gained the weight back, and then some, I can see the difference clear as day when I look back at pictures. How thin my upper arms and thighs were, the shallowness in my face, hip and collarbones protruding. But truly, when I looked like that I didn’t see it AT ALL, not even when I tried and thought ‘see through the ED and see how you actually look’. But I just effin couldn’t.

I think perhaps it’s something our dysmorphic minds do. The ED wants you to keep on loosing weight so it won’t ever say ‘yes, you are now thin and we can stop this thing we’re doing’. But when, like me, you gain the weight back and look at a picture of how you used to look the ED is like ‘loooook at how thin we are!! We need to look like that again’. It does whatever it can to convince you to be unhealthy. And that’s why it is never our friend."

EatingDisorders,fpcwhm9,t3_gco3on,1588514507.0,"1. Eating disorders are not about the food we eat or don’t eat or what we weigh or look like, it’s about how much mental energy you put thinking about food (what you want to eat, can’t eat, shouldn’t eat but did, when you’re going to eat next, etc) and the anxiety around it
2. It’s a mental illness and can’t be fixed by something physical, because, again, it’s not about the food or the weight
3. People without eating disorders stop their dieting when they reach their target weight, we do not. We keep going until we die or get help
4.  If you could, you would stop restricting and binging (because you know it causes you harm and there are tons of other things you could spend your time and energy on) but you can’t because. you. have. an. eating disorder.

You deserve to be happy and healthy. You deserve to get help so you can beat this. YOU DESERVE IT."

2. He should acknowledge he can’t possibly know how you feel and what you’re capable of doing when you’re in pain. If my bf suggest doing yoga or whatever and I say “I can’t even get out of bed”, THEN THAT’S THAT.

3. He should take you seriously and make you feel seen, understood and loved. If he doesn’t do that, then sayonara."
bulimia,ey3of8v,t3_cvbuyf,1566769521.0,"Seems like you’re taking on a lot, all that would be stressful even for someone without and ED!

My suggestions:

1.	Why don’t you go to class? Analyze and find ways to get around, if you can. For example: Can’t concentrate? Just show up to get attendance, talk to your teachers etc.
2.	Do you really need a part-time job to survive? Or should you take that time to focus on yourself?
3.	Do you need to “excel”? I find that many of us with EDs demand perfection which drives anxiety which fuels the ED. Why can’t passing be enough?

I believe in you! You just have to be nice to yourself and lower your expectations for what is possible with your ED."

I haven’t had a single drag since the day I quit (going on 4 years now) and I LOVE that. I am so proud of myself for finally quitting. But on bad days when all I can think of is food and my anxiety is running mad, I remember how I used to live on just Coke and cigarettes. So I start thinking if maybe I just smoke one a day... NO!!! It took so much effort quitting. It’s costly. It’s damaging for your health and the environment. You want to recover. Creating new bad habits to help with existing bad ones is NOT THE ANSWER.
