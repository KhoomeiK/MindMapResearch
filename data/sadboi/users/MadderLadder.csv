 Because the government is definitely against changing the parts of the system that keeps people sleeping in hospitals and elderly working to survive, while some shower in money.

Please I would love to hear of a better way, because I am blind to it from my hope being broken docens of times by politicians and the law forgiving people with money. 

And as I said, the injured from protests are a much tinier number than the injured from cops. 

And many people protesting don't want to injure bystanders, but many times cops just attack places of reunion too, without caring for who's in it. In the Forestal park for example, I have helped kids and mothers because cops just wanted to throw a tear gas grenade near the place they play even when the protest or the people figthing wasn't there or near it. 

As son of a tortured father and a public teacher mother, I have seen my fair share of peaceful protests in my life, and I have seen my mother getting beaten and taken to jail from it. 
Nearly nothing more has been gained from them.

If you search real data and protewt videos, you'll see that even when we have had opportunities to kill cops in protests, we don't do it because most of us value life. We have had cops at our feet, crawling away, and instead of killing them or leaving them with broken bones, we let them go alive. 

That's why there aren't any dead cops in protests here, or even a cop that lost an eye. Not even one. 

Compare that to the more than 1000 cases of torture or the more that 300 eyes lost because of bad use of equipment by cops. No punishment to any of those cops by the way. 

We are no saint and we don't claim to be, but violence is the only way now. After more than 20 years of peaceful protests and injustice and deaf ears, what other road do we have?

The ONU and other international organizations doesn't do shit, the human rights are just toilet paper to the governments and violence is used everyday by the cops against us.

How can we survive without using it?

And I repeat we are not saints, but we are figthing for our elderly and our tortured fathers and brothers, at least we use violence with a good reason behind it, not because we took some cocaine and want to blow some eyes away and beat some teens.

iamatotalpieceofshit,fjlnem9,t1_fjk54z4,1583450167.0,"20 years ago it was redacted in a small way really, and not taking into account many problems.
And as many say, there has never been a revolution without violence, and we have protested for years without being listened to. 

What do we do then if without violence noone listens? What other road do we have? My mother is a teacher and she's been in protests for more than 15 years, nearly no change for them, they still receive a shit pay and still receive a retirement money that is not enough to live. 


And you can't really compare the violence of more than 35 deaths, hundreds of eyes shot, rapes, torture and more, and the violence of breaking a street to have rocks to throw at cops, or making people dance to pass in a car. Or a supermarket burnt, that can be rebuilt, an eye or a family not. 

And please don't say that they died because they were delincuents, many where just going home or walking and tried to stop cops doing something or just were beating a pot and singing about how we will win in the end. 

Is that enough reason to kill someone? Or to take their vision away? 

And another point, cops who kill or leave people beaten to shit just have to sign every 2 weeks and not go outside the country and that's when there is a lot of evidence. Please show me one cop in jail for killing someone or for leaving a 15 years old girl in a coma to this day. 

And on the other side, there is a student who's been in jail for months for moving a piece of rock from the ground. There are hundreds of people in jail for being in a place protesting peacefully, cops are known for claiming you have weapons and shit and the justice always believes them, and doesn't give a true punishment when they are found to be lying. 


The problem is many times deeper than the person who commented this believes or wants to make othee believe, the many people killed and left blind or tortured can't just reach an agreement if there isn't real justice. 

Can someone argument really how we can be at peace when the police kills our brothers and the justice keeps silent? 

What can we do other than fight and keep the memory of the loved ones they took alive and strong? 

Why should we just accept it as normal and move on? 

Do we have to kill our empathy and our care for the ones who have less? 

Do we have to kill the ones who sleep outside hospitals so we don't feel bad when we look at them? Because we aren't giving any solution to them and since killing is normal and acceptable for some, why don't go all out? 

Kill the poor who live in the street, kill the mentally diabled, kill anyone who dares raise their voice. Kill the women who protest for being raped, kill the mothers who protest for the freedom of their family, kill me because I will never stop trying to help my brother in pain. I hate the no-value of life in the eyes of some and will never let it take control over my soul."

And yeah, they act like monsters and cowards most of the time honestly, attacking health volunteers, injured people, students and people with disabilities in any protest and ganging up and beating anyone who falls. I'm sure that without cocaine they are just as violent and shit. 

They fucking shot multiple times at the doctor trying to keep the man who fell in Plaza Dignidas alive, that's plain evil."

A video thst was leaked yesterday, shows how a military patrol car chased and killed someone protesting. Fucking monsters. Graphic content."

Pinochet was really stupid too, in the papers of the CIA it says he had some case of mental slowness, didn't read and was easily manipulable. 

Maybe Piñera is the same, Israel is selling the cops watershooting cars and ""skunks"", that's for sure."
pics,fjimpqh,t1_fjim5ro,1583371026.0,"True, it would be a very bad move to take credit for this. I believe Trump said something but we know how he is, he says many things and none true or smart at least.

It will happen someday if the eternal war continues, the military enterprise needs death and someone will take revenge sooner or later.

And it happens here too, some say Pinochet was good and they too share the blood for choosing not to see the horrible stuff that happened."
pics,fjik3jo,t1_fjiiqem,1583369391.0,"Honestly the US is silent as far as I can see, but Piñera seems to like Trump, both are a bit of a hateful clown.

 I believe the US is mostly silent because all this neoliberal system comes from the involvement of the US in the attack to the presidency of Salvador Allende. The years of torture and killings are still there and they still hurt, and it's proven that it happened because of the meddling hand of another country.

Being honest, many hate the US with a passion and see it as the evilest shit ever, like the big villain in the movie. Not too many but still there is some hate for the gringos. 

For me, from years of learning and consuming american culture, I can see that it wasn't the people, it was the government. So I'm not going to hate someone for something their government did."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fjijcoo,t1_fjiiu9p,1583368918.0,"Yeah, it's a nearly daily fight and cops attack directly to the knees so you need to be well equipped or at least covering the vital parts. 

Most shields are tv antenna for cable modified or street materials, but many buy or donate materials to heal or to protect themselves. Masks, shields or kneepads, there is even an old man who works with leather and offers free eyepatches to people who lost an eye from cops attacks."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fjihfdm,t3_fdkgm7,1583367698.0,"Update: 

A dog was killed yesterday from a tear-gas grenade shot by a cop. 

There's a very graphic video on Instagram.

Also, 2 dogs died days ago because cops leave the parks and streets full of tear gas and the dogs ate a bit of grass and got sick from the tear gas and other chemical particles in it.

Also, they started adding caustic acid again to the water-shooting vehicle, in november we had hundreds of people burnt badly and it was proven that the water used had dangerous quantities of caustic acid. 

Obviously, nothing happened from it, no legal actions, nothing. Taking into consideration that this can and is considered a chemical weapon. They use tear gas from the dictatorship times too, expired as hell and more toxic than the new ones. 

Also, there have been 2 videos leaked, one of a military car ramming someone intentionally and another one of a bunch of cops torturing a 14 years old teen after arresting him, I could find both on Instagram or Facebook if anyone wants to see the evidence, I don't wanna watch it again really."
pics,fjigqkd,t1_fjidueo,1583367263.0,"Many thanks for the kind words, the fear and spirit crushing despair when seeing the violence and damage to common people, many times younger, can get to you sometimes. 

I got a pellet in the bone below the eye, the feeling of imagining never looking again for a couple of seconds when it hit it's something I'll never forget. 

I stopped going to protests for a while after that, but these days the students of high school (15 to 18 years old) started classes and that meant massive evasions in subways in protest, streets cut and massive escapes from classes and more, the young are strong and they fight against drugged up ""men"" with armor and lethal weapons. It's time to come back to help in some way.

These protests has shown us the beautiful in people, the art you can see everywhere is wonderful, the stupid fucks of the government painted over beutiful paintings and posters to force ""normality"" , and guess what?

It was filled with even more art the very next day! It's wonderful. 

And the health volunteers are fucking angels, they are deeo in tear-gas sometimes with a shield helping people, not even throwing rocks and with a laser, only helping people and treating or carrying the hurt to a safe place. 

That's why the cops attack them, they go to help, not to fight. 

They are fucking heroes and saints for me and many. 

I hope this is known outside more, so people at least will point and say ""In Chile the human rights are violated daily."" Sorry for the long text and bad english and thanks again for the nice words, I will protect my life so I can help others, we don't need more martyrs, we have too many already."
pics,fjidsrp,t1_fjiaxyd,1583365466.0,"The photo I posted reminded me a lot of this one. We all know the real bosses are the great enterprises, but still the cop who chooses to shoot at the eyes of his own people is as guilty as anyone."
pics,fjia8er,t1_fji8c4h,1583363358.0,"Exactly, we learnt many techniques from Hong Kong and the coronavirus jusr arrived here too. 

There is a serious consideration of considering Piñera to be medically inept to govern. He's going downhill and will be shown in history books as the worst president in Chilean history; inept, a coward and deaf. He said that women have the fault of giving the appearance to be abused or something like that. Guy's crazy and a murdered and he knows it. 

 I wish HK the best in their fight, I'm sure there have been many deaths over there (or at least disappeared people in concentration camps)."
pics,fji6udl,t1_fji5nig,1583361596.0,"The government is blind to all this, always talking about the burnt subway stations (burnt by cops, there are many videos) and other material things. Not a word about the cops breaking human rights.

We say we are in a dictatorship these days, many deaths, rampant abuse of power and a president with a 3% of approval, so no true democracy over here.

Next, we just keep in figthing for the ones that are not with us and for the ones that will have a future thanks to our blood and sweat. Strikes are few and far between, since many are deep in debt and need to work to live, but students are figthing all over the country, and the 8 there will be a massive women only protest, and a strike for 2 days, and the month continues, every day a new protest and more injuries."
pics,fji381h,t1_fji2a3p,1583359868.0,"Sorry for the bad english.

In Chile there have been protests for more than 4 months, we ask for many things, like justice, health and education, and the cops have been really violent from day one.

More than 400 eyes lost, 30 + deaths, rapes, torture and many other horrible things.

To help in some way, many people volunteer to be there as first aid people, healing and helping anyone who is feeling bad or is injured in any way.

Cops attack them to stop them helping injured people, something that is against international law but they stick that up their asses.

And as we can see on this photo, they are gassed, shot at, beaten and menaced, some women from these health brigades have been sexually attacked by cops too."
pics,fji1qms,t1_fji1koi,1583359110.0,I'm sure they get hot doing this shit. They are used to using sexual violence in any woman they get their hands into in a protests. Fucking disgusting.
