As for cooking, it can absolutely be daunting at first, but here's what I did when my Mum gave me a food budget and started telling me to do my own grocering and cooking in my mid teens:  
Set aside a bit of money from each payment to go towards kitchen equipment; I started out being able to use my parent's things as I was still living with them, but I was aiming to move out already. I bought myself an electric rice cooker that had a couple other functions (though if it had been available then, I would have saved longer and bought myself an instapot for the added functionality; I'm a fan of minimalism for easier relocations and less sq ft = less $$$), I bought myself a large, deep frying pan, a large non stick pot, a silicone flipper and ladle, a large glass baking dish and a silicone non stick mat for it, a high quality metal 8"" chef's knife (which has continued to prove to be the only knife I need; grip it with your thumb and index finger on the base of the blade, past the hilt, and your three fingers gripping the hilt. Keep your other fingers out of the knife's path at all times), plus a sharpener to keep it maintained, and a large, thick hardwood cutting board. And I, personally, bought more mason jars than I ever ended up knowing what to do with. I ended up acquiring as well a small non stick frying pan, which did end up a very useful addition, admittedly.
From there, I would make a lot of simple meals: (pre made sauce) teriyaki chicken and rice with lacto-fermented veggies; (canned) cheddar soup boiled with broccoli, bacon, and carrots; chicken/lean beef, mushrooms, and onions pan fried with cumin/paprika/chili powder/garlic to make taco meat, then coarsely chop some tomato, bell pepper, cilantro, and avocado, and throw it all in wraps with some salsa; Green leafies with tomato/bell pepper/cheese/store-bought pre-cooked BBQ chicken shredded up and some balsamic vinegar tossed into the leaf mix...  

Just be sure to run by a bulk department and give the spices a good sniff... Pick out the ones you like and experiment with adding them to your food by smell. You'll find it closely correlates to how these things taste together.

Yay!), but, frankly, are you and your BPD friends willing to get together and start a private therapy fund for people who've been abused by those with BPD? Because otherwise the people you've decided from your armchair have a personality disorder deserve their fuckin pity party, just like Borderline people throw all the fuckin time."
UnsentLetters,eqa5160,t1_eq8st0n,1559925307.0,"Err, maybe this is just an example to me of one of my social gaps, but I'm 110% not sure what point anyone is supposed to get from being shown pictures of a person's life. The point I pick up from that is that they're trying to intensify the friendship - show me things and people they like to give us things to talk about - not that they want me to bloody bugger off.

Maybe a clear boundary would work better than trying to use vague hints that won't necessarily sound to the other like what you thought you said."
fatlogic,eq9rbi1,t1_eq91iky,1559915900.0,"Y'know, been doing my psych readings lately, been reading up on splitting a la BPD.  
What you described is absolutely the mentality tumblrite FAs have. Fat=bad, me=fat, ergo me=bad. Cue projection like a motherfucker so that in actuality, your fat makes you a GOOD person and it's actually everything else that's wrong, not your reality.  
I wonder how many FAs are BPD, especially taking into account that BPD has major self harm habits - of which binge eating is considered."
UnsentLetters,epzxb1n,t1_epzlq7o,1559674431.0,"In your situation you had a safe enough way to help the harmed animal. I'm glad you did, and thank you. My comment about ""the other guy's morals"" was off-handedly directed at TheHolderOfThree for their particularly callous outlook towards other life.

In my situation, the driver had no way to stop without endangering people further, and I don't feel the need to lay out the exact intricate detailing of why it was unsafe for the driver to stop on my bit of road. It was, and I'm thankful they didn't. Dealing with the kitty after they were hit was godawful, but a heck of a lot better than trying to apply what little first aid I know to a 4 car pile up at midnight."
UnsentLetters,epzbzib,t1_epyzqou,1559662648.0,"Idk about the other guy's idea of morals there, but I had this exactly happen to me on the highway road (not busy at night) that I used to live on, except the poor kitty had no collar. It wouldn't have been safe for the driver to stop. I don't blame them for not stopping, as callous as it may have felt in the moment. An unsafe situation happened and one animal lost their life over it, but there was no need to set up an additional unsafe situation."
BPDlovedones,epm3ez0,t1_epi8k5v,1559307623.0,"Statistically the first person to cry ""abuse"" in any given situation is the most widely believed. I wonder if pwBPD pick up on that subconsciously and start tailoring their behaviour so that they're always the first available anywhere with the tea on offer."

fatlogic,eor2efs,t1_eoqwohi,1558800090.0,"Dude, recently learned I have faulty APOb genes. Read up on the meds - statins.  
I WILL DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO MOT HAVE TO USE THOSE FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. Shit gives you diabetes, kills your liver, and wrecks your muscles (I'm already EDS, too! No!). I can still try controlling it (at this age/stage) through 30-60m of moderate to intense exercise a day, not smoking, and avoiding high cholesterol foods! I'd legit rather go vegan again than swallow down statins. That shit scares me more than my impending heart attacks."

dating_advice,eoovv1k,t1_eooii2w,1558749026.0,I'm sad for you and your rejection of wishing to understand the physical underpinnings of the world around you. I hope you find peace sooner rather than later. I've blocked you for mine.
BreakUps,eooek1o,t1_eo93slo,1558736601.0,"Yes, there are no successful marriages in the world, all women are demons to steal your children and money. You're definitely not attracting poor mates to start with that shitty world view at all!
Your entire statement is an elaborate way of saying ""I don't think I am worth staying with and therefore genuinely believe every woman in the world will leave me"". Get that checked out. Your insecurity probably ruined your last relationship and definitely will ruin your future ones."

How about instead of non consensually enforcing control over another person's property and life, you make yourself fucking appealing enough that they want to give you the time of day? You, personally, might start with therapy. Just a thought."
