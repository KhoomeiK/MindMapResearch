The war on words is as real as the war on womanhood. But no amount of redefining and misconstruing can change the fact that “male” and “female” are based on real biological differences, and have a long standing legal, societal meaning. If you use the word “female” enough in the context of stereotypical femininity and “feelings”, it seems that some people do begin to really confuse biology with feelings. I think this really began when people started off by saying “gender is how you feel!” when “gender” and “sex” have always been synonymous. But now, if you google “gender”, you’ll notice that the definition has changed to mean female or male in the “social sense.” Words are powerful."

It was only three years ago, when I was 16, that my grandma finally told my mom that we'd told her these awful things and that she'd see my dad go into our room/hear us say ""no, no"" on the baby monitor but said NOTHING to my mom because she thought my mom and dad were ""working things out.""

There are too many people in these positions who don't know their ass from their elbow when it comes to mental illness. The moral of the story here is that she sucks at her job and you need to find someone who can actually bring out the best in you. I wish you luck in finding a good psych.
depression,f403xx5,t1_f3zza9f,1571284297.0,"Keep a George Foreman grill next to your bed along with the necessary ingredients. You may accidentally step on the grill, but there's a downside to everything."
Anxiety,f3zc5q8,t3_dirvvk,1571266192.0,I'm going to just start writing down as many details as I can at work because I do the same thing.
Anxiety,f3t0bcc,t3_di07j0,1571114092.0,"I had this fear when I had OCD. Someone just glanced at me and I thought, ""He knows all the horrible thoughts that are popping in my head."""
ADHD,f3ss0i9,t3_cykimp,1571108070.0,"This has happened to me 2 times in the last month. We have a community laundry room at my apartment and I came in the room to find that someone had moved my damp clothes out of the dryer. Talk about embarrassment .,."
blursedimages,f3dvj0p,t3_dgo77q,1570848292.0,I'd say this is a straight cursed boba. No blessing here.
Codependency,f3de52g,t3_dfol5o,1570835399.0,"This entire subreddit and posts like these make me realize how codependent I am. I've had sex so early in relationships because I feel like if I don't that will not make my boyfriend happy. But the more I read stories like these, the more I realize that I'm allowed to have boundaries. And whether the other person likes those boundaries or not isn't my burden to bear."
Anxiety,f3da96w,t3_dgjc0e,1570833845.0,"I'm sorry to hear about your breakdown, and yea, I've have my share of those sort of moments. The person who laughed definitely has issues. It's weird that someone would have the reaction to laugh at another person who's obviously in distress. Humans are wired to be sympathetic when another person cries, or at least not find it amusing. It's good though that your boyfriend did the best he could to help, and from what you said didn't do or say anything to spite you for having a breakdown. He may not understand completely but he's doing his best.

Anyways, I'd say next time if you don't want to do something then explain to your boyfriend the reason. There's no need for excuses when it comes to your mental health. It can be hard to be honest but being open can at least help your boyfriend better understand how you feel."
Anxiety,f3d7c2i,t3_dgm6ab,1570832800.0,I'm so happy for you. Having relief from such a debilitating illness is an incredible feeling. You deserve all of the relief you can get!
Anxiety,f3d6wl6,t1_f3c3t9o,1570832654.0,"I'm sorry that you're also experiencing the same sort of frustration with this. Glad I'm not alone though. When I asked when we were told about this cancellation, the manager was like ""multiple times in group chat."" At first I felt dumb but then realized when I looked back at the conversation it was so easy to miss! It was mentioned in passing more so than as a ""important announcement:"" type thing. Grr. I want to ask if she can tell me directly next time if something changes, but I know I'm too anxious to do that sort of thing."
Anxiety,f376e09,t3_dfxpxi,1570721979.0,"Yep. Sometimes I'll only get muscle aches, flashes of hot and cold, sweat, and have tingly sensations, along with the classic wave of anxiety."
introvert,f324uhz,t3_df9ayn,1570593604.0,Yea that's typical with introversion. I'm the same way.
introvert,f324mu4,t1_f3243se,1570593402.0,Hmm I guess it does depend on the type of group.
introvert,f324b64,t3_dczoim,1570593098.0,I'm feeling the same way. I've never felt genuinely lonely until recently. Up until then the only thing I worried about was the social pressure of having a group of friends. But now it's more than that.
introvert,f3241ye,t3_df4mjd,1570592856.0,That sounds like too much socializing.
Anxiety,f323keh,t3_dfb71e,1570592417.0,That sentence is giving me anxiety too because I really don't know what she means.
