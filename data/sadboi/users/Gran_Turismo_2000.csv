There's nothing you can do besides taking your medication, if one happens it happens. Nothing you can do to control it besides taking your meds. Again it's not your fault and don't listen to him.

Epilepsy,fmjdioa,t3_fvgljm,1586128128.0,My epilepsy started out slowly it started with a seizure a year. Then this past year I had multiple seizures a week thankfully they put me on a medication to stop them and so far it's working. I would speak to your neurologist about a new medication or adding something on to prevent any further seizures.
Epilepsy,fmgovmq,t1_fmgl5zf,1586053997.0,My doc told me the same. I take b6.
Epilepsy,fmfnu5b,t3_fuyif3,1586031167.0,Same I'm on keppra. Maybe talk to your primary physician about it.
Epilepsy,fmfne8p,t3_fuyrwj,1586030907.0,My epilepsy is stress triggered according to my doctor. So yes stress can cause seizures.
Epilepsy,flgueeq,t1_flf9eka,1585150502.0,I get partial seizures that last up to 25 minutes. That was my longest one 4 weeks ago.
elderscrollsonline,fjtaqsf,t1_fjr68hx,1583605931.0,I'm a noob what does this stuff do?
ipad,fjbroqd,t3_f9vxs9,1583199942.0,Will the iPad air 2 get ipadOS 14?
elderscrollsonline,fiuwrj4,t1_fiumb0b,1582749680.0,It took me weeks to get to level 45.
elderscrollsonline,fikzbhc,t1_fikwnaj,1582490291.0,I tried that and it didn't work
elderscrollsonline,fikv8nv,t1_fikumku,1582487936.0,Nothing else was downloading at the time of the purchase
ipad,fi0lppw,t1_fi0d8sj,1582039820.0,Same.
ipad,fhywh75,t1_fhyw9qe,1581985349.0,Nope. Guess I'll be stuck on ipadOS 13.3.1
ipad,fhyw6ye,t3_f5cc0g,1581985163.0,I should have bought that instead of the iPad air 2 since I heard they might drop support for it. And I just bought it.
pcmasterrace,fgije3h,t1_fgijbc4,1580823390.0,Lol I know I'm cheap. I'm an engineering student so I plan on building a custom stand with RGB strips. A cardboard box is only temporary. I knew someone would notice that lol.
ipad,fezbuar,t1_fezbjvs,1579455751.0,I JUST noticed that. They removed them.
apple,fdioa4s,t3_elcq1r,1578447347.0,I just bought a iPad Air 2. I updated from iOS 8 to iPadOS 3.3. I only get 6-7 hours of battery life. Today I only got 3-4. Will this go away? Will my battery life stable itself? Or is it a bug or something? I need this iPad for school and I want to get the most battery life out of it. Is there anything I can do? My father thinks it was the update and in a week it should stable itself out. Thanks.
ipad,fd3r532,t1_fd3qa7b,1578161006.0,I only charged once could be perhaps that. I know on my android phone the battery would not last long on the first charge.
ipad,fd3qnnc,t1_fd3qa7b,1578160870.0,No. At least I don’t think so I do have auto updates for apps enabled
ipad,fd3o7vb,t3_dfgiuv,1578160209.0,Having the same issue on my new iPad. Using it doesn’t make the battery go down but I let it sit to take a nap and when I woke up it was down 10%
NoFap,fcfmybz,t1_fcfl24x,1577631843.0,Thanks for the advice. I know not all is lost but it just feels like that after it happen.
NoFap,fcdyajl,t1_fcdy3do,1577615071.0,I'll try not do or better yet not
NoFap,fcdy41e,t1_fcdwyfi,1577615011.0,I'm worried about falling.back into it
Vaping,fburgbz,t1_fbupw6w,1577119177.0,Yeah I think it comes down to heat killing the battery sooner. The guy at my vape store suggested I go to 1.4 coils even though I use 3% juice
Vaping,fbunc0j,t1_fbun7ya,1577117282.0,Your probably right. The 6 gets hot fast which uses more energy.
Vaping,fbumvsp,t1_fbukx3j,1577117070.0,"I've been having horrible battery life on it. I use
.6 coils. And I only get 3-4 hours of battery life."
mentalhealth,fbeq98h,t3_ecvlxa,1576791425.0,Wow delating comments that you don't agree with very original.
mentalhealth,fbemr2d,t3_ecvlxa,1576789156.0,"The thing is who is gonna pay for it? His plan puts us trillions in debt. It's a good idea on paper but it's the taxpayers who will be paying for it. Higher taxes, more poverty. The guy is very knowledgeable on economics."
lgg7,fb96r7i,t1_fb7wvt3,1576630797.0,Wouldn't they know if I would be running a custom kernel on it?
mentalhealth,fb678hy,t3_ebnzym,1576543124.0,I'm in the same situation as you with school. I feel the class the second time and my college is mad. Sometimes taking a break is a good thing. Does your school offer any services for mental health? Like counselors or anything? Have you talked to anyone else about this? I recommend reaching out to the school to show that you still are engaged in passing a classes maybe they will help you. At least that's what I'm trying to do right now to show them despite my depression I still want to pass and they are somewhat working with me. I'm a content creator to and I understand the need to take a break. And as for the cutting I also do that I haven't in 2 months but I would recommend exercising if that's possible. I know it seems tough but there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Don't give up it will get better.
mentalhealth,fb66zny,t3_ebjzzc,1576542945.0,This group is a great place to make friends with. I find a lot of people here have good knowledge on how to handle anxiety depression and so on. You can always message me too
mentalhealth,fa0zua9,t3_e7f9d7,1575762508.0,I use to. Like I'm just getting over it thanks to new meds. What I normally do when they get like that just go for a walk or bike ride. Physical activity can help. Or watch a movie or play a video game. Those are the things that help me cope.
Vaping,f97wopn,t1_f97ve6p,1575171204.0,Found out it's not. But thanks for the advice
mentalhealth,f96njdi,t3_e3yuwb,1575148388.0,We are all here for each other. My DMs are open. If you need someone to call send me a message and I'll give you my cell number. I know how it feels. It gets better and I know everyone says that but it's true. It just takes time. Took me years.
mentalhealth,f96neum,t3_e3ttyo,1575148297.0,Call 911
Vaping,f96ndu2,t3_e3rphs,1575148277.0,I'm so sorry for your loss. If you need anything message me.
mentalhealth,f8r2ae5,t1_f8r1ayj,1574730179.0,I'm glad you are recovering. And thank you for your input. I only have depression though. If it works I don't want to go over 1mg. Reviews look promising. I had a bad reaction to ablify and I saw its a similar drug.
lgg7,f82mamo,t3_dypqlm,1574193980.0,Nevermind fixed it

Android,f6xo7sc,t1_f6wrmd2,1573253997.0,They really needed to add that third camera and a bigger battery. I think it would have been the perfect device but they are following Apple now. I hate to say this but apple is listening to their customers and giving them bigger batteries and better cameras. Don't get me wrong I'm not trashing Android or the pixel 4. The pixel 4 still gets better stills but the iPhone 11 Pro follows close behind. They need to get with the program with the next generation of pixel phones.
NoFap,f6xjzu1,t1_f6xf5u9,1573251127.0,I was just reading about that. It says it's the body's natural reaction getting rid of its waste. And to avoid future wet dreams to lie on your back sleeping.
NoFap,f6xellt,t1_f6xa99z,1573248014.0,I know. I just feel bleh now. Just makes me feel down and out.
lgg7,f25ajeb,t1_f259fjv,1569969799.0,Omg it worked. Thank you so much!
lgg7,f25ae6p,t1_f259fjv,1569969703.0,I'll try that.
lgg7,f22i0kg,t1_f22h829,1569889449.0,It happens on all launchers I tried Nova Apex Microsoft it just won't work with the nav pill
electronic_cigarette,f1f6n2h,t3_d944rq,1569437934.0,This is what I like about this vaping community. This is something we all share if we're a left or right. I love how we fight as one now. Both parties want to take our safe alternatives away and it must stop.
electronic_cigarette,f0gbtg1,t1_f0g0bjy,1568596956.0,I'm broke af currently. Hopefully I'll get some money here soon. My local vape shop is having a huge sale. So it will be the perfect opportunity to stock up.
electronic_cigarette,f0f41kq,t1_f0f3k6q,1568577659.0,In New York you can't buy pocket knives online. They're doing the same to vape juice apparently.
NoFap,f05lv5k,t3_d3oyru,1568413133.0,I'm one week away from my 3 months anniversary of stopping. What you say is true though. However there still days I feel the urge to.
Android,eyf70hb,t3_cws8w8,1567044363.0,Okay my had won't happen again
iBUYPOWER,esig85r,t1_esig4gz,1562013126.0,Yes it's a 3.5 mm Jack and it's from a smartphone. I'll try the rear port.
Vaping,es6yc39,t3_bbsr6h,1561659984.0,"I should go with .8 then. For some reason on mine the .6 gurgles a lot
 It doesn't with other coils."
electronic_cigarette,es1rjkq,t1_es1mqv5,1561503912.0,Thanks I never paid attention to the PG/VG.  I'll give it a shot
electronic_cigarette,ervcazt,t3_c3wiqt,1561312051.0,Congratulations! I hope to follow in your footsteps.
electronic_cigarette,eri01za,t3_c20dvf,1560886593.0,Hope your okay! May I ask what type of batteries you were using? A lot of fake batteries are out there and are at high risk of blowing up. Anyways hope your okay. I would put ice and cortisone cream on your hand.
CitiesSkylines,eohfi3i,t1_eog58ak,1558580227.0,No
