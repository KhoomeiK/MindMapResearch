All i do is sitting in my room wishing i had a dick lol.

I constantly have those nagging 'i can never be a real guy' thoughts and felt like crap about it, until i kinda realized that my only problem with that is that I'm afraid about other peoples opinions. 

And honestly i couldn't care less about if someone is trans or cis, when i like someone i don't care about gender. 

So i just gotta find myself someone who thinks like me and will love me bc I'm me, and not bc i have a dick or not.

That kinda helped me a bit and now i don't feel as pressured. Maybe it helps u or anyone else too. 

Keep on powering trough and it will all work out dude! ^-^"

I personally felt like i was a guy since i was 8 or maybe even younger, and still to this day I'm pretty sure that if i go trough transition i will probably still want to feel cute, maybe even crossdress. But not because i want to be a girl or I'm not a real guy. I just think crossdressing looks really good if you do it right."

SuicideWatch,fmkxpgj,t1_fmkwhcz,1586172559.0,"I'm suicidal myself, so you don't need to explain that to me. But deep down we all know that people will miss us. We're usually just in denial bc dying would be way easier, it would be better for everyone, right?
We just try to talk ourself into that so that we don't have to feel bad when we commit suicide.

And that's the thing, nobody expects you to endure severe pain, they want you to feel better, they want you to try to change, to help you as good as they can. 
Just like you just want to feel better and hope / expect that its better for everyone when your gone.

The thing just is, both is selfish.
Its selfish to only care about your pain and not the pain of anybody else. That's what they do when they don't want you to die, and its what you do if you plan on committing suicide too."
SuicideWatch,fmkupv5,t1_fmkty7p,1586169402.0,"I get what you mean.
But its not about being selfish that you want to leave.
The selfish part is that you don't think about anyone or anything else. You can hurt people really badly if you kill yourself, and if you just do that without even trying anything to get better than i think it is a pretty selfish thing to do. 
Suicide is horrible in general, but just because you feel like shit you shouldn't try to justify taking yourself away from everyone that knew you without a single warning. And leave them wondering what they all did wrong. The thought behind the whole thing counts more than the suicide itself in the end i think."
SuicideWatch,fmktzyl,t1_fmksf1z,1586168605.0,"Many psychologists / therapists also had or have psychological problems. And psychologists / therapists aren't magicians that can figure out what's wrong with you or what might help you. You have to work with them togheter to figure it all out.

SuicideWatch,fmktt7x,t1_fmkoqqj,1586168396.0,"Yeah, but here you are acting like depression and feeling suicidal is something that can't get better.
There are a lot of things you can try to fell better and your family and friends would probably do everything to help you trough it.

Its pretty much the same scenario as if you had cancer and the doctors knew you had a 99% chance to get better trough chemotherapy, and then you would just tell them that you rather die than try it."
SuicideWatch,fmktf9g,t1_fmkbril,1586167962.0,"Even if suicide is a medical issue. Just because your sick it doesn't mean that you can't be selfish. Suicide is still a decision that you make. And when you decide to kill yourself then it is just as selfish as not wanting someone to die. Because in the end you don't care about anyone that will miss you or loves you. You just want to die because its easier than being alive.

And that you might ruin your family or friends with that isn't something your thinking about at all when you really just end up killing yourself. I attempted too. I thought this for a long time too. But we just tell ourselves that its not selfish so that we can feel better about doing it."

I read trough some of your comments and posts and you seem to be a wonderful person, you tried to help others even tho you didn't feel good yourself. Thank you so much for doing that, we need to support eachother, that's the only way how things can get slightly better, and how some of us feel less alone.

SuicideWatch,fkjpplk,t3_fir9m2,1584254253.0,"The thing just is, suicidal people are just as selfish as every other person. Other people are selfish bc they want u to stay even tho u suffer. Ur selfish bc u rather die than hold on longer to maybe just be there for people that care about you.

The thing is it's your decision and i don't want to tell you anything. But you (and every suicidal person) and every human is almost always selfish. We do usually everything bc its easier for us or makes us feel good. We're all selfish bc we are humans.

Still, taking your own life is always something to reconsider, i get that its hard if there's nothing important enough for you to keep going, but still you could reconsider it for yourself too. If its not a very quick process you will probably regret it and i doubt that that's fun at all.

And i know life probably sucks just as much as regretting suicide if not a bit more. But still, maybe there's anything at all that can be worth just another second or minute. Anything really. Life sucks so much i know, but it also has some good sides sometimes, the tiniest things. 

I don't wanna say it gets better, because that's not true. Things don't just get better, but you might find things that are better than what you have now, and those things can be worth it.

Reconsider, maybe one day you'll just look at the stars or at a person or just anything, and there's your reason to keep on trying."

So i tried. And I'm currently working out and doing other things that make me happy instead of miserable.

I started a journal to write down small goals and life goals to organize my thoughts and get things done. This of course probably wont work for everyone, but regardless it all helped me.

And I'm positive that anyone is able to find something in his life that makes it slightly better.

For me it actually was a dog. He's all i have. And i realized that i need to be stronger and better for him if i can't be any of that for myself. And now I'm working on changing myself and my habits for the better.

I'm not looking at the future thinking its gonna be bright by now. Not every day and every task is easy. But I'm doing my best. And I can only get better if i keep on trying. So that's what i do.

And i believe that everyone can find something that lessens their pain to a point where its worth to keep on trying.

It will get better, if you find anything in this world that helps you to feel again. But that also doesn't mean that it won't come back. 

I just hope that i find another reason before my dog will leave me. It hasn't been easy to keep going at all, even tho i have him. He's still everything and i am nothing to myself. 

But that's kinda how life works. You build up things that make you want to stay and you either change, accept and love yourself for the better until you can live with those burdens or you die.

Honestly sex is a pretty important topic in most relationships but sex is also about much more than penis size, if you are able to pleasure a girl in any way that's good. Doesn't matter if you use your dick for that or not.
I really think you have good chances of finding a great girl if you just keep on trying. Because there are girls that don't necessarily need a guy with a big dick.
For example, i am a Bisexual girl and i don't care about size at all. I'm also used to sleeping with women and therefore don't really give a fuck. Sex can also be awesome if its oral or any other practice that doesn't involve a penis.

I'm not an addict or heroin enthusiast myself! But i know quite alot about depression, selfharm and suicide..

I'm only on this sub because i had to do some research about heroin and i stayed out of interest..

But anyways. I know how bad life can be even tho i may not have any connection with heroin etc. And i can imagine that you may go trough a lot but please reconsider this.

I know that you probably just don't know what to do anymore and that you just want a little bit of peace for yourself.

There are people who love you and i dont Know if your aware of how much it will fuck up their lives if you leave them like this. I know that its not fair, i know that you just want to feel better. But suicide isn't a good solution. Theres a good chance that you will regret it just seconds after attempting.

And i really dont want to tell you what to do but please reconsider your choice. Even tho everything sucks right now there is a chance for you to change it. You are a valuable human being and dont deserve to miss out on everything thats ahead of you.

Sneks,eovxoxg,t1_eovx1xd,1558902225.0,"Thank you! Thats really good to know!

Did you ever breed bush vipers? They give live birth right?
Is it also dangerous if newborn bush vipers bite you? I know that the fangs of non venomous snake babies are fairly unnoticeable when you get bitten."
Sneks,eovu1j5,t1_eovtcac,1558900679.0,"Well my biggest question is how to clean and feed them whitout risking to get bitten. And also can you keep them togheter in one enclosure?

I heard that they usually dont mind each other.
And are bush vipers really as calm as everyone says?"
Sneks,eovs9v4,t1_eovpyuk,1558899934.0,"I know, especially because theres not really an anti serum for their venom. But either way being bitten by a venomous snake isn't fun.

Would you mind if i asked you some things about keeping them as pets tho? 
I don't have snakes yet but I'd like to keep some ball pythons etc. And maybe consinder to buy some venomous snakes in the far future!

It's just that i cant really find any info about bush vipers as pets and I'm curious! :)"

Sneks,eouyizz,t1_eouyd2v,1558884297.0,"It's a bush viper!
