clevelandcavs,fgddbun,t3_exulnb,1580681323.0,"Personally I dont hate Sexton. I’ve started arguments on here because I haven’t communicated like I am now about him. 

I think my expectations were just really high for him with watching him at Alabama.  I just really expected him to develop into this monster efficient guard who can score, pass, and play defense.  Which.....TBH he’s actually playing really well of recent with his scoring, defense, and assists ( which is what I’ve been harping on).  I don’t hate him at all it’s just alone he’s not enough for the cavs to win and this sub reddit cherishes his strengths and playing hard that still don’t equate for wins.  
I will admit I’ve been hard on him but to see his true potential some things need to change on this roster for him to fully develop. After we potentially trade love, tristian, and play Kevin porter more along with the growth of Darius only then will we see what he can do THEN I’ll judge him. I just think cavs fans are impatient with the losing and looking to blame someone and he’s been the scape goat.  Nobody wants to blame love lol. Hopefully this makes sense and I don’t sound stupid lol."
