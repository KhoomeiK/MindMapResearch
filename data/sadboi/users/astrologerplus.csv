It just seems so angry and out of place for a book like AK. That being said I usually attribute it to Anna and her suicide. I'd definitely like to hear what every one else thinks.

It was just such an astute observation that someone who kills themselves in a situation like Anna's probably doesn't want to die really. Anyway, reading through the book, I did not really see this coming so it was all the more of a surprise."

Sekiro,fhzm7tw,t3_f5k606,1582003555.0,"I imagine the developers would of tried having a fighting stance. If they had it similar to the block stance, it would be confusing for players as it makes it hard to tell if you're blocking or not. 

If it wasn't so similar, it might cause a delay to go from the fighting stance to running or jumping etc. Probably just too difficult to do without effecting the other mechanics in the game. 

If you take a game like Witcher 3, when you enter combat, you are locked in so to speak and something like that would be a hindrance in Sekiro."
Sekiro,fhzlyz8,t3_f5coft,1582003334.0,"In terms of combat, for sure. I like how they make the bosses have a well rounded move set so you can't cheese them that easily. The base mechanics are well thought out too. 

There are normal attacks, thrusts, sweeps and grabs. All which have difference counters/punishments.

Having poison, fire, terror and lightning also have meaningful differences.

It's just really nicely thought out, it makes the bosses more gratifying to beat rather than cheese which can't be said for a lot of game bosses."

Sekiro,fhrgcgy,t1_fhrfbch,1581825512.0,"You can deflect those super cheap hits where he steps in quickly and has a swipe at you and steps back immediately. Those pissed me off so much lol. Also that uppercut swipe where he drags his hand on the ground.

Other than that, just run around and wait for openings like post poo throw and after he tries to jump on you. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8-S5R8Zx8s I'd recommend this video since it isn't about cheesing or finding some exploit."
Sekiro,fhrfn8p,t1_fhoxvsa,1581824999.0,I died heaps to him. I wasn't sure if I'd beat him. A feeling I'd get many times through out the game. Took me like 100 hours for the first play through.

Sekiro,fhrdxyl,t1_fhn44v7,1581823830.0,"I'm on NG++ right now and I'm doing a Charmless/Demon Bell run. It's good because I've got all the skills and items I want already so I'm not worried about losing xp/sen really. Now it's about playing the game 'properly'. 

I finished Genichiro like that yesterday funnily enough, it's harder but not by much. And if you want to do a damageless run, charmless/demon bell is definitely a good way to train since it will reveal any deflect timing errors you might have with the chip damage.

Headless is the most fun without Confetti, just pure deflect yo!"

Their rhythm is just so much more varied and slow than bosses like Owl and Lady Butterfly. The Headless with that really slow hit he follows up with after the quick overhead strikes gets me all the time.

Being aggressive as possible is good I think, it's another layer to the fight to improve at."
Sekiro,fhk6lkt,t3_f3p8st,1581669246.0,"Well after a thousand tries and all the youtube videos and tips, I doubt I could give you any advice you haven't heard/tried. All I can say is, work on improving at the boss fight rather than trying to finish him if that makes sense. Instead of running in a circle, run towards him so you can learn all his moves and how to deflect them and punish him."
Sekiro,fhk5wjt,t3_f3bn3e,1581668280.0,"Haha yeah he cracked me up. I honestly thought he would be a sword only character due to his name. Then he gets out a spear and a pistol. Made me laugh.

Sekiro,fheocgf,t1_fhe05cx,1581526570.0,He has a punch which does little damage or he can stab you with his flute which packs more of a punch.
