ibs,fowdjk0,t3_g9ygli,1588117695.0,"I went to a gastro about a year ago and she had me take Metamucil , and IBgard before I eat. 

I’ve given up taken the Metamucil because I feel like it has done nothing for me. 

The IBgard is amazing. Before I started taking it, when I would  I eat ,I would immediate have to use the bathroom and my stomach would cramp so much that I would cry. Using the IBgard has helped that by about 85%. I still have a lot if issues where I either have to use the bathroom the entire day, or I go without pooping for over a week. 

Try to find a dietitian as well ! That’s my next step.

Edit: Also 27F."
Anxiety,fosu1tm,t1_foqvn4d,1588038047.0,"This! I’ve been doing this social distancing and remaining at home since March 21st. I go to the grocery store when I have to and I’m in and out as quick as possible. Recently I’ve been having more and more anxiety just thinking about going to the store and it freaks me out. My friend called me today to tell me she doesn’t care anyone. That if she wants to go see her friends, she will. If she wants to go to the beach, she will.  I told her to get the antibody testing since she believes she already had the virus and say “no because if I don’t have the antibodies then I’m going to be worried to catch it”. 

Needless to say,  I won’t be seeing anyone for a while."

I also have like no enamel on my teeth (genetics) so they’re just decaying and there’s nothing I can do to stop it. Right now I have two black spots on my front two teeth so I try to not even smile. I have to save up about $1000 to get them fixed.

Easiest way to do it is pay your bills weekly. 

My car payment is $407 . Every week I take $100 out of the bank and put it in an envelope.
Car insurance is $142. Every week I take out $35 and put it in an envelope. Etc etc

With doing that you’re never too strapped and you know the bills that you have to pay are paid."
