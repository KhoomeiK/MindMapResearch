TooAfraidToAsk,f5bay3e,t3_dneoae,1572119425.0,Yes. Pets become an extension of our family.  Nobody can tell you it’s abnormal to grieve something we love and everyone grieves for different lengths of time in different ways.

NoStupidQuestions,f55vd3q,t3_dmmjmn,1572014292.0,"I just be honest and say I have 5 siblings. When I’m asked what they do for a living, when I get to my little sister I simply say she’s dead then move onto my younger brother. Most people don’t ask questions, I think it’s awkward for them, but they all say “sorry about your sister”.  I guess each person handles the question differently."

religion,ervaiko,t3_c45sj7,1561310722.0,"I don’t know you well enough to know whether you may go to hell. Each person, each religion has its own idea of hell. Belonging to a particular faith doesn’t mean you have a leg up so to speak in my opinion. There are some very religious people who have done some awful things, and there are some atheists out there who have done some wonderful things. I don’t believe there is hell fire and brimstone. With all the suffering and destruction maybe this life is our hell. I believe that no matter what religion you are, if any, your faith will not save you, your good deeds will."
