walmart,feft3zf,t3_eojnoh,1579064386.0,You know what they say PEOPLE SUCK! I'm not above the statement we all have our days.
walmart,fefsqfn,t3_eosats,1579064067.0,Yeah I'll just go do my taxes for free with TurboTax.
walmart,fe2e6lz,t3_enap13,1578837360.0,As a cart pusher I understand all to well.  People are in a rush and I almost get hit daily.  You think Walmart would give us peons some hazard pay.  What makes me chuckle is how people speed up when I am pushing a load of carts across the main road into the bay.  I think people forget that a parking lot gives pedestrians the right away at all times and the speed limit is pretty low.  Yet we get people cruising in at 30 mph and than flip me off when they have to stop.  Retail work makes me hate human beings.

walmart,fe2cy3i,t3_enjf1c,1578837000.0,"Fellow cart-pusher here.  Sounds like your CSM is a busy body who wants to flex her little baby sitter power.  Fight the coaching with an open door even though personally I have no faith in that system it's worth a shot! Or speak to a manager that actually respects you. I  have a front end manager who backs me up all the time so I'm pretty lucky.   

Also I feel your pain though we are definitely the most underappreciated staff at Walmart.  I push over the limit all the time but they leave me alone because frankly the job would not get done doing 5 or ten at a time with thousands of people coming in.  Stay strong man and also beautiful picture :)"
walmart,fdqw9gr,t3_emmm0q,1578675715.0,"Frankly if somebody has their firearm on there side I could careless.  We had a guy come in with his daughter and he had a sidearm and all I heard was a manager freaking out on the radio like guns are illegal(thank God they are not) If someone has evil intentions there coming in hot and shooting,  not pushing a cart full of groceries with their family.  A gun free zone is open range for psychos."
walmart,fdqthvk,t3_empndg,1578674538.0,Welcome to Wal-Mart!
walmart,fdizxmx,t3_eli22r,1578454941.0,That's too funny!
walmart,fdizhpj,t3_elhxrt,1578454639.0,"I haven't seen our store this bad but the generally consensus is Walmart stores are understaffed and employees are overworked!  The company just doesn't give a fuck and they probably never will until they hit rock bottom. All they care about is their profits and sales.   I like to work hard and have something to show but there comes a point when it's not worth it and Walmart is one of those jobs.   This is what I tell my management ""I care about Walmart as much as they care about me""  Good luck on your store and don't stress yourself to death over it! If worse comes to worse look for a different job. I see a lot of old coworkers come in and they all say the same thing ""I'm so happy I left Walmart"""

SuicideWatch,fad5hxv,t3_e8jy6c,1575956148.0,"A lot of people feel the way you do sadly.  I know how it is when you see families or couples and an empty feeling hits you as if you're missing something worthwhile in life.  Especially hits hard when you get home from work to find no one there because you live alone.  I think you're suffering from an extremely negative perspective or simply put depression because  I also grew up in a dysfunctional family which has affected my adult life in negative ways.  I find myself thinking, I'm not needed or wanted, girls don't like me etc.  In reality it's not true but my mind state is stuck in the ""darkness.""  That's what I call it because you see no light and your blind to joy or opportunities for happiness. 

About men not being attracted to you... Well they might be and you might not know it. To be fair you can't read minds and there might be somebody who is interested.  I bet there is a man who looks at you interested but you probably don't know it.  

I hope you find a man who loves you but it may not be the man you think you want.  An anecdote if you will, I had a friend and at first I wasn't attracted to her at all but we hanged out a lot. I knew her for a few years and we clicked. She was interested in me and I had this thought one day to give her a chance and to be honest she was the best woman I ever had who genuinely loved me.  I ended up experiencing the most wonderful love making and her beauty radiated in a way I never could have imagined.  I later on screwed that relationship up(that's a story for another time) and I still kick my butt over it but the moral of the story is give someone a chance who actually wants you even if the person isn't perfect looking,  You might get a pleasant surprise.  

   Anyways sorry about the long msg but I understand your pain.  I hope things get better for you sweetie be safe."
SuicideWatch,facq5vl,t3_e8gjky,1575944525.0,This is an absolutely horrible thing to hear happen to you!  You need to go to the police right now because what happened to you is very serious!   Those fuckers deserve to rot in prison for a lifetime so please go to the police station and tell them!  Other than that brother I don't know what to tell you.  I don't think words can heal what happened but you deserve justice please talk to the police.  I made a reddit account after reading your post just right now.  Remember you didn't do anything wrong! You were taken advantage of in a very evil an violent way so please don't hate yourself for that.  Kinda strange that your GF isn't more supportive considering what happened to you and the fact that she didn't get touched at all is fishy.  That's just my thoughts on it anyways if you got family who loves you go to them and make a police report!   No wonder I sleep with a pistol in today's crazy world.  Be safe brother
