You know how much it hurts to lose your parents, so making her go through the same pain is just cruel.

I get that you're just holding her to her own standards, but I don't see how making another person suffer greatly will not make you TA as well.

If you would have let her take time off, maybe she would have reflected her own past actions, but you denied her of that, and just made her pissed at you."

depression,ews088m,t3_cpvwhh,1565717525.0,"I can strongly relate.

Feeling like that is hard, you're functioning and trying to show everyone that everything's great, but deep down you feel awful 

Don't let anyone underestimate the pain you're going through, each mental illness has it's own struggles.

Keep fighting, I hope you get to feel better soon."
