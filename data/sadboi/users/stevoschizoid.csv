It's not as bad as you think it is being on medicines

Aside of being a recluse due to my triggers and the side effects, I live a pretty normal life with schizophrenia. 

I've had it since 2007 and I didn't get help until 2016

Wish I did, I went through so crazy shit.

Good luck I really hope you can go talk to a local mental health clinic don't be scared as long as you don't have a plan you won't be locked away. We're here for you"
