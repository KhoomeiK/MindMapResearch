Perhaps it’s just cause we’re in quarantine so my thought system is just different and that might induce more paranoia? Dunno. Either way wish I had a better tolerance when on my own."

UFC3,fgsh9at,t3_f05a80,1581084277.0,Leg kicks aren’t cheap not just because they’re a legitimate technique but also I wouldn’t consider them to be cheesy In game. You’re not abusing a move set that’s cheesy and unrealistic so have at it.
MMA,fewmii6,t3_eqsdq4,1579414704.0,"Cerrone ducked a straight left and entered the clinch, everyone was saying this should be his goal to grapple, he enters the clinch and has his nose smashed from conors shoulder (later confusing it for his elbow). 

Then Conor landed a rear head kick and that was the end of the fight. People claiming it was a fix are people who wanted Conor to lose."

Could be shit."

He simply said ‘that now that Frank is at city he is trying to win, he’s a professional, he’s not there for holiday he’s there to beat you. Your club’.  (Paraphrasing a bit) 

Personally i think that I kind of agree with the sentiment, he was still giving frank praise he didn’t seem to be shitting on him. It seemed complementary as mourinho is truly invested in winning."

FIFA,f275y47,t1_f26mjig,1570031322.0,"Honestly I do both I spend a little bit of money but spending hundreds or thousands of pounds I refuse to do. I think £15 here and there isn’t that bad. I know people will say that’s what EA want you to think, which is true but I care more about my personal experience than the company making loads of money. 

I enjoy playing draft with the £15 I spend and end up doubling the value of packs and improving my team. I earn most coins through playing however after I’ve got a solid team. If someone wants to spend hundreds that’s alright, it’s their money but I don’t want to feel handicapped for it. But then if you have a better team you should have an advantage so it’s a lot more complex. 

Main thing that baffles me is spending hundreds in the first week of the game before you even can determine if you enjoy the game."
FIFA,f26tdpu,t1_f26t7qb,1570022851.0,"Of course, but there are some games where I felt I’m better or at least same skill level and then lose. I’m Division 4 rank 1420, and I normally have the worse team going into game. I guess I can look forward to the fact of when I get a better team I’ll be in a higher division and win more but it’s still annoying playing with 82 overall players. 

I really enjoy the game though"

NBA2k,f0ezrn5,t1_f0eyva5,1568575911.0,"In what aspects? Personally I really don’t enjoy the new movement system I think it is really janky, I don’t think it’s realistic either as I get stuck in an animation going left and by the time my guy turns back or right it’s too late and that doesn’t happen in real life as you can control what you want to do. I think shooting isn’t as fun, I understand 19 was way too easy but 2k20 isn’t nerfed in a good way. Yes it’s nerfed which was needed but it’s not nerfed for the better imo, as now I just don’t enjoy shooting at all. People can hit moving 3’s green.  I wanted it to be nerfed but I wanted the nerf to result in an overall better experience and I’m not sure it has."

NBA2k,ezqc42s,t3_d1ic0u,1568057350.0,I think the hop jumper/ gather needs to be nerfed a bit I think you should be able to do good with it but I think you need to be punished more if you do it in a bad decision. I really hope it gets changed this year and isn’t just a staple exploit of the game. I know it happens every year but I think it’s can be tweaked a bit and still be good.
NBA2k,ezq8cg4,t1_ezq87o0,1568056032.0,Apparently they’re reverting it back and it was only changed on my park

NBA2k,ezpybjw,t3_d1lt6h,1568051303.0, How do I change badges? It only lets me switch it up when I have an available upgrade but what about when I get all 30 and can’t earn another with I be stuck with those 30?

NBA2k,ezg9zjj,t3_d0ygw8,1567893876.0,"People are complaining about shooting but don’t have badges and probably aren’t using a ‘meta’ release, so I’d like it to at least be left to sink in, changes to gameplay that aren’t purely bug fixes are unnecessary at the moment. 

I bet most people haven’t tried the off ball mechanics I’m not sure if they’re good or not but I assume it’ll change the way the game is played off ball. 

Also it seems like it is a bit harder to green but it was way too easy last year and I’m still hitting a few greens without any gold or Hof badges. 

I think people need to let the game settle."

NBA2k,ezezyss,t3_d0mvrq,1567871057.0,"I think the shooting is alright the catch and shoot seems easier to green, although I haven’t played online. Of course it’s harder than last year but last year was one of the easiest games for greening I’ve played so it’s going to be harder this year id assume. Once everyone has hall of games I think if you’re open it should be alright."
FIFA,ey2keir,t1_ey2jwub,1566741816.0,"Yeah I just think they can become abusive, personally skills are fine to an extent I think they have just become too big of a part on the overall game. I think the game rewards people who can do skills more so than people who like to bring the ball up and pass about but that’s always been FUT I just feel this year it’s worse. For example you can flick the ball up into a volley and with 95 overalls it can just fly into the top corner which to me is less skill and more the overall of the player. But I know what you mean I just personally think it could be balanced better."

This ‘1 year rental’ has the Toronto Raptors on the verge of their first ever NBA Championship. This one year already is their most successful season ever.
