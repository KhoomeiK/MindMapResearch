I was pushing myself to process everything intellectually, thinking this would be enough, such that I never let the lessons I was learning sit long enough to register on a deeper level. And so as this continued I kept going from one psychiatric crisis to the next with only short breaks in between.

TalkTherapy,fqm6v4x,t3_gjgtr1,1589472508.0,"The last few therapists I've had have been very open about my diagnoses. Personally I find it helpful to know my current diagnosis, because it helps me to have a context for my experiences and to know that there's a relatively clear line of treatment instead of feeling like I'm wandering blind in the woods. I also understand, though, that my diagnoses are subject to change depending on how my symptoms present themselves over the course of my lifetime, and as my needs and priorities change. So I've also directly inquired about the accuracy of my diagnoses when I notice that something seems off about how my symptoms are presenting. Some people, though, don't handle knowing their diagnosis very well. They internally rebel against the label (and that's all it is, a label to summarize a set of symptoms commonly seen together), and struggle with being identified as 'mentally ill.' This is simply a matter of how people and their needs differ, not in any way a judgement of those needs.

If you want/need to know your diagnosis to better progress in your treatment you should ask your psychologist directly. They may want to have a conversation with you about why you want to know and what you hope to gain from knowing it, but they should also be open about your diagnosis and how they determined it to be most accurate. Feel free to ask any questions you have regarding it, for example how this impacts the treatment they've been providing you. Some diagnoses don't require much specialized treatment, but others really benefit from at least small changes in focus or emphasis in order to improve your functionality.

Try to avoid self diagnosis before you have this conversation, though. It may prevent you from being able to understand the diagnosis and accept/reject it with as little bias as possible. Also, be prepared to possibly surprised, perhaps unpleasantly, by this. Some diagnoses carry a lot of societal stigma that has little to do with the actual disorder.

Psychosis,fqm2o45,t1_fqlw7ts,1589470459.0,"As far as I'm aware, and I've read a lot about this, delusions are always a psychotic symptom. They're not to be confused by paranoia, which can be severe enough to be considered a delusion, but for many people don't get to that level of intensity. Delusions and hallucinations are two mutually distinct psychotic symptoms, and one does not require the other to be present, although when they're both present they often reinforce each other. Delusions are persistent beliefs or senses of reality that do not match commonly held societal beliefs and are contradictory with evidence to the contrary. Hallucinations affect our sensory perceptions, that present themselves as experiencing either visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile, or gustatory sensations that are not caused by external stimuli. One is a disorder of reasoning, and the other of sensory perception. Sometimes a hallucination can reinforce delusional beliefs, but they are still considered to be two distinct symptoms. Some people who are experiencing psychosis only experience one, or the other (or other psychotic symptoms, such as disordered speech), but all are still considered to be experiencing psychosis.

There is some overlap between severe anxiety and psychosis inasmuch as it can be difficult to distinguish between the two, as well as severe dissociation and psychosis, but anxiety is not considered to be psychosis. 

I've heard the line that neuro-psychiatry is not a hard science, usually from advocates of antipsychiatry, many of whom don't know much about neuroscience (not that I claim to be an expert, but I do study it some). From what I have been able to learn, quite a lot is known about the brain, and more is learned every day. These things are learned through scientific studies as valid as any other medical study. There aren't blood tests for mental illnesses, just as there aren't blood tests for many diseases. At this point these disorders are diagnosed by identifying the symptoms of the person and excluding all other possible causes, as is true of many physiological disorders, like Lupus, Parkinson's disease, MS, and fibromyalgia. This is considered as valid a method of diagnosis as any other by doctors, as long as a proper differential is performed. You can challenge the taxonomy used by different diagnostic methods for mental illnesses, this is a matter of constant debate among doctors (and part of the distinction between the DSM and the ICD), but until other methods of testing are available, symptom identification is considered sound."

schizophrenia,fqhokcb,t3_giwjjv,1589381233.0,"I would hesitate to characterize him as not feeling as much just because he doesn't express his feelings (unless he says that he doesn't really feel things). It's pretty common with schizophrenia to experience the full range of emotions but have a flat affect that people interpret as lack of care/emotion. There's not much we can do about that, though. 

That said, it doesn't sound like there's a very healthy dynamic in your relationship. Relationships are supposed to be two way and really only work if there is open communication. It's clear that you don't feel like your needs are being met, and from the sound of it he may not be gaining anything from it either. In general I don't recommend trying to ""train"" your partner to do anything he isn't willingly on board with. That's a recipe for disaster and resentment later. 

It sounds like you have an idea of what you want from the relationship, so it's time for you to evaluate your boundaries in the relationship. Work these out before speaking with him, it helps prevent you from getting emotionally swept up and losing focus. What are your wants and your needs (both are valid) that he should be providing? What are you and aren't you willing to give to the relationship? At what point do you walk? Once you've figured these things out, you need to sit down and talk with him about it. He may not be able to engage with that conversation when you first try to approach him, but you can communicate that it's important and it's on him to then tell you when he's ready to have that conversation. I recommend setting a hard deadline for that, rather than letting it fall off and never happen. Communicate consequences that will follow if he doesn't bring it up. If he's not willing to have that conversation at all then that tells you something important about your relationship, too. 

A good way to communicate is to not make accusations or statements of blame. Ask questions. Maybe he doesn't realize how his behavior is making you feel. Maybe he doesn't even realize he's doing it.  When you make statements format them like, ""when you do \_\_\_this\_\_\_ it makes me feel \_\_\_this\_\_\_."" Unfortunately he may lash out anyway. He may not like being confronted or having demands placed upon him. That's tough, but compromise and being willing to give and take is part of being in a relationship.

 It was over a decade of struggling to function with some very serious issues before I was willing to try to open up to a therapist and get the help I needed. I think part of my willingness to do so was timing, I realized that I needed some help and came to terms with the idea. Part of it was that I had a specific idea of what I needed to explore and get out of therapy, a topic that felt like a safe place to start. And partially, I went to see a therapist who was recommended to me by several people I trusted, so I had hope that I wouldn’t be confronted with the same problems in therapy that I’d had as a teen.

Obviously, by the name of the class of drugs, they are used to treat psychosis, which is a symptom that can be caused by a number of psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, PTSD, anxiety, BPD, etc. Sometimes they are also used to treat conditions such as treatment resistant depression, severe anxiety, OCD, tourettes syndrome, insomnia, and many other conditions without the presentation of psychotic features. So if you weren't told that you have a diagnosis of schizophrenia you should tell this to your current mental health provider. 

In answer to your questions:

1) Yes. The themes of hallucinations and delusions tend to be heavily influenced by the person's culture, and some people have generally positive or neutral hallucinations.

2) Schizophrenia is a lifelong condition. Not all psychotic disorders are, though, so it's possible that you may be dealing with only a single incident of psychosis.

3) It's possible to only have hallucinations in a psychotic episode. From what I know, and I'm NAD, this is more commonly seen in conditions like mood disorders that are presenting with psychotic features than with psychotic disorders. 

I wrote that without understanding your question. Some people only experience psychotic symptoms during a psychotic episode, yes. While others experience some degree of psychotic symptoms persistently, with them increasing in severity during an episode. 

4) This is a hard one to come to terms with. The short answer is 'you just do because (for some) life with psychosis is worse than life without it.' You'll find your own way to accept it, and eventually they'll become the new normal for you. Or they won't and you'll stop taking them (I do take meds, but I understand why many people don't or stop taking them). I do recommend looking up the side effects of your medications, though. Some of them can be really scary, but it's important to be able to recognize when you start to experience one of the more difficult or dangerous ones. For instance, you should watch for signs that indicate that you're starting to become diabetic and tell your doctor if they're happening. Some people don't really experience bad side effects, and some do. It's really a toss up. Don't let them scare you off, but you should be aware of the risks involved. 

TL;DR It may not be schizophrenia if your only symptom was hallucinations. Antipsychotics are prescribed for many reasons. Followed by responses to your questions."
schizophrenia,fpwpfy9,t3_gfxvxn,1588967570.0,"Prognoses are based on statistics, they actually don't say anything about the individual case. Each person in the exact same situation has the exact same probable outcome as any other person in that situation, and some have better outcomes than others. This is because statistics are descriptive, not prescriptive. It's scary to know that your condition may significantly deteriorate, I've been there too, but your prognosis is not you and doesn't dictate what will actually happen to you. Some people are able to improve their prognoses through the decisions they make and how much success they're able to achieve with treatment. And some people aren't able to improve (despite whatever attempts are made), but they also never experience significant deterioration. And, yes, some people experience significant deterioration. But all of this happens on the individual level, and is not dictated by statistics. You have a chance for any outcome. Try to not give up on yourself. Things may not look good but it isn't a hopeless situation. 

On a related note, I don't know that it makes sense to compare how lucky someone is based on the subtype of their diagnosis. All forms of schizophrenia are awful. Some people have more mild cases of schizophrenia, while others have significantly more severe cases and and require long term care. This is true of all forms of schizophrenia. This isn't a competition to the bottom. We need to be there for each other because it sure is hard to find others who will be there for us."
schizophrenia,fpwe8ny,t1_fpw2d99,1588961906.0,"I don’t know if it helps you to have a name for things, but the delusion that one’s self is dead is called Cotard’s Syndrome. I’ve experienced it before and it was truly awful, and really painful for my spouse to experience second hand. You’re doing good just by trying to be there for him. Many people are scared away by delusions, so it can be hard to keep relationships through psychotic episodes. 

No matter what, though, make sure to take care of yourself. When you’re in a relationship with someone with a serious mental illness it can be easy to let these problems consume you.  While you can support and care for someone with a serious mental illness, you are not responsible for their illness. If they are an adult it is their responsibility to monitor and take care of their illness. Pay attention to your needs and wants. You can’t support another person if you don’t take care of your own needs, too, including taking time or space for yourself."
schizophrenia,fpvxp00,t3_gfttmz,1588953694.0,"These do sound like delusions but that doesn't mean he has schizophrenia. There's also delusional disorder, which is a psychotic disorder typified by having persistent delusions and bizarre beliefs, as well as a number of other psychotic disorders. That doesn't mean you shouldn't ask questions here. I'm mostly saying to not set yourself on a specific diagnosis when there are a number of possibilities. 

You unfortunately can't convince someone with a delusion that the delusion isn't true. When I'm experiencing delusions I find it helpful when the person I'm with validates my experiences, ""I know this feels very real and scary to you..."" before challenging it, such as ""...but this doesn't sound right or true to me."" But it's different when you aren't already aware and haven't accepted that you have a psychotic disorder. In that case, as you've experienced, a number of problems can come up, such as them suspecting that you're taking part in the delusion or are an enemy, and (especially) the delusion becoming more complicated and fixed as they explain why their delusion is real and true. Basically you start thinking more specifically about all of the reasons it must be true, so it becomes much harder to get rid of the delusion when you finally seek treatment. Because of this you can go with simply validating the experience (without saying that it is true), like I mentioned above, without challenging it. 

I hope that's helpful. Be well and good luck!"

I don’t remember what it’s called for auditory things, for visual effects they’re called illusions and they aren’t considered a psychotic symptom. 

But to be honest there isn’t anything you can do to reduce your chance of getting it besides avoiding drugs. If you get it then you get it. That doesn’t mean that your dreams are over. If you’re high functioning then you can certainly be an attorney. One of the more famous individuals with schizophrenia is Elyn Saks, and she’s a an attorney and professor of law in California. 

I know it doesn’t help anxiety to hear this, but since you can’t do anything about it, try to not worry. Live your life like you want to, pursue your goals. If you get schizophrenia then it’ll be a challenge you’ll have to work through at that point, but it’s not the end of the world."
