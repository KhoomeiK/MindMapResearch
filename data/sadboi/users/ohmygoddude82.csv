They saved a spot for me front and center rail. That was one of the best shows of theirs I‚Äôve ever been to. (I‚Äôve seen them way more than just twice) They added an additional upgrade to the VIP ticket, for another $150 you get a meet and greet. I was planning on doing that in Vegas. I just have to wait a little longer. It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve chatted with the guys, should be extra fun now!"
