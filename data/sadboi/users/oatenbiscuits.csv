aspergirls,fo0hnv4,t3_g4xz8q,1587413315.0,"A quick moment of eye contact is used to show that you are aware of them and they of you in that moment , thus allowing for communication to occur . If you give eye contact to someone it just shows that you are aware that they are there whilst allowing them to be aware of you, to make life flow by smoother . Only a quick moment is needed to acknowledge “I see you there!”. In conversation , the same technique is used every few sentences to say “I am paying attention to you” which reassures the speaker and helps things along. It’s like refreshing a page, which only takes a second.  “Still there?” “Yup still there!” Eyes tend to indicate where a persons attention is , either in the environment or in their own mind."

If it’s over 6 months then i would speak with your Doctor about adjusting the dose or changing medications . I wouldn’t attempt it on your own tho bud , speaking from experience it can make you suffer a lot more . If it’s under 6 months or so, I would just keep trying as side effects go away after a while , taking it day by day. Apathy is very common , make sure you’re drinking enough water because dehydration can cause some of those symptoms. Look after yourself - have a shower every day , eat healthy snaccs .
