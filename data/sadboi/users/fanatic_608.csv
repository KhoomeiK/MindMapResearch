DiagnoseMe,fbe2izs,t3_ecoihb,1576776765.0,"Not a dr - but MH social worker. 

What causes your mood swings? Is there any trigger or do they come without any trigger? On average, how long does each swing last for?

In terms of your paranoia? Would you say this is constant or fluctuating? How does it impact on your life? Given that you have labelled it as paranoia am I right in thinking that you have some insight to this that it is part of a mental illness? In your psychotic episodes what do you experience? Any hallucinations? What are the content of these? 

Have you had any psychological treatment and has any of these been helpful?"
flightsim,f8g0zm6,t1_f8frxnu,1574552411.0,I had a great time on your A320 a couple of months back. Planning to come back again but unsure whether to stick to A320 again or try 737 or the Queen...
socialwork,ezx5j6i,t3_d2rhw9,1568232538.0,I usually just state exactly what they said in quotations. And then state if I or they ended it early
bipolar,ewxc1qw,t3_cqekuw,1565852018.0,"Major congrats. One day at a time, you are your own proof you can do it."
socialwork,ewvjugq,t1_ewsnw0t,1565807758.0,Thanks. I’m trying to find my path too. Right now it’s this or becoming/going back to a computer programmer.
socialwork,ewvjq9f,t1_ewryeke,1565807683.0,"Thank you - a step I am planning to do is more self care, but also consider moving to a job like yours where I don’t feel I have so much ownership."
socialwork,ewvj1yo,t1_ews0nxq,1565807269.0,"This makes a lot of sense. I do think that a lot of my expectations for how I should be as a social worker comes from now I feel I was failed at times by mental health services. But I think I need to try and accept that I can only try my best, and that everyone will not always be happy. 

I’m actually seeing my doctor tomorrow - I will discuss anxiety with him. Antidepressants have worked well for my anxiety before, but also, work very well at making me manic!"
socialwork,ewvisl5,t1_ewrjzh5,1565807110.0,"Thank you. I’ve actually been in therapy for about a year. My therapist has helped me get a better view around work - the view being that I am there to do a job, but not work miracles."
socialwork,ewvij9q,t1_ewssib9,1565806951.0,My plan is to start going gym after work every day too.
socialwork,ewvihgz,t1_ewrhrfr,1565806920.0,"Thank you! In my last position I worked more in a team with no allocated cases which alleviated stress, but then also increased my stress sometimes as I would have to pick up on other peoples lack of hard work. 

In my current team I feel that I have been supported to a degree with it. I am a care coordinator so I have a number of cases but they can be seen by our rapid response worker should they need to be.

My team is being restructured at the moment, I think we may move to more shared clients which may help. If not I may consider a move to a team with that model."
