BPD,ffofext,t3_eu7n7t,1580077130.0,"I relate to this so much, the lack of consistent relationships and the fact that I have fond memories of so many people which I cherish and the realisation that the memories that are so dear to me are almost nothing to others,  benign and anecdotal for them while I still sit and think about them is so heartbreaking. 
Its like people are my book and I’m not even a chapter to them."

BPD,ffi8gx3,t1_ffi85ez,1579967802.0,"Also try and draw your own face, or take a picture of yourself without filters or makeup and then look at it after a few days. 
Having a fixed routine also helps. Making observable changes to yourself through exercise, colouring your hair the colour you want, wearing what you want etc will also enhance your sense of self."

BorderlinePDisorder,ff87234,t3_es6p1s,1579667833.0,"Yes, makes me feel jealous and left out, makes me ignore the fact that I too have friends and achievements and go into this loop of thinking they are better than me and out of my league and will abandon me, I feel a compulsive need to be included in that sphere of their life with an overwhelming fear that all the good things in their life will make them see right through me and make them realise I’m not good enough.
I haven’t been able to overcome this and hence always get dumped, my thoughts and essentially become a self-fulfilling prophecy."

I remember traveling a lot and lots of family dinners but it was a charade we’d put on for the world, I never really developed people skills or a personality I feel, maybe if I was allowed to or encouraged to make friends when I was younger it would’ve been different."
