FreeCompliments,fqja6pz,t3_gishei,1589407138.0,Congrats!
FreeCompliments,fqj9nam,t3_gj0ni2,1589406927.0,Good on you for leaving that marriage! I've been with abusive women myself and it's no fun at all! Good luck putting yourself out there again I wish you the best of luck!
FreeCompliments,fqj95wn,t3_girj8v,1589406743.0,Nothing to be self conscious about! A plain girl? Not at all! Perhaps it's the glasses but you look like you are intelligent and really friendly! Like you go out of your way to make other people happy. I could be wrong but that's just based on how you look to me.
FreeCompliments,fqj8g9e,t3_gj1m43,1589406470.0,"Everything you mentioned your teeth, your eyes, your face, these things I can't see at all! You look really pretty! Not a joke at all!"
SuicideWatch,fpc4z7r,t1_fpbtd75,1588487781.0,I like you. One of the greatest writers no one's ever heard of.
SuicideWatch,fpc4vd2,t1_fpbm7vd,1588487681.0,I never heard of visual novels before! This sounds so interesting. I've always been interested in new forms of storytelling I will definitely check this out thank you for telling me about this.
SuicideWatch,fpc4dwm,t1_fpb0xl9,1588487219.0,Oh wow thank you for saying this and thank you for watching it all. That is so incredible to hear that something I did motivated someone else to do something. I'm glad you pushing through and working on a passion project!
SuicideWatch,fpbqb0n,t1_fpaaww6,1588476063.0,"Ok...this made me a bit emotional...I looked up to her so much as a kid. I can't express to you how much. Harry Potter was so cool to me. She was like my absolute hero. I had forgotten she was in a similar place as I currently am. It's honestly been years since I thought about Harry Potter. But you're right she probably felt similar feelings, thought similar thoughts, had similar headaches, cried similar tears when she was my age. It's like seeing her footsteps on this path I'm going down. I'll try to look around for the message ""JK Rowling was here"" scrawled onto the walls of these dark moods if I end up getting lost in them again. Thank you for this comment."
SuicideWatch,fpboqe6,t3_gcb0sp,1588474959.0,"Ok...oh my God...this is not the response I was expecting at all....I was only venting in this post I didn't expect this reaction - who could? I almost forgot I made this post it was purely out of frustration. I come back a few hours later and...I just really want to say thank you so much to everyone...this is crazy! I got 100 likes on the video - I honest to God wasn't expecting even 10 people to click on that link if anyone at all. I'll try to respond to everyone as soon as I can. I am finding myself with a lot of messages right now. It's a bit overwhelming but I'm certainly not complaining. This is crazy I'm so appreciative of this response thank you all so much for all these kind words. Anyways I'll try to respond everyone as soon as I can there's also a few messages in my inbox I have to get to. To be honest I have had really bad social anxiety all throughout my life I always fret with messaging other people about each word I use ha ha it might be a little bit. But I'll try to get back to everyone as soon as I can. I was expecting maybe one comment, maybe two. Not 37! Thank you again!

Edit: There's 50+ comments I'd like to respond to each one but I'm not sure I'm able to. I'd be up all night. I really hope no one's upset by this and people understand. I hope they see this message thanking them because I really mean that for each comment."
