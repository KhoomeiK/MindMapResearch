I know its scary and seems impossible, but you will learn a lot about yourself. You'll be able to grow into your own person. You aren't the experiences that you've had. Living away from home will honestly do wonders for your self confidence and character. Where are you from?"

We are such social creatures and absolutely need human contact. Even in a time of crisis, contact with others is what keeps us going. But, it definitely would be much more enjoyable to be locked away in a mansion with a pool and beautiful gardens and many different rooms to spend time in, all while not worrying about money. They definitely have it better, but it's still not easy."

Also, a whole lot of people who arent traditionally eligible for unemployment are still waiting to find out what they have done for them, because they are supposedly working on it, but no word on that either. I totally understand the website being dodgy because of the high traffic. But, people are panicking because they aren't going to file in time to get benefits right away, she needed to address that."
