conlangs,fimphoj,t3_f8o0c3,1582541461.0,"That's interesting. A mixture of Japanese Hiragana and ....Simplified Chinese characters..?

I do know that Simplified Chinese characters are..not well liked for some people, so the history of that simplification and people's feelings are... things to research and choose your own feelings about, for sure, if you've not already done so.

Still a nicely creative combo, especially with some of those Hiragana not having the exact same sonic value that they do in Japanese. I don't know enough Chinese of any kind (or the readings of enough Japanese kanji) to know what the readings for the characters are, but I wonder if you've varied those also. That would be neat, too. :)"
WritingPrompts,fimnv5s,t1_fim8x2m,1582539135.0,"Having looked both ""scrabble"" and ""purchase"" up in the dictionary, ""scrabbled for purchase"" is a valid phrase; it's just not used very much.

If this helps any, the relevant definitions from the New Oxford American Dictionary are:

scrabble | ˈskrabəl | verb *\[no* *object\]* scratch or grope around with one's fingers to find, collect, or hold on to something: *she scrabbled at the grassy slope, desperate for a* *firm* *grip*. **•** (of an animal) scratch at something with its claws: *a dog was scrabbling at the door*. **•** *\[with* *adverbial of direction\]* scramble or crawl quickly: *lizards scrabbling across the walls*. **•** make great efforts to get somewhere or achieve something: *I had to scrabble around to find this apartment*.

purchase | ˈpərCHəs |

noun **2** a hold or position on something for applying power advantageously, or the advantage gained by such application: *the horse's hooves fought for purchase on the slippery pavement* | *\[in* *singular\]* *:*  *an attempt to gain a purchase on the soft earth*. **•** a block and tackle.

ETA: the relevant definitions, and fixing a typo."

Why do I think there's a whole lot of baloney that can be hidden because they barely have to record things.

I'm just..this law is abusive and horrendous. Yes, folks need access to help, but this isn't any way to help anyone. Seems like a punishment for being mentally ill, which isn't a choice someone makes."

I'd say that you should do you. If Ayumi Hamasaki (J-pop artist) or Michael Jackson can release different songs that fit into different genres, I'm sure it's fine.

There's probably an advantage to making sure any given release functions as a whole, though (as in the whole thing flows well like a lovely, well-made playlist, if nothing else)."
