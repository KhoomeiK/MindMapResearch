relationship_advice,fldz427,t3_fo9em6,1585074524.0,"We are humans and unfortunately we dont get to choose who to fall in love with. Now you are asking when does the pain stop? Well first of all you have to forget about Adam, everyone falls in love, your little obsession as you call it is not that bad, you did not hurt anyone expect yourself but you can use it to learn from your mistake and grow to be a better person. You shouldn't feel guilty because as I said you dont control your feelings. Its like the same way a thought that says you to kill someone or steal something passes by. Well you did not control it, our mind is weird and the hormone level changes time to time. Now lets go back to Adam, you simply should forget about it, just say it wasn't mean to be, dont say stuff like he is bad and he did hurt you( I cant know anything about that nor do I care) that will make you just think more, just say it wasn't mean to be and maybe it wasnt even love. Focus on your new plans and dont hold hope into the past. Its okay if you have held hope. In the end we are humans and sometimes hope is all we have. But as time passes wounds heal and the flames that burned us dont burn anymore. Think it as beautiful pain, pain that helped you grow and have better chances, and as they say pain never goes away but you just learn how to live with it and one day its just gone. You shouldn't feel guilty, you havent done any bad thing, from what I read you only wanted to feel appreciated and loved, hey but look maybe you can get the love that you deserve from the other guy now."
