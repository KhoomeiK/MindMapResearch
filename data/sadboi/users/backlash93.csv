woodworking,ewh9x7j,t3_cobsbv,1565401921.0,"I made this my final year of college for a fine woodworking program I was involved in. The top and aprons are ash, with a maple under structure and legs. The wedges for the stretches are walnut. This bench is also completely knockdown, meaning I can pop the wedges and a few bolts loose and it all breaks down small enough to fit in the trunk of a car. It was a fun design challenge. 

This is it on display in one of the galleries at the school of art, as part of an end of the year exhibit we out on of all of the work we made that year. Yes I made this, no it’s not in a museum. Can prove it tomorrow when I go into the shop if necessary haha."

I would really recommend looking him and his worn up, and if you are interested in it, you should read any of his books. “A Cabinetmakers notebook” was one of the books that really got me into fine woodworking."

woodworking,ew5wwy8,t1_ew5w4zl,1565147229.0,"It’s a statement piece for the shop. When customers come in they want to see what the type of cabinetry is they’re getting. What you put in the cabinet can be whatever you want, and just because it’s a style of cabinet that is more traditionally residential I don’t see how it’s any different from a normal faceframe cabinet with shaker doors that someone uses as a tool cabinet. So what if it’s fancy, if you can make it why shouldn’t you use it for whatever you want?"

We have been in and out of touch over the last 10 or so years but we always seem to be there when the other needs a kick in the butt to move on to bigger and better things. We roomed together in college after accidentally attending the same university and living 30 feet from one another, then we went out separate ways for a few years, now we’re both at a point where we want to move on to bigger and better opportunities. Having friends like that is something that is few and far between and is often taken for granted. Cherish it and together you guys can accomplish anything!"
oddlysatisfying,eqstip2,t3_bze4tr,1560293409.0,"I actually know this guy! I went on a professional development trip with my art school at uni to New York and got to tour his studio in DUMBO just south of the Manhattan bridge at the time. He is a genuinely nice guy, and loved to answer all of our questions about everything from his artistic process to being a full time artist in NY. He also makes amazing water towers out of the same colored glass/plastic. They can be found all over NY including on top of the studio building he was in when I visited.

When I was there that day he even joined our student group and showed us around the DUMBO district, including some of its galleries and whatnot, we even got to have lunch with him! Genuinely great artist and human being, is really highly suggest following him on Instagram, he’s fairly active and is doing some amazing work."
