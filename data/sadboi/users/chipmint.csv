BPD,ff4p9dn,t3_eqrdtd,1579569150.0,"I'm dealing with this right now. I feel like I'm hurting my own self by being so attached to my partner. I always love and care too much, more than they do. Since this is still a relatively new relationship, I understand why he wants to take his time and figure out how much he likes me. But I cant get my brain to understand. I want it all to stop. I want off of this BPD emotional rollercoaster."

BPD,fdsgq48,t1_fdsfd7c,1578702403.0,Oh man. Having no notice is so hard. I wish I had something encouraging to say that could help you and I both. Hopefully the next few days will fly by.

BPD,fdoolx0,t3_emegsr,1578609428.0,"You're not alone. I'm experiencing the exact same thing and I hate it. I always wish I could be ""normal"". My guy knows I have BPD and has researched it a lot since we started dating. He has studied me to recognize when I'm not okay. If theres going to be an extended amount of time between texts, he tries to tell me. If hes driving from his friends out of town, he calls me. Even with all that, I still think the worst. He will tell me all the reasons why he adores me and I respond by saying hes just trying to make me feel good about myself. When he hangs out with his friends, I feel rejected. When we're together, I'm on top of the world. It's a never ending cycle."

BPD,f94bae4,t1_f93zgpt,1575082908.0,"Anytime I bring up seeing him speaking to other people, he's always telling me they are just friends. We've been discussing moving forward with a relationship. He says hes not 100% ready to yet. When I say I'm going to go look for someone who's ready to date, he gets upset and says that I'm not being patient."
