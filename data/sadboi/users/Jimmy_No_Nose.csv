CoronavirusRecession,forbj3p,t3_g91ksq,1588009435.0,"Having heath insurance currently isn’t all that great. Sure. I completely feel for the ones losing it but we can’t be seen. My daughters dental surgery was canceled, my wife has been dealing with an issue for almost a month and a half now and it takes more then a week for a single reply, my oldest son physical is delayed and no call for a reschedule. Yet. I pay per month for the same type of health insurance for a complete decrease in care. It’s absolutely mind blowing.

UPMC in my area has a total of 6 cases in our county. Yet. We have multiple offices closed. Nurses working from home and thinking this is more a vacation. Our town doctor was seen on our local Bike trail, like wtf?! You have people needing seen, needing surgery. Yet if it’s not an absolute emergency your put on hold.

So again. I completely feel for the ones being laid off but trust me. As one of the ones currently with still health insurance, it’s not any better."

rheumatoidarthritis,fn8ox7d,t3_g04jem,1586746604.0,"Thank you all for the comments. I really appreciate them. She had blood work done at UPMC and it usually marks with an “!” When things are abnormal. So far the results look normal. Her b-12 test was around 270 but it was on the low range of the “Pass” marker.

I figured B-12 as well but no one has really contacted us. They want to set her up with xrays and MRI or whatever a normal test is for neurological but they stressed that this wouldn’t happened until after covid-19.

It’s kinda scary and I really didn’t think of the impact of normal hospital visits and appointments being basically put on hold. The reason why I’m trying to do some of my own research. And well. Doing research online you could guess I get anything from B-12 to stage 4 cancer, to HIV lol. Keep safe everyone"

movies,f2hfxzp,t3_dd0ynj,1570243160.0,"Just seen this movie tonight And I loved it. Joaquin Phoenix joker was outstanding. Reminds me of the early 80’s / 90’s joker. The movement, the laugh, it was spot on. Heath Ledger’s joker was amazing but I believe that’s in a different category. His was more modern. In my opinion. Both guys absolutely and completely nailed the joker. Best all time.

The ending of the joker is not that confusing. I believe he did everything and here is why. It’s in the same world as Batman. You even see Bruce as a kid and his parents. It’s Gotham, it’s basically exactly the same world. I would also assume Joker is in Arkham asylum which everyone knows he always escapes. 

The movie makes you question if you can believe the joker and what he is saying at all times because it’s just that. You can’t ever fully trust him. Which makes the audience member question themselves. It’s 
Beautifully directed. Well done."

Madden,f00tt2h,t3_d38chc,1568306358.0,"I guess my original post was taken as I upped the difficulty so obviously it gets harder. For example. MLB the show has a mode where as you play and beat the AI the game automatically adjusts the sliders so you have a Authentic experience.

I quite literally moved up one difficulty and the AI is completely predictable. I throw a pass to a WR, 3-4 steps ahead, AI will speed up to block it. I throw a pass it’s caught the same animation shows up dropping it after getting hit. I can almost call it every single time. It makes the experience completely predictable and almost cheep. Like the AI system is a set outcome before almost like spinning a wheel.

I know this game has massive fans and will defend this game which is fine. Maybe it’s just not for me. I only get maddens every few years and this was the same issue I had years ago. MLB the show had one of the best authentic difficulty that actually scaled up based on YOUR performance."
