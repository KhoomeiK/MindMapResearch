The thing to keep in mind is you are both in a very confusing situation, together. So, understanding and compassion are key. Just giving the other person extra time to answer a question or a little help with triggers - I, for instance, need quiet during my episodes. (I call them attacks.) Noises make it hard for me to think. And my wife is sensitive to that. So, communication is also a key.

As with any disease, there will be good days and bad days. Knowing what makes the good days good and the bad days bad will go a long way towards helping you both get through them. Again, communication is key.

Listen, everyone does things in their life that they regret. Some regret the tiniest things because they think they're great big things - I'm one of those. But everyone has regrets no matter what they do, which makes our disease not all that different from the life everyone experiences, just moreso (perhaps). But history is long and life can often feel pretty long. And it is helpful to take the long view and understand your life in some context and help put things into perspective, so you can begin to see anything you did as just the way life went without cursing yourself for it.

I'm an atheist and I try to live a fact-based life without magical thinking. But I was once a born-again Christian and I beleived all sorts of things about my disease that had nothing at all to do with reality. (I wasn't diagnosed until very late in life.)
