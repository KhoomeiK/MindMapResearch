books,fqmii7v,t1_fqmffhn,1589478005.0,Maybe I'm just finding it to be a slow start and it's gonna pick up.
books,fqm63cl,t1_fqm5my1,1589472133.0,"Well, I think since now I'm receiving comments from younger people who loved it, I'll keep reading. If I'm not hooked by page, say 200, I'll just move on. If I am hooked, then great."
books,fqlt8yu,t3_gjcx8h,1589465638.0,Probably The Kite Runner. Really really sad book.
books,fqlt60q,t3_gj6l3i,1589465593.0,I read this in 7th grade. 2007. I think this was the book that made me like reading. It's one of my favorite books of all time.
StrangerThings,fqls8bw,t3_gj8o73,1589465083.0,KFC is a big guilty pleasure. And Eggos are actually pretty good.
StrangerThings,fqaytuz,t3_ggq0tv,1589227630.0,This seems to happen to a lot of people who watch the show. It just speaks to people. I fell deeply into the show hole right after season 2. This is a very real feeling. It'll pass though. You'll still love the show but you won't feel actually depressed about it. I can't speak for anyone else though.
StrangerThings,fqaw301,t3_ghqkox,1589226291.0,I can't not vote for The Gate since it's my favorite episode of the series so far. But I also love Trick or Treat Freak. The Spy and The Mind Flayer are also great episodes. And Madmax is an underrated episode. I love season 2.
StrangerThings,fqavnhk,t3_ghqivf,1589226074.0,Hard decision.
StrangerThings,fpmbvbu,t3_gdusef,1588729721.0,The 4 boys by far. What about Mike and Will?
movies,fplniji,t3_ge6to5,1588715937.0,I was surprised when I read that Ang Lee directed Sense and Sensibility.
movies,fplmqis,t1_fplgvel,1588715522.0,I feel exactly the same way. I thought it was so overrated. I love horror and I loved Hereditary. I was disappointed by this.
movies,fpllk0m,t3_ge2qyq,1588714900.0,"Finding Nemo is my favorite of all time. It always brings back a special memory for me. I was 8 years old when it came out. I didn't see it in theaters but my whole family watched it in our living room when it came out on video. My parents were together. We were happy. It was a good time. I absolutely loved the movie and the whole adventure. I've seen it a million times over the years. And it's just always great. I love the relationship and chemistry between Marlin and Dory, and I love Nemos storyline in the fish tank. It always makes me cry. The first three Toy Story movies are tied for my second favorite."
AskReddit,fplk25g,t1_fpljmox,1588714115.0,What flavor?

OldSchoolCelebs,fpkym5b,t3_gdwdzt,1588703294.0,"She was so beautiful. What they did to her, her unborn child and her friends was barbaric and I hope they've suffered for all this time since."
StrangerThings,fpdfxpx,t3_gcqzq7,1588526218.0,"Overrated-Eleven, Steve, Robin, Barb, Alexei (I don’t dislike them) and underrated-Lucas, Mike"
StrangerThings,fozvndb,t1_fozsvd4,1588197671.0,"You know, that's just sad. The writers completely wrecked what they built in the first two seasons. What a waste. There was so much fan fiction for Mileven after season 2 came out. For months, I read so many cute and touching fan fics. Everyone was so invested."
StrangerThings,fozsfd6,t1_fozs6ua,1588196052.0,Yeah. I've read a lot of fan fiction since season 2 and a lot of it is better than what we got in season 3.
StrangerThings,fozrxcq,t1_fozrrh0,1588195803.0,I know. So disappointing. If only we could've written the season instead.
StrangerThings,fozp5ex,t3_g9qo0n,1588194426.0,"* Both Barb and Alexei are way overhyped. Bob and Benny were better.
* I love Steve but he's a little overhyped too.
* I like The Lost Sister episode.
* Season 2 is better than season 3.
* The Neverending Story sequence is terrible and dumb.
* Mike is my favorite character.
* Eleven is a little overrated, in general.
* I don't like Erica and don't find her funny. (Is that unpopular?)"
StrangerThings,foznge6,t3_gaecgi,1588193595.0,"Sadly, season 2 was a better season for Mileven than season 3. And they had like three scenes together."
StrangerThings,fost0s9,t3_g9b370,1588037439.0,"I know exactly what you mean! I felt this way when the season came out, and I still feel a similar feeling now. It's like a mix of happiness and sadness."
StrangerThings,folh5zq,t3_g7lj6s,1587862134.0,"A few scenes that come to mind:

* That scene with Eleven's leg at the beginning of 3x08. Imo, Millie's acting in that scene was not only her best in the series, but just one of the best pieces of acting I've ever seen. Felt so so real.
* Hopper leaving a message for El in 2x06, in the car. David's acting was so good.
* Finn nailed the scene when El comes back at the end of 2x08, His face. And his scene with David at the beginning of 2x09.
* Will seizure in hospital. Season 2."
StrangerThings,fofpw6h,t3_g79b4n,1587740692.0,Ugh this is my favorite moment. Gets me every time.
StrangerThings,fofm5dv,t1_fo7ea5c,1587738722.0,"Yeah, well, that's just, like, your opinion, man. Lol."
StrangerThings,fo95qpd,t3_g5mgw5,1587611165.0,Definitely Lucas.
StrangerThings,fnr2ozr,t3_g2xkei,1587177855.0,Amazing job on the eyes and hair

StrangerThings,fnfj9ms,t3_g1gz4m,1586909128.0,I hated Suzie's scene. And I definitely wouldn't like it if she came back.
StrangerThings,fnfj0v9,t3_g1g64s,1586908990.0,Brenner.
StrangerThings,fnf0sv4,t3_g149fg,1586899329.0,It's heartbreaking. :(
StrangerThings,fn8m3fr,t1_fn8lqm3,1586744783.0,It felt like a true sequel to season 1. Season 3 did not.
StrangerThings,fn8eklo,t3_fzz6rq,1586739882.0,Season 1 is the best and the gold standard.
StrangerThings,fn8egu1,t1_fn70vz2,1586739818.0,"It's generally the least favorite among everyone. But, I like it much more than season 3."
StrangerThings,fn8eckk,t1_fn878gt,1586739744.0,"That scene with her leg in the beginning of 3x08 is her best acting to date, imo."
StrangerThings,fn503ns,t1_fn4ydl6,1586652798.0,I had way better expectations. I know you don't have much faith in further seasons. And I honestly don't either. But I still have hope lol
StrangerThings,fn4zu5j,t3_fzevb1,1586652623.0,Great scene. Too bad season 3 kind of tarnished it.
StrangerThings,fn080in,t1_fn07nr2,1586537089.0,Also love the lazy boy scene.
StrangerThings,fn07x8f,t1_fn07nr2,1586537042.0,"Yes. When he comes back to the closet, you can tell she is so relieved. Season 1 was magic."
StrangerThings,fmzyhbr,t3_fy7976,1586532071.0,"I'd personally add the scene when they're walking on the tracks behind Dustin and Lucas. 1x03. When he doesn't want to admit to her that Troy bullies him. She says ""Mike, I understand."" And he says ""Ok cool."" She says ""cool"" and smiles at him and he smiles back. It's such a sweet moment and I think it's when he starts to really like her. He realizes she likes him for him."
StrangerThings,fmzy2i5,t3_fy7vg1,1586531845.0,"Happy birthday, David. :) You're the best."
StrangerThings,fmud2d9,t3_fx89em,1586389023.0,"Even though season 3 is my least favorite, I'm still very attached. I agree about the attachment to the show and the characters. This show is special."
StrangerThings,fmr4clk,t3_fwh3mv,1586313589.0,A few months after season 1 came out. Around September/October 2016.
loneliness,fmr0xjw,t1_fmqu2ey,1586311349.0,I'm living with family. So I agree. It's nice to be with my family and spend more time with them. I'm glad I have them.
dating,fmn9xzo,t3_fvdor7,1586221333.0,Me neither. I've been single my whole life. I'll be 25 in July. It's time for me not to be lonely anymore.
StrangerThings,fmn2ngo,t3_fvxxws,1586216919.0,"Can't believe season 2 is dead last. I love all 3 soundtracks but season 2 had great songs like Girls on Film, Runaway, Islands in the Stream, Wango Tango, etc. And the OST had Eulogy, Eight Fifteen, The First Lie, The Return, etc. Amazing soundtrack. Season 1 had an unbelievable OST too."
StrangerThings,fmda18y,t3_ftyxgr,1585962744.0,"2x09, The Gate is my favorite episode of the series so far."
StrangerThings,fmd9ur1,t3_fuipzi,1585962621.0,"Eleven saving Mike from the quarry at the end of 1x06/the group hug, Mike and El's reunion, the snowball.

StrangerThings,flpp5kh,t3_fq85lb,1585365028.0,I don't think they look alike at all. They just both have dark hair.
books,flm9ctf,t1_flm81og,1585277688.0,"I didn't think so. I loved the ending with the kite. However, it could've been a little more hopeful, than just a half a smile from Sohrab. Sohrab, a 10 year old,  attempting suicide and then not really speaking or doing anything for a year was a bit too much and too depressing. Maybe the saddest thing I've read in a book."
books,flm29mv,t1_flm1f2u,1585272913.0,"I'll definitely try his other books. But, probably not for a while. I could go into a depression lol."
StrangerThings,fli1k7z,t3_fotdj1,1585173546.0,"Season 1 is the best, by far. And I think it's my personal favorite. But, idk, I really love season 2 also. Season 3 is my least favorite but I don't hate it."
movies,flf7ftw,t1_flf5q9l,1585099730.0,Before Midnight was definitely my least favorite though. Sunrise and Sunset were really good.
BingeEatingDisorder,fl2sqzg,t1_fl2ok54,1584758948.0,I always feel so guilty. But I can't stop with going through these binges. It's a terrible cycle.
Anxiety,fkwbroi,t3_fkzyzk,1584588239.0,"I feel the same. I've been feeling very anxious and on edge for days because of this. Now I've been having chest pain and definitely think I have GERD, which is caused by anxiety. It's all been too much. But today, I noticed I was starting to feel just a teeny bit better, because I've been avoiding the news and social media as much as I can. And just know that the number of cases is very very small, when you think about the world population. And quarantine will prevent a lot of cases. And this will pass. Hopefully soon. We got this."
Anxiety,fkrwj0u,t3_fkayil,1584477447.0,"Yes! For the past few days. It's been awful. Just telling myself ""It's just your anxiety/panic attacks"" makes me feel a little better. And I feel like I have a load of stress to release."

books,fiqhahw,t1_fiqg8la,1582644295.0,"Well I do agree that it was a slow build. And the first half is not quite as riveting as the second, even though I liked it all. Sometimes, a slow build is good and I think it was in this case. I just thought King's take on the whole vampire aspect was so interesting and I thought the whole threat in the town was genuinely stressful. I cared about all the main characters and was scared for who Barlow might take next."

My grandpa was obsessed all through her childhood and now she’s done it to me. I don’t want to do it to my kids in the future.
