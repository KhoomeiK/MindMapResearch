And I still felt like it was possible that _I_ was the one making it weird. This is a trap.

Couple weeks back I filed my HR complaints, dropped the mic and quit my job for a better one. Good riddance to married men (usually twice your age and allegedly in 'open relationships') who can't help but make everything weird.

At the end of the day OP, these interactions are making you uncomfortable and you should err on the side of 'he's the one making it weird'. Hopefully you find an outlet to end his inappropriate contact.

In high school (15yo) I was with a boy who watched a lot of anime etc. I broke it off / it never existed to begin with because I found his behaviour to be borderline stalkerish / obsessive. Years later, I have been informed that he's liked lolita hentai pages from his personal Facebook. This doesn't surprise me. I consider him to be the creepy / probably has pedophilic tendencies kind and that's part of the reason that he chose me.

Conversely, my current boyfriend loves me for me and finds me sexy and cute. He hasn't shown any prior weird behaviour so I put his attraction to me in the healthy category. He does appreciate short, round / curvy women, although I'm not super curvy.

I mean us babyfaces have got to accept that somebody is just plain attracted to us, otherwise how else are we going to function! I totally understand where you're coming from though. I too have the dual thoughts of 'these are grown women with autonomy and sex appeal' and 'if people sexualise those who look 12, there's something wrong with them'.

I also want to throw in that I'm in Japan right now, and have visited a manga shop with a hentai section, and straight up about 10% of the covers were children. Besides the fact that every girl in anime + hentai look maximum 15 anyway, these were like 7 year olds with no pubic development. It's absolutely disgusting."

For me it's also bleeding over to being paranoid about people in public will try to rob/rape/stab me and any erratic behaviour I automatically assume is caused by drugs, drinking, or dangerous mental illness.

I have actually seen my mum once early on after NC, sitting down on a bridge I have to cross to get home. I only saw her legs as she was sort of behind a sign, and I don't believe she saw me. I legged it the other direction and called my bf's parents to come pick me up after running/speedwalking across half the city.

I've been working with my psychologist for a few months now (not specifically on this, but it's helped my mental state a lot). In line with my current no contact, I have decided if I see them I will completely ignore their existence and get out as fast as I can. If they press for communication / try to block my exit I have a script that I developed with my psych:

Wide stance, shoulders back. Firm and loud: 
- ""NO!""
- ""Don't follow me.""
- ""Don't talk to me.""

These statements are meant to show your boundaries, but also alert other people around you that you are in danger.
