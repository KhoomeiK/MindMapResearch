It’s so weird. Cause first I’m SO hungry. Then I eat, maybe tear up a lil n start hating myself. Ed thoughts always come back so quick...

May get better on summer tho i was freezing last summer too wearing hoodies, scarf jacket n big clothes like that, so idk, depends how i eat n if able to gain any real weight. If i eat properly im warm that little while i can get food down. 
And omg lol u don’t only get dizzy, feel like ur gonna faint, legs n hands shaking, see black  stars like in things in ur vision from just being hungry. Ppl at normal weights don’t get that weak so easily. My body is eating itself obviously I know that. Heart palpitations n other bs that mentioned but i don’t seem to care enough. 

Yep nicotine helps w hunger that’s my main reason doing it. Scared of weed as i’d most likely end up binging n purging.. Some w ana use it to b sble to eat but for me it’s just waste of money n triggering, at least rn, n has been like that for a long time.

Love peanut butter but recently i’ve started to fear fat (and other things like carbs) pretty hard again. Rn fasting as long as i can, 3rd n freezing but oh well. Then back to restriction. Bought a kitchen scale too not too long ago so i can finally count my calories.

No idea y im tellin u all this, eds’re so complex n near damn impossible to explain to someone who’s not a dr or doesn’t have personal experiense.

Just did some cardio. I know I shouldn’t it’ll just make my chest n other pains worse, but I wanted to distract myself from fapping. For now at least..

Honestly one of the only rare things that has been keeping me going is that if I relapse then I’ve even less energy, can’t exercise, can’t control n lose more weight. Exactly the opposite I should be doing, it’s sick yep I know.🙄🤷🏻‍♂️

Dear lord I wish I could go on a date without freaking out n not having to think I must get in bed with the guy. Altho guys’re most often problematic like that. Horny mfs.. The fear doesn’t come out of nowhere u know..
