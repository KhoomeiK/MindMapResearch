LDR,fpci3gi,t3_gco0pv,1588501354.0,"I hate to say this but dating an adult man significantly older than you when you're a minor is not very sensible. And the fact that you threatened him with something like that shows the relationship itself has potential to be extremely unhealthy. You shouldn't be saying something like that to guilt him into staying if he wants to leave. Besides, if he  knows your real age then why would he want to date a minor? It's questionable. As long as you're 100% sure it's safe and that he doesn't have any ulterior motives and you're not sending him anything explicit. But don't kill yourself over something like that. You've never met him and you're really young. You'll find someone else if you break up. 

I get LDRs because I'm in one at the moment, but don't ponder letting your life end because it didn't work out. I wish you all the best"

Long story short, we eased into it. Trust me, you'll be so comfortable with them five minutes in and you'll find lots to talk about. The thing is, it all depends on how you interact with each other.

Relationships don't have to be formed on the basis of whether making physical contact with someone is possible or not. Think of it as making a pen pal or if someone you knew in real life moved away...you still maintain that relationship without being able to touch them. I get that online relationships can not last or can be built upon lies but the main reason I see them as real is because tangibility doesn't form a relationship.
