festivals,fqulgki,t1_fq8utsc,1589660810.0,"Naive, skewed version of the world if you think every poor/homeless person deserves a charity. Some of those people create their own suffering and then become complacent in the life they live. They don't love their life but they sure as hell aren't motivated to change it. How about donating to people who can't afford their own medical bills? People who can't afford rent and are potentially about to become homeless while trying to feed their family?"

trees,fh3z5ie,t1_fh36gxy,1581273689.0,"Or people just don't talk about it? Some people are already aware of all of that and just move past the fakeness instead of getting stuck on it because they understand it's just part of the entertainment world. Those people choose to live the lives they do and be the YouTube entertainers they are. If people like their fakeness, more power to them. Just because somebody may be a smoker does not necessarily mean they are on this higher level of thinking than somebody who does not. People like me are already hyper analytical who don't need weed to think about these things. Then when I do smoke, it just turns into paranoid delusions and hypothetical situations that will never occur. Weed does not affect everybody the same nor does it offer some higher level of knowledge. It is a good way to look at things from another perspective but it is not some mystical drug that allows people to tap into some higher state of consciousness and immediately become more intelligible and ""woke"" than non smokers. It just allows people to get out of their own head and realize sometimes we don't always pay attention to our surroundings because we are so caught up in our daily lives and battles."

ADHD,fg5rvtu,t1_fg3cta7,1580536582.0,"Personally, my meds helped me with this! I am taking adderall 7.5mg IR. I feel like when I started to get that overwhelmed freezing on my meds I notice I tell myself ""yes it's overwhelming but this all stuff you know how to do. It just takes time and that's okay"" and next thing you know I catch myself busting out my work without thinking too hard about! I feel like my medication helps me to realize I'm freezing about being overwhelmed because I'm thinking about it so much you know? I just try to tell myself not to think about the start too much because then I end up falling back into the same pattern. Sometimes, I feel like it's easy to rely a lot on the medication, especially once you get used to it. I have to remind myself it's just the aid and not the person doing the task. I do the task, not the medication, and I am capable.

I try to be uplifting but then if I let go too far with the thinking I just end up freezing anyways lol. However, I do find that I will catch myself freezing and realize it and move on to a new task because as long as I am getting something done, I am doing something. Regardless of how minimal or petty I feel the task to be"
2007scape,ffh2vyw,t1_ffh030u,1579921640.0,"Hey man. from somebody who struggles with bad thoughts and the same urges too I'll tell you that i don't think it'll be worth it. You'll never be able to experience anything ever again and if that means one good thing a year, than I'd live for it. Shit, maybe that one thing is like EDC or Tomorrowland or some other music festival or whatever you're into.

Also, MDMA can be so horribly neurotoxic when taken too often. Just remember that it may not be something wrong with you but simply a result of choices you made whole being younger. Our brain still develops past our 20s and drugs really can change the way it works. I have done plenty of drugs in my time and am 23 now and am realizing how much I changed after a year of nose diving back into psychedelics. 
As fun as drugs are, they really do change us. We just can't always see it but we always feel it. 

Take it day by day my friend because if you can make it past today, there's a chance you'll make it through tomorrow. You never know who you'll meet that could change your life. Life is full of weird interactions and very much so feels like living in part of a video game. Why quit the biggest video game you can play early when you have a chance to unlock end game content? It's hard as fuck but it sure as hell is worth it if you make it worth it.

I love you brother and I am sure I am not the only one in this subreddit who could say that. Never written a message out for somebody like this but your life is worth it buddy. Feel free to message me if you need somebody"

electricdaisycarnival,f7jwhk4,t1_f7jdv1t,1573788292.0,"...... yes..... they set their own food prices..... even then, most times it is a company who has purchased a vendor slot in the festival. They pay to be there and charge their own prices for their food based off of food costs, payroll, and a percentage is typically still taken out of the costs to go to the company putting on the festival. Also, a whole team of security is not a contractor. That's a contracted company. Each individual security guard is not a ""contractor."" They work for a company in which the company pays them an hourly wage to be there at the event."

bipolar,f3dydhf,t3_dgmn7n,1570850799.0,"Always worth mentioning. No need to be terrified. You will not be be legally ordered to go to a psych ward just because you may be in psychosis (as far as I know.)

My psychiatrist told me I was in a state of psychosis when I mentioned how I was paranoid of people out to get me. Coworkers scheming plans to get me in trouble, family members plotting things behind my back, convinced somebody was basically always trying to kill me. Any time the door bell rang, I would basically either freeze up or start getting panicky. When I was younger, I used to run upstairs and hide under my blankets. As I have gotten older, I have learned to tell myself to relax because it could just be an Amazon package and it may not be somebody going to kill me as soon as I open it. I still don't answer the door if I am not expecting anybody though.

I also was hallucinating when taking small doses of adderall as prescribed (20mg xr in the am, 10mg ir in the afternoon.) I was seeing shadow people, sounds distorted when I hear them. What could be a printer or someone dropping something sounding like an instrument or some sort of melody. Hearing people call my name and asking everybody at work if they called my name and nobody did. 

I would mention your concerns and just ask him if it's anything to worry about. My psychiatrist prescribed me seroquel and it has virtually killed all of my paranoia since."
bipolar,f3adcmn,t3_dg7vb1,1570768915.0,"I've struggled with paranoia since high school when I started using psychedelics. It became part of my life and I learned to accept it. When I saw the psychiatrist and finally told him, he said it needed to be taken care of before it manifests into a full blown psychosis. He put me on Seroquel and I never thought my paranoia would go away but my lord, this Seroquel helped. I would definitely make an appointment and get the paranoia addressed. Your QOL will increase once you realize you're not thinking everybody is out to get you all of the time. I still get some triggers every once in a while but it's not the constant walking on eggshells like I used to have."
