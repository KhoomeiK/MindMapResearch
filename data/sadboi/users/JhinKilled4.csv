So, I'm a student who filed my 2019 tax return through TurboTax. On my tax forms I filed myself as an independent as I do pay for my part of living costs. I gave them direct deposit info to receive my tax return.

My mother also filed through an accountant, but told me the accountant probably did not file me as a dependent. If she did, I probably would not qualify to receive a check. But I got my tax return, so it's impossible for her to have filed me as a dependent.

I keep checking the status on the IRS site and it is way past the date where many others have gotten their deposit, so I am wondering if filing from a third party affects the time I get the money? Or are some deposits simply delayed?"

All I've run into are awful people, and I have difficult believing that good people outnumber them. Kind and respectful is not the same as being a good person.

I hope I find those better people."

Good people are difficult to come by. I hope your life keeps going well. You deserve it."
AskReddit,ezv6veb,t3_d2c1h8,1568168748.0,"My ex just broke up with me a couple days ago, revealing himself to be a complete sociopath and awful human being. He was so charming, most of the time we had been together. I still love him and it makes me feel pathetic saying I'd take him back if he asked me.

With this revelation, I've come to the conclusion that good people simply don't exist. Or if they do, it's never in my immediate vicinity. I don't meet them, everyone around me is similar to him and it makes me absolutely sick to my stomach. I tried to make myself feel better by holding myself on a moral pedestal and told myself and better than everyone else around me, morally. But then I felt awful. Both because I was being egotistical, which is against my own moral code, and because if I was right, then what's the point? I don't want to live in a world where people are like this. My feelings are much more complicated than this, though. My head is so crowded.

So I tried committing suicide today. And this girl and her boyfriend stopped me. It's the second time I've been stopped. Seeing a good person gave me some hope, but I don't want to be here any more than I did 24 hours ago. Why won't life let me die? Just let me end it. Stop sending out people to tell me no, because if they tell me no, I won't do it. Stop sending people my way. Let me be alone, I don't want them."

I'm stuck here now."
