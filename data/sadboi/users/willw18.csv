It sounds like you're going through an incredibly tough time, and it sounds like you've already tried different options like therapy already

I wish I could, but I can't offer any quick fix for this sort of thing. What I can say is that, as you probably already know. The fluctuating hormones don't help with feelings of depression. Taking care of yourself physically, although difficult, does help your mental health. Where abouts are you based? I'm always happy to chat and talk things through."
