I’m very thankful and I wish other people were able to also get the relieve that they need because for the breakthrough praying that I deal with, the ibuprofen and Tylenol really don’t come close to touching it the way oxycodone does and maybe it’s just me but I don’t get high off of it at all it just relieves the pain and works solidly. I think having a partial tolerance might have something to do with it but I hope that cleared it up. By the way, if you’re having any issues I hope that you find some relief yourself.

I will say that I’ve been a fan probably since around 98 casually and have steadily growing more and more a fan since then but that error probably between 1995 and 2005 was probably the greatest 10 years of NASCAR history and I hope we can get back to that. I know this response is slightly off-topic but it relates to whole core thread that I’m sure you also will agree with like when 60 cars used to cone to Daytona/ Talladega to qualify for 43 spots and now it’s just 40 in the NASCAR Cup Series, missing the eras of the late Winston Cup/ early Nextel Cup years."

And I’ve spoken with a few other people about this but I think that should be at least a multi month type of thing and then maybe eventually have universal basic income to help the rest of us and maybe you can allocate that money to go towards specific essential functions in your life so it’s not just like free-floating cash that you can use on anything, but do you have thoughts on that?"

Also, I believe that if you’re going to freely provide methadone, naloxone and buprenorphine to anybody who needs that shit to varying degrees, then you are to reform the laws when it comes to people that are on it for chronic pain and long-term cases. They’re not the ones who are abusing it and miss using it in ways that are detrimental to their health.

I ask that because soma is a very strong medication and it seems to work synergistically if you take it with certain opiates, nerve medications, and anti-Zaidi drugs. As my friend who is on 20+ medications because of her life of many medical problems once told me, no matter how much you’re on and how you balance it out, eventually each person with coronation from their doctors will eventually find the combination that works most effectively to minimize their pain and other negative feelings and stuff that they are going through relevant to the circumstances.

opiates,fn29vr8,t1_fn29sc8,1586582019.0,"It’s a beautiful thing, even if it’s only for a couple hours. Trust me, between my anxiety disorder, chronic knee pain, IBS, various severe insomnia’s, it’s a feeling that is few and far between for myself but having moments of that really make you appreciate being healthy. Just out of curiosity how are you doing with daily life and with your process handling pain and other things, etc. if you don’t mind me asking!"
Coronavirus,fn29s7r,t1_fn28e6t,1586581934.0,"Id so based around the best scientists in the world and draw conclusions from most concrete, but evolving data that’s adapting to the progression of it all. It’s quite interesting and I know where you’re going, but we have different opinions. I would venture a guess that you’d handle everything outside of the box, which I’d be curious about in that hypothetical situation. what I’d assume you would do is fully backed up by credible facts, and guidance from relevant experts in their fields pertaining to this specific topic/ related ones to this. Honestly, I’d love to hear you’d handle things versus how I would."
Connecticut,fn283nh,t1_fn27e8h,1586580507.0,"I work in retail at a grocery store so every little bit helps because I have been on a leave of absence due to focusing on my mental health conditions, physical knee pain. It’s not much but it helps but if we adopted so many things from other countries like universal basic income, universal healthcare, repealing those 1% tax cut, doing more to help the less fortunate, the veterans, and anyone who needs it especially during grade times of questions and uncertainty with this global pandemic. I know Spain has struggled with so much but they’re doing their best to show their resiliency and I would love to see more of that here in America, in addition to our governor doing everything he can possibly do within the guidance from the CDC/ federal government/ many other meaningful but helpfully vital functions necessary across the board here and across the country!"
Connecticut,fn27srl,t1_fn27bps,1586580258.0,"They are and I can kind of understand where you’re coming from and for the most part if not all, fully agree with what you’re saying. It’s very logical and structured in a way that makes so much sense in this whole us versus them mentality is just angry members of the GOP who will bitch against every single democratic proposal, Bill, reform, even positively helpful suggestion for our state but of course they are in the minority party which doesn’t have much credibility her given that their governor candidate was Stefanowski and not the amazing mayor Mark Bolton from Danbury who even though he’s a Republican, I agree with him on so many issues and he and Aaron Stewart would’ve made great gov/ VP! I have full trust in our state and local government including the leader of everybody, Ned Lamont, to keep working hard to get things better in our state, get the stimulus checks out, help those who need it, and get Connecticut back to where we can be and hopefully this experience for Mike and allow small businesses in the self-employed to get the desperate relief and lowered taxes they need to function and turn a profit in a state that desperately needs them! I hope I was able to converse about the main topic w/ what you were saying while backing things up with creative/ rational thinking, among truths/ all of our own/ more often than not, valid w/ my personal opinions too!"
Coronavirus,fn27clf,t3_fyrwbc,1586579891.0,"And of course the green orange mistake asshole is going to try to do this role back sooner than he should against the advice and suggestions of relevant credentialed medical professionals who know more than he ever well. We’re all scared that even with social distancing were seeing dangerous and dramatic results so God for bid we did not have this, I’m almost having a panic attack wondering what may have been! We’re still not even at the peak, but we have to keep our heads down/ focused on keeping doing what we’ve been and whatever more is necessary for us to keep on doing!"
opiates,fn270ok,t1_fn26ddv,1586579624.0,"I’ve probably taken more than them tonight but obviously I am totally fine because of tolerances and spaced out doses. I understand the worries of combining the two especially lately, but the therapeutic combination really does help your mind and multifaceted ways. I think it’s just about knowing how to stay within your daily dosage/ doctor recommended suggestions. We all wanna get better, but some obviously want to enjoy things to the HIGHER end of the wide spectrum!"
Connecticut,fn26tw3,t1_fn24xf3,1586579469.0,"Me either, even though they have all my information related to my tax return/direct deposit numbers that have been the same forever. I’m hoping it’s because the big comprehensive list is working its way to me and other people soon! In CT, I’ve learned to not trust a damn thing until you have your money/ among other things!"
Connecticut,fn26odf,t1_fn24koe,1586579340.0,"Actually, I was thinking about going that direction because everyone bitches about everything here (I chose not to. I got my own shit to worry about) but no one seems to leave. I’m not sure if I would leave but it would be more of a decision based on a variety of issues. I believe the complaining that the people who love to just bullshit about everything will chime in whenever they’d love to speak their unwanted opinions that no one wants. We know what’s up, just don’t need the constant reminders!"
Connecticut,fn26dzq,t1_fn24dcn,1586579103.0,"I’m glad it’s going to be distributed very soon. I unfortunately for the moment for the next year or so or probably on the lower end of the spectrum but I’m sure others will get the shit before me. I know it’s pretty much a work in progress but I just want everyone to get the money and in the future, it would be nice if they had universal basic income which would help all of us during times of good and bad economic and financial stability/instability."
opiates,fn26air,t1_fn23mry,1586579029.0,I honestly think it should be done on a person by person basis. I know how that is living in Connecticut where everything is controlled but I’ve been on both for a while. They really both benefit me and the how much they help outweigh the risks also having a tolerance helps. Are you on pain management and how does it handle everything where are you are for what deal with.
opiates,fn263hz,t1_fn23lk8,1586578872.0,And that is...?
opiates,fn2620e,t1_fn23h0n,1586578841.0,That sounds pretty awesome so enjoy and I’m sure I’ll get mine at some point fairly soon. Keep calm and carry-on high!  💊🍾
opiates,fn216xz,t3_fytyrd,1586575160.0,I'm still waiting for mine in Connecticut but they will find a way to fuck me here w/ how they do shit! ENJOY! what 40 caps are you popping (obviously not once)?
NASCAR,fn1l1ww,t3_fygxwp,1586564287.0,I have a serious question related to this: will there be provisional spots available for people in the back or is that not a thing anymore.
AskReddit,fn1komq,t3_fyhpcc,1586564060.0,An anxiety-filled life that affects one’s ability to function which ends up being exacerbated by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
opiates,fmyanv4,t3_fxztjr,1586481788.0,"Opiates I find are quite therapeutic and so beneficial for pain/ anxiety concurrently now during times of being in a house for prolonged periods of times, especially when you also have a dr. doing telemedicine appointments as well! The only big drawback is the fact that Schedule 2 controls are one of the few prescriptions that CVS can’t deliver so I have to go there in person, praying I don’t get sick from COVID-19."
NASCAR,fmvelie,t3_fxfid6,1586414318.0,"This makes me curious about this most popular driver icon from 2002-2017 who shined in his own spotlight beyond #3’s black goodwrench shadow, sometime in the near future: Dale Earnhardt Junior. Considering his many wins in  2 cup series, including the 1998 and 1999 Busch/ Xfinity Series seasons, 2 Daytona 500 wins, his stellar 2004/ 2014 years."
Anxiety,fmsiv8s,t1_fmsij8v,1586356351.0,I used to take both of those and I found that they worked well. I totally get the aspect of trying to hold onto a job and try to function in life despite this horrible mental illness. I am contemplating taking a formal leave absence from what I do so I can hopefully take as much time as I need to get better again after things really have gotten bad. I have no idea how I’m supposed to work now w/ all the crazy BS hitting the fan especially living within 2 hours of NYC w/ the virus spreading rapidly right as this severe anxiety hits hard!
Coronavirus,fmsi08v,t1_fms77j8,1586355862.0,"I actually still do that with my friends and even family too, Especially now. I should mention that I am from Connecticut so it definitely fits into what we do up here."
Anxiety,fmshu6l,t1_fmshieq,1586355767.0,"I want to say that I’m glad that you’re doing better and I have followed the same path except for recently. The thing is I have been seeing a therapist and also a psychiatrist for about five years now. It was never this bad until recently with the convergence of the pandemic, extreme stress at work, and a mental break down happening all simultaneously. I am prescribed hydroxyzine and clonazepam for anxiety and they help control it but b lately, when life hots you at once in the face w/ a ugh, it can be so troublesome/ debilitating."
Eminem,fmcp08f,t3_fu9njc,1585949945.0,I would listen to “almost famous.”
todayilearned,fm47kus,t3_fsw207,1585748397.0,I feel like that’s how the zombie apocalypse is going to start/ how the coronavirus got started in Wuhan.
NASCAR,fm47bv8,t3_fsq5q5,1585748235.0,There is nothing more gratifying than avoiding the big one at Talledega or Daytona. I don’t care if someone’s playing iRacing or NASCAR heat 4/ the real life races. It’s a matter of luck and skill.
opiates,flzfkoa,t3_frzlqf,1585622488.0,"Whenever I’m having pain, anxiety, or going to bed, I normally take a 5 mg oxycodone, 1 or 2 mg of clonazepam, and 25 to 50 mg of hydroxyzine, and I find that I am fine but because of being on them for so long and the tolerance due to the chronic nature of the pain and anxiety. Moderation goes a long way and everyone handles shot differently!"
ibs,flzfdfa,t1_flzfand,1585622357.0,"Oh I know. People are like vultures especially right now hoarding everything, with no regard to people like us who literally have to deal with so much shit. For us it’s stocking up a normal amount, for them it’s acting like apocalyptic zombie times."
opiates,flzf9sj,t1_flyw0xh,1585622292.0,I think what he’s referring to is Tylenol #3 with codeine.
ibs,flzf255,t1_flzet6g,1585622149.0,"I feel your pain. I have two emergency roles in my room, they are the crème de la crème aka Scott 1,000 sheet ones if the 350 double rolls downstairs get used up. I’m searching everywhere tomorrow to try and stock up on toilet paper hand sanitizer and Kleenex. I hope that you have enough and anyone who needs some, I hope is able to get that."
Connecticut,flzbi2j,t3_frx804,1585619803.0,"I understand in limited situations this could be considered constitutional but for the most part I’m pretty sure that a lot of the circumstances surrounding this are unconstitutional and should be challenged in court. I mean shit, am I going to have to take the Coronavirus test results of negative from two weeks ago and get them laminated and walk around everywhere like I’m holding the star of David for fucks sake. Shit is getting way out of hand. I’m all for containment of the illness but I also want my constitutional rights respected."
NASCAR,flzbact,t1_flz3f1k,1585619662.0,"I agree. If he handled this when it first started like a competent person would, everything could be well under control and we would be able to get back to our normal lives along with racing much sooner. I mean shit now we’re going to miss the Bristol race next week but I find that iRacing is helping fill the void during this difficult time."
ibs,flzayyd,t3_frqul4,1585619457.0,"Oh my god yes. Usually, it’s either the pop a vein in your forehead kind or the waterfall of brown. I would give anything to even be remotely normal at this point"
ibs,flzaf1r,t1_flxt0lx,1585619102.0,"You and me both. Even my family is like, “Ryan conserve the toilet paper.“ My response to them is, “I can’t stop shitting because of my condition so tell all the hoarders that it’s really affecting me. I’m not doing a damn thing different especially when it comes to my bathroom habits.“ It has been about four days since weave been able to find some but have about 10 left. Tomorrow, we venture out on a journey of epic proportions to find some, any at this point!"
ibs,flza81i,t3_frubxs,1585618977.0,"So true! Although, if I end up having a fever, that will be the red flag because I only have the normal IBS flare ups but never with an upper respiratory infection, just straight up piercing pain in my abdomen which again is normal lol!"
