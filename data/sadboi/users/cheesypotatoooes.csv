CsectionCentral,ffk0ac8,t1_ffiphsd,1580011896.0,"> For me, even though I went through a rough labor with my second just to end up in another c section, I would have been disappointed if I didn't try. And now I know going forward that all my babies will be c sections.

This is exactly how I feel! I also had a ~70% chance of success with VBAC. I wanted so bad for it to be successful and cried when they recommended a repeat section after I regressed from 10 cm to 8. Then when they opened me up, they found my baby’s shoulder sticking out! It turned out I had ruptured and the only thing keeping him in was the umbilical cord being wrapped around his leg. So it’s c sections only from now on and honestly part of me is relieved, especially after reading through this sub. There are a lot of encouraging comments about scheduled sections and it eases my fears."

I don’t think they liked the publicity and being called out for being a cult. Before that, they were causing a lot of trouble not only in Wells, but in surrounding areas (such as my hometown). It was really worrying. I wish the church would die out but it appears to be going strong seeing as they have ~200 members according to google."
FundieSnark,fe0dxaf,t1_fdzsr6n,1578811314.0,It seems like they have to have permission to talk to the men and they’re not supposed to speak to outsiders. I seriously worry for every woman and child stuck in that cult. They truly are trapped and will be lucky to get out.
FundieSnark,fdxie7s,t3_enba2b,1578768984.0,Yup! I live near Wells and have driven through there maaannyyy times. It is most definitely a cult. The women aren’t allowed to talk and they have to walk behind their husbands because they’re seen as lesser than. They have similar beliefs to iblp/quiverfull and I don’t think they seek medical/prenatal care. There’s been reports of people screaming late at night on “church property” (the church owns a lot of land that members live on) and they won’t interact with anyone outside the church for the most part. Dr Phil did a two part episode about it! It was the talk of the town for a little while.

DuggarsSnark,fca4i4w,t3_egtim7,1577562942.0,"My theory is that Jill had a uterine rupture with Sam. It’s probably me slightly projecting since I had one with my VBAC, but it just makes sense to me. The picture of her holding Sam (where she looked like she had lost a lot of blood) is what made me feel like something was off. Like it was more than just a failed VBAC that resulted in a repeat c-section. I was told to wait a minimum of two years before getting pregnant again but that it would be better if I waited 4 years. It’s possible Jill was told the same and that’s why they haven’t had another baby yet. It’s also possible that she had a rupture that resulted in a hysterectomy but I don’t think she did. If she had a rupture, I think they’re either done having kids or waiting a safe amount of time to lower the chances of a rupture during pregnancy."
