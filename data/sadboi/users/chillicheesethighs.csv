Being ‚Äúprolife‚Äù is seriously one of the most thoughtless political platforms to be a part of. Like how much thought goes into a stance where you believe, ‚Äúsperm meet egg, now new human form‚Äù. They refuse to actually look into any of the science. They‚Äôd rather see a person be born into an abusive family, or passed around in the foster system, rather than let a woman get an abortion on a ‚Äúliving being‚Äù that has no consciousness. They don‚Äôt care that that there are literally millions of homeless, starving, and abused children. They don‚Äôt care about those lives.

The people who WEREN‚ÄôT any of those things, however, were the 4 old ass wastes of oxygen protesting abortions right outside, making my sister feel terrified for getting a service she needed at the time.
 
What I have come to find is that when people say they‚Äôre ‚Äúprolife‚Äù what they mean is, they‚Äôre only prolife for things that haven‚Äôt even been born yet. They don‚Äôt care that these ‚Äúhumans‚Äù have not fully formed, that they don‚Äôt have consciousness, that they aren‚Äôt even BORN. For most part, prolifers are concerned only with unseen life.
