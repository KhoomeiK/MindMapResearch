The only borough you see on this map is Manhattan.

EDIT: also, geographically speaking, Manhattan is an island which is why you don’t see the other boroughs bordering it. Brooklyn and Queens are geographically part of Long Island (both boroughs are to the east of Manhattan). The Bronx is geographically part of the “mainland” US, so it’s connected to upstate New York, and then Staten Island is south of Manhattan, closer to New Jersey, and connected via bridge to south Brooklyn."

They don’t come here to actually have thoughtful conversations, they come here for the hive mind and to just agree with one another that any woman who gets an abortion is automatically a murderer. 

Being “prolife” is seriously one of the most thoughtless political platforms to be a part of. Like how much thought goes into a stance where you believe, “sperm meet egg, now new human form”. They refuse to actually look into any of the science. They’d rather see a person be born into an abusive family, or passed around in the foster system, rather than let a woman get an abortion on a “living being” that has no consciousness. They don’t care that that there are literally millions of homeless, starving, and abused children. They don’t care about those lives. They only care about the ones that don’t exist yet, and how these lives can also potentially end up living absolutely difficult lives. Being prolife is inherently selfish.

The people who WEREN’T any of those things, however, were the 4 old ass wastes of oxygen protesting abortions right outside, making my sister feel terrified for getting a service she needed at the time.
 
What I have come to find is that when people say they’re “prolife” what they mean is, they’re only prolife for things that haven’t even been born yet. They don’t care that these “humans” have not fully formed, that they don’t have consciousness, that they aren’t even BORN. For most part, prolifers are concerned only with unseen life. But when it comes to people already living who are in dire need of help? Can’t find them anywhere."
