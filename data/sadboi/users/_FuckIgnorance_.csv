BPD,fom167u,t3_g81zto,1587875520.0,I used to add lies to a conversation to make it more interesting so I wouldn’t feel left out or be awkward. It made me feel good but now it’s meh since I don’t have friends anymore.
BPD,fkmoqm6,t3_fj1v3p,1584334811.0,Abandonment and trauma is apart of the development of BPD. Personally I try to hold in my ways of thinking when I feel like I'm being abandoned when I'm not. My mom left my family when I was 12 so there's a lot of trauma for me with all the fighting and drugs in the house. I was molested by my brother at 3 years old so that's horrible to go through especially my family taking my brothers side on this. He was 13 and knew what he was doing. I lived in fear till I was 19 living with his alcoholism. We think we're being abandon but we're not. We just have to find healthy coping skills so no drugs or alcohol. Not doing this alone because we need the help. I hope you feel better and know you're not alone. I recommend CBT or DBT skills.
BPD,fkfjdhr,t3_fi06qa,1584135702.0,"I became addicted to weed after smoking it straight for two and half years. I smoked almost 7 times a day and took three 600mg edibles a day. Yes it’s addicting so no negative comments saying it isn’t. It came to a point where I was asking my dad, sister and anyone else for money lying to them for what it was for. I was very suicidal and never left the house only to the dispensary for more trying to forget these intrusive thoughts and go about my day. I eventually went to my third psychiatric hospital and stayed for a week after coming to terms that my plan wouldn’t work. I’m still depressed and now sober from weed, 60 days. Would’ve been more sober days but relapsed. I used to experiment with other drugs too and now I’m addicted to nicotine to sub the weed so I traded an addiction for another. Please don’t smoke so much and get help like therapy. I don’t know if you already are going but be as honest as you can and go with the program because weed isn’t the answer. I understand if you use it to go to sleep or if you get anxious, any medical issues. Weed is so good for anything but not mental illness especially if your taking medication with it."

BPD,fj14hj8,t1_fj00bwr,1582912852.0,I mean I think we’re all no stranger to bad coping skills but I understand what you mean. I wasn’t trying to make the person feel bad or anything.
BPD,fiznvcj,t3_faibl9,1582868237.0,CBT skills helped me so much for a few weeks of therapy. You’ll benefit from DBT if you try your best to bring these skills outside of therapy. Good luck and I wish you happiness.
BPD,fiyq02q,t3_faht3z,1582844379.0,"I relate with you a lot and I have two friends which usually isn’t enough for me but I’ve always been a loner. I hate labels but I guess thats what I am because I’ve always felt comfortable being alone. I’ve gotten too comfortable with it to the point I dissociate while I’m with my friends. I’ll be 20 soon and don’t work or go to school due to mental health issues (borderline, depression, anxiety and ptsd) which usually doesn’t help but healthy distractions help me. Trying to think or look at things differently helps, thinking outside of the box. Self help books, I can recommend you a few if you’d like. There’s a difference between feeling alone and actually being alone. It’s hard to feel and be both you know but understand that there’s people around you who love you even though it doesn’t feel like it."
BPD,fiypmua,t1_fiycxeb,1582844155.0,Self harm isn’t good advice at all. Are you trying to encourage someone recovering from self harm to do it?
BPD,fi80kot,t3_f6jck1,1582231200.0,Don’t feel like this is a small step to recovery because this is a big step. You should be proud of yourself and I am proud of you even though we don’t know each other. The same thing happened to me while I was in outpatient therapy while in cbt therapy. The people around me (family) were the ones who weren’t helping and acting like the uncivil one. There’s a lot of arguing in my house when everyone is irritated and when I’m irritated I snap throughout the day in cycles. But our recovery take a situation into a calm manner and be better for ourselves. It’s a hard mental challenge but keep up the dbt skills and you’ll start to feel way better. I promise you that.
family,fbw9qia,t1_faf7fk8,1577144268.0,Have you ever been sexually abused in anyway? Would you like to be questioned like this? It’s called PTSD and being afraid of your abuser but I can’t speak for every victim out there. Everyone experiences stuff differently.
family,fbw9e59,t3_e8ncx6,1577144012.0,"I’m sorry your family doesn’t support you but I do. I’m a victim of molestation from my brother who sexually abused me and my sister. I was 4yrs old and my parents gave my 13yr old brother help at the time and they hoped I would forget about it. 16 years later after those multiple incidents, I have major ptsd and trust issues. I’ve been in three psychiatric hospitals and diagnosed with multiple things. Anyways my addict brother just moved out at the age of 26 after all those years of emotional abuse. Recently I went to my third psychiatric hospital for wanting to attempt suicide. I’m a very sensitive person given that I have borderline personality disorder which is usually developed by trauma at a young age. My family supports my brother and keeps inviting him to family events like Thanksgiving and now Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Eve is in a day and I’m so torn. I’m spending my Christmas Eve alone. I know plenty of people do but this will be the first one for me. I saw him on Thanksgiving, I was fine because I was drinking but a few days later I looked at our front door camera and my sister said not to look but I did out of curiosity. My brother left the house before dinner without telling anyone because he told my dad I didn’t want him there. Hmm I wonder why. My dad talked to my brother at the front door, my names Kat by the way but my dad said “Kat is just keeping these bullshit memories inside their head and is keeping this as an excuse to lay around all day and be lazy.” Those words hurt me and I reacted by laughing my ass off to a full blown mental breakdown. After my mom left when I was 12, I thought since one parent stayed, I should love and trust him with my life. I vented to him for years and he had me fooled. All these years I’ve noticed his manipulative side. I know a manipulative person when I see one because my mom did it to me, she was a drug addict and lied to everyone. I’m an ex drug addict due to our horrible genes but I’m 93 days sober. This year has been the most hardest shit ever and I don’t even know how I’m still here. I’m too poor to move out and if I did, I’d be homeless living in my car. I have to stick with this bullshit and put a fake smile on. My safe place is going to my best friends house, who told me he’s moving next year. I don’t know where I’m going to go but stay strong man, you’ve created a family of your own and your family needs to understand that not everyone experiences hardships the same way. I’m very sorry for what happened to you so from a victim to another, you can do this. Don’t let others get to you, only you know yourself, nobody else."
