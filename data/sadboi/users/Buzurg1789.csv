Like the way Arkham City's villain encounters are constructed like a ladder, where motivations get more complex as we go along. You know, we go from Two-Face and Penguin, both have petty goals - money and collecting shit respectively. Then we get to Ra's, Freeze and Strange, who pursue goals that seem more selfless, though there are certainly selfish elements within them. Finally we get to Joker who's goal is same as Batman's, the difference being their different beliefs - survive and continue proving a point. 

He loves exploring the similarities and differences between Batman and his villains. There's just something fascinating about the way he explores Batman's ideals through setting, atmosphere and manages to integrate so much personality into every aspect of story. Something like Wonder City could have just been a cool mindless setting, but it is in the game to showcase how delusional Ra's is, that despite his seemingly understandable goals, he literally lives in the city ruined by his ideology, yet still mindlessly continues his quest."

""Oh, that dude we saw in the court, that's the guy who killed his family. I mean, we have nobody else lol"". That was neither satisfying nor fulfilling. 

I wouldn't say that season 1 nullified his arc. He barely had an arc in DD season 2. It's funny that people talk about Frank being different in his own show, when he isn't (well, he is different in season 2 of his show, but that's a different topic). Rewatch DD season 2, we only see him in bits and pieces, it's more of a character exploration than arc. 

The only development (if we can call it that) he got was him being more comfortable with killing, while in the early episodes he did show some doubts and concerns (like that kid screaming in the crowd). Season 1 didn't change that, in fact, in it, Frank shows zero doubts about killing his enemies. Hell, he gets angry when he doesn't (Bennett). 

Plus, the show focused on lots of themes that Ennis explored. That's why Frank burns his skull, the point was to showcase how unable he is to live a normal life, how he needs to fight to stay the course. There's an implication that Frank may have loved fighting more than his family, that's why he keeps seeing his wife getting shot by him. He feels guilty because he spent so much time fighting to the point where his war caused his family's death. Lewis and Billy were in many ways mirrors to Frank himself, all broken by their pasts and all doing what they think is justified. 

DD season 2 didn't even come close to level of depth that writers injected into Frank in his first season. We saw him from perspective of others in it. In his show, they delved into his psyche, to showcase how broken he is.

Though your points are totally valid, we should've gotten something with Selina. I love the idea of Alfred making Bruce choose, it's the moment where we finally decide whether Batman is Bruce's true self and Bruce is a mask or it's the opposite. I just hate that they decided to go with the whole Batman makes things worse angle. 

Plus, I hate that we can't properly argue Alfred, tell him that his points are bullshit. It also makes Alfred looks like a complete ass. 

I heard a theory that Alfred made up the whole argument to convince Bruce to leave. That he knows that Batman is doing good, he just can't just sit and watch how his son dies. So he crafted this bs to make himself feel better about leaving. If that's the case, then I would like the ending more.

Flying Dutchman is like one of the most important factors in the Pirates universe, it is a way to lead the dead to the other world. Will was a perfect candidate, so while he won't be able to live a normal life, his sacrifice will keep the balance. This mumbo jumbo that randomly fixes that just takes away that consequence and lessens the impact of it all.

Jack takes back a pearl, sure, but what the fuck did he do to earn it? Jack shit is what he did. In every previous movie, Jack earned his victories and his respect, this was just pathetic in comparison. Everyone did the work for him while he just stood there like a buffoon. That's just not Jack.

The only thing I agree with is Barbosa. While I hate the fact that he and Jack didn't get many scenes together and had meaningful dialogues, his death was well done. Seeing such an ambigous character do something selfless was great way to end his story.

It doesn't help that in the comics, those who don't agree to work under government, get locked up in a fucking Negative Zone, you know, place that turns people crazy over time. While in the movie, they just need to retire if they disagree.

Bruce's arc can be all about him relearning to trust others and realizing that he needs his folk. Maybe loneliness messed him up a lot, so Batfamily would help him to deal with it.

I especially love how you noticed a pattern with a money. Thematically, it seems to be a critique of civilization and industrialization in a way.

Dutch preaches about living free, away from society and civilized world, yet he doesn't seem to live by his words. He's always wearing expensive clothes, uses expensive guns, lies, deceives, uses fancy words, just to get what he wants. Not only that, but he is obsessed with money, which like greatest tool of civilized world. He is basically what he hates the most. 

Arthur, at least in the good path, is exact opposite in that regard. He is very self-aware, rugged, gets his hands dirty, honest and genuine in his words, almost always says what he means. All he wants is to give his people an opportunity to live away from civilized world. He is clearly against most of Dutch's cash-obsessed plans, as he believes that it will draw attention to them. Basically, he is exactly what Dutch thinks he himself is. 

This critique of industrialization isn't just presented through characters and the money connection you noticed, but also through gameplay. When you're in early sections of a game, away from modern society, environment is vast and beautiful. When you're in Saint Dennis, it's the opposite, environment is very claustrophobic, the air is polluted, everything seems restrictive. This game is truly a masterpiece."

I love secondary characters, don't get me wrong, but in this specific movie, I was more emotionally connected to OGs with War Machine, Ant-man, Nebula and Rocket, so I wanted more from them. They were main characters, it's the last time we saw all of them together, so I would prefer them getting all the satisfying moments, because newcomers will get theirs in the future, but now it's not an option."
marvelstudios,f8tezo7,t1_f8tdrn9,1574801987.0,"I wouldn't say boring, but definitely too short, or at least not focused on right characters. I think I would've preferred it lot more if it focused most on main characters we were watching throughout the movie, especially OGs. Instead it kind of started showing secondary or even cameo characters doing cool stuff, while OGs were pushed to the background, which I didn't like at all. 

Still though, it was really fun while it lasted, in my opinion at least."
Watchmen,f8t36j2,t1_f8t12m3,1574794798.0,"I mean, Matthew Goode, unlike JDM, didn't have much to work with in the movie, so it was an easy replacement in my opinion."

TheBlackList,f8q0u3q,t3_e1kj4h,1574710350.0,"To be honest, I personally don't like any of them. Both NCIS and Criminal Minds started very well and were actually pretty good for multiple seasons, but they just turned into rehashing same shit over and over again."
thewalkingdead,f8q0k53,t1_f8porji,1574710230.0,TWD is a type of show that is so much more enjoyable and emotional when you're binging it.
DC_Cinematic,f8q08bw,t1_f8pl87d,1574710080.0,"The biggest problem I have is that Batman, the world's greatest detective, gets fooled so easily throughout the movie and doesn't find out Clark's true identity."
mentalillness,f8ohyd3,t3_e12wob,1574681904.0,"Everyone around me is that person - my sister, my mother, my uncle, neighbors, friends, etc. I have depersonalization disorder with addition of auditory hallucinations, so every time I get episodes, they act like I can control it easily and call me creepy and weird. I learned to accept it, because there's no way I'll find anyone who understands me in the shithole I live in."

BatmanArkham,f8jsrpv,t1_f8gye1k,1574603944.0,"Roger Craig Smith. He also voiced Ezio Auditore in Assassin's Creed games, Chris Redfield in Resident Evil 5 and 6, Sonic, Captain America, etc. Guy is one of the best voice actors in the industry."
BatmanArkham,f8cfkp6,t3_e04fvj,1574459185.0,"While I agree with most of your points, that's the thing though, this is Batman, not Spider-Man or any other hero. He operates strictly during night-time, he only goes out on daylight if it's absolutely necessary, so I don't think night and day thing would work without taking away Batman's core. 

Populated Gotham is also something that would work on more linear games, but in open-world Batman game it would feel pretty out of place for Bats to fight in the middle of tonnes of people. Once again, if it's Spider-Man, then sure, but Batman doesn't operate that way, so once again, a huge conundrum."
BatmanArkham,f8cet1p,t3_e06bdf,1574458727.0,"That was the moment when Alfred realizes that Bruce is long gone, Batman is Bruce's true self now."

BatmanArkham,f8aqs0x,t1_f8amzpn,1574407278.0,"Honestly, crime investigations in Arkham Knight made me feel like Iron Man rather than Batman. They are so overly technological."
BatmanArkham,f82lz0j,t3_dybzxk,1574193806.0,"Actually, reconstruction works very similarly to Telltale games. Tech isn't doing all the work, Batman is just using tech to visualize his thinking. 

For example, in Lacey Towers murder investigation, Batman thinks that Penguin fired the shot, because it was at a low angle, so his reconstruction shows Penguin. Then, after examining the evidence, he deduces that shot was fired from someone lying on the ground, so reconstruction shows someone lying on the ground.

Basically, Batman is adding those parameters into his computer after deducing what happened, it didn't magically reconstruct the scene itself. So Batman is still doing all the thinking and investigating, tech is only visualizing it."
