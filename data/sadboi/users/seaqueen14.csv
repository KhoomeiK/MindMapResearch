Itâ€™ll take a lot of time, but it has to happen one way or another. As someone whoâ€™s also had issues w their dad, I totally get never wanting to have anything to do with him again. This might be difficult to hear, but one day you might need him. Hopefully you never will, but in this life, you really never know. You can be angry and push him away all you want, I would just advise against making any permanent decisions, because you you never know. Approaching this strategically while your emotions heal  might work out in your favor someday. Best of luck"

Prior to this I was and am still convinced that theyâ€™d rather I not be there in the first place, like Iâ€™m a burden on them to begin with. Theyâ€™re better off not knowing me, and then Iâ€™m left all alone. Iâ€™m told that maybe they feel that way because I feel that they feel that way, but now that the damage is done what is there left to do? It doesnâ€™t even matter anymore"
