EstrangedAdultChild,fqpmvk8,t3_gk8aw2,1589550007.0,"Initiating contact with your Enabler Mother sounds as dangerous as initiating contact with your N father. Please consider another therapist who will not suggest having contact and going against what (for me) was a painful, life changing, permanent decision to make. 

Also, generally, here,in my experience,  contacting Ns and Es is not advised, and anyone who encourages you to do so is not on your side or does not fully understand your/our situation. Like quitting drinking, moderation is not advised.

And, after all this, you do take the risk to contact, absolutely do not give your mom/parents any information. Look up “grey-rock”ing. 

Good luck to you! You are strong to ask for advice! This is a rocky road, but it is sounding like yours is smoothing out!"

Once he knew it bothered you/women and he did not stop/apologize, there is no way to know how far he will take his disrespect for you. He is closer to shooting than not. Safety is compromised.

Him making a joke about an actual massacre like this is akin to joking to Jewish people “To the right.

LifeAfterNarcissism,fdlnvzu,t3_elal4j,1578528299.0,"I understand the rage. Several years NC, and don’t regret it for a moment. When I realized I was drinking my anger, I knew I had to stop drinking. What has helped me: self-compassion (try guided self-compassion meditations), therapy, exercise, regular sleep, time. I am also dabbling in meditation, because I need practice the calm I want to feel all the time. I am not calm all the time, but I can practice and work towards calmness. Good for you for leaving all that behind!"

Each group is specific to your location, and is based on simply offering to your community what you don’t need, and asking for what you do need. Not only have I given away so much, and received so many lovely and useful things, but it encourages you to meet your neighbors, as well as fosters a feeling of abundance. I still thrift/alley shop with some compulsion, but it has lessened so much now I have gotten to the point where I have most of what I need for now, and can just say “no” when I see something beautiful and free!"
AskReddit,fd0mgeh,t1_fd0j0n2,1578120872.0,"I am so glad you got out! I understand having to go through overhauling your belief system/religion/spirituality, as I had to do the same. I love this quote from Jamie Lee Finch: “I lost god to gain myself. I’ll lose you to keep her if I have to.” Also found her book really helpful: *You Are Your Own: A Reckoning With the Religious Trauma of Evangelical Christianity.* All the luck on your new path!"

So glad you have support! I too am finally learning what real conscious reliable unconditional love looks like."
EstrangedAdultChild,fcyw57u,t1_fcxqzr8,1578088388.0,"You know, I had a “last straw” moment too, that eye-opening moment when you know the N will never change. The last hurtful thing my N said/did was painful, not because of its rarity, but because of its frequency. My similar attempts to help my N counted for nothing, and when the last incident happened, the straw broke even as the words came out of their mouth. It suddenly became clear that nothing I ever said or did would help the situation, and it was then the seeds for (a successful) NC were planted. For all the pain, the clarity is transformative."

One I have noticed, not visual but sound: beginning one episode, the announcer over the pa is obviously reading while speaking into the mic, and poorly times his words. I forget the exact quote, but he asks a rhetorical question like “Whose idea was this anyway?” but it sounds like: “Whose idea was this. Anyway?”"
EstrangedAdultChild,fcxqp5b,t3_ejgmdk,1578069163.0,"You do not have to be around anyone who speaks abusively like that and does not recognize your true worth. Good for you for saying “no!” It may be challenging at the beginning, but so worth it.
Now you can begin to heal. So excited for your new life!"
LifeAfterNarcissism,fcwq75d,t3_ej16vn,1578033348.0,This sounds challenging! It is so hard to feel like you need to protect yourself in your own home. What would help you most? How is your guest troubling you? Do they need at be at your house 24/7?
