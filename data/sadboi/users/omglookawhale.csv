The most basic answer is to challenge those thoughts. What evidence do you have that a thought it real; what evidence do you have that it isn't? What are some other possibilities? Do other people share this paranoid thought?

A typical example would be seeing friends laughing and thinking that they're laughing at you and are all secretly in this scheme against you:

What evidence do you have this is real? You can see them laughing

What evidence do you have that your assumption isn't real? They've never behaved in any sort of way that would clue you in that they dislike you

What are some other possible things that could be going on? Someone told a funny story, someone made a joke, they're having a good time together, etc.

AskReddit,fe95dw4,t3_eo4rf0,1578934382.0,I'm on anti-depressants so I could go a pretty long time.
AskReddit,fe95b2g,t3_eo4wfw,1578934354.0,Depression is different in everyone but for me ups and downs come and go in waves. Sometimes I'll start feeling down out of nowhere and other times I think I or someone else triggers it.
AskReddit,fe94r8n,t3_eo5m4v,1578934251.0,Basically any conspiracy theory involving the government. Those fuckers are shady and I don't put anything past them.
AskReddit,fe94ktj,t3_eo5di6,1578934198.0,I would just take my husband's phone and call it from my phone. I'd tell him what's up ahead of time.
AskReddit,fe94eze,t3_eo5lyt,1578934137.0,"Milk. Seriously, my husband and I got through like 5 gallons of milk a week and I don't know how."
AskReddit,fe945it,t3_enut7n,1578934026.0,"Basically an I-don't-love-you-anymore conversation from a guy I had been dating for 5 years. He didn't just simply say, ""I don't love you anymore,"" but he gave me lots of lovely examples like that he got annoyed when he held my hand, and that when he saw I had texted him he wanted to throw his phone across the room, and that he dreaded my texts that I was done with work because that meant to he had to see me, and how when I'd cuddle up to him it took everything in him not to move away from me. 

It was the idea that every little thing about my existence just annoyed him."
AskReddit,fe8c08h,t3_eny7ma,1578924624.0,"My high school tried to ban all ""drinking containers"" including clear, plastic water bottles because people would still sneak in alcohol. The rule was basically if you're thirsty, we have water fountains. However, teachers would constantly be writing passes for people to get a drink of water all during class and other teachers just refused and demanded we get water in between class. That rule didn't last long."
AskReddit,fe8bff1,t3_eo3q9l,1578924482.0,"I'm fired, I'm losing my professional license, and I'm going to prison and being put on a sex offender list. I work with child victims of abuse, mostly sexual."
AskReddit,fe8abjv,t3_envws2,1578924178.0,"I think play is super important and there are so many ways to do it. It could mean literally playing games together (video games, board games, cards, etc.), being ""childish"" together (my husband and I start random tag wars), and just have lots of time where you laugh and just enjoy each other's company while having fun in simple ways."
worldnews,fdqqamu,t1_fdpp1sv,1578672579.0,"I worked at a preschool for several years and would have to call the front desk for a bathroom break. 90% of the time, nobody was at the front desk because those people actually had jobs too besides sitting around waiting to cover classrooms when teachers needed bathroom breaks. I completely understand why I can't just leave a class full of 3 year olds alone so I can go to the bathroom, but that job really made me appreciate the jobs I had following where I could go whenever I wanted!"
worldnews,fdhcx4i,t1_fdgcvyk,1578420132.0,And unnecessary capitalization.
worldnews,fdez6pe,t1_fddti93,1578349727.0,Yes! We don't need to wait for Iran! They can take care of his overseas properties while we take care of his shitty properties here!
worldnews,fdeyjrh,t3_eku1g1,1578349331.0,"I want to give major props to Iran for totally understanding that Trump and his administration is the issue and not the American people. Thank you, Iran. 

PS: I would be very happy if you destroyed all of Trump's properties."
AskReddit,fde3rcc,t3_ekt5n3,1578330524.0,"Nope. I have a really cool boss so I could literally say that I woke up late and don't feel like coming in. She'd cancel all my clients for me as well. However, I rarely take off work and am for the most part super responsible. If this was a consistent thing, I would definitely go in to work."
AskReddit,fcuf5ux,t3_eixc75,1577979473.0,I had a very good experience. I used eharmony and I went on one date with a pretty cool date and then another date with my future husband! I had my account for like a week and me and my now husband just clicked so well that we both deleted our accounts about a week after we met. I think my husband had been on eharmony for a year or so and had gone on several dates but it was much quicker for me.
