bipolar,fiu5b83,t3_f9gqfv,1582735398.0,"Tbh its my consciousness itself, as much as i might hate myself sometimes or want to kill myself, death has been my ultimate fear since i remember. But who knows sometime I have those moments i feel myself crumbling and those idea seems less and less scary as time goes on so maybe it will and maybe it wont hold."
bipolar,fitbmol,t1_fit9il2,1582713619.0,"I have my periods off and on weed, once in a while i take a break just to get my tolerance back down, nothing else changes accept i don't have weed to cheer me up when i am down. Last night was really bad because i was having a breakdown regardless of the weed, it just happened that i were high so it made it worse.

I am open minded to some other options as well, maybe i have something similar to bipolar but not quite. those are specifics i don't know yet and acknowledge i don't know them yet. I do differentiate between what I do know, what i probably know and what I don't know yet. But I know i can fully diagnose myself over time the same way psychiatrists do, i will start researching more about how they reach those diagnosis and why, and expand about symptoms and signs which I know I show many of them.

If a psychiatrist can diagnose me from getting an outside perspective of my mind, i imagine its possible to diagnose myself from having an inside look. Sure it might be hard because some people might twist reality, maybe focus on the wrong diagnosis, but i am not giving myself an easy time with reality by ignoring stuff, i have many points on why i am bipolar, many times i try to contradict my diagnosis and try to find reasons why I am not bipolar, why i am not traumatic, but each time i find counter arguments.

Also, i am getting into specifics of why stuff are happening like they are, why i am doing certain things, i find that i am brainstorming best while high but not always do it while high.

Regardless of my diagnosis, i found out stuff about myself, like memories i pushed away for reasons now know, and i know the effect it had on me.

There is so many stuff, but if i know something is that i know myself, the worst and the best, there is also much great things about myself i think about. For those reasons i think i am able to diagnose myself, because i truly know myself, i dont allow myself to be clueless about it"

That's when I started getting worried about my mental health, I have, since 16, had depression (not suicidal) with periods of time between them that I felt I could take over the world, I am amazing, I got into a huge manic episodes throughout my life and at one time worked out everyday between 2-6 hours a day for a month straight, I had manic episodes of probably a few months, but then I always have the crashes, those moments I start losing motivation, I stop caring about stuff, I get depressed, don't leave the bed, sleep 16 hours a day, and I never thought about any of it as more then up and downs, it seemed normal to me, but after that psychosis episode I realized something is seriously wrong with me and I then found bipolar which describes me exactly, I have been through exactly those things, I know myself better then anyone knows me, so when I reached a conclusion I am bipolar it was not an easy decision I had to rethink about over and over again, maybe I missed something, maybe it's in my head, everyday for the past week or so I am trying to find a a reason I am not really bipolar, I am over exaggerating, keep thinking back to all those moments, all those episodes throughout my life and it only confirms my beliefs, sometimes I forget that and again think I am exaggerating and start thinking how great I am but after how my previous two days went I realized oh right, I am getting manic that's why I am acting that way, and then I remembered all those manic episodes and understand there is no way around it. 
I don't want to be bipolar, I am scared to shit, I want to be normal don't you think, even if it meant I was as naive as others are.

Now I am just daydreaming about something that won't happen in the near future.
Also I believe our motivations are different, while you don't want to be where you are I have reasons behind them I really believe in, believe me it's not a simple decision for one to make, this style of training, and pushing yourself to limits, and training to shoot, what to do in combat, etc. Are really stuff that talk to me, I have been training for a year as much as I can in preparations for the army and my general health, sure had those big downs before, but I have a way of managing and pushing through it even if I have periods of time I am depressed, once the mania kicks (it can be for like two/three months no joke) I get instantly back on my feet, and start training with times of 2-6 hours a day, depending if I had 1:15 or 2:30 hours of mma that day or not on the weekend, i basically catch up with all the loss I had from that depressive period, I can achieve so much when I get into it, and I believe the army will amplify it more. Sure  I still need to get through though times once in a while, but that's just who I am I guess, and I don't want to lose that spark of me that keeps me strong and moving"

If I know it helps me to share that I will, but I don't see how it will, I probably won't want any passes and it's available information for the army that will probably fuck me up if I try to get certain roles, I doubt that it is something that will be passed over when they consider me for a role I might want, it will surely give me way less chance of getting it because hey who wants a mentally ill person in an important role that needs responsibilities and many more"
