news,fctb5hw,t1_fct6bn2,1577937833.0,"The National coronial information system identified 35 deaths from snake bites between 2000 and 2016. That‚Äôs roughly 2.2 deaths per year from snake bites, that‚Äôs less then the amount of people that have died in the fires from this year. 

Snakes are not that bad and venomous snakes play an important role in the ecosystem. Majority of snake species only bite humans if they feel scared/threatened. They don‚Äôt deserve to die because of the fires"
news,fcta4r1,t1_fct5gse,1577936999.0,"I understand that you don‚Äôt think they are downplaying it. But we have lost more then just 500 million animals, people have died trying to save entire towns from fires. People have died in their homes trying to protect their houses. Towns have run out of fuel for people to escape, hundreds upon hundreds of houses have been destroyed. Thousands of people are being sent to hospital due to smoke inhalation even thought they are nowhere near the fire, almost everywhere in Australia has been classified as dangerous to do physical activity due to smoke in the air. 

This isn‚Äôt some small issue, and 500,000,000 animals dieing in such a short period of time causes all sorts of issues on the natural ecosystem. This causes faaaaaar more damage then the cats, because it‚Äôs not just the animals lost, it‚Äôs also the vegetation. 

North America isn‚Äôt the only country with wild cat issues. Australia has had them too, they have been responsible for the extinction of numerous native species and kill millions of native animals per year. It made our media every now and again and the government put all sorts of actions in place to try to stop the wild cats. But the fires are exponentially worse then the wild cats! To even claim that wild cats killing birds is equal to these bushfires is absolutely crazy, the level of destruction is nothing alike."

news,fct4o5i,t1_fct2y3t,1577932788.0,"They aren‚Äôt getting downvoted because they made a comment about cats, they are getting down voted because they are playing down how bad the situation is when it is actually genuinely really bad.
