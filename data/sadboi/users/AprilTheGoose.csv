I am an atheist/skeptic, who has a hard time thinking outside the box of pure logic, and for a long time I thought Alan Watts was full of drivel. I felt like he was just saying lots of words and never getting to any point. 

But listen and let yourself think outside of the box a bit and you might find some threads of what feels like truth in the things he says. 

Somethigs can be true without being scientific. This is something I am still learning to have the courage to grasp, but Alan watts, once I put my skeptic shield down for a minute and REALLY listened was an ambassador for me to a new way of thinking. 

Very powerful and freeing, this way of thinking is. Spirituality separate from a specific religion. Even in a purely naturalistic world there is ample room for spirituality.

BTW I too suffer from this feeling of nothingness. I still feel it, but now with the benefits of dipping my tow into spirituality combined with about a year of therapy, i can at least see why I came to be this way and am working on breaking out of this mental prison.

Simple awareness is not enough, you have to have corective experiences to reprogram your brain to actually activate to let you feel differently.

The path to those corrective experiences will be different for everyone. Some need therapy, some only more spirituality in their life, some need more education, some just need a better social life... Good luck on your path."
