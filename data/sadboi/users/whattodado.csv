Anxiety,f7ylimg,t3_dy3mi5,1574097066.0,"On my very first date with my current SO I dragged him to the bathroom (dont know why I did that, I wasnt event thinking about it) and threw up in his toilet. I thought it was the because of the wine, but we later discovered it to be a regular occurance. I discovered my anxiety while being with him, and we kinda learned about it together. Frankly, I don't understand how this has never bothered him. Puking your guts out does not look cute. From day one to now (almost 5 years in) he has just wanted to help me, when I had no clue how to even help myself. Somehow, and I dont know how, it worked out. I had a panic attack last night, and he was okay with being there by my side while I shivered and tried to breathe. We both lost sleep over it. I wish I could chalk it up to good communication, but I had no clue what was going on with my body and no clue how to fix it. We just made it work. He slowly learned the best ways to support me when I was feeling like that, and I slowly learned methods to get through it. Somehow this has never been a dealbreaker for him, and somehow the increased anxiety has never been a deal breaker for me. We just knew that it was worth it to stay together despite the hardships.
I dont think my rambles have answered your question, but I hope my story has helped in some way. Best of luck!"
Anxiety,f7yilvc,t3_dy2hrk,1574095766.0,"My therapist told me that anxious people are the most hesitant to take medication. And I gotta say, it makes sense. Yeah, medication is freaking scary! You dont know how it will affect you, you're taking a huge leap of faith in a realm of science that is NOT well enough understood... and it's just too much. Too much to worry about. So it doesn't seem worth it to try.
A couple months ago I took that leap of faith (delaying it as long as possible and sobbing when I took my first antidepressant). So far it has helped me. Not so much the antidepressant, I mean, it's okay but I'm not too impressed. My doctor prescribed me Zofran ODT for the nausea and that was a miracle drug. You let it dissolve under your tounge, the taste is pleasant. And it really helps with the nausea. I know you're not looking for drugs, and if you choose not to I completely respect that.

Anxiety,f7aeerk,t3_dv1d0u,1573527185.0,"Female. Yes, sometimes it does. Looking back I realize it made me turn down spontaneous social events (though back then I didn't realize it was from anxiety really, I just made up some excuse as to why that event wasn't convenient for me). It has caused me to delay responding to texts/calls/misc. from my friends or family until I conveniently forgot about it, so I never got back to them. After a major panic attack (or while generally anxious) my appetite is severely reduced for a few days, so I can barely eat. In the worst moments I can't even be around rich/pungent foods, it would make me too sick. I once had to drive home early in the morning from a friend's place after throwing up all night. That was a scary drive, as I was still so nauseous. Anxiety has also caused me to miss a major exam.

Even last night I had a panic attack, and he was up with me until 3am while I was puking and shaking and trying so hard not to think about how much it sucked.

Impostor syndrome is real, and it's easy to feel discouraged, but take it from me. You aren't dumb. I get the feelings of inadequacy, but you can make it. Take it one day, one class at a time. When you climb up this mountain of education, it's easy to feel discouraged when you can't see the peak. Once in a while though, be sure to take the time to look back and see how far you've come.

Anxiety,f1dlfmm,t3_d8t6tg,1569388491.0,"I can only provide my personal experience here, but you have some great answers already! 

For me, there has always been a big difference between stress and anxiety. Stress, like the ""oh-shit-I-have-a-paper-due-tomorrow-that-I-totally-forgot-about"" kind puts me into a type of power mode. I get really focused. Yes, I am stressed (see also: frustrated, tense, worried), but I can still act and solve the problems at hand. The source of the stress is clear, and the method of getting rid of it is also clear. Anxiety (for me at least), has never been clear to me. Its just all of a sudden, for no logical reason, I wake up shaking. And nauseous. And my heart is beating fast, and I have to throw up, and there's no stopping this horrible exhausting feeling and I can't sleep because then I'll just wake up again to that horrible feeling and now I just have to wait it out until eventually three hours later.... it ends. No rhyme or reason. Maybe I can point it to something kinda stressful in my life, but for me, I was never ""worried"" about that event. My body just decided to freak out for me. 

Social anxiety has been a bit different too. In that case, I am mildly nauseous before and after social events, sometimes a little bit shaky. I tend to avoid social events that feel like ""a bit too much."" For me, that ""too much"" looks like there will be a lot of people I don't know, or it sprung up too suddenly, or it's at a place I'm not familiar with. My therapist has told me that's probably something to do with my lack of comfort in an uncontrolled environment. I don't know, we are still working on all that fun stuff. But that is how social anxiety ""affects"" my life. I don't go to stuff I don't feel comfortable going to. In the event my close friends invite me to hang out somewhere new, and soon, I usually say no, and make up some reason not to go. Not because I don't want to hang out with them, but because it's just a bit too much discomfort to feel worth it :/ 

So in both of these ways, the anxiety becomes overwhelming, or it causes me not do things I would otherwise like to do. 

I hope this helps. Anxiety isn't fun, but it can be managed (so I hear). I hope you find what works for you."

I would recommend trying to tell a few trusted members of your life anyway. Maybe write down the symptoms you feel when you feel them, so you have a better handle on how to describe it to others. They might not understand. If they don't, that sucks, but trust me it'll still be okay. I can really only speak from my personal experience with panic attacks, but for me they got much easier to deal with (mentally, at least) after I told the important people in my life what I was experiencing, whether or not they understood what that meant. 

As for dealing with them in the moment, for me the best things that have worked are breathing techniques, distractions like TV or music (or both), and walking around. You will eventually find the things that work best for you. Ultimately therapy or counseling is best for the long run (though I can't say its easy. I'm still working on that part of it)
