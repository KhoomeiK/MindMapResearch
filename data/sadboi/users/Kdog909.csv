Long version:

My wife divorced me out of the blue after 10 years together.  Our marriage was great, we were both happy, except for right before she left.

About 1 year before she left me, she got a new job.  She made several female friends there.  They were all young, single socialites that constantly went to bars/clubs together and would date guys for a month or two and then dump them, like it was a game.  Basically like a real life “Sex in the City” cast.  My ex-wife was the odd-one in the group.  She envied their lifestyles and it was completely obvious.  Within two months after leaving me and filing for divorce she had a new boyfriend.  He’s six years younger then her (10 years younger then me), is a Marine, has over 2000 Facebook friends, rides a motorcycle, travels the world, goes skydiving once a month...  Typical Alpha male.  (For the record, I was basically an Alpha myself, when I was in my 20s).

She took my entire life savings in the divorce.  We had separate bank accounts because she was a shopaholic who spent every penny that she made, and then some.  She paid none of the bills, none of our mortgage payments.

I was devastated, furious, confused... I couldn’t believe how someone who constantly swore she would be with me forever and ever could just drop me like that, basically cuz she was having a mid-life crisis.

My brother went through almost the same thing about a year before.  His girlfriend who he was with for 10 years cheated on him and left him.  This was after he supported her for years when she couldn’t work due to “anxiety”.

My brother went on dating sites a few months after that.  He said he got flooding with messages from girls wanting to date him.  He went on dates with over a dozen women.  He said they were all single moms.  They were also all either broke & in debt, crazy, drama queens, skanks, just looking for a free meal, or a combination of those.  They were all pretty much looking for an ATM.

My brother told me about MGTOW after my divorce, and I instantly knew that going my own way was a much better alternative that trying to get back in the dating scene at age 40.  I don’t need a woman to be happy, and definitely don’t want to get into another LTR just to be dropped for no reason."

I was naturally a bit shy and weird as a child. What really killed me though was that I had to move every two years growing up.  My father works for a small branch of the Army which requires constant moving.  I was always the new kid.  Most military kids only have to move two or three times and get to live on base.  Making friends is super easy living on bases because everyone is used to new kids showing up all the time.  My dad is a civilian though, so we couldn’t live on bases.

I could type a novel about how much that sucked, and having just a shitty childhood altogether.  Bottom line, I was always sad growing up so people didn’t really want to be around me cuz I was a downer.  

Finally overcame all of that in college.  Made tons of friends. Graduated, got married.  Then all my friends moved away, I got divorced (not my choice), and I’m back at square one.

Someone who makes $30,000 a year who gives $1,000 a year to charity is actually making a sacrifice.  They should be applauded.

Gates or Buffett giving away billions is a joke.  They have, for all intents and purposes, INFINITE money!  They are not generous, caring souls by giving away part of their infinite amount of money."

Also, pharmacists don’t get breaks because we are “health care workers”, who are exempt from any sort of breaks in most states.  I work 13 hour shifts with zero breaks all the time.  Using the bathroom is a luxury.

Illinois just passed a law that gives pharmacists an uninterrupted 30 minute lunch break when working over 8 hours.  So far, my employer pretends this law doesn’t exist. (Went into effect January 1st.)"

I used to work in a lab in the Medicinal Chemistry department of a major university.  It seemed quite obvious to me that the professors who were in charge of each project had dollar signs in their eyes.

Develop a new compound with potential medicinal effects.  The university, not the professor, will get to patent the compound and sell it to the highest bidder, but the professor will nonetheless become rich by taking a $1,000,000/year consulting job with the pharmaceutical company that buys the patent. Or by convincing investors to help the professor fund the establishment of a new pharmaceutical company and buy the patented compound that they developed back from the university.

Even better, the professor will almost always get a certain percentage of what the patent sells for.  Usually, it’s an “instant retirement” amount of money."

Of course, the richer the candidate, the more “volunteers” will be eligible for a stipend, and the stipend will be much larger.

There will ALWAYS be someone who has it worse than you.  That doesn’t mean that you can’t complain about your situation.

Also, I happened to learn from Google that you have a little thing called UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE over there in Romania.

Did you know that in the United States, someone who has Type 1 diabetes has to pay upwards of $600 per month for shitty health insurance?  Kind of difficult, even if you’re making twice the minimum wage."
