I myself was almost raped at 13 by my bestfriend/crush who was 3 years older than me. Took a while to say that out loud about one year ago. I guess I'm into more hardcore stuff but it can be hard to trust someone like that. I've had a little experience with sugar daddies but never actually went on dates, I wish I hadn't because I have guys from the sites crawling up my ass. Anyway, lots of crazy stuff is put on the internet and porn is an easy way to get paid and saying no right before is a difficult thing to do. Idk, there's a wide range of attitudes towards anything sexual so it's all in the eye of the beholder."

Guilt,fmtz6q7,t3_fx7iqa,1586381628.0,"Reading this has kinda brought back something for me but I was around 6 and didn't know what any of it was. I remember kissing my brother on the mouth and he was 4. I also remember a time when I got really into sexual stuff. It was past the age of 7, maybe around 8. I made a new friend and I can't remember her name. She was really popular and stuff and she invited me to her house. I don't remember much but we took turns kissing a stuffed horse she had and humping it's face, I remember not having a shirt but I don't think I was completely naked. 
I'm know me and my brother were abused a bit by our dad. He's from the mountain countryside with many siblings, he was the youngest but idk if he was hit alot or not. Not trying to defend him but he's had a lot of issues mentally and he stopped hitting us after I was 10, he still yelled at us but it's definitely better. 
Now my brother is interested in real death and abuse. He's sent me multiple decapitations and videos of animal and child abuse. My parents and I want to get him a therapist but we can't bc of the virus. I think my impulses have caused real damage.

She said if she could've she would have done the same to her first baby. 
The day after pill is a different story, it stops the body from doing it's work by making it sick. It's probably why you feel so bad and you're concerned about it. We are actual children and our parents shouldn't have to help raise them.

You should always have a friend to keep you in check at parties. I have been saved by my best friend too many times to count and idk how I'm gonna repay her but I will.
I'm also an empath and I want every one to be happy ya know and I can hear from both sides and get the picture, from what I hear she made a mistake and feels guilty. If you don't feel guilty for doing that then wtf is he doing with you ya feel me. It fucks you up and just spilling it all out to him would be healthy instead of hiding it, I know. Try to say everything first and see what he says, people get played dirty and sometimes you're the only one that can fix it.
And I'm sorry if I made you upset, my mom's gonna be alcohol free on February and I'm hella proud of her. I have dealt with addiction but it's not what you think, it's kind of silly.

AskReddit,fb6qu1b,t3_ebkocj,1576557410.0,"I don't work at a food bank but as someone that grew up going to the food bank once a week I can tell you some stuff.
Long shelf life foods are great, this is cans of soup and vegetables, ramen is very good as well. Tuna is a life saver and it's pretty cheap compared to other canned meats. Mac and cheese is a gift and putting some sweet stuff is good, jello, pudding and canned fruit is good. The really big bags of cereal are a good treat to eat dry and is very cheap. Getting discounted meat is a life saver and has alot of nutrition. Malnourishment can be a serious issue. My mom sold alot of heirlooms to buy food because she didn't want food from there but it's worth it. Discounted cakes are good for birthdays, we would go to a store and get them every once in a while.
I lived like this until middle school when I was 11, I'm 17 now and my parents have learned how to manage money better, they made very bad monetary choices and are still paying for it. 
Back then when I was 4 they got one of those suburb homes and they couldn't get a loan for a down payment and had to pay $1600 a month if I remember, things started to go down and every year the would get $1000 on Christmas and they were relying heavily on getting it and without warning she didn't give it to them and they lost the house by the time I was 7. We rented a small house and it was less than half of what they were paying in the other house and they didn't have to sell old and precious things.
We still live in that house and I wouldn't want another, the cookie cutter homes are too big for me. We don't have to scrounge for money and we have plenty of food for me and my brother, he's 3 years younger and doesn't remember but he doesn't appreciate it but I know.

I tried it for a week and it was expensive and horrible. I love meat and as bad as it sounds I've always wanted to try a solely carnivorous diet and yes it sounds awful and is way less sustainable than veganism but I'm all for experience. Treat them right and well and you can taste the lack of cruelty in the meat. Giving them a good life is very important but trying to change people is going to make it worse. Also it's annoying to be called a ""monster"" for eating the things we have evolved to eat. It's a waste and what are we going to do with the mass population of cows, pigs, chickens and lesser known animals. Are we going to get peta to euthanize them all!? It defeats the point, give them full healthy lives and once they decline give them a good last few hours and give it to the people. 
Complaining is annoying as hell and makes people hate you, pushing for world vegetarianism or veganism would destroy the world water sources and be very unhealthy.

AskReddit,fb1qjnk,t3_eauhhu,1576439803.0,"I have a combo of mood disorders(bipolar, severe depression, and seasonal affective) and they are unpredictable and extreme. I've missed school for a month and a half. I've dealt with self harm and I do it on my inner thigh so it's not as noticable but it is. I had an almost successful suicide attempt on May 23 of this year. Took an old of promethazine (nausea Ned that makes you sleepy) and after a few minutes my self preservation instincts kicked in and I tried to make my self puke and I had to literally shove my hand down my throat and I managed to get most of it out but I suffered from the side affects and felt awful. That was the first time I was serious and hopefully the last. I do think about it as one does but not serious enough to go through with it, I say ""if my brain wants to stop existing then she better give me heart failure"" bc I'm super lazy and it's a good way to think about it.
Some people thought I died or dropped out, one person thought I moved and didn't tell anyone. I've been dealing with this all of high school and I'm a senior. Everyday I wanted to drop out but I was already this far.
Though since sophomore year I've had my ""senior plan"" if I wasn't happy with myself and situation when I graduate then I'll get it over with. Part of it is the fear of not graduating on time. My GPA from freshman year was.001, I failed every class due to ATTENDANCE even though I had solid 80s and 90s. I hate home work but I learn quickly when I have lectures and by the end of those first 2 semesters the grade fluctuated alot. Sophomore year I got it up to 1.6 and recovered many classes and last year's gpa went up to a 2. Keep in mind it is weighted and they put me in honors classes to my high 80 and up exams but I failed not turning in work. I've come very far but I'm still so tired, having to stand my ground against the feelings and it turned parasitic. I'm an artist and Drew what it felt like and now that's how I see it. It gives me comfort in that I can rest easy and that it cares about me and wants to protect me but I know better. Though I keep him around as an excuse to hide in my room and be self destructive.
Even in my depressive state I love my physical appearance and almost all attributes of my personality, mega smart, quick, charming but the only thing that has ever held me back is my laziness and it has gotten to me.
 This year I got a new councilor and she has turned my situation around and actually cares about me. All my teachers are patient with me when I don't do my work and I had psychology with one of them 2 years ago and he is trying to help me catch up in that ap human geo class which is a fast paced class and missing a lesson isn't good. Wanting to recover is a big part of this.
We really do have our battles, most of the time I'm manic and love myself, I'm bright and cheery and I love everyone and I really do try to help everyone with their things before focusing on myself. I've been told I'm a truly good person but it can be hard to believe sometimes. It's hard to be nice sometimes and I do talk it out in an intimidating way even as a 5'2 average female when I need to but it's rare.
 My greatest fear is disappointing everyone especially my parents. Seeing as I'm a person with limitless potential, the expectations were always so hard and it felt like I was turning to stone and my feet gave in and crumbled. I was born perfect accept for my hereditary disorders at severe cases, and very bad eyes(at about 10 inches from my face things get blurry). It's my only downfall, I recall one time I was with a friend and met their dad for the first time, my friend always talks about what he said ""if you read more you could take over the world"" and I believe it. I get most of my knowledge from random things on YouTube and if I tried I think I would get very close. 
I just want to get back to that manic feeling, I describe it as ""I am Jesus"" type of mood and I say that alot. 
I have many friends who are supporting me. I've recently been accepted into an academy 8 hours away that helps girls like me and the only reason I can go is because it's 100%covered by insurance(my family is in between 3rd and 2nd class). I was hopeless and helpless for so long and just gave up on all of it but when I actually had a chance to get better I put in the effort to get better I was already at the first step to recovery. I'm going to leave in one to two weeks, they will let us know when they have space and I will be there until February. That's second semester and I'll only have two classes each in the afternoon making my life so much easier. I'm ready to be myself again and get out there in all aspects. I hope that everyone here gets better too! This stuff is hard to deal with and I'm an empath so get better before come over there and love you.
Fecking beautiful people, absolute treasures!"

unpopularopinion,faj4ysq,t3_e9bbi2,1576124619.0,"My uncle is dealing with a similar situation atm. My cousin Morgan was made by my uncle and his gf at the time Stacy. They didn't use protection bc they're both alcoholics and I love him but I wouldn't let Morgan be raised by him on his own but the alternative is awful.
Story time, Stacy's crazy, 3 kids with her first husband(no custody), Morgan(half) and her baby Roman. She recently lost custody of Roman bc her bf didn't want to get married and she endangered him or something. I think she was watching his kids and they were at a hotel and she went to the bar and the 4 year old went out into the hallway. The place was shady and thankfully someone who wasn't a pedo got them and yeah. 
My uncle's a chronic alcoholic, starts drinking around 10 or 11 in the morning and drinks continuously til 4 when he gets home and watched Morgan (he lives with his mom in a condo and she can hardly take care of herself and she doesn't get alot of money) but he starts drinking again around dinner and that's from 6 to 9 depending on the day. 
Currently within the past few months Stacy kept Morgan for a month even though it's a weekly trade off. This is highly illegal, honestly I could compare it to child kidnapping and she did it for the dumbest reason.
Now Morgan is a smart lil punk, started lying at a young age(indicates intelligence) and she does crazy stuff all the time. This kid went to the 4 car lot under the condos(this is on Roanoke island NC btw) and across the street is parking spaces and the canal, you can see where this is going. This child, hardly 3 feet tall, gets in his old ass car( not familiar but an old hatchback maybe, the kind that doesn't require pressing the brake to change gear). She manages to put the gear shift in reverse, she walks around on her own alot there bc it's a nice ""white"" neighborhood and he walked out and saw her and she was in the middle of the street when he stopped that shit bc he can't afford a loss like that.
He tells this to Stacy as a warning that she can do this and she decides that he isn't ""responsible"" enough and keeps her for weeks, listen I get it but on god she has no right to talk, she's always late to meet up and is hella petty and he still keeps up to the agreement no matter what bc he's playing that long game. Morgan has come home dirty in dirty clothes and I'm not talking about a kid rolled around in dirt I mean you can smell the build up of gunk between her toes and he hair is a rats best. It's a shame bc she has a cherry blonde color hair type and I can't but they are going to go to court around Christmas and hopefully they will take my uncle's side. Stacy's parents were helping her with Morgan and Roman but they got tired of it and told her to get a job. He's got good family and they can actually provide for her. I hope Stacy goes to prison cuz she's an entire cunt.
 I feel bad for that judge, poor bastards gonna go through hell."

My parents were very supportive but I can tell it's starting to get on their nerves alot. They've started yelling at me more over not doing more work. I snapped at my mom yesterday, we did work outside and we had moved the cars and they wanted me to move them back, I had laid down and my stomach was upset and standing up was impossible without swaying. My mom came into my room 3 times asking me to do it, to be fair it was the easiest thing to do but I just couldn't move without being in pain. She snapped and yelled at me and I had told her my stomach was upset and she had snatched my phone earlier. She gets major mindgranes and I said the next time she has one she won't get any sympathy from me and she threw it right next to my head and left. I felt like crap but I couldn't get up and I just fell asleep. I had been sleeping alot lately, 12 hours a day if not more. I still feel like crap for doing that even after apologizing.

depression_memes,f9ijar6,t3_e48kgb,1575338515.0,"I kinda have it the other way around. I invite people over alot, about 2 to 3 times a month. Being in high school is difficult and they have jobs and their own problems but even when I give them 2 weeks advance, my best friend always goes and another got grounded but the other 3 just didn't answer in the group chat. I know one of them has had some problems with a friend and I actually fixed it, them and another friend of mine had a miss communication and long story short I was out of school for a month, went back one day and fixed it and I only feel gratitude from the other party. 
My best friend Kai never fails to disappoint me, they have gone lengths to see me and help me. Even if it got them in trouble they still did it. I had helped them with a lot in the past and I think they're trying to make up for it in a way but I do feel that I have gotten in the way. I have asked them for money on stupid shit, not even food and they happily oblige. Keep in mind Kai is the most hard working person I know, all honors and AP, works 4 to 10 on weekdays, probably 9 to 12 on weekends and they still manage to keep it together and I admire them so much and I feel like I'm lesser next to them. 
Kai even praises my on my looks and intelligence, I won't doubt that but being smart doesn't matter if you have a force taking away your motivation to do anything with it. I've been on serious medication for 3 years now, I'm a senior and I have a full schedule as of right now(4 classes) and next semester it's only 2 classes in the afternoon no less. Literally apparel 2(counts as a math cred) and English, that's it. My teachers and counselors have already stuck their necks out for me and I still never seem to give enough. 
Being in a bad financial situation and having an awful gpa from earlier years has made it almost impossible to do anything. I already have to try harder than others but it's just difficult to do the norm of things.
I really went off I have many issues atm but I'm hoping to do good on exams as I always do, its usually the only way I pass but never the less you will feel like no one understands you but they do, they just show it in a different light.
Good luck out there fellas, even darkness must pass. It doesn't have to be through death but a change in yourself, love everyone, feckin beautiful people. On god if y'all say some shit like UuuUuHGh iM sOOooOO sTupId aND uGlY you better STFU and stop talking to yourself like that. I used to think that way until I opened my eyes to the thing that are special about me and it has made it way more bearable but I still have a ways to go. Like I said love y'all feckin live for yourself, if your brain wants to die it better put in the work of shutting them shits down. Glorious people💙"
changemyview,f9i9m5u,t3_e51iaw,1575331628.0,"I kinda agree actually, let's say you met someone black from another country. How exactly would you address it, you couldn't say African American. These notions make it difficult when it doesn't really matter. Accidentally calling a Korean Chinese is seen as bad, which I can attest to but how could you identify where a white person comes from, looking at me I could be Slavic, scandinavian, Germanic and that's not even half. Asians are Asians, blacks are blacks and whites are white. There is nothing wrong with saying that. Personally another thing I think is weird is how blacks say they're proud of their skin, totally agree but if I, a pale ass white girl, said I was proud of my skin I probably would get called racist by someone sensitive. 
Honestly I don't care but in the way that yeah that's where your from and that's cool but let's just talk as if we aren't different.

I have stolen makeup, clothes and jewelry. Though we do have bad money problems I know we don't need this. I have skipped a couple items in self checkout on meat and frigging toilet paper and paper towels, oh God they're so feckin expensive like you have no idea. I've gone on sprees to multiple stores.

Keep in mind I have a moral system, I'm chaotic good basically, I do break the law by stealing but I do get gifts for people a lot and saving food money for other things like crippling debt. I don't steal from thrift stores but everything else is fair game, if I know that a sweater isn't worth 20 and a 8 year old Taiwanese kid made it for .03 cent then you know damn well I ain't gonna give it to em.

I went ahead and used soap and water to scrub it off with my fingers, it was very painful but after it healed way faster.

Bad habits often stop us from doing the things we need to do and asking for help is absolutely okay, you're not taking away anyone's time and they want to help, . Once you get that push and there's no going back you just say f it and coast, then you realize you were being dumb. I realize it doesn't make sense and I should take my own advice. People care, get the help you need and even though it can't be cured it can be coped with when you have the right resources and support. Frickin love you"
