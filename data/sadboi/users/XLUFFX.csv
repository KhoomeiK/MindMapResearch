The tables turned the first time I smoked weed. I smoked way too much for my first time and got extremely high, but it felt like the high would never go away. Every day felt like a dream, like I wasn't in my own body, but I knew I was. I did research and found a video on YouTube where this girl described feeling like she's always dreaming and it immediately clicked. I discovered that it was caused by anxiety and the real reason it happened was because my brain was trying to make me think I was dreaming to relief some of the stress, but it only makes me more stressed. 

Recently though I've been speaking with a therapist and I've started Zoloft a few days ago which will hopefully relief some of my chronic anxiety. If not I am pretty much out of luck with things I can try."

For the most part my co-workers aren't sexist as I have been working with them for over 5 years now and they know what I'm capable of. However the contractors we hire out aren't the same. They talk to me as if I'm a child and ignore my input, while they speak to my boss as if he is one of their own doing ""bro hugs"" and explaining in greater detail how things work even though my boss doesn't know shit and is hardly doing the manual labor me and the other managers do.

It was about a 2 hour walk which I had done before. In that time 4 men who walked past me commented on my appearance. One man stopped his car in front of me while I was crossing the street and stopped me from getting across in broad daylight on a busy road. No one cared. The scariest thing that happened was when a guy stopped his car next to me on a quiet neighborhood road and started asking me if I was single and if I wanted to go out with him. I try to ignore them but it makes me so angry. How can you think it's okay to just stop someone who is walking and harass them.

I've spent probably $2000+ on textbooks that I never even opened. It's impossible to make friends and college counselors give conflicting information. On top of it all you slowly go into debt and spend all your free time on homework or working a minimum wage job just to be able to eat.

Not to mention the college admissions process is the most conflicting stupid and overall stressful process I've ever had to go through in my entire life.
