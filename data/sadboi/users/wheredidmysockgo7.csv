So, sometime in the first 2 weeks of school I’ll be contacting you""

There was no convenience and no super easy access David was a shepard. He of course had strength and was built well. If I messed that up my bad I'm an aithest so I don't know much about Christian culture. He also was in charge of how statues of himself looked. He was able to make himself look however he wanted in sculptures.

How she uses it isnt related to to her quirk. Mineta's quirk could be great if he knew how to use it better. But your oc can create deadly diseases, use them however he wants, and has zero drawbacks. Momo, like I said, can only create what she has extended knowledge about, use them primarily for what's intended because it has to be a real thing before she can create it, and has to have the fat lipids to do so. What I suggest is, A. Dull down the quirk. Make it so they can only temporarily give the disease and create known diseases. B. Give it a rather even set back. Maybe a 50/50 chance of the disease affecting the user. C. Give it specifications, quirks usually aren't automatically deadly. Make it so the person needs to know something about the disease when in creation. 
These are purely suggestions. All I'm saying is, the quirk is a bit op."
