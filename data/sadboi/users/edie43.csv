As in: “I gave birth to my daughter/I have a son” and it might just be me reading into things, but could it be that your husband isn’t as involved with your kids? Like, does he actually spend time with them, does he have a relationship with them that isn’t just telling them off/telling them what to do? Does he look them in the eyes and have conversations with them (yes, even the 6 month old)?

I wish we could see more of a diverse look on EDs in popular culture instead of the old “white skinny and beautifu”-trope that we still see today. It would make it easier for me to accept my ED, not to mention easier for the people around me to understand it.

I’ve also felt quite demotivated (to say the least) when it comes to the fact that people seldom recover when they’ve had it for a long time. But I’ve decided to just accept that quasi-recovered is better than nothing and be open to the possibility that I can be one of the few who can recover eventually. No pressure on myself."

EatingDisorders,fn2bgk9,t3_fypjqd,1586583411.0,"When I first told my bf I was bulimic it didn’t go well either. It turned out a few months later that he hadn’t even really taken it seriously when I told him. I blamed him for a while but now I realise that there is no way he could have known how to react because he had no experience with eating disorders at all.

I agree with the comment that says you should be open about what you’re thinking right now. Tell her you’re sorry things went the way they did and that you’re just unsure how to support her but that you want to be there for her. 

I brought my bf to see my therapist recently and she told him that he shouldn’t change his life or act as a carer for me, but just be there as a support and understand things like the how my moods can go up and down while I’m in treatment. 

OP, you sound like a really good person, as long as you keep the attitude you’re showing in your post and be sure to ask her what she needs from you, you’ll be fine and there’s not much more you can do. Of course you can encourage her to get help, but don’t push her. And lastly I want to say that you haven’t made things worse over the course of your marriage. Unless you’ve actively shamed her for her body or tried to make her lose weight, you’ve acted the way any person would in a normal relationship. You didn’t know and you shouldn’t beat yourself up for it.
