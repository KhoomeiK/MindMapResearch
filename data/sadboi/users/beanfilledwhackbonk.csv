grammar,fr30er6,t3_gm8w17,1589847436.0,"Yes, while both are incorrect, they imply different things.

A is wrong because ""spent time"" indicates that this trip to Dominica happened in the past, while ""are recovering"" is present continuous (used for something ongoing). As far as I can tell, this construction is logically incorrect. 

E is... less wrong. The problem with using ""recover"" here (since we're talking about the past) is that it implies the volunteers were trying to find out how Dominicans recover *in general*. Using present tense this way would make more sense if you were talking about observing something people there do all the time, like saying ""I went to study table tennis in China to find out how they train.""

B is the best choice, because ""had recovered"" indicates that the recovery had already finished. It would also be fine to say ""...to find out how they were recovering"" if the recovery were still ongoing.
