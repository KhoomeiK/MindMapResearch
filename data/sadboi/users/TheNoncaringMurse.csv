Divorce_Men,fnrkk8b,t3_g3fs7p,1587191913.0,"I told her I wanted to talk to her, she said ""what the fuck do you want to talk about?"" in a nasty tone. I walked up to her, looked her in the eye and said ""I don't want to live in a drug house, I don't want to be with you anymore, I'm getting a divorce.""

Her son was selling drugs, pills like oxy, out of our house with her denial of it all even with my taking pictures of the stash of drugs, he had moved a 15 year old into his bedroom with her consent, shit was going sideways. 

Pro tips: give her the house and the mortgage on it and watch her work as hard as you used to so she can make the mortgage. Live very simply after that apartment or something small for you and your children, love grows best in little houses, and make boundaries right away with the children where you are getting them as much as possible from the beginning after you leave. I have my son more than half the time because she is working all the time, I took her back to court and since she was working a lot of overtime to try to keep her house her income was actually greater than mine and now I pay nothing in child support. Her son went to prison because he was a violent, drug, dealing asshole and committed armed robbery 6 months after I was gone. Life is good."

The seroquel is just there to stop you from being up all night and day doing self destructive behaviors. I was on lithium, then valproic acid, and I have been on lamictal for about 10 years or so. Only and only when I am struggling do they use something to treat symptoms. Lamictal is like a flintstone vitamin for crazy people, you take it every day, there is no side effect, and I am not manic and doing self destructive behaviors.

If you take a Polaroid of a naked 12 year old girl you cannot own that. It is illegal and you cannot engage in the act of creating it. So if I use your logic you can no longer own bullets, you can no longer own guns and you can no longer put bullets into guns and shoot them as a private citizen.

Ahhh yes this argument I was waiting for this one so I go back to my drinking and driving analogy. Before I was born people were in pictures holding a martini glass and driving their Model T fords down the road. When I was young they made a legal limit for drinking and driving but you could still be pretty buzzed more accidents and more deaths and dismembering of limbs, and there were also only 4 billion people on the planet. Then when I was a teenager they tightened the legal limit down to about one drink. As I tell my 11 year old son who hopefully never is in a mass shooting, There are 8 billion people on the planet now and not all of them are smart. Sometimes idiots fuck up the fun for the rest of us. I would love to back the 2nd amendment and go to the range with my friends who have guns because its super fun to go shooting. I would love to think that my neighbors wear a gun vest all the time and if someone breaks in they can gun down the robber. But I believe we need a 28th Amendment no more guns for private citizens. Military and police only and if you are a hunter or rancher you can go through a  stringent background check and own One hunting rifle. 

We had an amendment taking away ownership of people as slaves so we can have an amendment taking away ownership of Guns. I am done. Its not sensationalism it is really happening and they are not even talking about the victims anymore and barely talking about the criminals its just factual “today 20 people were killed in El Paso” cold hearted.
