TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fqt7iln,t1_fqt17mw,1589632318.0,"You say that like children don't walk, stand, and carry themselves differently than adults do. They have less practice on two feet and less stress being held in their bodies. Their chests are usually puffed out and open because they haven't been crushed by life yet. They also seem to be more stiff in their extremities than adults are. Not sure what that's about. There are many ways to copy a five year olds body language. Now I want to know how our posture changes while growing and why children have the postures they do! Lol"

mentalillness,fqsuk1l,t3_gkc52x,1589619355.0,"Thank you so much for sharing your story. I didn't see how long it has been up, but it seems underrated. I thoroughly enjoyed the read. Your story helped me understand some things about my ex and his insecurity. It's really helpful as I, like you, learned to blame myself, my insecurities rather, on people's treatment of me. So being able to wrap my head around the superior behavior of another is emotionally freeing for me. So thank you! ðŸ’œ

I absolutely love that a genuine good deed was thing to turn things around for you. I just think that's incredible. It's difficult to do good deeds, especially for me, because I always seem to have an element of selfishness to it. I do plenty of good deeds on a regular basis, but I guess they're not really good deeds because I do them to be seen as good. Well, I also them because I think it will help people, but it seems my insecurities overshadow that. You've given me much to think about.

I'm really happy for you that you've been able to find inner fulfillment in life. That's amazing and you should be endlessly proud of yourself! I think we're all more blessed for having heard your story! Thanks again!"

MtvChallenge,fqkfzbj,t1_fqka19o,1589426476.0," Completely ridiculous that Tori had to console Jordan after she lost an elimination and remind him that she did her best versus Jordan consoling Tori and letting her know she did her best.

CPTSD,fqhiwki,t3_givgqr,1589377908.0,"I can relate a little. When I first found this sub, the first year of being on it, I would come to r/cptsd every night before logging off for bed. It gave the comfort of feeling understood and not feeling alone. I had finally found others like me and it gave me such relief. I also withdrew more and more from others but, they were people that hurt me. People that didnt understand me and didnt want to try. People who invalidated me. For the first time ever, this sub provided me with the support I needed so badly and helped me to stop letting others abuse me. It strengthened my voice I had inside all along, but had silenced due to the oppression I endured. I'm so so grateful for this sub."

I couldn't find the motivation to keep doing it and eventually had to put it away because a new puzzle came that I was actually excited to do! Maybe I'll try it again because I don't like leaving things undone. But I didnt think it was anywhere near as fun as the Indian feather!  Do you have any other favorite Bgraamiens? I'd like to try more."

I was NOT happy about it and never been happy about it since. I dislike Mother's Day and would be quite happy if I never heard of it again. Also, it's stupid."

How about at least a 90 day rule for introducing significant others, especially with her track record. If I were Gary, I'd make it six months because again, her track record. Gary should be protecting Leah but instead he is worried about that MTV paycheck. It's dispicable."

Gary needs to stop enabling Amber and tell her how crazy she's acting!! And make a rule about Mom introducing boyfriends to Leah. Like, how about at least a ninety day rule?

MadOver30,fpnqimh,t3_gehfhp,1588770351.0,"I'll share some of my story. I had severe attachment trauma in early childhood and grew up in an abusive and toxic household which compounded the trauma I already had and added to it. I was never able to get better until I spent nearly a decade outside of the environment. It wasn't until I had enough distance between myself and the people who were toxic for me that I started to become aware of the reality that I endured. How I was abused and brainwashed and even had repressed memories surface. Well, I've spent the last 7-8 years recovering from it all. I had a whole host of cluster b personality disorder symptoms and a bunch or diagnosis depending on which Dr you talk to. Anyway, I had faith I could get better but not so much in doctors. I started googling everything. My symptoms, how I was feeling. All the stuff I couldnt talk to a doctor about. Google really saved my life. My other point is that it has taken years of teeny tiny steps in progress while having pretty bad depression pretty much the entire time for me to get better. If it wasn't for little insights or the smallest piece of progress, I don't know how I would have made it. Listen to your heart. Don't let any doctor tell you that you can't get better if you believe you can. It takes time though. It took me so much time. I literally thought it would be like two years and I'd be where I imagined, healthy on all levels. It's almost eight years later and although I'm really close, I'm not quite there yet. I just want to say, don't give up. Focus on your progress, no matter how small. Meditate. It will help you start to feel these patterns that drag down your mental state. It's the best thing you can do for yourself, develop a regular meditation practice where you focus on the breath. I'm sorry you're struggling so much with depression. It's the worst. I know. But you can get better. If you need anything, don't hesitate to PM. Support and validation is really important. You don't have to deal with it alone. Feel better."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fpnncvx,t1_fpnmnv6,1588768101.0,"I dig it. It may not be much, but he still doesn't need the money like that and even if he did, would it be worth sacrificing what Leah is exposed to? Idk. I wouldnt want that sort of example around my impressionable preteen. 

""Leah's mom."" Heh. I like that. She really is her mom though. Maybe that's part of how they justify allowing it. Amber is so checked out when it comes to being a mom that Leah probably looks at her like a estranged big sister or an aunt therefore they see her influence as almost non existent. Again, idk. But man, what a poor kid to have to deal with all that. I can't imagine what it is like in school for some of these teen mom kids. And high school? That's right around the corner for them. Poor babies."

That people need to be corrected physically. He has no clue what a healthy argument looks like or how to express your feelings in a healthy way.

NarcissisticAbuse,fpjlhod,t3_gdtqw2,1588672990.0,"Oh man this sounds familiar. And honestly been some of the hardest words to let go of. Mine was ""You need someone to beat your ass."" His way of justifying abusing me saying it's the only way to deal with me because I deserve it. 

It took a while for me to realize that he was actually talking about himself as far as what he believed in. He grew up with an abusive father and is one of those that believes in corporal punishment but doesn't consider how it crosses the line into abuse. 
He'd verbally eviscerate me and nothing I did worked for him to stop. I'd stay quiet, I'd walk away, I'd try to reason. His anger would persist. I felt like he wanted me to lash out physically. I'm someone that can control myself. I learned my lesson on that. But on two occasions I decided to sort of experiment and see what happened. So I hit him. Open handed, on the shoulder, hard enough. Both times, two seperate times, and he immediately stopped. Didnt say another word. Internally I was just like, ""whoa"". Granted he threw it in my face months later when playing victim so I knew he told people I beat him but it didnt bother me. He doesnt realize that I made the choice to do it. He thinks I lost control. 

Anyway, these things together helped me understand his distorted mentality. I hope this helps you and maybe helps you realize that her verbal assaults on you are nothing more than a projection of her own distorted reality. It isnt you."

survivorsofabuse,fpj9i8o,t3_gdqqvq,1588660730.0,"I can relate. In my opinion, it is completely normal to have these feelings. It's a normal reaction to an abnormal situation. They robbed you of your health and safety and disempowered you, among other things. Fantasizing about killing them is a way to take your power back. I fantasized about kidnapping my abusers and basically torturing them until they confessed the truth because I needed to hear it so bad. I fantasized about it off and on for months. Eventually I was able to deal with my feelings and the rage subsided. I'd say it is part of the healing process. Of course you know that by following through, you'd just be allowing them to hurt you again because of the repercussions. As long as you play that part out and realize that it wouldn't be worth it, then I would assume it is safe to allow yourself to feel the way you feel. There's a difference between having feelings and acting on them. So I'd say, it's ok. You have a right to feel that way. I'd stay away from them and focus on yourself. You deserve a life with your health and security and power intact. You'll get there."
