Anxiety,fn5po33,t1_fn4z1bs,1586671718.0,THIS. I feel this on such a deep level.
Depersonalization,fn3wln9,t3_fz9kc3,1586629343.0,"This happened to me too. I accidentally got too high and had a severe panic attack. I felt fine for like a week afterward and then out of nowhere I started to experience the exact same feelings of being really high even when I was 100% sober. Initially, it was really scary and I thought I was losing my mind but once I realized it was a form of depersonalization, the fear lessened. What helped me the most was to continue to live my life normally despite the weird sensations. It sucked to try to be “normal” when I felt strange but not being scared was so important for me. When I let the feelings exist alongside my daily life, they weren’t that bad. I still experience these feelings sometimes but I kind of just let them chill until they want to go away. Remember that these feelings aren’t harming you or putting you in any danger, you’re gonna be okay :)"
Anxiety,fn2uu6g,t3_fyxplv,1586604193.0,"I’m going through this exact thing right now. If I wake up to go to the bathroom, my thoughts instantly take over and then I end up staying up for hours trying to distract myself on my phone :/ something about night time is especially triggering"
Anxiety,fmmwcfz,t3_fw7yaj,1586213335.0,"Some of these questions really made me reflect deeply on my life, thank you and good luck!"
Anxiety,fmjup2d,t1_fmjtqs8,1586138129.0,"Im currently only eating 2 meals a day so I’m definitely gonna be splitting my meals up a bit, I’ve never thought about that. Thank you so much!"
Anxiety,flyqtxk,t3_frzqr3,1585607293.0,I feel this :/
Anxiety,flm5yui,t1_flm2ydb,1585275359.0,Exactly! Feel free to PM me whenever you feel the need to talk or rant about it. I know how hard it can be to talk about it all and it helps a lot to talk to people who have also dealt with it
Anxiety,flm1y2w,t1_fllzz1n,1585272703.0,"Yeah I completely understand. Unfortunately, there's no quick fix. I often thought going for a run or meditating a few times would ""cure"" me and when it didn't I would feel even more defeated.   
The only thing that truly helped was recognizing how harmless it was. It's just a weird feeling, you're going to be okay! A lot of people have felt like this and were able to overcome it, you can too."
Anxiety,fllsmfa,t3_fplgie,1585266903.0,"I had a severe episode a while ago that lasted around 3 weeks. It was the most terrifying thing and I spent so much time trying to figure out how to cope with it. The more I stressed about it, the worse it got. I know it's really scary but I cannot stress how important it is to not be afraid. Understand that its a harmless coping mechanism that your mind uses to help with stressful situations. Acknowledge that you're feeling like this and remember that it's only temporary. Keep yourself busy and live your life as you normally would and it'll eventually subside."
HealthAnxiety,fl6oquf,t3_fmdrrb,1584878196.0,I’m 21 and have had floaters for as long as I can remember. I figured they were common because Family Guy did a bit on them once. It’s important to remember that you’ve probably always had them but your anxiety makes you hyper aware of them.
Anxietyhelp,fl5sswf,t1_fl5nt63,1584844789.0,"I second this, unfortunately :/"
UCSantaBarbara,fkixyjo,t3_fis4tk,1584231302.0,Me. Can’t get in contact with housing either because they’re closed
HealthAnxiety,fkbm2xe,t3_fhk1y9,1584035520.0,"Same thing happened to me a few years ago except it had to do with my vision. A doctor told me I could go blind within the next few years because of an enlarged nerve and I spent 2 years living in fear that my eyesight could go at any moment. I switched doctors, got extensive tests done, and it turns out my eyes are perfectly healthy. The relief was unimaginable, glad you’re okay OP."
Anxiety,fk1gz59,t1_fisvh3n,1583779475.0,"I just came across “At Last a Life” by Paul David and it’s changed my view on anxiety/intrusive thoughts, highly recommend. It’s available as a free PDF online."
anxietysuccess,fj9ua7d,t1_fj85pj3,1583159761.0,Thanks!
anxietysuccess,fj84p11,t3_f7wz26,1583105088.0,"I'm having difficulties finding the free version and I think this book would be really helpful so if anyone finds it, PM me!"
Anxietyhelp,fixhhyp,t3_f97l0o,1582820481.0,"I’m in the same boat. It usually happens a few times a night and it’s really hard to get back to sleep. This may sound silly but I usually imagine sheep jumping over a fence and I count them as they go over. It gives me something to focus on, the anxious thoughts subside, and I’m able to drift off to sleep before I even reach 10 sheep."
UCSantaBarbara,f9qy362,t1_f9qqrt5,1575568566.0,I would also be very interested in joining one!
