infp,fqoszuv,t3_gjuk95,1589523952.0,"I've also avoided confrontation my whole life, but it's caused a lot of distress in my life and I've made a lot of decisions that weren't my own because I just deferred to someone's else's judgement to avoid conflict/confrontation. I've been going to therapy for almost a year now, trying to work through a lot of shit, and one thing my therapist has me working on is the *dreaded confrontation*, meaning initiating it. 

Basically FIRSTLY start small (for me that meant asking the guy at the lab bench next to me to please stop taking my Acetone bottle and not putting it back - it went really well! He even bought me a coffee to apologise), 
SECONDLY for me it was to learn how I can better handle the situation, and for me that meant writing it down on paper and reading it. I become inarticulate when I'm stressed out (even more so than I generally am..) and I find it easier to put my thoughts on paper. It might look stupid to other people when I'm reading off something I wrote, but honestly that's much better than the alternative.

Confrontation is super duper hard, I know, but as much as I loathe admitting it, it is necessary sometimes. As much as we value listening to other people's beliefs and opinions, ours also deserve to be heard, even something as small as telling a sibling to please ask before borrowing a phone charger or something. But unfortunately, we have to practice it, it's not a feeling that sits comfortably in our bones. Do some self searching and look for the snags in your confrontations and see how you personally can work around them (like my writing down what I wana say)

And then an add on to that practice would be getting comfortable with the outcome of the conflict and not lingering on it like it was all your fault. I'm sorry I have no advice there, I'm still terrible at that 😅 but I believe that by continuing on with my journey like this, once I do the actual confrontation better, I'll become better at dealing with the aftermath. Start small, start at the beginning..."

Enneagram,fphkqc6,t1_fpge6he,1588622993.0,"Haha ahh gotta love these communities, somehow the ""I'm not the only freak who is like this!"" feeling makes us feel less alone. And also totally my mom is a control freak, and has a tendency to give me a ""wtf"" look when I talk about/mention anything she would possibly consider outside her realm of reality or values so maybe it's a defense mechanism haha

Something you mentioned actually made me realise that, although I absolutely hate debates (because it might make me say something someone would disagree with and that might destroy my hopes and dreams of harmony) I don't necessarily mind having these types of discussions with some of my friends because we're all varsity educated and thinkers (I'm a feeler hiding in a thinker's body) and we have open discussions and don't mind being faced with a contrary opinion from someone who has done some research, and it's always amicable so my peace isn't always disturbed. But it's not the same with parents... They're the Facebook news, conspiracy theory generation.

But on a more serious note, maybe the apparent aggression we tone towards for example family still is connected to trying to maintain peace in our environment, because it hurts more disappointing or angering family than friends (if you have a good relationship with family, that is). We can create and maintain this peace by being in control of what happens in this environment and having everyone act in a way that we feel would maintain harmony. So what do we do? We control, and when we can't control peacefully, we demand, sometimes in anger, that their opinions and viewpoints align with our own so that we are on the same page and everyone can agree and all is right with the world again. Whereas with friends we may choose to just defer to their judgement for the sake of harmony...

I think in that way your interpretation of the balanced wings is something I can agree with. Maybe people like us just don't have a dominant wing always, but alternate between the two depending on the impending risk to our inner peace and environmental harmony 😂🙈"
Enneagram,fpgajf5,t1_fpfvx3i,1588598538.0,"I apologise in advance for the long response haha

Well firstly, where you said your family thinks you're angry when you talk, especially in a debate, that's totally me. Not that I really get into debates, they're the bane of my existence. But I have noticed I get aggressive. After delving into my INFP info (long before enneagram) I thought maybe it's partly because I'm trying to protect my values or internal moral compass, combine that with the fact that I'm being asked to deliver an opinion on stuff I don't wana think about in a space I feel under pressure (for absolutely no reason... It's all in my head) and I come as aggressive to shut it down.

Looking at things through the enneagram 9 perspective, it gave me a bit more clarity in that I do tend to sound angry, and that's partly because, as a 9 I don't like to talk about personal things and opinions or be involved in conflict so I let everything bottle up inside and pretend it's all good and fine but on the inside it's all pent up anger because I actually do have strong opinions and I DON'T AGREE WITH THIS but I'll never say it out loud. And in comes passive aggression 😅

My parents have always thought I'm quite angry, and my mom often says to me ""why are you so mean to me?"" when I don't think I'm being mean, but I see what she means. But what I've never been able to understand is why I'm more aggressive and confrontational in conversation with for example my parents and SO, but not my friends.

My friends describe me also as a comforting presence, non judgemental, peaceful and loving and encouraging which is such a contrast to how I feel my family sees me, and I wouldn't say my relationship with anyone in my family is bad, I have a good family, no traumatising experiences to cause any of it. So, am I a 9w1 with friends and a 9w8 with people closest to me? Is it coincidence or is there more to it? I'd love to understand because I don't like that the people closest to me perceive me like that, it makes me unapproachable.

Also, I'm just absolutely a dreamer. Big, big, disappear into my head, unrealistic expectations dreamer"

Point is, don't let those people make you feel undervalued, especially not in such a discriminatory way. Every single human being has traits about themselves they don't like, and if the people around you aren't either helping you grow, encouraging you to grow or just being there in your seasons of zero growth then they're not worth keeping around or measuring yourself against. Every person has so much value, and the right friends and people will see and appreciate yours and draw it out of you.

NoStupidQuestions,fow3ww0,t3_g9nlna,1588112547.0,"When I was an undergraduate student (not in the US) I lived in a res/dorm and shared a single room. First roommate in first year was an absolute nut job, wore my clothing (because she never washed hers) and never ever washed her dishes. I found her wearing my underwear and that was it - got her kicked out of my room.

My second roommate was an absolute dream. I think the key with her, and any good roommate, is respect for one another and ultimately similar values. We both valued the same level of space and human interaction, she'd make me tea without wanting to chat, I'd wash some of her dishes if I'm washing some of my own, we woke each other up if we were gonna be late for class, and we never had parties in the room unless it was discussed beforehand. It really could work out so well, if it is a good match.

Also, no overnight guests are allowed in female residences here so we never had a ""sock on the door"" problem... 

tl;dr: from my experience, I think it'll only work if the two sharing have respect for one another and a similar set of values. Ultimately I think that can navigate any issue living in close quarters."

Tried listening to what they were saying because they looked concerned, and all I heard was ""he has a knife"" and ""he went that way"". My backdoor and gate were wide open (because I live in a generally very safe security complex) so my heart nearly jumped out of my chest as I walked through the living room to lock up. Just as I locked up, there was a loud bang on my front door, and I swallowedy heart back into my stomach. 

I grabbed a chopping knife out of the kitchen drawer and asked who's there, turns out it's my neighbour coming to check on me. I opened up and she explained that another resident in the complex is apparently a massive drug addict and he was high on tik (a very cheap and very addictive drug here) and robbing people in the complex, literally pulling their sliding doors off their hinges.

india,etnvkns,t1_etlsz2m,1563001911.0,"I'm not from India, but I've visited there and have some very good family friends there. My only questions are, so the world knows the caste system has been officially abolished, why do people still hold onto it so tightly? Do you see a change in the younger generations/do they observe difference in caste less than the older generations? Is it a change in society you expect will happen or do you think caste segregation is a problem that is there to stay?

I went to my friend's wedding in Amritsar 2 years ago, he married below his caste, he kept her secret from the family for years. She had to pay a lot to marry him eventually. I asked him about the whole caste situation, hadn't it been abolished? He couldn't answer me"

chemistry,erq2pak,t1_erpjm98,1561133823.0,"I see why you might think that, but there have been some recent developements in crystal growth where crystals of a material are grown inside a gel. These gels have been shown to allow these crystals (which wouldn't normally even grow under standard crystallisation conditions) to grow as beautiful pristine single crystals. Rather than having thousands of nucleation sites, resulting in a lot of very tiny crystals, crystals growing in these gels grow larger and there are less of them. They're better quality. When I saw this initially my thoughts went to those studies, maybe the play doh is acting in a similar way to the gels, allowing the salt to crystallise in this unique way"
