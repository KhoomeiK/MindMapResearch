gaidhlig,fabiwr4,t1_fabii40,1575923917.0,"Yeah thats not what I was meaning haha I didnâ€™t want tutoring, more just someone to have conversation with in GÃ idhlig! Thank you though!"
gaidhlig,fabifh6,t1_fabhcrh,1575923711.0,Can you just chat to them or are you saying youâ€™d be paying for one on one tutoring?
gaidhlig,fabibf5,t1_fabe81y,1575923663.0,"Thanks for the suggestions. I live nowhere near any of those places hah, but i appreciate it. I know there is a local group but I was hoping to just message someone online rather than meet in person at this stage."

gaidhlig,f4q0l8j,t3_dkzvol,1571746059.0,"I had an Irish friend that said it was mandatory for them to take Irish in school until I think about age 14ish. If it was perhaps introduced as a regular part of the learning curriculum in Scottish schools so that children are learning from a young age, I think that could bring a bit of a revival."

Fibromyalgia,f0urpmu,t1_f0upbyc,1568948778.0,"Yeah i have trouble at work because my brain is trying to remember all 50 things that Iâ€™m trying to multitask but I canâ€™t seem to focus on only one of them and then I keep jumping back and forth and then I forget half of what I was doing and when I try to remember what the first half was, I forget the other half.
Fog for me is when I just like, forget the word for shoes even though I know the word and Iâ€™ve known the word since I was like 6 months old but still canâ€™t remember the word and have to just point at my feet until someone else says the word for me."
Fibromyalgia,f0urhzy,t1_f0tc55p,1568948600.0,Thanks for your response! I love hockey too so I understand being focused on that haha!
Fibromyalgia,f0urgah,t1_f0ta5ag,1568948560.0,"Thank you so much for this response, this is super helpful! I actually might have bipolar ii or major depressive, weâ€™re not 100% sure right now as the psychiatrist doesnâ€™t want to slap a label on me. Which I can understand, but it also infuriates me because I feel like labels help me piece together whatâ€™s going on in my head. So for right now, itâ€™s general mood disorder, and general anxiety i think. With ptsd. Fml ðŸ™ƒ
I think I also get nervous because it took me so long to get my fibro diagnoses and before that, no one took me seriously. So it stresses me out to not have an official mental diagnosis too, if that makes sense. 
I see the doc next Wednesday though so Iâ€™m going to talk to her then to see what she thinks."
