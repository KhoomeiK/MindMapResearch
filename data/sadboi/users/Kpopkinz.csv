9ucci bank- bewhy is a rapper and this is a khiphop song but has a lot of bass 


Hit me- mobb was when bobby and mino collabed


Full house- mobb as well this has more of a significant bass


How‚Äôs this- hyuna i love this song don‚Äôt see alot of people mention it


Thank u sooo much- yubin has more of a lighter softer bass so its not super hard like stray kids or nct 


Punk right now- hyo, its hyoyeon from snsd she became a edm artist pretty much all her songs have bass


What are you waiting for- anda, i honestly really love this song it made me appreciated anda more as an artist


Tmi- hot place this was by a extremely underrated kpop song but it gives retro club vibes and is super fast based with bass which is the type of bass i like the most in kpop songs


Oopsie my bad- nature youll hear most the bass in the chorus 


Roomshaker- ailee this was one of the most recent songs she mad has a strong edm influence 


Do or die- AleXa i started stanning her during her time in produce 48


Enchanted propaganda- jvcki wai not super intense bass but its one of my favorite khiphop songs


Legacy by dpr live as well as please by dpr live these songs have very intense bass i love dpr live i wish it got more attention alot of his songs have alot of bass
