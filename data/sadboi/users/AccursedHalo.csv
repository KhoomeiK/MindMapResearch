Like, we are getting along now but I might not feel any connection with you at all once we meet.

Bugs the hell out of me. So I just stop talking to them. They know what they did. And if they try and hit me back up, I tell them ""listen I'm no longer interested in you anymore bc xyz"", and leave it at that. Recently I've been met with an apology and an okay, but a lot of the times I get that ""you're just a fucking prude"", ""ya right I bet you sleep with people on the first date"", ""didn't want to fuck you anyways because you're an ugly slut"" and whatever else they can come up with.

I'm good with kids and I like children who behave, but taking care of them even if it's just babysitting takes it toll on me if I'm with them and caring for them every day for extended hours at a time.

Example: I was babysitting one time and I was there from 6am to 12am. I felt trapped and severely depressed, next day it happened again and I felt like I couldn't breathe.

Unless you have solid proof of it actually happening. Or if it's a sliding scale hospital but, I've never heard of a sliding scale hospital and you're still gonna pay a shit ton just in payments."
NarcissisticAbuse,f7g7dvr,t3_dvwwr4,1573696455.0,"I use that on my narcissistic mother who says ""nobody loves me"" and all of her other playing victim fanatics. Because I have no other way to respond bc everything I say makes it worse. So now I just use it if I come across another abusive ass fuck. Such as my ex who said he'd kill himself and blame it on me if I left him. So.

If the abuser says that to you. Run."

EntitledPeople,f7f1jye,t3_dvp7c9,1573670417.0,"Omg. She just broke so many procedures. And... just.. uuuuhhh. She got fired, I guarantee you.

One, you treat patients with respect, secondly you don't question the doctor unless its actually something to be wrong, you take that up with the doctor in private and document everything, three. If a patient says they might have xyz or you suspect a patient to be contagious you isolate them and clean everything after they leave thoroughly but you don't announce it to the whole building. That can cause so many other problems. She was out of line there in so many ways. Where was this? Like country/state? If you don't mind me asking."

Not only is embarrassing for the rejected but embarrassing for whoever is being asked."
