A co worker of mine does this and I realized long ago how much I loathe that behavior. Own up to your damn mistakes! Blaming others or pulling out excuses just makes you look worse, imo. I respect people who own up, say sorry if need be and fix the problem without pointing fingers.

Look how far scientists have come in a mere two months finding treatments for this disease. The Spanish flu was 100 years ago! If there is a second wave, it will be handled better and not catch us by surprise like this round did.

Arkansas,fp0rxuf,t1_fp0lwxx,1588215583.0,"Ok so when do you think we should begin easing restrictions and opening back up? August? September? 2021?

It makes zero sense to keep hold on restrictions for months longer because if ‚Äúwe are going to have a spike in cases‚Äù then it will happen regardless if we open in August, September, or 2021. We have to ease into opening or we will never be able to again. 

Parents have to work. Maybe you‚Äôre one of the lucky ones who has deep pockets or are drawing unemployment getting more than what your normal paycheck would be but unfortunately that‚Äôs not the case for everyone. People have to work. 

For the record I personally don‚Äôt agree with opening this early but I do agree with HOW they are wanting to ease into opening. 

Keep in mind that deaths are being recorded as covid even if they did not pass FROM covid."
Arkansas,fp0k8mi,t1_fp0h0r7,1588210939.0,"I disagree again. Gradually opening things back up with precautions and not at full capacities will help keep the curve flattened (which by the way is completely flattened) by less people=less exposure, versus if we was to open the flood gates entirely. Our economy and keeping food on your families table depends on this. 

The majority of people don‚Äôt want the state to reopen so they‚Äôre choosing to stay home willingly (without any influence of our Gov.) which also helps to keep the curve flattened. 

Keep lockdowns ongoing (we‚Äôre talking months) are going to eventually lower immunity because you‚Äôre not allowing yourself to be exposed to anything at all, which builds your immunity whether you realize that or not, so when everyone comes back out all at once (think school starting) it‚Äôs going to be illness overload again and you can add covid on top of that."

AskReddit,foyohpr,t3_ga4gjx,1588176230.0,"I have one. When I was about 18 I was staying at a friends house for a few days. She still lived with her parents and had a pretty nice house with nothing that would give off creepy vibes. One night we was in her room, she was already asleep and I was laying in bed (her bed was parallel to her closet) still awake probably mindlessly browsing on my phone (circa 2011) when suddenly I heard music faintly playing in the next room. It sounded like jazz. Not thinking much of it since her dad had a small tv in the kitchen that he kept on, I chalked it up to that. The music kept tuning in and out. Curiosity got the best of me and since I couldn‚Äôt sleep anyway, I got up and went in their kitchen. No tv was on, no music was playing. I got a little creeped out but after a little while I went back to sleep and that was it. 

A couple nights later I‚Äôm back in my friends room, almost asleep when suddenly this super loud crash, inches from my face, jolts me awake. I instantly shot up out of bed to investigate. She had a large toy house she kept on the top shelf of her closet that was previously her older brother‚Äôs who had passed years before in a car accident. The toy house somehow flung itself off the shelf to come crash onto the nightstand right next to where my face was! One side of the house was dented in from where it fell but nothing that couldn‚Äôt be fixed. 

Needless to say I didn‚Äôt stay the night anymore and my friend never heard anything that night. I have no explanation of how it could have happened. The top shelf of the closet was several feet from the night stand."

The whole point of the shelter in place order (globally not just AR) was to flatten the curve so the hospitals would not get over ran. Guess what is not over ran and some even closing because of non activity? Hospitals. Somehow in the mix, I feel that people have turned this into ‚Äúwe must stay home to totally eradicate the virus or at least not come out until it is totally under control!‚Äù No. That‚Äôs not it because realistically, that‚Äôs impossible and if it were the case, we would never get to leave. I think a slow, gradual reintroduction to open back is the best option. Why people don‚Äôt agree with this, I don‚Äôt understand but if you‚Äôre not comfortable with going back out and you‚Äôre fortunate enough to be working remotely, stay home as long as you wish.

I‚Äôd also like to add that people who are passing from other diseases or circumstances are being reported as covid deaths even if they did not have covid. Also, there‚Äôs a difference between dying with covid and dying from covid."
