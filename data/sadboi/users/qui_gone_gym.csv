Brain fog is gone. Things in my life are still not perfect and I still got a lot to do, but it got much better overall. I had to accept some bitter facts - like inability to build healthy relationships and some unpleasant traits of my personality, but now I can think of positive future again, now more realistic.

With time I've started to take it as a natural path of personal development. All of us have different starter positions - different families, different financial status and different abilities. Anyways, all that defines you until the moment you realize that something goes wrong. After that moment it's up to you who you are. So, there's nothing to blame yourself for if you've passed some life trial in a wrong way - because you was not prepared to pass it in a right way yet. It's only important to learn the lesson and make better the next time.

That's my ultimate rule of self-acceptance. Some mistakes still hurt a lot, but it helps and inspires me, hope it helps you too. 

Stay strong, keep moving and one day you'll be at the point you want to be, proud of yourself."

socialskills,f9jnpdf,t3_e5ging,1575380870.0,"I'm happy for you, but there's some more I got to say. ""Friends"" who make fun of you are not your friends. They just use you for having fun, so do you, if to be honest. If they won't continue lowering your self esteem, they will not raise it, and that's the opposite to what true friends should do. Friendship is about supporting and accepting each other, so you'd better find better ones. But, at first, you should become a friend to yourself. Learn yourself, your strengths and weaknesses, find something you respect yourself for, then the true friends will come to your life, trust me. I'd recommend you to find some kind of psychologist and talk to one, talk about your problems with self esteem, that will shorten your way. 

Just saying that because I regret about not doing it earlier myself. 

Best wishes!"

Go for your dream, you're lucky you have one! Do what makes you happy, and be yourself. It's your father, who owes you, not contrariwise."

He's a good person, anyways, very hardworking, and taught me a lot of other things like how to fix things, but I can remember very few of the ones, that could be useful for making life decisions, unfortunately."
