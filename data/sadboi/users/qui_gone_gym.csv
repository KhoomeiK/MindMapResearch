At the lowest point I found myself aimlessly staring at the wall, thinking about becoming a monk at the monastery to give my life at least some meaning, but now it’s all gone. My memory is back. Brain fog is gone. Things in my life are still not perfect and I still got a lot to do, but it got much better overall. I had to accept some bitter facts - like inability to build healthy relationships and some unpleasant traits of my personality, but now I can think of positive future again, now more realistic. Amount of books unread, movies unwatched, places unexplored amazes me again. That’s how it feels  and I believe every depressed person can achieve that."

With time I've started to take it as a natural path of personal development. All of us have different starter positions - different families, different financial status and different abilities. Anyways, all that defines you until the moment you realize that something goes wrong. After that moment it's up to you who you are. So, there's nothing to blame yourself for if you've passed some life trial in a wrong way - because you was not prepared to pass it in a right way yet. It's only important to learn the lesson and make better the next time.

That's my ultimate rule of self-acceptance. Some mistakes still hurt a lot, but it helps and inspires me, hope it helps you too. 

Stay strong, keep moving and one day you'll be at the point you want to be, proud of yourself."

Friendship is about supporting and accepting each other, so you'd better find better ones. But, at first, you should become a friend to yourself. Learn yourself, your strengths and weaknesses, find something you respect yourself for, then the true friends will come to your life, trust me.
