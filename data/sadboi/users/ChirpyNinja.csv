Sometimes we land up with the worst parents in the world. I don’t know if they understand how destructive and hurtful they’re being, or if like others have commented, they are true narcissists who thrive off putting other people down. 

People like them use humiliation as their weapon, and it’s a surprisingly effective one. The best defense against it is to recognize it and understand that she’s actively using it to try and hurt you. It still doesn’t take all the sting away but some part of your rational brain cushions you from the attack. she must have some very deep demons of her own that have nothing to do with you.

Please know that no matter what, you are so much better and stronger and smarter than your mother. And one day you are going to have a beautiful little girl and do so much better for her than what your (patheticly bitchy) mother did for you. You’re going to be the one to break this cycle and come out of it the stronger person. And your some-day-in-the-future-little-girl is going to be the luckiest person for that.

In the mean time please continue to look after your mental health. It takes such bravery and courage for us to do this in the face of all the stigma associated with depression, and an extraordinary greater amount of awesomeness to do it with a family that is actively sabotaging you at every point.

Finally, I’m just recently coming to understand my own depression in the face of a hostile and ridiculing family. I’ve found that Andrew Solomon’s book, the noonday demon, is helping me understand so many things in much clearer detail than any psychiatrist had been able to explain to me so far. If you enjoy reading then I would definitely recommend it as an enlightening and inspiring read.

Thank you for sharing your story and for reminding me that we’re not alone in these experiences. 

Sending you tonnes of love and admiration for your bravery and grit!!"
