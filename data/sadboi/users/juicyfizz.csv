Directly from the CDC website:](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html) ""It’s unclear if those antibodies can provide protection (immunity) against getting infected again. This means that we do not know at this time if antibodies make you immune to the virus."""
Columbus,fr5xn78,t1_fr5skri,1589916378.0,We actually won't see those numbers of positive results from reeopening for another month. Between the incubation period and the fact that you aren't incredibly sick right from the start of the infection means people who think they have it won't be getting tested until like ~7 days into their virus. We're only 19 days into May.
Columbus,fr5xe0j,t1_fr5tto4,1589916258.0,"> Oh so the rate of infections isn't decreasing?

It's not. The data is out there on the department of health website for you to analyze at any time and see for yourself. It's updated daily. Number of infections are not going down.

Do you have a relationship with your dad at all?"
AskWomenOver30,fr4xgqz,t1_fr4ncjg,1589898722.0,"> It has nothing to do with you. It has all to do with her.

Exactly. It's the hardest thing ever to accept, but it's 100% true."
AskWomenOver30,fr4w8at,t3_gmkior,1589898057.0,"I would bring it up to her, honestly. But let that be your final ""olive branch"" or whatever. You can't be the only one initiating things. No relationship is way better than a one-way relationship. The no relationship wound eventually heals, but the one-way relationship wounds over and over.

It stings a lot to have a mother that can't really be bothered with you, especially since you went from one extreme to another. That perceived rejection is a tough pill to swallow, I totally can relate.

My situation is sort of the opposite of yours. I grew up with a mother who couldn't really be bothered. She took care of my physical needs of course, but there was never really any connection emotionally. Talking to her about something, it seemed like it didn't even really permeate her brain. Just nods and ""mmhmm"". She couldn't tell you the names of most of my friends, or what my major was in college. My childhood best friend's mother was the total opposite, so I sought solace there. At times my mother seemed to get her shit together but by that time, I didn't really want shit to do with her. And I think she only seemed to get her own shit together due to jealousy. The loss of the relationship of my childhood best friend about 5-6 years ago, and subsequently, her mother, stung way more than anything with my own mother. 

These days I have a tenuous relationship with my mother. She's a very involved grandma (I have two boys), but it took years of therapy to understand she is emotionally unintelligent and she's very selfish. No matter what it is, her focal point is how it affects her. My little sister was diagnosed with breast cancer 2 years ago at age 25, and I was not able to grieve or process what was happening emotionally, because I was busy supporting my sister and keeping my mother's meltdowns over it away from my sister so she could focus on her recovery. I'm still angry about it. (My sister is in remission and doing great, thankfully.)

She leaned on me a lot emotionally when I was younger (middle school/high school) during her divorce from my father, which looking back was inappropriate. I had to re-learn boundaries in therapy. 

Eventually, it has just become something I accept. I keep in contact with her only because of my children. She doesn't know this because it's simply not worth the conversation.

I believe in your case, it's at least worth the conversation. If it doesn't go where you want or need it, then there is absolutely zero issue with walking away. I think we get caught up in family relationships because we're related to them, but at the end of the day, if that relationship doesn't serve you, boost you up, and/or contribute to your life in some positive way, then it's not for you. You get to choose who is in your life. Surround yourself with friends and people who spark joy in your life, not deplete your joy.

And if you can get therapy, I 100% recommend it. I'd still be in a similar cycle as you had I not sought it."

HappyTrees,fnq2lvk,t1_fnpzxxm,1587156497.0,"Thank you! It was my second stab at a seascape, my first one being Kevin's beginner #2. I'm gonna have to try one of Bob's now, haha. And thank you. The sand part was a struggle because I'd gotten too much paint on the canvas and it was hard to navigate after that."
