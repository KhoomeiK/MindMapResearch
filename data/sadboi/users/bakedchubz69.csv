unpopularopinion,fistmp4,t1_fissg26,1582693012.0,"Alright, you got me. 

I get where you are coming from. My perspective has admittedly changed a bit following this conversation. Your arguments are consistent with your belief that the government should have no control over ones body. Other’s may be different. 

I still think not wearing your seatbelt should be illegal though. Due to the sheer fact that making it illegal increases awareness and keeps people safe. Seatbelts dramatically increase your chance of surviving (by 50%) a car wreck as I’m sure you know. 

Congrats, you have successfully made someone somewhat, kind of sort of, change their mind on a subject. 
If I come up with a counter argument I will be spilling though. I hate the feeling of thinking of something after the conversation is over which is a feeling I am sure everyone has felt. 

Good job. no, really."
unpopularopinion,fiss7mw,t1_fisr1ll,1582691899.0,"But isn’t it? Why do you think people aren’t allowed gun ownership before a certain age? People are preventing illegal actions by making things illegal. 
The whole car situation was hypothetical and I admit in hissing he wasn’t the best argument. But I can try to find an example of seatbelts protecting others safety. 

I didn’t want to use this example because I felt like this was not the best backup but what about the whole committing suicide illegally thing? Yeah I know, I know, it doesn’t do much but it is still a law regardless. It tries to protect people from themselves and potentially others depending on how you look at the situation. 
It must be reported by a therapist or teacher if someone is suicidal as well. Protecting the person who is out to hurt themselves. Should this all just be erased from the law book because it’s “their choice?”"

eating_disorders,evx11pa,t1_evwzf0o,1564878879.0,Well it’s not that I want to be bulimic I just wish I could throw up my food so I could avoid calories. Sometimes I just contemplate if I should throw up my meals or not after I eat them. (Usually if I feel rlly full or bloated.) Also I would say i often don’t reach 2000 calories a day. I said I used to estimate each food item I ate and add 200 calories to each one so that I was surely under 2000 calories a day. Nowadays I feel like I’m overeating but maybe not and I’m overreacting. But now I try to eat as little as possible throughout the day (although it doesn’t often workout) my parents will bring home something to eat and I’ll eat that and feel like crap. When I get back to school I’m prob gonna follow my usual routine and not eat anything for breakfast or lunch and eat dinner or close to that. The fainting spells used to happen a lot more. (They still happen sometimes) prob bc I eat more. Sometimes when they happen I get confused because I feel like I ate an adequate amount that day. When I ate less I had  a fainting spell about 1-2 Times a month. Now not as much.
