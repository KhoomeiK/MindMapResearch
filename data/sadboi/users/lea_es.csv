But i dont believe this is an accurate test, if you are really concerned u better check with someone professional. Not to make you feel bad about yourself but narcissism is a serious problem, specially if you are a parent (from my own experience at least, i dislike many aspects of my dad cuz he is a real narcissist & manipulator). BUT i think it is so good and important that you already (maybe) recognize that within yourself and you seem to be willing to change so that says something! And it is actually possible to change, it all about your way of thinking, once you recognize your flaws, u can work on them. 
From my experience with narcissistic people, you may actually be nice on the inside and really emotional but your narcissism may make you come off wrong to people around you, without you even noticing that."

depression,flg0pdr,t3_fof8yd,1585125585.0,"HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! 🎂❤️
If people dont like you it is THEIR problem ok?!! Each of us is unique in his own way and thats what makes the world an interesting place. 
I literally hated my life between the age of 13-17! Teenage years could be shitty & challenging, you wanna be an adult but you are still getting to know yourself & developing your personality, so it is absolutely normal to make mistakes/ say stupid stuff etc.....
At the age of 16 i was living in a similar situation to yours, i had no friends at all in school, me and another girl always stuck together but we never really got along tho, was only cuz we were both “bullied” by others, other kids thought we are weird and were just too prejudiced about us. 

I was at the peak of my depression but i never allowed myself to think that something is wrong with me! Cuz inside i always knew that i just have a different personality to the teens around me in this specific school but i knew that im a nice person and that many other teens out there would wanna be frieds with me! The next year when i started highschool, i became friends with literally everyone in my class! And we get along till this day, (im 19 rn) so indeed nothing was wrong with me. 

Never try to change & make yourself uncomfortable in order to fit in 💛
You are unique but u just happen to be in the wrong place/environment at the moment. 
So what, let them think you are weird (HATE that word)
I like most people out there, tend to believe myself to be such a weird person too, but it is because of “my weirdness” and the way I’m that people wanna get to know me. My weirdness completes me & makes me the unique person I’m. 

Hope you got my point here! And hang in there, good days are on the way I PROMISE!!! I regret all the times i went around feeling sorry for myself for not having “friends”. Indeed the summers i spent in my bedroom were one of the best, i got to know myself better."

Music is great! I play it all the time whenever im home alone etc....

What have worked best for me is going out for long walks in the city (2-3h) with no headphones, it helps clear my mind & focus on my surrounding more rather than being “trapped” in my own head.

Surprisingly journaling helps too! I try to journal each now and then, i just write down any thoughts that have been circulating in my brain and i try to reflect on them etc, writing down stuff actually kinda clears the brain out, no matter how random/nonsense they are!"

Life is more simple than what our brain thinks. Not easy, not supposed to be easy, life cant be a straight line, not for anyone, everyone will have bad times at some point, some are worse than others yes, but life is all about challenges u know!

I usually take the train by myself, no headphones - just to force myself to observe and pay attention to my surrounding, since it is very difficult to focus and be mentally present when one is anxious / depressed. So i go off in random/new stations, i just walk around and explore - makes me feel very good, reflect on my thoughts, get to know myself better......

AnxietyDepression,fjuyiud,t3_feylym,1583621479.0,"Hey there thanks for sharing! Just know that you are not alone in this, I personally have struggled w depression & anxiety attacks (latest was yesterday) for at least 4 years now.......

I have never been to therapy for many reasons, part of me believes it wouldn’t help, im afraid of taking any kind of meds that could affect how my brain functions, but mostly due to financial reasons too. 

Just like you, i was also stuck in this “cant leave home” cycle, (my record is 3 weeks straight lol) but in my case i struggle with insomnia as a side effect of all the anxiety.

Here are a couple of stuff other than therapy that help me through this, although the affect may be slow and may not be so long lasting but i try


1- spending more time with my self, i sometimes force myself to go to the city with no headphones, just walk around or chill somewhere
While i do that, i get time to “zone out” & just reflect over my thoughts, i try to clear my mind.

2- journaling, whether on paper or on my phone/computer, has been helpful for me, being able to write & read your thoughts, kinda helps your brain “sort it away”

3- venting! You probably already know how relieving & comforting this could be. At least for me, opening up to someone and talking about my emotions has never been easy, i can NEVER open up to someone from my family, but i have finally found someone whom im really comfortable opening up to and even though they cant do anything about the situation, only the fact that they are there and listening is helpful enough. So try finding that person who you can tell ANYTHING. 

4- Praying 🙌🏼
This is what mostly keeps me going tbh, although it is hard to stay consistent w it, but because im constantly overthinking stuff, praying helps my brain calm down, it gives me an energy boost.


I will soon be going to therapy for the first time though, trying to stay positive towards it.
