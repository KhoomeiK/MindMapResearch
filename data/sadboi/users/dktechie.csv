FanFiction,fg4ifmk,t3_ewqv0r,1580503895.0,"Most writers say they want feedback but mean feedback on certain parts - Is this story clear? Can you understand what's going on? Does the storyline flow? Do I know how to craft a sentence? Do you think I need ESL?

So when readers respond, they don't seem prepared because readers don't give feedback on the parts the writer want and can't because they can't read a writer's mind. The writer has to be more specific about what he or she wants in the feedback. Don't just say you want feedback on the story and think the reader knows what to do.

And if the reader points out stuff you missed and you don't feel right about it, ask the reader why. If they explain with examples from your work, test getting feedback with other readers and see if they point to the same problem. If they do, then you can look at it. If they don't, then don't accept the feedback. I use this to test readers with the harshest criticism. I ask them if they can point out where they felt the story lagged. If they have no explanation in five minutes, then I tune them out. 

You also don't have to accept all feedback or validate your story. It's good to keep your voice intact in your story. There are many great books that collect dust on the bookshelves, and many not so great books selling each second. Sometimes feedback is subjective - it's all about how one person relates to your story and sees it."

writing,exo976v,t3_ctsizm,1566472278.0,I'm experiencing that now. What is helping me is coming up with an estimated wordcount and dividing it among any plot template that is good for the story.
writing,ew7lmd9,t3_cn3jps,1565193667.0,"I use references and I don't plot until I finish my first draft. 

My references are old writing and notes (social media events, news, observation, etc). I use a notepad to write down things that catch my attention. 

For a non action story, I only know what happens in the beginning.

For an action story, I know what happens in the beginning and should have an idea of the end. Because my mind wanders, I list a few mid points.

**This is good only if:**

-  I don't write the story in order. It prevents boredom. I don't get stuck because it's easy to think up my old stash or a new idea. If I can't find something in my reference materials, I usually Google a scenario (idea of what I think needs to. happen) and see something like a news article that helps me with writing.

- I have a deadline or an idea of when I want to end the story. Sometimes I just tell myself if I reach X amount of words I should be done. 

- I always know what to write in my next session.

- I handwrite more now. This way I can write everywhere. With typing, I can waste time going back to edit some parts. With handwriting, I just keep moving.

.

The reason why I don't plot is because it's like the story that comes out when I write doesn't give a damn about my plotting notes. 

So now I just make a reference for a story. If I come up with new characters, update stuff or make a new location as I write the first draft, I write it down there.

When I finish the first draft of the story, I use the reference to make character profiles, events and all the other stuff for the story, but I don't overdo it. It's just for guiding me in the editing process.

.

I'm not published. I got posted in a blog once lol. But I have a bunch of material spread out everywhere so I do write regularly. Google gave me more extra cloud space to use because I was piling up lol.  I also use Dropbox and have other way other ways to store my files. Hope this helps.

EDIT -

**I just reread. Sorry about that. You're doing the same thing I did before I organized lol. Putting the scenes on a timeline can help you get started. I do this in the beginning of plotting.**"

relationships,ev8mizj,t3_cihkqv,1564284151.0,"One thing I learned is never try to fix someone. Let them drown if they need to drown because you're not a doctor.

My brother was all over this girl who did nothing for him. He helped with her career and school but she did not give a damn. Despite her bad personality, this boy still wanted to be with her. I used that example to break it off with my ex who was exactly like your bf because I realised if a girl like my brother's gf could still keep a man, then what the fuck was I doing? 

No matter what you do - a guy will leave if he already set his mind up to leave. You could be pretty or ugly, good or bad, rich or poor, married or not married - if a guy wants to leave, he will leave. 

So if you break it off, good for you. But if you still want to be with your bf, do so. But you need to start mentally preparing. 

Start focusing more on looking good, improving your finances, boosting your career or any other thing that makes you feel confident in yourself and unafraid to let him go. If he gets depressed, you will find yourself telling him to go to a therapist. 

You are not doing this because you want him to stay and you're playing hard to get. No, you're doing this because when he leaves, someone else will replace him - and you won't need to find that person, that person will find you.

My family friend had a husband who was terrible to her. Her husband would gossip about her to his best friend. When the guy divorced his wife, his own best friend immedietely started contacting her. Years later, they are still a couple and he's rich. There is someone better out there for you, so start getting ready to meet that person because your bf is already hunting."
