I found it has to do with three things: grind, pack, and flower quality.

I was initially grinding medium/course, but then got a different grinder with a fine plate and it makes a big difference, I get more hits and the flower is more evenly browned. 

I was initially packing with just a scoop, but then started using the orange filling tool and it blew me away how much better it is to use that. It keeps you from spilling weed everywhere and then you can use the orange tool to pack it down a little and that works perfectly for me. I fill it so the weed is a little past the metal bowl, just sitting on the ceramic part. 

Flower quality absolutely makes a difference. My old, dry weed only gives me a few wispy hits. My new, fresh weed gives me maybe 8-10 big hits. 

Keep experimenting, hopefully you will come to love it like I love my Mighty now!"

1. If you aren’t using one get a torch. I tried using mine with a bic lighter and it was horrible and I combusted many times or didn’t get any hits. You need a torch for this thing, or an induction heater.

2. Heat more toward the base not the tip. The material in the tip will vape much quicker than the base so you want to heat the middle and end more. 

3. The first hit won’t produce much of anything other than some terpy hot air. For the first hit I recommend covering the hole completely. For the next hits, hit it with the hole completely open and suck hard. This should give you pretty big clouds for the second and third hit. It’s completely done by hit 4 or 5."

vaporents,fk4gqvk,t3_fg2vyx,1583860127.0,"I’ll try and sum it up for you easy:

There are 2 types of vapes: cartridge vapes that contain THC oil and flower vapes where you use ground up weed in the vape.

The oil carts are the ones everyone was in an uproar about and that was causing all the illnesses. Flower vapes are completely different and have not caused these vape illness you have been hearing about. 

All the vapes you listed are fine, no reason to worry. 

But that said, anything you inhale into your lungs other than air isn’t good for you, but flower vaping is considered the safest alternative to combustion other than edibles. Combustion will create all kinds of carcinogens that you inhale. Flower vaping doesn’t create as my carcinogens so it’s deemed safer, but we don’t really have enough scientific studies on the matter to know for sure how much safer they are. But it’s definitely better than smoking a pipe or joint or bong."

They can also grow for you but they can’t sell you what they grow, they have to just give it to you. I’d assume the same with concentrates, allowed to make them for you but not sell them to you. 

Caregivers in MA work nothing like caregivers in Maine, who are actually allowed to set up storefronts and do deliveries to anyone with a med card and don’t have to just be assigned to one person.

Refer to section 501.025 1(a) with states: “A personal caregiver may not sell or otherwise divert marijuana that has been dispensed to or cultivated on behalf of a registered qualifying patient”"
craftymighty,fhhcf73,t1_fhhb3b2,1581600717.0,Oh I thought that was your picture and you were trying to get other’s opinions on how they liked it. My bad.
craftymighty,fhhb27m,t3_f36jh1,1581599665.0,Where did you get it from?
vaporents,fhe4spn,t1_fhe2nyd,1581513695.0,"Well for background I’ve been using marijuana for 10 years now. I’ve been vaping it for about a year and a half, before I would smoke bowls and joints. 

I wouldn’t call myself a heavy user really compared to others. I only use at night on weekdays after work, and I have 2 ovens in my Mighty. On weekends I have 1-2 ovens in the morning/afternoon then my usual 2 at night, or 1 at night plus some concentrates."
vaporents,fhdwsl0,t3_f2ike5,1581505560.0,I don’t really see the point in T breaks. For me personally my tolerance goes down but not drastically and once I start vaping again I go back to my usual tolerance within a day or two.  This is after a two week break. So I never do them unless I get sick with a cold or something.
bostontrees,fhdum8t,t1_fhd8um7,1581502487.0,"Agree the Maine Diner used to be better but they are still good. Totally forgot about Congdons! I actually prefer their breakfast over the Maine Diner now, and you’re right their donuts are awesome!"
vaporents,fhcp9uy,t3_f2hyk5,1581467842.0,"I’d continue to grind and pack the vape in the other room with the fan as that probably smells the most. But I think you’re fine to vape in the living room, just light a candle and crack a window you’ll be good. Vapor hardly smells and it dissipates quickly and doesn’t stick to fabrics like smoke."
bostontrees,fhcogq3,t3_f2h4tm,1581467322.0,"I would have recommended the Fisherman’s Catch in Wells but they are closed for the season. Amazing seafood there though so keep it in mind for if you go back in the spring/summer!  

The Maine Diner in Wells is famous (was on the food network more than once) and has some good diner food. The chicken pot pie is so good. And for dessert some blueberry pie with fresh Maine blueberries and vanilla ice cream. 

There are many places around the Ogunquit area as well just can’t think of any specifics."
vaporents,fh8fufn,t3_f1tjvf,1581358841.0,"Oil in vape pens is made up of almost entirely THC. Flower contains THC but not in such a concentrated form as the oil. So when you take a hit of an oil pen your hit contains way more THC than a hit from a flower vape, therefore you will get higher from one hit of an oil pen vs one hit from a flower vape. 

But the high from a flower vape might last longer due to being a more well rounded full spectrum high since flower has more terpines and compounds that work together to give you the high and isn’t just concentrated THC."
AskReddit,fh7o6r0,t3_f1irzw,1581339798.0,"Weed. Seriously. 

I have terrible anxiety around falling asleep and knowing I have to get up in the morning and be alert and productive. 

Weed is the only thing that relaxes me and turns off my anxiety and racing thoughts at night. I usually fall asleep quite easily after a bowl or two. I have a med card for this, it really does help and is better than traditional sleep medication."
bostontrees,fh65pf0,t1_fh0si2c,1581295401.0,"That was their old rewards program, they don’t do that anymore. Also you could have spent over the amount required and they would have given you the discount, that was just the minimum.

They now have a new patient discount 25% off first purchase and then a renewal discount which is a punchcard with 2 $100 off of $200 discounts if you go within 60 days of renewing your card."
craftymighty,fguflmw,t1_fgsmwf3,1581119597.0,"Yeah it can be changed to Fahrenheit but it has to be done on the app I think. It still won’t work on the iPhone but Storz and Bickel creates a web version, I think you can find it on their website"
craftymighty,fgsezi6,t3_f04k8f,1581082498.0,"Different terpines in weed are released at different temps. Lower temps between 350-370F are good for daytime and higher temps between 380-410F are good for night time as they release terps that make you sleepy. 

So if I’m using during the day I start at 360 or 365 and bump up to 370 after a few hits and finish there. If I’m using at night I go 380-390-400-finish at 410.

Try experimenting and seeing what you like!"
bostontrees,fgseivp,t3_f0a7ay,1581082124.0,"A med card does not automatically protect you, it’s still under your employer’s discretion wether they will accept that or not. There is not a law in place to protect those with medical cards from drug testing.

There was one court case where someone was fired over testing positive in Massachusetts. I believe this person already had the job and it was a random test. They took it to court and won. But that’s really all we have to go by.

You can get a MMJ card in one day technically. Make an appointment with a MMJ doc, pay, and you will get your temp card the same day to print and use. And should have your plastic card within a week. You won’t have any trouble getting one MA hands them out like candy. 

Sorry for your situation, good luck! If anything do a re-test with some fake urine."

TooAfraidToAsk,fgqlarr,t1_fgpzcug,1581026369.0,I went through the same a few years ago when I got my puppy and it just solidified my plan to never ever have children. It just seems like a nightmare that I know I wouldn’t be suited for.
vaporents,fgqcmap,t1_fgq49nf,1581021761.0,Ok take one from me
bostontrees,fgpyqp1,t3_ezsrd6,1581014569.0,"Currently they actually have a decent selection of flower with a few new additions (Jillybean and Cinderella 99, had Rosetta Stone a few weeks ago)

But I’m afraid to try any of them as the last few times I’ve been the flower has been terribly dry, flavorless, and barely has any effect on me. I don’t want to waste money on flower that isn’t getting me medicated.

Would be cool to hear from someone who has bought flower from them in the past month or so, curious to see if my above statements are still true."
bostontrees,fgnnzxx,t3_ezjirn,1580949062.0,"1. Nope no issue as long as you’re 21+ with a valid ID or passport.

2. Some dispensaries set their own buy limits due to short supply. But the state limit is 1 ounce so you could go to other rec dispensaries and purchase more. 

3. Never been so can’t answer this, but hope my other answers helped!"
vaporents,fgnkk5h,t1_fgnk1ea,1580946803.0,"You’re already buying bud to vape so no extra money being wasted. You’re already vaping your bud, so no extra time wasted there. 

You don’t have to bake with it, you can literally eat it off a spoon with some peanut butter. It’s already de-carbed so it’s ready to eat right after you vape it."
vaporents,fgnjsz9,t3_ezis0w,1580946345.0,"It’s really just a way to save money by using your weed twice, once to vape and once to eat. I don’t think it’s really about taste or quality, some just like to get the most out of their bud since it’s expensive for a lot of people."
