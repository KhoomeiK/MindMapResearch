Broken in 3 places, had surgery to install a metal plate and 9 screws. I’m in Canada, cost me nothing. I always wondered what that would have cost in the States. 5 years later I did the same thing to my right ankle; 13 screws this time. If my savings hadn’t been wiped out the first time, they would have been the second time. 5 years after that my gallbladder was messed up, emergency surgery required. 

In the past I tried talking to some folks in the States about getting universal healthcare (I guess “Obamacare” at the time) and it didn’t go well. Usually I got called a communist and told to shut up. But I honestly want to know why being able to go to the ER and paying zero $ is a bad thing!!"

However, I started to go about 3 weeks after surgery. My staples were out and my incision had healed.  If you have a cast on, you’re right that you’ll have to wait. 

The physio started by seeing what the range of motion was on my ankle. Then they did really gentle stretching to improve my range of motion. They put my ankle in a warm bath first to warm up the muscles etc. They also did a bit of electrical stimulation. 

Good luck with your orthopedist! Hopefully you don’t have damage and just need to heal the bones. I’ll keep my fingers crossed for you!"

JUSTNOMIL,fo5u3xl,t3_g5kd4h,1587535742.0,"My MIL didn’t like me either. I tried to ignore it. Example: when we got engaged her first words were “you know you don’t have to get married, right?” 

Hubby and I had decided we weren’t going to have children. Making that decision made her feelings towards me easier to handle. I knew there wouldn’t be the typical criticism on child rearing so the only bitching she could do would be about me. I didn’t feel like worrying about it since I was working full time and my hubby (her son) was unemployed. He was breaking into the film industry and the jobs were few and far between in the early years. I financially supported the two of us and emotionally supported him in his goal of working in film. 

Over the years we had our ups and downs. But then my FIL got sick with cancer. After he died things changed. One SIL had moved to another province 10 hours away. The other SIL was married to a hubby who could be difficult to be around. Eventually my MIL made the decision to sell the family home and buy a condo. Moving day was 2 days away and I found out that she hadn’t finished packing. The SIL who lived nearby had purposely left on vacation with her hubby and kids so that they wouldn’t be available to help. My hubby had gotten a film job and we didn’t want to risk him losing it so I took time off work. Went to her house, got her packed and stayed all the way through the move and got her settled in her condo. Made sure she was eating. She was a mess. Leaving the house where she’d lived for 40 years and raised her children... and the only person there was me. 

Things changed after that. I think she’s grown to appreciate me for who I am. I might not be what she pictured for her only son but I make him happy. We recently achieved one of my hubby’s biggest dreams, we bought a house on an acre of land in the countryside. He works full time in the film industry and loves it.  We’ve been married for 18 years now. 

I guess the only thing I can say is that there’s hope things can get better. If you feel your man is there for you, trust your gut."

Pretty much at the end of the movie where his wife (the doctor) tearfully tells all his friends that “his heart just can’t take it”. Take what exactly? Was it damaged? Arteries clogged? What exactly can’t it take? And then Sam Worthington says “oh, he can have mine.”  Um... don’t you need the same blood type? Do you have anti-rejection drugs available for after surgery?"

I mean... gosh. If chest compressions don’t work, screaming will work for sure. 🤦‍♀️"

thewalkingdead,fk3f86c,t1_fjzh7x5,1583830587.0,"OMG, I came here to say exactly the same thing!! I said to my husband as the walkers were coming forward “the dragons are going to fly by any minute now”.  

I also theorized that the people with the helicopters (who took Rick) were going to fly over and take out the herd from above. (using a helicopter as a dragon substitute)"

insaneparents,fj8w3df,t3_fc0vxb,1583123848.0,"Based on your father’s behaviour, I wouldn’t wait until the end of the year to leave. Now that you have a new job, see if anyone there has a room to rent. Contact the bank and have your father’s access revoked from your account. I know you want to save up to move but what’s the point in saving to an account he can drain at any time? You’re better off spending a portion of your paycheque on rent and saving your own money. 

If your dad is this controlling, once he sees that you’ll be able to get away he’s going to do something to get you back. Even if it doesn’t make sense that he’s threatening to kick you out, his issue is control. You need to get away from his control."

GabrielFernandez,fj1mkkd,t3_f9yvrc,1582923203.0,"My question is: Why did the mother and boyfriend call 911. Nobody was looking after this kid. Not CPS, not the cops. If the mom and boyfriend had let him die and then buried him somewhere, they probably would have gotten away with it. 

Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad they called and are in jail. I’m glad this all came to light. 

I just don’t understand how they thought they could allow EMTs, doctors, etc. see the damage to his body and believe nothing would happen to them. Unless they believed that since they got away with it for so long why wouldn’t they get away with it again?"

AskReddit,fiwdckq,t3_fa00m2,1582781944.0,"I live outside Vancouver, Canada. You literally cannot buy a house for $1,000,000.  Even a tear-down crap shack is about $1,250,000 these days.  $100,000 might give you a down payment on a condo or townhouse but your mortgage would be huge. Can’t imagine what the prices will be in 10 years!"
90dayfianceuncensored,fiwcwq6,t1_fivztg0,1582781546.0,Exactly!!  Women his age are too smart for him or have enough maturity to see past a guy calling them his “Queen”.  He purposely chooses young women who are desperate. It’s gross and sad.

MaliciousCompliance,fii4zrj,t1_fihhv9z,1582417438.0,My company doesn’t understand this concept. If a good employee points out flaws they push them out and hire someone new who doesn’t ask questions.  The company is a Utility and essentially have a monopoly so they’ll never go out of business. It’s depressing.
dogs,fhidum7,t3_f391t6,1581622814.0,"If someone hasn’t already mentioned, I’d suggest looking into pet insurance. It’s a great way to budget for future vet bills.  Alternatively, set up a special savings account and put $50 a month in for future bills. Even if you adopt a dog with good genetics, things still happen. It’s a massive relief to be able to make medical decisions based on what’s best for your pet without having to think about how to pay for it."

JUSTNOFAMILY,fh9bwwh,t3_f1rwyq,1581377699.0,I just don’t get it. If I had a kid I would want them to have an amazing marriage. A proper wedding is really not important in the grand scheme of things!!
