I know comments from one shitty person may last a long time, possibly a life time. But you are so young. I promise you that one day you will find a man who loves you EXACTLY as you are.

It‚Äôs hard to believe my boyfriend loves me the way I am but I‚Äôm working on it. You are a work in progress, you‚Äôre only 17. 

For now, try to turn your love inward. Try to build yourself up. You have so many years to grow and change in life that your confidence will grow the happier you are with yourself as a person. Find little things about you that you like. Embrace your features that you like.

In a society that objectifies women constantly it‚Äôs hard not to place so much importance on our looks.

But I promise you one day you‚Äôll find someone who wouldn‚Äôt have you any other way.

DBT has been life changing for me. It‚Äôs a painful process to reprogram my behaviors but individuals with BPD and individuals with only some indicators of BPD (I‚Äôm the latter) have had success with it.

relationship_advice,fi834ti,t1_fi7r3t1,1582232555.0,"Ultimately, only you and your boyfriend know if you guys are right for each other. I‚Äôm just a stranger on the internet. 

When my ex boyfriend made degrading comments at the beginning of our relationship about my small breasts, I thought about it every single time we had sex throughout our 4 year relationship. I couldn‚Äôt unhear his comments. 

Do we all have preferences? Of course. But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to tell your significant other when it can/will hurt them. Especially when it comes to sexual satisfaction. 

I love thick, beautiful hair on a man. My current boyfriend is balding. But does it make me less attracted to him? Fuck no! Our sex life is amazing. I think he‚Äôs perfect the way he is. And I have never thought ‚Äúyeah not having a ton of hair to grab on to really takes away from our sex‚Äù because it doesn‚Äôt. 

I don‚Äôt know how a man his age feels like tits and ass will give him ‚Äúmore to do‚Äù during sex. That seems very immature to me. I also feel like his comments hurt you and affected your self esteem. You can‚Äôt unring that bell, I‚Äôm afraid. 

I‚Äôm just giving you my two cents. Again, I‚Äôm just a random stranger who‚Äôs been through something kind of similar. Now, being with a man who loves my breasts, I‚Äôm bummed my relationship with my ex didn‚Äôt end sooner. Having sex with my current boyfriend who loves my body and who doesn't make me question things beyond my control has been more fulfilling for me. 

The choice is yours. Is this a dealbreaker for you? Can you move past it? Only you know the answer :) I‚Äôm here to talk if you want. Wishing you all the best either way!
