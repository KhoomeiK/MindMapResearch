Dump him. I know that seems like it’d be an overreaction but it’s not. YOU CAN DO BETTER.

I struggle with the comparison to big breasted blondes all the time. I never HATED my small boobs until my ex, who made various comments about my breasts and about big boobed blondes. He constantly compared me.

Now, I’m with a man who worships my body. I still get triggered by certain things (I can’t even look at Kate Upton and when I try on low cut shirts I want to cry) but he loves me for ME.

I know comments from one shitty person may last a long time, possibly a life time. But you are so young. I promise you that one day you will find a man who loves you EXACTLY as you are.

It’s hard to believe my boyfriend loves me the way I am but I’m working on it. You are a work in progress, you’re only 17. 

For now, try to turn your love inward. Try to build yourself up. You have so many years to grow and change in life that your confidence will grow the happier you are with yourself as a person. Find little things about you that you like. Embrace your features that you like.

In a society that objectifies women constantly it’s hard not to place so much importance on our looks.

But I promise you one day you’ll find someone who wouldn’t have you any other way.

BPD,finav51,t3_f8kdb2,1582559692.0,"I was in your shoes and it’s been a long process to unlearn those behavior patterns (I’m still working on it!). Do you have a therapist? If not, I suggest finding a therapist who specializing in DBT (Dialectical Behavioral Therapy). DBT can be useful in treating BPD, mood disorders, suicidal ideation, and for change in behavioral patterns such as self-harm, and substance abuse.

DBT has been life changing for me. It’s a painful process to reprogram my behaviors but individuals with BPD and individuals with only some indicators of BPD (I’m the latter) have had success with it. 

If you can’t afford or don’t have access to therapy, there are a ton of DBT resources and workbooks available online. I also recommend the podcast “The Skillful Podcast” which specializes in DBT. 

Hang in there, it can and will get better. The good news is that with time and work, you can get better. You’re not alone!

relationship_advice,fi834ti,t1_fi7r3t1,1582232555.0,"Ultimately, only you and your boyfriend know if you guys are right for each other. I’m just a stranger on the internet. 

When my ex boyfriend made degrading comments at the beginning of our relationship about my small breasts, I thought about it every single time we had sex throughout our 4 year relationship. I couldn’t unhear his comments. 

Do we all have preferences? Of course. But I don’t think it’s fair to tell your significant other when it can/will hurt them. Especially when it comes to sexual satisfaction. 

I love thick, beautiful hair on a man. My current boyfriend is balding. But does it make me less attracted to him? Fuck no! Our sex life is amazing. I think he’s perfect the way he is. And I have never thought “yeah not having a ton of hair to grab on to really takes away from our sex” because it doesn’t. 

I don’t know how a man his age feels like tits and ass will give him “more to do” during sex. That seems very immature to me. I also feel like his comments hurt you and affected your self esteem. You can’t unring that bell, I’m afraid. 

I’m just giving you my two cents. Again, I’m just a random stranger who’s been through something kind of similar. Now, being with a man who loves my breasts, I’m bummed my relationship with my ex didn’t end sooner. Having sex with my current boyfriend who loves my body and who doesn't make me question things beyond my control has been more fulfilling for me. 

The choice is yours. Is this a dealbreaker for you? Can you move past it? Only you know the answer :) I’m here to talk if you want. Wishing you all the best either way!

ETA: can he cut back on his drinking and see if that makes a difference?"

It would be entirely different if he was able to maintain an erection despite what he views as not his ideal body type. It’s clearly unattractive enough to him to damage their sex life.
