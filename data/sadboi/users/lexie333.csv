AdultChildren,fqea3bw,t3_gi1in3,1589304202.0,"I look at being anger at someone is really using up my energy. Then the question I ask myself “do I think I am that powerful enough that my resentment or angry can change this person into being the person I have always wanted.”
  It comes down to allowing yourself to let the anger go and that it wasn’t your fault and you are not responsible for this person’s behavior. You could have never made this person be the ideal parent. The guilt is on the parent for mistreating the child.  
  The alcoholic causes so much harm and damage to everyone around them. I don’t think there is one single person who doesn’t have resentment/anger for the abuse they have received. 
   It comes with the acceptance and a reasonable expectation in a really sick person who has a very sick behavior. They are not normal. They could not be a parent. 
    I totally understand how the anger builds up over time to hating that person because of all the injustices they have caused to yourself. 
    I turned my anger into doing activities by keeping busy to get rid of the negative energy. 
I go exercise which dissolves the emotion of anger.  I garden or paint.  Talking to someone  helps.  
   Anger is kind of a control we think we have that will change the response or intimidate  a person.  It’s doesn’t work.  It’s just a bag of energy that you need to remove from yourself.  
It is also forgiving that person that they did the best they could have done being that sick.  I don’t think anyone sets out to be an alcoholic and when they are they can’t stop, just  like someone smoking a cigarette."

AlAnon,fn3cqaz,t3_fysxzn,1586618008.0,"I can relate that living with an alcoholic is psychologically damaging. It is hard because I expected my alcoholic to have normal behavior such as to be kind, thoughtful, unselfish, giving, pay attention, communicate, support etc... 
I have found that the best way to stay sane in an alcoholic home is NOT to expect normal behavior but abnormal behavior. The lying, cheating, gaslighting, slurred speech, forgetfulness, throwing me under the bus with ugly comments, projecting their shame onto another person  is part of their personality.  That is it and it will not change until they seek recovery. 
  This means I treat the person that he has been drinking and to stay far away preferably in another room.  If he comes in the room, I leave the room. If he opens his mouth, I say huh And leave the room. I do not engage because this leads to fighting and causing me stress.  I agree with what he says to avoid fights, and I don’t enable my alcoholic. 
  What I do is keep busy with self-focusing projects, reading, exercising which reduces stress and makes me feel better, journaling my feelings and thoughts, walking outside, writing my thoughts in an alanon board, wearing headphones, watching a funny movie, and talking to a friend that understands. 
   It is too much to bare the emotions alone living with an alcoholic that is why I need people that understand and support me.  Otherwise, I can feel myself be angry for no reason, building resentment, sad, lonely, increased anxiety, thoughts in my head that are negative, eating too much, sleeping too much, and isolating myself from people. 
    There is a way to be happy living with an alcoholic but it has taking me a long time to practice detachment.  
    It has changed my whole way of looking at an alcoholic.  It is their problem to fix not mine. I am not responsible for their behavior and actions where I am responsible for mine.  I can't fix them to stop them from drinking by hiding their booze, searching for their booze, tracking them down to find out which bar they are hiding, waiting for them to come out of the bar, write a note on their car that I know where they are and they can't lie, catch and bait them in a lie, and try to communicate how I feel when they are drunk!  Doesn't all this behavior sound like a crazy person? You bet it does and it is not good for me to act like this so I stopped.  When I start to think I am going to act like this, I tell myself to STOP and ask myself what am I going to do for myself.  It’s saying Stop, stop stop to myself most days but now I am better at taking care of myself. 
Oh boy, I feel good about myself when I changed how I acted with my alcoholic. I was always waiting for the alcoholic to change and I thought I could make that happen.  Actually what I found when I changed, I saw my alcoholic change. 
   It is all about finding the strength and courage  inside myself.  You can too!!"

   The only problem I have is he has to go out and buy liquor everyday, thus putting our whole family at risk. Before Covid, he would leave 3 or 4 x a day to go buy liquor.  Now he makes the excuse he has to go to the grocery store everyday. Even 2x a day. 
   I told him just buy a case of liquor.  Maybe he isn’t taking this covid  virus seriously ??? Maybe he thinks it will not happened to him.  I have a daughter who is high risk.

Nope, it’s always defensive, gaslighting, says no I didn’t yo everything. He lies so much I don’t even allow his words to soak in. I just say I see!! 
   Well when someone is drinking, I don’t depend on them unless the task is simple but I still don’t expect much.  Mine is functional to a point. He spends about 5 minutes with the kids. 
  If I want to talk, it’s in the morning before drinking. 
  Once they drink, it’s blaa blaa blaa what they hear. 
   I reduced my family stress by detracting which takes awhile to do. 
   I pretty much ignore what, where he is drinking. I don’t look for him. I assume he is drinking. So you don’t have to wonder. Deep down you know.
   If my is drinking, he walks in a room and I walk out. If he follows me I go to the bathroom. It is not worth the fighting.  
   I miss the company if I can call it that with my AH.  I focus on myself and what did I need to have a healthy emotionally mind. 
    My AH has taken over the basement. I think he is doing what apps and sexing girls.  I don’t know but I assume bad behavior. All I know is I get my bedroom to myself stress free. I get my space to relax.  This is what I do to survive and be happy. It’s not a marriage but does anyone have a marriage with a drunk anyway.  
  I have a relationship with my kids and we have fun. I stopped dwelling on what the AH wasn’t doing. If he wants to participate when he sober we let him hang with us otherwise everyone goes to their room or hangs with me. 
   Personally I think it is not heathy to spend any emotionally time with a drunk. I always want to spend my time with winners and people that care about themselves. 
    I pray that I am not a slave to a master except God. I have free will and can chose how to live my day.  It’s too bad they can’t see what they are missing.  I know you can’t get in their way of getting a drink or stop them. They have got to do that themselves. 
    What’s funny is that he used to isolate to drink or go to bars. We are so used to him being out of the picture we ignore him when he is around.  Now it ducks not to have a person in your life.. 
     It’s a sad sad life the alcoholic owns. I wouldn’t want it at all. Hence I barely drink. I see what drinking can do to a person. My vice is to have my body as a temple , eat healthy, be kind to myself, and make a life for myself."

I am glad I found alanon which has helped me to not believe the drunk that projects his guilt and shame onto me.  He always made me out to be the crazy one and don’t let your drunk do that to you.  They will deny that they even drink which is so stupid because it is obvious that he has been. I think we could pool all the drunk together because they all behave the same and treat the nonalcoholic the same.

The stress level went to 10%.  There is nothing I can do but work on myself, my dreams, and create relationships with others.  I want to treat this Q as normal, but there is NO Normal behavior, and I don’t expect normal.  When I feel my anger swelling in me, I know I have set my expectations as normal.

   First of all, you have to conquer that little voice that tells you to not get out of bed.  The first thing in the morning you have to pop up and go take a shower and plan your day. 
   You do need caring people who are a positive influence on you. 
    Take up exercise.  Once you get the runners high, you are hooked.  You start slow with baby steps.  Little goals like go to your mailbox and back. The next day a little further.  Tell yourself what a huge accomplishment you have done. 
   When depressed everything looks bleak, black, and unexciting.  You have to force yourself to be positive. Write positive notes on your mirror.

   I do have dissociation and it can happen at any time but it takes me away from the moment and then I zoom back.

   Unless it is out of control and interferes with your life, it is normal to zone out.

   I have learned I will not understand an alcoholic because I am not an addict.  It doesn’t matter if you will plead or threaten for them to stop they simply can’t do it. They are chained to drink alcohol until they get a wake up call. They have got to want to change. 
    The lies go with the addict. They will not cave to let you know who they are.  They can’t live with who they are either. 
    There are too many alcoholic out there. Satan sure had a great plan to throw drugs and alcohol out there for people because you only serve one master.  
    Nobody wants to feel uncomfortable or go through pain. It’s must be hard to fight the cravings. Just ask the sugar addict to stop eating sugar.. 
     I have watched so many druggies and alcoholics die. Even death doesn’t scare them to stop. Think about that. When you truly understand an addict, you will know they can’t quit for you or for their children. It’s a very sad reality. You have to be a beacon of hope for yourself and children."

I do the fasting as much as possible because I feel better,  my mind is clearer, and I have more energy.  To me, it is harder coming back from a cheat day into a fast.

It took awhile for me to notice his second addiction since he travels with his job. He gambles and he is a sex addict. Nice, eh. He has been fired from one job because he must have did something to a girl at work. I will never know the truth.  He hid this from me but everything seems to come out in the open eventually! 
   He will drink every night. He comes home and he is slurring his words and saying stupid things.  I say 90% of the time he goes straight up to bed and that is around 6:00 pm. I am blessed he passes out most of the nights.  I get in between him and the kids when he is angry and shoot him away! I tell the kids not to listen.  I would never let him touch the kids. Now you can video him. 
   But with this said, an alcoholic gets worst every year.  He doesn’t get better.  
    My husband got quite a scare with his blood pressure going to 180/140 and he had to go to the doctor. I made him tell the doctor he drinks, of course, he said I came back from a business trip and drank too much. He sugar coated his drinking habit. It is always lies. I will never believe him ever.  He actually has cut down on his drinking. How do I know? His behavior has changed.  He doesn’t disappear and does not say where he is going. He also has gout in his toes. So the consequences of his drinking for 50 years is catching up and scaring him.

It might be a distraction or part of getting attention by being an overachiever.  Sometimes keeping so busy keeps my thoughts quiet. When I am alone too much, my thoughts can make me depressed, angry, and resentful.
   My feelings about being abused  created a desire to be a perfectionist and an overachiever in myself.  As I was told by my therapist, I should have been on a self destructive path and been a drug addict to numb the pain.  I guess I chose to exercise to numb myself.  I did keep very busy and I have 2 degrees and did every sport possible.  I was negligent at home and abused.  I am afraid of everything and people.  I feel I have been free of my pain by doing EMDR therapy. Nothing else worked for me to get rid of all the triggers from my childhood.  I never knew what was wrong with me until I got the dx of CPTSD which finally made sense and I could find a treatment.

By covering and cleaning up, the alcoholic thinks everything is fine.  When they pass out, they usually forget everything that happened and when you clean up afterwards they think everything is fine. 
    I try to focus on myself to take the razor sharp focus off the Q.  I got myself so wrapped around what my Q did every minute. I have stepped back and I make sure I make plans for my life.  
   Anyway the embarrassment is theirs to figure out, although the Q can affect everyone around them. Take a break and spend some time away.  I know this is very hard to do but it is unhealthy to be too close to an addict.  You become their rescuer and they need to rescue themselves.  You start thinking you can fix them and change them.
