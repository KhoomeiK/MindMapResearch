I spoke to her about it and she apologized and told me I'm allowed to be angry and what she did wasn't okay and she wishes she could have done some things differently and it made me feel heard and understood and I'm so thankful.

Look, not everyone is going to reciprocate your feelings of wanting to reconcile and that's okay, people are allowed to decide to not be around you. However, what I've found has the best results (mostly with close friends and my parents) is to take full responsibility. First, admitting what headspace you were in but, not as an excuse, just to give them context of where your mind was at at that moment, then you go into why you reacted the way you did. But NOT blaming them, don't say ""because you did soandso"" say along the lines of ""because I didn't handle it properly"" and then genuinely apologize. Admit that your brain is sometimes against you and it's hard to control but commit to learning from every episode and every bad experience and then show them, in time, that you are really trying.


I have lost countless friends, not all my fault but my bipolar plays a part in them all. And I must say, the few people who have stayed, the few people who took the time to listen to my apologies and believed in me and give me time to grow and learn are the most amazing people I have ever met. They're caring and patient which is what we need. You'll find those people through all the friendships you mess up. Some friendships are only supposed to happen to teach you something. Not all our friends are going to end up on our porch with us when we're old, and that's okay."
