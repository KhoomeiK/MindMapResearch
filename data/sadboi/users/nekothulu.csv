BPD,fp147nq,t3_ga8wg7,1588223949.0,"Me too. Im doing everything I can to entertain myself and be productive with my art.... but everyday, it feels like the things I enjoyed and revved my creative thinking/inspiration give me diminishing returns.

I’m drowning in a sea of blah."
Tinder,fotkyic,t1_fotjn8i,1588057171.0,Yea DST!
BPD,foelhv3,t3_g708tg,1587706997.0,Me too <3 It’s such a shitty feeling :( I try to be kind to myself but it’s really hard.
CasualConversation,fmm6zak,t3_fu1jcs,1586199934.0,"I used to have one but since she got married things have changed... I feel like I have some good friends but no one I really connect with as much. I really miss that, I’m finding it harder to find people who are into less mainstream things (especially stuff like the paranormal, cryptozoology, etc)"
BPD,flq349i,t1_flniq2u,1585377253.0,Yea that pretty much describes how I feel.
BPD,flq2zlu,t3_fpp7g6,1585377116.0,"Yea I feel weird about it too.FOMO is a big problem for me, I often feel lonely and left out. I also am dealing with sleep apnea and generally feel like the world is moving 200% faster than me, but now it feels more level and that i can afford to be exhausted and mentally foggy. I’m just worried for when things go back to normal and what the long term economic effects of this will be."
BPD,flq2cs5,t3_fq4hju,1585376441.0,"All my life I felt kind of vaguely out of place with being female and didnt feel like I fit into what is considered feminine, I always felt out of place and something was off somehow. As a kid for a long time I gravitated more toward playing with boys. Hated dresses, pink etc. It didn’t hit me until 2018 (Im 33 now) when I was reading a comic and when I saw one of the male characters, clear as day, a voice in my head said “That’s me”. For a few months I couldn’t stand even conceptualizing myself as partly female.
It felt gross and weird and uncomfortable. I hated my name and pronouns and cringed inside whenever I heard miss or m’am. When I started researching transitioning and considering new names and pronouns, he/him was closer but not 100% comfortable for me. I couldn’t see myself as a male either. Some small part of me still felt faintly female/a mix of both. 

Here’s the confusing part: I feel like I would be more comfortable wearing somewhat feminine clothing and wearing makeup if I were in a masculine body(or at the very least androgynous). I’m scared to but I desperately want top surgery. I fluctuate on whether I want to microdose Testosterone. Some days I feel like a weird
(I dont feel this way about other people, only myself) agender blob and anything remotely gendered feels so uncomfortable.

My closest friend’s first reaction was “are you sure it isnt your bpd?” She studies psych so I know she’s possibly right but this feels like the truest to myself I could be. Im just sad this didn’t happen 10 years sooner. I feel like Im too old and no one around me really buys it. It seems to me my generation has a harder time accepting it. I try to ask people to use different pronouns and sometimes different name but I feel awkward and don’t like to take up space so I often just stay silent. Sorry for the novel lol I’m still trying to come to grips with all this."
BPD,flq0r3g,t3_fq1nvp,1585374812.0,"Very similar for me.  I do eat meals with them but i sneak snacks, and have binge eating disorder and I always do that when im out of sight. My mom was always criticizing my weight and overly worried bout my health but i think it partially pushed me in the other direction (bingeing) or at least more than I would have."
BPD,fkrn32p,t3_fjv053,1584472087.0,"I’m definitely this way, I see it as a double edged sword. On the one hand it’s an attempt to be protective of the relationships I have, I fear if I express myself with negative emotions that I will get shut down and shunned, and ultimately abandoned. On the other hand it’s damaging to me because it all gets pent up and turns to depression, feeling suicidal and powerless. The more the weeks go by the less self esteem I have."
BPD,fkrk29k,t3_fk57nj,1584470400.0,"Yea im kinda feeling that way... My mental health has been so bad lately I’m kinda glad it’s forcing us to slow down for now..except the virus has taken a lot away from me: a trip id been planning for a year that i desperately needed for my mental health, and a convention  where I was going to sell my artwork. It’s my only source of income and we got no refund."
BPDmemes,fkq1k57,t1_fknzh5x,1584426749.0,"Same here, i hate it everytime."
BPD,fkhd8hr,t3_fi8t7m,1584195910.0,"Man that’s terrible. My situation isn’t as bad but it’s affected me as well. I’m an artist who sells at conventions, and needed an upcoming one for various reasons (financial, creates structure/deadline etc). That got cancelled and no refund. It’s the only income I get, a few times a year. I’d also been planning a trip with my mom that I desperately needed for my mental health. I just feel so discouraged and empty."
BPDmemes,fkeled5,t3_ff3l14,1584115591.0,Me 150%
BPDmemes,fkeifwd,t3_fhnaiu,1584113847.0,In all seriousness his story is heartbreaking
BPDmemes,fkeiaf4,t1_fkegxhd,1584113757.0,Seconded
BPD,fka65wg,t3_fh8oii,1583993975.0,"Yea I relate to that. The college I went to is 6h away from where I live. I made some great friends and it was super hard to leave. Can you stay in touch/visit them? I go back at least once a year, and sometimes they come here. I know it’s not at all the same but it’s better than nothing. 

Or would you have the option to stay? Would it be feasible to get a job and rent a place if you feel you’re happier there?"
BPD,fk6ndfr,t3_fgsfns,1583907986.0,"I feel like this about 2/3 of the time :( too afraid of pain, messing it up, hurting family in my case."
BPD,fjwvgpx,t3_feqabt,1583646917.0,It’s been nearly 2 years for me. I can’t really picture it that well anymore. And yea my self esteem is nonexistent. I feel like a horrible and ugly person that could not appeal to anyone anymore.
BPD,fjwuphx,t3_ff7vru,1583646335.0,"It’s becoming like this for me too. I’m turning 34 soon and I just don’t see a future for myself. I can’t take this much longer.
Virtual hugs 😞"
BPD,fjwulux,t3_ff82ku,1583646260.0,Wow ive never thought of it like that. That’s a really interesting take on it. I also think I have some version of aphantasia (similar to you with flashes). As a visual artist it’s my personal hell!
BPD,fjwtrhw,t3_fegxgc,1583645663.0,"DAE feel like they’re a “placeholder” friend? Like people will make vague plans with you (if even that) but then more important or fun prospects come along and you’re bumped out? And if I dare say anything it makes me into a needy person, in their eyes. Im honestly tired of feeling unimportant to people and it’s really getting to me."
BPD,fjwswwz,t3_ff3agq,1583645010.0,"That’s terrible :( Im really sorry you went through that. 

It’s not quite the same but I went through bullying and social rejection all through my school years, and when talking about it with her she said what I went through “wasn’t that bad” and that I was a difficult child. She implied that I was remembering things wrong and that it shouldn’t affect me how it did. I was terrified to go to school and have become a nervous wreck as an adult. I felt very gaslighted and invalidated to my core, it still hurts to think about. It felt like I was being told “well youre different so of course people treat you badly”. Maybe that’s an exaggeration but I cant think of it any other way.

Hve you ever spoken to her about how you feel?"
BPD,fjws7of,t3_ff1lu5,1583644466.0,"Welcome to the club haha. I also have sleep apnea, the combo is a nightmare. I wouldnt wish apnea on anyone. Adhd comes with hyperfocus which can be useful (sometimes) but usually it means Im spacey as FUCK and then get intrusive thoughts that everyone thinks I’m an idiot, become hypervigilant about social interactions and then can’t think straight.  Fun times!"
BPD,fjwrmxh,t1_fjuqw7f,1583644018.0,I feel similarly :(
BPD,fjwreid,t1_fjwrc0t,1583643837.0,"*meant to write, Have sleep apnea and adhd which could account for it."
BPD,fjwrc0t,t3_ff0nrr,1583643786.0,"Man do I relate to this. Ive been struggling with this for a long time, but I also have sleep apnea (which is getting worse) and possibly adhd. My mental state has been getting increasingly worse cause I just cant pay attention/retain anything Im trying to understand, be it convos, movies, books (especially hard for me). I worry I’ll never be able to work again cause I am so spacey. I don't rly have advice just wanted to say I feel ya :("
SuicideWatch,fewciii,t3_eqljno,1579408374.0,"Dude I can only imagine what that feels like. Although ive had relationships ( which all fell apart) but I always feel about 10 years behind my peers in terms of achieving things, and feel generally useless. I feel like im wandering around aimlessly, too anxious to get a real job and  trying to get some sort of art career going, but I suck at it. As the years go by I start to feel more and more like I get treated/spoke to differently because of how different I am and not in a good way. Which in turn makes me more self conscious and act strangely, Im becoming more shy and less sure of myself. I look at myself now and wonder why anyone would be into me. 
Feeling like an incompetent idiot who will never fit in is so crushing. I stay alive for my family, but just barely.

Sorry for the rant, all this to say I relate to that"
