BPD,fq1s4rc,t3_ggeroa,1589048546.0,"I think this is a trend in society as a whole right now that has carried over into the BPD community, not one that the BPD community is disproportionately guilty of. I read an article about the study of brain activity in people with BPD, and while it did show the areas of the brain accounting for what we'd consider empathy and understanding for motivation behind actions was less active than a neurotypical brain, it did show evidence that pwBPD might have a greater awareness of severe emotional duress and perhaps more likely to pick up on the warning signs for people with PTSD and the like, which i found fascinating. Not agreeing or disagreeing, just sharing something i thought was interesting and saying this is not an exclusively BPD issue. 

TLDR; the term ""empath"" for anyone experiencing the human ability to empathize is a trend outside this community. Included something cool i learned about empathy, BPD, and brain scans"
BPD,fpw91xs,t3_gfoeay,1588959342.0,"Yes, the regret, shame, and guilt i feel becomes incredibly overbearing and results in a period of isolation. ""I should never talk to anyone ever"" I think and mostly I dont. 
Using crisis/therapy apps like 7 cups of tea has been somewhat of a safe outlet because its anonymous and I often dont feel the same way about sharing there, but the feedback support can be very hit or miss. Often miss."

I bet I'd even be jealous of me."

In moments where i cannot reason with myself, i will usually make a point to avoid communication with others as much as possible. if someone brings up an important discussion I'll tell them im not in a place to give that topic the conversation it deserves, but will tell them when i can. 
A personal mantra i use for this is ""i may not see a way through this today, but i know other days i have been able to and those days will come again."" 
I use whatever distraction (not social media) depending on my energy level to keep the intrusive thoughts at bay until it passes: tv, music, dancing, singing, piano, cooking

But also please talk to your doctor and therapist about what youve been feeling. Its important you're not keeping all of this inside."

He also told you he left his previous girlfriend because of her mental health problems. He sounds like a self absorbed person who is not a good support system. There will  never be an easier time to leave him than now. You did absolutely nothing wrong and you deserve a lot more. The irony? He was being the negative Nancy. To the max!"
BPD,fpsw7s0,t3_gfbfae,1588880661.0,I usually struggle to articulate my feelings or major concerns when im with a therapist largely because i feel disconnected to those emotions.

I've decided to start journaling instead of letting the thoughts fester when I'm feeling internalized. Do you think if you wrote out what you needed to say that would help or that you would feel comfortable letting your therapist read it?

I find it frustrating because when i got my diagnosis as a teenager it was a big breakthrough, i had some sort of answer or starting point, before that I thought i was just a monster that was unlovable and TW, that i needed to die. Being diagnosed made me realize I wasnt just inherently ""wrong."" I began studying psychology, taking what classes i could in school and studying BPD online. So yeah, we may be people who are mentally ill and not mental health professionals, but we have personal experience and many of us have taken a personal interest in educating ourselves for 10+ years....so its a little comical when someone who has no experience and has put little effort into understanding wants to challenge and invalidate us on something that has greatly impacted our lives. Truly great point. People definitely do that too."
BPD,fpfece0,t1_fof44o3,1588568771.0,"Most nasty people who do this are people who wanted to help, but people, even without mental illness, are flawed and often undereducated on mental health esp BPD. This experience is more common than not, you dont know someone is going to gaslight you until they do. People with abandonment issues can often struggle to walk away from someone who says problematic things to them largely because we know how it feels to want to be accepted, warts and all, so often times these situations can go on longer than they should once trust has been formed."
BPD,fpf9okb,t3_gct946,1588565189.0,"Since childhood I've had an issue where i will bite off little pieces of my tongue. I will go at it for hours, days, thinking maybe if i can just get it smooth I can stop but i never can. Ive always associated this with my OCD. I find it particularly difficult because the compulsion is so strong and i start it without realizing it. I can feel my tongue against my teeth and the compulsion is too much to resist, there's nowhere else for me to go. Its always right there waiting for me to nibble, chew, gnaw. It doesnt matter if it's bleeding, the compulsion doesnt go away. I try to distract myself with mints, cinnamon toothpicks because they burn the cut areas, ice, or eating, but I still consider it to be a big issue. I'll even avoid responding in a conversation because im ""busy"" working on getting to a brief stopping point, but really i want to be left alone because in those moments im doing something and anyone who takes me away from it is disturbing me. Most people don't know i do this and think i make weird faces all the time. Loved ones have come to recognize the face and will tell me to stop doing it, as if it were that easy. I always feel my tongue brushing against my teeth, throbbing, when they tell me to stop. I really do try. I would not say i enjoy it or that I'm in control of it though."
IAmA,foken8a,t3_g6opvj,1587840656.0,"What do you think contributes to the disproportionate stigmatization of borderline personality disorder despite it not being one of the most colloquially discussed diagnoses?

To clarify, there is stigma with all mental illness, but often times the discussion i see towards BPD is that they are energy vampires who are beyond help and your best shot is to cut all ties, further cementing the abandonment component of this disorder. The treatment by the general public is dehumanizing."
IAmA,fokacme,t3_g7xijv,1587838358.0,"Thanks for doing this, I'm a psych enthusiast and diagnosed BPD and OCD myself. Ive seen firsthand the polarizing stigmatization that occurs disproportionately with this diagnosis. 

Do you think theres any parallels between BPD, PTSD, and attachment disorder? 

How do you think BPD will differ for someone who grew up in the home with a parent who also suffered from it? 

What do you think are some good reading materials on different types of therapy and implementation aimed at BPD patients?"
SandersForPresident,fl25vxn,t1_fl1xn0r,1584743637.0,"Bernie isn't a socialist, truthfully he isn't even  really a democratic socialist. It's more accurate to say that he's a social Democrat but the problem is that the democratic party has been slowly moving to the right since the 90s or before as the GOP has spun off into something else entirely. The democratic platform has always been that our taxes should go to things that benefit society: healthcare, schools, infrastructure and parks, fire and police. That's not radical, that's things that everyone benefits from. Bernie Sanders has always been respectful and diplomatic, pushing to resolve things with negotiations rather than put your childrens lives on the line to fight a war someone else decided on. He did not ask anyone to go to the polls and vote for him last Tuesday; he asked them to make the decision they felt safe with. He has not asked for any donations to his campaign in the past week and is soley focusing on getting donations to COVID-19 relief charities and channeling his movement towards getting his relief package passed in the senate.

Everything she's currently working on is somewhat polar Biden. I definitely agree her Clinton roots would lead you to believe she'd align Biden, but I've seen everything to suggest the contrary.

There is video evidence of him repeatedly asking to speak to his mother, but being denied access and questioned alone. There is video of him telling them he was at the grocery store when he was 16, this is not a new story. He begged them to check the security tapes. There is video of the prosecution interrogating witnesses who say they dont know anything and increasingly offering them hundreds of dollars for anything they can give them, even if it's just ""hearsay"" in their own words, they just need a name and they can give you $500 so you can eat for a couple weeks.
