PublicFreakout,fc7dd0o,t1_fc7cwqm,1577504111.0,"How was his service being interrupted?? HE had an entirely different nail tech. She didn't just ""break a nail"". Her acrylic nails were falling off after she just had them done days ago. That should NOT have happened. Especially since she spent $100+ on them. 

I'm guessing you've never worked in customer service seeing as the nail tech she was talking to should have resolved the situation in a professional, mature manner. She should have offered to redo her nails when she was finished with her current customer or offered to give her a refund. That is how customer disputes are normally resolved at a nail salon, even the ones that charge a lot less than $100+ for a full set of acrylics."
PublicFreakout,fc6x14b,t3_eg87k3,1577491685.0,"Ok. The woman customer had a good point. She paid a lot of money for nails that were done poorly. The employee should have fixed the issue or given her a refund. I understand everything is more expensive in LA, but $100 + for nails is insane.  I would be pissed too.

The camera man was the one who needed to fuck off as it didn't concern him and he was just making things worse. Screw the ""[bad] energy"" he was feeling while someone worked on his feet. If a nail tech did a bad job on his feet he would want a refund or them to fix it too."

But given all the evidence of Patrick's hate for Kelsey, it is very safe to assume he did not want a baby with her. Then after Kaylee's birth, he may have changed his mind about Kaylee, but he was still determined to get rid of Kelsey.

I strongly suspect that Patrick never wanted to be a married father. He was cheating on the people he was cheating on Kelsey with. He's a sick sociopath that cares for no one but himself."
KelseyBerreth,f9f2sk5,t3_e4rmtc,1575258056.0,"Possibly. Patrick did not want Kelsey to have Kaylee. He did not want to be with Kelsey and he did not want to be tied to her for life because of Kaylee. After Kaylee's birth, he could deal with having her (Kaylee) in his life, but not Kelsey.

I really think he decided to seriously eliminate Kelsey in July 2018,when he stopped making the $700/month child support payments. July and after, he gave Kelsey the impression that they had a future together, but all the while, he was plotting to kill her."

Then he had to pay child support and he hated her for that too. I think he gave Kelsey the idea that they had a future together although he never proposed to her. When he stopped paying child support (July 2018?) I think he decided  then that he was going to get rid of her. He couldn't lead on to her that anything was wrong while he plotted against her.

So, I think the motive is money and the he hated her for her actions which he viewed as ruining his life. The way he killed Kelsey shows just how much he hated her."
