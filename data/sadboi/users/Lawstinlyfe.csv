toastme,fpf8krl,t3_gd0ptb,1588564411.0,I love the success stories! You're absolutely stunning! And thanks for coming back and letting us know how you are doing!
selfimprovement,fox3df0,t1_fox1hvo,1588133108.0,"I think i worded my response to you poorly. The point that I was trying to make is to make yourself the best version of YOU. You‚Äôre never going to be your friend, you‚Äôre two different people with two different backgrounds, families, and experiences both good and bad. All of these things, plus things like individual brain chemistry contribute to making us the only copy of ourselves as individuals. It took me a REALLY long time to finally realize this. 
Intelligence is such a debated and nebulous concept. It‚Äôs not just test scores or who is eligible for honor societies. Your friend may have an awesome GPA or SAT scores, but really sucks at something that you‚Äôre quite good at. Maybe you‚Äôre good at baking, or games, or seeing the silly side of life. All of that takes intelligence that can‚Äôt be measured on a test. It‚Äôs hard to see when you are looking from the inside out, but I would wager that there is something about you she wishes she was more like, or some ability that you have that she wishes she possessed. We‚Äôre all human, and we all have insecurities. 
On the other hand, kindness is certainly something we could all work on. We could all strive to be better at it, and if we chose to be more aware of situations where we could be kind, even if we had to model our behavior after someone to be kind in order to make the world a better place, that wouldn‚Äôt be so bad, would it?"
lonely,fox1j13,t3_ga24c0,1588131871.0,"Aren‚Äôt platitudes the worst? One thing that has helped me ‚Äúlove myself‚Äù is just being kinder to myself, treating myself like I would someone that I loved. Giving myself a day off when I needed it, making sure I‚Äôm eating, drinking, and getting outside enough. Not abusing my body, getting enough sleep. Not putting myself in uncomfortable situations, knowing and avoiding my emotional triggers. Things like that. And I‚Äôve found that just doing those little things has helped me value myself more."
selfimprovement,fox0u7h,t1_fox035h,1588131404.0,"In what way is she better? And in what way could you make yourself closer to that, to make yourself better? Sometimes, questions like these have helped me to begin to root out my jealousy and insecurity issues. It may be less of an envy thing then more of an insecurity thing for you? In what ways does she, or your relationship with her, make you feel insecure?"
toastme,fnsf597,t3_g3g2ky,1587220283.0,"RN here, you look great! I couldn't pull a shift like that and still have a smile on my face. I hope you've been able to relax and take care of you. We're in this together!"

toastme,f8p5or6,t3_e1c2j8,1574696091.0,"RN here. Nursing school is the toughest thing I think you'll ever do. It was for me. You are going to do great. It's going to be OK. It's all going to be OK. It may sound silly, but I can see a certain analytical intelligence and confidence in your eyes. I know to not judge a book by the cover, but I'd be totally cool with having you as a student or preceptee. These next couple of years are gonna be hella hard, but you are going to make it through, one step at a time. Please don't forget about self care. Those few, precious moments that you will have to love yourself and to maintain that strong foundation and confidence that you have to be able to keep moving forward are more important than anything else. You can't fill someone else's cup if yours is half-empty.

Gaining weight ... first of all, you don't look like you are overweight or anything. As a matter of fact, you're REALLY attractive. EVERYBODY either gains weight in nursing school or runs or works out like crazy. You are probably under more stress than you have ever been in your life and your body is going to respond appropriately. I don't have any advice for this, I'm really hefty, and some of that is due to my time in nursing school. (I don't recommend trying to do nursing school and work full-time. Uggh.) 

Patients dying ... none of that in any way is related to care you did or didn't provide. We all are mortal. And no amount of nursing or medical science is going to keep us alive in the end. I was a hospice nurse for a while, and so my patients died all the time. Emotionally, it's tough. But I have found comfort in knowing that I have provided good care to patients in their last days and comfort to friends and loved ones immediately before and after the patient has passed. We can't always prolong a life, but we can always provide comfort and good care. You are going to be amazing at this. Keep going. You've got this."

One thing that has helped me in the past is to keep reminding myself that my partner is another whole person, and I really want the best for them. I know that letting her get out and have a girl's night once in a while is a good thing for her, and it gives me some time to watch baseball or whatever that I like and bores her. I go out as well sometimes and let her watch say yes to the dress or whatever.  She has to give me a reason for me not to trust her.
