It's just that... there's a part of me that doesn't want to remain in hiding forever for the rest of my life.

As an 18 y/o in the closet and also having trouble with my faith, I can relate to your pain. I stopped going to Born Again Christian churches about a year ago, but I sometimes go to my neighborhood Catholic church with my family out of obligation.


I'm not officially out as an atheist/agnostic/bisexual person, and I couldn't tell my Christian friends my sexuality because they're all outspoken against it despite them claiming to ""respect"" the LGBTQ+. Sometimes I would pray asking God if I'm going to hell or if He really exists. But I would be lying if I said I don't miss church worship and some of the people there who gave me some hope back then.

Took ICT computer programming on senior high school. Almost all of my classmates are good at coding; I am not. The reason why I took ICT is because I used to remove my friends'/teachers' computer/flash drive viruses in Junior High. I originally was going to transfer to Humanities In Social Sciences (HUMSS) because I wanted to be an English Teacher, but was discouraged from being an irregular student. I also used to be passionate about writing poetry, reading novels and writing essays in competitions back then. After years of idleness, I'm having a hard time trying to revive my passion because I've changed as a person.


Even when now that I've become even more socially-awkward/anxious as a person, I'm currently taking Secondary Education (Major in English) first year of college. So far, my stay here is filled with awkward moments where I feel out of place, but I made some friends but we're not close."

Kind of similar to what Bill Hader said about managing/overcoming his anxiety. (but it a more calmer way lol) 


Bill Hader:
""And what helped me was that learning that it [anxiety] doesn't really go away. You manage it. And instead of pushing away your anxiety, and I always imagine my anxiety as this little monster that would kinda attack my face or pull at my ears, you know.
And instead of pushing that thing away and trying to fight it, I would just go *'Hey, oh hey, buddy'*. You know it was like a little monkey and I would just kinda go, *'Ok, here, just sit on my shoulder, sit on my shoulder. Let's hang out. Let's just chill out'*. There it is. 
And every time I would get nervous, I would just become friends with it. I know it sounds kinda corny, maybe or a little silly, but it's true it helped me kind of alleviate that fear. So I don't push it away. Put your arm around it and go *'Oh there you are. I knew you'd be there some place. Let's go take that test. Let's go get on the bus. Let's figure it out.'* And I wish I had done that when I was younger.""
