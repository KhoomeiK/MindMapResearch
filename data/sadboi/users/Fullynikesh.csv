I don't know anybody here who've been to therapy sessions, it's odd but true, so the concept's beem always strange to me. And the most important thing is, I want to be certain that it's OCD, symptoms say that way but still I want to have the certainty. I've been handling it well myself till now, I'm just preparing myself for future. I just wanted to know if it's diagnosable with a certainty or not.?"

Anxiety,ey1t2q3,t3_cv1cce,1566710174.0,"I've been going through anxiety for almost a year now. It wasn't that bad so I never needed to see a doctor. My exams are on and these past few weeks have been real hell. I'm mostly troubled by my intrusive thoughts, I try my best to avoid them but they just hit me out of nowhere when I'm watching something on YouTube or just scrolling through socual media. Thankfully my big brother understands me very well. He's helped me a lot to get through my daily activities. Believe me, having someone that understands you helps you a lot. I'm starting to see a pattern of how these intrusive thoughts occur and I hope I'd be able to resolve these thoughts with time. And I hope the best for you, just remember there are a lot of people out there with the same problem as you and that people recover from this."
