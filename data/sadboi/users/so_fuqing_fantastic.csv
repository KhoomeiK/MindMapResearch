you're in a place of hopelessness and despair, you're tired of fighting, and i can't say i blame you.  so am i.  but you have already gotten through so so much, and i can't promise it gets better, but seek out professional help, chase your dream, find purpose in something, anything. if there is one thing, *just* *one* that makes you happy, embrace it.  find one reason to go on. it can be anything. anyone.

cause in the end, we all have a choice, we can let it all go, or try go on. one painful step at a time. because nothing anyone says or does is going to end the war inside your mind.  whoever says otherwise obviously hasn't been in the place you are. days will seem pointless, and overwhelming.  it will get worse before it gets better. but you have support here.  people going through the same things you are. i am so sorry for the pain people have caused you, the things you've had to experience, the injustice. but you are strong for holding on so long, for even taking the time to write this letter.. please stay..

i don't know what your life looks like, other than what you've said, but is there anyone you can turn to? someone to confide in?

I'd never been big on rap before him, so most of his songs, I never really instantly memorized.

so believe me, getting confused because of the tests is very common, read through the types and you'll find what you're looking for.  and don't base it off of what is most offensive to you, base it off of the truth about who you are.  maybe you're not either and you just need to read through the other types.  who knows?"

* Do you hear the people sing. (obviously.)
* ABC Cafe/Red and Black
* Valjean's Soliloquy

I was seven when I first saw/heard Les Mis.  I didn't get obsessed with it till I was in my early teens.   But one of my favorite things has always been the symbolism and connection between Valjean's Soliloquy and Javert's Suicide.  It's pure genius.  In how in Valjean's Soliloquy he turned to hope, and light.  He realized he had to start anew, leaving his old self behind.  While in contrast, Javert's Suicide, he saw no more hope.  Only darkness.  The very morals he had based his whole life were shaken.  Javert gave into the despair.  While Valjean picked himself back up.

(this is probably obvious but I love it so much)

*Valjean's Soliloquy -*

BreakUp,fi1abyy,t3_f5ceby,1582053784.0,"Give yourself time, I actually recently broke up with my 6 month boyfriend, who just happened to my best friend 2 years prior.  We were always together too.

It hurts.  And it will hurt, and be confusing.  In fact, it might take a while just to fully process what you're feeling.  But give yourself time  to mourn what you lost.  Don't try and push yourself to feel better right away.  It doesn't work like that.

Let it hurt, let yourself come to terms with whats happened.  It's the only way to begin moving forward.

Take some time to figure yourself out, go to a friend, or someone you trust.  And when you're ready, talk to them about how you feel, about the good, the bad.  Going through a breakup alone, or without being open with the people around you about what you feel -  isn't something I'd suggest.  Only because you'll come to resent those around you for caring, or pushing you along to quickly.

You'll always find yourself thinking about the good of the relationship, how much you've lost.  And let that happen.  But If you only think about the GOOD of another person, or relationship, you'll never get over it.

Here's a psychology tip (if you don't want to do it, fine, I personally found it hard to do myself) but think of the bad qualities of the other person.  Of the relationship.  You'll feel like a shitty person doing it.  I sure as hell do.  I mean, genuinely, I like to look at the good in everyone, and find it hard to put someone down even when being horrible to me.

But it was the only way I got over who I did.  I don't think I've loved anyone as much as I loved him.  Which is saying a lot. But he was flawed and hurtful at times.  Really, he wasn't a very nice person.  So I focused on that, I focused how much he had hurt me, and how he treats others.

I still am thankful for the experience and will probably always love and miss him in some way. But letting myself think of the bad helped me come to terms with why it ended, and why you can move on to better things.

* So whatever you're feeling, let yourself feel it.
* Mourn, acknowledge what you've lost
* Let someone know the truth about how you feel, ask for advice, really just be open
* Find yourself a hobby, or invest time in something you love to do.  Keep busy.
* When you find yourself romaticising what you had, how good it was, remember the bad as well.
* Have fun, hang out with friends, go out.
* Invest time in yourself, be able to be happy on your own, and with where you are now.  (it's hard)

(this is a lot, sorry, there's definitely a lot more ways to get over a breakup.  But these are just things I wished I had known when I was at the end of an intense relationship.  But there is no ""one"" way to get over a relationship.  It's entirely different for everyone.  I just hope this helped a little, I'm really not an expert - obviously.. but I wish you the best :)"

Enneagram,fgn287x,t3_ezdrvg,1580936290.0,"Read the book ""The Sacred Enneagram"".  It's already been mentioned in the comments (and they were spot on) but I thought I'd just give it another shout out haha.  I find the main source of confusion people tend to have when figuring out their type, is when they take the test.  In general, people have alter-egos, or depending on a mood we're in, different views on how we see ourselves.  Not to mention the parts of ourselves we don't exactly like.  All of these things, and more, changing how we answer the questions.  

I took the test the first time and got 9w1.  I took it a second time and got a 5w4.  (completely different - I know) But during the time that I took the test, I was going through a very deep depression and really, just didn't know myself, or rather - didn't accept myself for who I was.  

When I read the book.  All the confusion cleared up, I most definitely was not a 5.  (I'm not exactly sure how I ever thought I was - but like I said, going through rough patch) I learned I was in fact a 9w8 - and without the book, I don't think I could've come to terms with that.  I was too busy viewing myself through everyone else's eyes, I didn't take the time to look through my own.  

In short - read the book.  You'll find what you're looking for.  Or, if not the book, at least read through all the types.  We're constantly growing and changing through every season of life.  Our true self can get distorted through different hardships and experiences.  So really, sometimes it just takes a bit longer to figure everything out.  I wish you the best :)"

But now I'm currently searching for a book to get me over the first life series... kinda dying here 

But that book is about the war between the two worlds in the afterlife, people that are *actually living* have to choose where they go after they die, and sign their souls over to one world.  People from the after life come down to earth and are hired to try and convince people to sign to their world.  It's super cool, and super dark, but features romance... so if you're not into that - 

\- ""His Dark Materials"" by Philip Pullman (super easy read lol) 

\- ""The lunar chronicles"" Marissa Meyer - (just one of my classic favorites)

\- ""The Testing"" trilogy by Joelle Charbonneau (if you love the hunger games!!!)

BreakUp,fca7oz6,t3_eggrzt,1577564303.0,"Look, I'm in your situation right now, so I know how hard this is; watching someone up and leave out of nowhere.  Leaving you in utter shock.  Losing not only someone you're in love with, but a best friend.  It's a feeling I can't really explain.  It's been 5 months since my break up, I was best friends with him for two years and we ended up dating for a little over 8 months.  I was so connected to him, we just, understood each other, and we got each other through some of the worst of times.  (I deal with a lot of mental health stuff as well, and he did too, he was just more outgoing, but that's why we kinda knew where each other in that way?)  He's still very close to all my friends, he just avoids seeing me, it's almost like he's ashamed of how he left me.  And he doesn't wanna own up to it, so he pretends like it never happened.  It's great.

BUT ENOUGH OF ME.  THIS IS ABOUT YOU. (im honestly depressing myself writing this all out lol)

I don't know your story completely, and you don't know mine.. but honestly, in your case, just be observant of how he's treating you.  It's harder on a different level losing someone who was just ""there"" through your dark periods, it's like losing a limb.  I'm glad you guys are still friends, but I'd leave the ball in his court... maybe just for a little while longer.

Ask yourself why he'd still deserves you, and his good qualities, but also remember the bad.  Remember the way he left you, and how bad that hurt.  Look this is absolutely normal for a breakup like this.  It takes soooo much time to get over him, or to stop thinking about him every day.  And yes, at first, (it takes many months) you aren't going to wanna be with anyone else.  I know I still don't.  But keep in mind that you are worth it, and you deserve someone who will put up with all the shit, and stick by you through thick and thin.  You deserve to find ""YOUR"" person, the one who you can't live without.  And maybe you think that's him, but he's the one who left.  And it sucks being hurt by the same person twice. (yes, I went back to my ex one time, yikes.)

Maybe talk to some people who know both of you, and get a second opinion.  If it get's to point where you just need to *""Know""* then ask him if he can talk sometime, tell him about what you've been feeling and ask him to be honest. Whether he gives you the answer you are looking for or not, you don't have to go on torturing yourself, or being confused about how everything went down.  It'd be opening that wound back up, but at least this time you can let it heal properly, right? It's gonna be the new year soon after all, (actually, **NEW DECADE**) better to go into it without all the baggage of an old relationship on your shoulders.  Look to get a fresh start.  New year new love, you know?  But hey, I don't know the full story, at all, who's to say things won't work out, for all I know, they will. and I'd be very very happy for you.  Relationships are hard, and there's always heart break, and you lose people along the way.  Do what you think is best, and no matter what, remember to guard your heart.

(if you ever get to a point where you're thinking about the good times with him, or missing him a lot, and it hurts.  Think of bad that happened, how you got hurt.  If you just focus on the good it's almost impossible to get over someone.)

I'm sorry this is so much, (I just like to write. lol.) or not the type of advice you're looking for.. But I wish you the best.  (And try not let him have too much power over your emotions, I don't know you, but everyone deserves to be loved and have the best, so that means you)

fantasywriters,fbw66ul,t3_eenm04,1577141864.0,"You need to give it more substance, I think huffpuffhigh laid it out beautifully, 

As a writer, an exercise I do (which I picked up from another writer haha) is to go back and read your work from a readers perspective and try and analyze whether or not it's engaging, or something you'd personally enjoy reading.  

Another thing, establishing the opening scene (opening image) is crucial.  Rather than talk about the environment around your character, show it.  Put a vivid image in your readers head that engages them, and makes them believe the world you're creating is real.  

Also, along with that, establishing goals, flaws, the major issue in the main character life (as huffpuffhigh said) is very important.  Why should we care about your character reaching his or hers goal? 

But I do think you have great material to work with, and maybe add more attachment to your characters companion before killing him, or kill him off later and give a reason for doing so.  Otherwise, yeah, just cut it out completely for it's a somewhat unnecessary add to the story line. 

Keep writing though :))) don't focus on edits yet, just put your ideas onto paper then worry about critique."
