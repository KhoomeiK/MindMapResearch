BTW thanks for sharing. You can do better, too, I did it. I was suicidal for over a decade. And I survived, I changed and I tried to get a different world view. Just get something positive on your mind every day, even the smallest things. One thing I realized is also, stop thinking about what you could accomplish or what others think of you, and take it on step by step. You don't have to be there for everybody, just for yourself.

Maybe you never lost someone through suicide, I did,. My brother said goodbye over to years ago. being suicidal myself it was the worst thing that could have rver happen to me, but I don't want to even imagine how it was for my parents.

TheCircleTV,fdkvgmj,t1_fdjtz62,1578511989.0,"I appreciate your ranking, and it makes a lot of sense to me. But I have different favorites to pick :)

1. It's shooby from day one, I like his nerdy and innocent but also truthful and kind hearted energy. Nothing comes between me and someone who has a heart of gold.

2. Is a little bit more difficult, because my opinion changes a bit episode by episode, but I would have to say Rebecca/Seaburn, too. Even if he's a catfish, he has the sweetest heart and still shows his personality through rebecca. He's also a good player, what I really like

3+4. I think Sammie and Joey are tied for me on this one, because I like their energies. Joey is my man and is the real deal, always telling how it is. Same with Sammie. There have been moment when I didn't know how to feel about her, but she's at least not playing around and is a strong women, what I like. She's someone I wouldn't even be that hurt about if she called me out on something, because she's genuine and true to hersef.

5th Has to be Sean, I like her honesty and energy and I'm exited to see more of her.

6th Chris would be number 6. Love him, would be a great friend for sure, but there's some moments where he's not critical enough for me, because, let's be honest, we all have people we have to say some things about, right. It's almost like he's a people pleaser, but it might also be his personality and his good heart. But I'm not sure.

7th Is Ed, love him and his mom. Haven't seen enough yet, but already interested. 

8th Is Bill, he seems like a really genuine, cool guy unfortunately he didn't get a lot of screen time yet and the connection to the others is missing. Want to see more. 

9th Last but not least it has to be Adam/Alex. I like his weird vibes but I hate the character he played the moment he came in, though I have to say, it seems like it changes. Didn't like the flirting with every girl. It made me FakeThrowUp like Sammie always does. But we'll see. Hope he can redeem himself fully

That's my final say, for now."
