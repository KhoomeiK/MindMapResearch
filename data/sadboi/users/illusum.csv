I remember shitting in a hole out in the field, getting into a cattle car one time, and being disappointed that the water we drank was warm and tasted fucking terrible. Room clearing with dummy grenades was fun. AT-4 training with a 9mm tracer round. Humping an M60E3 around in wet sand sticks out for some reason.

Got to MOS school, there were a few women there, went out with one for a bit. One of the other ones had like 25 dudes run a train on her one night. The backlash for that was incredible.
