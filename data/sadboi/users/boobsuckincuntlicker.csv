self,fil32yp,t1_fil1lu7,1582492607.0,"Varying depending upon the person. DBT has been proven to be most effective. But with any mental illness there isn't a definitive ""cure"", just treatments to help subside the symptoms. There's meds to curb it, there's support groups. An alcoholic isn't just cured because he stops drinking. Someone isn't depressed any more just because they take meds. Please educate yourself and stop with the hate and stigmatizing."

BPDsupport,fik8m7c,t1_fik83v3,1582475275.0,"Wtf? 

I never said *I* was taking in black and white. 

THIS OP is black and white thinking. 

OP even mentions making this post in a BPD flood state. 

But it is also offering the validation of toxic stigmatized mentality of those of us with BPD.

I disagree with validating people's toxic thoughts and attention seeking suicide. 

Idk who you are getting off diagnosing me, or why you continue to attack me when I feel this post is nothing more than someone seeking attention to validate their thoughts of suicide."
BPDsupport,fik7pzr,t1_fik7eue,1582474686.0,"Thank you for assuming my symptoms.
I disagree with suicide.
I disagree with making posts that urge people to validate their feelings towards not wanting treatment and suicide. 

There's no other context than that. 
And it's clearly black and white thinking.

If OP wanted help they could've stated more than toxic stigmatized thoughts."

BPDsupport,fik6a59,t1_fik5yz9,1582473729.0,If OP wanted to add more context to what they have meant they could have. But they didn't. And they haven't answered any other remarks others have asked about why they feel the way they feel. Therefore in my opinion this is a suicide validation post. And to me a suicide validation post is not something that belongs on any page anywhere.
BPDsupport,fik5qcf,t1_fik5e2t,1582473368.0,"I see this post as attention seeking or validating thoughts for suicide. 

I've been there but I'm also reaching out to a friend within my circle when I feel this way. I do NOT make this type of post on a public site of any kind. That shit can come back to haunt you. And if OP wanted to vent they could add more context instead of circle jerking around suicide. 

We've all been exhausted but this post is blatant suicide validation especially considering there is no added context. 

A body text of ""I'm exhausted"" is all it would have taken to make it not a suicide validation post. But instead it's just the whole idea of ""I don't want treatment"" and ""I want to die"" statements. 

Both very unhealthy and both very stigmatized and super triggering in a support page context."
BPDsupport,fik52ol,t1_fik4qas,1582472939.0,All I'm saying is posts like this without any context just helps to put blame on us as whole. This is a support page for what? Supporting people in their negatives to continue with their negatives? Or yet what OP might have hoped for was someone Supporting people to kill themselves and not live anymore???? Posts like this don't add any value to actually getting help or seeking support.
BPDsupport,fik3pqh,t1_fik3gl1,1582472017.0,"You added NO context to your post. 

You stated NO issues in the body of your post. 

Just ""I want to die, I don't want to get better"" the stigma around BPD is that we don't want to get the help. We're untreatable. There's alot of negatives that revolve around us and this post just makes those stigmas true. 

Why else make this post than just to seek attention? You want support then state maybe WHY you want to die and what the issues are????

Communication helps in relationships Soo much!

But he told me if he wanted to leave he'd be gone.

Get you a partner. 

Not a boyfriend.
Not a lover.

A partner. A companion. Ready and willing to step up when you need him but also stands up for himself. 
Someone to work with you. 

Co dependence is a thing with BPD too! 
Learning to let go of unhealthy attachments helps with the ILY/DLM mentality.

(From my comment on this thread cross posted to r/bpdrecovery)


Edit: also wanted to point out that if he keeps hurting you, you need to develop boundaries and clearly communicate them. 

When he crosses a line you put your foot down. 

If he's hurting you explain clearly how he's doing it AND ALSO provide a solution that you would like to see him take.

If he respects and loves you he will hear your boundaries and do his best to maintain them. 

But that also means you have to as well. 

You have to keep your own boundaries to yourself otherwise he might get the idea that if you let yourself slide, you'll let him slide too."

He probably still loves you and is suffering with BDD and is projecting. 
He wants you to be upset bc he wants you to fight for him, (reassurance) and is also probably subconsciously reaching out to you for help.

He probably feels you stronger than him, (the fact that you cried alone and came out strong) is a sign that he's probably looking to you for help. 

Maybe some therapy for the both of you. 

I get it, yeah 10 years is something you don't wanna let go. But it has been 10 years for a reason. 

Your love for him may not necessarily be fading but maybe you two are just getting hired. That's okay!

BPD,fgkqr1t,t3_eyunl7,1580871524.0,"Holy cow. I relate to this post so hard. Needed to write this first as when I opened and read I immediately began to type the following. 


The difference between BPD multiple personalities and DID multiple personalities, imo (inadr) is that we BPD personalities tend to go beyond and extend the emotion in a way that tempers who we were when the trauma happened.

 We do not become the personality such as how those with DID does since we do not see it as a whole other person entirely, more an extension of ourselves.

Sometimes the snap back to reality is so quick for me that I am then disassociative of what actually just happened. 
But I still feel the shadow me lingering within. 

It's horrifying. 
I hate the black out moments. 

As I read in these groups and make my own post and comments on trying to learn my triggers and I am now seeing that I have to then attempt to think beyond the emotion but more to who I am playing in that emotion to try to see what trauma happened to me when .


Life is a story. Our characters represent chapters. This book of our lives through, intricately written with riddles and rhymes bear a secret to help us through the bad times. 


I sorta enjoy my characters though. It's a fun way to escape and play a different me. Often times when I am alone. I used to do it out in public. 

I am too a jack of many trades.
And that can prove to be beneficial.
My Skills are valuable. 
And us with BPD are fast learners.

One day someone will take notice of our efforts.
We also have to as well. I am needing to be more comfortable with me. 
Maybe me is more than one side of me and that's okay. 
Who said I have to be just one role? 
That's boring. 

Also I highly recommend watching Orphan Black on Netflix. Tatiana Maslany plays many characters , sometimes in the same scene. 

It's so comforting to watch and if you're into acting then maybe take this as an inspiration. 

Playing with yourself is always fun 😉"

BPDrecovery,fgjz6zw,t3_ex6hlp,1580854274.0,My boyfriend doesn't fucking deserve me. I am having a really shitty day. He runs a company meanwhile I barely have a job and can't afford health insurance. He tells me I need to try harder. He helps me sometimes but he doesn't understand my struggles when he pushes me away to go be doing the things I lack. And he tells me I need to do stuff on my own but I get crippling almost all the time now. I want to be normal.
relationship_advice,fgjqqxc,t3_eyti5x,1580849542.0,"Can I also suggest start showering together? 
Tell her ways in which you like being washed, and maybe shell clue you in on how she washes herself. 
My bf and I do the whole ""here's how you clean a penis"" joke when we shower together. But it's really effective. It's fun. And also sexy. You'll find yourself getting it in more after a shower together. 
Atleast from my experience. 

She may also be suffering from some actual health issues that might need a doctor..

Check yourself too maybe you're using a lotion or something she's allergic to and is negatively reacting to it with poor odor. 

Sensitive subject make sure you have her favorite food afterwards."

BPD4BPD,fghetdr,t3_eygwjk,1580783243.0,"And fucking people think that were not doing anything to help ourselves. 

All I am doing is trying to overcome my past. 
My issues. 
I don't even acknowledge my past anymore bc I'm trying to move on and yet 

Everything happens on repeat. 

Get a job. Apply to 50 places. Call and follow up, no one hires me. ""Maybe it's bc you're not trying"". 

Goes to therapy to learn to cope. Therapist isn't fucking working bc they're only in it for themselves. Explain that you don't like your therapist to someone ""well maybe it's bc you're not trying"" 

Wake up start thinking positively. Go about the day. Something triggers you into overwhelming and crippling anxiety. Try to talk to someone about it ""wElL mAyBe ITs Bc yOuRe nOT TryInG""
 

I'm fucking done trying holy shit. 

All I seem to do is fail and fail and fail. 
Despite my best efforts.
Despite trying to fix my thoughts about the past. 
Controlling my emotions. 
Attempting to be better. 

And I just can't. 

I am stuck in a perpetual cycle of dispair from trying and failing. 

The toxic mentality of ""if you don't succeed try try again"" like 
When is the. Fucking shoe going to drop in my favor. 

I get that I am lucky in some regards. 
I have a good bf. I have a dad who helps support me. 
No one in my immediate family has died. 

But why is it that I have to fucking struggle with living day to day when I can't age myself past being a fucking 14 year old in my head. Hell I'm fucking turning 30 this year. I have so many talents. And I'm fucjing good and what I do. But still. Something. Fucking. Is. Wrong. 

And idk if it's even me any more. 
Like it's the people around me. 
The environment of my life is just pulling me down. 

I want out of this fucking place. I'm done being tortured."

BPD,fg56cjo,t1_fg4tr49,1580519377.0,"Just know that through death there is rebirth.
When I speak of killing myself, I speak of who that person is when I am in a distress. And what helps me is that to realize we have the ability to kill our negative thoughts. Our negative actions. Our negative sense of who we are. We are able to become reborn within ourselves. This also happens after the dark times when I'm able to speak of these positive feelings, but know that it is possible to die and still come out alive. 
This helps to cherish my bad thoughts bc effectively when we sleep who we were that day dies. 
When we wake up the next day we have the ability to start a new. 
Even though there are the dark shadows of yesterday's past they are there to remind us of where we came from. What we have to over come. 
The darkness helps us to see the light. 
Be strong my friend."
BPD,fg49mfo,t1_fg4767j,1580499082.0,"Lol seriously the whole ""what doesn't kill me makes me stronger"" phrase is true as fuck for me. 
I love the one where it's also like ""if my mental illness wants to take me out so badly my brain will have to shut itself down."" Or something along the lines of that. 
I know I'm here for a reason. 
I feel like I'm a connector. The glue.
Some point person to bring it all together somehow. 
It sometimes feels like I'm meant to bring clarity to people strugglling themselves. Which is why I love performance art. I know I have a story to tell, and I want to share. 

I developed a little coin phrase to kind of help translate my ideals of what I've discovered through my current journey. 
""Communication for education to understanding inevitable unity."" 
 Not sure how it relates currently. A little random blurb inserted bc I felt compelled to.

I've taken psychedelics before when I spent 2 weeks by myself at my grandma's beach trailer. Micro dosed 6 tabs over that time period. I absolutely love the self discovery. I abused the drug and was taught a lesson about respecting the drug but I am feeling compelled to try it again. My sister even mentioned it to me a couple weeks ago so I think I might have to go ahead and do it again. 

Its just always so scary bc of finding the right source, knowing how much to take. But I find myself enjoying it even if the devil's playground becomes a little too dark. I almost enjoy it.

Being a sober mind and attempting to fully feel the feelings is so hard when. Everyone you reach out to tries to cheer you up and so you have to show your strength for them. Being vulnerable and succumbing to it is embarrassing when in the wrong company. 

I'm learning to cope with myself again. And learning to find myself again. 

Thank you for being there! I love that I have found a good community outside of Facebook bullshit groups to find real support."
BPD,fg43o3p,t1_fg42em3,1580495485.0,"There's definitely some universal hand at work. Spiritual journey for sure. I just don't know where it's going. I should mention for context myself that I probably should have died last March. I was driving back across county and in the last 4 hours of my trip I was in 3 major car accidents, back to back, that I somehow managed to drive away from and make it back home. The PTSD I've suffered from it lasted well pretty much up until now. Im still being affected by it and learning to cope with what the hell I'm meant to do with my life. It feels like I want to give up and I probably should given that something's just aren't working but then of course my insane mind is like ""no you can make a change you can make it work"" and yet the outcome is always the same negative monster. I have been considering a medicated spiritual journey to talk to myself within. It's scary though I feel I need a trip sitter but I also want to do it by myself."
BPD,fg3y429,t3_ewm89v,1580492138.0,"I have a stupid crazy theory. 

Those of us with BPD are living in purgatory. 
We've escaped death so many times. Or so we thought. 
BPD was given To us one day when we woke up after escaping death for the final time. But we actually woke up in hell. 

I literally feel insane. Like. Trying and failing at everything I do. 
But being, pretty, talented, caring, etc is somehow the cursed mask people see as a put together person. They don't understand why or seem to see that I'm falling apart. 

Definitely feels like a simulation at times. 

The disassociation is horribly real."

I read an article I think it may help you narrow down what it is you may wanna do as far as a career.  
[The Modern Trap of Turning Hobbies Into Hustles](https://www.manrepeller.com/2019/02/trap-of-turning-hobbies-into-hustles.html?goal=0_ef12d21c8f-493f22216a-98418297&mc_cid=493f22216a&mc_eid=881d4a51c2&fbclid=IwAR28ctK3Hc9DdjHPfH5IrELeJv43CNo9iWhrhFA3sE8FZ2hVLXqYgND03YE )
Im currently struggling with that I want to do bc I'm so good at alot of things. 
I hate that talking about yourself is seen as negative but I'm fucking talented. I can sing, dance, make art, jewelry, cook, and so many more creative talents and yet I can't build a career out of it. I've been trying so hard bc art is what I love and I want to make a living at it but this article opened up alot of perspective. I hope it helps you too! 

Always here to talk too! I think Reddit is a great place to become vulnerable without the obligation to completely surrender yourself to someone. I mean this whole site is anonomyous and throw away accounts can be created for us to be invisible and rant and still have someone relate and care. I'm trying to be more open but also want to protect myself from naysayers or those self diagnosed fools who make us look bad."
BPDsupport,fg2urqk,t1_fg2qz7x,1580456776.0,"When he and I first started dating, we had already been friends for over a decade. I also moved in at the same time. And had alot of bad things happen to me, car accident, the aftermath and so on. 

From March to December I lived there. Things were great. But also really bad bc of us both struggling with our illnesses and being cursed with close quarters syndrome. We knew the love was there, and we were trying so hard to make it work.eventually I had to move out to save us. And it's been great for our relationship. We talk every day. The space is great for us bc it keeps me knowing my boundaries and when I truly need someone outside of my dysmorphic states. And I am able to respect his. We're basically not up each other's asses any more in the toxic ways. I couldn't have done alot of what I do after my whole life without him. 

Sometimes talking a step back to honor your commitment to respect boundaries while you evaluate what the core dysfunction is so that they may heal when you hurt is something I'm learning to do with him. He's able to cope with how I am when I become overwhelming and I in turn provide the same for him. It's super hard but we're slowly learning. I hope you two can make it through your tough times. ❤️"

But like it's every day that I am in a bad zone. 
Even when I'm with him it can turn into a bad time. 

It's so terrifying that it feels like I can never truly have what I want. 

I hate that I involuntarily hold myself back. 


He sticks with me through and when I come out of my spirals I'm so appreciate of him. I thank him. And know that when he's in my state I'm right there with him. It's just also hard bc my strength are weakened when it feels like I'm being attacked but we somehow both come out of it. 

I want to be better for both of us. We deserve it. 
Mostly I deserve it. Because I know that this isn't who I am.

Yeah I totally understand that I'm a victim which makes it even worse sometimes. Like I don't want to be apart of this. I never asked for it. And I suffer through it feeling the monster inside me destroying me. 

I have a really strong supportive bf who helps me when i get upset. I just am trying to be better than bringing this to him on the fucking regular. He reminds me every day that I'm not my disorder. It's hard to see in the moment of course.

And when people question my efforts it's even more debilitating. 


I'm lucky to have a partner be very supportive of what I have to endure, right now. 

It's terrifying to think I might one day make true the calling of leaving it all behind to hopefully start over somewhere new without a past. 

But even then, the thought of the potential guilt I would feel makes it all fall apart. 


It's so funny when I truly think about it. Like I MUST be going insane right? 
the cycle of hurt and dispair. Like I obviously do this to myself. I'm the one with the mental brain connectivity of a tuna fish. 

I also hate how I know that I have a fucking issue inside my head that was never given to me. I never sought it out, but get here it fucking in. 

""Living with BPD"" is false. BPD is living with me. An unwanted rude guest who won't fucking move out. And I obviously can't go anywhere. 

I just suffer day to day. I am trying to do more to push it away. To make it leave or stuff it into a corner like it's been doing to me. But I've got alot of PTSD and other bullshit to take care of as well.

I'm working on finding a place that makes me feel good. 
It's such a struggle.
I need a place where I can be and feel appreciated. But I also can't do too much, like being a face for a company while working on my own insecurities.

If you find yourself like me,
Maybe find what small tasks fit you and find a small community work environment? 
If you're in it for the hustle and grind then keep at it. 
If you need the money, keep your head down and write in a notebook when you feel explosive. Meanwhile job hunt.

Good luck!!"
