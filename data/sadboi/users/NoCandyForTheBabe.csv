BipolarReddit,fp8p00c,t3_gbwy4q,1588398408.0,"Your school probably has a disability resource center. You can contact them and they can help you get a letter of accommodation (or something similar.) You only need a psychiatrist to write a note to the disability office to get it approved. You can ask for things like extra time on tests and quizzes, quiet testing areas, excused absences and late school work. 

Generally the office will grant you some leniency and give you the accommodations before you get the doctor's note. I think this will almost definitely be the case because of our current extenuating circumstances. 

Then you have to let the teacher know you receive accommodations through disability but you don't have to be specific. Whenever I need to miss class I just email them ""due to my disability I will be unable to complete my assignment on time."" In my experience even the meanest teachers turn nice. Official disabilities through the school are something they can't fuck with.

Hope this helps! Good luck and take care of yourself! 

Tl;dr: Contact the disability resource at your school."

Tomorrow is my birthday, but I'm stuck in my room because I'm contagious. I know it will be really hard. My mom is going to make me a care package, though, and I'm looking forward to that!"

ADHD_partners,fkmu8na,t1_fkmb86i,1584340268.0,"I've been having this exact same issue with my partner and the election! I just posted about it recently.
One of the pieces of advice I was given was to make them talking about it not fun anymore. So not being responsive and not interacting with them while they're going on about it. It felt really harsh at the time and I even told my partner that that's what the suggestion I got was. But, I've been doing it and he knows that's what I've been doing when I shut down on him. It makes him kind of sad, but honestly it's calmed down a lot. We've started to have conversations about other things!"
ADHD_partners,fjxznk3,t1_fjxv3k4,1583686900.0,"Yeah, I didn't think of a Facebook group. I'll see if I can help him find one! I know he's tried on reddit a little bit and tries on him own timeline ad nauseam. 

The problem is he likes to ""debate"" people as well, and a group that agrees with him won't give him that. He also won't leave the house unless he absolutely has to, so he can't find anything in person, which is really frustrating.

When it happens to me I make sure I tell my boyfriend what's going on even if I don't feel like communicating.

Also your last three posts talk about how you are on lexapro, which is an SSRI, which can cause numb feelings."

UIUC,erb1y4w,t1_eraw365,1560658736.0,"That's interesting, because I was involuntarily committed to OSF and didnt like it as much as the Pavillion. It could have a lot to do with what the person is expecting to get out of the facility. Recovering from mental health issues has a lot to do with the mindset a person has. You cannot recover if you don't want to.

I also know that the mental health and drug abuse facilities at the Pavillion are separate and on different floors. 

On another note that is an awful thing for someone to say and I hope that person was reported. 

I am also very glad for your boyfriend. It is a hard and shitty road and takes a lot of courage."
UIUC,eraqfie,t3_c13ihh,1560650411.0,"I have, actually. It is definitely not a bad place and the food is decent. Spending a week or so in a facility was one of the best choices I ever made. Being stuck feels bad for the first few nights, but it gets easier quickly. Then it starts to feel good to be removed from the real world. You get a break. 
There are activities, groups, books, and movies, as well as a really strong feeling of togetherness amongst the people who've been admitted. I honestly think that sense of community is what helped me the most.
Depending on your money situation, go to the Pavillion instead. OSF is good and will keep you safe, but the Pavillion is privately owned and has better counseling and staff. 
Feel free to PM me."
