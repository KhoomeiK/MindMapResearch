The police investigating the murder stuck to that. The animal stuff has never been proven to be him, as clear as it is to lay people it‚Äôs not sufficient for evidence of a crime. If there are any authorities investigating the animal cruelty, which I don‚Äôt think there actually are because there isn‚Äôt enough direct evidence in those cases, they may want to identify the extra set of hands but likely consider it too difficult and a dead end. It‚Äôs an interesting speculative question, and I‚Äôm sure other web sleuths have some interest. However, given how many years have passed and how transient the relationship likely was (he found the animals on Craigslist mostly, he probably connected with that person the same way), there‚Äôs not a lot of hope for identifying the person based on the hands. There may be specific animal cruelty taskforces, but given their limited resources and the abundance of cruelty that happens daily, they are probably more focused on current cases.
