I ended up staying for 3 weeks. I always had suspicions that I was type 2, but I had been shot down before when bringing it up with a psychiatrist (I presented as well put together but was extremely depressed with hypomania). I‚Äôm currently on lamictal and have had success with it. Lithium and zyprexa killed me; they stabilized me but then took my personality, processing, my confidence and my sense of who I was. Coming to terms with being type 1 has been really hard for me also. It‚Äôs reassuring to know that I‚Äôm not alone in this. I believe it‚Äôll get better but it‚Äôs going to take some work.

From there I did a search in my area and read all the profiles until I found someone who I thought had what I was looking for. In my case I wanted someone specializing in bipolar disorder with lots of years of experience, especially someone who took a holistic approach. It took me about two weeks to finally call and set up the appointment but I did it and now I‚Äôm so glad I did. However, if I had gone to that first appointment and decided I didn‚Äôt like the guy, I would have found someone else the same way and tried again.

bipolar,f80z6rc,t1_f80ymfe,1574143193.0,"Fuck is right. I‚Äôm so sorry that happened to you. 

I was taken in as a section 12 against my will and deemed a danger to myself and others. I was ushered around between 4 hospitals (two ERs and 2 inpatient) when all was said and done. In the first inpatient another patient got me all hyped up (his roommate was on suicide watch but staff was blowing it off) and we locked ourselves in the ‚Äúday room‚Äù. The ordeal lasted a few hours and happened at night, so since then I cant sleep without meds and have major anxiety about going to sleep since it was such an issue. In the second inpatient I was injected against my will three times with Ativan at night while repeatedly asking for something else because it made me dissociate (blacked out but still interacting with people and making a fool of myself). But who listens to the mental patient? Just no autonomy over our own bodies. Eventually it got taken out of my plan of care but fuck, it took a week of fighting to get there before someone listened to me.

The hospital will get you stabilized on meds so that‚Äôs a positive, and you‚Äôre right, you‚Äôll have to deal with getting the new psychiatrist once you get out. The provider I was seeing prior to my hospitalization was the person I went back to right after (when they start planning your discharge they‚Äôll have appointments set up for you with your psych)."
bipolar,f80xvs7,t1_f80xk87,1574141832.0,"No, not at all, I was afraid to do it honestly but my therapist put it to me like this: You are paying a person for a service and are unsatisfied with that service. You can continue to be unhappy or find someone who will work with you. 
Sometimes we just don‚Äôt click with our providers and that‚Äôs totally ok. I once had another provider who just didn‚Äôt ‚Äúget me‚Äù and I was too nervous to switch. This time I did and it made all the difference. You don‚Äôt have to even address the issue directly. Just find the new provider, try em out, and get all the releases signed for your records from the old doctor. They‚Äôll get the hint."
bipolar,f80xaae,t3_dyfeor,1574141237.0,"I think you should find a new psychiatrist honestly. I had one who basically told me to ‚Äúshut up and take the pills‚Äù when I‚Äôd tell her all about the awful side effects from meds I was experiencing. I found a new psychiatrist (an MD) through a Psychology Today search online who specialized in holistic treatment for bipolar disorder and he‚Äôs helped me immensely. You can‚Äôt pour from an empty cup, so running yourself into the ground and then putting your family first is a mistake. Putting your health first above all else is the priority here, and if you‚Äôve reached a crisis then you should consider getting immediate help. When I went into the hospital they basically coached me to call some hotlines and reach out to mental health professionals first before calling a hospital, so maybe try that route as well. Long term though I‚Äôd suggest a new doc who will listen to you and take you seriously."
