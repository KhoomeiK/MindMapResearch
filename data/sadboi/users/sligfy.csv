>Although sometimes I think about conditioning and whether fear is the correct framing for some of the things that I do.

Yup. Fear isn't quite the right word but it feels exactly like fear in my body. Therapists always ask what I'm afraid of happening, and I genuinely don't know. I just have this constant lizard brain sense of ""don't fucking do it!""

> When I think about dating for example there is a lot of fear there about being vulnerable and getting rejected but then there is also **this strong feeling of I honestly don't care about going through the motions.**

Totally. And now that I think about it, disinterest isn't the perfect word for this feeling either. *Repulsion* toward the motions is perhaps more accurate, for me at least. In theory I am interested in my career. I am interested in having a love life. But the motions are beyond disinteresting to me, they're actively repulsive. Can you relate?

Do you have any other words that describe this vague sense of fear/disinterest/repulsion/""I just don't care."" It's interesting how much specific words can help us gain and develop understanding."

phenibut,fozmrg2,t1_fozk66g,1588193261.0,"I'd definitely recommend getting powder from a reputable vendor instead of extracts. Poorer quality ""tudei"" kava can cause some issues, and extracts are often made from this, since it's way cheaper. I think you also get more of the good stuff per buck from raw powder, AND the ritual of making it is pretty satisfying. 

Be forewarned that it ain't cheap, it doesnt make you high, and it tastes gross. Its impacts are super subtle but I've noticed it absolutely destroys any desire for compulsive drinking. I also sense overall improvement of my gaba feels. I have been sleeping better and using way less of my gabapentin prescription. The general sense of calmness is astounding (but staying at home all the time also has something to do with that.) So it's worth it to me. I also realize how much alcohol and phenibut negatively impact my body and mind (hangover / comedown effects mostly.)

Anyway, cactus Kava and Kalm With Kava are good places to start. Try a KwK sampler pack. I think you can still get on Amazon. 

Start with traditional prep. r/kava will tell you how, but it's basically like making tea except you use more powder than a normal tea bag and have to knead it by hand to get out the kavalectones. I typically use 1/3 cup of root powder, do a total of 3 rinses, and end up with 2 quarts. KwK strainer bags suck but Cactus strainer bags are awesome. The strainer bag you use has a big impact on how it comes out. 

2 quarts is my typical daily dose, and I start drinking first thing in the morning. (Gotta drink on an empty stomach.) The disgusting taste improves if you let it get cold in the fridge first. Add a little milk or other fat source for max absorption. 

Try trad prep first to make sure your stomach can tolerate but there are ways to make it stronger. I put kava and water in the blender together and then strain. I also freeze the bag after 2nd rinse and before 3rd because that helps make it stronger too."
phenibut,fozb2p8,t3_gad7nu,1588187678.0,"I would very very strongly recommend you consider kava instead. Phenibut will cause tolerance and withdrawal before you get past the tolerance and withdrawal of alcohol. It's similar to if not worse than trying to use xanax to get off booze. Don't do it.

Kava is one of if not the only non addictive gabaergic compounds. The drinking style is also more similar to alcohol than phenibut is. 

I wasn't even trying to quit drinking, but my kava habit quickly replaced my long time habit of several beers before bed every day."

Send me an email telling me how you will give more energy if you want to keep working with mr.

The week before, he told me to read The Stranger by Camus once it became clear that I'm still totally stuck and spinning my wheels. (The Stranger is perhaps the #1 piece of literature about someone who finds everything completely empty and meaningless, just like me. I'm just not interested.)

I read it in between sessions and signed onto talk to him, when he went on this rant for 10 minutes and canceled the rest of the session.

Fuck yes. I proudly shamed one of my formerly favorite nootropic vendors yesterday for price gouging masks. Vendors need to know that pitch forks are fucking out for those who try to profiteer off of tragedy. (See my post history if you're curious.)

Price gouging fortunately *is* illegal, but I don't fully understand the law by any means. Laws are mostly in effect by state (in the US at least). I encourage you to report and shame price gouging wherever you see it. I think price gouging laws will really come into strong effect once there is an emergency declaration."

_____________________________

The top White House official responsible for leading the U.S. response in the event of a deadly pandemic has left the administration, and the global health security team he oversaw has been disbanded under a reorganization by national security adviser John Bolton.

The abrupt departure of Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer from the National Security Council means no senior administration official is now focused solely on global health security. Ziemer’s departure, along with the breakup of his team, comes at a time when many experts say the country is already underprepared for the increasing risks of a pandemic or bioterrorism attack.

Ziemer’s last day was Tuesday, the same day a new Ebola outbreak was declared in Congo. He is not being replaced.

Pandemic preparedness and global health security are issues that require government-wide responses, experts say, as well as the leadership of a high-ranking official within the White House who is assigned only this role.

“Health security is very fragmented, with many different agencies,” said J. Stephen Morrison, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “It means coordination and direction from the White House is terribly important. ”

The personnel changes, which Morrison and others characterize as a downgrading of global health security, are part of Bolton’s previously announced plans to streamline the NSC. Two members of Ziemer's team have been merged into a unit in charge of weapons of mass destruction, and another official's position is now part of a unit responsible for international organizations. White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert, who had called for a comprehensive biodefense strategy against pandemics and biological attacks, is out completely. He left the day after Bolton took over last month.

NSC spokesman Robert Palladino said Wednesday the administration “remains committed to global health, global health security and biodefense, and will continue to address these issues with the same resolve under the new structure.”

Another administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly, acknowledged it was only one of many administration priorities. “In a world of limited resources, you have to pick and choose,” he said. “We lost a little bit of the leadership, but the expertise remains.”

Ziemer is a well-respected public health leader who was considered highly effective leading the President’s Malaria Initiative under George W. Bush and Barack Obama before joining the NSC last year. While Palladino said he left “on the warmest terms,” an individual familiar with the specifics behind the reorganization said “he was basically pushed out. He struggled to preserve himself and the integrity of his team, and he failed.”

His exit comes against the backdrop of other administration actions critics say have weakened health security preparedness, including dwindling financing for early preventive action against infectious disease threats abroad.

The new Ebola outbreak is in northwest Congo. Only two cases have been confirmed, but the World Health Organization reported Thursday another 30 probable and suspected cases of the deadly hemorrhagic fever. Of those, 18 already have died.

Congolese and international health officials say they hope to control the outbreak quickly, but some health officials worry about its potential to become more serious and spread because of its location in a town upriver from the densely populated capital of Kinshasa.

This week, the administration released a list of $15 billion in spending cuts it wants Congress to approve. Among the targets is $252 million in unused funds remaining from the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic in West Africa that killed more than 11,000 people, far exceeding the combined total cases reported in about 20 previous outbreaks since the 1970s.

The White House proposal “is threatening to claw back funding whose precise purpose is to help the United States be able to respond quickly in the event of a crisis,” said Carolyn Reynolds, a vice president at PATH, a global health technology nonprofit.

Collectively, warns Jeremy Konyndyk, who led foreign disaster assistance at the U.S. Agency for International Development during the Obama administration, “What this all adds up to is a potentially really concerning rollback of progress on U.S. health security preparedness.”

“It seems to actively unlearn the lessons we learned through very hard experience over the last 15 years,” said Konyndyk, now a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development. “These moves make us materially less safe. It’s inexplicable.”

The day before news of Ziemer’s exit became public, one of the officials on his team, Luciana Borio, director of medical and biodefense preparedness at the NSC, spoke at a symposium at Emory University to mark the 100th anniversary of the 1918 influenza pandemic. That event killed an estimated 50 million to 100 million people worldwide.

“The threat of pandemic flu is the number one health security concern,” she  told the audience. “Are we ready to respond? I fear the answer is no.”

Coronavirus,fj9rtpm,t1_fj9qdum,1583157989.0,"I disagree. Teach people to give their masks to medical professionals who desperately need them to treat upcoming community spread. Without masks hospitals will shut down when we most need them. The benefit for medical professionals having these masks is far, far greater than the benefit of individual preppers having them. Think about it - the people who are hoarding masks are the same people who are hoarding food. These people won't need to leave their house. And they won't need masks at home. Surrender those masks to those who most need them!

But we collectively have enormous need for our medical professionals to leave their house and go to work. 

But this is 'Murrica, and I'm skeptical that we will learn to care for the community over the individual in time."
Nootropics,fj8trha,t1_fj8cei9,1583122007.0,Haha. I didn't expect that of the mods either. But I did honestly get that message. If for no other reason than shaming a shady vendor it still felt worth asking people to copy and share the post.
Nootropics,fj8242l,t1_fj81upd,1583103416.0,"Agreed. The limited supply of both medical and ""non-medical"" N95 masks belongs in the hands of medical professionals, regardless of how much consumers are willing to pay."
phenibut,fj7xurj,t1_fj7vm0m,1583100666.0,"🤘🤘 out of curiosity, and since we're on a phenibut sub, where else do you like to order phenibut?"
phenibut,fj7trcg,t1_fj7tekc,1583098121.0,"YIKES! Thanks so much for pointing this out and also for checking to verify. My link *was* broken, and I've corrected it. Correct link is also [here](http://imgur.com/a/ySnHEWz).

I wonder why you didn't get the email. At least one other commenter on my post at r/nootropics has also received the email (and has posted the weak excuse he got back from Liftmode.)"
phenibut,fj7tazq,t1_fj7sq4z,1583097838.0,"I wasn't commenting about their drug prices, but about Liftmode price gouging scarce face masks.

I don't know about phenibut prices, but consider Hard Rhino. They advertised on reddit for a while, and I recall that their owner was an active and helpful redditor. They have HCl and FAA."
Nootropics,fj7t0lv,t1_fj7sp1q,1583097660.0,I think you got the main reason right. They just want to cash in on the crisis. I also suspect that Liftmode knows their customers are generally high anxiety and therefore more likely to panic buy an overpriced and ineffective mask than the average person is.
Nootropics,fj7rw4c,t1_fj78lxy,1583096944.0,"Thanks. I agree. Sorry, for some reason I didn't understand what you meant before."
phenibut,fj7rrfm,t3_fc0djj,1583096860.0,Be aware that LiftMode is price gouging their customers by trying to sell ineffective N95 masks at 15x the market price. See my post history for details. I don't recommend that you or anyone support LiftMode.
Nootropics,fj7n6u9,t1_fj7jqaj,1583094040.0,"Thanks for sharing this. I totally agree that price gouging their anxious customers is a terrible way to ""barely break even"" on their... charity?

Even if what they say is true, they are *still* diverting significant volumes of masks from the medical professionals who need them most. I'm sure their loved ones and suppliers are fine people, but are these really the people who most need to take from our collectively very limited supply of masks?

>We have also donated masks of course to our suppliers who need the masks to restart their production in China, as well as to our own Staff and Production Team, and donated as well to all of our loved ones.

Tl;dr - thanks for sharing, but still... **Fuck Liftmode**"
phenibut,fj7ancx,t1_fj79hoe,1583088915.0,"It's clear what's up. Liftmode is opportunistically price gouging.

I think they will be more responsive to outrage on social media, loss of sales, and my complaint to my state's Attorney General than a polite email."
