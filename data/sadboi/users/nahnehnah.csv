You don't have to perform a task just because someone else wishes so. You are not simply responsible from someone else's thoughts about your ""performance"".  Intimacy is simply irrelevant from an erection and I would guess constantly worrying about not getting one would not help at all. There are lots of other people who also does not like pressuring people to perform or being pressured into it. I would not say there is anything wrong with you, or your worries are irrelevant, but know that there are people that would like to be intimate with you despite your condition.

You simply cannot find the ""happiness within"" if you constantly forced to live secluded due to anxiety or whatnot. People need people and when i say people need people it doesn't mean that people need other people to give such useless wisdom. 

People lost connection, people do not talk to each other anymore, people simply do not engage in physical contact and people prefer not to be around people unless it is absolutely necessary. And there are some people convinced it is a way to live. Well, surprise it is not. People basically should be able to talk when they want to, speak their minds freely, ask when curious, touch when their feelings are mutual and get into fights if they wish so. Not sit in an empty room ""meditate their way out"" by actively changing nothing.

It is only human to want someone else, and there are lots of other people who wish so. Hope you do find someone."

About the approximation issue, it appears counter intuitive to a math major at first but there's whole approximation theory to be studied for it to become intuitive. It is not that i would study approximation theory just to get used to the calculations in electeodynamics, just it is good to keep in mind. Yet, there are some fields of math that I also find counterintuitive such as set theory etc. 

Understanding approximation ansatzs of electeodynamics is not an issue stemmed from being indulged in the math discipline. It is just that you need more practice.

Also anyone who thinks on math/phys double major, it doesn't necessarily mean that you will be able to use the tools you learn at math classes right away. Sometimes the merging of concepts occur at higher levels of education and research. You may take advanced courses in partial differentiatal equations and may still struggle filling an exam paper in electeodynamics. It is not only common but also expected to happen at some point. 2 years is not a long time to become comfortable in using tools of other disciplines interchangeably. You will get there."
