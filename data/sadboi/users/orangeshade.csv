Lack of motivation sucks, and annoyingly, behavioral activation (doing the things you don't want to do anyway) is one of the best treatments for depression. It's kind of like the chicken and the egg- you need motivation to get un depressed, but depression makes you lose motivation. It's an uphill battle and a big fight, and I think feeling ""lazy"" is a common symptom of depression.
