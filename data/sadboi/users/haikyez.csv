schizoaffective,fikr0i3,t3_f89e7k,1582485611.0,"My premorbid phase occurred from ages 8-16 with possible areas of stability. Prodromal phase at 17, then my first psychotic phase at age 17 for a few weeks that tapered back into a prodrome that gradually ramped up from 18-20. I had a severe psychotic break at 21.

I had severe anxiety and depression and read on the Guardian about psychedelics helping with end-of-life anxiety. I was introduced to them in my early teens but never partook.

Psilocybin reset my depression and anxiety but I never integrated what learned and refused to be myself. A few months after this I did LSD, which skyrocketed me into an active phase. I had no help and was a hot-mess believing my auditory hallucinations were my friends attempting to communicate with me. I withdrew myself from society at that point because it was too stressful to deal with. There are additional experiences of ""chasing the white rabbit."" but nothing was learned because again, I had failed to integrate what I learned while in a different perspective. 

What I've learned from these drugs is that we are all the same exact being; just seperated through biology and conditioning. Regardless of how horrible your life is, it's repairable. The only choice you have in life is to work or you wither. Every miniscule to macro thing you take in, how you let others treat you, how others treat you, will always effect you. Basically epigenetics or rather ""your thoughts have interta."" is how I like to put it.
They've also allowed me to be able to fight delusions and to accept the voices without antipsychotics. Although this took a lot of time of stagnation and going through a three month long episode that allowed me to accepting my condition. The hallucinations do not have an actual part to play in reality. So why allow them to control you regardless of how rancid they can be?

You see life as the archetypical human before there was technology. This allows you to think and re-evaluate your life and shape it in the way you want it. Your brain being interconnected or the 'high' allows you to realize that you that you as an individual have the power of influence simply by existing and leading your life. 

A psychedelic has never put me in a mental hospital. I do not think they are like playing with fire like everyone warns you. There is an insane amount of disinformation and fear put out against these medicines. If there was accurate education about the mind and these materials,  initial psychotic experiences could be such a joke to deal with. Blaming hallucinogens or any drug for your schizophrenic subtype is akin to blaming a peanut for eating one when you have an unknown peanut allergy."
