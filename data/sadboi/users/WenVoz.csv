EatingDisorders,f6jw1wf,t3_drfx5c,1572901079.0,I donâ€™t have any advice per se. I have been in your predicament.  It helped me to learn that you cannot control what they say only your response. If your response is being resistant to maintaining a healthy weight...remember they are projecting their insecurities on you. Try to minimize contact. Natacha Oceane says the least interesting thing about you is the way you look! I have been battling this for 30 years now! I wish my family and yours would have taught me that instead!! You are worth more than you think! Best.
