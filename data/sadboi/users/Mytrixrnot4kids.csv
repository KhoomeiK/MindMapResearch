They just cut his hours at work though so money is tight.  We were in the process of moving and renovating a house when this all happened.  My husband was working 55 hours a week so work on the house has been slow.  I just looked at a huge mound of dirty dishes and was moaning about being sick of hand washing so many dishes and why couldn't my husband bring over the dishwasher.  Then I realized how lucky we were to have food to eat to make those dirty dishes.  Our house is far from perfect but it is warm.  We sleep on an air mattress but it is better than the street.  We are so lucky and I need to count our blessings.
