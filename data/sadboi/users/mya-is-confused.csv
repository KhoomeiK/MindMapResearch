Cause 800 wouldn't give you enough nutrients.

And you're right, too restrictive eating could lead to binging again, but also try to identify the problem. Did you binge because of an emotion (boredom, sadness, etc.)? Can you change what you do next time you feel that emotion?"

Eating more food for less calories is the key here, that's why the sub is called 1200 is plenty, because you can make 1200 plenty by eating volume foods and structuring how you eat to have 1200 calories and feel satiated. (At least, that's how I perceive the community as)

In terms of post workout meals, many people will tell you to eat it 30 minutes after to feed your muscles (something like that) to help build them. It depends on your workout though, and idk much about kick boxing. 

Not eating back exercise calories isn't a rule you have to follow, at the end of the day if you're at a deficit overall, you will lose weight over time. 

To find filling meals, you can check out r/volumeeating for some ideas, where you will see meals of maximum volume for minimum calories. Also, more protein and fiber can help you to feel more full. You can also find some low calorie snacks to eat throughout the day that will help you feel satiated. 

Honestly, everyone in the 1200isplenty community eats differently, and there's no guidelines or rules as to how you should do it. Just find what works for you, it'll take some time but once you find meals and an exercise routine that works for you, it'll get easier. 

Here's a what I ate today is like if you wanted some examples:

Breakfast: none, I also don't feel like eating breakfast, and that's okay. I usually wake up too late for it anyways.

Lunch: pb and j sandwich (about 300)

Snack: fruit (about 150)

Post workout snack: Greek yogurt (100)

Snack: fiber one brownie and milk (190)

Dinner: rice with chicken and vegetables, soy sauce, etc. (About 400)

Dessert: cake piece (250)

I know foods on the list of the top 20 sirt foods from this link I just searched up: https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/sirtfood-diet#section1

Are relatively healthy. Dark chocolate has benefits that can be stress reducing, appetite suppressing, good source of antioxidants, etc. I heard a million times that coffee and green tea boost your metabolism and make you perform better in the gym. 

And of course there's lots of fruits and veggies on that list which we know are healthy. 

I think it's a mix of that they're enjoyable to you and all the health benefits that research shows about these foods. 

For me, some foods that make me feel best are:
Greek yogurt with fruit, dark chocolate, peanut butter, cereal, oatmeal.

I think the reasons they're all relatively healthy is that once we start introducing more natural foods that our bodies originally crave, we start to feel good eating them since they supply our bodies with proper nutrients.

I saw this post on Instagram once (can't find the link but remembered it) about how hard it was to be a woman. Date a few guys? You're a slut. Don't date? No one likes you. Make-up? Not natural.

Honestly, why can't we as women just be women? It's sad that we're constantly criticized, and often it's women criticizing women.

And yes, you have more snacks, but they're not going anywhere, and you don't have to eat all of them at once because you just ate one. 

I've seen some other people on Reddit talk about how there are some foods where they really can't control themselves around so they don't keep them in their houses. Instead, they find foods they can eat portions of that are still satisfying and for a good calorie amount. 

Maybe you can try sugar free jello? I saw some packs are 5-10 calories each so you can eat a lot of it without feeling guilty"
1200isplenty,fppvhxa,t3_gevqg4,1588809957.0,"It's okay to eat over your calories sometimes, we all go over at some point. 

Don't punish yourself by working out more, you don't need to feel guilty for being human

Try preplanning what you're going to eat. What I do is figure out what snacks I want in my day (ex. Fiber one brownie + ice cream = 190) and just make sure everything else works around it. That way I can enjoy what I like while staying in my calorie range. 

You can also portion out things like popcorn into Ziploc bags so that you know exactly how much you're eating, which will help you to not go out of control

Don't worry, just get back to your calorie range tomorrow and keep working on it and you'll lose weight!"
1200isplenty,fppj6xq,t3_getedl,1588803261.0,"I agree with a lot of what you're saying, like the building muscle and more exercise part.

But my TDEE is only 1400 calories, my BMR is 1100 and I burn about 300 calories through my workouts. 

So if I eat 1200, then I will be at a 200 calorie deficit per day. And a deficit is what you need to lose weight, of course. I will already have slow weight loss, and if I increase my calories id have to exercise even more which would take up too much time. 

I think your theory for the restrict binge cycle is true when people eat under 1200 calories, your body will want more. 

But I think some people who have a similar TDEE to me and are eating 1200-1300 calories might binge eat because of psychological reasons. Like, if they really want a cookie but dont eat it to stay in the 1200 calorie range. Or if they eat high calorie foods like 1200 calories of just cake and chips. 

That's why in this sub you see people posting foods that still seem like treats for lower calories: it's volume eating. In my experience volume eating and eating foods I like helps me to not feel deprived which is why I don't have a binging problem. 

Also, with the volume in things like vegetables and good protein sources, our bodies will feel full and won't have to resort to wanting to binge. 

I think 1200 really can be plenty, given you eat in volume and move around your calories to fit other treats you want to incorporate.

Edit: also, in terms of increasing our calories relating to our bodies moving more, I don't think it's true. Some people will eat a lot of calories and not want to move an inch. Things like fidgeting and pacing around during a call for NEAT is more of a subconscious thing, and if one wanted to increase that they'd have to consciously make that decision."
WeightLossAdvice,fppdx8m,t3_gesjmq,1588800517.0,"If you don't want to eat another meal because you're genuinely full, you can get those extra calories through a table spoon of peanut butter, some extra sauce on your salad, or some extra nuts and seeds.

Here's my experiences: 
1. I confided in this guy for everything after he got me to open up the first time. He knew everything about me, and how much I went through. He confessed to me and I did as well, things were going ok. But he was also confused about his feelings. He ended up telling me he didn't have feelings for me anymore and friend zoning me. So I thought, okay, I love being friends anyway. But he ended up ghosted me. It hurt a lot, but I have learned my lesson. He didn't really care that much about me, and once he learned all about me, he just left. Some people are cruel like that. But if the girl you like truly is your friend, she wouldn't do that.

2. A guy friend I've been close with for a long time has been dating my friend for a really long time. I liked him before they started dating, and I confessed to get it off my chest. I confessed while they were dating, and they still are dating. It was just to finally get it out there, and he was cool with it. We are still close friends to this day. So, I know he truly cares about me and am glad we are friends.

Wouldn't it be better to know if she is really cares about you? Confessing will help you find out. If she doesn't, it'll hurt, it's the harsh truth, but it's better to get over it earlier than to keep being lead on and hurt by it.
