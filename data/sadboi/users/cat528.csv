raisingkids,fnt6swa,t1_fnrd22w,1587235719.0,i agree pay her $10 an hour to do work around the house and then if she slacks on pace so she can pay you back faster cut it down a dollar every time you catch her doing it

stories,fmypm2s,t3_fxy0ev,1586492116.0,i was a heavy smoker from ages 12 to 18 i smoked regular and e cigarettes what got me to stop was when i saw how it was affecting my body. it started with a thick yellow mucus coming from my nose/throat/lungs. Then i had a constant non stop cough causing more mucus to come up that was now a deep yellow sometimes with brown in it. i began to lose a lot of weight (at one point i lost 30lbs in 3 months) just from the smoking. and the final symptom that got me to stop was every so often i would blow black out of my nose. over a year later now and everyone of those symptoms stopped i feel healthier and look it too. you canâ€™t force your friend to make a decision but read this list of symptoms with her and maybe sheâ€™ll see how much sheâ€™s affecting her body. because whether she likes it or not she still has a future and her decisions now are going to affect her later whether or not she wants to live in the moment. stay safe out there i hope i was able to help.
