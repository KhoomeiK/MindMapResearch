Be careful about blaming the alcohol on the abuse.  That can lead you into a dark pit where you start blaming all your problems on others and lose the ability to take responsibility for your own life and your own choices.  Don’t learn to feel helpless or it will destroy you.

Of course try to extract yourself from the abusive situation if and when you have any options.  Sounds like it could literally kill you if you don’t get away eventually.  

If you need help, and it sounds like you do, you gotta ask for it because the desire to help yourself has to start from you.  No one can help you quit if you aren’t committed to getting better.  You gotta find someone you can trust.  Very few people at that level of consumption can just cut back to healthy levels all on their own.
