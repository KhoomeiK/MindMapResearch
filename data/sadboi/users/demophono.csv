Does your area have designated leaf pickups?  If so, could it be that they pick up on your side before his side and he just wants them out of the way so they don’t blow around for a week?"

CovIdiots,fqnqs1t,t1_fqn073x,1589499671.0,"I am as angry as you are about it.  Fuck!  I live in NY and i see these cunts all over the place not wearing them.   Workers, runners, old fucks, young fucks.  My city is giving away masks and there are fucking billboards everywhere that say cover your face in public but these fucking shitbag fucks are too goddamn fucking selfish to care.

Edit: I am no longer quite this angry.  I was caught up in the moment after a stressful day and came here to vent.   I  have overdue bills and stress from family things and plenty of other stuff going on.  It is tough but I have to be better than my own petty rage.  I care because these assholes have family members who care about their stubborn, confused sibling/parent/partner that they may unnecessarily lose."
mentalhealth,fqhs1rg,t3_gixjr8,1589383307.0,FWIW I just had this idea of adding a couple of those camping hand warmers.  They last for hours and could be like a point of warmth to focus on and help your mind and body stay connected.
mentalhealth,fqhmyjl,t3_gipvmw,1589380281.0,Right back to you!  Thank you!
mentalhealth,fqhmoj7,t3_giznxu,1589380116.0,"It sounds like you already did the hardest part in reaching out.   Compared to months or years of being affected by mental health issues, try to remind yourself that going forward won’t be so bad.  Maybe you have some fear of what is going to happen next, and so the anxiety and inner-criticisms you are telling yourself seem extra loud.  You waited for a long time before you made this decision to help your self. The pain of accepting it and the stress of admitting your struggles have been sitting inside of you for a long time, too.  It will be painful but it seems that you know what is right for you.   

Meds can take weeks to build up in your system, and can be a lengthy and difficult ‘trial-and-error’ process.  You wont feel better instantly and you may even have a few side effects that are unpleasant.  Your doctors office will know the right way to conduct the appointment, so just follow their instructions.  Try to give yourself a little bit of credit and know that you have struggled but have made it onto the right path."
