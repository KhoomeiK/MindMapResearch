PlayStationPlus,fqtwj6x,t1_fqtw6sb,1589647480.0,Yeah. I guess it harder to ban people on console too due to physical copies. That makes a pay wall a bit more attractive.

Example: I'm sure downloads server cost money. Ps store already takes a cut for every purchase have nothing to do with multiplayer

The multiplayer part tho that doesn't demand any significant server power at all. It would if playstation hosted all the game server but they don't. They are hosting the account management. And we'll account management doesn't take any significant server power att all. The data storage for that stuff is litterly hashes / text files (not text files but you get my point) it's in the kilobytes."

NetflixViaVPN,for1hnj,t3_g8uqa9,1588004549.0,It switches your netflix library location automatically. No need to change account
HomeNetworking,foo3aa7,t3_g8d3of,1587931657.0,If you use a managed switch you can configure them so the LAN data will be able to go straight to the destination instead of passing the router. So if you have a bad router managed switches can make the lan transfer speeds faster. But in your case having a pfsense as router it should be powerful enough anyway I can guess. So you won't see any other difference than your pfsense machine needing to work a bit.
