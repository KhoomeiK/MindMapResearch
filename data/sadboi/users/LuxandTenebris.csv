TheMonkeysPaw,evdlfjx,t3_cjb32h,1564441118.0,"Granted, just the biological parents can hear them crying.

Adoptive parents can’t so they can’t never turn around, leave the room or sleep without knowing if the baby is alright. 
So there must be always one person watching the child.

The causes two things: 

Every night one parent have to stay up to watch the baby. 
But because this is to exhausting a new job would be created all adoptive parents around the world would start to hiring somebody who’s watching their child (especially at night).
This creates a lot of new workplaces but poor parents can’t Pay for this so they still have to stay up all night. 

This causes a lack of sleep and the anxiety to fall asleep this causes paranoia and hallucinations and this causes that the parents aren’t able to care for the baby anymore and the baby gets to new adoptive parents.

For the baby’s: 

The baby’s realize that their adoptive parents can’t hear them.
Because their are little babies they have no other possibility to get attention from other peoples  so they getting anxious also they realize soon enough that their adoptive parents will lose their minds this creates more fear and anxiety until the have to change the adoptive family.
The will get new adoptive parents and all starts over again 
the babies will grow up in constant fear.

For the biological parents:

They hearing their babies cry every day and every night and this drives them insane and they have to be admitted to a hospital."

It all started when I was a child, I used to feel demons and because I grew up in a really religions surrounding they told me that they’re real and the demons want me and I have to protect myself.
Also I had the paranoid fear that people gonna kill me especially my parents.
(So I have to told you that I grow up in a abusive Familie and my parents where alcoholics, so I think this was a trigger)
Then I started doing Alkohol and drugs in my teens and my paranoia grow instantly also my privat situation stressed me really hard and I thought that all the people can hear my thoughts and they’re watching me and that they installed cameras and Mikrofons everywhere I go , that people poisoned my water and food etc,  also I started to see the demons fully and things I call creatures. 

I think this is some typical development.
there was no clear trigger it was a process over years to a full Psychose, caused by genetics (my grandfather had schizophrenia), shitty childhood the abuse of drugs. 
But I think that the main reason is stress. 
So try to avoid stress if you can"
