State authorities faced criticism for classifying as COVID-19 death a man with astronomical .55 blood-alcohol content.


Colorado health officials this week implemented a more precise coronavirus data metric to measure deaths from the virus in that state, one that sent confirmed COVID-19 fatalities tumbling by a full 25%. 
Public health officials in the state elected to start distinguishing between individuals who died directly from the disease and those who simply died with the virus in their systems. Authorities in that state had faced criticism this week for classifying as a COVID-19 death a man whose blood-alcohol content registered an astronomical .55. 
With the new system in place, confirmed coronavirus deaths in Colorado plummeted from 1150 to 878, a drop of almost 25%.

Coronavirus could “burn out naturally”, claims a former director of the World Health Organisation.
His comments come as the UK Government announces a £90 million campaign to produce a vaccine.
Professor Karol Sikora, an oncologist and chief medical officer at Rutherford Health, said the public probably has more immunity to Covid-19 than realised.
He thought the virus could end up “petering out by itself”.
Writing on social media he explained:
“There is a real chance that the virus will burn out naturally before any vaccine is developed.
“We are seeing a roughly similar pattern everywhere – I suspect we have more immunity than estimated.
“We need to keep slowing the virus, but it could be petering out by itself.”

DENVER (KDVR) — Nearly 300 fewer people have died directly from COVID-19 in Colorado than originally reported, after the Colorado Department of Health and Environment changed the death statistics Friday.
CDPHE now reports that as of May 9, 878 people had died “due to” COVID-19 and 1,150 people have died “among” COVID-19 cases.
“We have been reporting at the state, deaths among people who had COVID-19 at the time of death and the cause of that death may or may not have been COVID-19,” Dr. Eric France, CDPHE’s chief medical officer said Friday.
One of those stories came from Montezuma County this week. The county coroner said a man who had COVID -19 died from “ethanol toxicity” – basically, alcohol poisoning. The coroner said the state, however, classified the death as coronavirus-related.

France also said the death discrepancy was in part because of how the state reports statistics to the federal National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System.
“Having these two systems in place has potentially created some confusion and we apologize for that,” said Dr. Rachel Herlihy, state epidemiologist.

A team of virologists from Frankfurt University took the job of studying and understanding SARS-CoV-2 in their hands. They administered the growth and behavior of SARS-CoV-2 in controlled human cell culture, using the mePROD method.

 Their findings were later published in the paper, “Proteomics of SARS-CoV-2-infected host cells reveals therapy targets”, on ThursdayIt is known that viruses usually grow and replicate themselves by taking over the protein production of their host cell.

 However, SARS-CoV-2 behaves in a slightly different manner, and instead of using the existing protein production of the host, it mutates the host cell to produce more protein than it usually does, and then the virus feed over that surplus protein to replicate itself

.Hence, the scientists now have the idea that if they can inhibit the protein production inside the host cell that the virus is residing in, they can reduce the spread of COVID-19. The good news is that they have already pinpointed a few drugs that did the trick for them such as, WP1122 and 2-DG.

Friday, May 15, 2020

The research is a collaboration between Alessandro Sette and Shane Crotty, both professors at the Center for Infectious Disease and Vaccine Research at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology. Their findings offer the first detailed look at the immune response of patients who contracted and recovered from SARS-CoV-2, which is causing the coronavirus pandemic.
""It seems likely to us that immunity is developed. At least some reasonable amount of immunity is present and is developed by most people,"" Crotty said. ""We would consider that good news and largely fits with the expectations we would have for an antiviral immune response.""
The study looked at the immune response in 20 patients treated at UC San Diego who had recovered from COVID-19. Because the participants were local to San Diego, the researchers will be able to study how their immune response to the disease is maintained over time.
The researchers were surprised to find some patients who had never been expoised to COVID-19 also showed an immune response to SARS-CoV-2. As part of a control group, Sette's lab tested blood samples taken from people between 2015 and 2018, before the virus was circulating, and found about half of those had immune memory that could recognize the COVID-19 virus.
""This was really, really striking. It was actually unexpected,"" Sette said. ""The most reasonable explanation for that is that there is some immune reactivity originating from being exposed to the common-cold coronavirus. There's a number of more benign human coronaviruses that cause just human colds.""

5/14/2020
Abie Rohrig had just turned 18 when he told his mom he would be donating a kidney to save a stranger's life. Her answer: No you're not. He did it anyway -- the organ went to a man about his age -- and his mom was so inspired she went and donated a kidney herself.

So Rohrig expected her to understand when he told her that, for the benefit of humanity, he may volunteer to become infected with Covid-19.

Rohrig is one of more than 16,000 people -- most of them young adults -- who have signaled their support for a controversial method of speeding up the development of a vaccine by intentionally infecting dozens of volunteers. The signees of the online registry -- a new website called 1 Day Sooner -- have all checked a box next to the statement: ""I am interested in being exposed to the coronavirus to speed up vaccine development.""

The practice is called a human-challenge study -- or controlled human infection study -- and it can truncate a conventional vaccine study by several months. The reason: Rather than waiting for months to assess what percentage thousands of vaccine-trial volunteers get infected with the disease in question while leading their day-to-day lives, a challenge trial is much simpler, in that it exposes about 100 volunteers directly to the pathogen -- via syringe, cocktail, mosquito bite or nasal spray after an experimental vaccine or placebo is administered. (If the Covid-19 study comes to fruition, experts say it would likely be administered by nose drop.)

Conventional vaccine trials typically consist of three phases -- the first, in which fewer than 100 participants are dosed to determine the safety; the second, in which the number of participants ramps up into the hundreds; and the third, in which the study is broadened to include thousands of people.

Typically, in that third phase, the participants return to their daily lives, and researchers -- over a period of months -- compare rates of infection between the placebo and test groups.

A human-challenge trial can replace a third phase, the Journal article says, short-circuiting the timeline by several months because researchers don't have to wait for participants to get infected the organic way -- by interacting with people at work, at school, in houses of worship or in homes. Instead, they expose the volunteers to the pathogen right then and there, in the lab.

ASU scientific team finds new, unique mutation in coronavirus study

SARS-CoV-2 mutation mirrors one found during 2003 SARS outbreak
ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY
As the coronavirus pandemic has swept across the U.S., in addition to tracking the number of COVID daily cases, there is a worldwide scientific community engaged in tracking the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself.

Efrem Lim leads a team at ASU that looks at how the virus may be spreading, mutating and adapting over time.
Now, using a pool of 382 nasal swab samples obtained from possible COVID-19 cases in Arizona, Lim's team has identified a SARS-CoV-2 mutation that had never been found before----where 81 of the letters have vanished, permanently deleted from the genome.


The study was published in the online version of the Journal of Virology.
One of the reasons why this mutation is of interest is because it mirrors a large deletion that arose in the 2003 SARS outbreak,"" said Lim, an assistant professor at ASU's Biodesign Institute. During the middle and late phases of the SARS epidemic, SARS-CoV accumulated mutations that attenuated the virus. Scientists believe that a weakened virus that causes less severe disease may have a selective advantage if it is able to spread efficiently through populations by people who are infected unknowingly.

5/12/2020
Mortality in Sweden continues to fall after the peak in mid-April, according to Statistics Sweden's preliminary weekly statistics. But the differences around the country continue to be large.

The preliminary statistics are now updated until 8 May. The top level at national level is still week 15, which has now been adjusted to 2,554 deaths. It is the highest number of deaths in a week reported throughout the 21st century.

Statistics Sweden compares the preliminary statistics on deaths with an average for the corresponding periods 2015–2019. The levels that are higher than the average are what is described here as excess mortality.

Since the peak of week 15, national mortality counts per week have fallen.

""It was like my wedding day all over again, just to see my wife, my life partner, my companion be in the state she was in. I was truly amazed.""

It was late March when they both got sick from the coronavirus. Charlunda has underlying conditions so she was immediately admitted to Beaumont Dearborn and was soon on a ventilator. But it eventually all led to their reunion on May 6. 

Even though they're considered recovered they still a long way to go from living the life they once did, but they are even more determined to get there and make it better.

FOX NEWS - A 99-year-old Marine veteran earned a new medal this week -- to go along with the two Purple Hearts he was given for his actions during World War II -- after winning a long and tough battle against the coronavirus.
Max DeWeese, of Kansas City, wound up in the hospital and then a rehab facility after getting sick with COVID-19. He was discharged Thursday from Ignite Medical Resorts in Kansas City.
I’ve gone through hell more than once and this came almost as close,” DeWeese said, according to WSLS-TV.
DeWeese enlisted in the Marines after Pearl Harbor and served as a flamethrower in the South Pacific, including at the Battle of Guadalcanal.

Some treatments will be deployed immediately in hospitals, like remdesivir and blood thinners. Others will take more time, like the vaccine candidates that are in clinical trials. But there’s another form of COVID-19 therapy that’s starting to emerge and it looks like it’s already showing promising results. At least two separate teams claim they have identified antibodies that can kill the coronavirus, and the good news is these chemical compounds can be built into drugs that could be available to patients very soon.

U.S. regulators have approved a new type of coronavirus test that administration officials have promoted as a key to opening up the country.
The Food and Drug Administration on Saturday announced emergency authorization for antigen tests developed by Quidel Corp. of San Diego. The test can rapidly detect fragments of virus proteins in samples collected from swabs swiped inside the nasal cavity, the FDA said in a statement.
The antigen test is the third type of test to be authorized by the FDA.

Or maybe not, say Greek officials.

The Mediterranean nation appears to be a rare coronavirus success story.

By enforcing a strict and early lockdown, the country has managed to keep deaths incredibly low -- just around 150 so far.

This week, some businesses like hairdressers and bookstores were allowed to re-open for the first time.

And the country's pragmatic prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, thinks it may, ever so cautiously, be a model for welcoming back some travelers this summer.

Sorrento Therapeutics and Mount Sinai Health System in New York City have joined forces to develop an antibody cocktail they hope will shield against Covid-19 infection for up to two months. The treatment, called COVI-SHIELD, is designed to be administered as often as necessary, with each dose expected to provide antiviral protection for health care and other essential workers.
If approved by the FDA, it is anticipated that COVI-SHIELD will be offered as a prophylactic for those returning to work and as a therapeutic to those who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), the virus that causes Covid-19. It can also be used for the population at large as a treatment for those who may have been exposed to the disease.
