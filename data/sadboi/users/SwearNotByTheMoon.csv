I‚Äôm working my way through the first season on Hulu, and I‚Äôve had quite a few belly laughs while watching. The main cast is what really makes the show for me. Tony Oliver (Lupin), Richard Epcar (Jigen), Michelle Ruff (Fujiko), and Lex Lang (Goemon) are all clearly having a ball voicing their classic characters in this show, and it shows through every episode. I wish I knew the voice actor‚Äôs name for Zenigata, because he too is just having a blast. The supporting characters, while sometimes their performances aren‚Äôt as strong, are just as fun to watch. If you need a good laugh, have a look at **Lupin the 3rd Part II**."
