depression,f2z6b26,t1_f2xswik,1570507875.0,"I feel like this response misses the point. Everyone thinks you have to ""be tough"" and ""work through it"". To a certain extent, yes. But that piece of criticism needs to come after listening and supporting someone, not before it. And I mean active listening, not inputting your two cents because you know better. 

We need to learn to break the circle of ""if I did it so can they"" and start treating people how we wish we were."
