depression,fa9vghe,t1_fa91wxt,1575893546.0,"Honestly, I’ve wanted to go forever. I had a random moment of motivation to actually go yesterday and now I’m going again today. Anytime you get that random burst of energy, just ride it right to the gym. It feels so rewarding I promise"
depression,fa9vdi9,t1_fa7hxtn,1575893450.0,My alarm  went off to go again this morning about 15 minutes ago and my first thought was ah fuck I don’t wanna move but nope I’m up and I’m dressed and drinking a meal replacement shake. My bed does sound like heaven but I’m just gonna think of it as a reward when I get done
depression,fa9v924,t1_fa6snvw,1575893303.0,"Aw omg to be honest when I got in my car after I cried too. I’ve been so depressed and unmotivated for so long and this was a really big step for me. Not only the gym, I’ve been applying to better jobs because I didn’t feel like I could handle more than my shitty little part time job, and I did pretty good in my first semester back to college. Don’t be ashamed, happy crying is good :) thank you"

depression,fa99bpa,t1_fa531ow,1575865925.0,I’m actually going tomorrow morning! I just went and bought myself some meal replacement shakes to help curb some hunger in the morning and give me some energy
depression,fa999m3,t1_fa65viy,1575865877.0,"Honestly, I’m more motivated by actually seeing results and then I’m going to try sticking to a diet and really commit. Right now I just want to get into a routine because I don’t 100% feel like I can do it. Thank you for the advice!!"
depression,f0e6zhj,t1_f0dadkf,1568564022.0,"1) hes a piece of shit, girl. You dont need him
2) you can do it!!!! Its so hard dude trust me I know, but you can do it!! Find that little burst of energy and just go, trust me it helps so much from just small accomplishments of doing homework or going to class."
depression,exfubo2,t1_exfpkdm,1566248540.0,"Well honestly, I'm on a new antidepressant, Zoloft. Its helping a little but I realized I was never going to feel better about myself unless I went back and feel like I'm actually working towards something instead of getting more and more depressed because I'm working a minimum wage job forever. Other than that, I get random bursts of energy sometimes where I want to fix my life and feel like I can do anything so I usually wait for that to get stuff done lol"
depression,ex13yue,t1_ex0v7l1,1565929924.0,"Medication and the epiphany that I will be working menial minimum wage jobs for the rest of my life if I dont get off my butt and do something about it. Give your sister time, ask her if shes considered therapy, if you really really want to help, find her therapy, I dont want to say force her but part of depression is wanting to change but having no motivation to do so. If you set everything up for her, she may feel like she can actually do it. Good luck, message me if you want to talk."
depression,ex0a7pp,t1_ex09mg3,1565908184.0,I'm sorry no one has ever showed you support. I wish I could change that. I hope things get better for you.
depression,ex08x86,t1_ex07vul,1565907348.0,"I'm so sorry you're so sad that you cannot be happy for others, I sincerely hope you get better. My struggle is not yours, please don't assume you know what I've been through or how I feel."
depression,ex04cvj,t1_ewz9q7o,1565904860.0,"Oh wow ok this is actually a really hard question for me. I honestly dont know, I'm not cured, not even close. I mean even today, I'm getting alot of anxiety about going back. 

I have a few things that have helped. I've completely stopped drinking coffee, I've been drinking it since 14 and that's around the time I started having panic attacks. So barely any caffeine now. I watch alot of TV, tv is a huge stress reliever for me, if theres something stressing me out, I watch tv to distract myself. If you do this just be wary it can be detrimental if you start procrastinating too much, it can very easily turn into a cycle.

My biggest thing is meds. My doctor put me on zoloft. I have some side effects but nothing too extreme, for the most part it's working really well. If you are struggling with anxiety, I swear to you, meds help. You can get them from your GP or your gyno if you're a girl, you dont need an expensive psychiatrist to give you meds."

depression,ewzyi8u,t1_ewzjp7i,1565902473.0,"I appealed once the semester before I dropped out, but depression got the best of me and I was put on academic suspension which meant I need a 2.5 GPA to get my financial aid back. My last semester I tried my hardest and only took 2 classes just to get my gpa up and i got a 2.23. Literally .3 away from getting it back. That's when I gave up and dropped out."

depression,ewyjzum,t1_ewyjbl1,1565882378.0,"Tell that to my student loan company lol part of the reason I'm going back is to keep the debt away until I can get a job that pays more than 12 an hour.

(Hes joking about beating my ass but he'll definitely call me out on skipping.)"
depression,ewyilqd,t1_ewygexo,1565881706.0,"Just keep your head up, do what you need to make your mental health better whether it be meds or therapy, and once you feel you're in a better place, see what you can do to go back, ease yourself into it. Give yourself one goal a day, I started doing that last week and I already feel a million times better."

depression,ewydib4,t1_ewyczof,1565879196.0,"Yeah I overwhelmed myself in my last 2 semesters, I was taking 17 credits (6 classes) both semesters. I failed a few of the classes because i couldn't keep up on top of working as well to pay for gas and partially tuition. It made my anxiety and depression skyrocket and the stress of it made my meds stop working. I'm going to take it slow this time. I'm sick of feeling like I ruined my life and I'm finally doing something about it :)"
