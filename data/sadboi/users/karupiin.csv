It didn’t give me immediate results but keeping up with it paid off. I also find that being productive, especially in the moments I have to force myself, helps. Staring at a wall for hours lost in my head was not exactly helping lol. So I guess identifying the bad habits contributing to my dissociation and trying to stop myself from doing them helped, too. It was a lot of work, I was so dysfunctional that I just couldn’t take it anymore and started studying a lot. I realized I had more ambition than I thought and had the potential to achieve something as long as I could get through this. I studied anything that seemed liked it could help. Studying self help and psychology helped with the mental stuff, and studying philosophy and cognitive functions helped with my lack of identity.

And I already knew I had dissociative amnesia, I was in an abusive situation for 8 years and can’t remember the majority of those 8 years, and basically nothing about the abuse itself.

antinatalism,fq175k2,t3_gfnt3b,1589042697.0,"In my experience, self help was much more effective. I’ve been forcefully committed to hospitals, given dangerous cocktails of medications for mental illnesses I don’t even have, forced to sleep in a padded room with cameras just because I have insomnia, had to be watched constantly (even in the shower), and no one working at any of these places would listen to me. They give you a worksheet to do and then prescribe you some bullshit medications. You know what happened when I told them the medication wasn’t helping and I was getting side effects? They upped the dosages. Do you know what happened when I was misdiagnosed and told the psychiatrist that diagnosis didn’t match a single thing I was going through? He refuted it and couldn’t even explain why he gave me (and nearly everyone else on the unit) that diagnosis. He tried to convince me to go on disability even though I am fully capable of working and actually quite enjoy it (depending on the job) because it gives me the structure and productivity I need. There’s nothing “professional” about professional help. Yes, I did need help for some certain issues, but they were not there to help me. They just drug you up for a profit. They see everyone who goes in there as a dishonest insane person, even if you’re just depressed or have anxiety. 

I never needed cocktails of medications, I never needed to do any stupid worksheets, I didn’t need to be diagnosed with 7 mental illnesses when I do not even have 7 mental illnesses, I didn’t need to be coddled, and I certainly didn’t need to be treated like I was crazy. I’m a little crazier in the hospital, but they lock you up and take all the structure from your life. They tell you you’re crazy and they drug you up. I’m a human being capable of rational thought, but they will try to convince you otherwise. For a long time I didn’t even realize self help was an option. How could I, unlicensed with no professional background, help myself? For starters, I actually care about my issues. I actually know what’s going on in my head. I’m smart enough to tell when something is helping or not helping me. From there, it’s just research and trial and error. And completely free. 

TLDR: “professional” help is a scam that profits off people’s suffering. They don’t actually care what you’re going through."

I didn’t know if I could ever be happy, but how the hell would I know if I didn’t even try? Probably don’t say this to him, but I really was pathetic when I was letting myself wallow in despair. 

I think the best route to take is to rationalize with him and help him process it, and (gently) push him to come up with some future plans, or remind him of existing future plans if he has any. These plans should involve no one but himself. INTJs are typically individualistic people, so hopefully he ultimately realizes he doesn’t need a girl to be his reason for living. 

And I don’t know exactly how depressed he is right now (probably very depressed if he’s contemplating suicide) but one thing that helps me when I’m severely depressed is making a list of productive/fun things I want to do, and then doing them. Even when all I want to do is lay in bed (or die lol). It’s really the only way to pull myself out of lethargy.

I have ambitions, and they’re really the only important thing to me. While the end goals are not related to other people, I can’t get there without talking to anyone. The more you isolate, the worse your social skills become. I would know, mine are at ZERO right now.  Quarantine + not having friends in the first place will do that. The more exposure you have to social situations, the better your social skills become. I haven’t actually made too much progress with this yet but I have in the past. It’s easy to regress back to where you were once you start isolating again. 

Additionally, did you know that certain types of people will actually talk FOR YOU like some sort of interpreter? I have a sibling and a friend that do this for me and I never had to ask either of them to do this. Any time we’re out I can be completely silent and they will do all of the talking.

I’ve always thought I was just a boring nerd, to be honest. The most common criticism I’ve gotten throughout my life is that I’m so serious and quiet it’s scary. But I’m not really like that at all. 

I have, however, been starting to improve this problem lately. You don’t start to improve by just throwing yourself out there, you’re not going to have any idea what to do. What I did first was study. I gathered resources on how to improve my speaking skills, studied how “normal” people socialize, and I learned about myself too. Learning about myself was so important because I honestly had no idea who I was. People told me to “just be myself” but I had no idea how to, or what they even meant by that. After a while, I started to get a sense of how to properly socialize. And you DO have to be yourself to do it properly. 

The first time I tried to go out and talk and be myself, I thought I did horrible. For days I ruminated on it, I felt horrible and wanted to give up. But then I heard that everyone thought I was cool! I was shocked. People really are more worried about how they come off than they are about how you come off.

Networking is so far from schmoozing for nepotism points (although there are plenty who do this, but that’s what I call being an ass kisser not a networker), you can have a beneficial professional relationship while being your authentic self and maintaining your independent ideas. You just need to prove that your ideas are worth listening to. All you need to gain merit is respect, not friends.

Accept what you cannot change, and be better."

intj,fpekz7h,t1_fpehd2s,1588549569.0,"Sounds like you need to find some good likeminded  people, they’re out there I promise. Many of the INTJs I’ve seen on here get roped into social isolation and misanthropy, I’ve been there myself and it’s hard not to fall back on those views at times. It’s black and white thinking and you’re only ostracizing yourself. A common trope I see thrown around is that INTJs are quick to drop people if they see a valid reason for doing so. Losing faith in society as a whole can easily make us isolate from everyone, family included. What made me realize I needed to change my mindset was the fact that my isolation was causing a lot of damage in my life and it was negatively impacting my job and getting in the way of every goal I had set for myself. My social skills had deteriorated to 0 and I started getting suspicious of others and paranoid. Even though I had no desire to talk to others and dreaded every second I had to be outside of my house, I knew I wasn’t headed in a good direction and I was never going to amount to anything or be happy if I kept it up. I didn’t start by immediately throwing myself into social situations, I studied instead. Philosophy was especially helpful, as well as learning networking skills. In the end I’m still an introvert that doesn’t like a lot of people, but I have a lot more control over my life, I can deal with annoying coworkers, and there are people I make time for. I don’t know if my words will resonate with you but you should give it a shot."

I never want to make her feel like she’s exaggerating or like I am trying to control her life, but I’ve been enabling her to stay trapped in that mindset in many ways. It hurts to see her stuck like this and I can see she needs a positive change. I’ll do my best to help her find herself and help her change the negative view she has of herself. I’m not really sure if I will go about it in the right way, and I know I’ll be nothing more than a guide as change comes from within, but it can’t hurt to try. I can just try something else if it doesn’t work out rather than getting frustrated with her. 

I do understand where these thoughts about herself came from, on top of her hospitalizations ruining her academic career we did not have a good home life growing up. We have a nice home life now, but the wounds of the past run deep. She’s having a lot of trouble moving on from it, but there are resources that have helped me a lot and I want to try sharing them with her."

I can appreciate these accomplishments without agreeing with what he’s been spewing on Twitter. 

He truly is a disillusioned skeptic, probably going crazy from quarantine, and I know this because of the fact that for the past few months he has been linking articles to bogus “research” that undermines the severity of the pandemic, and links claiming that US officials are exaggerating the numbers for their own political gain. He really believes it but he is wrong. I am an essential worker living in the most infected area in the world and I have seen what the reality is. But he has not seen what I have seen.

They initially matched on a dating site, they messaged each other a little bit but never hit it off or tried meeting up. But then they participated in the same race together. They recognized each other from the dating site, ended up chatting, and realized they had a ton of common interests and enjoyed their banter with one another. They started going on runs together, then they started training for races together. Before they knew it, they had fallen in love. They did take things slowly at first, as both of them had come from an unhealthy marriage and both of them had children, but they knew deep down it was meant to be.

Twins,fpdquey,t3_gcuwdw,1588532386.0,"In my family we have two sets of twins and I have a little brother and sister that aren’t twins. My twin and I are the oldest (identical females), and the rest are much younger than us. (Oldest is 10 years younger and the other set of twins, fraternal male and female, are 14 years younger). My twin and I love playing with the younger kids, when they were little we would invent crazy games for them(demon sacrifice game was fan favorite but it was hard to explain to our mother why the children were running around chanting “sacrifice”). 

Because we are much older than our younger siblings, exclusion was never an issue with us and we always wanted to play with them. But it’s not an issue for the little twins either, all four of my little siblings get along together. With them, the more the merrier. If exclusion seems to be an issue, maybe try suggesting activities where they will all need to interact with one another. I’m sure there are plenty of things your kids would all enjoy! No team games, though. There’s only three and you never want a set of twins to gang up on you.

My sister and I do have a special bond that’s different than my bond with my other siblings, but I would never want to exclude them and I care about them a lot. Just because my younger siblings aren’t my twin(in fact we’re only half siblings), doesn’t mean I don’t love them as full siblings."

My good friend is INFP and he struggles with self worth too. Hell, even I have struggled with self worth my entire life. I guess it’s less of an MBTI thing, but I believe that the ways you can work on yourself and improve your confidence does depend somewhat on your MBTI. Because learning about yourself (although we never truly stop learning) and accepting yourself as you are is the best start to improving your self worth."

AvPD,fpdgaz6,t3_gco74z,1588526422.0,"It’s true, people are more worried about how you are perceiving them than they are about how awkward you are. Humans are motivated by their own vanity and pride. Of course knowing this doesn’t get rid of the horrible thought process I’ve trapped myself in, but it’s a start. Acknowledging this has helped me in social situations, but it’s only a tool for identifying the unhealthy thoughts and does nothing to get rid of them. 

A good trick when you start to feel yourself getting overly awkward and self conscious is to start asking the other person questions about themself. Make them focus inward rather than outward, and they will probably start to like you more because they will perceive it as you showing interest in them. You might even make a genuine friend like that!

And I wouldn’t say I ever really appeared to be awkward (although I felt that way), I usually just appear much more serious and rigid than I truly am. Cold, even. So I do have to go out of my way to act like I’m nice and empathetic, but I’m simply just trying to express myself better because I’m not cold or rigid deep down."
ENFP,fpdexgr,t1_fpcixm5,1588525654.0,"INTJ here, I agree 100%. ENFPs are some of the best people out there to have an in depth discussion with. They can think abstractly, read between the lines, actually show genuine interest when I’m rambling about things that bore most people (I really appreciate that one), and they ask questions that challenge the way I think. Just because you’re Fe dominant doesn’t mean you can’t think logically, that’s far from the truth. In my experience (being twins with one and good friends with others), ENFPs have a very complex worldview and think deeply and originally. They’re definitely not all sunshine and rainbows but they prefer positivity and harmony with others when they can. They’re nonjudgmental and like to see things from every perspective. I could go on, but just know that ENFP is my favorite type!"

His tweets are irresponsible, misinformed, and he should probably stop posting but this doesn’t change the fact that he’s done a lot of good for the world. I’m not going to buy into ‘cancel culture’ and erase his good deeds just because he doesn’t seem to see the same pandemic I see.

Isn’t it kind of cool that we get to be alive through some freak chance and have a brain to learn about the universe with? You don’t have to think humans are special to be happy. Life is meaningless and we aren’t significant in the grand scheme of things but we can still learn a lot and find little things that make us happy. Why does the world have to have a meaning? You need to decide what your meaning is for yourself. 

I have my own nihilistic and misanthropic views, and I’ve been very depressed and suicidal for a huge portion of my life. The last time I attempted I didn’t even know why I did it. Just a crushing emptiness, I felt nothing when I attempted. I didn’t even feel real anymore. It was such a bad attempt that I didn’t remember the next 3 weeks and had to relearn how to walk. No one in my life saw it coming even though I’d been planning it for a while, and I got dumped because they realized I wasn’t being honest about my feelings (not that I ever knew how I was feeling) and they really didn’t know anything about me. But I decided I would never turn to that again, I want to see what I can do here on this planet. Instead of looking at life as something meaningless, I started to see it as a challenge to overcome. I didn’t know if I would ever be content, but how could I know without trying? Sure, life is literally meaningless, but you can change your interpretation. Life is meaningless so you get to be the one that determines your purpose."

I highly doubt an INTJ man with ambitions is trying to be manly, he literally just wants to accomplish things on his own accord regardless of what others say or how they view him."

Most insomniacs aren’t going to get immediate results from those, but sticking to it will improve things over time. 

As tempting as it is to stay up all night coding or watching documentaries because you can’t sleep, you may be overstimulating your brain.
