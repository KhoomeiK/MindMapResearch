He's been one of my fave sci-fi authors growing up as a teenager. Most of his books were made to big budget movies, most notably jurassic park, but his novels are way, way more absorbing and way more tense. His books kind of steered me to work in the medical field. I've always loved the andromeda strain, and his earlier book 5 patients. You can see throughout his career how he develops his technique of blending incredibly done research and explanation of facts without the whole thing feeling like a school textbook. It is absolutely amazing and engrossing. He eventually covers different fields, starting from science and medicine (as he used to be a doctor), economics, planes, medieval stuff, and even pirates. 
I wish I could feel the same excitement I felt when I first read his books. Too bad we lost him too soon."
