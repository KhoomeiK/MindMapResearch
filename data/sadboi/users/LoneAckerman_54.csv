depression,fdugj8o,t3_emx959,1578732617.0,"You're not alone. I'm tired of it too. I came out in 8th grade and it was good at the time but i wish i wasn't like this honestly. For me it makes a wall between me and the people around me. I told a friend, not out of trust, but because i told myself i wouldn't lie to myself. He seemed accepting but then his parent found out and things changed. We couldn't play games in his room, we had to be in the living room. That bothered me a bit because before she found out it didn't seem to be a problem, now it's like whenever i go over there i feel like I'm not wanted and it's very uncomfortable. Of course he's not completely aware of this because I only told bits and pieces."
