Now, it’s more alone the lines of me deleting texts before they’re sent when I’m going through it. That’s much more destructive in my life; I gotta stop messaging people so much."

Depression is _stupid_ impossible to work around sometimes; don’t think for one minute that you’re bad at any of this just because depression got in the way. Just keep trying. Even if you fall off the bandwagon five more times, try again. :) So long as you don’t rule it out as a goal and possibility, you’ll find a way to make it hold in the future."
