Mine is almost the opposite of /u/Rengar_Is_Good_kitty i would get nauseated with my meds so I took them at night. I switched to days because that was easier for me after a couple years and noticed I was sleeping through the night. So I just got some Ondansetron and it has worked for me thus far.

I take Zoloft and Lamictal and if I miss more than 2 doses I have some hardcore panic attacks. The last one I had from missing doses I thought I was legit dying because I had never had one so severe. I couldn’t feel my nose or hands. I tried to call my mom and could barely dial. It was bad but scared me straight. I haven’t missed more than 2 doses since. I get panic attacks and anxiety is SUPER high and I get emotional when I miss doses. I also get dizzy when I miss just 1 dose. That’s how I know if I forgot to take my meds or not.

I did make it home. Nonetheless, I was scared I was going to be stuck. While NZ is GORGEOUSSSSSS, I didn’t want to be stuck in an apartment away from family, friends, and even my job.

I work in veterinary medicine, I deal with euthanasia on the daily. We always recommend support during these times. Depending on your relationship with your pet, it may be harder than not. The clinic may have references for support groups if you need them. We vary for patients, but our clients are important too. 

I do not recommend for any sort of grieving process to push it away and not face it head on. It only makes it worse. I promise you it will get better, time heals all wounds.

I truly believe they’re always with you even after their gone. I had a dream with my dog where he came to say hi then I told him it was ok to go now. I’ll be fine. I sometimes wish I hadn’t because I haven’t seen him since and I miss him everyday!
