AskReddit,f9ip9y7,t1_f9hzd5c,1575342678.0,"I used to train people on bystander intervention/rape prevention, stuff like that...one time in this group of frat boys and athletes that had to attend my training on campus, a guy starting crying and admitted to raping a girl. He legitimately didn't realize that ""tricking"" a girl by getting her incapacitated was considered rape. A few other guys agreed with him and said they didn't realize that coercing without physical force could be rape. The first time I heard it I was appalled. Now I understand its a common misconception among some people (both genders). I kinda felt for the kid because he seemed very sincere, but I just couldn't comprehend his thought process."

Every therapist I've ever had has said that if I was helped at a younger age, my depression would be much more manageable now. Don't put it all on yourself. Get a trusted adult to figure out a good game plan for your sister. 

That's a lot on you, too. If you need someone to talk to about it, you should too. It's a lot to process. Hang in there, kiddo. ðŸ’œ"

SuicideWatch,ewfeovf,t1_ewfbpcw,1565359036.0,"First, I'm so sorry for your loss. As someone who had a very serious suicide attempt, even if you shared a bedroom with your kid brother, it's likely you could've still been caught off guard. Don't blame yourself. I know that's easier said than done, but when someone is so desperately wanting to leave, they're not going to show signs. I still regret having a nice afternoon/evening with my friends, knowing full well I was going to commit suicide when they left. I could've told them, I could've reached out...but in the end, I just didn't want to. I was beyond wanting anymore help. That was on me, not them.

I know that's not the most comforting way to word it, but I sincerely hope you are able to come to see this."

It mostly happens when I pause something, forget, run into kid's school or Starbucks and leave car running, and when back in the Bluetooth range it decides to unpause."
