AskReddit,fmws7m4,t1_fmwek03,1586452100.0,"Unfortunately it’s really hard as someone who’s experienced trauma to discern between those types of experiences because when you experience trauma, it’s hard to think about anything else in general, but it also minimizes memories of other difficult experiences. For example, I don’t remember anything related or similar to the examples you just gave but I do remember being sexually assaulted and experiencing domestic violence, in detail. I’m sure this is a really hard place for teachers to be bc you don’t always get to choose the prompts you give students, but at the same time, when the prompt is asking students to recall a difficult time in their lives, “difficult” is defined really differently by different students and you’re bound to hear some traumatic things."

This happens in the case of chronic illness and pain in women as well. Sexism prevented the ability for research to be conducted on women with disabilities because women were never thought to have disabilities unless it was seriously inhibiting either physically or mentally. Basically, the health of women has never been taken seriously and even now, in 2020, women’s health is often undermined by sexism and women are treated differently by medical professionals, even by female medical professionals."

relationship_advice,fm8zhpa,t3_fth6f9,1585858880.0,"Okay, so after reading these comments, it seems like they’re all from men. Here’s my perspective; my ex said this to me too and he was also an abuser. A major component of a relationship is trust. If he doesn’t trust you to be faithful, why would he have a child with you? It seems really paranoid and manipulative to me, especially if you’ve shown absolutely no signs that you would cheat, have never cheated in the past, have no reason to cheat, etc. This is something I would definitely have a serious conversation with him about, maybe even including a third party. This big of a lack of trust in you and your fidelity is only going to cause further issues in your relationship. Paternity tests can be great when a reasonable doubt in paternity occurs. But to force your child to undergo a paternity test as a newborn when there’s absolutely no reason to question paternity, thats paranoia and speaks to a serious lack of trust."

ptsd,flrt3rz,t3_fqd4pb,1585427284.0,"I know this can feel really devastating, however, like a majority of these comments are saying, you’d much rather have a therapist who specializes in the type of trauma you’ve experienced and can actually help you than someone who isn’t equipped to. Plus, if your therapist specializes in childhood trauma, it may have been out of her scope of practice to treat you. This is protecting both of you, you from receiving inadequate and ineffective treatment and her from issues of malpractice. I would suggest at least reaching out to the referral as it sounds like you’re still in need of therapy. Not all therapists are equipped to handle all areas of mental health and that’s just kind of... the way it is? She most likely referred you to someone who can actually help you, she’s just not equipped to.

Edit: In addition, she’s a person susceptible to trauma too and she has a right to deny treatment if she feels she may be harmed emotionally by treating you. It’s less of a judgement and more of a safeguard for her mental health."

I’m 21 (yeah, I know, big age gap) and dated various people throughout middle and high school, up into college. I’d say I had about 5 serious boyfriends during that time. In each relationship, I got more and more comfortable with communicating my needs and, in general, communicating more effectively and calmly. I also learned about the things I was absolutely not willing to accept in a relationship or partner, including abuse and manipulation. I’m a better partner for that experience and because my current partner is willing to work on things and learn and listen to me, we communicate effectively with each other and have little to no reason to argue.

If you cared to read into my second comment, you’d see that I correct myself adjust my argument. I understand everyone is different, but for the sake of this situation, this woman, the judge, told another woman that she was talking too much for her complaint to be taken seriously, which is something misogynists (who are usually men, but can definitely be women) usually say to women they consider “hysterical.” What I find really funny is that this whole post is about a man brutally killing his son. Do I resent violent men? Yes. Do I resent all men? No. But do I resent ALL people who hate women, especially those who prevent women from gaining custody of their children who later die a brutal, tragic death? Absolutely."

TrueCrime,fgtjjyd,t1_fgtir01,1581105292.0,"I was unaware but I do still feel that women in roles of power, such as law enforcement, often have an inflated sense of masculinity and can still treat women the same way men in similar roles treat women. I feel like because her husband, the murderer, was a cop and has previously filed a false complaint against her, the mother of the children, the judge might’ve been less patient. But the lack of empathy for this woman screams misogyny, even if it’s internalized."

serialkillers,fgtd85s,t3_f09yg0,1581102955.0,"I’ve watched the whole ‘Serial Killer’ series and every single one is bad. Piers doesn’t know how to interview people, especially people that have been incarcerated or charged with violent crimes. He doesn’t try to get any information from them lightly, he just wants to hear them say that they killed someone. I watched part of his other series ‘Killer Women’ after I finished the first series and the way he treats men and women is so starkly different. He still is horrible at interviewing them, but the women are more likely to admit to what they’ve done so it’s easier on him, in a way. But he treats even grown women as if they’re children and he treats the men in ‘Serial Killer’ as if they’re the most heinous criminals in existence. I always chuckled at how every episode started off with “this is one of the most infamous serial killers in America” and then it was some Joe Schmoe nobody’s ever heard of."
TrueCrime,fgtb8p5,t1_fgst622,1581102101.0,"Reading this, it seems the judge is definitely in part responsible and the whole “you’re talking too much” bit screams misogyny, in my opinion. I wonder how many other women he’s shut down for “talking too much.” He should be charged."
AskDocs,fgtatiw,t3_f0c625,1581101875.0,"I’m NAD but this interested me and from what I can gather by a little bit of research, it does seem that saline breast implants can grow mold, especially if they’re open filled. The degeneration over time may have allowed for mold growth. Whether or not there is mold, it seems like it’s a good idea to have them removed or replaced since they’re reaching their “expiration date” so to say."
