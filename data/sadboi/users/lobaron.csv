Think about the scale of that. We've been mining for millenia to some capacity. The project would go quicker as more drones and energy is added, but manual operation would take centuries. We definitely should start with another planet.

But in any case, this is a project that would likely cost trillions and trillions of dollars the way we currently do things. We haven't even gotten much of a major permanent presence in space yet. We should probably start with the tether, get a moon base set up for fueling and construction, then start looking towards major interplanetary projects. I don't think anything like this will happen in anyone living's lifetime.

If we get the tether, and get the moon base, I suspect that the project will become much more cheap. I couldn't give you a price point."
space,fqddlml,t1_fqcrscv,1589287251.0,"So, I am going to argue slightly against one thing earthfall10 said. This solar panels, due to the sheer number required to surround the Sun, need to be as simple as possible in order to not break all of the time and to limit waste. Due to this, they are essentially just a thin layer of reflective material in a frame. They reflect the sunlight to a centralized generator which will then beam the energy elsewhere.

While there are many reasons why we aren't doing this now, the main reasons I can think of are that we need a better way to get things into space, and we need better robotics for automated mining, refinishing, manufacturing, and launching of the panels.

That being said, the best method of getting anything into space right now is a Space tether. Essentially, it is a large object in orbit with a long tether on it. The ship is scooped by the tether and sent into orbit. It would rely on traffic coming and going to maintain it's momentum. We can also build this right now and it would revolutionize space travel and humanity's relationship with space."
space,fqdbznb,t1_fqcuqc9,1589286073.0,"Well, due to the sheer number of panels required for a Dyson Swarm, this is not ideal. Essentially, the more complex, the more likely it is to break, and with quadrillions of panels.... That'll happen a lot.

falloutlore,fqbazdz,t1_fqb8sm3,1589233694.0,"The problem here is that radiation is an energy released when specific elements start to break down. Because there is no guessing when a particular atom will degrade, radiation would continue to be released.

The reason why fallout (the event, not the game) is dangerous is because particles of this material can be absorbed through eating, drinking, or breathing, and are then incorporated into your body. It's the reason why iodine tablets are are taken to limit the damage from some radioactive materials. Essentially, the iodine takes up the same spots in your body that some other radioactive material would otherwise be absorbed into. So rather than having that material in your body for years, you pass it through your body.

By the same token, if I were to say... Put strontium in a patty of beef, it would continue to eek out radiation from beginning to end until it was totally exhausted. There are a lot of factors, and I've only described it to the best of my (layman) ability. This is why I don't think it's possible, but I am not a nuclear physicist, chemist, or the like... I'm just a guy that likes reading articles in my free time.

Edit: Technically, if you were to strip an atom of all of its electrons, it's half-life would conceivably be infinite. But the ability and cost to strip it of electrons and keep it from acquiring more might be a bit intensive for our fictional food manufacturer."

I'm not a fan of plant based diets. I'll continue to eat meat until cloned meat becomes a thing. The only reason I've considered switching is due to environmental reasons but changes should be systemic, because hoping everyone changes on their own is pointless. 

Empathy is not binary. You can have different levels of empathy. I have more empathy for sapient things than nonsapient. 

You aren't directly claiming they are the same, but there is a comparison there between the car accident analogy and livestock."

I have empathy for people, yes, but that is because they are sapient. I do have empathy for animals and wish them as little suffering/as much happiness as possible but I have no illusions that they are the same as people."

It's like if I hear about someone dying in a car accident, I will be less upset if it's someone I don't know, rather than if it is a friend or a family member of a friend. Hell, people are more likely to feel more if they hear something about the death of someone who is in a similar situation as them or a family member. By the same token, I get upset from hearing that someone eats dogs because I own a dog and it's part of the family. I have never owned nor been around a chicken or cow, so I don't feel as much about it. Humans are silly emotionally charged beings that can empathize with a pencil, and even be coerced into feeling sad at it's ""death"", given emotional context. Most people have the emotional context with cats and dogs that they don't with livestock."
