Austin,fhzwxq7,t1_fhzu1fc,1582015557.0,"I don’t consider NYC or Tokyo failures, just pointing out that density does not equal affordability. Especially when real estate there is a hot investment commodity. People travel for hours in both cities to get from affordable areas to city center areas.

We already have increased demand, displacing thousands  more currently in homes will just increase already high demand. Any new inventory will to the highest bidder, whether it’s the newly arrived rich, or investors. Not much left to trickle down to the masses.

Is there enough housing in NYC? It’s about 70,000 people per sq mile in Manhattan. Do all of them have affordable, fair housing? They do have an awful lot of super tall buildings. Even with NYC’s Affordable housing programs, and some rent control, there’s still not enough for everyone.

In order to build fair, accessible housing, you have to take the profit margin out of real estate. But with no rising rices, you have no upkeep, and you get slums.

Kicking homeowners out of their homes in this haphazard way, makes the rich developers richer, the street more congested, and the have - nots still having not. Did you see the thing on the news that broke down how little mega developers had to pay in lieu of building affordable units? Most of them coughed up the cash rather than made a few units affordable.  COA is sitting on a bunch of money and not much is being built with it.  Instead of chasing off home owners, why isnt COA converting city property into low income housing? What about strip malls? Barton Spring Mall,  all of that asphalt covered land just for temporary leaving cars. Let’s bulldoze stripmalls and use them for infill housing."
Austin,fhzqhy0,t3_f5mkbo,1582007648.0,"How affordable is NYC?  Demand in  desirable city core areas will always outstrip supply until that city becomes undesirable. NYC is a perfect example. In the 70’s and 80’s there was plenty of affordable housing, because nobody wanted to live there.

What do you propose to do with the “spoiled minority” of homeowners who are ruining your high-rise utopia? What about the renters who live in older homes who will be displaced? You’re adding pressure to the demand side of the equation.

How do you prevent investors, air bnb operators, wholesale flippers, people from out of state with cash from devouring the new inventory as soon as it hits the market?  You assume that there is a point that supply overtakes demand and that causes an excess in inventory, lowering prices. How do you propose doing that with housing?  Do you believe that government should ration all housing like the Soviet Union? They weren’t too successful (spoiler warning). 

And back to NYC, (and Vancouver, London, SF Bay, Amsterdam, Tokyo) .... since prices just keep climbing, do you have any Idea how many housing units are just purchased and left empty as an investment? How do you propose to stop that in Austin? I’ve heard a significant amount of downtown units are unoccupied or second homes. If housing was  just simple supply and demand, surely there would be an urbanist utopia we could look to that has solved the affordability crisis.  I can’t think of a current one. 

I really wish there were simple answers to affordability. Displacing tens of thousands of people with one major asset isn’t going to give us an urbanist dream.
