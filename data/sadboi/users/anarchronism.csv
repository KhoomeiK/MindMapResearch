My favourite thing I heard during the Olympics was that cops were 'giving' the homeless 'free' one way greyhound tickets to other provinces to get them out of the way of the cameras for the week. 

Imagine you were selected to go on TV, and you were so focused on making sure you were pretty and charming that you stop going to your dayjob and let your pets starve to death. That's pretty much the effect the Olympic games have on every city marked with the dubious honor of host."

OneyPlays,ffpt3jn,t3_etuqck,1580104702.0,"Well you see- in this world you can spend XP on being funny OR being cool. It's something I think about often when trying to discern why I like or dislike any particular entertainer.

You can be so funny that it makes you cool (becoming successful as a stand-up comedian), but I've never seen anyone so cool that it makes them funny (but if you're cool enough people will laugh at your jokes anyway.) This is complicated further when you realize that funny and cool are both subjective, so the best any individual will be able to do is aim for what THEY FIND to be cool or funny.

 Even Andrew Dice Clay's ""cool"" leather jacket greaser persona is essentially taking the piss out of that kind of ""cool guy"". The irony being that the satire flew over his audience's heads and their willingness to accept that that act was legitimately cool, and the huge success he had with it, went straight to Dice's head, making him believe in his own bullshit, and now half the thing that's funny about him is he thinks he's actually cool. 

Anyway, Lyle has spent more XP on cool than funny.  

So with that we get a tribal tattoo and some pretty standard 2002-edgebro chuckles.

The reason Zach is the undisputed king is that he has clearly not wasted one point of XP on being cool.  (which some might even consider coolest of all, not caring about being cool)"
