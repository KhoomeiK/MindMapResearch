BPD,fo843bg,t3_g68t0s,1587589545.0,"Yes I have, 5 days in June, 4 days in August 2017. First time, I had been so manic/anxious that I hadn‚Äôt kept food down in a week or two, the 3 days prior I was vomiting water and bile. Couldn‚Äôt get out of bed, I was too weak to do anything other than dissociate, cry, wish I was dead, etc. Demanded my parents take me to the hospital (against their wishes). Second time, went in a family trip to drop my younger sis off at college, got triggered by my pedo narc father, the vomiting resumed. Checked myself in when I got home. 

The experiences were extremely helpful; first visit I was medicated with Ativan the first 3 days, and put on gabapentin (mood stabilizer) and metropolol (physical anxiety). Second visit, only a day and a half of Ativan, same meds, journaled my heart out, discussed my problems with some profoundly empathetic nurses - with their encouragement, I decided to remove my father from my life. Best decision I‚Äôve ever made. 

When to know? Well that certainly varies for everyone. For me though, aside from the physical symptoms (which were truly atrocious), it was like a switch flipped in my mind that I couldn‚Äôt turn off. (Makes more sense now, at the time I had been diagnosed w bipolar for 10+ years, and back then, the doctors I spoke with disagreed with my BPD self diagnosis). It was a classic shame spiral, yes, except there was literally nothing I could do to snap out of it. I thought of ways to kill myself, how badly I wanted to not exist, and if I did go on living I wanted to be in a coma with a feeding tube. Pretty dark shit.

So I suppose, when to know is really up to you. I think we all know deep down when we can and cannot handle something with our usual resources. Pm if you want to chat"

depression,eytx95i,t3_cyhuvf,1567447768.0,"Hi there. My best advice to you, unfortunately, will agree with those people from the hotline. Therapy can and will help you (although it may take time to find the right one). Not all of us are blessed with a pristine support system made up of family, friends, coworkers, classmates, etc. A lot of us are left to deal with our lives by ourselves, and that shit can be way way WAY too much, even without mental health issues. 

I was engaged at 20 (stupid, I know), in a relationship for 2 years, discussing kids and a future together.... but then he started messaging lots of girls he claimed were ‚Äúfriends,‚Äù but they would only come over when I was at school or work. Eventually, he would insult me and accuse me of cheating daily (ironically enough), so I left, been cheated on twice since. 

You never know what this bitch of a life will throw at you my friend, so I highly suggest finding a therapist. You are not alone in needing support. Take it from a gal who has experienced a traumatic event at least every 6 months, since the beginning of time. 

Lastly, I wanted to say that you can find someone who will support you and love you unconditionally. I am so truly sorry for what you‚Äôve dealt with. You will be so much stronger for it, though. I believe in you, Internet friend."
bipolar,eytvyfj,t3_cyrg61,1567446925.0,"
Ultimately, if you offer your partner support and space when needed, that is about all you can do. You can suggest therapy and medication, but be careful about how you phrase it and do n o t be forceful about it. However, if your partner recently went through a traumatic event (or something to that effect), it could be a good idea to stabilize (can take about a month from personal experience & observation, sometimes more, sometimes less).

To elaborate on the traumatic event.... I‚Äôm 7 months into a relationship, and last month while my partner was away for 3.5 weeks, my grandfather sent me a nasty, triggering email. I have become unstable. I debated breaking up with him because I didn‚Äôt want to drag him into my shit show any more than I already have. Then, I realized losing him would be the biggest regret of my life, and that i didn‚Äôt have to feel this way, so I decided to go back to therapy and go on meds again (after over a year of being stable, :( sad but necessary). It‚Äôs hard though and sometimes I still feel like I‚Äôm not worthy of love and that my partner deserves so much more (he does though). 

So, I‚Äôd say most of the time, there‚Äôs not much point in waiting. Bipolar is a chemical imbalance and it will continue to rear it‚Äôs ugly head time and time again, but it does not mean we (your partner included) aren‚Äôt worthy of love. We do have to work harder though, and sometimes it‚Äôs easier to live in that instability and deny ourselves stability and happiness, that includes relationships. I suppose my advice overall would be to have a long talk with your partner about what they need from life and from you to make it work."

Welp, he ended up creating some wild false narrative that my relatives bought, and now they refuse to speak to me until I mend the (nonexistent) relationship with my father (I don‚Äôt plan to). The story he told mostly involved claiming that my mother (bipolar I) and grandmother (undiagnosed/in denial about bipolar I) brainwashed me (bpd/bipolar ii)  and my sister (depression/anxiety, really really wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if she had bipolar). 

Beyond that, I was also hospitalized twice in the summer of 2017 due to uncontrollable panic attacks and vomiting due to PTSD. My grandpa visited me, and I read 4 front to back pages full of various abuses that my mother, sister, and I suffered. He seemingly acknowledged it in the hospital, said I could take as much time as I needed to heal and be away from my father. However, his stance changed within a few months, and at every opportunity, he ranted and raved about how I should talk to my father. My grandpa sent an email last month stating that if I don‚Äôt speak to my father, we‚Äôre cut off from the family. He also said that my dead grandmother would be disappointed in my actions. She was like a mother to me (much more than my bio mom, or anyone else) and I have been so triggered that I have to go back on medication after over a year of managing myself. It‚Äôs devastating, but there is nothing to do but try to stabilize again. And again.  

My feelings have continually been minimized, ignored, and considered to be a joke by half of my family, and my mental health is the punchline. 

OP, Family can be unbelievably disappointing, and I‚Äôm sorry your mental health was used against you. I understand how devastating that is, especially when it‚Äôs coming from the people who should always have your back. PM me if you ever want to chat. Seems like we may have a bit in common."

depression,ex41ss3,t1_ex3zw0x,1565996291.0,"A lot of people have undiagnosed problems, and lot of people are diagnosed with problems that could be fixed with therapy/healthy lifestyle/medication, but aren‚Äôt. Healthcare is a bitch (US over here). I hope you‚Äôre able to address your mental health, and get the help you need friend. 

oh god I‚Äôm sorry. I have been smoking weed the last 4 years, but I‚Äôll admit I will occasionally have that anxiety/dissociative response if I smoke when I‚Äôm upset. I‚Äôve found that meditating for a half hour to calm down, and then smoking a bowl and doing some yoga is the best thing for my brain. I‚Äôve been on about 5 different medications and they FUBAR‚Äôed my brain a bit."

depression,ex3xy06,t1_ewu35i6,1565994055.0,"I think that can only be answered on a case by case basis. I dissociate more/less in waves. I also have diagnosed bipolar II, PTSD, OCD, ADHD, panic disorder, phobias, generalized anxiety, trichotillomania, and since I‚Äôve recently started working with a new psych/therapist, I may have BPD or schizoaffective as well. Not to mention trauma in my family and romantic life. So... The healing really hasn‚Äôt been linear but ultimately, yes, it has been better with time but you have to work for that shit my dude"

I can‚Äôt believe I lived like that for a year. I didn‚Äôt give a fuck about anything for 24 hours and had an insane 3 hour BPD episode that involved me crying on the floor, pitying myself (my life is pretty fucked to be fair, and objectively 95% of it has been out of my control), calling a crisis hotline (lost service after 14 min), and then back to crying! sent a couple cryptic, quasi-emo texts to my boyfriend while he‚Äôs away on vacation.... now I‚Äôm eating soup watching love island pretending like it didn‚Äôt happen. yay"
