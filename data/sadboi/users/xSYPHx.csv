AskReddit,fl37dnk,t3_fm1g1g,1584771483.0,"I knew someone who’s parents both had good jobs, and anything her parents wouldn’t get her, her grandparents would.

I don’t want to go into much detail but she wanted to get some kind of job or internship at a place her grandparents were involved with somehow even though she didn’t last a day at her fast food job, so when this place perfect for what she wanted to go into looked at her application / interview her (I don’t really know if she interviewed) she was told she needed at least a year of prior work experience even though she was practically bragging before hand.

She got a job somewhere else and whines about having to work with people, even though the job she wanted was literally interacting with people. 

It’s hard to explain but getting told No and not having everyone bow to you was a bit of a culture shock for her.

TLDR: Girl gets everything she wants, refuses to work fast food, doesn’t get job that would’ve been handed to her. Was shocked and upset about being told no."
