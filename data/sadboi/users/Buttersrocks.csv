stopdrinking,fo5t5os,t1_fo5sqm3,1587534879.0,"Wow that sounds like hell. I’m glad you’re on a different path now. I think the development of this intolerance/allergy or whatever it may be is really a positive thing, i just need to get over my initial disappointment because I enjoy casual drinking a lot but anything more than a beer will just ruin my insides so it’s just not worth it anymore."
Petioles,fm05y7o,t1_flzip9u,1585646025.0,"That’s cool. are/were you a daily user now/then? also did you find the CBD bud to help alleviate the heartburn and nausea of cutting down consumption? I like how you said you can still smoke and be functional, that sounds like where i’d rather be all the time, and in a month or so i’d like to be sprinkling in a little THC bud every once a while again."
Petioles,fm05pz3,t1_flzzqdt,1585645764.0,That sounds promising. what exactly do you mean by edge? i’m no stranger to the emotional turmoil of breaking a long streak of daily smoking but that’s not necessarily my concern anymore. i know exercising and sober socializing are really effective ways for me to deal with that but i’m wondering more specifically about the gastrointestinal symptoms (and appetite; did the CBD weed get you feeling good enough to eat?). It’d be cool to hear a little more about your experience too
Petioles,fm05d69,t1_flzstr4,1585645356.0,"yea my roommate sells weed so i smoke a ton and it’s gotten to an unreasonable point where those CHS symptoms and gnarly heartburn are a given and i so often opt for immediate relief by smoking rather than just enduring a couple days of that. i’m hoping that reducing the THC intake by smoking high CBD/low THC (and i mean as low as i can find) will help alleviate those symptoms. for me that’s kind of the root of a lot of issues, my body just feels so shitty i can’t focus on getting a job and kind of re-socializing myself to people who don’t smoke like my friends and i have for the past several years. It’s hard to do those things when you’re constantly worrying about whether or not you’ll have to dash to the bathroom to vomit or worry about being too high to keep up with others in conversation or even just head space. anyways i hope you find something that helps you out, if i end up trying the CBD flower soon i’ll let you know how it works for those CHS symptoms"

depression,f5zjran,t3_dptepp,1572578622.0,"Days like today are especially hard. I never really liked halloween or any holiday really. I feel like an ass for thinking this but things that bring people together drive me away into my lonesome hidey hole. I get invited to do things, i just can't say yes anymore. All i can do is stay inside and read or try to play music and feel horrible about failing at both."
