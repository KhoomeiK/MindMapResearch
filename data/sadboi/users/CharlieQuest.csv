BPD,fqxi8z8,t3_glfgi4,1589732701.0,"Wow... I could have written this. I love how specific you are.

I hit this kind of rock bottom at the beginning of this year. But I got a lot of good advice from loving people and also figured out a few things myself.

I think the thing that hit me the most is being told I need to start loving myself, cause it's impossible to love someone who hates themselves. I needed to switch my way of thinking about myself completely. Honestly, I did kind of think I was doing everyone a favor by belittling myself like that.... Turns out it was a burden and pain for people I love and for me as well. I'm lucky to have such wise people around me, and I'm also proud of myself for picking to be around such.

I made a conscious decision to love myself and to become someone I like spending time with. I used to shout hateful comments and curses in my head towards myself whenever I did something wrong. I started making thoughts I imagine a loving mom or older sister would make. I tried to treat myself like I try to treat people I love. I even expressed the will to help myself in tasks, however weird it may sound. It changed so much, more than I can express.

I started (back) therapy (I already have an amazing therapist) and home DBT from an app. To address the problems and really work on them, not taking bullshit from myself. I have a Youper app too, where I can do mindfullness. I made a personality test on there (being honest with answers was hard) and it put my features in a different light, and that changed a lot too.

I hated my body, but couldn't get myself to just do exercises. My friend introduced me to a site, where I can do diverse work-out upon clips sent through e-mail by professional trainers three times a week. Work-out at home without anybody looking at me and criticising, or me comparing myself is a blessing. And I felt so much better after 2 weeks, I started to want more.

And I tidied my place, and try to keep it rather clean. I  have a strong feeling of correlation between the state of my apartment and the state of my inner self. Making my apartment clean enough for the visits of my friends made me feel a lot more consistent and in order, and it feels really very good.

The next half of the year in planning to work on my education and a language degree, and possibly a driving license. I feel like it looks so much more possibile from the state I'm in now, comparing to last year.

I'm sorry for the long read. I sincerely hope that any part of this will be helpful.

You can do it, I'm sure of that!"

I wish I would've fought harder before we got separated (we were engaged, but I guess we care for each other too much to just let it go, I guess). The most important thing he told me related to this, is that I need to learn to love myself, for me, care about myself and do things for me.

Here's what I was advised by my therapist and wise friends.

- reality check. What basis do I have to assume this? What was really said and done? What's this person's regular behavior? What makes me not trust him in this situation? Have I ever done anything similar? What was going in my head then?

- it's OK. Having such worries is normal and OK. Don't feel guilty or worse for it. You don't have to act on it, but the feelings and worries themselves are just that, feelings and worries. You're allowed to have them.

- calm verification. Instead of asking who that b**** is, in a South American soap opera tone of voice and piercing eyes (yes, it's an exaggeration), you ask ""A friend of yours?"" and let him develop. Or something like that. At first you do feel like you're passive aggressive in a way, wanting to know totally different things from what you're phrasing, but that will pass. At least it did in my case.

- realize what is your position. Like you'd put it in a headline on New York Times. The facts are that he's with you, he chose you, he wants to keep being with you and he expresses that. Also, everybody has their types, likes to look at beautiful people. Everybody has their choice and usually make them using some logical thinking about what they really want and what's good for them.

- one last thing, there's a trap that I've seen too many people fall in. It's self-fulfilling prophecy. You know what I mean? Even if he doesn't do anything wrong, if you keep your anxiety on the loose, it'll hurt your relationship, which will make both of you feel more and more trapped in this relationship and want out. You know the rest. And the change is simpler than it seems.

I hope you find this helpful.

Maybe I'm saying that because I used to hate and despise myself a lot, until I realized that if I don't fight for myself, noone will, at least not in the deep level that's only possible from the inside.

BPD,fls5sl6,t1_fls4q0r,1585434961.0,"I know it does... Especially when you don't know what the hell is going on and you feel so lost and helpless...

Do you think that one friend could help you out? Or at least tell you what to do to get what you need? Do you have a pharmacy (somewhere where noone will recognize you, as I understand you would never like that) that you could go and explain what's happening and ask for anything they could offer in these circumstances?

And about BPD, there's one kind of therapy mostly recommended, it's called DBT. You can find some resources at r/dbtselfhelp. I hope you can also find some free workbooks in Norwegian to help you get through this time."
AskReddit,fls4krv,t1_flrhgqo,1585434221.0,"I'm trying to eliminate all the negatives, so over ""I don't want that"" I use ""I prefer (want) something else (healthier)"". I know it sounds like bettering what's good, but it made me feel better with myself choosing different and sometimes accually allowing myself a snack in a way, just of a different kind, and also a bit proud of myself and feeling closer and kinder to myself."
BPD,flruhkk,t1_flrs46f,1585428118.0,"Have you got any friends that could help you there in Norway? Or anyone you could trust to help you? Even through a helpline. You could use some help from someone knowing how your healthcare system works and can deal with it at least partly for you to get some load off your back.

I wish you luck and please keep us posted on how it went, I know I can't be of much help and I'm sorry for this, but I want to know you got proper help.

Hugs"
