No, but it's fueled by the sex drive. And OP is having arousal responses (usually coinciding with sex and desire), so yeah it seems like this is that kind of ""like"". 

Just so you know, it's wrong to make judgements and criticisms about others based on gender, or race, or sexual preferences, culture, etc..., especially in the context of a discussion or conversation. When you do that, I hope you realize it makes the other person dismiss you as ignorant and unable to provide anything of value to the conversation.

NoStupidQuestions,fr1oodx,t1_fr1lib1,1589823351.0,"Fantasy remains in fantasy, once you start to act on it its no longer fantasy.

What's wrong is its a personal connection that's being developed for a sexual, fetishised reason. Porn works well because you don't have a direct one-to-one connection, influence, or interaction with the individual. Once it crosses that boundary, it's cheating.

Also, it really depends on what the agreed upon relationship expectations are. If they determine it is cheating, then it is. The beauty of being a human being is you get to develop responsibility and commitments, which yeah, maybe limit yourself but lead to significant benefits. You don't get to do whatever you want, disregarding how it would impact others around you, and then be confused or mad that the other person has a reaction to it that you didn't like. You may not label it cheating, but if your partner does, good luck feeling ""morally superior"" when you watch them leave and slander your name as a cheater. Cheating essentially means you went beyond the boundaries of the relationship 

You don't exist in a bubble. Your actions have an impact on others around you. You also have control over your actions, you may not control your interests or desires but to act on them is not ""human"". To be human is many things,  I don't believe it includes ""forgo higher levels of thought and reason and only act upon base instinctual drives"""

However, if their husband wanted to have a threesome with a woman involved and the man enjoyed licking the woman's clit while his husband fucks her, is he also bisexual?

Compared to the first man I described, they are both called bisexual but one prefers men and one prefers women. It's not a very good term if what it describes can relate to desire for a man or woman.
