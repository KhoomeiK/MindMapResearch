StonerThoughts,flazifv,t3_fngvu2,1584994290.0,It’s kinda busty if you have a fat tolerance but I’d get a dugout and an one hitter. Shit does wonders to converse your dank
RationalPsychonaut,fiiuwh2,t3_f7wqp4,1582427498.0,Maybe try buying a one hitter and ration yourself out it’s hella easier with a one hitter
drums,ficlhzi,t3_f7lulj,1582351137.0,"I have the same drum, and god do I love it it’s my prize possession. I have a chrome rim on the bater so I don’t scuff it up at all"
Exercise,fhycz4f,t3_f2wn3f,1581973406.0,Drumming actually is a decent exercise! If you’re playing high intensity or simply busy music then you are going to build some muscles in your legs and arms; abs too if you activate them for balance. It’s also a solid source of cardio. You won’t really notice much muscle building but you’ll definitely get a little bigger in those areas and you’ll notice some toning
Survival,fg3jdnt,t1_fg3gylp,1580482944.0,That’s the only reason I use it pretty much or like I need to gut a wrap or something else
bugout,fc7njif,t1_fbr6xz5,1577513416.0,Suh dude just you friendly stoner coming through. If you buy a bic lighter I’d recommend popping the safety off. You can just do it by taking either a knife or other flat object and prying the metal hoop for the flint; it makes it overall easier to light. I’d also check hemp wick you can cut a string off and tie it around the bottom of your lighter I dunno if it has much use in a survival situation though but it does give you a tasty hit
