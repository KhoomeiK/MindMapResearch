My professors are trying to continue the semester as if there‚Äôs not a fuckin pandemic going on. I miss my cohort, as I‚Äôve met some of my closest friends through school. We all talk often, and the majority are struggling. I‚Äôm also trying to keep up with taking my meds but I forget and then feel more like shit. All I really know is that I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever take advantage of being able to grab coffee with a friend, have a beer at the bar, and sit around a fire with my pals just shooting the shit. 

To help cope, I‚Äôve been going for lots of walks, spending as much time as I can outside, trying to be as productive as possible to finish up the semester, puzzles, playing new instruments, cooking/baking, and doing virtual coffee and tea dates with my pals. I know there‚Äôs a long road ahead, but with support and recognizing healthy coping mechanisms, we can all make it through this. Take care of yourselves!
