But I‚Äôve also worked with NPs who seemed to have a chip on their shoulder towards all doctors and believed they knew better because of their experience as a nurse. But what it comes down to is the fact that they did not go through 4 years of post college education and at least 3 years of residency to become a doctor. It‚Äôs that simple. Therefore, they do not get to be called a doctor.

We actually had a health policy block that was very anti-physician and promoted mid-level creep. It was quite frankly disgusting and I was honest about how terrible I thought the course was at the end.

Also there was a post here recently about a resident venting because an NP essentially dumped a patient on them for a consult without doing any work prior or even writing a decent note.
