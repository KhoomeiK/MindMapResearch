depression,fc36hjl,t3_effx75,1577382625.0,"I woke up sobbing 3 years back on christmas morning when I was homeless sleeping outside with a peacoat on, I was so cold that morning. Now I'm not homeless, but because i am poor and dont talk to family anymore, Christmas is still depressing for me. No tree no gifts from anyone, not even hardly any food in the kitchen...so i slept most the day to let it pass. Hang in there. It could be alot worse you know, find something to distract yourself from your sad thoughts if it's too much to bear."

It should have happened alot sooner, but I finally got the the gumption to upgrade from the homeless tent life I was in, but live in a ghetto ass room and board with a slum lord and over pay now stuck in this new dramatic gong show living situation. I'm fed up with having to think of leaving my home state because of gentrification. I dont think my life is going any further then down this negative pattern of having nothing to look forward to."

depression,fbkh10l,t3_edpkii,1576950211.0,"Yes, it stems from holding on to my past too often. That's why I like having having a healthy outlet, which is hard to stay in sync with if you have unhealthy habits as well. Bottomline is your either gonna be a rotten pessimist or some other issue with not getting to the root of yourself by seeking help or examining your unhealthy ways of dealing with how you see the world and how you function socially in society."

Ie: Answers, Hopburg Hop, Hump, Freaks, Venison, Can't Even Breathe, Some People, Like Linus are my personal favs from the early b-sides/demos. 

Wish they would recap some live footage with these titles, which would be rare but a nice chunky treat for sure."

Don't say much, it will get you further then I got, they're like wolves ready to hunt prey, and nice, sheltered folk like me or maybe you that don't know the life of the street very well will be tricked in more ways than one, and they will go at it non stop...be careful who yo unm talk to, and don't tell your life story, it's a waste of effort, cos no one really cares about your story, they only care about theirs."
depression,f8unze8,t3_e1zc9s,1574836259.0,"Its not healthy or me to feel that way, but sometimes i wished that god didnt wake me up this morning,. I cant ungratefully grasp that and go on with life like its all good and gravy. We have are hard days and our Still moments, and they're our ambitious productive days. The power of negative thinking will be overpowering to make your life just how you make it, if you want to be miserable, then be wallowing in your misery but dont doubt that for one moment it could be way worse then you have it, and learn to be more grateful for being here everyday even though we have our bad and worse ones.. i know how it can get, i aint hardly go shit to look forward to, so might as well try to live it as comfortably as i can make it. I always quoted, ""consider less comforts"", to keep me going when i was down on my life and shortcomings. I had to dig fo positivity to keep it moving cos no one else can do that for me but me."

So over-rated if you dont have anyone to celebate with, but for the busy bodies, i guess attending the x-mas parties dont seem so bad. All you pretty much gotta do is just show up..call me a lazy holiday spirit. i hate this time of year, too much commercial hassle."

Then i started feeling pointless again..like why am i trying after having tried to start over so many times? I can really relate to the down way you are feeling, and yes maybe we all need support,but isolation can get you stagnate to the social part of your life your not a people person like me. i'm 35, dropped out of college, don't work, but can pay rent with SSA.  If you have no one to talk to about this shit, it sucks that we have to turn to reddit to be heard and related upon one anothers experiences. Hope all turns out for the best."
