But by the end it had become clear that he's being really thick headed about this.  He isn't doing independent research.  He isn't trying to understand you.  He's acting like this is some silly game, and he's laughing at you when you push past your own hangups to help him.  

I would take BDSM off the table until he demonstrates that he can lead a session capably.  He can read articles, reach out to other Doms as mentors on FetLife, and learn to listen to you without judgement.  

The only thing that you might consider giving him at this point is an explanation.  ""I bared my soul, and you laughed at me.  It's going to take time and work before I feel safe opening up again.""

Tell him that before he can push your boundaries, you must first discover them yourself.  How else will he know where it is safe to push?  You can discover much of this through conversation, and it can be a lot of fun to have!  And if ultimately your answer to a proposed scene is, ""I'm not sure I can handle it, but I'm down to try with safewords in place and an agreed on aftercare routine"" - THAT is what the green light to push you looks like.  ""I don't know - but I trust you enough to try.""

When partners opt out of communication, that leaves you to make choices alone.  In this case, since you clearly know he's at capacity and can't handle it, I think you need to give *yourself* permission to suspend the rules until he brings it up again himself.  And the best way to communicate that, since he can't engage, is just to inform him.  ""Since we are both under so much stress, I wanted to let you know that the BDSM is back burnered until you feel ready to extend yourself again.  No pressure.  I love what we have and I will wait patiently.  Just say the word and I will be here and ready to submit to you.""

You seem to be focused on that one sentence.  I think I may see where our opinions diverse.  While OP's Dom took verbal responsibility and acknowledged his role in this mishap, he had been avoidant of this issue (guilty looks, guilting her after she broke the rule rather than responding either in dynamic with whatever agreed upon consequence should have followed, or an out of dynamic talk) and it took OP's fuck up to make him acknowledge that his real life burden renders him incapable of meeting OP's needs.

Your contract wasn't written in these conditions, and I very much doubt it was written with these conditions in mind. It is fair to need an occasional rewrite under the best of circumstances, even if only temporary.  You needed to ask your Dom to release you from those rules, because they were hurting you. 

But you are here now.  I think you need to have the conversation still.  He needs to take responsibility for being less available.  The fact that you're happy to have an occasional solo session could be better viewed as a relief.  It would serve you both better for him to return that power to you, for now.

Ironically his reaction has the unintended result of encouraging you to keep doing just that.  This is a difficult conversation, because conversations about compatibility can quickly become conversations about ending the relationship.  Some people act irrationally when confronted with the possibility of triggering abandonment anxiety, and in some cases they act in ways that trigger their partner to shut down and withdraw like you describe.  Your incompatibility could be navigated in a healthy relationship; but his behaviors are manipulative and not healthy.

There's some red flags here to think about.  It's okay to try out being monogamous.  But for your partner to make you cut contact with partners from the past who they feel threatened by is controlling and can be a warning sign for emotional abuse (if you can't have an emotional connection with anyone else, you are especially vulnerable to abuse, because just neglecting you in that situation will have a terrible impact.)

BDSMAdvice,fiu4og3,t3_f9v6hf,1582735087.0,"For me personally, expecting daily messages in a LDR is a pretty high bar to set; I'm not saying it's too high, but I would be open to the idea that you are asking for a significant amount of effort and depending on what he has going on in his life, he may not always be able to meet it.  

I'd start by examining the language you use to describe this to him.  If someone informed me that my communication had ""gone to shit"", I would find myself fighting to smooth some ruffled feathers, and that can make it difficult to communicate effectively.  You already recognize that you can't control his behavior, so it's best to focus on facts and feelings.  ""When you relax on the messaging routine we've built after meetings with your sub, I feel ignored and alone.  Can we work together to find a solution?"" 

My guess is that he may not be able to keep up the patterns that the two of you have established surrounding his time with other partners, but that he still cares and can at least give you a heads up of when to expect less from him.  I suspect that you would respect that if it were caused by work, school, or any other number of necessary pastimes, so it makes sense to extend the same courtesy to other partners."
DID,fiu0qgt,t3_f9v4xz,1582733156.0,"How would you behave if Sunny was a younger sibling or your child?

My gut is telling me that when it comes to younger alters, sometimes we need to take action that we know is best for them, even if it isn't what they want.  

One of my headmates is struggling with something similar, although we have moved on to some extent.  We are poly and one of our partners broke up with us at the end of 2018.  Some of us just felt pure anger and hatred, but others felt confused and heartbroken.  A couple of us still dearly miss him and when that intense feeling of loss strikes, the best thing for our system is to remind those parts of the negative aspects about our ex and the relationship.  I think I'd be doing the same with Sunny, in your shoes.  Be compassionate, acknowledge her feelings, and then remind her that you have a different perspective that is also valid.  Personally I would opt for a pretty controlled approach and cut off communication, as it doesn't sound like she would be able to balance wildly contradictory accounts and your ex is an established liar."

Idk if I'm just the odd duck, but I *hate* the feeling of anal fingering - giving or receiving - and vibration is pretty much the only way I can relax and stretch without pain.  There's even vibrating plugs designed for people with prostates, which is ideal because you definitely want something designed for anal play (mostly to avoid losing a toy in your butt).  Good luck!"
BDSMAdvice,fi0z3fw,t3_f5lq6c,1582047530.0,"I have a preference for older partners.  It is partly because I find the age gap to be taboo and hot, but it's also because I notice that older people aren't dealing with the same struggles that I am, and often it's because they've worked through those things and have come out the other side stronger and wiser.  I love learning from others, and I find that this aspect can enhance a D/s relationship in a way that resonates deeply with me.  

I've also learned to recognize red flags in older partners.  Grooming themed compliments - like flattery about how mature I am for my age - get me paranoid.  I think about how I perceive people who are younger than me, and it helps put things in perspective.  I don't want my age to be fetishized either.  It can add some spice to acknowledge the gap, but I don't want that to be what initially attracts us to each other.  I also don't want it used against me in a coercive way (e.g., ""You're young, you don't know what is best for you/what you really need"").  Most importantly, if a D-type starts to hint or suggest that I would be better off reliant on them, I am out.  My life has been a series of battles for independence, and the last thing I want is to be so closely entwined with another person that losing them would harm me and my ability to function."
DID,fi0p28d,t1_fi0mmna,1582041849.0,"Breaking up with you and hurting himself are not under your control.  Nothing that you do, whether it is suppressing Roy's agency or allowing him freedom, will control your boyfriend's decision.  For all you know, he might just get tired of your system being in conflict regarding the relationship and break up for that reason.  There is no way to guarantee the love of others; so to me, it makes the most sense to extend love to system mates, rather than suppressing them with the hope of securing external affection.  

While polyamory is difficult, I don't think there's any way to enforce a law against it (unlike bigamy, which is what I assume you mean.)  That said, I can respect that you don't feel it's a sustainable choice for your system.  

I can't tell you what to do, but the quickest way to finding peace is to find it internally first.  You can continue to deny Roy the aspects of life that he desires.  Or you can embrace that you share a body, and that you are permanent fixtures in each other's lives.  You will find external happiness much more easily once you learn to create it within yourself, by treating all parts of your system equitably."

Because there are so many differences between you, it doesn't sound like you could share a relationship as things currently stand.  Since you both want to date, the best solution for your system would probably be to research polyamory.  There's no guarantee that your boyfriend would want to be in a poly relationship, and I get that this can feel very messy.  

Another question to explore - why do you feel so angry at the thought of Roy having a relationship?"

Idk the age of your little, but if they enjoy kids TV, there are some good episodes on this topic - Daniel Tiger's ""Grown-ups Come Back"" song comes to mind.  

Following that, come up with a list of feel-good distraction activities that she can use during these times.  Sometimes being alone feels bad because of FOMO, especially if you're home alone.  Having planned activities for yourself can help combat that aspect.  

Basically, you're positively reinforcing the shit out of being alone until being left doesn't trigger the fear of abandonment so strongly.  It's going to take time and be gradual progress, but it is well worth the work."

Definitely keep checking in, both with your Dom and yourself, to come up with new things to explore, but only the two of you can determine what you're into and what to try next.

As a sadomasochist, sadism is more attractive to me than most primary sexual traits.  There are plenty of people out there who love what you have to offer.  Just because it is unique and not as commonly sought after as some traits, does not make it less valuable.  

Having played with multiple service tops who were willing to inflict pain without it being their kink, there is a very real and incredible difference in playing with an actual sadist who gets something out of it.  Love yourself for being you."

That said, if your fantasies make you uncomfortable or you are literally afraid you will hurt yourself or another person or animal by losing control, then yeah, seek therapy.  Otherwise?  Dream away, and enjoy the incredible connection you have with your partner.  

One thing I will say, as someone who was raised in a fundie cult with similar beliefs around women being submissive to their husbands, I think it's good to examine our desires and where they originated.  It sounds like you have a healthy perspective on it all and that you have chosen what makes you happy, but it's also good to remember your own context, especially if you ever start to feel like you're doing things that make you uncomfortable.  Sometimes the feeling of having no limits is essentially from being raised not to have/voice them.  Again - this doesn't sound like what you've shared here, but also the way you described freaking out about your own fantasies is literally how others might describe recognizing a limit.

Also, this seems to be just me, but in my experience coconut oil (and oils in general) don't provide sufficient lubrication.  They just don't feel slick enough and there's too much friction.

It's possible your friend enjoys her relationship but struggles with confrontation.  This would lead her to complain to you constantly without ever addressing any issues with her partner.  

It's also possible she's in a bad relationship.  

All you can do is be supportive.  Rather than being judgemental or trying to force her to admit things are bad, offer her help.  Give her names of therapists or mental health clinics.

Seeking permission to leave the house might have been an agreed on part of your dynamic at one time, but she is telling you that it can't be moving forward, because it makes her feel like she is parenting you (that's what I gather from the ""acting childish"" comment, anyhow.) 

I'm guessing you don't want your partner to feel that way.  But she also has to accept that if she has enabled this codependency for some time, it is going to be a difficult transition for you to take on independence in those areas.  While she does not owe you this, it would be kind of her to help you come up with ways to help you feel more confident in making these decisions for yourself, and that is something you can request of her - but also be open to hearing ""No"".

You then realized you actually needed to safeword to get the reassurance you needed from him out of dynamic, because his attempt to keep the scene going left you unclear as to whether he understood.  

As for moving forward, it sounds like you both need to practice being able to share your feelings even when it feels like too much.  The way you both push each other away (you by calling an end to the scene, him by leaving you to smoke) when you get overwhelmed seems to really hurt each other.  It's ok to ask for space when you need it, but this feels more like ""you need to be away from me"" than ""I need a minute for myself."" 

And then also try to determine whether you need a discussion out of dynamic vs. in.  If your attempts to set boundaries in-scene is going to be interpreted as topping from the bottom, then he's going to have to understand that that is going to mean you end up safewording more often so that you can be heard.
