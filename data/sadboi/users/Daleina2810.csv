She also one tooth which is longer and has a poisonous string. But the tooth is only visible when she opens her mouth widely. The snake features are inspired by green mambas.

worldpolitics,fajwlk1,t1_faj8enr,1576156232.0,"Well from my point of view a good healthcare is not something one has to earn from hard work. It is a human right. I understand that you feel its a bit unfair but dont you think that everyone should be able to pay for medical care that is necessary for his survival? Not everyone is able to work in a hard job because of 1) there are not that many jobs which are paid well which is another problem in this society. 2) Everyone has different capabilities. 3) some are born ill and will never be able to work like a healthy person. Should these people just be neglected? 4) most poor people cant afford a good education which mostly leads to a job that is not paid that well.
I think there are lot of things which need to be considered in this topic."

And please dont say that its their one fault. This is just you trying to find a dumb reason to not have to acknowledge the hard truth. Please about your words.
worldpolitics,fai4ybs,t3_e99p40,1576099935.0,"Probably gonna be downvoted for this but I need to speak my mind. I actually really dont get why people are always so fed up with Sanders thoughts and statements. Yes he is quite left. And yes he is quite a socialist. But dont his points seem logical to you? Dont you think that having free medical care is a human right for everyone? Please explain to me with good reasons why this is such an awful idea. I dont mean to argue, I just want some insight on your thoughts."

Its just that in other countries its not always like that."
CasualConversation,faesqxq,t3_e8uk5z,1576007410.0,You did nothing wrong! Your mum can be proud of your strength to tell her. I am sure this most have been really tough. It is sad that parents sometimes still do not accept their children when they come out. But you did not change in any way. You were like this before and she loved you. There is no reason for her to not love you anymore. You are still an amazing son and she should be really proud and thankful to have a son like you! I hope she will recognize this. Please dont think bad of yourself. I wish you only the best

WomensHealth,fadg6om,t1_fabwakp,1575969800.0,Well these days I often feel anxious because of the stress

It depends if you are training or in a competition. Its safer for your partner if you go slowly backwards and start bending the arm. In a competition its better to go quickly because the risk of your opponent escaping wont be so high."
offmychest,f8q4uhx,t3_e1gsay,1574712144.0,I am so sorry you have to go through this. I sheded some tears reading your post. I am not gonna say its okay because it clearly is not. But with the help of a professional you will be able to move forward and keep her in good memories. I am sure she would want you to be okay so maybe keep that in mind and take care of yourself. She would want you to keep on living. I cannot imagine how hard this must be and I share my deepest condolences with you. I wish you the strength to overcome your stage of denial of this tragedy and that you can move on to real mourning with professional help.

relationship_advice,f8pjfwe,t3_e1dzo2,1574702501.0,I think the decision you had to make was really difficult and i totally understand that you were shocked and needed some time to figure out what to do. In the end you did the right thing. So everyone here should stop blaming you for reacting how you did. Your former best friend is the one to blame and not you! So please everyone stop blaming her. OP already feels guilty enough. Also she is doing everything she can now to help.

worldpolitics,f7y2il7,t1_f7y2e5a,1574084560.0,Well i am honestly sorry for stating this false fact. But its still true that its easier to buy guns and be able to have a gun in the USA than in Austria for example.
worldpolitics,f7y0g5s,t1_f7xtjpw,1574082662.0,I am from Austria and yes we do have guns. And yes we rarely have school shootings.But the difference is how you can get a gun. Its not that easy here. You need to get special training and do some tests. Not like in the USA where you can buy guns and patrons almost everywhere. So I do think it has to do with gun control. Of course it is a cultural problem as well and people need to realise that guns dont solve problems.

mentalhealth,f7ugwlw,t3_dxmaj9,1574014708.0,"No! You are definitely not a bad person. You have a mental disorder that needs to be treated like any other physical or mental condition. From my point of view drugs and alcohol were your ways to deal with all of this. Also because it all started at a very young age. I cant even begin to imagine how it must feel. I deeply feel sorry for you having to go through this. Maybe you could tell the people around you that every disorder needs treatment and to make sure you will get better and get rid of alcohol and drug abuse a therapy is absolutely necessary. I really hope they will understand and stay by your side. Wish you only the best!

relationship_advice,f7uep0p,t3_dxnfru,1574014137.0,Actually I can understand your anger really well because I would be mad as well. But because I love my partner I would also be really concerned and text him to ask where he is. I think it’s important to try to understand your significant other even if you dont agree with their choice. Maybe the phone didn’t have any battery left. There could be millions of reasons and the only thing to find out the truth is to reach out to her. I hope it will all turn out good for both of you.

mentalhealth,f6jhayx,t1_f6iva3t,1572894711.0,"Well as you said, it can help. If you are a religious person. But if you arent, comments relating to praying are not helpful at all. They can even make this person’s problem feel less worthy. Because mental problems need to be treated by a psychologist. I am sorry if this is offending anyone but a educated psychologist can treat and also heal a mentally ill person. But God or praying can only (maybe) make you feel better but this doesnt help you in processing the cause of the illness, which is essentiel for curing. It also doesnt offer you tipps on how to deal with whatever mental disorder you suffer from. Long story short: Without professional help most mentall illnesses cant be overcome. Praying can only be additional support but definetely not the only one."
