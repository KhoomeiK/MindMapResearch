KentStateUniversity,fpelx6v,t3_gd0shd,1588550096.0,"To answer the question (based upon what I have taught and not having read the article): many of them were members of Black United Students and were warned to stay away. Unlike most of the protestors, they had prior experience with how law enforcement treated protestors, especially those who were colored, and how things likely could turn out. They felt the risk was too high.

Why did they not tell the other protestors? Because the other protestors were not black, and they likely were in much less danger (from their perspective).

After reading it: it's pretty much the same, though this article does say there was a plan for African American students to join the protest around noon, but ""they imagined they‚Äôd be easy targets"" for the guard. Probably true, had they been present it is likely they would have been targeted during the shooting."

Anecdotally (as I don't have a source, though I'm pretty sure this is true), I think almost every step of the recycling system is flawed/inefficient and corrupt to cover that fact.

I got a very large part of my degree done at a much cheaper price, and got a scholarship at Kent for having an associates completed (2k a year, 1k per semester). So personally I really recommend doing something like that--if you find the satellite campus good enough for you, consider staying longer than the 12 credit hours. 

And then another Pro tip: online courses then can be taken from other satellite campuses, no matter the campus you are at. That advice will be very important if this quarantine shite keeps up and people still want to keep working on their degree. In person summer classes have already been cancelled, so...
