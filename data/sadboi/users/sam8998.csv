I do pay my Bill's, I had one default which was bell and I paid off. Like calm the fuck down.

Anxiety,fp7h4oy,t1_fp78jig,1588370520.0,"That’s amazing thank you so much for this response. Oh trust me I catch myself laughing all the time, if I don’t laugh I’ll just sob..2020 has been by far the worst. I have been through some crazy shit last few years and I guess this was the icing on the cake. I never felt this close to such a psychotic break? I try to keep myself in a routine but It’s tough. Before I moved into condo I had a home gym in basement which I had to sell, now I feel so bloody out of whack and routine and no gyms are open so that part isn’t helping much. Like I said I know everybody is hurting and I’m just having a pity party for myself it’s just so hard not to lol. I’m sorry that you had tough times, And I do hope things work out for you as well! I’ll keep laughing, I’ll do my best to keep myself in check :)"

Anxiety,fmfs2pp,t3_fv0nbe,1586033670.0,Had that feeling for the last month. Great isn’t it? :( Do you get a feeling that you a trapped in your body and in general and can’t escape?
Anxiety,fmfpdgx,t3_fuzdps,1586032073.0,"It’s easy to say you are not alone in this, and it’s going to be ok but they are only words and I’m sure you are at a point as I have come to where we need more then words at this point to help get some sort of certainty  and relief. Unfortunately that’s kind of hard, so what I will say is. Take it day by day. Get a routine going, keep your mind busy so you don’t get lost in thoughts leading to panic. We are going through a crazy time in the world and our lives are changing everyday. Again, try get a routine, ground yourself as best as possible. If you ever need to chat, give me a shout until then keep yourself safe, healthy as best as possible and know, IT WILL BE OK, anxiety and panic does pass. :) hang in there op"

alberta,fmbg2ba,t1_fmacxsr,1585925640.0,"It’s frustrating when my landlord is in a sheer panic as all of us are but isn’t following proper procedure. Has the realtor knocking at my door at 8:30 asking to do a viewing at 11 am following morning. I said I’d rather not have anybody in the unit right now as I’ve been keeping isolated as much as possible because I’m still working (construction) and not to mention he keeps giving me less then 24 hour notice. I’m trying to cooperate but my landlord isn’t even taking my health into factor or anything. But yes! It does all suck, just venting lol"
Anxiety,fmbfkj2,t3_fu4pox,1585925352.0,"You aren’t alone! This whole event has put a wedge in so many peoples lives. I can totally relate to you. I literally just got back on my feet in January, and within a matter of weeks my life has been ripped up beneath me. Just remember (for me it helps) you are not alone in this. It all sucks, it sucks bad and the uncertainty on what lies ahead for all of us will spike our anxieties to the max BUT remember again, you are not alone in this. When you wake up in the morning just remember you are still breathing, we are still alive and all we can do right now is to continue breathing when everything else is crashing around us, BREATHE <3 stay strong op and everybody else"

Calgary,flelz69,t1_flekq89,1585086934.0,Oh yea I asked for my damage back and first month rent but true colours are shining bright right now. He’s not wanting to help me in anyway and I don’t have time or energy to go chasing after him for money. It’s all panic right now lol

alberta,flb7gvw,t1_flaxowh,1584998937.0,"It’s horse shit, excuse my language but it is. He lives in Vancouver so he probably saw that evictions were being put on hold certain provinces and he wants to get me out before they hold on Alberta. Pretty fuckin low if u ask me, considering I was cooperating while he was doing the showings and me keeping the house in mint condition. True colours are showing bright now that’s for sure, fuck em"

alberta,flao3p1,t1_flal9cc,1584987718.0,But in his eviction notice he says he is moving into the property himself (so he’s saying) which by law can’t they do that if a family memeber was moving in? Plus he gave me notice today and states I need to be put by the 4th is that even proper two weeks notice?
