Kidnap her and her family. She's tied in a chair in front of her family as the back wall of the room her family is closing in. Then when her family is crushed. I whisper in her ear ""You could've saved them had you not done what you did, you end a life I end yours"". I then bring out pliers and nails. I shove the nails into hers then pull her nails out with the pliers. As a final goodbye I say ""Welcome to the result of your actions"" as I leave her in a pitch dark damp room with her flattened family on the wall of an adjacent room. Her mind slowly degrading as her imagination runs wild with what might be in the dark.

A good way to get karma ( from what I understand ) are reposts (which are looked down upon if you notice something on here that you've seen before then it most likely is a repost) and posting things that relate to the theme of the subreddit, which leads me to your next question. You can find posts about gaming on r/Gaming. Though I've never tried, you can get upvotes there by posting things like hard achievement screenshots or a video of yourself reacting to a certain moment or fanart. If your son has a preferred game or game dev company then there are subreddits for those as well. r/PS4 r/nintendo r/xbox or r/xboxone. I hope this helps?"
