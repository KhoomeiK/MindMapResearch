If you feel like you need inpatient treatment, you probably need it and if I were you and could go back in time and not lose 3 years of my life fucked up on benzos and alcohol, I'd surely go for it. 


In any case, I hope you'll be safe.


P.S.: I have horrible paranoid thoughts sometimes, for example that the doctors are stealing my ""true thoughts and emotions"" (whatever that means) and that they actively want me to suffer and be fucked up, but I can tell you from my experience (in Germany if it matters), doctors take psychosis *very* seriously especially if it's coupled with suicidal thoughts. Yes, seeking help is absolutely terrifying, but sometimes it's the only way out of a horrible, horrible rabbit hole. I hope you can make the step, even if you're paranoid as me, I hope you can get your brain to agree to let people help you and to trust them by letting them help you and being honest. I wish you all the best, OP.


P.P.S.: Schizotypal, the way I see it, is in its own a cluster of disorders (depression, anxiety, psychosis, dissociation, et cetera), so if you feel like the dots connect and ""schizo-something"" is something that may fit you, you should definitely bring this up to your doctors. Most of the time it makes more sense than diagnosing you with 5 different things, when just 1 thing covers most of the symptoms."

But this is exactly the problem. I don't want to run a jokey meme campaign with constant avengers references.

Look, basically there's no easy way to do this. Alcohol and benzos act on the same receptors on the brain. Both will set each other back, and the only guaranteed way to a successful taper is to kick the alcohol too. If you're dependent on alcohol, you might also wanna taper the alcohol, cause benzo WDs and alcohol WDs are very very similar, and very very shitty. 

If your taper is supervised, please contact your doctor about it. 

There's a way out of this, but you'll have to buckle the fuck up and prepare yourself. Drink lots of water too. Try to trick your brain by drinking literally anything else other than alcohol: tea, juice, hell even fucking dr pepper will be better. Tell the cravings to fuck off, go for a big walk instead or a run, keep yourself occupied and focused on something else. 

If you're gonna drink anyway, keep it to a minimum, just have a beer or just one shot of your preferred alcohol. If you've experienced alcohol WDs before, at least you know what you're in for, both for the alcohol and for the kpin.

Also 2mg for your first dose? I'm not sure what the recreational dose would be (I was on 2mg at the peak of my script, and when I went off the rails, I ended up doing 6-7 daily), but jumpin Jesus, that sounds like it's too much. There's a reason Xanax scripts start at .25-.50 man. If you're anything like me (I understand not all are, but my experience is a common one), be careful with that shit, bro. Benzos can make you go full retarded and you don't wanna go full retarded."

The super grammatical correct way to write this would've been ""œÄŒªŒÆŒΩ ·ΩßŒΩ, ·ºÖ...."" but removing either the genitive or the accusative from this construction would both be very common in classical Greek."

It's been around 13 months since then. I still get WDs, but the hellish part was the first month. Good Lord, that first month I wouldn't wish on my worst enemies."
