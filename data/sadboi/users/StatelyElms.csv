But anyway, I found a group of really nice people that asked if I'd like to sit with them at my second round of exams, with some longtime acquaintances in it. (My relationship with one of them is complicated and embarrassing, but for the sake of space I'll skip it). I forced myself to hang out with them every morning before school despite feeling like I was just being clingy and irritating, and then during the next semester I hung out with them at lunch. I felt way more accepted and part of a group, but still didn't feel right.

This year, I had a FILA class with some of their friends and we got together at lunch, between classes, just before pushing after school, etc. Hung out outside of school for the first time (somebody invited me to trick-or-treating) and then as a group. Made a group chat that's active a lot... it's nice feeling accepted! Having people aside from my family that I can rely on a chat with is awesome. It requires some big pushes, but trust me, it's worth it.

And I finally understand why noon-hour detention is a punishment.

TL;DR: found a group whose personality mixed well with mine. It grew, and as it grew, I felt more accepted."

Speaking of friends, or rather, making friends, you do have to put yourself out there. If it's too hard to say ""hey, can I hang out with you guys at lunch?"" then make some small talk first. Get to know them. Even if it takes a year for you to say that to them, and another year to actually open up, it's worth it. You can do it.

And remember that you may not mix with everyone perfectly. You can wait until you meet a group that mixes well, or you can try and see if there's a different person under the surface.
