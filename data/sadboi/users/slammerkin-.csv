iamatotalpieceofshit,fkwhryu,t1_fkupmdo,1584592883.0,It sure does. I had compressions performed on me a year ago by my boyfriend (led by 911 operator) and then paramedics and it snapped the cartilage that connects ribs to sternum right off.  Was a bitch to heal from though.
BPD,fjoqgv3,t3_feiih5,1583532854.0,This means you havent fully resolved your traumas..you just arent being triggered. I'm the same way. It's all there lurking still.
BPD,fjopqez,t1_fjom4xg,1583532465.0,"Regardless of BPD, your relationship sounds toxic. You need to set healthy boundaries or leave the situation. Bpd is a reason.. not an excuse. It does not force her to do or say cruel things. Thats emotional immaturity. Now it's not her fault she has BPD but it is her responsibility to heal and manage her reactions. Do not set yourself on fire to keep her warm."

AskWomen,fgl566x,t1_fgk8f05,1580882377.0,"Oh god. The landmark crap. I believe it's a good concept but my bf definitely applied it incorrectly to situations and it felt really invalidating. When he did something that I genuinely had the right to be upset over he would always say ""you're choosing to see it that way"" and something about how I'm creating stories in my head.  Finally about 7 months in he realised how he was using it and has stopped.  Man I forgot about that. Damn landmark."

BPD,f1cjhtn,t3_d8k8fn,1569358869.0,My therapist calls it otherreacting. So sometimes when it comes up I let my partner know I am otherreacting not overreacting.
AmItheAsshole,f0wv9ke,t1_f0wcwgj,1569014728.0,Woof. That was painful. Whatever happened to a sense of community.
BPDmemes,f0wibp4,t1_f0w8re8,1569008045.0,A search on trauma bonding should send you in the right direction.
ptsd,f0whbje,t1_f0wdltw,1569007528.0,Absolutely without a doubt considered trauma. And it sounds like you have PTSD. I myself have those symptoms when someone gets angry around me because of when I was in an abusive relationship. I have C-PTSD myself.
Methadone,f0v1302,t3_d6olh4,1568958478.0,"Welcome to the club and congratulations! Take a moment to be proud of yourself it's a huge achievement to come off!  By the sounds of it I don't think you don't have anything to worry about and can stop waiting for the bomb to drop. 40mg is the starting dose for every clinic I have gone to, so that combined with how slowly you did it I would be surprised if you were hit with anything major. I myself was on it 7 years, max dose 130mg and went from 75mg to 0mg in 3 months and even then it was only a rough few weeks.  A lot of it is the fear of withdrawals. Go enjoy your freedom!"
BabyBumps,ezxenq0,t1_ezwb289,1568238600.0,"It helps for sure but its mostly a just you luck out or don't kind of thing. Babies are used to the loud noise at first, the womb is very very loud. But I know plenty of babies that once the 4 month sleep regression hit they never slept deep or long stretches again.  I was always loud and never had a dark room. Didn't help. Took till he was about 10 months for him to not be such a light sleeper.  
My friend was so proud about how loud she could be with her first and he only woke up once throughout the night from birth. Super heavy sleeper.  She was convinced it was her efforts that did it. She had a second and did all the same things.. that baby is up every couple of hours and wakes up from a pin drop. Shes horrified lol."
relationship_advice,eza8e1g,t1_eza6dp8,1567796646.0,"Its definitely a lot more common than people realise. This is anecdotal of course, but its funny, the people I have met in real life that have such a strong reaction to it are the people who have never actually been cheated on.   The ones who have understand the pain and some did choose to walk away but they can comprehend the complexity of it and not be so rigid in the way they think."
relationship_advice,eza5jfz,t1_ez9vjae,1567795276.0,"Any cheating post is always the same. Leave. They will do it again. They are lying and it's been going on for a long time.   I usually dont read them anymore for this reason.  It's always oversimplified with black and white thinking. Very little growth in this category. 
 And yes I've been cheated on.  My current partner even cheated on me and we are currently pregnant with our second. No he never did it again and no he's not an exception to the rule.  Sometimes shit happens but it doesnt always have to mean fucking right off and labeling them a horrible person. It can be worked on and moved past and honestly you are typically stronger and better for it.  *end rant* haha"

relationship_advice,exaezk9,t1_ex9i7r5,1566106154.0,"my ex used to always say ""but I never hit you"" like it absolved him from being classified as an abuser.  
He shoved, threw, choked and headbutted me. Bruises and black eyes.  But you know.. he never hit me so its all good apparently.  The mechanisms they have in place to avoid accountability is almost impressive."

Methadone,esp49zm,t1_eso7sju,1562178690.0,You can now. I've been off methadone for a year but my best friend is still at my old clinic. They just switched her to subs without any wd period. Started by giving her 1mg then next day up to 2mg and then next day 3mg and so on till 8mg and then they tapered her off methadone which only took a couple days.  She was on 30 mg methadone.   She felt nothing from the switch or taking away methadone.
AmItheAsshole,eri97ok,t1_erhs9yj,1560892212.0,"Thank you. I want to pull my hair out reading all these comments.  It seems most Redditors have horribly simplistic viewpoints on  cheating. 
OP clearly has not dealt with it. Just shoved it down.  10 YEARS and hes still in the same headspace as when it happened."
