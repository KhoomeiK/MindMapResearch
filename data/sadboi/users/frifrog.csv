BPD,fkap6gr,t3_fgh8zj,1584015835.0,"It's the best summary that I ever read.
But I would like to add somes things, but it's my own experience, and every personn with BPD is different.
Maybe it's already said before, but engmish isn't my mother tongue language.

Some days, I'm waking up and like it's the best day ever. Suddenly life is weirdly amazing and beautiful. All is exciting, like eating a cake or just watch sunlight. My loved ones are everythings. During theses days I'm feeling really beautiful and confident, that's amazing.
And the moment next to, something upset me, and I suddenly hate life, and I have suicidal ideas, I just want to sleep for ever.

Sometimes it's interesting to do not know who I am, because I'm thinking that I can do everything I want and be ""someone else"" (maybe it's not the good words for that I want to say).
But most of the time it's tiring to try theatre, and next day skate, and learn italian language the week next after, it's tiring because I'm totally into it and I quit so quickly. I can't never had a stability in whatever area.

It's tiring to fight this every single days, and never know what the state I will be in.

I think all of theses sentences was already said, bit I really needed to express my feelings."
