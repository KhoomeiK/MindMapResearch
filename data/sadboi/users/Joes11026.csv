antidepressants,fiq3q59,t1_fiq32wf,1582634110.0,I'm on it for GAD the feeling you get from Pregabalin is superior to SSRI. With SSRI you feel drug and it's artificial and the side effects make me depressed which I didn't before Sertraline

antidepressants,fiq1k22,t1_fiq1br5,1582631868.0,No idea in denmark is it becoming more popular. And now a second line treatment after SSRI. It is actually very cheap here due today generics. Maybe the downside is you gotta take it 2-3 times a day and it be difficult for many people fo have good adherence.

I ended up on Vyvase my appetite is down back to were it was before Zoloft, also fatigue gone. Worth to try it. Another option is taking Bupropion with xoloft to counter zoloft side effects. It's kinda like Zoloft makes dopamine down regulated too much and you need a bit of dopamine and Noradrenaline boost to make you feel normal."

zoloft,ff04mk8,t3_eqh6ye,1579465174.0,From what I read adding wellbutrin seems to help with weight gain and sexual dysfunction. Maybe it worth to try it before switching medication. I'm gonna ask my doctor as well for wellbutrin when I get my appointment before I decide to switch. It works really well at controlling my anxiety otherwise i wouldn't pass my driving exam last week. It also have been a nightmare to find meds that works for me. If I were you if wellbutrin didn't work I will ask to be switch to Lyrica.
zoloft,feu750m,t3_eqh6ye,1579383787.0,"30M I am currently on 100mg Sertraline anything lower did not work for anxiety for me, but the side effect is pretty much suck it too forever to cum, lower libido, crazy weight gain 10kg in 1 year while exercising and watching my diet and also cause high prolactin as well near twice of the high range for men.

zoloft,fdgixe0,t3_ekx1oh,1578398696.0,"Your dose is too high, try to lower it, however, if you low it but it didn't work for depression/anxiety. Try to switch to something else. Don't stick to it. I'm switching from Zoloft to Pregabalin soon due to a lot of weight gain (10kg in 1.5 year despite excercise and healthy diet) and sexual dysfunction."

antidepressants,ezyps5f,t3_d2w7qz,1568272459.0,I was at 100mg and now back to 50mg. Side effects was definitely worsen and it didn't go away was the drowsiness and also sex drive was lowered. I also felt a bit numbed at 100mg. For me 50mg is way better and I feel better overall.
Anxiety,ezt40lg,t3_d25tuv,1568120631.0,I used it on top of Zoloft for general anxiety in a high stress situation such as job interview. It is not long lasting only around 4hrs. It only help with physical symptoms of anxiety. The danger it you can faint if blood pressure get too low and you excercise. Because it lower your heart rate. I think it helps with situational anxiety but not general anxiety.

antidepressants,eyd9hk6,t1_eyd8yzr,1567014080.0,For me come down from Adderall is much worst than Vyvase. I live in Europe and most Psychiatrist here only prescribe Vyvase as Elvase here. Try the lowest effect dose dor you. The higher you go the worst the withdrawal becomes.
antidepressants,eyci099,t3_cwk70w,1567002260.0,It is normal to have withdrawal symptoms after every dose of Adderall and heighten anxiety is also normal as a come down withdrawal of Adderall. Try lower dose of Adderall or try Vyvase. It is much longer acting and not blood level of drugs don't jump up and down so much causing bad withdrawal.
zoloft,exfho4t,t3_csbkin,1566240768.0,"This is how anti depressant suppose to work. You suppose to still be able to feel bad or good but the drug helps that the bad is not so bad and easier to get out off. You can take a much higher dose of anti depressant and blunt your emotion you won't feel the low but you won't feel the good either. 

people without depression also feel high and low it would be very abnormal if you only feel good. Like when people with Bipolar is on a manic phase."
