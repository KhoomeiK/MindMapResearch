AskReddit,fij2ml1,t3_f7ykap,1582433234.0,"My sister told me in was too immature (I'm 27, been married almost 10, own a house, 2 cars, and have 2 young children) to understand what life and adulting was really about and that i need to get a handle on my kids. She also said that men come and go and that i shouldn't put my husband before my immediate family. 

This all started because i told her i didn't want to fly with my 3 and 1 year old for over 6 hours because they don't sit well. They need to be moving and sitting on a plane seat with their favorite whatever can only last so long 

And the husband part was said because i told her he can't just ""request a transfer "" to be closer to family. He's in the military. I also told her that i didn't want to separate him from the children because he's going on deployment soon and i wanted them to spend as much time together since this is the first time he'll be away from the kids. 

We're also living paycheck to paycheck so spending a couple grand on a trip isn't in our budget.
