However, my opinion on gore is that it is a sensitive thread in a story. If it is good and makes sense to the scene, then you will hold the reader's attention and it won't feel out of place. But too much detail (or too little) can be distracting and take your reader out of the scene in the book. The idea is to keep your reader engaged in the story; I would take this approach to writing your gory scenes and ask yourself if the reader is constantly interested."

If you're struggling to come up with new ideas, I think its time to step outside of your comfort zone. It isn't about finding a book to help you realize what you're missing but practicing new styles to find your next plot/character/style.

Try some writing prompts you normally would ignore. For example, if you are writing historical fiction, find a sci-fi prompt. Incorporate your characters in this writing exercise and see what they will do. If you end up liking what you wrote, it's a matter of adapting the details to fit your story's setting.

If you're trying to come up with new characters, the trick I use is to find an actor/actress who I think fits the role. Once, I wrote a character with Sigourney Weaver's voice doing the dialogue and the character came to life. She had a story and a purpose that eventually led to character development.

The last thing I'd recommend is literally questioning all of your character decisions. Why would this character travel to this place? What people live there? Where would they go afterwards? What would persuade them to stay? Questioning these decisions not only ties up any plot holes but helps develop the story and the characters. I literally will take a sharpie and large piece of paper and ask question after question until the timeline of events is secure. 

Hope this helps and that you enjoy every bit of writing your story :)"

Baking,ezw4jba,t1_ezw4cw7,1568207697.0,Yeah - there was one moment when I left it for almost a minute because it wasn't setting at all (after maybe 10-15 minutes). I'm wondering if the scrambled came from that point. The other thing I'm considering is the saucepan I used - it isn't a flat bottom but has small indented rings.

3/4 cup fresh lemon juice

1 tablespoon grated lemon zest

3/4 cup sugar

3 eggs

1/2 cup unsalted butter, cubed


In a 2 quart saucepan, combine lemon juice, lemon zest, sugar, eggs, and butter. Cook over medium-low heat until thick enough to hold marks from whisk, and first bubble appears on surface, about 6 minutes."

I used very low to medium low heat while stirring constantly (I was trying to avoid scrambling the eggs). It took maybe 20 minutes or more to cook the curd. It did start bubbling halfway through instead of at the end and didn't set for a long time. 

Any advice for making a better lemon curd in the future is much welcome :) Thank you"
