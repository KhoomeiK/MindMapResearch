Psychonaut,eskaslk,t3_c7vyog,1562057712.0,"This is fascinating, thank you so much for sharing your thoughts and experiences.

I worked for a long time in mental health services and it was  always very clear that the reductive medical model is inadequate in either explaining or treating mental distress.

I was lucky enough in my role (occupational therapist) to be able to teach a few of the things you are talking about through groupwork and the like.

I was also able to bring in a shamanic mental health worker who worked with people who were experiencing extreme distress and it was humbling to see how he could cut through all the noise to communicate with, calm people and offer hope.

It may not surprise you to learn that this shaman had experienced his own issues with 'psychosis' but treated it as a breakthrough and opportunity for growth. As he integrated his learning he found that the hallucinations all went away. He went on to study to become a  social worker, won awards for his work and raise a happy family and remains a friend 15 years later.

I took a break from working in MH but I am now in the process of re registering so that I can go back to enabling people to navigate their way through the maze.

Thank you for reminding me that it will be a worthwhile endeavour.

Good luck on your journey ðŸ˜Š"

There was a forum post that implied the original poster of the tek took the full amount of extract that they made but still... 

Never felt this trepidation before with psilocybin, but aya feels like it will be very different.   At some point I will just have to go for it. Maybe it may be sensible to start with half and see how it goes?
