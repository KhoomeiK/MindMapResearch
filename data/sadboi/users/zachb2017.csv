lonely,fboqlzd,t1_fbo3gx9,1577013321.0,"I can hardcore relate to feeling this way. I’ve been struggling with overcoming this obstacle in life. I’m doing much better in being less sad in my depression, but I still have that constant feeling of missing out on different experiences and opportunities in life... it’s really not something I have control over. The best thing I can try to do is stop comparing myself to others, and work on looking at the attributes I desire in life, and dedicate to making these goals a part of my reality, as long as their attainable."

I struggle to develop that self-confidence as I always feel socially awkward in never knowing what to say in the moment, but I can confirm to myself that I am beautiful in my own body with a bold sense of style. I hope to make positive steps forward someday."

depression,fb6e3q3,t3_ebhs7s,1576548015.0,"I was diagnosed at 20 with MDD. Depression isn’t something to be ashamed of as there are many people out there who struggle. It’s just about finding the right balance in your life, and doing whatever makes you happy or brings you the most joy, whatever that may be. And don’t be limited by what society deems as appropriate. You do you ✨"
