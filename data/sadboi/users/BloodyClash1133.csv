It's just that the timing of that explosion between them had a very bad timing and you were just in the hitting spot.  
The other side: whatevery other people say about things you wear will be forgotten soon (if there will be anything negative at all) and you have every right to express yourself. Many people at that age just don't understand that not everyone can live in the strict society conventions but you can't judge them for that and you shouldn't take it personal. It's just their small world.  
You would hate yourself more if you just live up to their expectations and as soon as you are older you will be admired for your strong will.  
:D it's hard for me to remember how it was to be a teenager (it feels like it's a 1000 years away) but i know it's not always easy but try to think how all this will vanish 5 years from now.

Accepting help in that situation makes him weaker as he already is. At least that is what he may think. Being there is the best a friend can do. It may be hard to stick with him sometimes but it's not intentionally.  
So deep in pain it's super hard to be rational and that's one reason why many of us lose their friends. ""Normal"" people just don't understand that.  
Maybe somtimes you could force him to go out so he won't drown too much into that ocean of self hatred. But when he says he wants no one BUT YOU then this is actually a good sign. It means he trusts you and he is not lost.

Your thoughts actually are the opposite of weird because it shows you are not selfish because you don't wanna hurt anyone else.  
I really really hope you may find a way to get better of at least some hapiness. Wish you all the best"
depression,ey2tci5,t3_cv9x2j,1566747861.0,"6 years - first suicide attempt

10 years - wanted to be pilot to get away from pain :D (i know it's just dumb)

16 years - something with eletronics

24 years - finished studying electronics and became electronics engineer

44 now - completelty broken by depression not able to focus anything most of the time.

So - you see. Taking your time maybe is a better choice than rushing it.

In german we have a word for what you feel: Weltschmerz. It's a pain from longing always to something you can't see and reach. I fully understand you but you are still so young. I'm 100% sure you will make your way. Having your bachelor already opens so many doors for you and if you make a decision you regret later you still can change it. Currently i think you are a bit blocked by the pressure society puts on you by wanting you to find your way as soon as possible."

depression,ey0vfzn,t3_cuwpdu,1566684038.0,":'( so sorry, pal. DAMN FUCKING DRUNK DRIVERS. It sounds maybe stupid to you or just like a phrase but i really believe your friend now is on a much better place (he must be because someone who is a close friend to someone must be good - so it's the better place he went to).

Really hope your environment understands that you slowed down all your responsibilities and progress and that you soo find new powers (going on with your live doesn't mean you ignore what happened. I bet your friend would have wanted you to go on and that you never will forget him )

All the very best wishes from deep in my heart"
