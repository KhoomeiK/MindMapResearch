lexapro,fm7yuh3,t3_ftnkc8,1585839522.0,"IANAD, but I can speak to my experience. 5mg is still a pretty low dose, so it’s possible that it’s a dosage issue.

For me, I did have suicidal thoughts before starting lex. There was a period (maybe ~2-3 months after starting) that my doctor described as a red zone for lexapro users with suicidal thoughts. It was the point where I was still having suicidal thoughts but also feeling a little more motivation in other areas of life. The potential danger is that it may be possible to be more motivated to act on the suicidal thoughts.

Whatever your specific issue is, it does seem like something to discuss with your doctor. If you’re having suicidal thoughts, it’s definitely worth the copay to discuss it and work on getting better.

None of this is easy to deal with, and that’s ok.
Good luck."

r/eatcheapandhealthy has a lot of good advice and recipes. Cooking isn’t as difficult as it may seem at first. It may be pretty necessary during this time.

You could also try some meal boxes like hello fresh or blue apron (but I know they’re a bit inundated right now too). I have some free box offers on blue apron. If you want one, dm me your name and email and I’ll send to you."

Even if I do open up, it seems like it’s taking too long to fix. Not in the sense that it actually is taking a long time, but in the sense that people may not understand that I am struggling now, and I have been struggling for a long time, and I may continue to struggle for a while. So if they ask me about it again next month, I feel dramatic admitting that it’s still going on."

jobs,f5jl2mr,t3_do2adr,1572231603.0,"Our busy season is two consecutive months every year; during that time I do ~60-70 for a 5 day week. This is too much. In order to maintain any sanity, I need to pay extra for services like laundry and cleaning.

Right now, I’m working ~55-60 hours per week, and have been doing so for over a year. At this point I’m seeing detrimental effects physically and mentally. I’m worn out and exhausted. I don’t eat dinner with my family. I’m not sleeping well. I’m stressed and my eyes hurt from looking at a computer screen all day long. I don’t have time to exercise, keep up with friends midweek, or do the things I’d like to do for myself.

In my opinion, either of the above situations are unsustainable for a long period of time, especially for an administrative job with very little thanks. But my department is mismanaged, and management doesn’t care to implement any changes or expand to account for growth. We have had about 40% turnover this year, and they still refuse to take a hint.

Anyway. I’m looking for a new job."
