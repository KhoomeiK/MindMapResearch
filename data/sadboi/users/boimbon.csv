SuicideWatch,fpbld4c,t3_gcb0sp,1588472686.0,"One of the worst things about being an artist is getting criticism. I can relate, I’ve spent months planning and painting a work just to have critics bash it for not being good enough. You put your soul into your work and people shit on it like it’s nothing. That’s one of the things that happens with everyone and everything. You can’t ever make everyone happy. But the criticism you receive doesn’t mean it’s bad.
Your professors and others recognized your talent and believe you’re a good artist, I’m sure others do too. A negative opinion doesn’t have more weight than a positive one. Your work has value. You’ve put your heart in it. Of course it has value. And as a huge horror nerd, I’d love to read it and listen to the soundtrack. Keep creating :)"

The book was too “in your face” and loud with its scares which, in my opinion, is cheap (this isn’t to say that it isn’t a wonderful book, though.) The movie, however, perfectly made me dread every second in the best way and was able to scare me shitless.

The person I was arguing with was a very traditional and religious Christian which was no issue at all. The only problem was that, in his mind, all liberal lgbt people (like myself) were bound to be offended and start screaming at some point, so he was constantly telling me it was ok if I wanted to scream and yell at him and he knew I was offended and mad at him. I just wanted to have a nice debate and am very desensitized to homophobia so nothing he said bothered me. Whenever I brought up a point that contradicted his he’d just tell me that he knew I was hiding how furious I was and to go ahead and start screaming. I ended up giving up"

ArtistLounge,flyu34r,t3_frtnr4,1585609122.0,"To me, good art is what makes you feel. It's different for everyone. For example, I sketched out a basic landscape I wanted to paint, decided I hated it and kept it as a really ""bad"" and empty pencil sketch in my sketchbook. However, when my friend and her bf came over for dinner and were looking through my sketchbook, he saw the sketch and started crying. He said it looked just like the landscape from when he was in basic and felt really nostalgic all of the sudden. To me, that sketch was trash, to him it resembled something important to him.

My mom treasures all the crap sketches of anime girls I made in middle school even though I think it's cringy because she loves things that remind her of how much I've grown. My friend bought a sketch of a bluebird from her friend who thought she did a terrible job because my friend's grandma loved bluebirds and it made her think of her grandmother. I have framed a sketch of my favorite singer in my room I made even though others say it's mediocre because I have great memories attached to his music. It varies from person to person. That's why you'll lose on art competition to some crap from your best work and win a completely different competition with the same piece. 

It can be any emotion. Fear when you look at a panel from Junji Ito's manga, confusion when you look at Salvador Dali's landscapes, disgust when you see some crap hentai on Deviantart. If it made you feel it's done what I believe is the true goal of art: leave a mark on the onlooker, whether that be haunt them or remind/show them of something wonderful."
ArtistLounge,flystih,t3_frzjpv,1585608398.0,"When I need motivation, I look at art on Pinterest and try to draw inspiration from it. Try making a board on there of all your favorite artwork if you haven't already and sketch out all the ideas you think of from there!

Also, I bring my sketchbook with me almost everywhere I go so I can quickly sketch something I thought was cool so I can use it for inspiration later. Having a ton of ideas you've collected and noted throughout the day is a great motivator. Since we can't leave our homes rn due to the virus, maybe sketch cool things you see in videos you watch or around your house/apartment!"
