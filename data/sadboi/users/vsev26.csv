ucla,fo7ryoj,t3_g5ymvx,1587583520.0,"same, im in my first year and im already having second thoughts about everything. i still love the medical field, but i just dont think its for me, I know im capable of actually going through with it and being successful but I dont think I want to spend all of these years in school and working those long hours. I want to have a family and be able to spend time with my family in the future, and I've been looking at teaching. since I like the medical field so much I would probably want to be an anatomy teacher or a psychology teacher, but i know my family would be disappointed in me. everyone's always saying that its your life so you should do what you want but my biggest trigger in life is disappointing me parents. I dont know how I would be able to live with myself if told them I dont want to be a doctor anymore. But yeah ive had these exact same thoughts as you. As of now, ive decided to stick to pre-med because of my fear of disappointment, and because I truly think I can do it. i really dont know whats gonna end up happening though :/"
