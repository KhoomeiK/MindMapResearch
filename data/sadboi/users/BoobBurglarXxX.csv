Interesting fact:
She used to do gymnastics when she was a kid and hasn't lost flexibility since then. This activity was a compromise with her parents who were overly caring and protective. As soon as Kayla realized that she couldn't get away with simple school competitions, and they were trying to make her an Olympic champion, she rebelled.
The moment she finished school, she ran away from home, stopped being a goody-two-shoes, and worked towards becoming her own person. A series of not very good decisions led her into a very bad situation Alek eventually rescued her from."
