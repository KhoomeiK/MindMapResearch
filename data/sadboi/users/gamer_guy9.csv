indianpeoplequora,fcmarim,t3_ehwmqr,1577768948.0,"LOL. My experience on internet says that these two are nothing but just the might keyboard warriors from the Galaxy of Jobless Moronies. 


 I happen to know someone who owns and runs 5 successful companies and is a multi-millionaire. He has a massive presence on internet as well. I have never seen him bashing anybody on his  social media platforms or bragging about his business earnings. The way he deals with the haters is something to learn.

So whatever our convex lens seller and tatti interviewer guy earn together in a year, the guy I'm talking about earns in a few weeks probably. 

The thing is everyone has got a point. Is it really necessary to show off your earnings or job to prove your point..? 

These both sound like a bunch of jealous and quarrelsome fellows that only daydream. Anything that comes in between their dreams get keyboarded.

About the looks part, well again we are in the same boat. However, I have learnt to accept and live with it. It may vary from person to person. 

I will only wish you best. I can relate to your issue, and it is painful. This world expects a pretty face more than a pretty heart."
depression,f96wmmc,t3_e3sl6j,1575153777.0,"I confirmed this years ago right from the high school days where no one wanted to be my friend. Though I used to be a jovial guy, I started understanding how this world works. Looks, money matter a lot, in fact they are the only thing that matters. I gradually turned in to a loner/introvert who started to become afraid of everyone.

Looks is zero in my case and I am from a middle class family, however, these days I am making a decent amount of money from my freelancing gigs. However, back in the college I was a pauper. 

Girls only cared about guys with looks and money. So, I stood nowhere. 

Then after entering Masters I did liked a cute girl, but came to know she had a good looking boyfriend. Heck I could not even become her friend.

Spending those three years oh boy.. it was difficult to face her every day. One day it was over as University life ended. I do miss her sometimes. Her voice was baby girl like, so cute, I haven't heard that voice in 4 years. She never added me on any social media.i also did not unnecessarily attracted her attention by sending irritating messages. Love cannot be forced or imposed right.?

I don't look good, and I haven't achieved anything as such in life as of now in 28 years. Though I am trying hard to make more money and hopefully I'm doing a lot of solo traveling which comforts my mind.

Even though I have no one who cares about my existence, I do, I love myself and try to live my life as much as possible. It's difficult but I am hanging on.

Arranged marriage is out of question. As per society a freelancer is as good as jobless even though I make good amount of money. So, marriage is out of question.

No girl in a wild miraculous chance is going to love the caring, gentle, humble person like me. First thing I am ugly looking. 


Trust me, I Do Not know 

* how does it feel to go on a date
* How does it feel to hold a girl's hand
* I don't know the feeling of talking those dreamy talks with your special girl
* I don't know what it feels like to be in love.

But I am hopeful one day in this living life I will experience it. I DESERVE TO BE LOVED. ðŸ˜žðŸ˜¥

But I believe it's the society which is to be blamed. I'm not perfect I agree but atleast give me a chance. Alas, that will never happen.

No one loves me. No one cares. It's difficult but I won't give up. 

If you ask what my plan is, then I will say that if at all by some wonder, any girl who comes to my life I will treat her the best and shower all that feelings which I always wanted to share.

I'm such a bad loner. I often talk with my own self. Cry my heart out. I have so much feelings to share but such is fate, the nicest of the hearts end up dying a loner.

I'm hopeful though I'm afraid, no one loves me or will ever do. I hope someone will be there to hold my hands. 

Every time I feel lonely at night, I hug my pillow and practice how I would hug my special one, who apparently doesn't exist. 

Pray for me. I deserve to be loved. We all deserve to be loved. It hurts at one point.

I'm hopeful that things may change for all of us. Where there is life, there is hope."
