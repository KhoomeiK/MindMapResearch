I’m also voting green because ‘just 5 percent of the national vote for the Green Party can be a true game-changer for American politics. It will qualify the Green Party for recognition as an official national party, and for federal funding in the presidential race proportional to the amount of votes received — at least $8 million to $10 million. It would also secure ballot access in a number of states that automatically grant ballot status if the presidential candidate receives anywhere from 1 percent to 5 percent of the vote (varying by state). It means the party can leap over the undemocratic barriers to ballot access for independent parties in many states, and help us lay the groundwork for a truly competitive challenge to the two-party system and the corporate rule it perpetuates.’

The man who made a host of videotaped promises in exchange for the Working Families Party’s endorsement only to turn around and break them all.
