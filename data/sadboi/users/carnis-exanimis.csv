BPD,fpjkqzb,t3_gdadnp,1588672202.0,"Yes, it happens to me all the time. To the point I don't want to watch TV shows and such because my personality will fuck up and I'll pick up a mask based on some character. I have enough personality issues..."
dpdr,fod4yvv,t3_g4n0ku,1587679940.0,"My dpdr started in middle school, when I started developing avpd and anxiety, on top of existential crises all the time. Wasn't under any influence until the end of high school."
BPD,fo9pvrh,t1_fo9bo0g,1587627055.0,Thank you... Your motivation makes sense. I never looked at it this way - to live and help others like me. But it makes sense. Thank you. ♥

Hyphens here being the... Longer notes? Or something.
Hope it helps."
BPD,fnd33yw,t3_g0puu9,1586856848.0,"I'm not sure if it's really a bpd thing, neurotypicals seem to have the same or similar thing too. But yeah, I can relate for sure as a borderline."
depression,fhs0kmw,t1_fhs0i90,1581847780.0,Hopefully some doctor I'll see asap will help me decrease the dose. I won't survive a day or two if this goes on. Maybe there's something ekser to help me.
BPD,fhepvo4,t1_fheotr0,1581527465.0,"Hm, I see... Maybe it's not it fucking me up then, who knows..."
BPD,fhegi10,t1_fheg5qr,1581521903.0,"I'm only seeing my psych in April so I'm wrecked in this case. Someone suggested to me asking a pharmacist about decreasing the dose, but I don't think the pharmacists here know shit or care enough. I could go down on it myself, try decreasing it to 125 mg and go down slowly, yknow. But I'd rather have it be controlled by a psych.

I feel like Zoloft never gave me much, so I'm not sure really. I felt like... Nothing was changed? I have no idea man. Lamotrigine does shit, Zoloft doesn't seem to do anything but give me dreams literally every night. And now this hellish anxiety and panic."
BPD,fgi3vhv,t1_fgi3mru,1580804283.0,"Not feeling welcome, mind you. How are they not real?"
BPD,fg4wgob,t1_fg4vc9e,1580512632.0,Nothing is gonna be fine. She said me and my bpd broke her now. For the first time.
BPD,fg3ypya,t3_ewm89v,1580492507.0,"yeah. been there. when i was more psychotic and unstable, i even believed i was sent here by some higher powers. but for years, ive been believing this is all a simulation. it makes me panic, though, so i try to forget about it. its not like i can find out whether its true or not, anyways..."
BPD,ffy7r90,t1_ffy6zip,1580340209.0,"Thank you, this calmed me down a bit. I think I'll be able to go to sleep now, haha. Thanks again."
BPD,ffy6255,t1_ffy5qik,1580339248.0,"The problem with this musician was how his life came out and that I look up to this even though I realize that it's wrong, haha. Long story short he was an addict, fucked up his medicine once and ended up paralyzed, committed suicide several years later. I don't know why do I idolize him but I do. My mind wants me to do the same as he did.

But you're right, I still have this grip on reality. I didn't have that the last time I was obsessing. I don't think I'd be alive if I somehow didn't stop myself back then."
BPD,ffy4ek8,t1_ffy3etg,1580338332.0,I suppose it doesn't always end up this hardcore. Dunno.
BPD,ffxu1ip,t1_ffxnkfo,1580332419.0,"Yeah, I... totally didn't just stop reading some huge article about the guy and his death. It's stupid, I know I shouldn't, I know I'll get triggered, but here I am, goddamn doing it. I find myself repeating the exact same behaviors I did the last time I was obsessing over someone. This shit sucks.
I'll need to somehow force myself to stop. Stop listening to his music first, I guess... Although now it helps me get through every day basically."
BPD,ffxmfq9,t3_evs7o2,1580328101.0,"I was thinking maybe it's some bad case of seeing in black n white, making the person look perfect and ideal. I'm not sure."

depression,ffuzorq,t3_evbm74,1580252435.0,"Take a screenshot or otherwise save this post to yourself somehow. Look at it when you feel bad, repeat these words to yourself. Feeling good exists - feeling bad is temporary, and this is your proof. I'm proud of you. ♥"
BPD,ffrqswk,t1_ffr82fv,1580163763.0,"Yes, exactly. Sad to admit, but I don't think I'd be here now if I wasn't on lamotrigine."
depression,ffrpnew,t3_eus2jm,1580163034.0,I understand that and I feel the same right now... It's so painful.
BPD,ffriy4m,t3_euj9ey,1580158948.0,Absolutely... It makes it difficult to watch anything. I identify with everyone I see there.

depression,fejcd67,t1_fejcalb,1579166949.0,Just finished presenting in front of whole group and prof. Now this day shouldn't be stressful anymore. Maybe I'll feel fine

depression,fej43t1,t1_feh10gb,1579156158.0,"Now when I left my house to go to the bus stop to get to uni, I suddenly had a weird flash like... I should go home. Now. I shouldn't be among all these people. I'm scared. But I didn't give in... Today's classes are too important to skip under any circumstances"
