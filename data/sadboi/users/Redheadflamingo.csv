Coronavirus,fligl5r,t1_fli82lk,1585182073.0,"The amazing fucking irony of all this is that if I get COVID 19, as a lupus patient, I have a pretty good chance of my immune system going into overdrive and causing me a massive flare. Take away my Plaquenil and I probably won’t die from the virus but I could have life-changing and life-limiting complications from the flare that results. Back in the 80s my mother with lupus ended up in a coma with a DNR after contracting the flu. She was lucky to survive with only the amputation of one leg due to vasculitis.
Stop being so cavalier about a drug that people are using daily to stay alive and healthy."
Coronavirus,flie6qv,t1_fli6ksn,1585180653.0,"Lupus has a higher mortality rate than COVID 19, about 10-15 percent. And since it predominantly affects younger women (15 - 45), it has a significant affect on average lifespan. COVID 19 only reaches that level of mortality after the age of 70."
ontario,flf4iu6,t1_flf3bph,1585097881.0,"My insurance will not give me a four month supply. You are very lucky if yours does. I see my rheumy every 4-5 months so I only get repeats for that long. I couldn’t get a 4 month supply at once even if I was paying cash.

Opening up the supply chain, what does this mean to you? This drug has been available for ages and is prescribed all around the world. Drug companies cannot be expected to increase production of a single drug by what, 100x, 1000x, 10,000x just on the hopes that their drug will be a cure and therefore in demand."
ontario,flf2j84,t1_flf0nza,1585096613.0,You can’t just snap your fingers and change the supply chain overnight: have you tried to buy toilet paper lately? I think it should be used in a legitimate research setting with consideration being given to the available supply before everyone and their dog runs to their family doc for a script.
ontario,flezvdm,t1_flenyon,1585094949.0,"The problem with trying it is that there are a lot of patients with a legitimate need for this prescription medication and people touting this as the cure are making it impossible to get a hold of. I have 2 serious autoimmune diseases and have taken this drug for 20+ years. When I asked for an extra 2 weeks of my Plaquenil prescription (in order to limit my need to leave my house for the foreseeable future) from my pharmacist and she told me that it is out of stock everywhere.
How is that not a problem?"
Anxiety,eyw3hwl,t3_cz583t,1567519943.0,I don’t typically have too much trouble with anxiety but I have stuff going with my kid that pushing me over the edge today. Your little tattoo has given me something very helpful to visualize while trying to control my thoughts. Thanks for sharing!
