bestoflegaladvice,fp9q3el,t3_gc6gkj,1588432156.0,I bought a car from a dealership and they forgot to put oil. It was my first car so I didn't know a lot about cars but my oil light kept coming on. I called them and tried to schedule an oil change and they told me I didn't need it. They said to bring it in and they'd find out why my car was giving me the wrong lights. My car broke down on New Years Eve before I could make it in. I had it for 2 months at that time. I had to pay to tow it there and had to leave bad reviews before they helped me out. I ended up getting a new engine and other components but it took 3 weeks to have the engine shipped from Texas. I feel for the OP.
