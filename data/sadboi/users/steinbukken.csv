mentalhealth,fdsv2ce,t1_fdsus7z,1578708315.0,I definitely would. But nothing has been like ACTUALLY alarming. You know? Basically every symptom had like a rhyme or reason for somethin. But of course my mind is like ‚ÄúDEATH AND CANCER‚Äù
mentalhealth,fdsrqye,t1_fdsqj9r,1578707094.0,"It wasnt really anything like that, it was more so a leave without closure. She basically couldnt take my insurance anymore and i had to stop seeing her and it was somewhat abrupt. She had seen me through a dark time in my life and she meant alot to me. But it wasnt her fault and i took it hard. 
And im not exactly sure. But i guess the reason i dont go to a doctor is because none of these symptoms that come and go, stay longer than a day, they change day to day, dependent on what im worried about that day. Whether it be, cancer, or kidney issues, or brain tumor or whatever. My health anxiety stems from my mother who has been in and out of the hospital for as long as i can remember. So i avoid hospitals/doctors as much as i can."
mentalhealth,fdsn5cy,t1_fdslvxy,1578705394.0,"Wow i really appreciate all of what youve said. And youre very right. Its all just a clusterfuck in honesty. 
I would like to see a therapist but.. i kinda had a therapist breakup that really left me hurt and i havent wanted to see another one bc i enjoyed my last one so much. Im trying to work through my traumas bc they just go back so so so so far. And im slowly having epiphanies and making sense of everything which is helping. But it just was exacerbated recently because of everything. Like literally came home from seeing my sister that i havent seen in 2 years, across the country, to come home and feel semi alone again to that news all within a few days and i was sad at first then the sadness went away and i was like ‚Äúwow i feel good‚Äù (mentally) and then the physical symptoms happened and have just. Wiped my slate absolutely clean. If i can just accept the fact that its all mental i can work through it but i dont wanna face a doctor in the case somethinf might actually be wrong."

mentalhealth,fdsgtym,t1_fdsgb4v,1578702463.0,"Ive had health anxiety for as long as i can remember. My anxiety comes and goes with life. It comes from some childhood trauma i had (but i downplay it bc to me its not as bad as other peoples trauma. But i suppose by definition it could be trauma) its really taken me down a rabbit hole in the past as well as OCD tendencies (constantly washing my hands, intrusive thoughts, i had anorexia (afraid to eat bc i didnt wanna vomit), bulimia (my anxiety would cause me to puke bc i physically couldnt handle how my body reacted), PTSD (from some emotional relationship abuse i went through at a key age for development in relationships). As well as depression.
