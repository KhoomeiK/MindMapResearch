Libertarian,fpwqjic,t1_fpwbp6o,1588968135.0,Childcare has educational value as well. Centers have lesson plans and school schedules. It’s so much more than the babysitting stereotype that it is portrayed

Libertarian,fpw8ird,t1_fpw88uh,1588959078.0,This is true. I used to work with a great nonprofit that helped unplanned mothers with parenting classes and work training and introduced them to support groups and group play dates. They could also work in the facility to earn baby supplies. It was a great program and I miss working with them

Libertarian,fpw75p3,t3_gfwi4t,1588958423.0,"As an educator I love ALL your points and agree with them, however, how do we ensure that educators are paid a livable wage? I believe severely cutting the powers of the department of education and putting that funding towards teachers and in the school itself will be a much better use of those billions of dollars. This can be easily done by using the voucher system"

Libertarian,fpw6l64,t1_fpw5dbi,1588958144.0,We use a voucher system. Every child in the state gets an established amount to pay for tuition every year. The parents then make the choice to put their children in the right school for their child. If the school is inadequate parents will go to other schools so that good schools get more students and tuition and bad schools close. It’s a free market scenario to build competition and still ensure every child is on a level playing field
Libertarian,fpw65wr,t1_fpw5c8h,1588957936.0,"I agree that those people should be left to fail, but we must understand that uneducated and impoverished families are made earlier with more children. Those children are abandoned by society and grow to also be uneducated and impoverished, continuing the cycle. They then do not know how to properly support themselves and become easy victims to predatory politicians. This is why public school in general is dangerous. As of now the government controls what its students will learn, building a false narrative of history and literature and building a false trust in an abusive government"
Libertarian,fpw5obs,t1_fpw57mx,1588957694.0,"Thank you for such a well written point. You’re right that childcare falls on women much more than men, andpwrhaps that is why, untill middle or high school, it is mostly women that are teachers and therefore paid so much less perhaps because we are women or perhaps because the labor is expected of us for free."

Libertarian,fpw2uy7,t1_fpw2iba,1588956297.0,"Childcare is much more privatized, and I think the education is better and there is much more variety into different focuses of education. This is how public schools should be (voucher program would solve that.) but childcare teachers especially, although all teachers are paid so poorly. Childcare workers are paid poverty level. And public schools are right on the line. Private schools are for the most part paid less than public"
