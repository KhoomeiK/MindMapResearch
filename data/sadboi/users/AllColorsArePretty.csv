A good thing to do in my opinion is to first do something that distracts you. Like things you enjoy doing whether it’s gaming, drawing, movies, etc. Doing what makes you feel good is always a good first step. This distraction will help you cool off and start reaching more of a normal state. 

Another thing that you could do to is to keep track of when you are going through this cycle and what stage you are in.

Just remember that nothing is going to happen immediately and that it won’t be easy. 

Never feel bad for yourself. You are on your own journey here. Be strong!

You can PM me if you ever need future help or want to follow up!"

If we don’t look at you in the eyes often it is due to us having a hard time with it due to autism. We also get very stuck into the details of things. Being vague is not easy for us.
