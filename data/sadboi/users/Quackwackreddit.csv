SuicideWatch,eot1s5g,t3_bsuw2x,1558833522.0,"“Suicide is not chosen; it happens
when pain exceeds 
resources for coping with pain.”

That's all it's about. You are not a bad person, or crazy, or weak, or flawed, because you feel suicidal. It doesn't even always mean that you really want to die - it only means that you have more pain than you can cope with right now. If I start piling weights on your shoulders, you will eventually collapse if I add enough weights... no matter how much you want to remain standing. Willpower has nothing to do with it. Of course you would cheer yourself up, if you could."
