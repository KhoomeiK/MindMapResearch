newzealand,fofcux2,t1_fofaff1,1587732934.0,"You're being deliberately obtuse so you can claim my points are wrong.

Cultural opinions are not pop culture and you know this. They weren't voting on pop culture, correct. Pop culture is media. Culture informs pop culture as well as legislation. The reason that was even brought up initially is that when pressed for examples of pop culture depictions you first provided me with academic studies, you introduced the argument about culture

Depicting the death of a sex worker as acceptable is absurd, hence why the joke is an absurdity. Why is that hard to recognise? I should have maybe said picky rather than touchy or perhaps just left it at ""broad generalisation""

When we talk about sex offenders I'm assuming you're talking the violent kind. I should have clarified.

It absolutely does matter why the help is given, you're arguing that prostitutes are on the same societal level as drug addicts!

>No. We find that sort of thing disgusting because we've been taught its disgusting. Are you suggesting we can intuit mental illness? Not really sure where you're going with that curly one.

Mental illness is basically a brain working in a 'sick' way, hence someone that commits a sex offense is breaking the social construct in a negative way because we've all agreed that rape is wrong. In that sense yes you can intuit it. You're splitting hairs here for literally no reason since it's irrelevant why we think the actions are wrong

>This statement is contradictory. You say humour works on the relatable and yet go on to say no one would find a joke about sex offenders being scum funny because people relate to it... Also, black comedy works differently than standard humour even though I fully believe the OP didn't intend his comment to be black comedy.

It isn't funny because it's not relatable or absurd. The hooker joke is funny because its not relatable but it is absurd. Please don't be too touchy about the generalisation here because comedy is so broad a subject you kind of need to make broad strokes like this for the sake of a coherent argument

>No. Society didn't vote to repeal prostitution laws and in fact it very nearly failed (60/59)

You're right, parliament voted - you know, the elected representatives of society. The near failure I think is more of a statement about caution towards action by MPs trying not to upset their constituents. If it was a clear case of ""prostitutes are garbage"" the vote wouldn't have been close at all

Pop culture is reflective of general culture as one draws from the other. I'm not suggesting that legislative decisions are based on popular culture. Not sure how the US comes into consideration here? Very different legal system and government to ours"
newzealand,fof332a,t1_fof2dhl,1587724262.0,"You're correct but culture informs legislature whether you agree with that statement or not is irrelevant since parliament is representative. The fact that prostitutes were given legal protection shows that they aren't regarded as garbage by society and the fact that they aren't makes the black comedy thing work. Humour works on the relatable or the absurd. If you were to make a similar statement about sex offenders no one would find it funny because you're right we regard them as subhuman. Hence the fact that we as a society try and change the way they are, it's not about compassion it's about protecting the rest of society. You can recognise mental illness and still not empathise with a person, in fact the very idea that we immediately see that sort of behaviour as disgusting and morally reprehensible informs the notion that there is something mentally wrong about these people.

Also can't really tell from the vid if you are doing it already or not but you need to bend towards the inside of the neck, so the bass strings you'll be using a pulling motion and the treble strings you'll be using a pushing motion.

Sex offenders receiving help isn't the same thing at all, because what you're talking about is that they're known to be mentally ill so our public initiatives are about helping them not to reoffend. They're treated with open hostility and that's consistent with our attitude that they need rehabilitation. If we thought the same things about prostitutes they wouldn't have their status legally protected and regulations around their workplace health and safety, as a society we'd be focused on getting them into ""normal"" jobs.

Clearly you know your shit though a quick ctrl-f in these articles provided me with no results for any of those words. For the links I could actually view anyway

Anyhow I think it's self evident that through the fact that prostitution is legal in brothels in New Zealand that we as a society recognise the fact that sex workers are in need of some form of security in their line of work, and personally I don't think you do that for occupations that you consider as subhuman. Like we aren't out there trying to provide protections for meth dealers for instance.

newzealand,foejq6n,t1_foeifkq,1587705580.0,"Understanding that something is in fact a joke doesn't mean that you don't treat the subject matter as being serious. The comment you quoted was referencing the idea that black humour only applies when it challenges hardly discussed topics.

Let me break it down in a way that allows me to show why I think you're wrong and using big words to rationalise your distaste for it.

Sex workers are at a higher risk of being treated in a dehumanising fashion. To discuss this in a manner where we are throwing statistics and justifications around is an ineffective way of challenging preconceived notions as it continues to stay in the area of clinical detachment. Useful for when discussing scientific ideas but in terms of humanity not so much.

 Using a throwaway joke ""dead hookers in the avon"" that highlights the apparent cheapness of life when it pertains to sex work produces a visceral gut reaction  (like the one you just had), and brings forth feelings of disgust as well as discomfort. It takes the well known fact that human life is precious and throws that away with a dismissive attitude which highlights the hypocrisy of people with that attitude. Add to that the events that happened in Christchurch and you get context for the joke as well.

 If you think that people in general commonly believe that a prostitute's life is worthless then I can understand your reaction but I really don't think that's the case. I think you got offended thinking the joke was meant as a way of saying that sex workers are not worthy of empathy and are now trying to seem intelligent while fundamentally misunderstanding the premise"
