MomForAMinute,fr5f9xo,t1_fr3y9r0,1589907605.0,"your story really touched me, i just had to respond! i'm glad i could impact your life as you have mine. you truly radiate such warmth.

you've got a big brain and a big heart to match. the world needs more people like you. it's lovely that you want to help everyone, but remember to help yourself too. light a few candles (my favourite scent is fresh laundry!) and watch your favourite movie. i've loved listening to you sing, maybe you could calm your nerves with some lyric writing? :)

i'm sorry you feel alone. you've so much love to give but people just don't have enough hands to hold it all. it's a busy time, and it's hard to focus on friendships. i understand all too well how isolation amplifies already noticeable loneliness. just know, that i am thinking of you daily. i see little things that remind me of you; like fluffy clouds surfing on a bright sky, or the green clovers that pepper the lawn - i think that's your colour!! xx

i would like to stay optimistic and say you just feel things a lot harder, and express your affection more straight-forward, so it would seem your friends aren't reciprocating that love for you. i'm personally not as in-contact with my friends as i'd like to be, but that doesn't mean i love them any less. you're never alone. you don't have to go through this alone. apologies, i don't know where you're at, but once restrictions ease up you should (SAFELY!!!!!) have a small get together with them! remember to social distance, though. wash your hands and all that. ‚ù§Ô∏è

whatever name you had before does not matter to me. you have been, and always will be, august; a remarkable young man that anyone would be lucky to have in their lives. üíñüíñüíñ"

(hint: the answer is no, there is nothing you can't do). i bet you could even make pigs fly!!

i understand how that imposter syndrome can feel. i think you're just such a bright kid, with the world at your fingertips. even if you don't think your rewards were deserved or matter, *i* do. i wish i had better advice on how to find more challenging and stimulating projects. if you could find the time, maybe try tutoring as a side hustle? since you don't find your own knowledge impressive, teaching someone what you know and helping them bump up a grade or two feels very satisfying. just a suggestion, though! :)

you are my son. my intelligent, handsome, ambitious, and inspiring son. no matter who you choose to be, no matter what path you go down, that will remain the same. you don't have to earn my love, as that is unconditional. i am so sorry your real mom has made you think you have to work for it. that will never be the case, and i appreciate you the way you are.

please, don't do things for her, do them for you. she's made it clear that she is selfish and blind to what's in front of her. i think once you start living for yourself, you will find more happiness in the things you do. your life is your own, and her approval (should she give it) will not change that. not only is it unobtainable, but also unimportant. you don't have to chase the carrot.

you feel you won't be good enough for yourself, because you've spent so long trying to prove your worth to someone who doesn't want to see it. like trying to speak to a brick wall. i see how hard you're trying, and i hate that she's made you think your achievements are worthless, because they're not.

your works mean the world to me. not because of the results (but they are just as impressive), but your effort. your determination pays off, your best is always good enough.

i love you always and forever

\- mom.

ps: i've just listened to your [cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjAnJUtTrU8)! you can sing, and play the guitar too? the list of reasons i admire you keeps growing. your voice is beautiful and so smooth. i could listen to you for hours!! i can't wipe this grin off my face. :) keep up the amazing work. i'll be forever cheering you on, august, my wonderful son. <3"

i won't lie, it's going to be really really fucking difficult. life will be on autopilot for longer than i wish it would. do what you must to make things easier. unfriend and untag, distract yourself with friends and hobbies, and reflect when you feel more at ease.

explainlikeimfive,fmzbffh,t3_fxznqf,1586514008.0,"an itch can have a lot of causes. could be dead or dry skin buildup, could be a bug bite, could be a hair strand you mistake for a spider, could be a skin condition like eczema. there are also ""phantom itches"" where the place you feel the need to scratch may not be where an itch really is. 

that's all well and good, but *why* do we actually itch and scratch?

it was actually thought for a while that an itch was just a dialed down feeling of pain, but in reality the feeling of itching has a different circuitry in our nervous system to the pain nerves we believed they were, including its own cells, reactions, and chemicals! this explains why people have different pain thresholds, yet always have the same response to itching.

so, it starts with a signal sent up your spinal cord to your brain by, let's call them ""itch nerves."" these itch nerves pick up on a certain feeling against your skin, and tell your brain ""hey, there's something here!!"" your brain responds to that by creating an itch, as a way of alerting your hands to go deal with it. 

when you scratch an itch, the signals the itch nerves were giving to your brain are stopped and the pain nerves begin sending signals instead. it's basically like covering someone's mouth so they stop speaking - your scratching is causing the pain nerves to shut the itch nerves up. ever wondered why slapping or pinching an itch also gave you a sense of relief? the pain nerves are accomplishing the same task! 

**fun fact!** itching, like yawning, is unexplainably contagious!! i bet just reading the word ""itch"" throughout this comment has made you scratch yourself a few times."

>I 22F have been with my partner 24M for 4 years now, i have never known him to do anything like this, but i noticed he started acting a little strange around a month maybe a month and a half ago.  
>  
>He started putting fruit on the floor in the garden and i thought it was a bit weird but he said he was feeding the mice family that have nested i'm our shed so i thought it was sweet and helped him do so.  
>  
>Anyways he started being really nice to me around 2 weeks ago and was making me food, baking me cakes and stuff (which he never usually cooks ever so i was so happy he found a hobby)  
>  
>I did notice sometimes i felt sick and dizzy after eating and i just put it down to lack of sleep/hormones.  
>  
>Anyways a friend of my partners came into my work today (i work in a cafe) and said he needed to speak to me when i was free (i was free as there wasn't any customers at this time) he told me that my partner has been collecting slugs from the garden on fruit he has been putting out there and putting them in my food, blending them up, he even sent this friend of his pictures of a bag of slugs he had collected and the picture of blended slugs.  
>  
>I feel Really sick to my stomach, i don't understand why he would do this, this is so out of character of him, i asked him why he was doing it and he accused me of snooping through his messages (which i would never do) and got so angry at me for 'not being able to take a joke'  
>  
>I feel disgusting, i love him to pieces but i just don't understand his way of thinking just now.  
>  
>Am i overreacting? I don't know what to do i feel Lost

OverwatchUniversity,fmricnf,t3_fwyou0,1586324098.0,"i'm not gonna offer any gameplay advice because i'm a gold support player also attempting to climb, but just some general tips about playing overwatch comp. \^\^

1. you're allowed to take breaks. playing the same game all the time, especially when you feel you should be improving and you're not, will eventually just wear you down. 
2. main tank is simultaneously the most crucial role and the hardest to carry with. you become very dependant on your dps and supports. if you aren't getting that backup, no amount of space you create goes to anything. while you're probably not GM, it's safe to say high bronze-high plat is the biggest mixed bag of players. you may very well be lower than you should be, but don't let this mindset affect the way you play! there's always something to improve. your first thoughts shouldn't be ""it's my teams fault"" or ""it's because i'm in silver and no one else can play at my level.""
3. third, find a duo or group you can queue with. if comms are the issue, ""stay as group"" with some people you have good comms with. or use the find a group option. i found my group of friends just by having a good game with them and opting to stay!
4. finally, quit while you're ahead. to stop long loss streaks you have to call it off early. 3-4 losses in a row? give comp a rest for a while. it sucks to end on a low note but the longer your loss streak the higher amount of SR you lose.

good luck my dude!"
