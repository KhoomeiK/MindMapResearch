Now I am trying to focus on lighter subjects, distractions and whatnot, if you wanna talk, I am here, I can distract you if that can help !"

algeria,foxjswr,t1_fovj0yz,1588146224.0,"I've been diagnosed with depression about 8 years ago, doctors didn't help and the only thing that gave me some will was a friend that was always there, for that I tried my best.
Now I'm not one to run away from my problems or bad thoughts, actually that's kind of the issue my mind never really switches off, drugs never even once crossed my mind until this month where the mental break down was so severe, I swear to god I never experienced anything like that, the physical pain that came with it was unmatched I was physically ill, that was the first time ever I actually begged a friend to get me something, anything to just calm and sedate me. With the lockdown that was not possible and I just rely on sleep meds ( I couldn't sleep for a whole week) and NGL the fact that drugs seem appealing for me at this point makes me disgusted with myself, I am aware that I'll fall into a strong addiction, that will only make my problems worse."
