Milk can be kept at room temp too (comes out of cows warm), but not for as long.

I‚Äôm sure if you leave it out for months it‚Äôll probably go bad eventually but if you use butter regularly it‚Äôs totally fine and safe to keep out of the fridge. 

[You can get a nice butter keeper](https://images.app.goo.gl/XppQHPrfKCqVz8N29) or just an old fashioned butter dish. 

You also used to be able to keep eggs out on the counter as well (remember they come out warm from inside chickens) but once you put them in the fridge it‚Äôs not good to keep them at room temp anymore.

COVID-19 can live up to 2 days on hard surfaces.

It can linger in the air up to 2-3 hours. 

There‚Äôs an article on the front page that states Wigan‚Äôs lockdown delayed the spread of the virus by 80%. 


I‚Äôm curious as to why you think that shutting down large gatherings won‚Äôt mitigate the spread of a pandemic? Do you have any science to back that up?

People need to stop thinking as selfish individuals and start thinking as a community. Everyone needs to do their best to make sure this doesn‚Äôt become a bigger deal than it already is. I‚Äôm especially appalled by the selfish attitude I‚Äôve seen of people who are low risk for death engaging in risky behaviors (going to concerts, traveling, etc) just because they probably won‚Äôt die. Do they not see that they become carriers for the disease? Do they not understand that they‚Äôre putting immense strain on our healthcare systems and are actively making it harder to contain this? Do they not care that they can and will spread the disease to higher risk populations like the immunocompromised and the elderly? ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre healthy you‚Äôll live‚Äù, sure, but YOU WILL SPREAD THE DISEASE TO VULNERABLE MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY. What the hell is wrong with you?

This is turning into a rant but this is one reason why I have a big problem with capitalist, individualist societies. We are not thinking as a unit. We are not doing all we can to make sure we survive and thrive as a community. We have lost all of our empathy and our ability to work for the good of the group. We refuse to sacrifice comforts and luxuries to make sure the pack thrives.

You are spreading wrong and dangerous information about COVID-19 just because you want to be a douchey contrarian and feel smarter than everyone else. You could not be more wrong. This is not a drill."
