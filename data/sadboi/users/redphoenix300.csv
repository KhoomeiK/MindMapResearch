Be careful what you wish for because if you don't want advice, you'd get few responses and feel like you arent being heard. Advice also shows that people care. If you don't have any intention of getting better and working at ending your depression, then your wasting your time. Instead of wallowing in self pity, try to take advice. Take this from someone who went through a lot and still struggles with depression. I welcome advice even if it isn't helpful.

I don't know what you've gone through but one thing I've learned is that it doesn't really matter. You can have a seemingly perfect life but you can still be depressed. Other people can go through hell and not be depressed at all. It's how your brain is wired which can be affected by both genetics and you're environment. It may not be possible right now, but work on getting in a better environment, maybe get a fresh start. Talk it out with people and just try your absolute hardest to think more positive. Instead of focusing on the bad, focus on the good. I'm not saying you'll be perfectly fine all of a sudden because depression sucks, but it's a step in the right direction. Please don't give up and if you are myopically focused on getting better, you will see results. Good luck, hang in there."

Deep,f30984f,t1_f2zovtj,1570549279.0,"I can definitely feel that. I don't do many drugs, really only marijuana and nicotine, but I'd like to try shrooms because of the effects it has on depression and anxiety and mental health as a whole. Yet, when I smoke, I feel like it adds happiness in my life and I can actually relax and enjoy life. It's something that I can look forward to after a long day of work. Others see it as just being lazy and wanting the next high, but for me, it helps stabilize some emotions. At the same time, though, it seems like I think a lot more when high and I want to slow down the thoughts sometimes and it's hard.

Another thing is since I had my depression and told people after it got too much, a cry for help really, I realized what's fucked up. Everyone tells you if you have these thoughts, tell someone. Someone will help you. Yet, what I noticed was I was being outcast. Sure, people would talk to me about it and try to make me feel better, but again, I wasn't relating to them so I seemed weird to others. Then I had some ""friends"" that said I was doing it for attention and that hurt. Ever since all of that, I just hide these emotions when I get them because I don't know who to trust. No one truly knows how to react, not friends or family. And I don't want to get thrown in some loony bin again because that was the worst week of my life. And then, some, not all, get a sense of entitlement. They feel good about themselves because they've ""helped"" you through your struggles because they listened to you. Yet they don't realize it's not just that you are sad and you need a pick me up to help you through your day and then you're happy again. You need love and understanding and not antidepressants and medication. People don't realize you can be happy and depressed at the same time, but the happiness is fleeting. I can go to a party, have a great time, laugh with friends, etc. But once I'm left with my own thoughts, it can get really tough. Suicide is a thought that I don't think I'll ever go through with, but it's intriguing. You could literally find out what's on the other side today and if there's a god or an afterlife. But I can't ever go through with it because I think of my mom who last week bought me cookies and made me chicken and dumplings for college. I think of my Dad, who taught me to ride my bike when I was little. I think of my brothers, my friends, even just acquaintances and I can't do it, and that's why I know I won't. It's a scary moment and I feel I'd rather let my life end naturally, but it's hard to live through the emotion and the pain

Thanks for sharing! Hope you are successful at managing your depression and fighting through it! I know I just kind of threw up another rant, but if you ever need to talk about it, I think I can relate and help."
