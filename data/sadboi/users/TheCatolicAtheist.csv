Advice,fpeozuy,t3_gbw4qy,1588551876.0,"We're in the same boat, check r/PanicAttack, or just search for cardiphobia, there are a lot of people like us here.Im 17/m too, slim and healthy, did 3 ekgs, 1 echo, and blood and tyroid tests, everything clear.I still cant stop panicking from the slightest chest pain.I go to a psychologyst but seems that since I made this account a few days ago and found out there are a lot of people like me it helps more.When I was 15 I could go to raves, drink vodka, beer, smoke a few joints and cigarettes....Now just eating a bit too much causes me to have palpitations and thinking that im unhealthy and my arteries are clogged, same if I only take a puff from a cigarette, I instantly notice my heart rate and I panic."
Panicattacks,fpembdq,t3_ffrxqz,1588550309.0,"Im so glad im not the only one.So I dont know the reason I started to have panic attacks, but a year ago I started to smoke less weed because somehow it started to make me feel anxious, and then it gave me panic attacks.And I became cardiophobic and I was like ,,wtf I could smoke weed and be chill and now its the complete opposite,, So I decided to smoke a lot less, just a puff and control my toughts, but it just became worse.So last summer, one night I decided to tell my parents that I will sleep at my grandma (who is in the same house, different appartment) so I can smoke weed.She falls asleep, I go to the living room and pull out my bong, pack a big bowl with kief on top and smoke. And I dont remember how it happened, but I became very anxious, and my heart was pounding really fast.I decided ti listen to Paganini but any sound just made  me panic more and I just pulled the headphones out of my ear, went to the bathroom and I looked in the mirror and told myself ,,you are not going to have a panic attack again, you ar totally fine,, and it felt so weird looking at myself and saying these and I couldn't breath (omg just typing and remembering makes me panic again lol).And I got out of the bathroom and went on the hallway and I tought I was dying and for a moment it was so intense I started to have tunnel vision.Then I was wondering if Im really having a heart attack and if I should call the ambulance or something, but I was also thinking ,,If I actually dont, the ambulance will come and Im high as shit, all my neighbours will hear the ambulance and come out and see my like that, and my dad would probably yell and make me feel worse because he sees weed like heroin.All these toughts made me feel like fainting and my heart was hurting and bearing faster.So I layed on the floor, and fortunately my granda has tiles and they were really cold even in the summer, so its like a cold shower kinda, but I was so awful that I was getting uo fo run thinking that my heart would probably stop or something if I fall asleep on the floor.Then after 4 hours I went to bed and even if the bed was the most fluffy and comfortable I couldn't stop feeling like vibrating and my heart beting in my head and every inch of my body.I dont wish this on my worst enemy."

PanicAttack,fp4dav6,t1_fp4anns,1588296608.0,"im not taking any meds, but my mom is a pharmacist and if i really have a bad panick attack at night I go and ask her for something, she usually gives me some plant based bs.But it sucks right?And at the ER when they see that u are just panicking they just move very slow, last time I waited 3 hours for the blood results, and the lady that took the Xray told me to come with her, and we walked around the endless and dark hospital hallways and she even stopped to talk to a nurse for 10 minutes."

also you reminded me that I use to call energy drinks ,,can-o-palpitations,, lol"
PanicAttack,fp47jvt,t1_fp45r3m,1588293265.0,"Thank you.Yes you are right, if I would give up bad habits I want it to be because I want to, not because of anxiety.And I forgot to say that I feel very unhealthy.I mean, when I stay in the evening and watch series and eat salty popcorn I have pains or palpitatations and think that its because of the unhealthy snacks.And I feel that any food that my mom cooks is unhealthy (Romanian food) and then I eat vegetables and drink plenty of water and it never seems like a healthy diet."

Anxiety,fovuftk,t3_g8v0l8,1588107710.0,"It sucks, in our country(Romania) they closed schools when there were only 15-20 confirmed cases, and now they will open them again, at over 11.600 cases.405 cases being in my city, and my highschool is a few meters away from the Hospital for Infectious Diseases.I get it, education is very important, but still, for most of the students  going to highschool it means comuting between 2 public transport vehicles each morning, and 2 when going back home.The buses and trams are full everyday, and being so close to 50 people in each vehicle, times 4 vehicles a day, and also the people from school....it doesn't sound safe at all, and a shitty mask wont protect you.The hospitals are already flooded with infected patients, I just imagine how it will be in 20-30 days when there will be no restrictions.The mask will be mandatory, just the mask... -_-"
