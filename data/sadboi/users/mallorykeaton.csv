EarHustlePodcast,fpx2dlk,t1_fpue4q3,1588974361.0,"Hi, is it exploration or exploitation? I use the term Child Sex Abuse Material. I think both are equally disgusting to most folks. Equating porn with the systematic undoing of a child does not get the point across."
EarHustlePodcast,fpx24xh,t3_g6zwqc,1588974231.0,"I listened to this episode this morning. My brother was raided by the FBI last year, and subsequently charged with possession of CSAM by the state he lives in. He also abused me when I was a child and young adult, and I know of other instances where he has put children in harm‚Äôs way. Those other instances were about 20 years ago when he was 19 and the victim in the matter would‚Äôve been about 14 (same age as me the first time I can vividly remember the act). I don‚Äôt know any details, and in fact, only remembered this instance within the last weeks.

I am now absolutely no contact with him, and have been extremely low contact for many years. His wife stayed. With their two children. My parents try to defend it. They pay all his bills and even invite him and his family over instead of my sister; I live 3,000 miles away, thank god. And they all sound exactly like Del. 

I don‚Äôt tend to argue out loud with podcasts, but Del‚Äôs position on the matter was viscerally painful and abhorrent to me, and I found myself replying to her as if it were my mother. The children in those images are sex slaves. And her husband (and my brother) contribute(d) to their slavery. Her husband, and my brother, should be nowhere near children. Including their own. They should be locked up AND they should be receiving extensive mental health care. There is not a fine line between fantasy and action. 

I love Ear Hustle, and I am in awe of how the team handled this situation. I was especially struck when Nigel ‚Äúchallenged‚Äù the man who stabbed another man about whether or not he‚Äôs going to heaven.

If you‚Äôve read this far down, thank you. This episode touched me, and I‚Äôm glad it was produced, but I hope Del gets herself and her children out of that man‚Äôs way."
