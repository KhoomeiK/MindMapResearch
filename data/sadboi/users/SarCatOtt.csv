zoloft,feliasg,t1_felfl9r,1579222839.0,I’m so glad to hear that!
zoloft,fekvwp7,t1_fektpuy,1579208694.0,"Well I’ve managed my anxiety without drugs for 30+ years and it wasn’t until recently (for reasons I don’t have to explain to you) that my anxiety snowballed out of control.  In theory, you can trick your brain to NOT respond with anxiety in the same way your brain tricks you into being being anxious.  My hope is that I can successfully go off of Zoloft toward the end of the year and go back to managing my anxiety through other means.

I should also clarify that Zoloft doesn’t make me “feel good” like a high.  It makes me feel like myself again.  It’s improved the lives of my husband and children, who were beginning to suffer due to my anxieties.  

I am not addicted to Zoloft.  It is not the same thing.  And my experience has absolutely nothing to do with the stigma addicts have to endure."
zoloft,feks81i,t1_fekq75k,1579206521.0,"Ah, well.  I was taking the klonopin as prescribed and didn’t have any problems stopping sooo 🤷‍♀️"
zoloft,fekog0c,t1_fekgumz,1579204290.0,"Thanks!  I think I started at 50 and went up to 100 (with a couple days of smaller increments before getting to those doses).  I was using the klonopin (0.25-1mg) for 4-8 weeks, as needed, to help with the start-up side effects (increased anxiety, sleep problems, etc).  After a couple weeks on 100mgs of Zoloft, my anxiety was pretty much in control so I just sort of stopped the klonopin.  But I’d get a racing heart and some jitters here and there so I’d take a little bit every couple days.  I still have trouble sleeping soundly.  I can fall asleep but I toss and turn a lot.  Taking benedryl def helps.  I’ve always been a tossy-turny sleeper anyway though.

I remember being apprehensive to start Zoloft and put it off for a good year or so, partly because I was still breastfeeding my youngest and the thought of not breastfeeding him made me anxious haha.  But also - shocker - I had a lot of anxiety about starting a medication that I would have to be on all the time and that also has an intimidating list of start-up side effects.

SO the point of my original post was basically for anyone thinking of starting or in that uncomfortable start up phase.  5 months may seem like an eternity to them, but I’ve been feeling back to myself for a while now and in the grand scheme of things - your life - a couple months is just a blip.

Good luck everyone!"

zoloft,f44dkic,t1_f44c4td,1571350736.0,"Yup just about 8 weeks now, 5 weeks at my current dose.  I was taking klonopin to help with side effects and sleep the first month.  Now I’ll just pop a benedryl or two for sleep but will probably skip it this weekend (when I don’t have to worry about getting up for work) and see how my sleep is.

My younger son, who is 3, is a daredevil who actively tries breaking himself ALL. THE. TIME.  Now I’m like, meh if he breaks, he breaks.  We have good hospitals nearby lol.  My husband can also attest to my calmer disposition."
zoloft,f446zsk,t1_f446bcj,1571348735.0,Do it!  I’m down 35lbs and my anxiety is non-existent.  I knew it was really starting to affect my life but I didn’t realize how bad it was.  I am enjoying my life and my kids so much more now that I’m not all knotted up about things that can go wrong.  I feel amazing and am a little mad at myself for not starting sooner when my doc first suggested it.

zoloft,f2t340i,t3_de36ro,1570390323.0,"Might want to find a new doctor.  Side effects are SUPER common (particularly in the first week) and you should have been advised as such, as well as ways you can manage them.

In any event, try to stick it out at least a week.  That’s def the hardest part and hopefully after that, the good will outweigh the bad.  I’m six weeks in and still get nausea about the same time each day.  I’m taking it for anxiety and have been feeling SOOO much better.  Good luck!"
zoloft,f22d3g8,t1_f22bwrh,1569886646.0,"The heartburn!  It didn’t even occur to me that was from the Zoloft.  I had to ask a coworker for tums today, which was confusing since I had only eaten some yogurt at that point in the day.

I actually made some huge diet changes a couple months back and have lost a lot of weight so getting my anxiety under control now finally feels like I’m getting back to the free spirit (and thinner) me of 15 years ago.

That said, I really want to sleep without the help of klonopin.  I’m going to take benedryl tonight.  Seems less dicey than becoming dependent on a controlled drug I’m building a tolerance to."
zoloft,f227y84,t1_f2253et,1569883818.0,How long have you been on 100mg?  I’m three weeks into 100mg (six weeks total on the drug)...I’m wondering if the nausea and bad sleep are going to level out soon.
Anxiety,f1mgfbc,t3_d9qsam,1569593328.0,"That’s great!  The more you push through anxious situations, the more you will trick your brain into not tricking you into feeling anxious 🤪"
zoloft,f1mfy1n,t1_f1jqe6s,1569593010.0,"Yes!  It’s great!  I just don’t want to become dependent on it or have to keep increasing it.  I’m told I’m taking a pretty low dose though and my doctor said, in theory, everything should mellow out and I won’t need it (for mid-day anxiety).  She didn’t specifically mention whether my sleep would improve though.  Just that it would be okay to double the dose if need be.  That said, I took the normal .5mg pill last night and slept good (not great).  But the idea of running out and not having an emergency anxiety drug gives me anxiety (ahhh the vicious cycle).  I can’t even enjoy booze anymore because I start to panic I’ll need a klonopin and don’t want to like, die in my sleep from the combination."
zoloft,f1mffta,t1_f1io1v2,1569592674.0,"Thanks!  How long have you been on Zoloft?  Have the benefits been outweighing the crappy sleep?

I’ve used melatonin in the past (prob 12 years ago) and I don’t recall it helping much.  I think I’m going to wean down/off the klonopin and then try melatonin again.  At this point I think my body would just scoff at that attempt.  

I wonder if it’s safe to try benedryl.  That stuff knocks me out."
zoloft,f1i37pr,t3_d9ipxl,1569505261.0,"I’m 35 and have had (somewhat) manageable anxiety for a long time but it really ramped up after having my second kid 3 years ago.  I started 50mgs of Zoloft about 5 weeks ago.  The first week was hard (jittery, nausea, dizziness, weird dreams) but I was managing with klonopin.  

I rechecked with my doctor at week 3 and we decided to go up to 100mgs so I’ve been doing that for two weeks now.  I’m having intermittent jitters and trouble sleeping if I don’t take klonopin.  I’m afraid I’m taking too much klonopin.  Since I’ve technically been on Zoloft for 5 weeks, I feel like I shouldn’t be having side effects anymore but I’m still only 2 weeks into the doubled up dose.

I overall feel MUCH better.  There are have been many occasions where I was super chill about a situation that would have previously given me an immediate Adrenalin rush and knot in my stomach.

At this point I’m wondering if I should keep taking klonopin to help me sleep or if not great sleep is just part of my life now.  I know I shouldn’t take klonopin long term but if I don’t need to suffer while adjusting to the Zoloft, why should I?  

I guess my biggest concern right now is whether my intermittent side effects and crappy sleep are me still adjusting to the Zoloft or me getting addicted to the klonopin.  I’ve been taking .5mg - 1mg of klonopin on most days.  I didn’t take any last weekend and sleep was rough.

That’s my story, so far!"
Parenting,etsbw81,t3_by2ih8,1563141582.0,We’re in a same boat.  Our second son (almost 3) has this electricity running through him that comes out in destructive/dangerous/impulsive/inappropriate ways.  It’s not “just toddler” behavior.  We have a consult with his pediatrician later this week.
