I'm surprised she doesn't already have a rehabilitation therapist. I was specifically speaking on talk therapy, which it does not seem like she would respond well to at this current time. I think it would be fantastic if she could get some mental health therapy right away as well, but speaking from experience, it seems like introducing the idea of talk therapy right now would not be a positive experience. 

I think a rehabilitation therapist is a great suggestion though. I dealt with a lot of medical issues when I was in heavy mental health therapy and it was helpful to have someone (in my case, a nurse practitioner that I saw regularly) that I knew wouldn't freak out about my issues and would deal with them professionally and scientifically. Definitely helped me cope with the physical healing side and some of the mental healing.

If you add this on right now, she will probably reject the idea of therapy right away. 

Focus on getting you and the rest of your family therapy to help support her, and show her how helpful it is instead of just telling her. Words won't help much right now, speak through your actions. The letter is a great idea too."

Everyone reacts very differently, even if you don't have pre-existing medical conditions. If she does decide to try it, be very cautious and start very slowly with one small hit. Make sure you stay with her and that she's in a calm and safe environment. Some psychologists would suggest never trying it, others would say tread with extreme caution. 

Sometimes my hallucinations are heightened by weed, but I'm pretty comfortable with them and they haven't been threatening in years. That's another thing to consider... if her normal hallucinations or delusions are very threatening, I would stay away.

Then I started acting crazy and when my family would leave the house, I would search it top and bottom for people hiding or bugs or hidden speakers and I found nothing. 

Finally, I went to a friend's house and heard the voices. I started freaking out and telling her that the people had followed me.
