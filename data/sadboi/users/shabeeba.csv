depression,eq8vzk0,t3_bxnk4u,1559877034.0,"Same. I had treatment and all, and I myself thought I had beaten it. But it just bounced right back when I was most vulnerable: at night.

The night is the worst time of the day for me. I used to enjoy my nights, reading story books and drawing. Now it’s like a race for the morning, and every doubt and fear creeps up on me. My depression is most definitely not gone.

Keep living friend. That’s all you need to do. Life is beautiful if you learn look past the pain. I’m still trying."

I feel you. Every day is a struggle not to give in to myself. It hurts because the only real way out is to end it all, and that's not the way I want to lose. It's not the way anyone should lose.

Stay alive, stay safe, never give up. It gets better."

Give life a shot. It’s the only one you’ll get.

Remember it gets better, and you are not alone in your suffering."
