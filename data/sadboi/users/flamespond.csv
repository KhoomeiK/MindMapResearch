ucsccola,fmnv93p,t1_fmnuyvq,1586236275.0,">Hi all,   
>  
>In the past few weeks, undergraduates have been circulating a petition and organizing in order to demand spring tuition back. The reasons behind this demand consist of the facts that:  
>  
>We did not sign up or pay for online education when we enrolled in UCSC  
>  
>UCSC fired 80+ graduate students for fighting for their basic human rights  
>  
>We are paying on campus fees for a campus we physically cannot access  
>  
>The university gives us zero transparency about where our money is going, and zero control over what they spend it on  
>  
>In this petition (see some results below) hundreds of undergraduates said that they would be un-enrolling or under-enrolling from the university while even more expressed other ways in which they would be addressing the way the university has failed to act in the best interest of its students. We would like to invite you to continue or join in this organizing effort and send an email to UCSC admin and the regents to let them know the results of this petition and that undergraduates are demanding a refund for our spring quarter tuition. We should not be expected to pay the same amount for an education that has been greatly impacted. Please join us in showing the administration that we will hold them accountable for their unresponsiveness and unwillingness to meet the needs of their students and workers. Use [***this***](https://tinyurl.com/canceltuition) link to send an already formatted email to the administration, and spread the attached flyer to demand your tuition back.

You go to see them once or twice for an intake appointment and they’ll give you a list of therapists to see. The co-pay is $10 a week with UCSHIP insurance. I’ve only seen one therapist in my years here so I can’t speak for everyone but I’ve had a great experience with them. As for psychiatric stuff you generally go to CAPS to meet with a psychiatrist and they’ll prescribe you medication which you can get at the pharmacy on the ground floor. You can also see a case manager at CAPS and they’re pretty great if you need extra services.
