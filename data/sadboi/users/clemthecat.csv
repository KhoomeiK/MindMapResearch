Zoomies,fr1qgp9,t1_fr1pgrh,1589824207.0,"I think it also depends on the breed of dog you have too. Like if you've got a Chihuahua or a Yorkie they might be content with walks around the block and some snuggles, whereas if you have a working breed, a husky or something then I can understand trying to get in hiking and some other stimulating activities like agility, nose work, doggy daycare etc. But honestly, if you are giving your dog plenty of love and affection and it's getting at least regular walks I don't think it needs hours of exercise EVERY day. 

I have a Scottish terrier and we usually do one walk a day with doggy daycare daily (up til everything close due to COVID). Also we are up at our cottage all the time so she is always outside off leash chasing squirrels and enjoying an unfenced yard, swimming, or sunbathing. She is perfectly happy. But again, she is a small dog with short little legs and is satisfied with that amount of activity. It varies, but I think that what you are suggesting is pretty extreme and a bit overkill."
Zoomies,fr1i5rh,t1_fr15zuq,1589820145.0,"Not enough? How much would you say is enough, then? I don't think it's realistic for people to be constantly walking or running their dogs hours and hours every single day- people have to go to work and do other things. Your dog will be perfectly happy with a yard, walkies and some loving each day. You don't need to walk it like 6 times a day or take it on a 10k hike all the time. It doesn't mean we ""don't have time for a dog"", it means we're realistic and have lives."
Zoomies,fr1hvhd,t1_fr154o6,1589820003.0,"People are ridiculous with some of their ""abuse"" claims. That is in no way abuse, lol. As long as your dog is getting the chance to exercise at some point in the day, I can guarantee you it's a happy pup. There's no need to go overboard with it!"

It sucks.
