We thought it was blood at first but then it didn’t seem right, and his behavior was normal. Like zoomies normal in between quick stops to use the bathroom. 

So I was sitting there thinking and I remembered I fed him about 2-3 of the beet treats over the past 6 hours. 35 pound dog. I’m obviously going to monitor it more to make sure it’s nothing more serious. But all three of my dogs just went to the vet about three weeks ago and had all of their bloodwork, tests done for their annual exam."

It’s a perfect slightly fruity but also woodsy scent on me. I actually wish the passion fruit stayed a bit more prominent and I generally don’t like fruit in my perfumes that much.
Indiemakeupandmore,ffajaqq,t1_ffadhyq,1579737123.0,Seriously. 11 hours later and the lotion still has a great throw it’s INSANE!!!
Indiemakeupandmore,ff9dx5a,t1_ff90tju,1579710907.0,Agreed with everything said here!! Some transfer is okay but I prefer to only have to reapply after eating vs. after drinking out of my water bottle and a cup of coffee.

Indiemakeupandmore,ff9djos,t3_es8fqm,1579710657.0,"Used **Soak and Unwind** *Pumpkin Spice Latte* in their coffee scrub in the shower. Got out and moisturized with **CocoaPink’s** *Breakfast at the Beach* in their voluptuous body butter. It is INCREDIBLE, I smell like a slightly strawberry angel food cake. The throw on the body butter is insane - I took off my jacket at work and I could smell it wafting through the air. I can still smell it now with my sweater on and the space heater blowing at me. Will definitely RP and probably try it out in a perfume to layer as well. Overall I’ve been BLOWN AWAY by all of my purchases from Cocoapink’s Black Friday sale. I can’t wait to buy more. I also sampled **Vintner’s Reserve** *Felix Felicis.* it’s definitely overpowered by Breakfast at the beach, and a scent I think I’ll save for summer. It’s wearing as EXTREMELY fruity on me, which is not how it wore on most of the reviews I saw. Notes are - clovers, pineapple, orchids, jasmine, crushed vanilla bean and copal resin. I was looking for more of a vanilla/floral/fruit mix, and as of right now I’m getting  peaches blended nicely with the fresh cut grass. I’ll have to try again when I’m not wearing a strong lotion."

We also made a stop to old key west to check it out since we’re looking into DVC with key west being a top contender and we did notice that the decor/building design looked kind of similar to each other (to our delight). The skyliner is AMAZING though.
Indiemakeupandmore,fel7n1l,t1_fekjevh,1579215812.0,"I didn’t notice any actually. I could pick out gardenia, but in a very cool way. When I tried it the phrase “ice queen” came to mind.

Today, I chose a free sample of **she wore blue velvet** to try out. Oh my GOODNESS I am in love. It feels spring-ish to me and somehow perfectly fits the unseasonably warm New England weather today. I may FS this. 

Notes from alpha are: A heavy dose of soft cool blue gardenias, rich blue egyptian musk, rich vintage velvet, cream, and real Shea blended with pure Mysore sandalwood all dashed with a bite of black pepper"

We got him because the woman who we rescued sonic from adopted a puppy to my state and they were having problems with him (didn’t know how to handle a puppy) so she asked if we could emergency foster because we have for her before. The minute I saw his picture I knew if he came to my house he wouldn’t be leaving. He’s a Dalmatian mix with a spot over his eye....so precious. 

I picked him up, brought him home and FaceTimed my husband. “Hey babe tell me how much you love me” “why?” *Flips camera* “WHAT IS THAT?” 😅😆

There are 12 individually wrapped presents in there, and the wrapping paper is all animal themed! Each little gift is labeled with a number. I can’t wait to start opening them!"

Indiemakeupandmore,f9laib3,t1_f8uey4z,1575418355.0,Your feedback is so interesting to read!!! I’ve definitely made three orders in the last month since your brand has been so hyped and I felt I’ve vibed with your scent descriptions well. Love the humor. I’m still new to the indie world and relatively new to fragrance - 2-3 years and the first two years were spent trying and hating most department store fragrances lol. But remember reddit is here rooting for you!!!!!
Indiemakeupandmore,f9krxl2,t1_f9kavtc,1575406655.0,Oh my goodness the N A M E I’m obsessed.
Indiemakeupandmore,f8z2sd8,t1_f8ywkoy,1574956171.0,I definitely don’t because of all the orders I placed haha. But I’m getting two fragrances for my husband!
Indiemakeupandmore,f8yhpi6,t1_f8xd89e,1574947404.0,Did you hear about a Black Friday sale for deconstructing Eden?
Indiemakeupandmore,f8cwede,t3_dz7f4i,1574471251.0,Anyone know about deconstructing Eden?!??

Indiemakeupandmore,f7nlpax,t1_f4gwfe5,1573909714.0,"Update - I bought him a sample of Delaunay and he LOVES it. It’s now his favorite scent ever! I also got him Romeo and Mercutio as well since they seemed to be up his alley, and Romeo was a huge hit as well. I’ll be buying him full sizes for Christmas! I told him that a kind redditor helped to guide me, thanks much!!!"
Indiemakeupandmore,f7nllzk,t3_dx3mr7,1573909601.0,"Just tried my sample of Ghost Puffs by house of Gloi. My four month old puppy is currently trying to bite my hand off because he thinks I am hiding food from him because of how realistic the scent is. It smells amazing, however in the future I’d rather have this in some sort of body care I.e. the pumpkin butter as opposed to perfume - I generally prefer my super gourmand scents that way. However as I spent my morning in bed, Ghost Puffs is just lovely!!!"
