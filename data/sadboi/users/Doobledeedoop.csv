I have it! I just manage it because I don't want to be depressed and waste my life. You are clearly all up in your head, because everything you are saying is incredibly myopic. I have also been really depressed and had very similar mindset as this, so I completely understand your perspective. But it's not true. You're just trying to justify your sadness. If you really don't think that your enviornment changes your mood, then you are simply wrong. It does. Being around assholes brings you down, does it not? If you had to chose between hanging out with kind people or negative assholes, who would you choose? Anyway, I'm sorry you aren't capable of understanding what I said right now.

I enjoy outdoor extreme activities, I'm not saying you do. I'm not saying it is as simple as go outside you'll feel better, but you do need to at least try to break the cycle if you actually want to feel better, and that might be a different step for you than for someone else. I'm sorry but no, most people don't work 2 jobs to survive. Some do, perhaps alot do, but no, not most. And if you do work 2 jobs then do you have an hour a week to spend doing something nice for yourself like taking a stroll or eating lunch outside(not always desireable)? Sometimes I don't take a lunch(I work 10 hour days) which sucks, but when I do I like to spend even 5 minutes outside because it makes me feel better. Not happy or anything, but better, content.

Edit: also nothing I said was pretentious. You chose to take it that way. I get that depression can cause irritability, but don't get angry at people for suggesting things. If you've heard it a million times, it's probably because there is some truth in their words for you to discover. There isn't a magical on and off switch for depression.

The obvious answer then, is that he cannot be out of his crate at night because he's not responsible and he doesn't make good choices. Going back to what I said, that exercise when you make the dog wait for the ball, tires the dog out more because they have to use their brain. You need to start making him think on top of his exercise and play time. And you need to work on teaching him he can't chew on things that aren't his toys."

Make it longer every time. Maybe wait till he gives tou eye contact. There are also treat games you can buy that make the dog have to think about getting treats to come of of different holes. Make sure he has an abundance of toys to play with. Start talking with a dog trainer about more advanced training. He needs some kind of stimulation he's not recieving. He might have some separation anxiety, but it more likely is him getting bored. You have to start making him think out his energy instead of just running it.

unpopularopinion,flozkck,t1_floucr6,1585348678.0,"An emotional support dog is not a service dog. In fact there is no ""criteria"" for them to meet. If you aren't willing to get your dog actually certified and pass the CGC, you don't deserve a service dog, and you have no business bringing them in public. But like I said, if your dog is ever attacked by another dog, you have to actually do something about it. No shit the dog won't react well. It's your responsibility to help your dog cope and move on. Your dog is your responsibility from the moment you first bring them home, to the moment you say goodbye. It's like having a child, there are always setbacks you will have to face."
unpopularopinion,floiuhv,t1_fln7qvj,1585339135.0,"A lot of how your dog reacts has to do with how you react. Why are you allowing him to be aggressive? Would you allow your child to act out toward every older kid if they were attacked by bullies? How are you handling the situation to allow your dog to respond in such a way? If you don't know what to do, then why not ask a professional? Yeah your dog is going to distrust strange dogs after that, but is it okay to let him feel that way? No, so you work on that sort of behavior. It's not an excuse to be a lazy dog owner. ""Oh no, my dog was attacked and now he doesn't like other dogs. Guess I won't do anything about it."" It's just as lazy as not using a leash."
unpopularopinion,floi8om,t1_flnmo7h,1585338809.0,"I do think it's worth pointing out how abnormal it is for a service dog to go from 100% fine at their job to having to stop working as the result of a random dog attack. A professionally trained dog doesn't pull a 180 like that. It's unfortunate it happened, but a good dog won't let that ruin them. How you handle and cope with the situation is going to determine how your dog deals. Too many of you dog owners baby your dogs in areas they need to be pushed, and push is areas they need to be soothed. I see it all the time. My dog has been attacked before. He used to start shit with other dogs(usually pits, the breed of dog that went after him) and I discouraged the behavior every time. If he got rude with another dog, he was corrected and separated immediately. Now he can have a run in with my parents aggressive dog, and he just looks away and ignores him. He knows he's not allowed to engage in that sort of behavior,  but he also knows he can defend himself if he has to. If your dog is ever attacked, the best thing you can do for them is to keep them socialized and try to brush it off. Redirect any bad habits, like growling at other dogs, and if you struggle with this, you need to call in a professional who can teach you. Just because one person was lazy with their dog and let it attack yours doesn't give you an excuse to bitch about how your dog just isn't the same and blah blah. Yeah dude, I'm sorry but you are always going to be training and working with your dog. That means dealing with conflict resolution(dog fights)."

Pets,fj0s16a,t1_fj0ds8i,1582906565.0,"You aren't listening to anyones advice. If you don't start training and working with your puppy everyday, you will continue to have a problem. Why did you get a high energy puppy if you aren't willing to train them? Compressed air is for dusting hard places, not  spraying your dog with. You need to call a dog trainer and start taking classes. The rock eating will end when you stimulate your bored af dogs brain."
DogAdvice,fj0rn6p,t3_fatswp,1582906337.0,"Not only whatthworger comment said, but also chicken isn't the best protein for dogs out there anyway. A fair amount of them have an allergy to chicken, people don't seem to realize."
unpopularopinion,fizpw4g,t1_fiz2rzm,1582870160.0,"To all you asshats who take your ""emotional support dog"" to the groomer and nervously call every hour to see if your dog is done because you can't be without your spoil rotten dog that doesn't listen worth a shit, screw you. I wish they would crack down on the emotional support dogs. It takes time effort and often times money to train a dog and if you aren't willing to do that, you don't deserve a service dog."
