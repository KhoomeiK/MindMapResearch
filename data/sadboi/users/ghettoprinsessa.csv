morbidquestions,fr579ek,t3_gmjbod,1589903734.0,"My ex boyfriend who was abusing me emotionally for months and eventually tried to kill me. I luckily escaped the situation but it has made my PTSD a lot worse. I didn't do anything to deserve that. The world would be a much better place without him and if he died I wouldn't have to be scared of him finding me somehow.

I'm not going to kill him. If it was legal for me to hang him I would do it though. But hopefully his drug use and violent tendencies will kill him sooner or later."

I was raped as a teen too but was lucky in the sense it wasn't recorded. I still struggle with PTSD but it's gotten a lot easier to deal with.
