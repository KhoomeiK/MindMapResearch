My oldest son in the house is Aspergers, my youngest son is ADHD and my youngest girl is an over achiever athlete 4.0 student wired tight like her dad. My wife and have a long history of recovery , working with others.  We both suffer from PTSD.  We are very proactive in our recovery.  Clo is adopted, and bio mom was struggling with addiction m, so her wiring is a we bit off.  But I believe if you bring the body, the mind will fallow.  I’m living proof.  We have a great life.

alcoholism,fbdztuj,t1_fban77b,1576775034.0,"Well, if your an alcoholic artist... and 90% of your art centers around recovery...""the experience"" it too carries a message... for those with an eye to see and a heart to feel with, it's a part of my story. Art is a very powerful healer when words won't do. Art has simply saved my life. This would be a great example of an ego maniac with an inferior complex trying to think his way through sobriety, isolation... when on the ""top of your game."" ;)"

alcoholism,fb98ebx,t1_fb8xca1,1576632023.0,"Thank you, your very kind.  I do write, have since I was ten-years old, still have my first book! lol   Yeah, I'm  just basically now getting plugged into social media with my writing. My sons told me to get on reddit...blog and plug in, so far so good, a little surprised with how well people resonate with my writing. Its nice... makes me feel that much more connected.  I'm an artist as well, went to (AIS) major was graphic design/illustration, so I will post art here within the span of 30 years, that is centered around my recovery as well. :) pek65.blogspot.com"
alcoholism,fb4ho8x,t1_fb2kbc7,1576509165.0,"Thank you... friend,  that was like thirty years ago, I was in a brief relapse.. trying to find my bottom, and I did, right there at the Fireside Tavern. The heart is still the same, an old sap. I simply love people, I cant help it,  the more broke they are, the more I love them.  I do my best to treat myself right.

alcoholism,fathss9,t1_fat1hvn,1576338379.0,"Thank you, sounds like you got a handle on your sobriety, kudos on that first and foremost. It truly does get more manageable with time.... time matters. Yeah, the idea of any of my babies even remotely going through what I did makes me shiver, scares the shit out of me... but, they have been given the opportunity to see the other side of the coin form the get-go. Many do not get that opportunity, and I think that is the difference.  I sobered up at twenty-four years old a late-stage alcoholic. My first drink-drunk was at five years old, but I suspect earlier. I am writing a story and its called 'MudPi', I've been writing for ten-years... I'm midway in the story now for the first time ever, its been very difficult to write because of CPTSD, I've gone into downward spirals trying to write it.  Its a bit of a mess in manuscript form but I'm get'n there. I've spent decades working through my trauma/alcoholism and still see a therapist(PHD). I look back and it almost doesn't seem real... which is why I am driven to finish this book... autobiography. We need more awareness of the 'Reality' of alcoholism and recovery. I plan on writing series of short stories...centered around my experience in the past three decades of my recovery.  I built from ground up a recovery-house in the early nineties (THRH) when only a year sober, facilitated it 24-7 eight-days a week for five years while going to Art School(AIS) before I rotated out. I could write a book around that experience alone... tragic and funny.  My next work will be 'fictional' and lighten it up but centered around sobriety-recovery.  God I have so many heart-warming funny stories I want to write...so that their never forgotten.  pek65.blogspot.com"
mentalillness,fapceqr,t1_f9uypxd,1576285402.0,"I've been writing my story for ten long years...  called 'MudPi' and its about CPTSD, Addiction, and thirty years of successful recovery. I'm a freaking miracle. I'm just now publishing some manuscripts... on my blog, ( pek65blogspot.com) posting artwork etc.  Few years back there were several publishers hounding me for my story.... but it wasn't time, more was revealed to me and I needed to work through that crap. Its difficult to write about trauma and not feel it to some degree... but very healing, albeit with a therapist at my side making sure I down go into a downward spiral. Its happened several times before trying to finish this story, so I had to find a different way to get the story out.  Its still messy in draft form but I wanted to put it out there, and see what the tide would wash up. I'm still ironing out dates, timelines, etc., my sis helps fill in the gaps I can't remember(fully). I remember things my sis can't, and vise versa.  I'm happy with the reception I have received so far about what I've written hitherto.  I had to go and buy a new frig'n computer to use reddit... my  Mac was so outdated.  I will be posting more of the same.  ""The Body Keeps The Score"" by Dr. Bessel Van Der Kolk is an excellent read so far. Pete Walker has excellent work as well around the subject."
bipolar,fapa06d,t1_faomg0g,1576283696.0,"Yeah, I've read that too, and its comforting to know I'm not the only alien on the block.  I tested at MENSA in Seattle back in the day to see how stupid I was and scored 148 on the proctored exam... I was really hungover, almost didn't go, I was so sick, but, wow was I shocked by the test results. I guess crazy and genius IQ go hand in hand, my therapist tells me. I think IQ is really misunderstood by most.  When I go into manic phase I build shit on the fly... fix shit, do a lot of artwork, become very creative and energetic, get stuff done. I'm an artist with a lot of tools and I use them all. When I become depressed I write less and do more art-graphics-linework. That is self taught behavior... coping mechanism I've had since I can remember. I just thought I was kinda gifted and cursed.  Before I got into recovery I was in jail a lot... and very wild.   Its so weird, because I have known my whole life I was a wee bit off but never really knew what the hell... like, 'normal people don't drive backwards on the freeways in their Z28' wound out in reverse... doing about 60mph racing to the next off-ramp... outrunning cops HTO etc. or love to drive at 160mph. Very extreme, pushed everything to the limit, including people.   Complex things are simple...simple things are complex... and the whole spiritual connection thang.  Its only been a couple years or so that I got the BP1 diagnosis and on the right meds for the most part... so its still very weird to me to see my life in a different light, things are beginning to make sense to me... like why I did the things I did... what make me tick now.  its all a trip."
bipolar,fao1z6w,t1_fanwbs4,1576255690.0,I was... I'm pretty level now.  I'm still learning much about BPD and CPTSD. Its an uncanny feeling to see things in a different light. Its a lonely feeling at times... My IQ is like 140 plus so that don't help at times lol.  Everything got very real when I began writing my autobiography... and on medication that helps.  I have been asked several times if I was manic when I wrote it... verdict is in lol.  I've been writing since I was ten years old.
bipolar,fantdiy,t1_famx21m,1576250142.0,I struggled with sobriety for ten years before I had clue about being BP1. Truly a bitch... but my life continues to improve in spite of my own stupid ass.  Keep your chin up... none of us can do it alone. :)
bipolar,famwc6f,t3_e9s8k8,1576214830.0, Diagnosed BP1 two years ago... thirty years into my recovery... from alcoholism. Art has saved my life as much as writing.  Always gets me through the storms.  Beautiful work!
bipolar,famfmzw,t3_e8j1ef,1576202708.0,"My sister killed herself at the ripe age of 24. I am bipolar 1, I suffer from CPTSD, I'm a recovering alcoholic/addict thirty years into the program next year, I nearly died twice from a long-drawnout battle with chronic pacreatitis two years ago. My weight went from 210lbs to 130 very quickly.  I was sure I was dying, had a full-blown manic eposode in the mix of it... soughtout a psychotherapist to figure out how to suffer well and die with difnity.  I begged God to take me daily for months, I cried like a fucking baby for hours on the phone with my AA sponsor for months.  I just couldn't off myself because my beautiful Irish sister had already done it for me.   I have recovered from all, my life is good, as good as it get, fuck, may be the best gig in town.  I'd kicked my teeth out one tooth at time backing into the Pearly Gates from Hell had I pulled it off... because Life lifted me back up and gave me all I dreamed of. I was told when I got sobered up in 1991 not to kill myself for at least five years... otherwise I would be killing a stranger, it' been murder.  Sure as shit... they were right.  Recovery is doable... we just gotta jump in the back-pocket of somebody who gives a shit and knows how to get well.  pek65.blogspot.com"
bipolar,famdy7u,t3_csearm,1576201553.0,It stopped working for me... lithium is out of questio need to find better alternative.  Cannabis helps when all else fails but I get sick a feeling stoned.... thought I'd never see the day I said that lol.  Had a full-blown manic episode three years ago and was given a bipolar 1 diagnosis thirty-years into my recovery.  Brought a wee bit of clarity to my life.
