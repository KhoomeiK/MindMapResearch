Take some length off your hair and cut in some choppy layers and make some sideswept bangs.  Use products to add texture, volume and movement. Consider highlights or a couple shades lighter or darker (avoid red due to complexion clash). Shape your brows, use a tinted moisturizer or light coverage foundation to even out skin tone. Apply gel liner to the upper and lower waterline. Mascara!!! Blush to apples of cheeks and tinted lip gloss.

Use YouTube tutorials to learn makeup tip and tricks and what products."

I was on Klonopin (Clonazepam) for years before.  It got BAD.  I became dependant on them and had to take more to get the same effect.  By the time I sought treatment for it I was taking up to 8 a day...the doctors wondered how I was able to function/not dead.  The withdrawal from it not exaggerating almost killed me.  Worst experience of my life (and I've had some awful experiences).  I will never get hooked like that ever again.
