i can totally empathise with how anxiety impacts your life. you mentioned that you had therapy, and it might be good to go again if it's something that you can afford. if not, there are free alternatives online, like 7cups or the samaritans online chat. 

when the anxious thoughts take over, something i've heard is to talk back to them in the same way you'd talk back to an annoying person who's just getting in your way. like, when the thoughts say things like ""you're not going to achieve \[x\]"", mentally reply with ""okay, but that's not going to stop me from trying"". be creative with this - you can take power away from the thoughts by making them feel more like an inconvenience or nuisance rather than an absolute truth that will prevent you from being happy (because, spoiler alert, you *are* going to overcome this).

you could also try channeling your anxiety into creativity - art, poetry, music, anything that expresses it healthily. it could also help you feel good about yourself and proud of having created something.

if you're the kind of person who has lots of worries, things that you just can't rationalise in your head and that get louder and louder until they're impossible to ignore, you could try a few things:  
1. you could write them down in as much or as little detail as you want. then, get rid of the paper - rip it up, burn it, let it dissolve in water. just watch yourself destroy them. it sounds stupid, but it does work sometimes!  
2. set aside a specific 'worry time'. for example, every day from 5-5:15pm, you're going to let yourself think about the worries. when they ambush you outside of that time, tell yourself that you *will* think about it, you *will* solve it, just not yet. by the time your 'worry time' rolls around, they might have dissipated and, if not, you've got some sort of structure to your anxiety rather than it being a constant underlying presence.  
3. if your worries are preventing you from sleeping, picture yourself locking them in a huge box. in your mind, put locks on it, wrap it in chains, whatever it takes to seal it up, then tell yourself that right now is time to sleep, and you can deal with this when you wake/at your set worry time.  
4. talk to people you trust. nobody in the world is 100% anxiety free, and you might find some solidarity in the people that you love. you know what they say - a problem shared is a problem halved!

good luck. you've got this, i believe in you."

AskReddit,fju4vy3,t3_ff11v1,1583613491.0,"allow yourself to feel negative at first. you're naturally going to feel a lot of things - overwhelmed, sad, anxious, etc. processing these will help you to move forward productively, because ignoring them will push them down and they might manifest even more negatively if you bottle them up. after that, focus on what you love about yourself: what you're good at, what you enjoy doing. try and see this as an opportunity or a sign from the universe - it could be the jumpstart you need to go and find the job of your dreams! society puts a lot of worth on how productive we are and how much money we make, when in reality there are things that can be just as fulfilling, if not more. in this tough time, lean on your friends and family for emotional (and potentially financial if necessary) support, and when you're looking for a new job, look for one that you'll genuinely enjoy doing. you never know, your life could go up and up from here! i'm rooting for you."
Advice,fju1ln7,t3_ff0s7o,1583612725.0,"you've already done an amazing thing by acknowledging what could be the beginning of a downward spiral. understanding and pinpointing that you're having a resurgence of self-hatred is, as clich√© as it sounds, the first step to working on overcoming it.

firstly, you've proved to yourself already that these feelings don't have to be forever. two months ago, you were happy, and that's proof enough that you can and will be happy again. sure, it might take time, and it'll be hard, you'll have to push yourself to really advocate for yourself and your mental health, but it is doable.

i'd suggest that it could be helpful to find satisfying things to do both alone and with others. from what it sounds like, you felt happier when you were with friends, a partner, even your roommates. it's good to get social energy from being around others, but feelings of loneliness, at least in my experience, can heighten when you have no other option than to be alone. it might be good to pick up a hobby or two that you can do alone - for me, it was drawing, but you could also find something like writing, music, journalling. whilst things like movies and music are good too, if the thing you're doing involves direct involvement instead of passive watching/listening, it might help as a distraction from the thoughts that get worse when you feel isolated.

as for feeling like people are trying to distance themselves from you, it could very much be a product of projecting your self-hate onto how you think people feel about you. it's unlikely that *all* of your friends suddenly decided that they didn't want to be around you. it might even be that in your depression and worry, you've been subconsciously pushing them away? there's absolutely no shame in asking for reassurance, even a simple text like ""hey man, i've missed hanging out with you recently. you wanna do dinner or something on thursday?"" could work wonders. if there are people that you trust, you might benefit from opening up to them emotionally, which sounds hard (and is at first) but you often find that you can get a positive sense of validation in your relationships if you let yourself be open around those that you love.

and if none of that works? you still have possibilities. i'm trying my hardest to avoid falling into clich√©s, but you could meet new people with similar interests either online or in groups for your interests around your area. if you're in a financial position to do so, i'd also suggest therapy - i personally think that everyone in the world would benefit from a therapist, and they might have some really good practical advice on how to deal with these thoughts before they get worse.

best of luck to you. you've got this."
