BPD,fjykr8n,t1_fjyjtgl,1583698862.0,"Yes!! This is what I was referring to! I’ve been in DBT for two years now, it was truly life changing for me, my therapist is like my god lmao. TIPP is my favorite :) It’s amazing you’re developing a workshop for it, I’m actually in school for psychology so I can be a DBT therapist eventually!"
BPD,fjycsh8,t3_ffdck1,1583694146.0,"Ice pack, a cold shower, or ice directly on the skin. If things are really intense, you can even plunge your face in a bowl of ice water for a couple seconds. It will reset your nervous system and guaranteed you will feel better. Intense physical exercise will do the same and paced breathing, but I have always found ice easiest and most effective when I need a quick calm down."

BPD,eudpvq9,t3_cfdv3u,1563724386.0,I just went without weed for an extended period of time for a year and a half. It felt really good knowing that I didn’t actually need it and then as soon as my “tolerance break” was over and I started smoking again I started using it as a crutch again. Thankfully I’m becoming slightly more self aware about it. Weed isn’t near as bad as other drugs when it comes to physical dependency but psychologically I’m still addicted. Spending $300 a month and being high all the time sucks
BPD,eudo8i5,t3_cfzuax,1563723115.0,"To be honest, it’s really hard, but I’ve done it. You have to remember that while it’s extremely painful, even physically sometimes, you will survive. You will think about them less, and if they are toxic, you start to love them less too, which is scary to hear but it’s a good thing. I was with someone incredibly abusive for 5 years and cut ties. For me things happened slower (he lived with me, he moved out about two months later then we stopped talking) but honestly as much as you might want to talk to them, completely cut contact. I’m really sorry you’re in this situation, break ups are never fun and a BPD person losing their FP is even more difficult. You will survive this!"
BPD,eudn0rf,t3_cfy198,1563722146.0,"Dude I feel you. I’m a borderline majoring in psychology and I want to be a therapist, and truly I love and am good at helping others. If I can help others why can’t I fix myself? That’s not even to say I’m not better and went from “low functioning” to “high functioning” within a year with DBT. But I still do ridiculous shit sometimes because of this illness, and then I feel like a monster all over again. Maybe that’s the black and white brain separating the two parts of ourselves and that’s why this supposed dichotomy exists?"

For me it was after I got super fucking disassociated at my parent’s house and locked myself in a bathroom, disassembled a disposable razor, and left a slash on a random spot on my arm deep enough that I needed 6 stitches. My family ended up calling 911, I ended up in the hospital for the second time (first was my suicide attempt) and was fucking miserable. It was the hospital that initially suggested that I might be borderline (2nd hospitalization in 9 months) and suggested DBT. The entire time I had been in therapy and I had tried multiple medications but nothing worked, but after I got my diagnosis I was able to get on the correct medications that worked for me. I’m on depakote to control my mood swings & effexor for overall depression/anxiety and the combination helped get me to a baseline where I could start regulating my own emotions.
   When I started DBT, which was like a week after the hospitalization, I took it really seriously. I committed to 3x a week therapy (2x ind. 1x group), which I did for about a year and 3 months. I just recently cut group out and am down to 2 individual sessions a week (but I could probably go down to one). I don’t know if it was an epiphany per say, but I just really wanted to feel better. I wanted to stop going to the hospital. I wanted to stop having blowout fights with my family and my boyfriend where I would end up running away. I felt like I was in hell. I couldn’t sleep at night, I called out of work constantly, I wasn’t in school because the last quarter I had taken I failed a class. I was fragile from 5 years of abuse and I was only 19. I felt like my life was on a downward spiral and everything I was doing was ruining it. When I started therapy, I was committed to doing literally whatever to make those feelings go away. If DBT therapy worked for people like me, I was going to make it fucking work for me. (Spoiler alert: it did work. I still have episodes occasionally and suicidal thoughts pop up here and there but I’m feeling like I’m a success story here.)"
