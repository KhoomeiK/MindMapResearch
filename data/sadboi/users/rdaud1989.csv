SuicideWatch,fdgs9ox,t3_eieayu,1578407018.0,"yeah... I am 30 years old Brazilian Living in London since 2008 away from my family and My partner and I just had a baby 6 months ago and and we been together for 4 years, shes Enlgish and we live 5 mina way from her parents and  we never had relationship problems apart from once in a while when my depression gets to me i end up shouting at her but i truly gave her so much loving these whole time, last yeaar feb i lost a really closed cousin of mine and that took my depression to another level and i developed Deah fear phobia which caused me to skip work and college so i could be home with them , now she decided to leave me saying she doesnt want to CARRY ME anymore  that she wants to focus on the kids. I really love her she is the love of my life and when i was talking to her about my depression and phobia she Said i was lying and called me a Narcissist selfish prick and i cant explain how hurtful that was to me,  after she said that my head was rushed with new type of dark thoughts and i started to even google on how to kill myself without pain. I genuly lost interest in living in so much PAIN.  The only consolation in a way was to have found this thread coz it shows me i AM NOT ALONE in THIS SHIT. however im still lost coz i have no idea how to end my pain as i lost powers to fight this ILLNES AND as she has given me no hopes of being with her anymore i rather just no live as my kid is only 6month old and he wont even remember me so it probably not a bad thing for them if i just desappear. dont know what to do"
