MadeOfStyrofoam,fottwe6,t3_g9fct5,1588065974.0,That’s my parents literally today. I asked if I could see a psychiatrist or something and they told me to meditate and stop being so negative all the time ffs. I really thought they would be different but nah. They deadass told their depressed son how much harder it was for them back in their day and that it was my fucking problem. I feel ya.

depression,fob6a5a,t3_g6jgq0,1587656569.0,"Same here. Spent the last 4 years of high school keeping my shit together as best as I can, and when I start to fall apart at the very end everyone hates me for it and thinks I’m slacking off. No one truly cares about me crashing, they just want me to get work done."
2meirl4meirl,fo8y0v6,t1_fo74gxb,1587606244.0,I was relaxing because I thought today was yesterday and my assingments were due tomorrow. Turns out today is today and I’m actually pretty screwed.

BPDmemes,fo5mk2p,t3_g5sm2a,1587529427.0,ikr? Especially OCD. Everyone thinks it’s just some quirky tidiness thing when I’m here having a near panic attack thinking that there’s going to be some divine fucking retribution from the gods themselves if I don’t act symmetrically enough.

korea,fo2clue,t3_g58m37,1587457305.0,"It unfortunately is. The stigma surrounding mental health problems in general is very oppressive. When combined with the tendency of some students to orchestrate organized bullying, I would absolutely recommend concealing this. We are still behind socially in this regard.

And as for scarring, I think there’s very little chance of that happening in your case. Light wounds with scissors tend not to scar easily. From experience, they should be gone in about a week, and the weather’s still pretty chilly to warrant long sleeved clothing. Madecassol also helps. Stay safe out there."
