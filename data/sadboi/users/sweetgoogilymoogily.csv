There’s no real damage which means that all you are doing by scooping up the baby and running away is taking away dad’s chance to parent. You want to fix the baby, even though the baby is fine, and the thing that actually needs to be repaired is the relationship between dad and baby. This practice now will help them to manage being hurt in the real world later."
