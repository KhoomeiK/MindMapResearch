depression,f8b8fvm,t3_dzrccf,1574430289.0,"Hi, I’ve been in this situation also. It’s very rough and hard to get out of. In my case I realized that I was depressed because I didn’t receive love and affection form someone I loved. But I read a book called As A Men Thinketh by James Allen and my entire world change. Basically the book talks about how influential our thoughts can be. I began to think more positive thoughts and positive changes came knocking at my door. Eventually I came to realize that the only love I really needed at the moment was self love. Once I fully accepted myself and fell in love with myself my life changed. I now didn’t depend on anyone else’s acceptance and could truly value the beauty of being alive and in the moment. So keep your head up, fight the good fight, and realize the strength and value the lies deep inside of you."
