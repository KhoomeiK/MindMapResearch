Hello there! I’m 25/F/ TX. 

I would love to have the pleasure to receive your royal letters. Even though I do not do royal letters myself, I do put effort and artistic value into them to make them more personalized to my new friend. 

I’m also into poetry, tea (I would love to exchange), and into talks about dreams and any other cosmic ideas.  Please message me if you’re interested! I hope to hear from you."

tooktoomuch,epkw9hj,t3_buz5zb,1559282328.0,"I feel like in these situations, this would be a tiny bit harder to get the cops involved. Only because they can possibly hear you calling the police. Once they figure out who you’re contacting, they would freak out and possibly have a violent reaction. Like if they were to stop and get off the bus (possibly leave their child behind), or fight you or someone. The people in the back farthest away can probably make the phone call, and just speak at a decent volume. But the people immediately right next to them, probably not the best of ideas for safety reasons alone.  This is assuming they even have enough coherency to be aware of the situation, and not slumping over like this. But I agree, try to contact police as soon as possible."
