I know people who have a glass of wine or a drink daily to wind down. To me, this is a concerning behaviour, it’s not normal, and does amount to ‘serious’ drinking. I’m not an alcoholic and I have drunk a great deal in the past and do have the occasional drink maybe once or twice a month. To the wind down wine or drink people, what they do is normal, not serious drinking ie drunk weekly or daily. 

The roommate could have been more direct even without voicing his past. “I don’t drink. I am uncomfortable around people when they do have a drink.” But at the same time OP should have twigged on the roommate asking about ‘serious’ drinking.

The roommate has offered a reasonable route to the end of the lease. It would be nice if OP was reasonable in return and accept the offer. Maybe a wind down drink outside the apartment?

Yes, he’s definitely an AH over cheating and guilting you.

And while I fully understand why you feel the way you do and want to do what you do, I’d feel the same, it still makes you an AH if you keep him out of the birth.

You and he are going to have to coparent amicably and regardless of how big an AH he is to you you can not let that bleed over onto your child.

Coparenting begins now. Like it or not the birth is not just about the mother. The baby is the center of it all. 

Having a child means your needs come second to theirs. Get used to it now.

She deserves him there. She deserves to feel his presence when she takes her first breath.

One thing though. If you do let him be present, make certain he understands that you are not caving to his guilt, that you simply realised that she deserves to have the best relationship possible with her father from her first breath, so if he fucks it up it’s on his head alone.

And that if he’s smart he’ll be as near to invisible as he can during the process. 

I also know people tend to take immediately post birth pics with the baby, if you’re doing that one day it’ll do her good to see he was there.

I want to break. I want to hit rock bottom. I want to be so far down that people notice and maybe give a damn like they do for people who break. 

Recently my psych asked if I wanted to take medical leave. I declined. If I did that I’d be invisible, and I can’t face that. 

Every day I feel like screaming, but I don’t have the energy for it. What energy I have is used up on doing what needs to be done and wearing the fat suit."

AmItheAsshole,ewfk56y,t3_cnxvrt,1565362654.0,"YTA. You invested someone else’s money without their knowledge and now plan to keep the income from the investment. That alone makes YTA, but this is your children we’re talking about so let’s just double the A part. Also you chose to pay the splurges out of your pocket, fine your choice, no longer something that gets to come out of you son’s (maybe not legally but you gave your word to your son) money.

Right now, you’re a liar with plans on being a thief, instead of being a good father who did the right thing of investing his children’s money for the betterment of their future.

Consider my YTA as your bad dad of the year award."

AmItheAsshole,eugoiya,t3_cgcgmm,1563811920.0,"YTA. I don’t know what you’re thinking. Not at all. Even by your own description it sounds like your daughter loves ballet and loves dancing. When she says she wants to know what he thinks she ... wait for it ... wants to know what he thinks. She’s not just looking for proud uncle praise. Even at a young age ballet is very much about form and posture and she has a loved one who can help her with something she loves. Unless his comments send her into bouts of tears, you are wanting to interfere in a perfectly wonderful exchange between her and her uncle.

Also I found myself troubled by the way you referred to ballet as her hobby, it struck me as sounding almost dismissive of something it sounds like she’s passionate about. Maybe I’m just reading it wrong.

Listen to your wife."

AskReddit,eta1myu,t3_caltkm,1562610201.0,"This is almost 50 years ago now. I was seven and we’d just moved to a new place. It was relatively rural but on the main road. 

I was playing out on the front lawn and had seen someone walking way in the distance. When he reached where I was he asked if he could get some water, which I got him, and if he could have a couple of our crabapples. 

He sat with me on our front lawn eating the apples and drinking the water and answered my multitude of questions for I don’t know how long.

From him I learned that everyone has a story worth listening to and the joy of just traveling without a destination in mind.

I still remember his name.

Note: he was hitchhiking across the country"
EntitledBitch,essuugq,t3_c8r8d3,1562258031.0,"I used to work in a job that, in part, required dealing with customer problems. I also live with depression and anxiety that can make me occasionally take a med that, as I put it, turns off my edit function. Usually when I had to take this med someone would cover the over the top calls. (I worked with great people.)

Once after taking this med I had to field a call from a person with a problem and a huge attitude. I gave up attempting to find out information and simply let them rant. When they finally asked if I was still there I asked what made them think yelling at me was going to make me want to help them.

I think the shock calmed them down and I solved the problem quickly. It was only after the fact that I had the ‘oh crap I shouldn’t have said that’ moment.

I told my boss, but no complaint was ever made and the person remained a customer."
