Also best to keep in mind most classes are easiest before the drop date and increase in difficulty from there. Talk to people in your major that have taken those specific classes. They will give you the most informed opinions. Making sure your ""easier"" beginning classes give you a good foundation for your GPA is important for many. When your classes get harder you'll be thankful that you set yourself up for success early on."

But at community college where I started off all the kids complained together and I felt more like we all had the same struggles. Now that I'm at a university I wonder if these people feel that much more pressure to be perfect in school.

It's less regurgitating what's given to you and more of having a true grasp of the subject. If that isn't what this professor is doing I'm sorry. There's definitely good and bad ways to teach concepts to students. I'd say give them a bit longer and see if it gets any better. If it doesn't you can always reach out to them with your issues. They're there to teach not preach so most professors respond well to politely worded constructive criticism if it means it'll help the class. As for other issues, the same applies only you may just end up teaching yourself, forming strong study groups to compensate, or dropping the class. I wish you luck in all your studies!

buncomfortable,evdmnmr,t1_evd44c2,1564442004.0,Omg thank you for this gift of a sub.
SingleParents,ev16h2b,t3_ci3aqr,1564153092.0,If you have reliable internet I would 100% recommend applying to work from home jobs.
utarlington,eu8kzuu,t1_eu8eq5x,1563559173.0,Thank you! I just might take you up on that. I really need help preparing any way I can.
utarlington,eu8e8gq,t1_eu8dq0f,1563555330.0,So basically you get one class you can retake and all of the rest MUST be passing (C and up)? I'm a transfer student that has most of my basics out of the way so that scares me.
SingleParents,eu7z0hf,t3_cf5t5q,1563546166.0,You're awesome!!! It's so great and healthy that you feel proud of your own accomplishments. Keep that drive up!! You'll do great!
