The mouth hole is bigger, making it easier to slide back and there is no under-nose piece restriction either. But knowing he's got that neck-shield on his cape, I doubt it'll be that. But would be cool!"
Anxiety,fhgbbwy,t3_f31qmf,1581562881.0,That's so awesome! Happy for you.
Anxiety,fhfe6xa,t3_f2rxaj,1581541596.0,"I get that panic sensation in my chest when I wake up. For a few weeks it was even making me throw up every morning before work. That was a nightmare. Breathing can only help so much for me, but what I found helped was chewing gum. I'm not sure why. I think it has more to do with just keeping me distracted as I get ready. Have you spoke to your doctor about medication if you're not already on any?"

LivestreamFail,eyxouhp,t3_czbpl8,1567558788.0,Can someone explain what this is? I've seen it a few times just browsing through channels. A dating show?
MkeBucks,euei7pr,t3_cfvx2g,1563745016.0,"Can someone explain something for me:

I don't live in Milwaukee, but I've been there plenty of times and have seen games at the BC/Fiserv and it's a pretty underrated city. But why do so many outsiders think of it as some sort of third-world country? All I hear (especially from Raptor fans) is ""Oh, you're from Milwaukee."" or ""At least we don't live in Milwaukee."" The city can be pretty and there's plenty to do."
keto,eu97v1l,t3_ce71u2,1563573735.0,Just be careful when you order it. I went to Blaze by me and asked for the Keto crust and they gave me the cauliflower one which is much different.
keto,etzpzsy,t1_eturiru,1563335325.0,"Was it crunchy like normal crust? Issue I've always had with fat head dough or other almond flour recipes, is the dough always comes out soggy like. It all just doesn't feel like pizza to me."
nba,ets3isb,t1_ets2sk1,1563135620.0,Doesn't sound like you've ever been either.
