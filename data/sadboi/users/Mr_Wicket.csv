And yeah the panic attacks felt different than what I had before which led me to being in the ER one night cause it freaked me out. I've been having good luck with CBD bud.

I told this friend I thought it was weird and she told me her first though was she accidentally went into the wrong room and her church was somewhere else in the Temple. We both kinda got through it with the typical ""ancient ceremony so of course it's different"" mentality.  


Like others have said here I feel like the Temple prep program is a joke. They show you some pictures but otherwise prepare you in no way for what you are about to experience. Heck even if someone had told me it was gonna be weird I'd have appreciated the heads up.  


For me I've had a mixed relationship with it. I don't like going but I always appreciate the piece and quite of the experience but I've yet to really ever enjoy the experience itself. A lot of times my wife and I just do sealings because I enjoy those a lot more and you still get to go sit in the celestial room and have some quite time."

Unless I'm mistaken and not remembering something, the BoM says nothing about homosexuality. The Bible does but we also know that it has been altered and mistranslated and therefore could have the philosophies of men mingled with scripture.

latterdaysaints,fp6qspy,t1_fp65l0x,1588356986.0,the only downside to the bishops store house though is that you have to deal with leadership roulette. Some leaders are more compassionate than others. We've been in a bind before where a bishop asked why we don't just move if we can't afford to live where we do. My job can be very feast or famine and it was very stressful to be told that. Point is you aren't wrong as the church has helped members but sometimes it can be a battle to get that help unfortunately.

Take your time and do your research, there is no rush despite the church pushing asking for baptism commitments on first meetings years ago. I personally hated doing that on my mission and would have enjoyed teaching someone like you that is taking it slow. The church has a lot to offer but it is a life style commitment which for the most part isn't a bad thing. If it fits for you as a church then attend, just know that changing down the road can be a challenge as you will be on the records and get visits from missionaries and members every so often asking you to come back. :)"

latterdaysaints,fo0tvfu,t1_fo0it6e,1587419664.0,well the nice thing about symbolism when related to spiritual matters is it can mean that to you even if not what actually happened. I mean there's at least one person that thinks Covid-19 happened so their missionary could come home early. I think it's kinda like when you read a scripture or your blessing for the millionth time and it hits you differently because you make a connection with something going on in your life at that moment. The scripture may not even remotely relate to your situation but if what you got from it helps then it's no less real.

I had always just accepted that it was because the fullness of the gospel wasn't on the earth before but when you really look at it.. it raises some interesting questions like this. I mean.. there are countless civilizations that would never have been introduced to the gospel and we have ZERO records for them. Is it just busy work to be having us do something spiritual?

On one hand it's great that they are putting the facts out there, facts that were anti years ago but facts and out there non the less. On the other hand they do it as if it's always been the case.. I guess it's like we were taught in sunday school how you don't feel the thin threads until there are so many around you that you become bound.

I wonder the same thing about if others are like this, I'd say chances are good that there are some that do this.. However I've seen many people comment on this sub saying that only works for long before it wears on you or becomes too triggering. So all I can do is see how it goes.. I also feel it buys me more time to make decisions removing some of the stress/pressure involved with it. I can take my time to see where I fit and where my beliefs land.

Anyway, luckily we have this sub, it's my outlet and support group. I do want to be able to open up to some of my friends at church and be honest with them about where I am but I find a lot of members become defensive the moment you bring issues up. Maybe it's because they've already had doubts and it's their defenses kicking in. If you ever need to chat you can DM me and I'm sure anyone in this sub would say the same."
mormon,fnnxh97,t3_g2bii9,1587104802.0,"first breathe in and then let it out! and let all that worry and self punishment go with that exhale. The church, I believe, unintentionally creates a severe issues for members who continually punish themselves over not being good enough. They do this by saying it's simple and to do your best while also expecting unattainable levels of expectation and on top of this we burn ourselves out. I think burn out is when my crisis began. I'll spare you the details unless you want to talk about anything and just say that I am currently planning on just trying to attend as a unbelieving or nuanced member because like you I enjoy the community. While some member can be holier than thou I don't have anything against members and what they are trying to do because like me, they are just trying their hardest. Upper management is where I have my biggest modern gripes.. Anyways, I say go ahead and back yourselves off from it, attend it as a church and start to shed away whatever cultural aspects of it you don't like. If you want to follow Christ then follow him. If He's the living son of a loving God I'm pretty sure they care more about you having faith in that vs what church you go to.

sorry.. that got long. :P"
