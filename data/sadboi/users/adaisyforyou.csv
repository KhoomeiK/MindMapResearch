SuicideWatch,fp8qrv5,t3_gbrulo,1588399948.0,"Umm I can't stay asleep. Umm sometimes I get three hours, sometimes five or six or none at all. I tried to do cold turkey on caffine or using my phone too much for a few weeks felt that it made little to negligible difference to my sleep quality then gave up. The lack of sleep makes me irritable, miserable to be around and hard to concentrate at school/work. I had about 5 hours last night and I am feeling some what human today. Yeah the idea that death is like sleeping forever is appealing. By what if it isn't :/ what if I attempted and never succeed. What if I do succeed? What's next? The thought of what if just overwhelms me"

mentalhealth,f26ozej,t3_dc8hxi,1570019173.0,"Hey peachy angel,
I was once on seroquel many years back. I was on a relatively high dosage for depression, I think. I slept very well. A little too well. Oops, It made me sleep too much. It's good as a sleeping aid. I was on it for a few months and but switched out to another anti psychotic. Maybe because my doctor felt that it wasn't working out for me. But hey don't take my word for it. Keep trying. 2days is too short to tell if the meds is working. Give it minimum 2weeks or until your next review and let your doctor know how it makes you feel.  Don't give up darling. If you're feeling irritable or sleepy in the daytime. You could try taking a cold shower or washing your face and wiping yourself down with a cold cloth(if you find it hard to bring yourself to shower) . Take short naps(less than 30mins) if you can. When you can't sleep at night what helps me is listening to rain, water sounds at night. Or browsing illustrative megazines like Frankie or Flow. Books with lots of nice pictures and illustrations. I find it hard to read at night so I just look at the drawings or photos. I journal or scribble my worries if I'm feeling anxious. I hope this note finds you well. Take care💓"
