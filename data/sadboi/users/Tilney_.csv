bipolar,fhem4a1,t3_f2st97,1581525270.0,"I am in uni, got diagnosed a year ago.. for a while when I got back to uni I always felt like I don’t want to go and why do I have to go .. it seemed pointless but I did it nonetheless and scored high grades .. the feeling didn’t fade a way for a long time but it  eventually did.
First of all congratulations are in order 🥳🥳
My advice is ignore that voice and keep your routine.. you’re finally working full time which means you’re stable. I know bp makes life harder but it doesn’t make it less of a life. I say go to work and do your best .. try to keep yourself busy , sleep well and take your meds and all will eventually be well ... work will be an auto pilot thing in no time ❤️
Take care"
bipolar,fhekowl,t3_f2tab1,1581524432.0,Sorry but he’s very annoying.. you did nothing to apologize for .. he was clearly annoying you and to blame it on bipolar is a stretch!

bipolar,fgpmdj7,t1_fgncoro,1581007712.0,Couldn’t agree more on both points
bipolar,fglbdrc,t3_eyst55,1580889309.0,Try a different Dr and don’t think of leaving because it’s not something you can do.
bipolar,fglb5yg,t3_eytyoi,1580889035.0,When I was hospitalized I had a lot of side effects with my meds .. I had seizers At some point and tremors for a while . I think you should ask your psychiatrist to change your meds. My parents noticed other side effects later on like I would be very numb towards everything or just stare for a long time but every time the notice something I don’t which is helpful because we usually don’t.

bipolar,fgla39u,t3_ez2rha,1580887687.0,They increased my dose of lamictal gradually to avoid the rash. I am on 100 mg I didn’t feel what you’re describing... maybe you’re worried abuses the increase and you feel that way ?

bipolar,fgl9qxi,t1_fgl89dg,1580887268.0,Yeah you’re probably right. When I was manic I doubted everything and found motive in everything people do however straightforward they were being.
bipolar,fgl9nx3,t1_fgl9jp3,1580887166.0,"Nvm I just read the title. The first step is to get diagnosed and then once you’re medicated they will probably put you on mood stabilizers or something of the sort and your moods will level believe me, you don’t have to go through this alone, it’s good that you’re sober cuz the booze won’t solve anything it’ll just numb you and that’s not the solution."
bipolar,fgl9jp3,t3_ez5d23,1580887022.0,Have you been diagnosed too ? And if so are you medicated ?
bipolar,fgl9ekj,t1_fgjg0o9,1580886845.0,I hope you choose medication 🙏 it’ll be tough at first but you’ll be okay
bipolar,fgj40om,t1_fgiwb22,1580836564.0,"One of the meds I was on made me so zombified I couldn’t even open my eyes normally but slowly and gradually they gave me the right meds. Bipolar is very dangerous unmedicated especially when it’s causing you to harm yourself, you should rethink your decision. Every time you have recurring manic episodes it gets worse, be safe."

bipolar,fg7hood,t1_fg7fuff,1580592771.0,Thank god for the meds .. I have a friend who has bipolar and refuses to be on meds. I think it’s a process and we adjust ourselves over time .. of course you miss that energetic person you were but I think the alternative is a gloomy one where you constantly struggle to no end
bipolar,fg7hb7v,t1_fg7gk37,1580592511.0,Your analogy confirms what I realized that it all depends on observation.. I hope you always remain stable ❤️❤️
bipolar,fg7ew65,t3_excg1w,1580590824.0,I am on 100 mg Lamictal and 3mg Invega for a long while now and it affected my period too .. they are infrequent and when the do happen they only last for 3 days which is frustrating .. have you been gaining weight too ?
