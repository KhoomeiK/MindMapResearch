Not surprising at all. I was always told that my ""mysterious aura"" or some shit like that makes all the extroverts wanna talk to me. Something about seeming uninterested in people makes people interested in why you're not interested in people"

For example, I live with my very extroverted cousin and we'll hang out outside all day, and in the evening he'll still try to find people to hangout with while I go read or play a game. I still have time for people if they need me, but I *choose* to be by myself if I'm not needed"
Landlord,flhrp6w,t3_fosudo,1585168244.0,"Where I'm from, a landlord would be unable (by law) to enforce these terms even if you signed it. They're not even, technically, allowed to collect late fees (although a lot of places still try/do), let alone collect other outrageous ""fines"".

You should check the tenancy laws of your state *before* entering into a contract."

There was this one particular shot I air rolled into in order to make the angle, and it dawned on me that I was getting better at the game. Then over time I noticed that the majority of my shots involved at least a little bit of air roll. Then the other day I went up for this shot that required a relatively complicated air roll, and I hit the post, but I recorded the clip because, in the moment, I didnt really comprehend how I reacted the way I did.

So basically, yeah I agree it's all muscle memory and instinct"
