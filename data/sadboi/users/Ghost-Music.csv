I too had almost 40 hours for three weeks and would then have 12 for a week so they wouldn’t have to hire me full time and give me insurance. Then back to 40 for three more weeks. I was a ghost employee, meaning I did my job well and quietly and management never really knew I existed. Those I trained though got a bunch of rewards because they were extremely loud and flirted with the store manager. I didn’t mind because the customers liked me and so did my coworkers but when I would get a review saying I needed to do better and they hadn’t even been seeing me work, while I was doing the job of three people because the others suddenly quit or went to another department, but the ones I trained got rewarded for doing less work, that I helped with, it made me resentful. 

Anyway, a new manager was hired and went on a war path and started firing people in all departments because the management didn’t keep up with the point system and he found everyone who went over their points, didn’t matter the reason or how valid, and instead of warnings he was supposed to give out, he just fired them. People who had been there for years and were great employees. I quit the day they were going to fire me and I’d been there for 4 years. He didn’t know or care about anyone’s work ethic, he only cared that he could wield power."

To a kid it felt like a portal, my sister and I had to kind of grab the sides and jump through because our legs weren’t long enough to step over. The stairs scared me a little because they were steep and pretty much ladders, but the men on the ship were always helpful and encouraging and made sure I didn’t fall or anything.

We couldn’t leave the table until it was gone and this time we were bawling, we could just not eat it. So he added more. We got in trouble and cried for a few hours until he finally let us go to bed.
