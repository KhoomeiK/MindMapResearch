TwoXChromosomes,fp9gq1x,t1_fp9gjbt,1588425731.0,"Not OP but for me, it’s to celebrate my body. One day when I’m older, I can look back and see what a fox I was...even though I might not have always felt like it."
Rosacea,fhfb1xz,t1_fhezo05,1581539820.0,"Fuck that person, dude. I’m going through the same thing as you! My face looks totally fine 90% of the time but sometimes my neck starts turning red and blotchy and sometimes it spreads to my face, flushing bright red. I’m not even sure if it’s rosacea anymore but something else. Shoot me a message and I’ll PM you some things I use to keep it in check. I haven’t figured out how to stop it completely but I’ve managed to get it under control at least a little bit."
midcenturymodern,febulog,t1_fe6di3g,1578962899.0,I have absolutely zero idea!! Sorry!!

SubaruForester,f95axdd,t1_f94pyuy,1575123646.0,Thanks!! They’re all dying a slow death in NW Ohio. Honestly I’m really finicky about visibility and it hasn’t bothered me in the slightest! From the inside it’s pretty transparent. When I get a chance I’ll share a photo from the inside looking out!
SubaruForester,f93mchb,t1_f93m99l,1575062720.0,"I actually got the millennium falcon decal on amazon for pretty cheap, and the mountain range decal on Etsy...for not so cheap but definitely worth it!"
SubaruForester,f8rz326,t1_f8qzh30,1574760492.0,[here’s](https://etsy.me/2kltsm1) the link! Enjoy and please post pics when you get them!
SubaruForester,f8qfpyt,t1_f8qeo90,1574717021.0,"Oh, gotcha. I didn’t get it brand new so I guess it wouldn’t have worked anyway. Oh well. It’s a nice idea though. Thank you for getting me hip to it, maybe next time!"
SubaruForester,f8q6his,t1_f8q5h5h,1574712871.0,Never even heard of it! Seems pretty self-explanatory! I’d have to look at some pictures and see if it’s something I’d be into.
SubaruForester,f8exm1i,t1_f8exind,1574535281.0,I was thinking about getting some new tires for her. Thank you for being so helpful!!
SubaruForester,f8ewkw6,t1_f8ewhak,1574534878.0,Oh I am!! My old car (and first) was a 2004 cavalier so it’s really nice to get into something safe for winter!
SubaruForester,f8et5q8,t1_f7nffaq,1574533348.0,It’s 33k miles so I will definitely do that. Thank you!!!
SubaruForester,f7mnt86,t1_f7mlk86,1573868479.0,Thank you!! I’ve been wanting one for years now and finally got my shit together just enough to get one!! It’s been a long time coming and I’m super psyched about it. Hate having a car payment but I plan to pay it off fast.
Anxiety,f7cdq8e,t3_dv3h9d,1573590026.0,This actually took some weight off my chest and reminded me to stop fighting it so hard. Thank you for that!
AskReddit,f6cwyal,t3_dr0nmn,1572789327.0,I’ll go first: I put sugar and orange juice on my pancakes. (It’s a family thing.) Nobody else has ever heard of it. It’s delicious!
Rosacea,f6bgwv8,t1_f62ggbv,1572773575.0," No, my skin didn’t have a reaction but that’s a good idea for when I’m in a hurry! Thanks for the tip!"
weirdal,f5m2klc,t1_f5kxcgo,1572285863.0,I asked him how he could possibly drop the ball like that!! Glad I got to him when I did!
Rosacea,f5m1059,t3_dob9ws,1572285436.0,"Mine is pretty similar to yours! I got mine under control with horse paste, azaleic acid and the medicine my dermatologist prescribed. I don’t have the exact names right now but if you want to DM me, I can send them when I find out! I also wondered if mine is actually rosacea but every professional insists that it is."
SkincareAddiction,f4h3boj,t1_f4fw05q,1571587624.0,"I did! It’s definitely helping. My doctor also put me on an anti-depressant/anxiety med called Celexa which is doing wonders. My anxiety is at an all time low, but I still have my sense of self preservation. I’ve never felt better! My face is still flaring up but not nearly as bad as it was in the beginning!! I finally feel like there’s hope for me! Thank you sooo much!!"
SkincareAddiction,f3losdl,t1_f3lnru8,1570978122.0,"I actually just began meditating with the Headspace app to try and manage my anxiety! You’re right, it’s like I get slightly stressed and then it just snowballs because I’m fighting it so hard. I’ll be making an appointment with my doctor to see what she thinks because it’s been out of control lately. Thank you so much!! I’m gonna look into hydrating masks and maybe pamper myself today!"
SkincareAddiction,f3le4hp,t1_f3j0cjq,1570975052.0,Thank you so much!! I will check it out and see what works for me. It does make me feel a little better to know I’m not the only one. I appreciate you!!
SkincareAddiction,f3l3253,t1_f3jxxja,1570972061.0,Thank you!! I actually forgot to mention that I put on sunscreen before I do my makeup. My skin is definitely super sensitive to sunlight!

legaladvice,ex4fmi9,t1_ex42hvx,1566004019.0,Thank you! Waiting is a very good idea. I thought I had a time limit or something. I’ll make sure to keep track of time lost at work due to this and doctor’s appointments and whatnot. I appreciate your advice so much!
