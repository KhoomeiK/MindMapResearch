My friends pushed me into dating after me and him split I met my now bf a few weeks later - We had a great dating faze and then as things intensified I broke things off with him a few times because I was still dealing with alot of fallout from my previous relationship. I am very lucky that after the 2nd time I broke things off I reached out to him via text and he responded and gave me a 2nd chance 3rd chance even I guess lol that was almost 2 years ago and we are going strong.

That was my moment of HOLY FUCK this could be me and my journey began. It wasn't about my now ex bf at that time it was about ME and my health and my well being - she cant lose the weight because YOU want her to she has to WANT it for herself. 

I would skip ultimatums and guilt trips and advice because those can easily spiral or backfire I would just tell her straight I need a separation to get my stuff together because you've chosen an unhealthy lifestyle and I am no longer going to be pardon to it."

 I think it really depends on the person because I have a friend who squirts often she said but it wasn't until she met someone that had it happen randomly that she could do it.

1 reccomendation buy more than one so you can change them out  - also only put them in a washer by themselves or with things you dont mind smelling like piggies I have 2 big ones so that's a load of laundry for me.
