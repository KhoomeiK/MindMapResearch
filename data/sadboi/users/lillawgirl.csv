Also just a suggestion (pls don‚Äôt take offense) but maybe keeping an emergency fund would be very useful (a few extra months of rent, enough for food, utilities and gas) and just don‚Äôt touch it at all.

relationship_advice,f74ga5l,t1_f74f91v,1573401990.0,"Are you from another culture? My family are as well and there‚Äôs a strong preference for boys in our culture over girls for example, and that kind of thing is so difficult to overcome. 

This same situation also happened to my two cousins. The dad and his relatives loved the older son and ignored the younger boy. My aunt did make up for it by always encouraging him to do well in school and spent time with him, but nothing changed the dad‚Äôs behavior. Well that boy grew up to be a doctor and now, the entire other side of the family who ignored him is trying to be nice. So fake lol. This also caused a big rift between the brothers as they got older. 

The kid knows at least his mother loves him so do all you can to show J you love him and want the best for him too. No matter what though he will feel the pain of a father who doesn‚Äôt care. 

But If you really feel you can‚Äôt do anything about your husband‚Äôs behavior, I feel bad for you...you have to either confront him or see how he feels when you are mad about something/are less affectionate towards him...the fact that he doesn‚Äôt care about your concerns says a lot about him. He needs to start caring about how you feel. 

As the woman, you have a lot more power than you think, unless he‚Äôs really one of those abusive types in which you should leave"
relationship_advice,f74ep6k,t3_du7x8k,1573401387.0," ‚ÄúMy husband doesn‚Äôt like to be questioned‚Äù

Uh he sounds like a real authoritarian, and if I was in a relationship with a man like that I‚Äôd be like ‚Äúwell I don‚Äôt like my concerns dismissed.‚Äù 

I know how your son is feeling my dad blatantly and to this day favors my other siblings. While my mom tried to make it up to me by always showing me love, she didn‚Äôt ever say anything to him about trying to be nicer to me, but I don‚Äôt blame her bc she hates her marriage and doesn‚Äôt want to talk to him if she can avoid it. I forgave her.

But my dad? I mean, I don‚Äôt want him to die and be unhappy in life, but I have zero attachment to him as a father and could not care less about him, and now that I‚Äôm successful he keeps trying to be nice but nope I‚Äôm not having that."

Not as fancy as Ladue or Frontenac but you still have everything you need. Ballwin is also nice and slightly cheaper than Chesterfield. Wildwood is great.

I live right between Town and Country and Chestefield and it‚Äôs perfect. Plus you can find anything from apartments to small homes to big homes...

You go now, they will see it as a sign of weakness in their warped twisted minds. Don‚Äôt let them take anymore of your time until you get that respect. They took enough, your time, self esteem etc.

relationships,etqy9so,t1_etqtv35,1563106837.0,"I sympathize but at some point the pain outweighs the gain. Here, there‚Äôs more pain than benefit for you. Your mind is in survival mode trying to put a bandaid on the pain by justifying his actions. 

Step away from him and the situation to see clearly. What if this happened to your loved one, sister, or best friend? Would you want her to stay with that man? No right? 

Self-care means doing what is best for you. And he is NOT the best for you, I‚Äôm telling you. You have the strength to leave. Pay attention to how YOU feel, you‚Äôre the one whose world feels like it‚Äôs over right? you‚Äôre the one hurting. He‚Äôs not hurting. He doesn‚Äôt care about your happiness. He‚Äôs not going to care, ever, because in his mind, he doesn‚Äôt respect you.  No matter what words he speaks, his actions tell the whole story. 

So why should you think ‚ÄúI just want him to be happy?‚Äù Get angry! For yourself. For YOUR happiness. 

Get out, find a new place, empty your stuff, talk to a trusted friend. Maybe even your mom. Break up with him and send her the pictures of you two so she knows as well."
relationships,etqxe26,t3_cd0g71,1563105949.0,"Hey :) listen you‚Äôre not naive or stupid for wanting to love someone and expecting that back especially if you have been with him all this time. I know it hurts. I know it feels like you‚Äôll never get out of the hurt.

But you have to see that he doesn‚Äôt respect you. And if there‚Äôs no respect, what‚Äôs the point? No respect, no loyalty, no real love. And it won‚Äôt develop no matter what you try. I PROMISE YOU there‚Äôs more to this life than this shell of a relationship, there‚Äôs your dreams, your goals, your happiness, the moments you find joy, they aren‚Äôt all about this person.  No matter what you tell yourself. There‚Äôs a guy out there, somewhere, somehow, that will open your eyes to real love and this guy will be nothing compared to him. 

Walk away because you are choosing you now. You are giving yourself that dignity. You are starting a new chapter, and now you certainly won‚Äôt settle for less than you deserve; the love and care you poured into the relationship hasn‚Äôt been returned exactly the same right? It‚Äôs time to put all that love you have into yourself. There have been things over time that have made you feel pretty low right? Walk away. 

Give yourself that respect and you will find that you won‚Äôt tolerate when people behave this way to you anymore.

depression,es2g5rl,t3_c5j15l,1561523274.0,"You gotta believe and know that no one on this earth, no one, is inherently superior. Can they fly or do they have superpowers? They still have bodily functions, embarrassing moments, have cried their eyes out, etc. No one on this earth is better. Take them off that pedestal you put them on. 

The second you think someone is better because of money/looks/whatever, you‚Äôve lost man. Because you let your perception of them steal your self worth. You base your self worth on comparison. The trick is to first, accept your life as it is. Can‚Äôt accept it? Are unhappy? Then go make the changes you need to make. It will take time but we are works in progress not perfection. 

You can be sad that others are living a life you want, be jealous, or you can respect that they are out there living their life and learn from them.  I get it. I do. There‚Äôs people out there who it‚Äôs easy to think ‚ÄúI wish I was beautiful like her and had her job and was popular‚Äù but then I catch myself because I realize I‚Äôm happy with me. I got a lot going on for me to be grateful for. 

You need to be happy with yourself. Or find a way to make yourself happy.

Figure out what can you do now to get to where you want to be."
