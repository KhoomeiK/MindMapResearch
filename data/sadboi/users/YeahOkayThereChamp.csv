AmItheAsshole,fmzj8ri,t3_fy71c5,1586522082.0,"So this happened when I was a kid. In my case, my step brother was a total ass and would show off and brag. My Dad and Step mom DID do the whole 'This is a special gift from his Dad and thats why and everyone is different, etc' and that would have been fine if the turd didn't turd about it. Eventually, Step Mom and Dad told him if he was going to continue rubbing it in, the stuff could stay at his dads and eventually, it did. They were not forcing him to share, just asking him not to sashay through the livingroom and talk shit about how he had nice things and we didn't. 

I personally do not see anything wrong with things staying at his fathers. My x and I do this (at HIS insistence being that hes is able to afford things and I am not and thus, he thinks I shouldn't be allowed to have the kids those things here \*eyeroll\*) My kids understand that at moms we ride bikes and at dads we have electronics. My kids are good with the balance. Every family is different. 

So I say perhaps YTA for timing and the way you handled it but NTA because I personally do not think it is an unreasonable consideration."

AmItheAsshole,fm4mee7,t3_fsy823,1585756819.0,"I legit had THE EXACT SAME experience with my xMIL. She was furious that my mom was in the delivery room (mom wasnt supposed to be, it was a last minute change. xMIL had been present at her daughters childrens births, mom had never been to any of her grandkids expect my children) and threw a month long tantrum that my mom was with the baby and I. My mom lives across the country, xMIL lives 5 mins away. Even today, for my moms annual visit, xMIL will do all she can to bogart time with my kids during my moms visit. 

At first I was annoyed by xMIL. She still annoys me but for other reasons. The bandaid was to 'ask' her to do things with the kids. I ask, she says no (every single time) but being asked makes her feel important. Note: I know shes always going to say no so I do not really need her to do anything. Im just trying to give this crazy lady a win because my kids love her. Also, we've realized theres some dementia starting there. 

Ive come to accept that shes involved in a one sided competition with my mom (and now me since the divorce) and honestly, mom and I just laugh at her antics (not cruelly, swear) because its just who she is. She wants to feel involved and important.

Also, no. I barely wanted my xH watching the birth let alone my mom and certainly NOT my MIL. Ugh."
dating_advice,fm1id46,t3_fsed2j,1585678967.0,"Two kids, 7 and 9. Prior to my divorce from their father, the two kids and I bed shared. As they got older, they'd fall asleep in my bed and I would move them to their rooms. I was the only caregiver and this was the easiest way for me to get them both asleep at the same time each night. By the time the divorce rolled around, they were sleeping in their own beds and getting into mine around 4-5 am. Ive been living with my BF for a year, year and a a half. He absolutely hates kids in the bed and I agree with him. It puts him in a potentially bad situation. (My ex isn't above accusations. ) If my kids are climbing in the bed, it makes him uncomfortable. At their ages, its not really appropriate. So I walk them back to their beds cuddle for a minute, then go back to mine.

I will tell you, even as I was agreeing with him and transitioning the kids to their new beds, in my new apartment and this new normal, (like your childs new bedroom is a change) his aggressive stance on No Kids In the Bed was annoying. They are children and they are used to that love and comfort. Perhaps offer cuddles before bed or lay with her in her bed until she is almost asleep? There are ways to make this work without outright pushing her out."
BipolarReddit,fm1ggvn,t3_fsar7e,1585677972.0,"I was diagnosed as a teen and ignored until a bit ago. I WAS diagnosed with PPP after my first child was born. It was absolutely awful. While I was not hospitalized, I can clearly see now that I should have been. I  did have an OBGYN who was amazing and regularly checked in since I refused therapy (my abusive ex husband was very much against it and I was too much of a train-wreck to stand up for myself) I remember one thing she said about my hallucinations that helped: think of them as pregnancy nausea. You know it WILL stop and it WILL go away. Breathe through it. Idk if that will help you, or even if you have the hallucinations it, it really helped me. In retrospect, I regret not seeking more professional help and I am so very glad that you are.

My current therapist has told me PPP is very common with BP.   
I am so sincerely sorry that you are going through this. My son is 9 now and kind of awesome. 

I know that seems like a long ways away but things really do get better."

My anxiety is mostly gone. I didn't realize most of the 'good' things I do (clean my apt every day before work. Work out. Eat right.) are fueled by anxiety (ED recovery and the fear I will die before coming home and my family will find a messy apt.) I have no 'sparkle' anymore. I am no longer the life of the party.

BipolarReddit,flxmzvr,t3_frkrsa,1585586026.0,"I was diagnosed as a teen and then completely ignored it until my late 30's. I suspected it when I wasn't using birth control and was tracking my cycle and noticed that I was having...massive problems? On a pretty regular schedule. I kept thinking it was linked with my cycle. It really hit home when I started back to work after being a SAHM for a million years and I was dismissed, seemingly without reason from two jobs within 8-10 months. Nothing negative in my file, just 'this isn't working out'. The second dismissal, I took a hard look at myself and my behaviors and started therapy. Realized I've never really held a job longer than a year. Honest, brutal therapy. I brought all of my cycle tracking, my google calendar of events (I fixate on dates, times, events) and laid it all out and my super awesome therapist said, 'So, have you heard of BP?' and it was being kicked in the face. Looking back at some life events and rather outrageous and impulsive life choices and yeah, I can easily see the mania. Depression is harder for me to see, but, it is there. I did the GeneSite testing and have started meds and...its helping. A lot."

AmItheAsshole,flg9az5,t1_flfhlis,1585135746.0,"My favorite part about those types of parents is how much they bitch about having to help their kids all the time. How much time they have to give to them. How much they have to do for them. My friend is 100% like this. Waits on her daughter all day, each day. Kid calls from school office, asking mom to bring her fast food for lunch because she doesn't like what mom packed. Mom leaves work to do so. Then bitches on FB about having to bring daughter lunch. Like, wtf? No. Justifies it by saying 'I want her to know she can always call me and depend on me! Ill always be there! Ill always answer!' (direct quote) Its fascinating to watch.

Shes creating a problem for herself and her daughter later by not encouraging her daughter to be independent and self sufficient.

But, as someone who is dating a man with no kids, you have to be careful about how you blend in. You guys have to discuss how you want to raise up the kid and how you are going to work together on that. For us, if we disagree on what is happening, we call it out 'Can I speak to you in the other room?' and discuss who and how is going to deal with it BEFORE going to the child. He was raised up more like you were and I was raised by wolves. So, we are finding a middle ground. Its difficult."

AskReddit,flf1u30,t3_ex1qz2,1585096167.0,"I liked the attention. I was much younger. I had some self esteem issues. Body image issues. I am also recently diagnosed as Bipolar so, Hey-o.

Every relationship I have been in since the one I cheated in, I have been cheated on. 

I have since recovered from my self esteem/body image issues and have come to respect myself too much to every put myself back in that place. 

But, back in the day, if a man complimented me. Or gave me attention. Flattery. Even if he knew I was in a relationship, it made me feel special. Now I realize if he knows a girl is in a relationship and is still pursuing her, he likely just thinks shes easy. What they do with you they do to you and all.

It is very easy to cheat. Texting, social media, flattery, validation. It is very easy to think pretty words have good intentions. If someone is offering you something you think you lack, I think it is natural to want to take it. Its much harder to ask your partner to put in some work. Or, even to figure out what you think you are lacking. Or, to realize perhaps you aren't in the right relationship. Being mature/responsible/respectful is hard; it is much easier to cheat. 

Except its not, The thing is, for me, cheating cost too much. I hated the way I felt lying and hiding and being afraid to get caught. Its nerve wracking and requires far more effort that the sex and conversations are worth. Also, I have never, every had sex that was worth losing my whole damn way of life over. 

And I am old. And kind of freaky. So."
Divorce,flbah00,t3_fj9n3e,1585000667.0,"Its possible you're only seeing a facade. You describe your wife exactly as I have been described by darn near all of my ex's (so the jealous type, emotionally detached, never wanting to look back) I am either ALL IN or TOTALLY OUT.

I chose not to allow him to see any sign of that hurt because I learned a long time ago that if I show that, it seems to be viewed as an opportunity to reconcile. Which it is not. I was finally tired of the wash, rinse, repeat of 'trying'. Also, I do not think it is appropriate to help each other through the emotions of divorce. 

When we see each other now I am not the life of the party but I am pleasant and in general good cheer. He views this as me not caring at all about our previous life together and that is not it at all. I just chose not to wallow in what could have been."

He had a major issue with our height. To the point where he would get upset if I wore anything other than flats. Literally, would not stand next to me in pictures or stood if I was sitting, whatever. Ask me to change outfits until I put on one that worked with flats. Wore lifts in his shoes. It bothered him. Our height didn't bother me.

What bothered me was how often he would bring it up. (Constantly) And his ridiculous insecurity over it was one of the reasons I was not upset to drop him.

I am currently dating a man my height. He has zero issue with it and stands all cocky next to me when I am towering over him in my stilettos."

Its not great.

The only time I DID NOT do it was when I was dating multiple people. I wasn't sleeping with any of them, just dating. So I would...spread the obsessiveness. When I felt like I was pushing too much, Id push up on a another. For me, it wasn't ideal. Hard to maintain long term and, I realized I was just using people for entertainment/distraction. I didn't like the way that felt...and then suddenly, I wasn't interested in any of them.   
Its a bit of a cycle for me.
