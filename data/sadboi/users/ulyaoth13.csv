ffxiv,flb0va6,t1_flaymdz,1584995076.0,"I finished the msq when shadowbringers got released and in the following time after it. All jobs were at level 70 except for pld and war. I just took it 1 at the time, alternating between like ranged, magic style, melee, heals and tank so I had a different playstyle. Did mostly roulettes and daily pixies/beast tribe. When I got burned out or not having fun I decided not to play at all. Only played and did the roulettes if I enjoyed them

I hope that helps and good luck on your journey!"

I constantly worry and fear that I am not good enough and even though I am not suicidal, it does pass my mind from time to time. I would not act on it, but it seems so much easier then the difficult road I am taking with all the constant worries and fears.

I haven't read all the reactions, but it's a wonderful, heartwarming and heartbreaking thread."

AskReddit,f8dx3hc,t3_e07nci,1574512426.0,"Was on a week long school trip to Budapest. Around 17 year old. I was grumpy, not looking forward too it. My 'friends' decided to drop me the second day. Ignoring me at breakfast, not caring if I fall behind. Eventually I caved and sat down crying. One of them had some empathy left and tried to connect.

The rest of the week I was pretty much alone. It was aweful, it damaged me a lot. Even know. I was already someone that worried a lot about friendship and overthinking it all, how I can not havs friend, aint likeable. This trip was a moment that confirmed all those views. The subsequent year of highschool I spend alone. Walling myself off, not making friends and not trying to contact or react to any form of someone trying to approach that. I took that through the follow up study and into the place I work. I am now 36 years old. So, I went all that time w/o any friends, playing Wow and not doing the stuffs teens are suppose to do.

Only now have I finally nade a true friend for the past 3 years, because he ignored all my defense mechanicsm and I worry about it dialy. How he will too drop me, how I am not someone to hang out with.

Yes, I am seeing a psychologist about it all. Had a session of EMDR about this event. Could never speak about it w/o crying."

offmychest,f2mwbul,t1_f2mstog,1570309270.0,"The thought has crossed my mind, but I haven't commited or taken action on it. It would most likely single me out, making me feel even more isolated and alone. As I have no SO, few friends and some close co-workers. And even with my best friend I feel like a nuisance, burden and cant ask too much of him, despite the friend being there for me for the past 4 years. There is no contact with mu uncle/aunt and cousins ( guess who saw to that)

I would have to think about what my dad would like. Being semi indoctrinated by my mom/his wife."
