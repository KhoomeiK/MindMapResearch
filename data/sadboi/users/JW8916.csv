I've been having issues since I practically had to force myself out of my house to live with my brother to keep my parents safe since I work in a target. It's only a temporary move but it definitely does not help me very much. No matter how toxic my mom can be, I miss having my sister around and especially the 3 puppies around the house, even if they were super annoying."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,ffceq7b,t1_ffc1okh,1579797873.0,"No release date yet, but multiple stores outside of the US have written the release date to be the 29th of May before having it changed to ""coming soon.""

Xenoblade_Chronicles,ff1l3fv,t1_ff1czjb,1579480925.0,"Fair point but DE is slated for this year, this might be a lot of people's first time seeing the full story and it's a little frustrating how many crucial plot points are spoiled in smash"

Xenoblade_Chronicles,f7l5tol,t1_f7krpbd,1573833293.0,"I would say yes, but I'm a guy who bought the special edition and I really like putting my special editions in display, meaning I leave the steel book on display with the rest of the package meanwhile theres a gap in my shelf for the game"

SonicTheHedgehog,ey1mz8i,t3_cuwhjn,1566704249.0,The game is alright. The only issue is that if you don't like motion controls you might not be a fan. Go in with an open mind that this is a Nintendo wii game with wonky motion controls

That was a conversation that went of for an hour until she finally understood what programming and hacking are
