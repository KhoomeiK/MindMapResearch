I'm not sure if this is what's your thinking about, but I'm starting to guess that when you say 'looking' at the keys you're talking about watching the edge of the key depress compared to the rest.  If that's the case, yeah, your hands might block that motion, but if you look at the keyboard, you can still see what notes you're playing"

piano,fr1ep7n,t1_fr17f2u,1589818414.0,"Sometimes it's not that noticeable, sometimes it's sticking out. The goal is for it to be correct every time.  If you take a look at the very beginning, when your hands are set up and ready to go, you could actually curve them more.  Think about typing on a keyboard- if your fingers aren't curved enough, your thumbs aren't going to reach the spacebar.  Same here, if you don't curve them enough, have to force your hands into more awkward positions (thus causing your fingers to flatten) to reach the keys.   Try this- set your hands on the keys (just lightly rest them), keep your fingertips at the correct position but move your wrist up and forward a little.  Keep your arms relaxed.   
 See if that's more comfortable (It's super hard explaining with words and no visual, so if you try and it feels awkward I probably didn't explain well.  Look up videos of pros playing to get a better sense)"

Slack has a greater capacity for file sharing, and because you can start threads to directly reply to comments, it can be a lot easier to manage conversations if a lot of people are trying to share their input (we all know how hectic big group chats can be)  
Discord is a lot easier to share invite links- create an invite link, send it out, and boom.  Don't even need to download the app if you don't want it.  It's far better for voice and video chat, and they recently upped the limit of people in a video call to 25 for the pandemic.

How much of this buffer my engineering friends felt they had really depended on what they already knew and what they were used to, but if you did well enough to feel like you could fit in a school like RPI, chances are you'll find your way somehow. How much you will like a school will likely matter less on the sheer amount of time you spend studying and more on how you spend the rest of your time.  Everyone I know who was content with their experience generally had a supportive group of friends and made the time to do what they really wanted to do (even if that meant a little lost sleep).    
My advice: Make sure you're okay with a co-op program.  One may compare it to Northeastern's successful co-op, but it's only the same in concept.  Northeastern's program extends the degree completion to 5 years, whereas RPI makes it mandatory and still have students finish the degree in 4 years, which can really burn out students.  Some have to do four semesters in a row (fall, spring, summer, fall, and then co-op in spring)."
