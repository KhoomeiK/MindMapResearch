I plan to be honest to my son about it and just hope and pray he won't do the same. I feel pretty selfish as well. I stopped for so long and since he was born I have done more damage than I ever have. Went inpatient twice this year and still continue to do it. I feel like I'm only alive because of my son. Then there's the fear of your own kid being embarrassed of you and thinking you're crazy. Lifelong regret
bipolar,fmt80fl,t3_fx509d,1586368334.0,I have been a long time smoker. Not all the time but frequent. My psychiatrist is fully aware and doesn't mind it. I struggle with rage a lot and falling asleep/staying asleep. It helps immensely with both of those things and imo its better than taking more medications with much worse side effects than weed does. It's a very personal thing. Try not smoking for a month and see if you feel better without it. If you can't even go a month without it...you should most definitely stop using.

bipolar,fmr5hk4,t1_fmr479o,1586314341.0,Doesn't always have to be on purpose. I took 2 hits of acid which is a pretty normal dose right but I was so messed up I couldn't feel myself breathing.

SelfHarmScars,fmr44ep,t3_fwt80t,1586313439.0,I know how it is. I was clean for 5 years and then went to town with a scalpel on my legs. Then started destroying my arm. Those 6 years are still progress.

bipolar,fmmuy7u,t1_fmmtvve,1586212575.0,Well lamictal helps with more than just depression and just because you're smart doesn't mean you know everything(don't mean that as a jab at you). Just saying it's worth hanging in there. You may just be over analyzing it and looking for any rhyme or reason for how you're feeling atm.
selfharm,fmmu75g,t3_fw75dr,1586212164.0,My dr and therapist never really brought any of that up. I just said i had been doing it for around 13 years and it was left at that. They just requested that I was honest with them and that I would reach out if it turned into a really serious situation like wanting to kill myself or do it bad enough to NEED to go to the hospital. I think they do it to build trust not because they don't care how bad it is.
