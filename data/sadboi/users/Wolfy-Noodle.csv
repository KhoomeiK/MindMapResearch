1. Hugs. Ask your friend if they are comfortable with you giving them hugs, and if they are, go for it. They do help. 

2. This one might seem simple, but ask them how they are doing. Make it genuine, not just saying “how are you doing?” to be polite. Out of nowhere, ask them how they are. No one asks how I’m doing, and I wish people did. 

3. Let them know they can lean on you, cry on your shoulder. 

4. Don’t just say that you’re there for them, show it. Go out of your way to be there. 

Hope this helps, and good luck to your friend. Hope they stay strong"

Now, I can’t speak from experience myself, but I’ve heard people say that their entity in question started out very negative, but they changed. They became a better person once they realized they had people to help them. 

I’ve had similar negative thoughts recently, and I’ve thought about talking to it, making it into whatever, and helping it change. I’m not too sure about it, but if I were you, I wouldn’t worry too much about it. Hope this helped!"
