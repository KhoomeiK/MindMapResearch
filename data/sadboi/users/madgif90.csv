offmychest,fofyu4i,t3_g6zilv,1587745202.0,"Been in a similar situation before with an ex. He didn’t like having more than ~5 magnets on the fridge (who tf grows up in a household without a magnet-covered fridge?). He organized to an OCD level where he’d separate boxed baking products from bagged baking products, so bagged flour wouldn’t be with cake mix for example. My small crafty space was in one corner of the apartment while everything else was his. 

He never forced me to tell him when I was coming home, and I was definitely allowed to come and go as I pleased, however I was expected to tell him when I’d be back and how long I’d be gone for. When I’d spend time with my sister and talked to her about us, it got so bad that I had him write down what I should tell her about how we were doing and was supposed to report back to him what she said. He wanted us/him to look perfect to everyone else. 

We had conversation cycles that would just go around and around leading to absolutely nowhere because I’d always find loopholes in what he said. 

He was an emotional drain on me. He needed to be touching to feel like we spent time together. I once tried to do a hobby on the coffee table while he sat behind me on the couch (this never happened before because we’d always cuddle or game and cuddle) and within about 30 seconds he LITERALLY stuck his toes up my nose to “goof around”. (After this incident my therapist compared him to her 5-10 year old godson). 

We both had different work schedules and different weekends and he kept nagging me to get mine changed so we’d have whole weekends together (thank god that never happened or he’d have annoyed me even more). On that note, I’d have to go to sleep around 8 or 9pm to wake up at 4:30am and he’d take an hour out of that time to horseplay by only giving me a sliver of the edge of the bed to sleep on then tell me I could come back over. When I did then he’d use his feet to push me back over there and say “nope, that’s where you’re sleeping. Night night.” Sometimes he’d push me on the floor with his feet and pretend to go to sleep then tell me I could come back into bed only to push me off all over again. [Edit: he did all this while grinning and laughing like a child. Not that it really makes a difference.] This whole “game” happened EVERY NIGHT for months on end. 

There’s more but you get the point. He was nEeDyYYYYYYYY

EDIT: once I moved out I covered my fridge in magnets and obsessed over my hobbies I didn’t have time for with him. It felt so good!!!"

TooAfraidToAsk,finpwuc,t3_f8qeam,1582567979.0,"Long-ish post ahead! (But it gets my point across)

As someone (30) who’s been diagnosed with a few developmental disorders as well as anxiety, and someone who naturally processes at a slower pace, I’ve had to really come to terms with the fact that I enjoy a very simple life and may never become something as incredible as a doctor which is what my sister (25) will be going to medical school for in August this year. 

She enjoys traveling to visit our widespread family and her friends. I can easily see her joining Doctors Without Borders. She does want a family and to be married at some point but she’s a very ambitious and positive person who wants to enjoy life in ways that make her happy, and she’s been doing that for years. 

My sister and I have very close family friends raised by ambitious parents (they’re like cousins, aunts and uncles to us). One of the parents  happens to be the guy who created the very software which was sold to Target and is used on their handheld devices. He’s just a very smart and hardworking man. Same for my sister. Same for the rest of our family friends. 

For me, I want the “traditional” lifestyle for my future; go to work and socialize there, volunteer or spend time with a husband and friends during my time off; come home to a husband and relax with him. I used to think that being raised by a strict and pretty controlling single mom was why I wanted a simple lifestyle; I thought I wanted control over my life and a smaller, simpler life was the easiest way. Now I know I just handle simpler things better. I’ve tried to be more like my sister and I get too stressed and don’t really have fun and enjoy myself along the way. Regardless of how my brain functions, I just enjoy simple things. 

Take care of YOU! 💕"

BPD,ffhi507,t3_etldus,1579936292.0,"It’s amazing that you’re facing what sounds like a very complex and challenging issue. 

I totally understand what you mean about FEELING vs SHOWING. I was formerly diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression, aspergers, and borderline personality disorder and only recently went through DBT, after which I was re-diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, moderate; ADHD combined type (whatever that means); social communication disorder (hey there, aspergers!); bpd; and suicidal thoughts. 

I’ve only ever been able to be sympathetic (empathetic?) with a grain of salt. It’s like I get the concept but I don’t really understand until I’ve experienced it myself. Once I have then I’ve GOT it. I don’t always feel emotions to the extremity that other BPDs do but I definitely feel it strong enough to learn from it. 

Is any of this familiar to you too?

I’m really trying to give perspective and my own experience and separate the stigma I myself associate with NPD. On that note, I do want to say that there’s a terrible stigma with BPD that we are manipulative and selfish and “the really really bad” narcissistic, and NONE of that is true. A few hours ago I googled borderline personality disorder and the bottom of the results page showed related symptoms which basically all share symptoms of manipulation and I had to close that page out because ITS SO NOT TRUE and hurts so much to hear those things.
