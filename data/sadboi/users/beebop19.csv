TheBluePill,f0prfm7,t1_f0of92a,1568844775.0,"That’s an interesting take, considering the ones i’ve encountered hate Judith Butler and other queer feminist philosophers. But I see what you’re saying, and it’s certainly an argument Butler has had to respond to in the past (i.e. is her philosophy tacitly transphobic)."

BipolarReddit,f0njqak,t3_d5ozyt,1568771893.0,"Yeah they call it cognitive slowness. I got it from a high dose of abilify, but after they moved the dose down a notch it went away. Perhaps you could go on a slightly lower dose of meds? I know that can be impossible tho. Another thing my psych told me was that oftentimes cognitive slowness will fade over time. So that could give you some hope, maybe? Sorry, I know I felt hopeless when I had at it. It's very difficult and honestly kind of scary. Good luck to you, and I hope things get better!"

TheBluePill,f0n7q0u,t1_f0mifi6,1568762772.0,"TERFs, if anything, have a modernist critique of gender -- their conception of sex is based purely on scientific paradigms. They're perpetually stuck in the 70s ideologically lol. So I'm a bit confused by your comment."
BipolarReddit,f0g7w3x,t3_d4sjsq,1568595057.0,Go see a psychologist/therapist or psychiatrist. That's the only way. Self-diagnosis is a dangerous game.
BipolarReddit,f0g7pz2,t1_f0g6x0j,1568594984.0,"Weird. My worst ones are largely in the winter, I'm typically depressed in the summer. Funny how things vary like that; our disorder is so complex and weird lol."
BipolarReddit,f0g7i49,t3_d4rhvu,1568594898.0,"For me, it's almost always winter. I've had one summer long mixed/rapid cycling (not sure which) episode a few years ago, though. Isn't it strange how our minds are on some kind of bizarre genetically induced alarm clock? Like what the fuck causes that, since it's different for everyone and doesn't seem to be induced purely seasonally (like SAD) or something. Bipolar disorder is so odd. 

Btw, glad your episode isn't so bad this time. That's always a blessing. Hope it stays that way :)"

BipolarReddit,ez5cx3c,t3_d01c79,1567698161.0,"I do this too. It’s a bizarre compulsion, and tbh i don’t really know why I do it. I am vaguely afraid of / dislike sleeping though, which is certainly a component. But the key here is TAKE YOUR MEDS. No matter how late it is, even if you feel you’ve missed your typical time slot, take em anyway. It can be hard tho so i feel you, the whole damn sleep debacle can be really rough."

BipolarReddit,ey5u4ui,t3_cvoznt,1566840387.0,"I take 1200mg a day currently. I've been up to 2400, and past 1800mg there are VERY noticeable side effects, at least for me. I was basically high off of it every day for almost 6 months until I finally convinced the doc to lower the dosage. Unfortunately, I do feel like I've become dependent on it to sleep... 

In general it sort of works as a medication, but I have to be taking 1800+mg of it a day for there to be any noticeable reduction in anxiety, and as I said this is the threshhold dose for side effects. I'm honestly not clear if I really ""like"" gabapentin or not, or even what I think about its efficacy."
BipolarReddit,exq8z13,t3_cthpj8,1566499389.0,"Make sure that no matter what schedule you keep in college, you take your meds at the correct intervals. Even if you pull all nighters etc keep on your meds. Seriously -- I started taking lithium at too wide of intervals due to weird college scheduling and had a manic episode causing me to withdraw. 

Also, make sure that you're regularly checking in with someone and don't miss appointments for any reason. You have to be a real hardass with yourself with this stuff, imo

good luck! :)"
BipolarReddit,evpyg66,t3_ckp21e,1564682679.0,"This is only sort of similar, but once while I was manic the back of my neck/spine heated up to what felt like an insane temperature. When I went to the hospital I was nearly tested for meningitis, and they couldn't figure out what was wrong with me. I can't remember exactly what I later searched for, but apparently mania can cause heat in your spine or brain stem or something. Sorry this wasn't more helpful."
Arkansas,evlsu0i,t1_evlksuj,1564598769.0,So you feel that seeking asylum is a crime? That's....interesting.
BipolarReddit,ev20j8p,t3_ci3exf,1564168341.0,"900mg/day of lithium, and I drink a TON of water. It's easy to remember because the dry mouth from lithium makes me thirsty constantly. When I was at 1200 I was literally thirsty constantly, like as thirsty as you get walking through a desert. It was awful haha

But anyway, in my personal experience you can drink water intuitively and it'll be enough."
