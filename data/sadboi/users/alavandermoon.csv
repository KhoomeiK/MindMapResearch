prozac,f2fcup1,t1_f2ex2d5,1570215295.0,"Just try it. I thought I was going to be like when you drink a lot of coffee or super sleepy, but it’s different, it’s like your regular life but with a more positive view on the things that happen to you, I‘m able to see the future with hope and feel I have more clarity, this energizes me per se, but I don’t feel a crazy wave of energy. Also I feel lethargic but not sleepy or tired, just like... calmed. 

I’m loosing weight but I noticed this was because I used to eat out of stress, now I eat only when I’m hungry and had been naturally following a healthier diet, so the fact I look skinnier gained me more confidence.

And recently a guy posted a video here sharing his experience on Prozac and he said he used to smoke a lot of pot and drink alcohol and now he still does it but way less than he used to, he doesn’t feel he needs it as much now."

prozac,f2evsji,t3_dd8tka,1570204911.0,I’ve been depressed for a while and always refused to try antidepressants kind of for the same concerns you have and now that I’ve been in it for a month and the symptoms went away (My insomnia actually disappeared right away) I can’t help but think this was the answer to most of my problems and it was as easy as just trying it. I’m still going to therapy and eventually will stop taking the meds according to my psychiatrist.
prozac,f2evcz4,t3_dd94h3,1570204677.0,I’m on 20 mg and never had those symptoms so I don’t have an answer rather another question... why would a dose be increased? How your doctor determines it needs to be increased?

I thought “I’m just sad, it will pass” or “I’m just going through a rough time, it’s life” or “I’m hypersensitive”, insomnia, panicking attacks, lack of energy (which I would think it was just me being lazy)... everything was pointing I was depressed, I just didn’t acknowledged it. 

My life is completely different now, way better, Prozac saved me and I took it for granted for so many years refusing to take any meds, thinking “it is normal to be sad sometimes”."

Ayahuasca,f1qfoen,t1_f1q111l,1569699840.0,"They are shamans but that’s the way they call them in their communities so the fact they’re called “abuelo” or “abuela” mean they have the approval of a whole community that this person is an spiritual guider. 

I haven’t gone to Colombia yet but I’ve been in Ciudad Juarez down to the El Paso border with a group that brings abuelxs all the way from Colombia, it’s called Medicina Ancestral Ciudad Juarez and they have a FB page.

Empaths,f1kuc5m,t3_d9mt4x,1569540669.0,"I’m the same right now. It apparently is allergies and I never had allergies but did a lot of somatic work yesterday and the day before.

I would just say: go along with it. Your body is fixing emotions and it needs this purge. 

Take good care of yourself, drink teas and try to keep yourself grounded. Meditation may help as well."

It sounds like you communicate with animals. If you keep developing your gift you may become an animal medium, a person who helps animals to transition to the other side and also a person who can get grieving ex-pet owners to talk to their deceased pets and get comfort."

I second this. I am taking meds and even though I was already having issues with my husband, now I am able to tell him exactly how I feel in stead of holding it because I was scared of hurt him or make him mad. I’m less emotional than before but more honest."
prozac,f1jgfra,t3_d9n8qw,1569522910.0,I’m in week 4 and feel exactly like that. Less emotional and even joyful but way more tired ☹️

I was just watching “The Last Czars” on Netflix and there’s an episode where the youngest kid is hopelessly sick so the queen calls on Rasputin to help healingl him. Eeverybody thought it was miraculous that Rasputin had a calming effect in the child and with that he was able to stop his pain and the bleeding and improve his health, but the historian explain the logic behind those “miracles”: what really happened is that Rasputin had a calming effect in the mother who was very superstitious and believed blindly in Rasputin, he was like a therapist to her, so getting the mother to calm down and feel secure would automatically get the child calmed as well. 

Interesting..."

To answer to your question: it’s up to you! Each tarot reader has its own rituals and ways of doing it. I usually just make a template and I throw the sufficient cards to fill the template after shuffling and letting the person touch the desk with their thumb and middle finger and repeating some words with me (their name and a greeting for the Tarot). I read from there and if there are questions or things that those cards are not telling me, I drop a card or a few cards next to the one that produces the question. I can also throw another set of cards on top of the ones that are already there (after reading those of course) and keep following the same template until the time of the session is covered."

Sometimes when we’re in true need of something (money, emotional support, approval) we are motivated and pushed by it to make things happen, but in you’re case the 9 of pentacles is saying you’re too comfortable where you are and that’s preventing you from growing even more (because you already have a lot, which is actually good and nice but your soul is craving for a change)."

Or you could just go the music store, ask to borrow a guitar and play with it, if you like it you can get one second handed, or you can even meet someone in there who can participate in your project (my bf and I always meet people at the Guitar Center shop, he has a home studio and had recorded people he met there)."

That organization bring abuelas from Colombia every few months or so to guide the ceremony, and they have their own shamans to guide ceremonies once per month, look on FB for “Ayahuasca Chihuahua”. Very recommended.

I’m sure there are plenty of retreats in South Mexico too if you google it. I did mushrooms in Oaxaca and was such an experience but I just got lucky to meet the right people at a hostal, we spent the mushrooms trip in the woods with no spiritual guide, still it was very spiritual for us.

Also, there are ways of getting into a Peyote ceremony in the Wirikuta dessert or Real de Catorce (in central Mexico) with a Huichol priest, I want to do that one but I’m not sure how safe is that area right now due to drug cartel frictions :("
