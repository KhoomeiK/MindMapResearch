Also I feel lethargic but not sleepy or tired, just like... calmed. 

I‚Äôm loosing weight but I noticed this was because I used to eat out of stress, now I eat only when I‚Äôm hungry and had been naturally following a healthier diet, so the fact I look skinnier gained me more confidence.

I usually just make a template and I throw the sufficient cards to fill the template after shuffling and letting the person touch the desk with their thumb and middle finger and repeating some words with me (their name and a greeting for the Tarot). I read from there and if there are questions or things that those cards are not telling me, I drop a card or a few cards next to the one that produces the question.

Sometimes when we‚Äôre in true need of something (money, emotional support, approval) we are motivated and pushed by it to make things happen, but in you‚Äôre case the 9 of pentacles is saying you‚Äôre too comfortable where you are and that‚Äôs preventing you from growing even more (because you already have a lot, which is actually good and nice but your soul is craving for a change)."

That organization bring abuelas from Colombia every few months or so to guide the ceremony, and they have their own shamans to guide ceremonies once per month, look on FB for ‚ÄúAyahuasca Chihuahua‚Äù. Very recommended.

I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of retreats in South Mexico too if you google it. I did mushrooms in Oaxaca and was such an experience but I just got lucky to meet the right people at a hostal, we spent the mushrooms trip in the woods with no spiritual guide, still it was very spiritual for us.

Also, there are ways of getting into a Peyote ceremony in the Wirikuta dessert or Real de Catorce (in central Mexico) with a Huichol priest, I want to do that one but I‚Äôm not sure how safe is that area right now due to drug cartel frictions :("
