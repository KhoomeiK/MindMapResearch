I have other sexual traumas from both before and during, so it’s hard to determine exactly how much it affected me, but I fear sex and haven’t had it in years, which means I haven’t had a relationship in years. Part of the issue was that the sex between us was vaginally painful for most of the relationship and I relented knowing it would hurt. So was either drunk when I decided to do it or took shots beforehand, which didn’t really help—I conditioned myself to expect pain. That makes it harder now. I had a sexual fling with someone right after the relationship and had to be completely wasted out of my mind for it, which wasn’t safe, and now I don’t drink. (But I do want to have sex; it’s more of a PTSD-panic thing that deters me from seeking it out.) Then there’s the fact that meeting someone in high school and spending all your 20s with them means you never really learn how to date as an adult. I’m 35 now and have never had a healthy relationship and don’t even know what that would look like. Abusers and I seem to gravitate towards each other.
