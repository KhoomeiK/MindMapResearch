If you really eat 1000 cal a day, you will just be tired and try to move as little as possible, so your body would naturally burn less calories on an average day. You will sleep more, spend more time in bed etc. But it doesn't mean that this slowdown in metabolism will compensate for this huge calorie deficit."

Maybe your diet lacks salt? So all the water you drink doesn't stay in your body, and you always want to drink more.

I just wanted to write a word of caution about your calorie intake. I am not sure how you feel when eating so little, but I think I would be constantly hungry (and I am female shorter than you). I've lost around 8 kilos till I got to my lowest weight when I was restricting myself as much as you do (I was 18 at the time). It felt great, and I remember realizing ""I'm actually not fat anymore, and the love handles are gone"". What came next was not so great though - when you are in the state of constant calorie deficit for a long time your brain starts acting weird and it makes you hungry as hell, to a point where you don't feel full no matter how much you eat. Most people cannot resist this urge to eat in large quantities without being able to stop, and regain all the weight they lost. I'm not saying that this will happen to you, I just hope that you listen to your body when you restrict calorie intake, especially if you feel hungry all the time and find yourself constantly thinking about food."

changemyview,fni620r,t3_g1uxds,1586974593.0,"Wow there is a lot to unpack

1. If you can make $100 on every trade you make while trading every 10 minutes - you don't need to have your own money. People would be desperate to give you their money so that you can manage it for them. You would get paid for your skill to trade, not for the fact that you have money to invest.

2. High-frequency trading is a bit of a grey area in terms of its impact on the market (some studies show that it increases liquidity of the market, others show that it increases the trading costs immensely). Algorithmic trading however - I see nothing wrong with it. Any technology to some extent makes work of people more efficient, which is unfair to people who don't use the technology. Should we then ban all technology that automates work of people?

3. Buying back shares is almost equivalent to paying dividend, it's just more tax efficient, that's why a lot of companies do it instead of paying dividends.

4. After dividend payout the price of a share drops by the amount of the dividend. So if you decide to buy a share just before the dividend, you will lose this amount next day when the stock goes ex-dividend.

5. All new information drives stock prices up or down. This is the whole point of publicly traded stocks - the value of your stock changes instantly after some new information comes out. Does it give room to manipulation? Sure. That's why there are regulations in place to mitigate it.

6. Companies can not simply ""request to be bailed out"". It's always the decision of the government to bail out a company. If you don't agree with this decision - the problem is in the government, not the stock market 

7. Assigning ID to each share doesn't make much sense, because all shares are identical.

8. Derivatives market is a market of essentially trading insurance on shares. It is generally accepted that derivatives facilitate risk sharing in the economy, so a company that makes wooden chairs doesn't need to worry that it can go bankrupt if suddenly the price of wood goes up 10 times.

Generally developed financial markets go hand in hand with developed economy. There can be a debate of what comes first the chicken or the egg, but I don't think there is any evidence indicating that development of stock market hinders development of the economy. You can say that developed economy is not the only thing that is good for humanity (things like happiness and fulfillment don't entirely depend on how rich you are), but I think developed economy is a pretty good start for humanity.

getdisciplined,fneq5yx,t3_g15bbt,1586893872.0,"If you want to study sustainably, you need to learn how not to overload yourself with tasks on ONE single day.

Here is an example: let's say you can do a maximum of 20 pushups in one go. So one day you decide to do 20, and then (even though you are exhausted) you do another 10. The next day your arms hurt, so you decide that you need rest. The following day you still don't feel like doing pushups because it was just too much. The alternative strategy would be just to do 15 every day. For that you need to realize on the first day that you CAN do more than 15, but you need to ""save"" some for later. The total number of pushups during the 3 days is more with the second strategy.

Some will say that it doesn't apply to studying. I noticed that for me it does. If I do a lot of studying on one single day, the next day my brain tells me: ""you worked so hard yesterday, now you can rest a little"". ""A little"" turns into the whole day of not doing anything. So you need to anticipate these kind of scenarios in advance and study enough to get stuff done, but not so much that you would just be sick of it the next day."
