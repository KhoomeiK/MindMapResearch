What really pointed it out to me is that I could selectively trigger dysphoria and then increase it with exposing myself to things that make me dysphoric or lessen it with things that eased it. This is where the special person I mentioned helped me so much. They helped me see through the emotion and to a more rational view of things. I then systematically tested these things and took note of the effects on my dysphoria. Once I did it the first couple of times, it became easy, and I categorised a lot of things quite quickly. The number of things got to the point where I couldn't deny that there was something concrete there.

With that being said, I know my own limitations well, and I quickly found how far I could push things that made me dysphoric. Also, the severity of the dysphoria might be different for me through my lack of an inner monologue which necessitated this adapted system in the first place."

Generally for a death erection to occur, the death has to be swift or violent with significant trauma to the upper spinal cord or cerebellum - think hanging, shooting, blunt force trauma.

After 1956, the Pan-Atlantic Steamship Company (which then became Sealand), ships could be filled with standard-sized containers. This reduced load times from multiple days to around 24 hours. This was absolutely huge and allowed both short and long-range freightage to explode as an industry. This lead to purpose-built ships for moving the containers, purpose-built cranes for loading the containers, purpose-built forklifts for moving the containers, and purpose-built trucks for hauling goods to the containers. In this instance, the container itself lead to the streamlining of the industry as a whole.
