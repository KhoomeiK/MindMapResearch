And before I knew it I wouldnt eat until 7pm. I felt miserable through out the day at work. And I became obsessed what not eating until as late as possible. I wasn't happy and I knew it wasn't healthy. Of course it all came crashing down. I'm learning intuitive eating now and just knowing in the long run, as long as you follow an 80/20 rule,  you will be great."

progresspics,f303sw6,t1_f2ovk0h,1570545763.0,"Long post. Part 1 of 2
 

So prior to starting this, all I ate was delivery food and ready-made food in the grocery store. There wasn’t anything remotely close to a vegetable in any of these meals. I didn’t care; that part of my brain was shut off I just ate whatever I wanted. I didn’t work out at all. At my lowest point (highest weight) I could not walk for a long time before my lower back started hurting, I couldn’t cut my toenails, walking a flight of stairs felt like I ran a marathon. I was put on high blood pressure medication, early onset of type II diabetes. I still didn’t care for a while and continued on living like this for another month or so. I finally called up my family , said I needed help and they came over that night. I needed to follow a plan and learn how to eat healthy again. They monitored me like drug addict wanting to wane off drugs. I needed this and this is what worked for me.
 

My first goal was to focus on healthy eating. Stopped ordering out and started cooking my own food. It’s no secret really: fill up your food with lots of green vegetables, substitute bad for good fats, ate lean proteins. I was doing IF 16:8 and low carb, keto-like. It was a struggle trying to adjust back to this at first. I am also a victim of bored eating but with the help of my family it was manageable. I didn’t keep track of my weight throughout this. Even when I would visit for follow-up appointments I refused to look at the number. Reason is I get obsessed with it and it throws off everything.  
 

Next step was moving; just moving. Make minor adjustments. Instead of laying down watching t.v. sit up right. If you are sitting and have an opportunity to stand, do it. Starting moving. After eating, I would go for a walk or just stand up on my feet (it was struggle just to do this at first). I use to walk up and down the stairs in my building so I attempted that for the first time. I can still feel how much I struggled trying to do this; I always think back to this moment if I’m not feeling any motivation. So I did this every day, kept a journey and see how I progressed. Week by week I see that the number of flights have been improving so it was encouraging. I also started doing a full body, low impact circuit video so I can start doing some sort of body strength exercise. It about a 25 min workout.  I would switch between the two exercises and eventually able to do both on the same day, stairs in the morning and circuit after work. This was my first two months.
 

I was self-conscious of going to the gym up until this point but bit the bullet and just went. Again, started off slow, just moving. Focused on cardio (elliptical, eventually stationary bike) for 10 min, 20min…30min and intensity gradually increasing. Again kept track of my work outs and reflected on them. I incorporated strength training after about another month passed. 3 day splits: chest/tris, back/bi’s, shoulders and day off (kept track of progression). This was the next two months. Eating habits were the same. Even though I was more active, I wasn’t feeling more hungry. About month 5 is when the weight just started falling off and people started really noticing."
progresspics,f2qqdgu,t1_f2ovk0h,1570365574.0,"That's buddy. I will post; just dont wanna type all of it on my phone. 

I'm not as stricted in my nutrition but still conscious on healthy eating.  I'm focused on cardio and muscular strength. I think naturally I will fall back into that 150lb range."
GetMotivated,f2q9iid,t1_f2me544,1570358032.0,This. I did exactly what u/oonestepcloser84 did. Gained it all back and then some but seeked professional help both physically and mentally. It's okay to feel like this. You're not alone.

progresspics,f2lyob3,t3_ddr1ms,1570299680.0,"The last 4 years have been, to say the least, a journey. I went from the best shape in my life to gaining 100lbs, losing it, gaining back 120lbs and now almost back to normal. The definition of extreme yo-yo. It's different for everyone but it's been a mental issue with me; this time I got help with that and I think (crossing fingers) it's gonna stick. 

I posted to this sub the first time I lost 100lbs but deleted everything because I went back to my old ways and was ashamed. At that time, I thought I would just accepted my sedentary, junk food, and reclusive lifestyle. But I seeked help from my family and  professionally. It has done wonders. I can't thank them enough. 

I hope everyone here continues on their journey, meet their goals and continue setting new ones. We are only human. We mess up. We give up. We can reach rock bottom. But it's worth it to keep improving. Health is wealth (physical, mental)"
