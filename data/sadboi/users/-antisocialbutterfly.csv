mentalillness,fqdk3gf,t3_gi1ovl,1589291345.0,"Regardless of what it may be, if it is giving you hope and something to hold on to, then it's not stupid. This might not make a bit of difference, but you are so not alone. I have been struggling harder than ever lately. I'm not sure what exactly I'm holding onto, but I am. Let's hope today is at least slightly better than the last, for us. ‚ù§"

SkincareAddiction,fo8znlc,t3_g65y1k,1587607257.0,"Do you have to make a purchase to get the free samples? Or do they offer samples to ""try the product before you buy it""? I love DE, but it's just too expensive for me to by it."

Why lie about using a filter? And literally everything else? Ugh."

SCAcirclejerk,fmw1dqz,t3_fxoz0a,1586437210.0,Lmfao the irony of the original post being right above this post. It made it so much funnier.
askhotels,fm6njwg,t3_ftartm,1585798281.0,"You just need to be that bright, cheery, helpful person at the desk. Absolutely take initiative with things and stay busy. Maintain a professional relationship with coworkers. Be reliable and hard working. Ask questions from management, showing that you are intrigued and eager to gain more knowledge.


That was me at the desk, then I was promoted to AGM. Now I'm a GM. All within a few years, despite having no prior hotel experience before this property.


If you want it and you work hard, you WILL get it. 

Good luck and feel free to message me if you have any questions."

popping,fln9dsp,t3_fpnasi,1585313105.0,I had one of these on my right eyelid when I was younger. I had to have it surgically removed. Warm compresses definitely help to calm it down for a little bit.
askhotels,flhtf7c,t3_fox5h4,1585169159.0,Last year a new online program called Sertifi was implemented. It's an online portal for cc authorization forms. It's much more efficient and completely takes place of the paper authorization forms. I'm not sure if this is strictly for Marriott or if it's available for other brands.
AskDocs,fk17h0r,t1_fk16d06,1583773959.0,"No, not really. But it has drastically helped with the panic attacks. I saw a ton of negative comments when I first started taking it, but I'm so glad that I stuck with it."
AskDocs,fk167hp,t3_ffvlwh,1583773218.0,"When I first started taking effexor, I took it once a day in the morning with food. I don't particularly remember any bad side effects. I'm currently still on it, but a much higher dose."
askhotels,fjb5rms,t1_fjavo93,1583187034.0,"That's my thought too. I know it's done for management positions at some companies, but I've personally never heard of it for a front desk position. I would just talk to them about it. I'm sure they would be happy to explain it to you."
