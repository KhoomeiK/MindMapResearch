masskillers,fo6d3vx,t3_g5h9ih,1587555208.0,"This fucker deserved to see and hear the results of his actions. As satisfying as it is to see him dead, I would have liked him to soak up some of this tragedy he left behind. This happened a little while away from where I lived. So thankful none of my family or friends went for a drive that day."
Anxiety,fn9n8nc,t3_g02gqq,1586779134.0,"I struggle with this all the time. 

I find what usually works for me is being very attentive to yourself in that moment, and give yourself time to process what happened. Often, I find my initial emotional-driven reaction is often one I regret if I let myself go there, so I really try and stay aware in that moment and tell myself I'm perceiving it incorrectly. 

I get  better at it every time. I'm at the point now where I can push through the emotion, give an appropriate reaction, and after I give myself time to process the emotions in private it's like the storm gets tinier and tinier. Hope that makes sense!"

That's a great idea and it actually never occurred to me to suggest this to him. Thank you for the suggestion! He would likely be much more open to that."

Edit* both of us are also looking for jobs/neither of us have coverage

We lock our doors at night and when we leave the house. Pretty normal to us!"
relationships,f7o754z,t1_f7o6fyz,1573922102.0,"Thanks for your input! I agree more or less. She has done MUCH worse things and things I'm most likely unaware of, so I probably dont have a full grasp on what kind of fear hes dealing with that keeps him from speaking up. 

Yeah, I've locked the door on her once and I'm going to do it again. It was played off as if the lock was broken but I'm 100% going to do that and work on being more vocal."
rant,f7b81e4,t1_f7b5fn7,1573560221.0,I've locked the door on her to force her to be let in. I'm gonna start doing it again. Thanks! I doubt she will change.
rant,f7aulj4,t3_duy5x8,1573540858.0,"Your diagnosis should only matter in that it should give YOU information about how to move forward with your own life. 

Putting emotional expectations on ANYONE, even your friends and family, is a losing game. I would put all of my focus into coping mechanisms and understanding more about your own anxiety. 

No expectations makes it hard to be disappointed. That's always been my motto and it works more often than not"
