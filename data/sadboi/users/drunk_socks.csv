But I feel for you, I have an eating disorder (not the same thing of course) and I know for sure that this is something that I would do too, the difference is I would feel so guilty and apologetic, I’d know I was the asshole, and even though the reason I ate it is due to a medical reason it doesn’t excuse that it’s a shitty thing to do, apologise, try and explain that your pregnancy cravings are really bad and maybe see if you can talk about coming up with a way that you and your husband can find ways to make it easier for you to either eat a specific thing set aside for you, or find some way to curb your cravings etc?
I commented bc I personally feel like a lot of the comments on here, whilst right about you being TA, really don’t understand what it’s like to be in that craving/binging mindset and they’re being really shamey abt that, and that’s not the point imo."

  If he was saying that like, yeah I’m okay with that but I would also want you to try and address your issues and thus go to therapy that’s fine imo, but if he’s still insistent that you have sex with him it’s a bit dodgy imo, not that it’s a bad thing that he feels like sex is an important thing for him, but he shouldn’t make you feel like you need to have sex with him to feel like he wants you, and he should be v uncomfortable with the idea of making you do something that you’ve expressed you were uncomfortable with?

 Look at it this way, flip the tables, if he had come to you and expressed that he wanted to stop having sex for a bit, and you were a bit let down by that but still wanted a relationship with him, would you feel alright with yourself for making him feel like he needed to have sex with you in order to keep the relationship? 
My bargain is on no, and that’s bc it’s a shitty thing to do."

BPD,fpieu2b,t3_gdadnp,1588639454.0,"So pretty much since my teenage years I’ve been compared to every *manic pixie dream girl* you can think of, but especially Ramona Flowers bc I would dye my hair a lot as a teen and I guess sorta acted similarly to her?

 From the ages of like 15-18 I thought that was super cool and so I guess I kinda emulated her a lot, I specifically remember that I would speak how she did in the film, (although I’m also on the autism spectrum and I know that’s also common amongst autistic ppl so idk if that’s the BPD or the autism lol) and use a lot of her speech patterns/figures of speech, which was a little weird bc I’m not American and I know my dad would often call me out for sounding too American.

 When I was 18 I started dating a guy who was a few years older than me who was also a big fan of the comics and film, and he would often say he was exactly like Scott (he was) and I would jokingly say “haha I guess I’m your Ramona then!” Almost always he would say that I was more like Knives in his opinion, and this always made me sad bc to my dumb teenage brain I always kinda thought Knives was pathetic, stupid and dumb.

 Low and behold, a few months into our absolutely awful and incredibly abusive relationship that ended w me in a mental hospital bc of the damage he did to me, he cheated on me with a girl his own age who had cool dyed hair and was “cooler” than me, and I remember thinking “wow he was right, I really am like Knives, the dumb teenage girl who falls in love with an older guy only for him to cheat on her with a cooler, older girl, I guess I am as pathetic and stupid as I always thought’

 After I got out of hospital and was feeling less like everything around me would remind me of him and the shit he did to me I reread the Scott Pilgrim Comics and realised that... Scott is an asshole... and so is Ramona actually, and honestly Knives is sort of an amazing badass who realises that she deserved better than Scott and after she has a mini breakdown, she realises that even if she always loves him, she deserves better.

So yeah that’s the story of how I emulated Ramona Flowers for years until I realised that in reality I’m a lot more like Knives Chau and that’s pretty cool.

 Also I think it’s so important that you wrote this post, as someone who’s been in the mental health system for a long time I see how badly and unfairly the staff can be treated and I think it’s so important for it to be spoken about, not only for how it effects staff but also their patients, so I want to applaud you for making this post, I think it was really important."

When I read the title I thought, how could this dude be the asshole, he’s clearly worried abt his girlfriends health, but nah, you just don’t like the look of them... 

You said she’s been wanting this surgery for a long time, presumably because she’s uncomfortable with her body and insecure about herself, you also said she doesn’t like you seeing her naked, which just further leads me to believe that this poor girl is insecure about her body and the way she looks.

 Instead of telling her that you love her no matter how she looks, or encourage her to feel better about herself you decide to criticise her, over something so bloody menial... and then to rub salt (or aloe vera) into the wounds you top it off with reminding her to try and get rid of the scars as soon as possible...

We weren’t really allowed in there as young kids unless it were Christmas or there were guests over, for the exact reason you’re talking about here, and honestly I think it’s a good idea to have a nice room like that.

Now that we grandkids are reaching our late teens, twenties etc. we can actually sit down there and chill out, listen to records, play piano and remember the good times when we were younger and weren’t really allowed in there.

It’s a fond memory now; a special room because we were always made to respect it etc, and i love to go in there now personally because it reminds me of my granddad, maybe that’s an idea, since it sounds like that room is quite “nice”

I’m 21 one now but I DISTINCTLY remember being the little autistic kid who wasn’t invited to the birthday party when everyone else in the class was, and no it didn’t matter that the invites were sent via mail bc I can assure you, FROM EXPERIENCE, that all of the kids are gonna talk abt being invited at school and  most likely they’re gonna make fun of him  when they realise he wasn’t invited, he might be nonverbal and he might not be like the other kids but that doesn’t mean that he doesn’t pick up on every little thing they say or do that he’s not gonna be hyper aware that he’s different and that he’s not able to do the same things they are, whether the kids make fun of him or not (not to be a pessimist here but kids suck so I can assume the outcome of that one) you’re just highlighting to him and everyone else in the class that he’s different and doesn’t belong, and again, from experience, that’s gonna fuck him up in the long run.
You’re the parent, when your kid comes to you with a question like that you’re supposed to sit her down and say, “hey, I know *kid* is a little different, but that doesn’t mean he’s any less important than anyone else in your class, if you want to include everyone, that means everyone!” Shes your child, it’s your responsibility to teach her how NOT to be an asshole, but instead you’re instilling in her that it’s okay to not include people because they’re different, which I’m pretty sure is not what you want to teach your kid.
Also your excuse of “I don’t know how to handle an autistic kid” is such a dumb excuse, you’re a grown adult let alone a nurse, you know full well this kid is not gonna be dropped off on his own at a public pool."

Most people would do it if their family member was severely anorexic and close to death, and I think that misinformation about eating disorders as well as just mental health in general leads people to believe that it’s different for people who are severely overweight, but at its core it’s the same, this person has disordered eating behaviours that has brought their weight to a life threatening level, and at this stage needs to be put into care whether they want it or not."
