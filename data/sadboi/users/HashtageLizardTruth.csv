I felt like it really capture what it’s like being in a relationship with her; all or nothing. It felt like needing to protect her when she felt manic and wanting to love her back to life when she felt depressed. And honestly, it felt like being exhausted after playing both of those roles.

Because of that, I’ve picked up jogging and now I’m also becoming physically healthier as well as mentally. International self growth."

I also did checks on my body whenever I wanted to stop ex: is it my breathing? My pace? My legs? My form? And then I’d try to fix it.

I have a moment I can pin-point that was a major break through for me but it sounds like nothing. In a tough session, we were working through some stuff and I said something that felt real me to me. My T carefully told me “when you told me the story, you said you should be ashamed because of X but I heard was that X failed you.” It drastically, and in one fell swoop, challenged the way I saw myself. For me, that moment was a total mind-fuck. When I shared it with my partner, my partner didn’t understand why it was such a mind-fuck. It was so small but the impact was huge. 

So I don’t think it has to be this huge moment - I just think it has to be impactful to you."

Yeah, my therapist knows. I hugged her while crying pretty hard one time without moving my head and she made a joke about me leaving a trail of tears in an awkward place. Another time I didn’t move my head and she was literally petting the back of my head. She’s aware. 

Again, this culture of turning nothing into something is so ridiculous and unnecessary."

TalkTherapy,fh21zsx,t3_f143h3,1581231718.0,"I’m short, my therapist is tall. I usually end up being right at boob level whenever I hug someone tall. I usually move my head sideways so I’m not motorboating her but there have been a few times when I haven’t moved my head to the side because I needed the extra comfort. It’s never been weird but both of us being ladies probably helps.
Being short I always put my arms around her waist and hers usually wrap around but just below my shoulders. 
Our hugs length is usually whatever is appropriate but they happen after every session. They may be a quick hug after a session that wasn’t too heavy, but they may be a longer, more comforting hug when I had a rough go at it.
Once we had a session where my therapist was incredibly tough on me. She even asked at one point if she was being too tough and I told her it felt like it and she responded with something along the lines of “sorry but you need tough love right now”.  At the end of the session I had no intention of hugging her but when I was about to walk out, she stopped me and asked for a hug. 
I can’t remember the last time our session ended without a hug. They’re comforting, and I’m glad my therapist is warm and affectionate like me."

I feel like she has a good sense of sense of who I am, and sometimes the silence is because she knows I have more to say. Sometimes i don’t understand the silence but the silence is always spent with her looking at me at me, or trying to regain eye contact, but the attention is always on me so I feel okay with it. Idk. I’m not a huge fan of silence but sometimes when I share something particularly heavy, I do need a breather."

TalkTherapy,f94r16l,t3_e3rgrb,1575099160.0,"It’s weird  because I really have a hard time with intimacy. So much so that my therapist has lightly poked fun at it.  But at the end of the day, there is intimacy between my therapist and I. We do have a relationship, and while I know I pay for that relationship, her actions shows me that she cares about me beyond her obligation as a therapist.. but we’re not friends and I know very little about her. 

So it’s one sided, but I know in one way or another, she genuinely cares about me. People play different roles in your life, and her role is help me process trauma and learn how to best navigate my the adversity that has been coming my way lately. 

It makes me sad that one day this person will no longer play this role in my life, but when that time comes, it means I’m mentally healthy enough to handle things on my own. And you know what? Unless she retires or moves, I can go back to her if things start to feel too heavy again.

They have their place in our lives. And just like so many other people, it’s not permanent, but maybe take solace in knowing that you’ll get to decide when it’s time to walk away. We leave a lot of pieces of ourselves behind in other relationships - at least with this one, you know you left those pieces of yourself with a good person."
TalkTherapy,f8xn058,t1_f8xfez4,1574924627.0,"Thank you! I’m not against making eye contact but making eye contact when talking about something heavy is really tough for me. 

The eye contact does make me feel like I’m the only thing that matters to her in that moment, but sometimes that much attention can feel overwhelming. I don’t mind attention - I speak publicly for work all the time, but I’m in control of those situations, where as here I’m very vulnerable. It’s a weird place to be"
