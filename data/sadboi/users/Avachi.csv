Germans are a glaring exception. The recall rate is only 28% for that category, partially because of a relative lack of the modern German population‚Äôs participation in these tests. Also because of the relative youth of Germany as a collective nation‚Äîlike I said, my half ‚ÄúGerman‚Äù grandmother had less than 30% and her 1st cousin, 1x removed (full ‚ÄúGerman‚Äù) was hovering around 50. They were from the city Oldenburg in Lower Saxony and with one grandfather from Holstein, which would ideally mean a significant amount of ‚ÄúGerman‚Äù since that is part of ‚ÄúGermany‚Äù now just based off labels. But it doesn‚Äôt. OP and other colonial German-Americans (including my other grandmother) tend to have a significant amount of F&G in comparison, even with much older German heritage. This *indicates* the idea that a hotspot for the category *is* in more southwestern/western Germany. It isn‚Äôt literally all of Switzerland but Swiss Germans tend to have some of the highest amounts in this test and Switzerland is just tiny so it may have to just color in the whole country. Even if that is the case, it does not matter too much. Swiss Italians are a small minority historically located in one region of a geographically tiny country and Swiss in general score high. The general idea of the map is not incorrect. With all this said, like I said the category‚Äôs nomenclature is deceiving for many.

Yes, the high test involvement from people from the US likely skews this result, but because of that the results of the category itself is based off that population, which again, would have more ancestry from that area of the map. The map is simply for the category, not who is *actually* more or less ‚ÄúGerman‚Äù in modern Europe. Really what matters is the more broad categories that indicate regions like NW European, Southern European, etc. because the F&G recall rate is, like I said, only 28 percent.

edit: also Switzerland as a whole, including the Italian region, has around the population of London and NYC each, so using a minority of that size of a population to completely discredit the map is a little too Swiss-centric.

There is not enough genetic data for modern ‚ÄúGermans‚Äù which is actually noted by the people who made the map and shows my point that the part of the category for Germans is weak. Really, if anything is to be ‚Äúsilly‚Äù here, it‚Äôs the title of the category.

They were Northwestern German, which you could guess by the British & Irish and Scandinavian in the results.

But your father likely has Southwestern/Western German heritage based on how you said he has German ancestry tracing back for centuries. Most of those German immigrants came from what is called the Palatinate region in English, and also parts of what is now Eastern France, like Alsace, and both are part of the darkest red hotspot on this map:

Yeah if it was real it would‚Äôve come from a distant ancestor who may or may not have been part of the Transatlantic slave trade or slave owners  themselves, plenty of Western Europeans have trace amounts of Ashkenazi (like 1 percent or less), though you‚Äôre more likely to find it in Eastern Europeans.

23andme,fmd8sto,t1_fm8ueff,1585961922.0,"Not that much, though. And I seldom see a notable amount of Ashkenazi ancestry in black Americans. For ""Hispanics"" (Latin Americans) it is almost always there but usually fairly distant, around 1 percent (though you can see a little more and it's not surprising). OP's result indicates there was likely a great-great grandparent who was  Ashkenazi and he or she would have been born way after the slave trade was occurring. The Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves took effect in 1808 for the US. A lot of the Jews in the American South owned slaves, though, until the practice was abolished. (The Jewish population still wasn't very big at all in the US, and more lived in urban areas than rural). I would also say that Ashkenazi Jews did not play a ""major"" role in the slave trade as a whole, that is a myth."

Half of the service is finding relatives. Ashkenazi Jewish people have tons of ""close"" relatives because of their founder effect but you can still find unknown parental situations, siblings/half siblings, closer cousins, etc. Ashkenazim can have ""complicated"" families too.

Also there are more Jews than just Ashkenazim. Their results will look different."

Oh, and one more thing I am wondering about if you don't mind... On that record, when it mentions his parents, does it show a name before ""Margarethe""? I can clearly read the father's name but hers is harder for me to read, and I don't know German."

If a  parish has several villages, record village, parish, province, country.  Do not skip this step!

Yeah, I use Tweelb√§ke (for that line) and Ganderkesee (for another) in my trees to distinguish from the other Oldenburg for other potential researchers. There are cases where the ""Oldenburg, Niedersachsen"" is the most specific detail though, so yeah I use indicators that it's in Niedersachsen/Lower Saxony."
Genealogy,fm5pzur,t1_fm5n4xk,1585777668.0,"Thank you very much for the information. The history of that side has been lost down the family line, so I don't know a lot about what their real lives would've been like, other than the fact I know all of my ""recent"" ancestors on that line were farmers. My great-grandmother is the one this ancestry comes from, and since she was born around the first World War in the US, the assimilation into American culture was imperative in her childhood. She and her family spoke German in the home but no one in the next generation learned it.

>while at the same time displacing farmers

That's probably why her family came to the US to begin with. Hadn't thought of that.

>Check Conrad's marriage record or the birth records of any children he  might have had. What do these records say about his profession?

Another commenter said it looked like he was a bricklayers/masons apprentice, so he was likely building up the community... I can't find anything about children, just that one marriage record."

From what I've seen on records my male ancestors from Oldenburg were listed as farmers, and my great-great grandfather came to the US to farm in around 1900. So that occupation would've gone against the trend, for those few generations anyway.

Yeah they probably used the second name, I've noticed when researching female ancestors that was often the case, even if they didn't have sisters with the same first name."
