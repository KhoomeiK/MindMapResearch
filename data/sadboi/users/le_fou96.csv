workout,fi3iqib,t3_f60uv2,1582120118.0,"I was in the same boat until junior year of college. Not matter what i did i couldn‚Äôt bulk up. Its not just about drinking a protein shake after you workout. You have to hit certain caloric and protein goals. When I was finally able to bulk my appetite sky rocketed. I went from 150 to 190 in 2 months. It took me 3 solid tries at working out till I saw results. 

My advice is do your research, feel it out see what works and doesn‚Äôt work for you and find a workout buddy, itll help you stay consistent. In terms of protein powder getting something that doesn‚Äôt taste like crap is a good start but as you continue through your journey try to avoid brands that have sketchy additives like muscle milk"
