It is very possible the dog has food allergies that haven’t been figured out yet, so his food needs to be controlled. Vets often start with food that has hydrolyzed protein from either novel meat sources or a plant base. This means the protein is broken down so small the dog’s immune system doesn’t detect the allergen and react. These diets are often used temporarily to diagnose the issue.

OP’s mom could have started with OP at 20, had 5 kids over the next 10-14 years, and then left at 35 when OP was 15 like she stated in the post. That would give her plenty of time where it would be biologically possible for her to have a second batch of kids with husband 2.

The speed limit on the road I was on was 35mph and all the side streets had stop signs. Well there I was going 35mph with my grandma in the passenger seat and we’re approaching a cross street with a car stopped at the sign waiting to turn right onto the street I’m on. All seemed normal, but there was another car I could see was coming up behind the stopped car. It didn’t seem to be speeding or doing anything out of the ordinary, but something told me that car wasn’t going to stop, and I didn’t have time to stop if he wasn’t going to. So without thinking I floored the gas petal and sped past. It was a good thing I did because the second car ended up swerving around the stopped car, blew the sign entirely, and turned left behind me only narrowly missing my car.
