dating_advice,fr4pq9r,t1_fr4184l,1589894317.0,"You and the person beneath me i totally agree with. 
I have to admit, I was the gal with a one statement bio: ""I can bake cookies and change your oil."" 
Though I wasn't awkward, or socially whatever the hell, I was still nervous. I didn't join tinder for actually meeting someone; it was an entertainment thing. ** I was nice to the dudes so not in a fucked up way ** 
I never did use those filters though. Always did think they were dumb. 
Anyhow, I met my first love there. That was four years ago. After a heartbreak, and two + years apart, we reconnected and I ended up moving across the country to be with him. 

My point is: 
Be
Your wonderful
M'f self, homies.

depression,fr27wds,t1_fow06kt,1589832671.0," Though I didn't exactly know, I became depressed and suicidal by the time I was 7. 
Reading a lot of you guys give these ages really puts things in perspective for myself. 
Holy hell. 

I got out of it when I was 17. Moved out, graduated early after being two years behind, got an apartment, and lived my absolute best life. 
Then I got my heart and soul torn out of my body and BAM back to depression. It literally was not a choice. I tried to cling and tried to cling, but I was gone. 
Been here since, just far worse. 

My advice: get the hell away from people, places, things, etc that cause you pain. Don't try to plant a flower in Antarctica and expect it to be more than a seed. 
On the note of flowers- not all of them take the same amount of time to bloom. There's no set time for you, either."
depression,fr26r1z,t1_fov1vmg,1589832103.0,"Question- how in the world did you get out of depression without having a sense of self? Without knowing what to do, how to be you, etc? 
I always get hung up on figuring out the same things that you mentioned and therefore unable to break out of unbelievable misery. How'd you make it happen?"
relationship_advice,fr21wgy,t1_fr20kkv,1589829737.0," Not so much unable to accept that advice, but more so that I've worried that that's the case; this is abusive. 
Why I can't fully accept that is because I fear that I have a huge part in his reactions. Not always, no. But, nonetheless. 
He has been cruel. He has been selfish. He's been disrespectful on multiple levels - but when I tell him that, his response is always ""yeah, I know that feeling"". His response to anything and everything i tell him I feel or experience. That, that alone makes me believe that it isn't what I feed in/ my part. 
A constant battle of figuring out if I'm being manipulated or if it's childhood trauma; dramatic or being human (maybe even a sensitive human, for conversation sake); telling myself he's not trying to change me all while feeling like and even knowing he wants me to be anyway in which I'm not. 
He doesn't even understand that on good days, I still think horrible, dark thoughts. Tells me im faking on those good days if I still, internally, believe or think those things. 

It's a constant tug and pull. 
Constant confusion. 
Constantly mortified that he isn't abusive, that it's me... and constantly mortified that I've become my mother.

My point: I understand, and I thank you."
