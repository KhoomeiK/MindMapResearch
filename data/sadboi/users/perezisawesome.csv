One thing I did(because of my addiction for watching YouTube videos all day), I put my phone in airplane mode, and put it somewhat far away from me. Especially because any sound my phone makes, makes me want to check my phone. And so far, it seems to help with me focusing more. Also, I put it in my mind that I am studying in that moment and nothing else. Which makes me feel guilty if I don’t study.
And about that workout routine, do you stay up very late? Drink enough water throughout? I had to reduce my gym time but I make about an hour a day at least. Some gym is better than no gym in my opinion. Plus, over training could probably add to discomfort while studying.
One more thing, for the past few years my motivation and self confidence have also taken a nose dive, which is something I constantly fight against. Makes me feel dumb and lazy compared to everyone else who seem to be winning at life. But I don’t wanna be doing nothing either. Working at a dead end papa Johns for too long taught me that.
