And about that workout routine, do you stay up very late? Drink enough water throughout? I had to reduce my gym time but I make about an hour a day at least. Some gym is better than no gym in my opinion. Plus, over training could probably add to discomfort while studying.
One more thing, for the past few years my motivation and self confidence have also taken a nose dive, which is something I constantly fight against.
