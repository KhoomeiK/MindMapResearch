I *loved* everything with the development in Seth's storyline this week. I didn't see the recruitment of Theory coming at all, but I think it's a fantastic idea. I think this role will fit Theory way better than Zelina's group was for him. He just felt like such a random addition to that group. I liked the little touch of Murphy being jealous, even though I'm not ready for the Seth/Murphy partnership to end yet.

That main event match was just as good as I kept saying it would be all week. Corbin never gets any of the credit he should. Everyone always acts like they're so shocked when he has a good match, even though he's had several good matches before - they just end up getting brushed aside every time so that everyone can go back to shitting on him and pretending like he's horrible. That Deep Six on Drew was beautiful, as it always is. I wondered if he'd actually go for it, and he did, and I loved it. As for Lashley/Drew - I'm not 100% sold on it yet, because I haven't been the biggest Lashley fan since they dropped his angle with Lio, but I'm keeping an open mind since they're trying something new with MVP as his mouthpiece.
