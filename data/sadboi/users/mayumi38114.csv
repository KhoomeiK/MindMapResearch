BipolarReddit,fm02c5o,t3_fs3f21,1585641955.0,"If Bipolar was a country it would be a Themed Park Healing Center!!

It would be a round looking country with circular layers starting from the center point all the way to the outer circular layer. Every circular layer has its own (manic/depression) level of intensity. The center point is where all the most balanced people are living and the outer circular layer is where all the most freaked out heavily depressed and manic people are living (this is also a perfect defense system no intruder would ever be able to go through without losing their sanity). When the person switches in intensity of their episode they will be transported to a different circular layer corresponding to their episode level. So each and every circular layer has both the corresponding levels of depression and manic people living together.

Every circular layer has exactly specifically all the needs for each and every person experiencing their specific episode. See the layers as some theme parked level where everyone can do whatever they want. The manic parts have shops, restaurants, rollercoasters, parties, swimming pools, raining drugs here and there and everything the people would ever want FOR FREE, see it as a free for all rampage mode. Whereas the depressed parts will include big blanky forts, pillow forts, unlimited netflix, cats and dogs everywhere (ready to hug and cuddle anytime), chocolate rivers with cookie dough rain, comfort food everywhere and everything the people would ever want or need FOR FREE as well. Of course the intensity of the experiences available would be corresponding with the level of peoples episode.

Eventually the depressive and manic people will balance themselves out and end up peacefully together in the center point of balance. (To probably start the cycle all over again, haha)"

bipolar,ff71632,t1_ff6cnzp,1579639064.0,In my 6 years of taking several meds cocktails i gained around 30 kg. and it kept going. No doctor or dietician could ever help me out. They just simply said I had to accept these circumstances because it's better than being manic etc. I simply could not accept this so I started to look for other options. That's when I found out about a Low Carb diet. I actually lost 25 kg. in around a year. The bonus is that Low Carb actually cures the munchies due to the high amount of fat intake. I could really recommend anyone this diet.

endometriosis,eyyqv4f,t3_czfwu8,1567599078.0,"I've been to an endometriosis specialist center after years and years of suffering. They couldn't really do anything for me because they didn't find anything with the echo. They told me it could still be endometriosis 1st or 2nd degree. My situation is special anyway because i have Factor V Leiden, its a blood clot disorder that has to do with estrogen. Taking hormones is not really an opinion for me and because they couldn't find anything a surgery is not recommended. So I decided to take matters into my own hands and do a lot of research and experiments. A year ago i started a low carb diet, i lost 26 kg (fat is storage of estrogen and can amplify imbalanced hormones). Carbs mess a lot with your insuline which messes with your hormones again. Meat and diary actually amplifies any inflammation in the body and also messes with your hormones. I started taking two orthomolecular supplements called DIM (diindolylmethane) and serrapeptase. So the DIM takes care of hormonal imbalances, it helps the liver and balances  progesterone, testosterone and estrogen. After using DIM for two months my hormonal acné disappeared and i got a regular period cycle for the first time in my life. Serrapeptase is an enzym that cleans scars and inflammation from the inside out. After using serrapeptase for just one month i actually somehow had less pain overall. Since i started these things i've had 4 or 5 normal periods without any terrible suffering. However its not perfect yet, i still had months in between where i did suffer a lot again. I can only share that this has tremendously helped me on my path and i hope you will find a way to deal with it as well!

Edit: Also try to avoid xenoestrogens, these are in plastics/ sunscreen and mimic the estrogens in our body. I would recommend to avoid foods and drinks wrapped in plastic etc."

SpiritualAwakening,ex7924d,t3_crh453,1566057555.0,"Spiritual Awakening is an ongoing proces. It's a quest to truth, to grow our souls, to raise our consciousness and it happens in stages, this is what ascension means. Many people are still so deep asleep, running their daily life on auto-pilot. So if the deep sleepers are waking up, they try to find and look for truth. It's like how a baby starts to try to learn to walk, he is just trying his thing. One of those stages could be that you would find out that the government isn't 100% honest. You could find out that everything is truth and mixed up with lies to confuse us all. It doesn't matter what your friend believes, he will go through his experiences and grow his soul the way he chooses with his free will anyway. Everyone learns differently but everyone does learn. Eventually you could come to the conclusion how irrelevant the necessary beliefs are, because we can never know without we can only know within."
BipolarReddit,ex6agjp,t3_crh3ao,1566042266.0,I would like to share with you that it is not impossible to lose weight on (bipolar)medications! I've used several medications for 6 years straight and yes i gained 30 kg in total. I've felt hopeless and desperate and at a certain point i thought i would never have a healthy weight again. Last year in august i decided to turn my life around and somehow i ended up learning about a low carb diet. It has almost been a year since i started eating low carb and i lost 26 kg!! I do have to note that in august i also started to slowly reduce my medication intake with the help of a doctor. Since around november last year i am officially meds free. Even when i was still on meds i lost around 10 kg in the first months so it is definitely possible to lose weight while being on medications!!

Soulnexus,es8sl9l,t3_c6g951,1561712486.0,"Spiritual awakening/ascension is not about being in the happy cloud 24/7. It is all about experiencing, learning the lessons and growing to gain a wider perception. Yes this is super fun and also super sucky, which all come back to the 3rd dimensional duality lessons we are in. At some point some may perceive that there is no good without bad and no white without black. It is all a matter of perception. Good isn't necessarily ''good'' and bad isn't necessarily ''bad'' either. It is just a duality and both exist to be experienced.   


Whatever you are experiencing right now is part of your growth, even if it may not feel like this. It is your challenge to find out why it is like it is right now and deal with it. Why do you feel so tired of ''sheeple''? Why do you want to fuck off everyone and everything? Where does this come from? I could tell you that we should live from our hearts and feel compassion towards everything. Aren't ''sheeple'' beings too, with feelings and their own challenges? Isn't everyone doing the best they can in their ability? Everyone is experiencing, so that means other lessons, other perceptions, other possibilities than your own. However, these answers are something you should find and learn from within. We can learn knowledge from without but the wisdom comes from within. Keep doing what you are doing because it can never be wrong! I wish you good luck on your journey :)"

Then I was also starting to lower my doses to finally get off the meds. Now 10 months later I lost 23 kg, meds free, enjoying a vegetarian low carb lifestyle.   


I think it is very important to eat as raw and natural as possible (The food should balance your hormones and therefore balance your mood with the healthy fats and vitamins), keep up the sports (swimming, yoga, muscle build up stuff, HIIT, etc) which also boost all the positive hormones. Have a lot of patience and faith, it's all part of the self-care. I wish you the best of luck on your journey, believe it will happen and it will!! You can do the ting!"

It's like i can't seem to get the right amount of oxygen into my lungs, my chest or belly won't expand enough to take in the volume. It also happens when i yawn, it feels like a failed yawn. This used to happen very often but it gradually became less apparently. I actually forgot about it and didn't notice it was gone until it started happening again these last few weeks.   


I also have a lot of co-morbid issues so it's a puzzle to figure it all out. Currently the tendons in my knees and arm are really inflamed to the point i can practically not walk anymore. I also read that inflammation can cause oxygen deficiency in the cells. So that could make sense with the fibromyalgia. It could also be the muscle tension acting up weirdly. I used to be very anxious and stressed and had a lot of tight and tense muscles without being consciously aware of it, nowadays i meditate and do yoga and i am totally relaxed but it still happens.

To me the situation represents letting go of lower energies like jealousy, fear, breaking free from the indoctrination, etc. I personally never understood why this society is only allowing us to love one person at a time. Love is not something you can or should want to restrict. Love is beautiful, love is free, love doesn't need a reason and it's the thing we all want deep down inside.
