mentalhealth,evvh3g7,t3_clgnjp,1564836630.0,"I'm so so sorry for your loss. I hope you know how much you sharing this helps people like me. It's so hard to deal with mental illness. I lost a friend to suicide last year and seeing his family and friends at the funeral will stay with me forever. It was heartbreaking. I try to remember it when I'm in the middle of the black hole that is depression. 
I hope your family can heal together and get to a place full of happy memories. Sending much love ‚ù§"
