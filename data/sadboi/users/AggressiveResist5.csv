depression,fqixopf,t3_giwjh5,1589402294.0,I know what you mean. Quarantine is something we at least have in common.
depression,fq7szxi,t3_gh5rxn,1589151591.0,Good for you! Personally. I have to do things in sequence in order to do them in the first place.
depression,fq28e3d,t3_gg65k5,1589053759.0,"It makes perfect sense. I've had depression since 12/13 yrs. old. I have my own personality and like it even if people don't or won't understand me. God made me this way. I have many down days and have panic attacks. I'm tired of feeling guilty for a condition that I inherited. So, I have to live as I see fit. You have to account for your depression and make it a life that works for you. There's no cure. You can't get over it. Because I can't. Never have been able to. You just make a friend or two and live your life. Don't acknowledge the haters. Best wishes."
depression,fpwieq1,t3_gfqlvd,1588963996.0,I have to re-read stuff because although I want to read my mind is not focused. That just means for me I have underlying emotional problems that I'm not dealing with because of my depression. Makes me want to cry and go to sleep. Meds have helped to drown out some of that constant overthinking but I still have to overcome anxiety that makes my thoughts scatter. I had a panic attack yesterday because of an emotional trigger. I thought I was losing my mind. LOL.
depression,fpu5vry,t3_gf6llw,1588905341.0,No. You are who you are. Don't apologize. It's enough that you are you. I go through the same stuff. I don't need to pretend.
offmychest,fpi20v3,t3_gd661g,1588632110.0,Much love to you from Arizona.
offmychest,fpbwetj,t3_gc0fp3,1588480497.0,"My dad told my uncle that I was a head case with me in the house. I was about 18. Yeah, maybe I was but my dad was a major cause of it. He was a major alcoholic and was probably an undiagnosed bipolar. My advice is to get away from these toxic people when you can. I understand how it is for you."
depression,focs505,t3_g6kmv3,1587675120.0,Yeah. I know what you are going through.
depression,fnboxtq,t3_g0lst2,1586819472.0,"I have the same problem. However, I can't change how I am essentially. I'm a book reader and a follower of political science. Most people I know don't read or follow politics. So, I kinda get bored with people who aren't on the same wavelength. It's a conundrum. I think that's its about finding your niche."
depression,fn7l212,t3_fzov76,1586722462.0,I agree 100%. My family treats me like a piece of sh** because they know I have depression. It's a very lonesome life.
