BPD,fpu5a5k,t1_fpu4j5f,1588904965.0,It depends on your age too! If your under 16 your less likely to be given a bpd diagnosis even if you have it because they don‚Äôt like to do that idk why
BPD,fpu479b,t3_gfk1ts,1588904299.0,"From what I know bpd isn‚Äôt genetic and can‚Äôt really ‚Äúrun in the family‚Äù per se, it develops from childhood trauma and/or inconsistent parenting. BPD often gets misdiagnosed with autism or vice versa because there is a great deal of overlap. Bipolar mood swings last longer then BPD and BPD doesn‚Äôt involve mania which is why it‚Äôs somewhat easy to differentiate. I would reccomend talking to your psychiatrist or doctor to get an idea as self diagnosing isn‚Äôt necessarily accurate due to the great overlap and possibility of a medical condition causing the issues too."

BPD,fpskrmp,t1_fpsfzhc,1588875132.0,"I agree, like if you think about it BPD has so much overlap with autism and if I convince myself I am on the spectrum and go to psychiatrist for no it they can clearly tell I‚Äôm not I just experience some similar things and will not diagnose me with it. Yes they get things wrong and communication can be a problem but for the most part they do see a lot of people with stuff.
I agree about people not calling people out for backlash and also the romanticisation of mental health is a huge thing too. 

I felt like a cunt once when someone posted on here saying the psych said they don‚Äôt have bpd and they believe they did because they related to some stuff that people with bpd experience. I said my diagnosis was straight forward because they say I‚Äôm a classic case. The person ignored my comment because it didn‚Äôt fit their narrative of the psych being wrong and then acc having bpd. You shouldn‚Äôt have to force yourself to fit the mould of any mental illness because living through a mental illness is hell."

BPD,fpse2v9,t3_gf94dg,1588871910.0,"I don‚Äôt think this is glorifying but I hate how people with a shallow understanding of bpd will suggest problematic people (like youtubers) have it based on a few visible things. You can be a shit person without having bpd. Bpd also has loads of stuff like suicidal ideation, self harm, childhood trauma which is never acknowledged when people armchair diagnose. It‚Äôs so disrespectful to diminish our diagnosis and experience to JUST being manipulative, selfish or having mood swings. 
In regards to the glorification, people often post on this forum saying that they think they have BPD because they relate to some of the symptoms or their psych says they don‚Äôt have it but they think they do. Idk if sounds a bit mean but why would you want to have this? It sucks."

BPD,fn9p4c7,t3_g0hdyr,1586780794.0,"I‚Äôve always been described as a ‚Äúclassic case of bpd‚Äù by clinicians because of my childhood trauma and the negative patterns of parenting that led to me thinking and feeling the way I do. My diagnosis was pretty quick Cos specialists could easily tell but I didn‚Äôt cos I didn‚Äôt know about bpd - I just assumed it was depression and me being different/weird. 
I think on a glance bpd symptoms could actually be applied to various people but it‚Äôs the psychology behind it‚Äôs development which is what differentiates bpd from just depression or a certain attachment style. I‚Äôm no expert though that‚Äôs just my opinion. If you think you have it you should be entitled to discuss it but psychiatrists and specialists see a lot of people and have a wealth of knowledge too. I do know that some people with bpd get misdiagnosed with autism Cos the symptoms can appear similar and vice versa."
