I think it’s dangerous to list those things off as “symptoms” because it makes it seem like “oh, that’s just how I am.” Or you rationalize your toxic behaviors because “it’s because of my mental illness.” I’ve screwed up a ton, trust me. I have engaged in toxic behaviors. Trust me, I’ve treated people horribly at times. But those are not symptoms. They are things I need to change and can change with the right resources. They are my responsibility and I don’t deserve pity for them.

I want to get better. I deserve to get better. Part of that is owning the fact that I did something wrong and not acting as if I have no control over it or that I am somehow the victim."

I’m sure there’s a verse that opposes the one you have. But regardless, I don’t understand why people get all up in arms about people posting their good deeds. And I mean, no, you shouldn’t just go and do good deeds and exploit the less fortunate for praise, and I’m sure there are people who do that. But a lot of times, sharing your good deeds will encourage and inspire other people to do the same."

AmItheButtface,fox9mn1,t3_g9xr89,1588137610.0,"NTB. I was kind of like your sister. And adulthood did hit me like a truck. And I’m now paying the price for it at 22 years old. I was a little spoiled growing up. I was also privileged. My biggest issue was that I was coddled. Now, the things that your sister has convinced herself of are more extreme than what I did, but there are similarities, nonetheless. Things just came really easy to me. I assumed that I would go off to college and everything was going to be easy and I was going to get what I wanted. Boy was I naive. My grades in school were horrible. I completely underestimated the challenges I was going to face, so I wasn’t able to handle them. I’ve had to leave school. Granted, I suffer from anxiety and depression. But even without that, I wasn’t equipped to handle adult life because I had the mindset that things were just gonna work out and be dandy. 

If your sister has this mindset that she will always get what she wants, she won’t know how to properly handle it when she doesn’t get what she wants. She has to learn that she can’t get everything she wants. She needs to learn how to make do with what she does have. She needs to prepare for that and a big part of that is just realizing that it’s a possibility. If she doesn’t realize that there’s a chance of things not working out the way she wants them to, she will be unable to handle it when it happens. That she may not get what she wants, and she should maybe look at alternatives as a result. I wish someone would have knocked some sense into me when I was her age. And yeah, I would have reacted the way she did. That’s how 15 year olds are. But it ultimately would have bettered me. You did the right thing and I think it’s admirable that you are concerned about her future."

dancemoms,fopd2p0,t3_g8plzh,1587958472.0,"When the show first started airing when I was a young teen, I couldn’t stand Maddie. I thought she was stuck up and mean. To be fair, she was portrayed in the light for the first season. I never went on any of her pages and gave her hate or anything, just made some comments to my mom and sister when we would watch. But I still regret my feelings then. 

Maddie was abused too. Her abuse looked  different way than the other girls’ did, but she went through it, nonetheless. She was only a young child when she made the snootier comments, and I’m sure she was heavily influenced by Abby constantly saying those exact same things. It was a taught behavior and she actually seemed to grow out of it, which I am proud of her for. 

While it may seem like a good thing to be the “favorite,” it really wasn’t in this case. Abby put an immense amount of pressure on her. You can see it in the first couple seasons when she would get injured or screw up or forget the dance. She’d have full blown panic attacks because she was afraid Abby wouldn’t love her anymore, because all Abby did was praise her for her “perfection.” 

Abby actually emotionally and psychologically manipulated Maddie a lot. It kind of makes me sick looking back. Constantly telling her that all the moms were jealous of her and didn’t want her to succeed. There was one time where all the girls and moms went out into parking lot instead of going into the studio when they were supposed to be rehearsing. Maddie went too, because her mom made her. When she came back in Abby started crying talking about how Maddie had hurt her so bad and she shouldn’t have done it. She’s a CHILD. Who obeyed her MOTHER. If your feelings are that easily hurt by a child, you have psychological problems. I’m sure Abby also used that fear Maddie had of being hated to get her way. Abby’s borderline obsession with Maddie was also quite creepy and disturbing. 

Being a child star is hard enough but then combine that with what she endured with Abby... and I’m sure childhood was rough and probably traumatizing for her. And all the girls. This combined with Chloe’s post yesterday... I think in a few years we will hear more and more about what these girls suffered through and the effects it had. I hope they are now seeking treatment and on their way to healing."

Honestly if my sister asked my the same I would probably also decline. I could not handle having kids. And that’s okay.

self,fo9nq9l,t3_g69c7j,1587625042.0,"The virus isn’t going to be gone for at least another 18 months, possibly longer. It’s not feasible to stay locked down until then. 

We’re worried about saving lives, right? As we should be. So it baffles me how ignorant people can be to the life endangering risks of the shutdown. What about the people who can’t afford rent or to put food on the table? For a lot of people, that is not a topic for another time. People die from poverty. The longer we are shut down, the more poverty deaths we will see. 

Another factor is violence. The longer we are shut down, the greater the chance there will be riots and looting. People will get killed. 

There’s also the mental health aspect of it all. So many people are already suffering greatly with their mental health as a result of the shutdown. And it’s only been a couple months. As time goes on, more and more people will have deteriorating mental health, which can lead to suicide. Now, I’m not saying that the lockdown can cause clinical depression (although I’m not saying it can’t either- I’m not a doctor or well educated enough on the subject), but what I do know is it can trigger people with already existing mental health issues, leading them to suicide. 

And unlike the virus, these issues will not go away with a vaccine. Depending on how long we are shut down, it could take many many years, perhaps even a decade or decades to financially and economically recover. Some are predicting we may never economically recover. The economy isn’t just the stock market and corporations. It affects all of us. The worse the economy gets, the greater we will see poverty rates. And again, poverty can kill. If our economy collapses, we will see riots. Violence. That will kill. We will see more and more people simply giving up. Suicide will kill. The shutdown could cause an entire societal collapse. 

I genuinely believe that the effects of the shut down could end up killing more than the virus would have. And I’m not taking the virus lightly. Like I said, I want to save as many lives as possible. So I think there’s a compromise to be made. Enforce wearing masks and social distancing. Those who are able to work from home- do so. But it is ignorant and dangerous to think that the shutdown will save lives at no cost. It will save some lives just to kill others. I’m not one of those MAGA people going out and protesting. I’m a hardcore liberal, I voted for Bernie. But what I’m seeing from a lot of people, especially those from my political party, is that they aren’t thinking critically. I don’t use this term lightly, but a lot of people are turning into sheep. 

The thing that makes me most upset is the lack of empathy we are having with each other right now. I see people who advocate to reopen the economy constantly and unjustifiably being attacked. “You don’t care that people will die???????” “You care more about money than you do lives???” “You should sign something that says you will refuse medical treatment for covid if you get it.” It’s so disgusting. We are all terrified right now. And all fears are valid. That person who wants to open the economy. Maybe they aren’t doing it to be selfish, or because they’re sad finances are right and they can’t but a new flat screen TV anymore. Maybe they are doing it because they are terrified of not being able to provide for their families. Maybe they dont want their children to end up on the streets. Maybe they may not have to face this reality but are scared for the ones that will. Maybe they’re just as concerned about lives as you are. They’re just looking at it from a different perspective."

I’m still working on it through therapy. One thing that has helped me is when I get the urge to repeatedly text or constantly check my phone waiting for that response is putting my phone far away from me on a tall shelf.

prozac,fo63zjc,t3_g5x0in,1587545641.0,"Hey! I’m 22 and was first put on Prozac at 14. It honestly saved my life. Everyone’s experience is totally different but I didn’t experience any negative side effects. I started off at 20mg, then we upped it to 40, then we upped it to 60. We increased it because while I was feeling better each time, I still wasn’t 100% at the lower doses and there was room for improvement, so my doctor said we might as well keep increasing and as long as there are no bad effects and it makes a difference, we’d be good. 

I was also eventually put on Wellbutrin. We actually just increased the Wellbutrin. Yes, eight years later and we are still adjusting meds. It can be frustrating, but the unfortunate thing about psych meds is you don’t know exactly what will work. Plus, I was a kid when I started, my brain probably has gone through changes, and life circumstances have become increasingly difficult for me as time has gone on. 

I have no regrets trying and staying on Prozac. I still struggle a lot, but I think I’d been in an even darker place and maybe not even alive had I not sought out meds. My therapist and I were actually just talking today about how meds are not a cure all. They won’t make you feel 100% better. But what they can do is get you stable and okay enough to the point where you are capable of working to get better through therapy or whatever you’re doing for your mental health (I highly recommend therapy). My doc always says that the combination of meds and therapy is usual the most effective for people.

I sometimes wish I wasn’t on meds. Not because I had any negative effects, but just because I don’t like the thought of pumping my body full of stuff. It feels unnatural. I mean no one WANTS to be on medication for anything. But ultimately for me, the help it gives me is worth it. Just like someone with heart disease needs to take meds for their heart, I need to take meds for my brain. And that’s okay. There’s a lot of BS out there from ignorant people who don’t know what they’re talking about when it comes to meds. They’ll say it’s always unhealthy or ineffective or this or that. But remember that you can post literally anything on the internet. That doesn’t necessarily make it all true. So from personal experience, I would advise against doing *too* much research about psych meds. If you do, look for credible sources. The Mighty is also a good place to hear about people’s first hand experiences with mental illness, including medication. The most important thing is to listen to YOUR body and mind. If it’s not having I’ll effects on you and if it’s helping you feel better, then there’s no harm or shame in doing what is best for you.

I assume your doctor is starting you on a low dose so if for any reason you do want or need to get off of it, it should be fairly easy.

We recently increased my Wellbutrin to 300mg and I’ve been feeling better since making that change.  We’re gonna increase to 450 soon because there’s still room for improvement. Meds definitely haven’t been a cure all. It’s been 8 years and we’re still having to make adjustments. It’s probably also because life circumstances have changed and I have physically grown. But they definitely do help.
AmItheAsshole,fo227p2,t3_g51c9m,1587447517.0,"YTA. Big time. But not necessarily for telling her the way you did- YTA because of how irrationally mad you got at her and the way you shamed her for her feelings. She was not making it all about her. Maybe you’re not a crier, but take it from me, who is one. When I hear something that upsets me in the slightest, I cry. It’s an automatic thing. I can’t control it. I can’t stop it. It happens. 

She did the polite thing by excusing herself. You say she made it all about her, but if she wanted to make it all about her, she wouldn’t have left. She was attempting to pull herself together and she even had the kindness to come back and try to show support when she was hurting inside. 

You’re not really TA for telling her over a group zoom, though I do feel that was the wrong decision, knowing that she has fertility issues and is sensitive about it. I genuinely just think you didn’t think of this. But the way you reacted to how she reacted.. it’s frankly sick. 

You come across as very conceited and narcissistic. You claim you “apologized.” Girl, that was NOT an apology. “I’m sorry you’re upset” is NOT an apology. An apology is accepting, identifying, and rectifying YOUR ACTIONS. You say she’s acting like the victim and frankly that is so ridiculous that is 100% YOU. You act like you’re such a victim because she cried when she was upset about something. And then you go and act like the victim here when you’re like “I can’t believe you would say these things to a pregnant woman.” Grow up. Your friend didn’t act like the victim. But even if she did, she would have a right to because you treated her terribly. The things you have to say about her are baseless and horrible. I would never speak about a friend that way. “I wasted ten years of my life.” Come on. 

You’re also one of those people who I don’t get. You come on this sub, asking for people’s takes. They provide them, and you get mad and defensive??? Why did you post here then??? You clearly didn’t want an answer you just wanted validation because deep down you know what you did was wrong. 

YOU are the toxic one here. I genuinely recommend some therapy because your thought process is very backwards. I don’t say that in a malicious way. I go to therapy myself. You need to accept that what you did was wrong and work to fix it. It sounds too late for you and this friend. But you need to think about this before you lose other people due to your toxic behavior."
mentalillness,fo1wm43,t1_fo1ul3n,1587443205.0,Yeah it might be worth mentioning that I had been feeling suicidal prior to being prescribed so it may have been more necessary/justified to give it to me than someone with different symptoms. I’m on Wellbutrin as well!
mentalillness,fo1q1ws,t3_g56jf2,1587438836.0,Your experience is totally valid and I’m so sorry you’ve gone through that. Psych meds are difficult because it’s not a one size fits all. It’s not like a physical illness where you can see exactly what’s wrong and know exactly how to treat it. But what I do know is I started taking Prozac at 14 and I’m so grateful. It honesty saved my life. I don’t think I’d be alive today had I not been put on meds. I do agree that doctors should be prescribing these things carefully and not just willy nilly. And they should be monitoring their patients’ side effects and starting everything off at a low dose. But I think it’s important to note that it CAN be successful and even life saving in some minors.
AmItheAsshole,fo1k5if,t3_g501s3,1587435053.0,"Guess I’m in the minority but NTA. This is something that is happening with YOUR body, where you will be extremely vulnerable.

I suffer from depression and have been going through are particularly difficult spell since the new year started. I know what it’s like to lay in bed and not have the energy or motivation to do anything else. It can feel so painful. Too painful. I don’t brush my teeth every day. Or shower. I rarely brush my hair. It isn’t simple at all when I’m in such a dark place and the thoughts and feelings are so heavy. Last week, my therapist and I set a goal. Every day, move from the bed to the couch. It doesn’t matter what I do once I’m there, I just need to make it to the couch. It sounds so simple and makes me feel pathetic at times that that is my goal. But it’s a challenge I can manage right now given the circumstances. I’m proud of you. We’re gonna be okay. Much love."

Money’s nice but doesn’t always communicate that you care, which is what some people care more about. I think they just want your support, which is understandable. You showing up means that you are happy for them and think they are worthy of your time because you care about them so much. Not attending sends the opposite message. If you are so antisocial that you seriously cannot bring yourself to attend important social events, I suggest you look for a therapist. And I say that in the nicest way possible. I also see a therapist. Our flaws do not necessarily define our character, but our willingness to improve upon those flaws does.

One of my things is I personally HATE funerals. Like I know no one enjoys funerals but they seriously make me SO uncomfortable. I cannot explain to you how much I despise them. I don’t like going. They don’t assist in my grieving. I grieve on my own. But I go. Why? To show their loved ones that I am there for them and I care. It’s the right thing to do. Sometimes we have to make small personal sacrifices for the people we care about. That’s the whole point."

AmItheAsshole,fnrnzt6,t3_g31wgb,1587195249.0,"YTA. The weight loss “methods” your daughter is attempting are extremely unhealthy. She doesn’t know any better, but as an adult, you should. Having “off limits” foods is not a good strategy. You just end up feeling deprived and end up binging later. She needs to learn moderation, portion control, and a healthy BALANCE. She was probably so desperate for all the “unhealthy” foods at the restaurants because she has been deprived of them. Also to use food as a reward is extremely toxic. “If you lose this much weight you can have a cheat day.” What?!?! What if she’s desperate for a cheat day so she goes to desperate measures to lose weight? You’re doing this all wrong. Please talk to a doctor."

BPD,fnrc0lu,t3_g3dh21,1587184568.0,"I go through the same exact thing. I never manipulate on purpose. Like it’s never “I’m gonna say this to make this person feel bad or do what I want.” It’s just that I say how I’m feeling and it ends up being manipulative. Like when someone goes a while without talking to me and I feel abandoned. I’ll say “you don’t care about me, you’re never there for me.” And I don’t say it to make them feel bad, I just say it because it’s how I feel and it’s so strong and it feels like I need to let it out. Just know you aren’t alone and you aren’t a bad person. That’s not to excuse your actions, we should always grow to be better and try to eliminate toxic traits. But some toxic traits or bad actions don’t define who you are as a person. Do this for you. Work on yourself so that you can become the truest version of yourself and be able to maintain wonderful relationships that you deserve.

As far as coping, definitely the number one thing is therapy. It’s not an easy thing to learn, that’s why there are doctors who spend years and years studying to become psychologists. They can offer insight and resources and coping mechanisms that others can’t. Not every therapist is a good match though, so it’s okay to “shop around” to find the right one. The only thing I can say is because I know I have a tendency to unintentionally say manipulative things, when I’m upset, I try to remind myself not to say anything at all. That’s much easier said than done, and again, that’s where therapy can help. But just walking away from the situation, taking deep breaths, journaling and self soothing to help calm me down. Then I return to the conversation and am usually able to express myself healthily and effectively. If it’s a text conversation and feel like I am going to send an impulsive text, I’ll literally turn my phone off and put it on a high shelf to keep me away from it."

prozac,fnr1rwy,t3_g3fr82,1587177233.0,"Hi! I’ve been on Prozac for 8 years. Started when I was 14 and now I’m 22. I started on 20mg, then it was upped to 40, and now I am on 60. I’m also on Wellbutrin. I don’t plan on stopping anytime soon. I still struggle a lot so going off now would be bad idea. Especially with all the life changes and adjustments that happen in your 20s. I don’t mind taking it and it helps me so I’m in no rush. Maybe eventually I would try to go off it, so I wouldn’t have to pay for the pills anymore, but the thought of that kind of scares me because I’m sure my body is so used to the med. Because I’m still having a hard time, it’s not really something I’m thinking about now. I’d like to be “stable” for a few years before maybe weaning off.

Edit: also every time I go to the doctor, he reassures me that some people wean off, but some people need it their entire lives and either is okay."

What I find most disgusting is she’s told people with eating disorders before that it’s because they aren’t vegan and veganism can “cure” eating disorders. A lot of times the people she calls out have never said they have an eating disorder, she just assumes they do. I’m all for promoting veganism if that’s your thing but don’t personally attack people for not believing what you do."

AmItheAsshole,fn8y5gm,t3_g05lhs,1586753475.0,"YTA. Lesbian here. Freshman year of college, I lived in a suite with five other girls. Straight girls. Some of them would even walk around in their underwear because pants are uncomfortable. I had literally zero attraction to any of them. Not romantically. Not sexually. None. I never “checked them out” or fantasized about them or anything. We were all really great fiends and really close, and I loved them, but strictly platonically. Being gay doesn’t mean we’re attracted to literally everyone of the same sex. Don’t flatter yourself. The sight of any female body in any context does not automatically make me aroused. I have the same damn body, it’s normal to me. And it would be the same with you and a gay guy. You cannot assume he would like you. And you can’t act as if he will go around being attracted to you. Because again- he also has a male body. He’s used to it. It’s not automatic attraction.

What I will say though is that if you genuinely don’t think you can keep your homophobia at bay, don’t get a gay roommate. For THEIR sake. They deserve to be respected. Because, yes- you are homophobic. You may not realize it because you don’t go around beating up gay people, but that is not all there is to it. But don’t just sweep it under the rug. You have to try to improve. Learn. Listen to LGBTQ+ voices.

Edit: I see you’re responding to a lot of comments with “wHeN dId I sAy He WoUlD aUtOmAtIcAlLy Be AtTrAcTeD tO mE??¿¿¿??” That’s not the point. To even think there’s a chance of him liking you is delusional, conceited, and yes, homophobic. Do you go around thinking there’s a chance that every single girl is attracted to you? Actually, given what you’ve had to say, I wouldn’t put it past you. But guess what? The chances of someone not being attracted to you are MUCH bigger than someone actually being attracted to you. So, again- get over yourself."
