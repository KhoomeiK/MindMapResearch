I'm making an AP and we took a year of planning and researching to make sure what we wanted to do and do it right. I have a lot of pet peeves with APs as a listener, that just seem to be status quo. I don't understand why everybody does the exact same things, but I do in a way because it's just what they are used to. I notice the same thing with youtubers and twitch streamers. It worked for somebody else so let's cookie cutter this shit. Nah, that ain't me. Unloading on backstories has become a huge pet peeve after my wife pointed something out to me. Why unload a backstory of a character nobody knows or cares about? You look at good books, tv shows, movies, or whatever and you get their backstory as it comes up. So the way we shifted for that, is where the characters came from to get to the beginning of the campaign is a mystery as much as the one they are trying to solve to the listener. They have amazing very thought out backstories but that just gives me fuel to build the story as we go.

I would love to get feedback from you for our AP. It's Microphones & Monsters. We just released Ep. 11 yesterday. It is a 5e actual play podcast using Sandy Petersen's Cthulhu Mythos to help build a world and campaign filled with mystery and cosmic horrors. Easily bingeable with 30-45 min long episodes.

I do understand the want to get started on releasing immediately and the excitement of it, but if you could maybe prep a little bit and put together equipment and build editing skills over time it will be more rewarding in the end.

I'm just saying this from experience. Had the idea we wanted to do a podcast a year ago and releasing first episode next month with a nice backlog to keep a consistent schedule. In that year of prepping and planning, by the time we started recording we went from a tiny mixer I got for free to a very nice interface. Better knowledge of editing software, microphone awareness, the campaign changing slightly over time to where it is honed in and structured for a listening audience as well as for our own entertainment, lots of research and listening to APs of all different qualities and styles to figure out what we do and don't want to do.

I saw first hand the amount of just wasted money we are throwing away on a daily basis over there. Take the air dropped loads of food and water for example. We were sending out massive orders of water and food on a daily basis, breaking records, working insane hours with just a small detachment, getting sick and injured from over working. Well... I actually met one of the guys that was picking up our loads after being medevac while I was in Getmany (We would sometimes put little notes on loads especially if we were dropping something like steaks, saying to enjoy the steaks and stuff). He had told me that they were getting drops from us so much that they weren't able to store it and were throwing food and water into a burn pit every time they received drops.

So turns out that we were wasting thousands of dollars every day on jet fuel, manpower, water, food, fuel for trucks, just so some Officers and Warrants could pad their resumes for promotion. Oh we got medals of commendation for breaking records, for wasting money, but we don't have money for healthcare or to make sure kids can eat a school lunch. I'm called un-american though because I want things for citizens, not trillions more dollars funneled into another war."

schizophrenia,f86zht2,t3_dylewe,1574311046.0,"My schizophrenia slowly went the opposite direction. I was a christian and I considered myself a good Christian I guess. When my symptoms started it went from seeing guardian angels to being attacked by demons. I prayed and prayed for help, answers, something. I asked why would God let something like this happen to me? 

It opened my mind. I really started paying attention to the world and all the people that suffer fucked up shit, physically, emotionally, and mentally. I started asking why would a God that is supposed to love us allow all of these things to happen. I realized that God, or at least the concept of God in religion wasn't real and that religion is just a means to keep people blind and under control. The rich and powerful take advantage of and control us, while they live by a different set of rules. 

Now I see portals, I see people that I love die, I see myself losing the real things in this world, the demons and angels are gone. I feel like as I've  changed the things I hallucinate change, it still happens all the time but it has slowly changed as I view the world differently. It's hard to explain I guess. I remember reading an article, I believe it was shared here, about how other cultures that aren't filled with violence the schizophrenics have more peaceful hallucinations. Idk how true that is but it is sort of comforting in a way that the fucked up shit I see is just in my mind because we are surrounded by violence."

Also 3 year old Beth has a more round head. Rick's wife, when in the brainalizer, doesn't really have a long head. Jerry's mom doesn't have a long head.

Or none of it matters and it's just the way they were drawn."
podcasting,f7oh6kd,t3_dx811e,1573927385.0,"I don't recommend a mixer. I recommend getting an interface. They seperate each mic to it's own track and it is easy to setup, just plug and play. As far as interfaces I recommend a Focusrite Scarlet 18i20 has 6 inputs for XLR Mics. The 3rd generation has come out recently so you can find some pretty cheap new or like new 2nd gens available out there.

Just got a 2nd gen 18i8 for a 4 host actual play podcast that we recently started recording. The quality is amazing, sturdy design, and works well with Reaper. 

If you want something cheaper Behringer interfaces are about $100 cheaper but not as good quality."

TitansTV,f6afix5,t1_f67xovi,1572756146.0,"There is also the Bruce that allows them to learn on their own. He won't always be there to save their ass. If he had to hold their hand they shouldn't be doing what they are doing. In the comics even, after Jason's death and Tim becomes Robin, he is almost non-existent in Tim's/Robin's life and training early on.

In the show, Dick left. He wanted to be independent. He also put Jason in Dick's care, and is allowing both of them to prove themselves. He trusts Dick, whether he may be secretly keeping tabs on them without interfering to see how it plays out, or lost in delivering his own justice in Gotham/wherever. Both have happened in the comics."
TitansTV,f5n4k3z,t1_f5mrjd6,1572296577.0,"Honestly depends on the artist or live action portrayal on the color of the Flying Graysons uniform. The design of the Original Robin costume was based off of an acrobatics uniform and the colors were to contrast off of Batman. The design stayed the same from the 1940s until after Jason died and Tim accepted to take his place in 1989ish. The old design was kinda retired to honor Jason, which Tim wore for a short time to defy Batman's orders to not leave the cave to help when Tim couldn't contact him to warn him. The suit took some major upgrades and color changes over the course of Tim's time in it before Damien and becoming Red Robin. I just recently read a lot of comics focused on Robin so all of this is kinda fresh in my mind lol.

Tim is my favorite Robin because he was less of a sidekick his whole time as Robin, due to Batman always doing his own thing, finding himself, ""dying"", or Tim not able to stay in Gotham. Probably the reason for the color changes as he separated himself as a sidekick and was more independent."
