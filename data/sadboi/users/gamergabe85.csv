Truckers,fqomtn3,t1_fqnmrgk,1589519038.0,"I was delivering for Kroger in Atlanta. I was still pretty green when it came to driving and backing by myself. I was used to having a teammate helping me because I just didn't feel confident enough to drive by myself just yet. I was needing a little extra money and dispatch said they had a short haul from my hometown to Atlanta. About three hours worth of work and be back home for the weekend.    
    
I get there and OMG I knew why no one wanted to take it. This place was a nightmare to get into and back into a dock. I feel like this was a DC that was built during when cab overs were still on the road. This clearly wasn't a place for trucks with front ends like we have today.    
    
I get checked in and have to wait in my truck for them to give me a ring on the cell. About thirty minutes go by and they give me a call and tell me to pull in. I pull in and do almost a complete circle around the building. Spotter stops me and tells me which dock to back into. I get out and open my doors and check the dock for all of fifteen seconds. I have about a foot on each side to play with. Plus being in a piss poor setup due to the way this DC made. To make matters worse they're other drivers waiting on me to get in the dock.    
    
There's a driver on my blind side with his window down. I tell him I'm green and to give his horn hell if I start getting close to his truck or trailer. He kinda laughs at me and says I'll do all right. I get back in the truck and start my back. Little to left, little to the right, rinse and repeat. I get it in the dock. Not a single pull up and perfectly straight. Also on my driver's side was the DC break area. Not only did I have seasoned truckers judging me but dock workers as well. I feathered the clutch and made incremental progress while backing.    
    
I pull the brakes and ask the drive on my right what he thought. He said, ""I knew you could do it and you didn't even get close to my rig or trailer. If you hadn't told me you were new I'd thought you'd been driving for several years."" That was a big confidence boost for me.    
    
I've had my bad days though. You'd think I was fresh outta school. Look like a noob on a relatively easy back. Each pull up you get progressively more pissed off.

funny,flz7sar,t3_fs0jiy,1585617415.0,I know this is done in good spirit but these people have enough money to live years without pay. I've been laid off and just received my last full check.

I'm honestly worried if my lay off lasts more than more  another week or so I'll be forced to look for another job. I'm not worried about finding a job as I have CDLs but I don't want to be forced to go back over the road either.
