Hamilton,fm2nzgh,t3_fslejy,1585701482.0,"This is a fantastic idea and I’m surprised many haven’t been doing it. We’ve done it a couple nights but it’s pretty lonely 😋 It would be great to make a group and encourage people to join in at the same time. The front line workers I personally know around Canada who have witnessed the thank yous, pots and pans, signing and chanting firsthand have said they’ve been brought to tears and expressed how much it means to them that the community is supporting them!"

Apologies, as it was not intended that way. I’m glad that you are fortunate to not be in need of assistance, and it’s nice to hear you’re helping out how you can! The world needs more of this, and from everyone that does need assistance, thank you for doing what you have!"
Assistance,fl413ib,t1_fl40rc8,1584803452.0,"Yes it is, I’m not hiding that at all. Someone else helped me out by sending me their code, and I am passing along the promotion. Not sure how the post is misleading, the promotion is exactly what the post says. It also states it is for new customers only. If you’re not interested, move along as others are. No need for negativity. Have a good one ✌️"
Assistance,fl40vsg,t1_fl40jp1,1584803305.0,"Shame on you, you must not have much to do with your day but comment on threads that clearly do not pertain to you. You may have the luxury of being able to afford takeout, but for many, it’s not an option. Someone sent me their code and it helped me out when I was in a time of need.

Who are you to say that I am not still in a time of need with everything going on in the world today, maybe this is the only way I’m able to eat due to people being off work and no assistance being currently available.

This helps local businesses stay afloat by giving them business. It also helps someone who may not have been able to afford dinner. If you’re not interested, simply move along. Your negativity is not wanted or needed here. Have a blessed day, remember that you never know what someone is going through. I’m glad you’re not in need of this, you’re lucky, and I wish you the best. ✌️"
