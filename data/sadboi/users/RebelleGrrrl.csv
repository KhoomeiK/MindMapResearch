ptsd,fhu9ycg,t3_f4oixq,1581883851.0,"Yes. It is cultural and intergenerational. I'm not sure where you're from, but I'm from the US. Just look at our history and how our country was founded ... there is so much pain there. Massacres, enslavement, oppression... among many other things.

Culture plays a very important role in human development along with family, schools, church, and other social groups. It shapes our worldview and values. Many people learn to just perpetuate those values without questioning it, because why would they? It's just normal in that culture, it's how we grew up, what we were taught and it is the norm. Everyone else does it. And so it just keeps getting passed down.

On top of that, newer studies in epigenetics have shown that trauma as far as 2 generations back can be imprinted onto your biology before birth. So if your grandmother experiences a trauma, this can be something you carry unknowingly in your body as well. 

I think the only way to break the cycle is to really look at our behaviors and values, question where they originate from, and ask ourselves if they are even applicable to our life in the present or if it's really just an outdated remnant from the past. It's not easy because many of these thought patterns are unconscious. That's why I think it's important for people to get therapy... I think more people should look inwards and really look at what's there, what drives their behavior,  what fuels their thoughts. Even people who don't have PTSD or have never experienced trauma per se, can still carry stuff unconsciously that could influence your thoughts or actions without your awareness."

So *not* running away from the relationship, even though the relationship is safe and healthy, can literally feel like I'm in danger. Hopefully this makes some sense.

She also bought two different houses, one of which she currently lives in, in the same neighborhood of the house where I had told her the abuse happened (later on). When I lived with her I had to drive by it every day. 

My favorite tho is the mother of the boy that was abusing me seeing it happen multiple times (over the span of 2 years) and allowing it. And she still never helped me."

Honestly, this might be an unpopular opinion, but that is a big red waving flag to me. If I were you, I would dump him. Like, yesterday. Are you working with a therapist? You're putting yourself into a position where you are being encouraged to continue to expose yourself to an abusive situation. That's not okay. 

I'm really sorry if this is triggering, but by reading your post, I kinda feel like you already know this. You can't heal from your trauma while you are constantly being invalidated. What other feelings does he invalidate? You said that he makes you question your own perception. That's not ok, not at all. In fact, that sounds a lot like gaslighting. 

You said he downplays or defends abusive behavior, and calls you paranoid when you are being manipulated. How is that not harmful to you? How does that not continue the cycle of abuse?

Your feelings and experiences are valid, always. Don't let other people define your experience for you. You know the truth."

Social psych has also highlighted a lot of what you mentioned regarding cultural patterns and how they are being passed down through generations. We learn social norms from our families, schools, churches, and other groups that become deeply imprinted and many people don’t question those ideas.

My campus is very diverse and I’ve been surprised how many people I’ve connected with that are trauma informed. I have also very commonly connected with others who have experienced trauma. It’s been a great environment for me to accept mine and to speak up about it, to make it my own and create it into a larger dialogue that helps others either to connect or to see another perspective. It’s wonderful because the area that I moved from had a very different demeanor regarding mental health, it was more stigmatized and shameful and not something that should be openly discussed.
