LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,flbtiaj,t1_flbmtn2,1585012251.0,"yeah but i mean, if they had like one LGBT couple, then it'd be pointless. you know what i mean? one lesbian on the boys side with one lesbian on the girls side? that'd be a waste of time.

if there was a gay special where it was all women or all men that'd be pretty cool, except watch someone on the same side catch feelings for one another. Don't get me wrong, i love the LGBT community, but it would make it quite complicated"

Get a journal or something to eat. Chewing gum helps me relax. My final tip is to take deep breaths and remind yourself you are not sick.
