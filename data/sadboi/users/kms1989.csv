If you asked her to be in your bridal party, I‚Äôm assuming she‚Äôs either family or a close friend. You essentially just let a dress get in the middle of your relationship. You invited them over to discuss dresses, that would warrant a discussion on what they all want to wear. If you don‚Äôt really care how they‚Äôll feel then just pick a dress and say ‚Äúthis is the dress! Order it by XX date!‚Äù 
You kicked a friend out of your bridal party over her being honest about the style of dress she likes. Let that sink in. Pick a color and give them some parameters and let them hunt for a dress they like with you being able to veto dresses. Weddings with bridesmaids all wearing the same dress are over done anyway, and I say that as someone who had al her bridesmaids wear the same dress. Not every style looks good on every body. 

Ultimately, weddings don‚Äôt matter. My wedding didn‚Äôt matter. My marriage matters and my relationship with my friends and family matters. You possibly just ruined a friendship over a bridesmaid dress. Good job. YTA"
AmItheAsshole,fdzb7xa,t1_fdwy9av,1578788443.0,NAH- don‚Äôt let it get to you and use the credit for a dress for yourself if they‚Äôll allow it. Or see if a friends daughter is getting married and gift it to them. I would‚Äôve been so grateful to my mother in law if she had done that!

OldSchoolCool,fdjb04l,t3_elkous,1578463770.0,I hope she felt as beautiful as she looked. In both photos.
AmItheAsshole,fdfcqgc,t3_ekxcfb,1578358617.0,"YTA- and dumb too. Hair changes over time but mostly,  if she is just learning how to care for her curly hair, it‚Äôs going to take some work. You don‚Äôt understand hair. You don‚Äôt understand HER hair. Apologize to her and admit that you‚Äôre an idiot."
AskReddit,fcv1j07,t3_eixc75,1577992716.0,Met my husband on MySpace in 2007. We dated briefly but he was wanting something more serious and i was 18 and not thinking about marriage at that point. We were friends for a year and then realized that we really did want something more serious with each other. Going on 9 years of marriage!

BeautyGuruChatter,fbimld1,t1_fbilxm2,1576905755.0,"It‚Äôs not, but it‚Äôs MORE of an accurate depiction than when using photoshop or other digital means. As I said. And natural is just filtered sunlight, plenty of people see you throughout the day in filtered sunlight. And that style of lighting shows off your work best, I feel. The colors are more true to life. Nothing looks good under office lights, which is why no one takes pictures of their makeup in office lighting. And by angles, I‚Äôm not talking about MySpace angles, I‚Äôm
talking about minor tweaks to how you hold you shoulders or jaw or even the camera. There are people of all different heights, does that mean you should take a picture at a low angle, to show off your double chin and your nostrils because that‚Äôs the angle in which a child sees you? I‚Äôm all for taking photos showing of the realness of your work, or whatever makes you comfortable. I‚Äôm not okay with the heavy digital editing that gurus are doing, especially because there is never a need for it."
BeautyGuruChatter,fbil8a7,t1_fbic4pr,1576904448.0,"Angles also play a vital role, I‚Äôm not great looking, but I know my angles, and I think I‚Äôm pretty photogenic because of it. Also, natural lighting can be the best thing to ever happen to you. I don‚Äôt edit my photos anymore because I just don‚Äôt care to, but I do make sure to use natural light and work my angles. No harm or shame in it I feel. It‚Äôs more of an accurate description of the work or subject than the people who overly facetune or photoshop and only use studio lighting."

AmItheAsshole,fa87rvb,t3_e7t57k,1575842400.0,"I have 5 1/2 year old twins and a 2 1/2 year old singleton, I love them with every fiber of my being. But Jesus Christ, they just suck my will to live right out of me on a daily basis. I have said it plenty of times that if i could go back and really show my young self what parenthood would be like, that I wouldn‚Äôt do it. I miss my freedom. I miss doing things with my husband that doesn‚Äôt include kids or begging people to babysit. I miss traveling! I miss not having such horrendous anxiety, i worry about them EVERY day which makes me worry about my husband every day because if he dies I am so fucking fucked to be left alone with them. I‚Äôm lucky, he‚Äôs an amazing father that truly takes on more than most men would ever. He loves being home with the kids and me and jumps at an opportunity to take them places. I‚Äôm like, fuck that noise, give me silence and solitude. Then again, I‚Äôm a stay at home mom, so I‚Äôm with the kids the majority of the time. 

Anyway, NTA, at all. I feel like at this specific age, it‚Äôs hard. The ages are hard, and one of them is special needs on top of it. And if your partner isn‚Äôt acting like a partner and is just setting up against you, then why would t you resent it all? Fuck your wife for telling your kid too, that is just horrendous. 

Also, my sisters 5 year old has ODD and has been kicked out of preschool after preschool. He‚Äôs finally doing slightly better in kindergarten. But for a while there he would strip down naked and take a crap on the floor in his preschool whenever he was raging. So...I feel you on the ODD, it. Is. Awful. I hope your son outgrows it or gets some good help soon."
