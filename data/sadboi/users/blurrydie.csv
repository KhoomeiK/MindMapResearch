I think that especially in america bipolar is way overdiagnosed and usually what they think of bipolar is actually boirderline. 

Plus: Bipolar mania also affects your entire thinking in a whole different different way to the point of you having delusions and psychosis which people with borderline do not have, therefore it's easier to forgive a bipolar person during mania."

Responding to edit

I  never said I was abusing myself more than anyone else, but I said that  not allowing yourself to feel emotions is incredibly bad for you and I  think crying is a great stress relief, or at leats that was my  standpoint from the start was that it's not abusive ( but since so many  people seem to disagree with me, then maybe i'm wrong) ed:

>. They shouldn’t have to feel that way at all. You’re the only one that has the power to stop that.

and  on this, can you be more specific on what you're talking about? Do you  mean i'm the only one that has the power to stop the way they're feeling  and that I'm the only, or the way I feeling?"
BPD,fqi0qua,t1_fqhzwy5,1589387858.0,"Well, sometimes people can't really control their crying and they shouldn't be punished for it.It's a great way for the body to release stress and you don't have to do it in front of another person.

edit: forgot an y lol"
BPD,fqgboq5,t1_fqg1tt9,1589342311.0,"Ok, honestly, I agree with your post a lot, but I still don't think crying should count as emotional abuse. I think it's great that we can take responsibility for our actions and make sure we're not hurting people, but this is just being too hard on ourselves, sometimes crying is a much better way to let out or emotions than the alternatives."
