Watchmen,fqene5h,t1_fqecfkf,1589310440.0,"Laurie, I suppose, had the most wiggle room for writing as her character arc seemed complete to me by the end of the comic. As you said, it’s probably just my biased towards that type of writing for a character. You make a good point in regards to Ozy getting loopy in isolation, but for me personally it just didn’t feel in line with him. 
I forgot Looking Glass was the one who hit him, but it’s the same end result of a cartoonish moment. 
I think I would’ve been better with the white supremacists villains if it were handled more subtle or gracefully than a bunch of hicks wearing Rorschach’s mask and quoting him word for word. It just felt like the writers hitting me over the head with a copy of the graphic novel. 

As for doctor Manhattan, he felt thrown in just to use that iconography (*as the show had already done plenty of times such as the single drop of blood on the police badge in the first episode, Rorschach’s “I will whisper no” being regurgitated verbatim, the nazis wearing the ink blot mask, the suicide capsule etc etc*). He felt unnecessary to the plot to me, even though the Cal plot twist was set up, and they could’ve done the same villains/doomsday device without him. Again it felt like just cashing in on recognizable iconography by having him do his “*it is March 20. It is April 1. It is January 12*” type speech (*the Doomsday Clock comic is MISERABLE with that when they introduce Doc*). 
I suppose out of all the returning characters he felt the most in line with Moore’s writing(indifferent, nihilistic, emotionally distant), but again, it felt like he was just thrown in because it’s doctor Manhattan and fans recognize him."

Watchmen,fqcboc6,t1_fqc6u72,1589254366.0,"Ok, I agree with most of what you said, except for your last paragraph.

 For my money, it actively did NOT respect the source material.  Ozy didn’t feel at all like the same character in the comic and HBO show. The way he acted and was written by Lindelof was mind bogglingly inconsistent with the comic.  Veidt was a brilliant, proud and cunning man, which I suppose he was to a degree in the show, but mostly he was an insane goofball for Lindelof to give a strange, plot-twist B-plot to. In that way he disrespected the character of Ozymandias. Same with Laurie. Lindelof turned her into a cheap Marvel movie character rip off where she just spouted one liners every time she was on screen and arrested Ozy by hitting him on the head like Looney Tunes. In that way he disrespected the character of Laurie.  The writing was poor, in my opinion (though that’s subjective) with Lindelof’s trademark silly, odd, sci fi elements that worked beautifully in Lost and The Leftovers, but fell short for me with Watchmen.  The Lube Man character is in one scene for what seems like a joke and then never discussed again. Rorschach was a far right character, sure, but the logical next step wouldn’t be for his followers to become white supremacists. Conspiracy theorists, sure, anti government radicals, absolutely, but it’s a far leap from conservative to white supremacist.  Lindelof said in an interview that racial tension is today’s equivalent of the Cold War. So writing evil, hand wringing villains into the show was really just pandering to make it a modern story. In that way, he disrespected the character of Rorschach. 

Watchmen was all about grey morality. Ozymandias did horrible things, but for the greater good of all mankind. Doctor Manhattan was more of a “hero” and was disgustingly apathetic. Rorschach was arguably the main protagonist and had some vile opinions and world views. In this series the enemies are literal nazis with a doomsday device and the heroes are cops dressing up like superheroes. That’s about as simplistically black and white as it gets. Ham fisted where the comic was subtle. In that way he disrespected Moore’s message of morality in the source material. 

I am all for people adding to a mythology, writers interpreting things their own way and adding their own spin to a piece of media. Comics wouldn’t be comics without that (as you said). Moore and Gibbons expanded on the source material where as I feel this show was a step back in writing quality.  What I do take issue with is someone taking a masterpiece, writing the characters inconsistently and turning it into something silly, goofy and ham fisted where the original is clever, subtle and mostly serious."
Watchmen,fqc15b0,t1_fqb87kj,1589247978.0,That’s what I love about Ozy and Doc. They’re both sort of mirror images of each other with Ozy doing the wrong things for the right reasons and Doc being more traditionally heroic (well...) but he’s completely indifferent for most of the story.

This was my first Moore read, and I realize that deconstructing comics is common for him, but at the time (and still really) I was flabbergasted. I think Ozymandias has got to be my favorite simply because of how genius he was. Best scene in comics as far as I’m concerned."
criterion,fq89t9k,t1_fq85afn,1589161427.0,"I mean...my favorites are American, but I watched close to 100 films last year and minored in cinema studies in college. Also I would consider everything Bong Joon Ho and Alphonso Cuaron make to be masterpieces. Also over the past few years I’ve been making my way through Lars Von Trier, Gaspar Noe and Nicholas Winding Refn’s filmographies.  I have more to watch, but I’ve seen a few Kurosawa and Tarkovsky films and think they’re  glorious. I’ve seen a handful of Tornatore’s work, I think he’s a bit hit or miss, but when he’s good he’s good. I also love Taika Waitit’s stuff (and I’m talking about Boy and Hunt for the Wilderpeople NOT just Thor 3) and I thought Cold War was one of the best movies of 2018.

 Honestly, over the past few years about 60% of what I watch ISN’T American.

Also season 3 really sidelined most of the characters and all but eliminated the kids. John and Michael were so much more interesting to me in S2. 

Also love season 1, but tonally it feels like a different series from 2&3. 

Season 2 was the best balance of weird insanity and top notch writing. For me at least.  I like that it focused on all the characters we knew and loved from the first season, but added John and his family/and they were all interesting and contributed to the series as a whole. Matt’s story was at its best in S2 as well."

Most of Matt’s scene stole the show for me as well.  Christopher Eccleston was perfect as Matt, and I love the Lindelof trope of ‘religious man with tumultuous relationship w/God’
SPECIFICALLY the scene playing ‘Laughing With’ while Matt is punishing himself because he’s suspects he may have possibly molested his wife. Such a charged and emotional scene (and I didn’t believe for a second Matt would do that).

Also both episodes of Kevin visiting the afterlife. I love the concept of the afterlife (or limbo at least) being an alternate reality. Kevin with lil Patty at the well was a beautiful scene and President Kevin ripping Solid Snake Kevin’s chest open w/‘God Only Knows’ playing was oddly touching."

For Wind Waker: 

•Rito and Koroks are only a species included in WW and BOTW

•Korok living with the Deku Tree

•Rito Village’s theme interpolates Dragonroost Island’s music

•Beedle looking almost identical to his WW counterpart and having the same job. 

•King of Hyrule looks almost identical to his WW counterpart (though to be fair, the king always looks similar in design)

•I believe the description for rock salt mentions ‘the ancient sea’

•The korok leaf is a returning item only seen in both games (w/the paraglider acting in the same way the leaf did in WW)

For Twilight Princess: 

•the region names are included 

•there’s a side mission with a broken stone tablet on the beach that strongly resembles the Twilight Mirror (and apparently if you use the Wolf Link Amiibo and have Wolf Link w/you, he refuses to look at the stone).

•Zelda references the chosen hero being associated with the embers of twilight. 

A Link to the Past:

•the Master Sword being in a pedestal in The Lost Woods felt like a callback to that game. 

•one of the coastal islands is named Koholit (like Koholint from LA)

I’m sure there’s more, but these were just the ones I picked up on. To me, it seems the evidence points towards WW/The Adult Timeline, but Nintendo doesn’t seem interested in placing it on the timeline."
