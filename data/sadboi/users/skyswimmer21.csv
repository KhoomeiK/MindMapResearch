greenville,fki8s0f,t3_fimnht,1584214300.0,"The state has one, however. Roads are generally places on a priority list for repaving- this pic is of a state road (white lines =state roadways). State roads, even when prioritized by cities or counties, have to be prioritized by the SCDOT. 
Grants are distributed for patching at a much faster and higher amount than repaving since most repaving projects require engineering, and most of the time, removal of the former roadbed. 
The road in the pic looks to be prior to new standards established in 2010. 
SC DOT estimates for roadway construction as of last July were at 1.5M per mile. Patching eliminates the ‚Äúsafety‚Äù hazard as per state guidelines. 
You can check the DOT website for state road improvements by map or by county (list).

That also looks to be a bridge, which would add another million right off the bat. Overpaving the existing asphalt may tease the weight limit of the structure, too."
