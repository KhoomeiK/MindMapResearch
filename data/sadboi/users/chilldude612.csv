askphilosophy,fmbx4zf,t3_fu486t,1585934836.0,"First off I dont believe in morals. I believe in ethics.
Morals are religious based.

I've been studying psychology philosophy enlightenment metaphysics and quatuamn physics for over a decade... the general understanding over all if you are really free thinker and dont hold firm to one idealogy is this.

Regardless of what organism you speak of nature is a create and destroy living organism that we live in.
We are no different to nature as a whole as the bacteria in your gut. We all play interact rolls so nature stays alive. If one things dies off the their is another system that can compensate for the lack of or the death of an item in the environment.  Yes If your heart dies (air) the whole system fails (mammals die)
But the environment still lives. Your body for example will break down and replenish the ground around it and let say for giggles  your heart attack results into a tree.

Morally that just sound terrible. Ethnically it is what it is.

If humans die many plants animals will live. there was a video about what would life be like 50 years after humanity's just disappear. Spoiler the earth is fine. Atm you can google the earth is healing becuz of the Corona virus. Lakes rivers and air are clearing up.

If my death is so important the death of the other 115 billion people that lived are just as important. 
We from the begin started off as just a few people and now there is billions of us. We only need a handful of humans to keep humanity on this planet.

I would say this... from a human perspective this coronavirus is terrible  for a tree or animal perspective  this humans are killing us by the billions. We are going extinct becuz of human.

My hippie said say nature works it self and if we die we die my ego said said this pandemic is the worst things for humans and all our pets.

As scientists would say it's in the cards. The chances of a virus killing people in mass is inevitable. 

Humans and ants and other social beings are the main species that get virus. Birds aren't very socail that's why they carry virus but dont die from them.  Virus mutated specifically towards a specific group of being on earth. And those are mainly social animals.

schizophrenia,fmagrds,t3_fu2p5v,1585893608.0,"Well two things
One idk you so it's hard to tell if this is a delusion like issue of being paranoid or you flat out have terrible doctors.

Schizophrenia in general is a very specific condition.
The sub categories are very vague sometimes.

Like If u hear voices and see stuff constantly and they aren't cuz u are having an episode of psychosis 
You most likely have some form of Sz.

I'd honestly take a deep honest look at your self.
Look at major websites that say the signs and effects of Schizophrenia and say yes I really have that.

Then write those SYMPTOMS down and bring them to a doctor 

Arguing with doctors is like just fight a while

schizophrenia,fmag0kj,t3_ftudmv,1585892910.0,"Its partially an historic phenomenon and even present day naturally action.

Meaning.. it doesn't matter what culture or tribe you go to the crazy person is kicked out. Doesn't where you go in history or on this planet now a days.

People also forget it's the worst mental illness u can have, plus it's in 1% of the population plus 10% of Sz kill the self.. plus many of us are to crazy to even speak about it for anyone to understand it or we are so delusional even other Sz cant even understand what they are saying.

Think about it like this... on this board we have 100s If not 1000s of Schizophrenics. The conversation are usually vague or u hear the same advice over and over again.
Plus some of us are to scared or paranoid to even type something that know 100% about.
So it leaves only a hand full of us on good days to talk and explain what the fuck is happening in our heads. Then eventually we fall back into our episdoe.

Plus the post we post are very triggering to each other. 

So it's like 10% of schizophrenics can even talk about it. But most of us are all hurt by people and doctors or we are so zombied out by our meds.... 
That Its hard to get any support in our own community.


So ya.. there is a famous lady making schizophrenia like a well known illness but she is so PC and fake about it I kinda think shes now doing it for the fame.

To be fair.. we live in a  walking nightmare that's customized to us, that makes us hate the things we love. Plus we hear intelligent voices that tell us things we dont know. Plus some of our hallucinations are so fucked up that serial killers couldn't think them up.

Then we for people with happy voices but they dont realize that having voices distract you from your own life. If even they saying I love you and giving you happy feelings.

So you want to make people see what we see.
Well you have to prove doctors are jerks
Nurses are jerks
Psychward hurt us more then they help u
And there are some really good doctors and nurses 
Plus u gotta prove big pharm wrong.
Plus tell people we hear voices that can predict the future....


Idk how to prove to my friends that I'm not crazy and they accept schiz as a real thing...

Like it's hard to get support when it's so rare so stigmatized and the people who have it cant speak clearly about what is happening. 

An hour ago I was dealing with voices so bad I couldn't even look at a closet.

And if u look at the comments our response are very deep but very reactive and very less interactive.

Plus plus most doctors frown on supplements and other holistic cures...  I say once mental illness is seen over all as a real problem that is spooky and scary I think schizophrenia will go down in stigmatization.

Remember this sad fact... we live in a world where people dont care kids strave... we live in a world that Money runs everything.
We live in. Culture that violence is played on TV movies and in newspapers and the people read it and see it are addicted to it."

She just wants the stigma to go away but on false terms... long term shes hurting us."
OCD,flzvhdc,t1_flzo5wx,1585634863.0,"In short yes they can see that you are washing your hand so much that a trained doctor will realise that your mental illness is so severe u can not stop.

I'll respond back later to the rest.

Ponder this though..
I had OCD severe levels where If I didnt wash my hands I'd have to commit suicide or some crazy thing would happen.

Now I was my hands all the time cuz of the Corona virus and dont even think once about if I dont wash my hands right xyz will  happen.

A normal person  can do what is considered to us a compulsion 2000x time and never  even think about why or get anxiety 

Aka it's a state of mind not the actions

So yes u can get over ur OCD hand washing and wash your hands during the Corona virus"
schizophrenia,flzv2ky,t3_fs75bx,1585634486.0,"It's called Stockholm syndrome.
You fall in love with your captor.
You feel in love with being locked in fear
You got a weird masochistic (link fetish boner) to your extreme illness 

What you forget is a healthy life is 10x more rewarding.

Drug addicts who do a lot of dmt or powerful psychedelics love the connection to the universe. They get outside info that ties back into there life.  It's like magic.

Insanity and genius go hand in hand

To be blunt your being dumb.
I have the high form of schizophrenia.  The worst the lock you in a psychward tied to a bed type.
I am not in the hospital becuz I ditch the I love being crazy act and got help. I see terror all day long. The worst nightmares the worst voices hourly for years. 

To be a person who had the severe version of what you got and to hear you say you want worse is like this
It's like saying this (you) I have an sti I have crabs. But I want aids.. i want HIV.

Outside looking in you got some balls to say that.
But I've been there. I get it i felt it.
I would say this 
Write plan about what is a health life for you
Like type kid TV shows or music is listen to
The type of hobbies you would enjoy doing
The type of conversation you would have with family and friends

Then write a list of the type of life with your ideal mental Illness worst case scenario 
Like the crazy connections 
The convos would have with your family and friends
The music you would listen to

Then just stare at both list

Then either do two things

Go get help or smoke some meth 
The meth will create a quick break down In your mind so u can active this crazy state you claim u desire

The get help will let you walk down the street with smile on your face.

Remember I got what u got and would dream to have low SYMPTOMS like you.  Your delusions u describe are like omg so much easier then my daily life.  But doesn't mean I want those delusion 

I am happy you are honest
Many people like us dont admit or Express they enjoy their crazy.

schizophrenia,flyxhmz,t3_frir9n,1585611108.0,"A little kid gets murdered in all different ways dozens of times an hour or ever 4 hours.
Shits so gross.
Plus being told I am that kids dad and every action I do is why the kid dies.
If I close a door, the kids hands gets crush then get shot in the head.
Then I hear the kid say I my dad.

Name a horror movie I've seen it in my eyes.

I get tactile hallucinations too where I feel where the kid get shot. Or my emotion change instantly where it feels like I just someone die. Like I'll he happy calm then my gut will feel like I've been crying over someone I loved died 2 hours ago.

My hands feel like been it's been cut off

I see people stabbing me,
I see peoples head blowing up when I take to them

My thoughts are changed mind thought.i will think about something like sledding then mid thought my thought will change. Example I am going sledding down hill dow. . . On bloody hill..

Shit happens all day.

I am diagnosed with one of the worst form of schiz though..

I can work part time and most people dont even know I have depression."
OCD,flyx99m,t1_flydskb,1585610971.0,"You forget OCD is a thought issue where you are forced to deal with a trigger all day.

You can face your fears all day, but that OCD voice will still there. 

Coping skills that are healthy. 
distractions TV music 
Get so involved in something that you forget the world exist.

Be socail..
Get a part time job
Have structure. Brush teeth, clip nails once per week.
Do the same thing 2 mins everyday.
Study
Art
Walk
Sometime jerk off.. so relaxing 
Day dream
Researcher cures.

Learn verbal techniques that chill you at.
Like coming up a  a good definition of a delusion that makes sense to you in a specific situation then wrap all that into a one word  statment  or short phrase."

Did a 30 year study of schizophrenics around the world (the agenda was to promote medication)

forcing anyone to take meds is dumb. Saying they need treatment or therapy or to be in a padded cell is a little more ethical."

To say it bluntly.
You are being terrible to your self.
You are hurting yourself
By you washing your hands always...
You are preventing your immune system to build resistance to every day bacteria which results into you become sick.
You are destroying your body, you are hurting yourself. The end. 

The hospital was my wake up call to how sick and crazy insane I was.
It takes awhile to re correct my habit.

Yes this covid virus makes you wash your hands more but to the degree where you gotta clean your house over and over, wash your hands to the point they are dry and cracking. Unless you have extremely sensitive skin.

OCD is basically a thought you are forced to deal with over and over. It's like its screaming in your head 
To for example..to wash your hands or anxiety fear.

Think about this... if you ended up homeless.
You couldn't wash your hands, shower 10x a day
You would be forced to deal with your anxiety aka OCD
You yes would snap and get all omfg but you would adapt.

OCD is lack of self control of anxiety. 
Many people facing compulsions just cant handle 
Not doing the rituals and just crying and being scared.
Therapy like exposure therapy gently force you to stop doing your ritual to a degree where you can walk into the forest eventually for a day and not even notice how dirty your hands are and you can think wow I had blast camping hiking and chilling by a lake.

Its easier to say then type...
I had severe OCD like psychward level crazy of thinking too.. but over time I learned to stop doing my rituals. 

Here's a reality check  for you... schizophrenia is like OCD on crack meth 1000x of heroin plus million shots of more crazy 

If you ask a schizophrenic about your gem problem they laugh and say that's it.. lol ponder that.

I say this cuz schizophrenia is like OCD big mean parent.

Yes the worse mental illness is your mental illness but
Most people cant let them self break and hide in the delusions.. and can face reality
Once I stopped my rituals did the voice in my head go away. But I could live. I could wake over a crack and not worry I destroyed my life. If something bad happened after I didnt do a ritual I was aware enough to be able to realize hey life or something bad was gonna happen based on out side events.

And If you do have OCD...
No if you dont wash your hands u didnt cause covid 19 or cause wars or someone dying...its just a delusion

I have a good support group, I tend to be the person helping my friends. 

My only other suggestion is to talk to them in a comforting manner where u use analogies and metaphors that they can agree with. Then you add a similar analogy that is a different perspective that relates the schizophrenia or mental illness."
