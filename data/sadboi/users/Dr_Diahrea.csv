I gotta work on wording things better i guess. To be honest, i am a white dude, but outside of not being followed by mall security for my skin color and shit like that, i really dont think its fair to say im privelaged. I've been through abuse and hunger just like anyone else on my economic level, my skin color has never saved me from that. I get dirty as looks from old white people too, and i fucking hate it. I dont want to hate anybody at all, not for trivial reasons anyway. Sure i guess its easy for me to say skin color shouldn't matter when i haven't been oppressed because of mine, but that doesn't mean i haven't dealt with oppression for other reasons like my depression and adhd or just what clothes i wore in high school. Sorry for coming at you like that, i just really am trying to say i hate hearing about trump man, i think its an easy think to  write about and it pulls me out of the joy i have for things. Its immersion breaking. 

I dont give a shit what color skin a character has, or what gender they are, but when they only ever talk about that as the characters personality type like thats good writing, it kind of ruins it. I love powerful female characters, but when they spend the whole time they're on screen bitching about men and opression it just doesn't come off as good writing. Anyway thanks for being cool, my bad for ranting so much, i start and keep going lol, it gets old.

Im tired of hearing about trump. There are ways to put political topics in everything and some of them do it really well. Some of them do it in a way that goes over like a lead balloon with 0% originality or creativity. Shitting on trump is easy, but crafting a narrative that resembles something in our current climate takes a bit of effort and you can tell when they put in the effort. I just have a feeling that the T virus will be because trump hates china or some shit like that and they wont even fucking try. 

There are so many shows that handle topics well with class and make you think about it in a different way. Dystopic scifi and cyperpunk are great at making you look at the issues with capitalism in new and even more horrifying ways. That show i mentioned, they literally blamed nukes falling on trump tweeting like a jackass and that's why the world ended and kids were living in a zombie infested wasteland.

They have a zombie show thats relatively new about kids surviving the apocalypse and not 10 minutes into the first episode they just couldn't help but talk about trump for some reason.

Go play something else then and stop supporting them if you dont like the direction they're going. 

I've been playing since 3 and i have to say the last two game are better in every way. They're more fun to play, the controls are nicer and much smoother. Climbing is no longer a chore, its actually kind of fun. Unity was ok despite the glitches, and the brutal physical combat of syndicate was great, but i wouldnt say they're better. The older games are great for setting the franchise up and making it a big name, but by the standard of action combat/stealth games today they're practically unplayable.

The free-running in all games prior to origins was just tye worst, most freedom restricting system and im glad its gone. Just hold the button and the character (barely) does all of the movement for you. The new games, Odyssey especially, have a newfound level of freedom and combat enjoyment that I would be quite frankly ashamed of them if they got rid of to revert back to the ""real"" games of the past; just to please a few bitter fans like you. 

This is all my opinion btw, im sure the old games were great when they were great, but compared to the new gameplay style, they're shit tier."
