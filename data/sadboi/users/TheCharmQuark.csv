PhD,flwssny,t3_frlv21,1585563745.0,"I feel you completely. Another UK PhD currently doing the last bits of research and writing up. I was supposed to have a first draft by the end of June. My supervisor is locked down in Italy.  


My situation is weird: I work from home sometimes, so I'm used to it and able to do it. However, I have to be on campus to access certain things that are central to my research, and I need books that are locked away in an office that I can't get into.

&#x200B;

It's bad enough being at the end of my PhD, and facing funding running out in September. I already have mental health issues, and can't go to therapy any more, so I've lost some key sources of support. I'm an introvert who cancels stuff all the time, so the pressure to pretend to be normal is off my shoulders, because we're all living like I prefer, but this is a really bad time to suddenly not be able to access essential things.

The transition was incredibly hard. Our university gave us about four hours between announcing they were shutting down and actually closing everything. I didn't have the chance to get things, and had everything - a lecture, two conferences and two workshops, one of which I had organised and set up - was suddenly cancelled.

I spent all last week working so hard. I wrote 8k words in five days. Now I feel a bit broken. It's hard to work when everything is up in the air. We have appeals to the UKRI to offer automatic extensions because we can't do anything, but nothing has been decided yet. We might not be able to get work next year.

Dealing with mental health issues my whole life gives me a bit of an advantage. I know I have to do my running, exercise, meditate. And these external things I can't control, I can just put them down. But there's a kind of constant, grinding anxiety because things are so different, since things that were once straightforward are now really uncertain.

I was due to do an exam in May/June, and I'm desperately hoping they cancel the whole thing and let me off the hook. There is a tendency in academia to see every difficult thing as an opportunity to just work harder. I broke my ankle and was told that since that meant I had to sit down all the time I would have more time to work. Now we're being told we have more time to be productive. There is no sense that the atmosphere we're living in could be making it hard to work and concentrate.

Upside: I have a routine that I'm familiar with, and my partner working at home as well helps. We talk about how we're feeling, and keep diaries about it. Get up, make coffee, work for a bit, stop when it gets hard. Go for a run, do a workout, do a meditation, mix it up throughout the day. Not watching the news all the time is hard but the answer is noticing the urge, and letting pass. And if you can't do that, then consciously allow yourself to look at the news so you can process how it makes you feel.

The Unf\*ck Your Brain podcast is doing a series on how to manage your mind in the midst of all this. That might help people who need it. I feel for all of us, as this is incredibly stressful and all we're getting from the university right now is ""Here, join our Shut Up And Write"" sessions, and isn't it great!"" stuff, which is not helpful."

PhD,f6bneur,t3_dqvqdw,1572775925.0,"Yes, I've definitely been through this battle a number of times. You're not lame, you're human. We've all been there. Here's what I do:

1. Set a time when you plan to write. Make it clear what you intend to do (intro, planning, writing a section), and make sure there's an end time planned out.
2. During the time you are meant to write you may do three things: 1. write; 2. do NOTHING; 3. write out all the thoughts you get around writing the paper.
3. Nothing means NOTHING. Sit and stare at the screen or piece of paper. Don't go and do something else.
4. If you choose to write out your feelings, this can be really helpful. Your thoughts are frightening and huge, but as real as they are, they are just thoughts. You've already identified a key reason why you're not writing: if you don't, you don't have to experience a painful feeling from rejection. We think rejection is huge, we take it very personally. But it isn't personal. It's just that this time, it wasn't right. You can move on.
5. At the end of the time, go and do something else, probably something to take care of yourself.

I do this every time I have to write and feel like I can't. It can be really helpful for isolating what's going on in your head and getting it out. You can also do a 'fear-setting' exercise with your fear of rejection to isolate the worst thing that would happen if you got rejected. You can isolate actions to take to deal with those events. Usually, just seeing that you're actually afraid that you'll die or you'll never get published, can help you move on. Facing the fears gently and taking care of yourself while you work will help you get there. You can do this."

During that time, you may do one of three things:

1. Write.
2. Do nothing. You may not get up, go get a coffee, otherwise procrastinate. Sit and do NOTHING. Eventually you'll end up doing 1 or 3. Probably 3 first, then eventually 1.
3. Brain dump all your thoughts about writing, preferably long-hand but typing is almost as good, for the duration.

Rinse, repeat. Schedule regular times to do this. Even if you end up writing ""I don't know I don't know"" a billion times. You can get angry, you can get sad. All of it. 

It's not going to be pleasant at all, but I found this a very effective means of doing thought work to get myself back into writing. Get the 17 year old out on paper for as long as she needs the attention."

PhD,eytjidl,t1_eytiqo0,1567438209.0,"Yes, it can be absolutely maddening. When it comes down to it job requirements and desirable skills are all wishlist items the employer wants to have, plus a whole lot of things they want subconsciously but don't really know they want.

That makes it incredibly difficult for applicants to judge whether they should apply for things. I've been given jobs without critical hard skills because I had the soft skills that the people with the hard skills didn't have. People often get called for interviews when they don't have essential skills because the employers are trying to gauge whether something else might compensate for that.

I got my PhD place without having Ancient Greek, but I had to do an exam in it to prove I could do it. I think a lot of this comes down to persistence, and something 'clicking' in the interview room, so that when you show up they decide they want you rather than whoever else. And that usually is something really difficult to quantify.

None of that helps you, unfortunately. I would look at some research assistant posts, and keep on trying. You can do a PhD at any age, and 40 isn't as close to death as people often think ;-)"

PhD,eytfzfx,t3_cypamo,1567435556.0,"**How did you come to decide on a program/institution?**

I've always loved the Ancient World and History, and I was interested in exploring ancient languages. My university is local to me (we have three universities in the area), and I'd completed a Masters here.

**Did you choose your program because it was exactly the area you wanted to work with? Was it adjacent or dead on or were you simply qualified for it so you took what you could get?**

We have a library with a very large collection of papyri, many of which haven't been studied. And it turns out, a museum with a lot of unpublished objects that I now work with. I think this question applies more to STEM PhDs, because I wrote my own proposal, and this is my own project.

**How long did it take for you to get into the program you went with/find the right program for you?**

I didn't have any difficulties. I applied in the January as I was finishing my Masters thesis, and was offered a place in February. By April I had two offers of full funding.

**Did you apply before knowing any of the professors you would work with or did you contact them before applying to let them know you were interested in their work and was considering applying?**

I had worked with my supervisor before, as she was my Masters thesis supervisor. We discussed what I wanted to do and she helped me write my proposal.

**Where did you do/are you doing your PhD? Was/is it full-time or do you work elsewhere too? What is your monthly pay/compensation/allowence (if any)?**

I sidled in by accident. Like you, I love ancient Egypt but ended up doing Geography for my first degree and PhD (long story why that happened).

When I came back to academia, I did a Masters in Classics and discovered an area of research - Greco-Roman Egypt - that allowed me to do archaeology and material culture as well as languages for the later period of Egyptian history.

As our department merged with Archaeology and Egyptology, I've been able to do a PhD that straddles all the disciplines. I am doing background research on Ancient Egypt, as it is important to have that foundation. I think it's doable, and there might be ways you can fit it in to what you've done so far. My friend did a Masters in Egyptology after doing a Biology BSc, because our Egyptology department had a heavy focus on the scientific side. You could try that route.

Aside: A lot of people say don't go into the humanities, there are no jobs. According to our Careers Service research, so many people are being told to do STEM and not humanities that there's now far less competition for posts, while in STEM it's a nightmare and very competitive.

And using willpower is a drain on your mental resources, so if you're having to use it to keep going throughout a long run, it can be even more exhausting, just when depression is making it tough to do anything.

I agree with all the rest of the advice given, but my take is slightly different. Could you look at your thoughts around what counts as a good run, what meets your standards? Is it possible to shift your standards, to tell the part of you that feels you're not doing well enough that this is a time when you're ill and you need to take it steady?

I would definitely try recalibrating your goals and expectations. I've actually done this, and am doing this over the summer. I treat running as a self-care, mental health, medicine. It can be really hard work, but shifting from ""This 5k was too slow and too hard"" to ""I was feeling really unwell, and I didn't want to do it, but I did it anyway"" can be so effective."

You're fine. You have a bunch of publications under your belt and now might well be a good time to focus on your thesis.

It might be worth asking for some clarification if you feel you're doing fine on the thesis. However, one thing to bear in mind is that these people have been in academia a long time and know what you'll be facing in the final years. Even part time it is going to get pretty tough. I generally side in favour of my supervisor's advice, since she is wise in the ways of the academy and how to get through it in one piece."

I have enjoyed this experience much more than the first time around, probably because I've already learnt a lot of the basic transferable skills you need.

running,exkda4y,t3_cszns6,1566385258.0,"Yes. I'm going to do a 7 miler in the autumn and as my dad says, since my main distance is half-marathon, this will be like a training run. I'll be running that race with him too.

I got back into running seriously this spring, and I've been doing two 10ks a week, plus a 6-7k and then a long run at the weekend. You have plenty of time between the 10k race and the half-marathon to take a smidgen of a break then do the half-marathon.

What I do is train for the half-marathon distance and then use shorter races as training for race day.

Also, your inhaler is a medical device to aid breathing where you have a specific medical condition. As everybody has said, breathing is necessary for running, and you can't do it without."

Can be so useful when you feel stressed but you've run into this situation before."
PhD,exhbech,t3_csvzu0,1566299886.0,"What do YOU WANT to do?

Nobody can advise you, really, other than to say that you need to work out what you really want to do now. And that is actually harder than it sounds, because as we're raised, we are packed full of other people's expectations about what we should want, and what we should be doing. We sometimes end up with the distinct impression that our job is to fulfil other people's expectations, desires, choices. It can take a really long time to find out what we even want even after raking through all of that.

I can't advise you, because I don't know you and I'm not you. In the end, all of us have thoughts in our head about what our PhDs should be like, and what we should or do experience. If we think something is hard, it'll be hard. These are just thoughts. Your PhD and your life will be what you make of it. The sooner you can step back from what other people tell you you should want or do and work out what you want, the easier these tough choices will be.

Bear in mind, this is my second PhD (I'm in the UK). I did one, left academia because I thought it would be too tough, then realised I'd made the wrong choice and came back. Yes, my PhD is incredibly hard, but it's also incredibly rewarding. How I feel about it on any day comes down to what I think about it. But it's all just thoughts. Sometimes I have to take time to work through the thoughts before I can settle down to work.

I would take a look at why you chose to apply in the first place, what you'd like to do with your life generally, and what has made you really get cold feet. And whatever you decide, you can always change your mind if it's not right for you. Life is far less rigid than people would have you believe."
PhD,exhamm6,t1_exh92xz,1566299033.0,"I get that totally. Procrastination is a horrible cycle: you feel like it's too much, so you don't do anything because where do you even start with all of this? and then you feel even more anxious because you haven't done anything, and there's this huge mountain to climb.

I find it helpful to break everything down into process goals. You get a big goal done by doing it in small chunks every day. Much of this technique comes down to ""What do you feel like doing?"" and that can mean spending some time letting out all your feelings about how scary all of this is.

I suffer from CPTSD and depression and anxiety. When I get it really bad, to the point where I can't do anything but feel terrified I'll fail, I do five minutes on, five minutes off. It's the tiniest amount of work, but doing just that gives me the dopamine hit to carry on.

It always helps to go through what you have done, recognising the difficulties you've had to overcome (including not wanting to work). What you do is enough."

PhD,ewyyxwv,t3_cqr8op,1565888858.0,"Could you clarify if this is 1 + 3 (i.e. you do a Research Masters then move on to a PhD for three years) or if you're doing an MPhil/PhD and will have to demonstrate sufficient progress and capability to do a PhD at the end of the first year or you'll be re-routed to an MPhil?

All of this really depends on your field. My first PhD was social sciences/humanities and fees-funded. I applied every year to the ESRC and never made headway.

This PhD is humanities and I am fully funded by the AHRC. I also got offered full funding from a university scholarship, so there are often those options available too.

Advice for applying for research council funding: have a look at relevant proposals by others, as that will help you work out what to write. They will generally want a demonstration of a clear development of interest from undergrad upwards, and will want firsts for everything, from undergraduate on up. The same applied for the scholarships I applied for, but this might be university dependent.

I've never met anybody who got funding for the last few years of their project in either social sciences or humanities, perhaps because the same issues that prevented them getting funding the first time held them up in later years, with the added cost of competing against a new batch of students coming through.

I worked for the last part of my first PhD and honestly I wouldn't recommend it at all. The stress is horrendous, and not being able to rest in the evenings because you have to study takes a real toll. I know people who do it, and they are heroes.

The other option is finding institutions with an interest in your subject and applying to them for funding, depending on whether such organisations exist in your area. I honestly am not sure what the requirements would be there, but they may vary depending on the organisation.

I wish I could be more positive!"

Turns out, what I'm really afraid of is having uncomfortable feelings in response to a set of real-world events. Knowing that, I feel much better. I haven't failed, I don't look stupid, and academics get to say what they like. They aren't necessarily right.

If that doesn't help, write up your supervisor's positive comments somewhere you can see them every day. Then keep looking at them whenever you start to struggle."
PhD,ewxape2,t3_cq8r8s,1565850717.0,"I'm an AHRC funded student and they don't do extensions to funding unless you can demonstrate serious circumstances that prevented you working earlier on the PhD.

However, I passed my panel in the summer so they refused to consider a retroactive extension because it ""clearly hadn't affected the quality of my work"".

Does biomed have such a thing as submission pending? At our university, if you need more time, you enter submission pending, with low fees and up to a year to finish a write up. Of course, this is for arts and humanities students, I've got no idea how that would work for STEM."

Does your panel/committee include an advisor who is there to oversee the work of your supervisors? I have one. He attends all the panels but he's not there to monitor me, but ensure that my supervisors do their job well. If you have one, talk to them.

Otherwise, student support services is the first port of call."

Note: Being unemployed is deeply stressful and is actually a good excuse for not necessarily working on your second draft. 

One alternative is to brain dump before you start. Write honestly about what you're going through, confront your feelings and your fears, and use it as a means to move forward. Set limits: 750 words (there's even a website, [750words.com](https://750words.com), which I highly recommend), or three handwritten pages. If you don't, it can be unhelpful."
PhD,ewudis1,t3_cq70dg,1565776386.0,"Yes. I am a registered disabled student with long term mental health problems. Initially, my supervisor didn't really 'get' having mental health issues, but over the course of working with her for my Masters thesis, I became confident that she was the right person for me.

She has been nothing but supportive. I've had a number of issues come up, including being severely depressed at the beginning of this year. Because I am honest with her, she has a good sense of what kind of support I need. Part of this may be because I've always consistently produced good work and aim to do my best, even if my best on any particular day isn't that awesome.

My illness this year has been so harsh I also let our PGR support advisor know, and my whole panel has been incredibly supportive. We have discussed strategies for healthcare management in panels, and this openness has made it much easier to work because I don't have the anxiety of being afraid people will find out.

I suspect a lot of responses to this will be that you shouldn't discuss mental health issues with anybody, because there is a lingering stigma over it. It is considered to be a weakness, and a lot of PhD students worry that their supervisors will view them as not being strong enough to do a PhD, that they should be able to tough it out. I suspect that might be a bigger issue in countries other than the UK. I've found the environment in my department to be nothing but supportive.

I tend to think that being open and honest is the best way forward. If you're already depressed, it's only going to get worse if you add the terror of what might happen if you can't work, and can't give an honest account of why you're not getting work done. I think each case is different, and will depend on the attitude of your supervisor toward mental health issues.

One of the things that can happen if you do discuss these issues with your supervisor is that it deepens the relationship, and that can be really helpful for progressing in academia. When it's not kept secret, when you're not constantly putting on a front, the relationships you develop have an added depth. The advice and support you get are better, tailored better to your own needs. Supervisors often have great strategies for managing difficult periods.

I may be insanely lucky - I've already got a PhD and I've found ways to make sure my work is of a high enough standard throughout the last two years - but I'm incredibly grateful to my supervisor for all her support and guidance."
PhD,ewquypn,t3_cpjysv,1565680347.0,"I've noticed a lot of people here discussing this very subject, and I've talked about it a lot with my fellow PhDs.

Bear in mind, I've done a PhD before so a lot of the things that you have to learn as a PhD student (time management, fast and effective reading, discerning what to do when etc), I've already done. I also have a chronic illness to manage alongside having an adult life with house, cat, bills, chores.

I often feel like I'm not doing enough, because I'm deliberately not working evenings and weekends. I see friends saying ""Oh, I don't work late, I stop at 8pm"". I wouldn't work after 5pm and I mostly stop earlier than that. I've passed every one of my panels and my supervisors are happy with my work.

I'm starting to think that this tendency to work very long hours is more about anxiety around doing enough, being good enough, and a feeling that somehow working all the hours will compensate from a thought that our work isn't good enough.

But in your viva, you will not be asked how many hours you worked (unless your work is seriously substandard). You won't get a PhD on the basis that you worked every single hour you were conscious.

We do better work when we take frequent breaks. PhDs even in sciences require time to think up solutions, connections, and all that is intense creative work. A lot of my PhD time is spent going on walks to think about a problem I have. That counts as work.

I'm on schedule to finish on time, with 33k of a 60k thesis written and entering my third year. I don't do weekends, I don't do late nights even when I'm in a writing phase. I tend to do 45 minutes on, 15 minutes off. If my mind wanders, I pick tasks that don't require high intensity concentration."
