E.g. hygiene and skin care and kempt hair and stuff. Also working out can make you feel extremely refreshed and make you look damn good. Also buying treats for yourself. Don't take the Mick but like going to buy yourself a donut or fast food like ""yeah u deserve it""  and practising skills or interests. For example I'm in love with history and my friends call me nerd and stuff but I feel awesome knowing about the past."

mentalhealth,fpcvjlc,t3_gcdan4,1588513838.0,Try and surround yourself with loved ones and genuine friends. Having other people encourage you to keep going helps more than you think.
mentalhealth,fpcvfwn,t3_gcqskk,1588513764.0,Well if this helps good but sorry if not. What may help you is making a routine for the day. Try get a bedtime and an alarm and have some activities set out for the day e.g. workout and stuff or practice a skill or something. Just having an organized schedule will help you kind of get your head in the game and if you implement medicine in it then you can do that too. For me I should try do something similar but as a 16 year old don't have much to do so I workout; look at history and walk dogs etc.
mentalhealth,fpbi3a9,t3_gc2f8g,1588470517.0,It truly is. But you can't wait around forever for it to improve. I just want you to know there is one person here who sends love and support. But try your best to find meaning in life. Purpose is what can liberate you
MentalHealthSupport,fp6rctj,t3_gbitrc,1588357270.0,"Hey buddy I want you to know that you're appreciated and I hope your family holds on tight because family is one of the things you never want to lose, thoughts and prayers your way. üôè"
mentalhealth,fof3rix,t3_g72tar,1587724969.0,"I'm in the same boat, I feel like I'm genuinely struggling and want to seek help after lockdown but I'm 16 and not sure if people would believe me but I'm having trouble letting go of the past as well as what someone else believes is anxiety I would like to sort out my problems but have no idea if I'll actually get help or not. It just seems like it's not worth it after running it through my head and I should just move on by myself."

MentalHealthSupport,fny4ig1,t3_g4bpfk,1587353213.0,"I have had a very difficult time dealing with things. It feels like my life is derailed train that fell off a cliff. I've had to deal p both of my parents suffering with cancer (pop got it worst) among other things that have been bothering me and the worst part is I'm only 16. So my coping mechanisms may be dumb but bear with me. But just listening to some music. If you do this alone especially with some good tracks you can absolutely lose yourself in the music but try make sure it's either got good rythm or about something positive. Secondly I like telling people close to me about how I feel. It just feels easier explaining why you don't feel good and making sure that people understand how this is messing you up. And finally surround myself with people I love. Because falling down is hard but with people who care about you helping you get on your feet it's less problematic for me. And I want to just add that I can't believe I managed to do something. I've been trying to cope with the fact my dad's time is shorter than it should be and I have a difficult time trying to forget some of the traumatic events I experienced when I was younger. ( Bullying, and having rough patches. Not to mention being physically assaulted at school). But I've been fighting all of this and with the whole Corona thing I had to cut school short. But I have apparently done well enough to hopefully try and achieve my dream career later on down the line. And I've never really given myself much credit for anything. But that makes me damn proud to hear."
AskReddit,fny2fn0,t3_g3yyee,1587351770.0,Metal gear solid 5. When the parasite spreads around motherbase and your soldiers salute you as you have to execute them showing their undying loyalty and not giving any hard feelings as they know what you have to do. That one got me a little bit.
