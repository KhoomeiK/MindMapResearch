TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fqkkm4t,t3_gj5h6f,1589429419.0,"You probably won‚Äôt stop crying but you can reframe your thinking. I am a cryer, too. I cry just from talking to people. As someone who served as director for our local film festival, I‚Äôve cried in front of audiences and in front of the press. It took me a long time to get over the shame I felt about crying. At this point, people just expect and accept it if they know me. But I also realized that people aren‚Äôt criticizing me for it the way I thought they might be. 

There‚Äôs nothing wrong with you. It‚Äôs okay that you cry. People have built up crying to mean you‚Äôre weak over the years but that‚Äôs an old and false narrative. So many people have called me strong for being okay with crying unashamed in front of a room of 200 people.

For the pocket, you can stick them in the pocket or lay them on top but either way you‚Äôre going to have to put the cover in the laundry after use because the pocket diapers aren‚Äôt wipeable. You don‚Äôt really need a snappi unless you‚Äôre doing a wipeable cover. If that‚Äôs the case, you probably do because it‚Äôll help keep the poop off the cover so you can reuse the cover.
