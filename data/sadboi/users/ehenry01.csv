relationship_advice,etiknjn,t3_cbqd4j,1562852985.0,"Try your best to focus on your own time. Make things better by learning. You can look up online different ways to explore yourself that makes that time better.

That has helped me personally in my situation that is the same. My wife had sexual assault in her past that makes it hard for her, which she is dealing with now as oppose to suppressing it. I am here to support her, so that means I need to explore things by myself.

I have been through counseling on this. I have asked to go outside the marriage to help deal. But it breaks down to either I stay or don't. I decided to stay, since she and my family are my life. It is not worth leaving for something so shallow.

It is okay to be selfish, but make sure you support her! If you truly love her, that is what you can do. And btw I think everyone in this situation have fought, it is part of the relationship. 

Good luck..."
bipolar,etcp8qs,t3_cazwi1,1562689769.0,"For me I overwhelm myself while manic. I am excited for new things and want more and more and more. Start new projects, spit out new ideas, king of the world. Then I get so overwhelmed that I just stop. I hate every email that comes in, panic at the thought of getting out of bed, scared of the world. Then, when I finally feel like I have had enough of the depression I pull myself up. I slowly start picking back up, until mania sets in. 

It is a horrible cycle and you are not the only one. I have now learned to manage it by meds, therapy, help from my wife, and recognition. When I think I am going to start mania, I slow down, breathe, and walk outside. When depressed I get out of bed, shower, go into the world, and shake it off. I would not be able to do this without the years of work. 

I feel like for me this is normal for bipolar because of the cycle I just described. It is part of the disorder and why help is needed to manage. It is the same as hording, recluses, etc. That is my opinion though, not a professional. 

Basically, you are not the only one. Get some help and work and work on it."

bipolar,es7ioco,t3_c61cl6,1561671662.0,"I honestly have mixed feelings. I tend to want to talk about it while manic, then I get anxiety afterwards worrying about over sharing. I also worry that I will get ""oh I think I have that too"", ""yea so?"", or get a gatekeeper that thinks I don't have shit compared to them . I dunno I just feel mental illness is a private thing, but if it is not talked about it will never really get to a point of understanding.

I have never really had a negative reaction from someone, though I have told only a handful of people when I was officially diagnosed with BP1. Everyone's reaction was basically like, yup. There was no surprises. 

I do have one regret. When I was manic a while back after my Dad died, a time I was really all over the place and basically forced me to get help, I told an individual in my life that I was, well, in a possible damaging relationship with. I will spare the details, but telling that individual has left me with regrets. Our relationship now is not the best, and I really worry that they could use the info about my mental illness against me, or that when someone is bitching about me there is the possibility of them saying ""oh he is bipolar"". 

I think it is just best to take your time and think it through....as long as you have loved ones and support, really the rest of the world can wait. 

And no, no social media what-so-ever."
