When I was younger, My Ndad (when he would go through a math work book) used to slap me every time I got a wrong answer. My parents also used to ask my older sister to do my homework for me.

raisedbynarcissists,fq6b7vt,t3_gh384x,1589128162.0,"This totally sucks trying to get them to admit fault. My take on it was that by them doing the things that they did, their own parents might have done those things to them. This is the nparents' way of playing the powerful role reversal. They may even think that by doing so it ""heals them"", because everything is always about themselves."
raisedbynarcissists,fq1u1fy,t1_fq1jb6q,1589049327.0,"I understand, some people along with your brother might be reluctant to get therapy. I know that I used to see it as yet another thing that would let me down.

I hit rock bottom after losing jobs and I know now because of my ADHD symptoms, as well as my coping skills from my upbringing. I was timid, shy and kept to myself, as an introvert, and I used to turn the other cheek. General mistrust of authority figures. Felt like everyone was out to get me. It made me an easy target to just about everyone that wants to manipulate and destroy someone.

Edit: I agree that adults shouldn't be abusing children whether it is physical abuse or verbal abuse etc. Children are truly helpless and it messes them up for life. Therapy can help, from my experience."
raisedbynarcissists,fq1dks0,t3_gggxj3,1589044687.0,"Wow, I really feel for you and your brother. Is there any way that he could get therapy? I know it is expensive and finding the right therapist can be tricky.

I was diagnosed as an adult with ADHD (just a few years ago). My parents were under the assumption that I was being difficult as a child just for the sake of being difficult. It lead to numerous and severe beatings from my Ndad, and everyone in the family took turns abusing me turning me into the scapegoat (calling me selfish, dumb, fat, ugly because I had and still suffer from acne, and I was told numerous times that I would amount to nothing).

I wasn't good at school at all. I just couldn't focus all the time. I wouldn't even hear some of the instructions in class, so I felt lost most of the time in school. Teachers too would bully me and my parents would do nothing about it when I told them. The teachers would even encourage other students to bully me. I have never been one to be violent, even as a child. As a child, I could not for the life of me understand why treating students like how i was treated at home would get me in trouble (it was more along the lines of me saying ""I don't want to be friends anymore"", or anything that made a student cry, would get me into trouble). I was the student every teacher gossiped about, and I stayed at the same school throughout (from kindergarten to grade 8).

My family continued to bully me even after I moved out of the house, as an adult. Only when I became VLC the last couple of years, they treated me better. I haven't told them that I was diagnosed with ADHD. They don't deserve to know. I've gone NC with my sister. My parents are nicer to me, but I really don't want a close relationship. They have f\*cked up beyond belief.

Going back to my first point, I have been in therapy for close to 5 years and it has helped me tremendously. I don't have much money, so the counselling group (within a college which I wasn't attending, mind you) adjusted the price to fit my budget. There is so much of life that I missed out on, but I have tried to put that aside to allow me to heal further and to move on with my life. I still have a lot of issues, but I'm working on them."
MakeupAddictionCanada,fq17s06,t3_gg2gye,1589042931.0,"Are Moody Bee products cruelty free? The merchandise that they sell is very appealing as is the price. That being said, I couldn't find any literature online stating if they are cruelty free."

raisedbynarcissists,fpo0adr,t3_gei9q0,1588776046.0,"That's terrible to make someone feel bad for being sick. As soon as I was a teenager, my Nmom would blame me for getting sick because I was not drinking enough tea. She thought drinking tea would ward off colds. Even if I had the sniffles because of allergies since the house was so dusty and was barely cleaned, or seasonal allergies, she would yell at me for not taking care of myself."
depression,fpmn68l,t3_gea6mo,1588736818.0,"I really want a best friend too. Most of my previous best friends, it was just one sided. I wasn't that great a friend back then though, because I thought that how my parents communicated with me was the way to be around friends. Turns out my parents were verbally abusive. Pointing out people's weight was what I was taught, as well as complaining a lot about everything, and not taking advice. Just complaining for the sake of complaining. Also showing off is not a good way either. 

I learned the hard way, but now that I've learned, I'm not in school anymore and making friends in a work setting is not a good idea. I was told to keep work friends just work friends and never hang out afterwards. I could join clubs but I'm always tired from work, or depressed. It is hard for me to smile and pretend like everything is fine. People want to be around happy people."
raisedbynarcissists,fpm9roh,t3_ge6nld,1588728471.0,"I was told that as a woman, if you get married you have to give in if your husband wants sex. End of story. Always do what your husband wants or he'll cheat on you or leave you.

Another one was that you are supposed to have children with your husband because it is an extension of your husband's likeness.

I was told these things as a teenager. Even back then I was like WTF."
MakeupAddictionCanada,fpm89nm,t1_fpm0g41,1588727590.0,"No, I haven't tried the spot treatment from Origins, and I probably won't because it isn't cruelty free. That being said, I don't want to tell you to go the cruelty free route because its just what I personally believe in. You're welcome to try the Origins one.

Clean & Clear was not working for me but that was a decade ago before switching to straight tea tree oil, Clinique and then the endless acne products from Sephora, and then [well.ca](https://well.ca). Alba Botanica acne gel treatment seems to work very well so far.

What I do is after I wash my face in the evenings, I use the Tarte Knock out tingling treatment. It's a toner that has 2 types of acid that gently exfoliates the skin (it can sting for some people, not for me though). I then use the Alba Botanica acne gel treatment on any areas that are prone to acne as well as the zits themselves. Then I use a drying mask on any spots/zits. Then I use the Tarte  H2O hydrating boost moisturizer all over except for the areas where I used a the drying mask as a spot treatment."
MakeupAddictionCanada,fpltf79,t3_ge7mju,1588719125.0,"I love [Well.ca](https://Well.ca), it is so convenient to have them ship to the nearest location to you, or have it delivered to your doorstep. One find is my holygrail: Alba Botanica acne treatment gel. Yes, you could buy it from [amazon.ca](https://amazon.ca) as well however I don't like buying beauty/skincare products from Amazon. I get the feeling that it could be counterfeit from Amazon.

Anyway, back to my point that it is my HG because I had to find a substitute for Clinique Clearing Gel. I needed to find an alternative because I prefer Cruelty free skincare and makeup. I tried many different products from Sephora, but the only one that was able to take it's place was the Alba Botanica acne gel. I buy Ordinary products from there as well. I miss last year's $10 off coupons when one could be applied to an order over $35."
raisedbynarcissists,fplik3e,t3_gdyu2a,1588713344.0,"I would say a true friend wouldn't invalidate your feelings. That being said in my case, I only have 2 friends left and they both invalidate my feelings about trauma, but I think its because they just don't understand since they have never been in that situation themselves. I instead talk to them about everything else though. I could cut off the friendships, but I do like spending time with them and otherwise have a lot in common with them. I think for you, you need to figure out where they are coming from. If it is a place of respectful ignorance, I would weigh the pros and cons of the relationship. That being said if they aren't respectful at all about your trauma, then it would be wise to cut them loose."

raisedbynarcissists,fpiacvj,t3_gdmabr,1588636849.0,"How awful is it to scare a small child, a defenseless small child that relies on for you everything. My mom used to scare me with ""the Man"" is coming if I didn't eat quickly enough as a toddler, or if I didn't do something she wanted me to do. Years later she told me this and said that small kids are so gullible and started laughing. I was horrified because I had forgotten or buried these memories.

My parents would let me and my sister watch horror movies as toddlers and up, and then laugh when we got scared. My Ndad would even say ""get her, get her"" to the supposed bad guy in these movies. (rhetorical question)How the fuck do they come up with this shit??"
raisedbynarcissists,fphn8b6,t3_gdbtxr,1588624262.0,"My parents were annoyed at me for having zits (what made it worse was that no one else in my immediate family had ever gotten zits). They blamed me for causing it by eating chocolates. They refused to take me to a dermatologist because they were convinced that it was my fault and that I will grow out of it. I didn't grow out of it, and have lots of acne scars and craters. My skin is marred for life."
raisedbynarcissists,fpeqcha,t3_gcqhot,1588552693.0,"Wow, this is truly appalling how he treats you and doesn't care about possible infestations. Growing up, my parents didn't really care about infestations, or cleanliness for that matter. They wouldn't seal up food containers, wouldn't do any basic cleaning even, a sibling would leave old pizza boxes and dirty dishes under her bed. We had a mouse infestation, fly infestation, moth infestation, and centipede infestation, and probably many more that I can't remember. When I was old enough I had to do all the cleaning. At high school and a working part time job, I didn't have time to clean the place and clean up after everyone's individual messes. I was so glad to move out of there as soon as I could. I hope the 2 years go by fast and you can finally move away."
