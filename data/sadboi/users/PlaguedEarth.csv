Metal,fdgxu7f,t3_ela709,1578410982.0,"I have had the newest Fluids album “Exploitative Practices” on repeat since I found out about it. 

On the first track, there is a cartel torture video sample, that is gut wrenching. I had to stop and think about what I was listening to, and if I wanted to continue. Luckily for me, I pressed on, and what followed was crushing brutal death metal. 

This whole albums production is kinda what makes it. It is a huge wall of sound thanks to feedback and heavily distorted, guitar. Speaking of guitar, there is a riff on the song ‘Wrapped’ about 3/4 of the way through the song that gets me headbanging every time. 

The vocals are are what you would expect, a low growl. They are done well, so that is not a knock on the album as a whole, but I would have liked to have seen a little experimentation with the vocals. 

I can’t tell if the Drums are a little low in the mix, or if  it’s because of the feedback and distortion of the other instruments. Either way, the drums are pretty crushing. There are some elements of slam in some songs, with blast beats on the snare.

Did I mention the samples? These are real life samples from the cartels, and there is the well known video of the shooting of Daniel Shaver in his hotel, and a few more. They really add a disgusting edge to the album as a whole. 

All in all, listen to this album if you like a more brutal style of death metal. I’m sure you will like it."
