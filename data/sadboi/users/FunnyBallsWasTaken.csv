unpopularopinion,fddn9zt,t3_eksx3u,1578318502.0,"You're totally correct. They shouldn't be banned, rather they should be regulated. When they're banned outright (or legal age rises) a large opportunity can be found in independent, unregulated sale, and there is waaaay more risk of danger when you're using some bootleg junk you got from someone trying to capitalize on the new massive black market rather than products you buy in an actual store.

Also, if you start banning vapes and their flavors, people who were addicted to cigarettes and using vapes to help stop will just relapse, and many people who potentially picked up a nicotine addiction through vaping (namely all those kids) are gonna turn to alternate methods to get their nicotine, i.e., smoking cigarettes. 

The ban literally does all harm and no good; even considering the amount of people who now won't be picking up a nicotine addiction, that number dwarfs the number of people who will now most likely just start smoking cigarettes, the leading cause of death in the country, rather than using vapes, which still hasn't killed anybody (the lethal vaping illness was debunked as bootleg thc carts).

All in all I think this will eventually subside, it's probably just a panic button. At least that's what I keep telling myself to convince myself that the powers that be aren't actually this braindead."
unpopularopinion,fddmqad,t1_fddg7cm,1578318000.0,"Nah dog, it's bootleg THC carts. Every patient with that mystery vaping illness was found to be smoking wax pens. Even the ones who claimed they weren't were tested and were discovered to be lying. 

Every patient had either traces of Vitamin E coating their lungs or symptoms of inhaling hydrogen cyanide, which is what butanil turns into when it's heated up. Both butane and Vitamin E are common substances used to cut THC carts by independent dealers.

The only harms that vaping has caused that we've confirmed thusfar is addiction and the fact that vaping at crazy high temperatures produce formaldehyde, however the vape generally burns at that point anyways so nobody really does it. The whole thing with butter-flavored juices causing popcorn lung is kind of a can of worms as well, and I haven't done much research into the aspect.
