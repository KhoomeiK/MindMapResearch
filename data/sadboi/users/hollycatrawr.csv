Anxiety,fgn2lsf,t3_ez8uhq,1580936496.0," Iron and b12 deficiency can do this, or at least exacerbate existing anxiety.

If you haven't, check your ferritin (indicator of stored iron), b12, homocysteine (a more accurate biomarker for funcional b12), and methylmalonic acid (another b12 biomarker). Because I was technically within the lab reference range, I was never treated because the computer never flagged it. But reference ranges literally just mean the range of measurements from samples of people that the lab is using for reference. Being within a reference range is by no means an indicator of optimum levels. I was at 17 ferritin, which is within range (""low"" is under 10, according to lab), but optimal ferritin is between 70 and 100 (depending on the source/symptoms you're trying to treat). I got my ferritin up to 50, and it has helped immensely, I have a ways to go to my goal of 100, but I have felt a major difference. It hasn't solved everything, but it has certainly helped me have the energy to move in a better direction.

My b12 was at \~206. According to some labs, it is technically within range. But in the US, our bar for ""clinically significant levels"" is absurdly low (200 or 250, depending on the lab). In Japan and many European countries, they consider anything below 500 low."

It doesn't work *quite* as well as infusion,  in part because bioavailability is higher in infusions, but it is my understanding that it works better than antidepressants. I learned it isn't the ketamine itself that is the antidepressant, its what happens in the brain after ketamine leaves the system. 

I haven't had treatments myself because of a possible health conflict, but I've read incredible things about it. You can learn more over at r/therapeuticketamine

There's also a facebook group of ketamine patients (infusions, spray, oral, intramuscular), practitioners, etc. It is a fantastic resource for learning more. PM me if you want the name.

Another thing to look into...

I had severe anhedonia when I was iron and b12 deficient. I was just totally numb and checked out. I couldn't feel anything. It felt like I was zombiewalking through life--even the good parts.

 If you haven't, check your ferritin (indicator of stored iron), b12, homocysteine (a more accurate biomarker for funcional b12), and methylmalonic acid (another b12 biomarker). Because I was technically within the lab reference range, I was never treated because the computer never flagged it. But reference ranges literally just mean the range of measurements from samples of people that the lab is using for reference. Being within a reference range is by no means an indicator of optimum levels. I was at 17 ferritin, which is within range (""low"" is under 10, according to lab), but optimal ferritin is between 70 and 100 (depending on the source/symptoms you're trying to treat). I got my ferritin up to 50, and it has helped immensely, I have a ways to go to my goal of 100, but I have felt a major difference. It hasn't solved everything, but it has certainly helped me have the energy to move in a better direction. 

My b12 was at ~206. According to some labs, it is technically within range. But in the US, our bar for ""clinically significant levels"" is absurdly low (200 or 250, depending on the lab). In Japan and many European countries, they consider anything below 500 low. 

My b12 was corrected faster than my iron--within weeks. It gave me the initial boost while my ferritin was crawling up."

MrRobot,fbwbed8,t1_fbwa32u,1577145497.0,Fair. I suppose this could be a commentary on how unwelcoming the world is for trans persons; its so unwelcoming that her only hope for happiness was to create a new reality in which her existence would be welcome.
MrRobot,fbw88hm,t1_fbvtctf,1577143169.0,"Exactly. This show was about the different and extreme ways that people cope (or refuse to cope) with their traumas. White Rose wanted to create a different reality by leaving this one. Elliot faced this one and changed it. They both still usedl extreme coping mechanisms.  


The pursuit of the machine/alternate reality was the point.  


White Rose was powerful and had immense resources. She had enough resources to change the universe she lived in,  but she *still* sought out another universe/reality."
MrRobot,fbw7knu,t1_fbw66gl,1577142748.0,"If we weren't ultimately going to see it used, what would it do for you to know what it does? What would it have done for the show? Do you just want to know what it was \*supposed \* to be, or do you wish it actually worked?    


I'm not trying to be a dick. Sam Esmail said that the show wasn't sci-fi. I think it would have detracted from the point of the show if it did work. Since this show was planned so far in advance/was initially supposed to be a movie, I think it was kept intentionally vague."
MrRobot,fbw5y0y,t1_fbvxia0,1577141709.0,"We were part of the show, right? The voyeurs? So I think aspects of the show served as a mirror for us. We were convinced to believe in this machine in the same way that Angela was. We desperately wanted it to be real so that characters could escape their pain and live an alternate reality. 

A person can be both a genius/capable of planning and delusional. 

WR's pursuit of the machine wasn't coming from a rational place; it was a manifestation of her inability to cope with her reality Our life pursuits/dreams come from a place of deep need and attempts to fulfill those needs. 

People ""work their shit out""/cope in weird ways--some on a larger scale than others. Humans go to extremes to deal with their pain. 

I guess my point is that it doesn't really matter whether the machine would have worked or not. The lengths she went to in order to cope are kind of the point; same with Elliot. 

Darlene went along with Elliot because she desperately wanted connection. Look at the lengths that Vera went to. And Tyrell. 

Every character was going to extreme lengths to try and work their shit out.

Edit: White Rose was the most powerful person in the world and had unlimited resources, but that wasn't enough for her. She still wanted to escape. She could have stuck around and changed the world as Elliot did, but she instead pursued a pipedream. She is actually a great foil to Elliot."

I had fatigue and fog for a long time, but it took a while for neuro symptoms to develop. Iron deficiency made me cold and weak.

I'm happy to see that it is at least beginning to reach public consciousness, but people still have a hard time seeing/refuse to see how it is compounded on an everyday level.   

  
I can see how it is so much harder to treat because we can't ask the traumatized to adapt themselves to oppressive conditions. It is also said that people can't heal until they feel safe. Since the traumatic behaviors/conditions are embedded in the structure of our society, and you can't take off your skin, that doesn't leave many options.

depression,f9d8owk,t1_f9b3vn0,1575231254.0,"Hey stranger,

A few things:

I'm sorry you're in that place. I was in that same place a few years ago. Failing classes. Dropped out of college. I couldn't take care of myself. I couldn't conceive of the future. It felt like I was in a hole and nothing would ever change.

It didn't get better overnight. It took a few years. But it got better, slowly and surely.

Recovery is a process.  I had to take it one small change at a time. After three years off, I went back and managed to graduate. I'm still uncertain about my future. There are many days that I fall back into that dark place, but now I know that it's \*possible\* to come out of that hole.

Based on how you describe your relationship with your parents, it sounds like you may have experienced [Childhood Emotional Neglect.](https://drjonicewebb.com/about-emotional-neglect/) It is incredibly common. Once I read about it, my mental health struggles made a lot more sense.

There's no rush to die. Death will always be there as an option. You've made it this far.  Get rid of the drugs to get rid of the temptation to do it on impulse. You found them once. You'll be able to find them again. 

Sidenote: it turns out that I was very iron and b12 deficient, which contributed to my (what I thought was) laziness. It was a vicious cycle of being depressed to eat, and then becoming more depressed due to nutritional deficiencies.  If you have a health clinic, test ferritin, b12, and homocysteine. ""Normal"" range does not mean shit. Ferritin under 70-100 w/ symptoms and b12 under 500 w/ symptoms should be treated as deficiencies, according to literature. A lot of docs don't know this and take normal reference ranges as the word of god, and they're wrong."
