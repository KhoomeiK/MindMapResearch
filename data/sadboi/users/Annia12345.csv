I have a border collie chow cross who also goes crazy when anyone knocks, rings doorbell, walks by, walks down the street or if we move too fast towards the door.

We always ask to not ring the doorbell or knock in instructions. We have one of those video camera doorbells. Usually one of us holds the dog while the other watches out the window and once we see the delivery person we step outside and wait for them to reach the door.

We've had a few times where they didn't read the instructions and ring or knock. It's not a big deal. But we do get frustrated.

One time we put in the instructions ""Don't ring or knock. Have video doorbell. Just leave the food."" My dad pre-paid so it should be simple.

This guy gets to the door and just goes ham on the doorbell. Just rang it continuously. My dad stepped out and explained that we had a video doorbell and that in the instructions we asked to not ring the bell.

He actually had the guts to complain to my dad that we should be answering the door if we are home and that he was making sure we knew he was here. He finished up with ""How was I supposed to know you had a video doorbell?"" Before storming off."

I would also be pissed if my bf was hiding food I didn't like in my food just for his enjoyment.

You are an adult and it's okay to not like things and he as an adult and your bf, should also understand that and not be tricking you just so he can bring it up with friends and family.

Honestly the way he words his statements make it seem like you are a child who refuses to eat anything which isn't very nice. ((Spoken from someone who knows how it feels to be treated like a child as an adult))"

To me, it seems fine. It's not like he's living in his own apartment. He just sleeps in the guest house.

I'm not sure how far it is from the other house but by the sound of it, it's not far.

It will teach him the responsibility of living on his own in the future."
