Get an anti-parasite solution and a 1 gallon hospital tank with a filter(no cartridge because it will filter out the anti-parasite solution) and heater for a 1-3 gallon tank. Then move the fish into the hospital tank once it’s set up. Since the tank is smaller the water will be warmer then it would be in a big tank but that’s good because ich can’t survive in a high temp. I only had my fish in the hospital tank for about a day before the ich was completely gone which was shocking because it was a bad case of it so this should work for your fish :)"

But to cure a swim bladder disease here’s what you need to do:
   -get a 1 gallon hospital tank. I got an Aqueon tank that came with a filter, LED cover, sample water conditioner and sample food, I also bought a small heater made for a 1-3 gallon tank
   -transfer your tetra to the hospital tank and don’t feed him/her for 3 days
   -on day 4 get a frozen pea and thaw it to room temperature (NOT a fresh pea because they have more pesticides) this will help with bloating and/or constipation  
   -remove the skin and cut the pea into 4 pieces then cut 1 piece into bite sized pieces
   -from days 4-7 feed 1 quarter of the pea to your fish every day
   -if the fish didn’t improve then repeat the whole process as many times as need. When the fish has improved you can move it back to the original tank and go back to its regular feeding schedule 

A swim bladder disease isn’t fatal so if you can not cure it, don’t stress because it will eventually go away on its own

Hope this helps :)"
