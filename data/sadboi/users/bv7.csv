Being a fan of all Boston sports there have been plenty of awesome athletes, and I appreciated them for that. But as I‚Äôve grown up I‚Äôve learned to appreciate they are as people just as much."

nba,fhco7ki,t1_fhcnfqf,1581467161.0,"Me too man. I just honestly can‚Äôt see it. Sure we have had other huge name players leave the team that they adored (LeBron, Durant? Don‚Äôt know if he counts leaving the thunder). Something about giannis just feels like he really could be there to win, forever. As a Celtics fan, I hope I‚Äôm wrong. As a fan of sports heroes, I hope I‚Äôm right. He has the attitude and the potential to be bigger than the game and that is something that we only get once every decade, seriously. There are a handful of players that rise above the game and enter the hero zone. I truly think he has this potential. To be honest, before this year I didn‚Äôt like giannis. I don‚Äôt know why, but I didn‚Äôt. But this year he changed my perspective. I can‚Äôt wait to keep seeing this hero change basketball and the world on and off the court and although he will never see this, and probably many other people won‚Äôt see it, just putting this out into the universe will give belief and strength. 

Rant done. With all that being said I hope the bucks never win a championship and that the Celtics get banners 18-infinity and i dont care."

Usually those bonds start with the on court or in practice relationships then grow into something much more. 

This is why I love the NBA. Sure, there is a fuck ton of drama which we all love-but there‚Äôs something more worth his game and this league that you don‚Äôt see in many others, maybe it‚Äôs because the players are so personal with the fans and media, I don‚Äôt know. Little drunk so rambling a bit but I think you people get the picture. 

I love the NBA and seeing things like this make me love it even more."
