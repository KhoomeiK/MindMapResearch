plantclinic,fluktjq,t1_flu3zar,1585504622.0,"What I’m currently trying is a lot of indirect light, and watering once the soil is dried out but not fully. I’ve given it a mist once or twice this week, and i make sure it’s leaves are clean."

Anxiety,f77zvnu,t3_dup9x7,1573481354.0,"hey man, hope you’re well, just thought i’d add my take!

i agree and empathise with you, i am nothing like i was. however. after a good year of fighting and trying to hold on to who i was, i eventually let go, and embraced it, and feel much more comfortable and at ease. i know this sounds like 100% what you don’t want, and i felt the same. 

i read this great interview with Russell Brand, and he said anxiety is a lot like taking psychedelics. if you try to fight it and hold on to your ‘normal’ self, you’ll have an awful time. you need to relax, and let it take you, be open to the new you, and you’ll realise your anxiety settles and you can live alongside it. 

trust me, your anxiety goes down if you figure out what it wants, and where it wants to live.

rather than having agoraphobia, social anxiety, insomnia, panic attacks, and an eating disorder; i now just have social anxiety and one or two panic attacks. 

give it a try, make space for your anxiety and be the person it wants you to be, but obviously don’t shut yourself away and let it rule you.

good luck! i hope you grow to like the new you, it took me a few months but i recommend it. let me know if you have any questions. all those cbt and therapy books that tell you to accept your anxiety, are onto something."

Anxiety,f0n6sym,t3_d5gro2,1568762066.0,"hey man, hope you’re feeling ok atm <3

one thing that helped me was finding something that i enjoy within my comfort zone. so if your anxiety is at it lowest when you’re at home alone. why not get into films? watch some great films! they always make me feel better. or read a book! something funny that, once finished, will give you a sense of accomplishment.

don’t fear, i totally understand you. it’s hard, i know, but i genuinely felt apathetic before i got into books and films properly. now, reading your post, i wouldn’t want to die because of all the films i’d miss or books i wouldn’t be able to read. 

give it time, you always have good days. hold onto those good days. everything is temporary. xx"
Anxiety,ey57ru7,t1_ey47vgb,1566824448.0,"Hey, I’m glad you had a good night! Definitely talking to people you know and love keeps you well.

I totally empathise, having friends and good times at high school is great, and it sucks it ends. But you’ve still got your friends, and you can have good times with them whenever. Those friends aren’t going anywhere, so you haven’t lost anything. :)

I’m very familiar with that fear, and it’s totally an okay fear to have. Spend a little time making your bedroom nice, get some blankets and pictures, maybe a plant or two. You’ll soon feel comfortable there.

I wish you all the luck, and don’t worry if you don’t make friends straight away, it’s a process. x

Feel free to message me at any time if you’re struggling. I have a back catalogue of dog pictures for you to peruse."
Anxiety,ey2askx,t3_cv2z0z,1566732955.0,"Hey, I hope you’re having an ok day.

I moved to university last year and had this exact same issue. No friends, panic attacks, don’t get on with my flat mates. However, after one year I can tell you that it all worked out. I met a few random people and eventually found an entire family of friends that look after me and we have great times.

My tips:

Be yourself, don’t force yourself to hang around and say yes to every opportunity. If everyone’s going out for drinks but you want to go home and watch films, you do that. I met my friends through going to music gigs, which I did on my own because I wanted to.

Drink hot chocolate and eat cookie dough. Honestly changed my life haha

Find an album that comforts you. I like john maus and (sandy) alex g, if that fits your fancy :) you can press play at any point, and you’ll feel a little better.

Get frozen ready meals. you can get 3 for like £7 ($10?). You can microwave them in 20 secs and have meat and vegetables which is super good.

Video call the people you care about often, or just a phone call every week. So you feel less alone. 

Go for a walk every day, and have a coffee at a cafe, get out your flat xx

I hope you feel better soon, promise, you’ll be okay :)"
