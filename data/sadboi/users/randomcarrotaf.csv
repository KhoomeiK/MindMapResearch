antinatalism,fcrinxm,t3_eijx9y,1577902323.0,"Your main issue seems to be birth control, not remaining childfree, so i am afraid this sub is not the best place to get help.

I have a bunch of things to tell you: first, i was sterilized at 22. I went to a urology and was lucky to find a good doctor. If i was you i would go to r/childfree, contact a doctor that might be within your reach (if no you might be able to ask if they know one in your area), write an email explaining your fears and that you found them in this list. Chances are, even if they are further away, they can give you tips. Dont be afraid to contact people, even if it seems weird. Even if they are in a different country they might be able to help you.

Second: visit a bunch of OBGYNs and stick with the one you trust the most. Talk about your fears of birth control and by their reaction you will already know if you can trust them.

Third: trial and error. Theres upsides and downsides to everything. Not using BC can mean painful periods and pregnancy. BC can mean negative side effects, but light periods and very little chance to pregnancy. Once you have an OBGYN you trust, dont be afraid to try different things. Unless its an implant - which no sane OBGYN would recommend getting without trying the pill with the exact same ingredients (if they do: RUN) - you can ALWAYS stop taking them! The pill is 100% in your control. Dont like it? Stop taking it. Its that simple. No need to be overly afraid. I had the nuva ring (quit using it because of weight gain, but it also made me sleep very well so im neutral on it. Dont need it now though.) and i always knew ""if i dont like it it takes me 2 fingers and 1 second to get that shit out of my body"".

Fourth: a relationship doesnt have to mean sex! I had a relationship with a man when i wasnt so sure about being gay. I never wanted to sleep with him, and i didnt (we did sexual things, just not piv). He found it pretty sad because for him, abstinence was never something he considered, but he was fine with it and supported my decision. Our relationship is kind weird, when i was sure about being gay it faded into friendship+ and then friendship - anyways, you can still have a relationship although you are abstinent. Some even prefer it for way different reasons: for me, not having much sex means im sure my partner isnt only with me for sex, but because she loves me. Some have religious reasons, etc. Relationship=|= sex!

If you want experience for certain birth control then i would recommend you go to the subreddit for birth control instead of this one. Theres way more information."

I felt pretty strongly against IVF my entire life because ive always been a huge supporter of adoption, and i wanted to adopt for as long as i can remember (i think i should add here that i am lesbian, i also dont like the idea of just getting knocked up by a random guy)

I always dreamt of adopting a girl, maybe age 8 or 10, from orphanages or refugee camps. The thought of children growing up without a home, without a place of their own, without parents they can rely on in institutions they are shoved into with other children scared the shit out of me when i was a child and i wanted nothing but to help them. I asked my parents about adoption even when i was in kindergarten already and i knew a bunch of things, such as that older children have a harder time finding someone. The Disney film ""the rescuers"" basically was the last thing i needed to know that i want to adopt a girl that age.

When i grew older i realized how badly i behave around children, how i have 0 tolerance for tantrums etc. I was diagnosed with depression and either an attention disorder or dissociation and now i don't trust myself enough how to take care of even myself... also financially it is an issue because so far i had a hard time working regular full time hours - last time i almost ended up in psych ward (almost because they were full and therefore decided that my suicide attempt didn't count as one...), so how i will be able to live financially is nothing i can tell.

tickling,f8u13es,t3_dwi1fv,1574816403.0,"Very very late here but i get it. Its like a victim of abuse telling you that they would never accept spanking as they were abused and hit, and everything you say why its different for you will get twisted around.

I dont think you should have intervened as a moderator though as that post doesnt seem to be the right place to talk about it. Maybe make a separate post where you explain in detail what your issues were with those comments.

The thing is, lots of people were abused by tickling, but just like bdsm engaging in sexual tickling is COMPLETELY different. You are not ""enacting"" or ""getting off"" of their trauma, you simply feel it differently. What feels like hell to them feels good to you, so you engage in it. Bdsm has a long history now of making that clear, and many people nowadays understand this, but for tickling many have never heard about it.

Just as a side note - because if you decide to address it you should also address those people who were traumatized by tickling - the way some people tickle children can actually be extremely sadistic. Its one of the most overlooked form of abuse imo. When i was tickled as a child i did say ""no"" and ""stop"", but with a voice that made it clear that i was joking around. When they stopped tickling me i wasnt mad. But some will tickle their begging children to tears and leave them crying and hurt from the tickling, and often even make fun of them, which obviously makes them feel even more violated. Ive seen it a bunch of times and it made me so sick - this is not what i call tickling, that's just torture and sadism.

So yeah, please address this in the community if you can, but make sure that those who had such experiences understand that the entire thing is not about them and what they endured."

antinatalism,f7i8ftx,t1_f7i7ti6,1573754726.0,"Exactly. After the few months with little to no deep, uninterrupted sleep i had the exact same amount of time where my body didnt let me get up anymore. And i dont mean being tired all day - i was completely paralyzed for hours and blind. My mom even once wanted to call the ambulance because i didnt react after even an hour of constant alarm from my phone. I slept a minimum of 12 hours and lost 1.5 semesters of Uni. Worst thing: my therapists blamed me to not cooperate with my ""sleeping habits"" and drugged me because i was too tired and desperate to refuse the anti depressants...

I doubt that guy really sleeps less than 4h tbh..."

antinatalism,f7hzxnu,t1_f7hyta0,1573750512.0,"Well, the thing is, not being born is not the opposite state to being born. You don't exist, theres no opposite state for you, YOU as a concept simply doesnt exist. Making the choice to be born is nothing worth considering since a choice needs someone to decide - but that someone doesnt exist. If you choose for someone to be born you don't choose for someone specific to exist either - you just give birth and another person appears. We cant just assume a queue of people somewhere in the void.

When someone has to kill themselves however we already caused the damage. We reduce suffering a little, but overall we still accept it. Its better than forcing people to live, but ""nothing"" is still better than a life that drove you to suicide."

Edit: I slept less than 5 hours, interrupted, per night for over half a year because of panic attacks and after that i was diagnosed with severe concentration issues and either dissociation or sleep deprivation induced psychosis (my two therapists said different things so idk). Also, in middle and highschool i slept for 4 hours a night except on weekends because of mental issues as well and i STILL, years after graduating, cant get a normal sleep cycle since the concept ""sleep"" was so damaged for my body during that time.
