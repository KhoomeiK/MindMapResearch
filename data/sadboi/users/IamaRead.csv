The [brass sheet](https://www.mahavirmetal.in/industrial-metal-sheet-and-strip.html) is approx 0.7cm thick

Judging by the thumb is is between 2.5 and 3 centimeter per side.

One dot is maximal 1/4 of 1/4 of a side. This around 2.1 - 2.3mm diameter per hole.

The whole die has a brass volume without holes of 6x (2.5-3)cm x 0.7cm. Which means 37.8 cm\^3.

**Brass** weighs 8.4 gram **per** cubic centimeter or 8 400 kilogram **per** cubic meter

Which means \~320g per die. One hole is around 0.029 cm\^3, so around 0.25g. The difference between the top 6 and the bottom 1 is thus 5 wholes, or around 1.25g which amounts to 0.4% of the die mass.

We can guess that other systematic deviations might play a larger part e.g. not plane angles at fusing it together.

However if we assume it is a perfect die we could simulate the impact of those 0.4%. I will see if I can do that easily on this computer within 10 minutes."

RationalPsychonaut,fp1tzo2,t3_gaekpd,1588247741.0,"I would like to have a physical look on the question.

You say that if there was a replica of atoms of an object, of with you assume it to have consciousness, then people say it would be the physically the same and thus should be the same consciousness.

I would like to offer the following sentence: If there were nothing in the world but atoms and consciousness it might be the sentence is correct. However we would have to ask the questions: 

* is there something else beside atoms?
* is there something else, more fundamental, than atoms?
* do the same starting conditions lead to the same results? (how about with tiny differences?)
* do the interactions and processes between the atoms and electrical fields, and subatomic particles, and spacial and time configurations determine consciousness in regards to the first three questions?

Since there are things besides atoms, a copy of atoms might not be enough. If you have a copy of atoms, but a difference in the electrical fields at the point in time there might changes to the system (even if we assume that atoms are the fundamental block for the dynamic of 'specific' consciousness).

If we assume that atoms are the most fundamental thing and ignore their states of spins and electron quantum variables and subatomic particles and fields and such (so basically saying: that classical mechanics of orders of magnitute of atoms and more without any quantum or relevant relativistic effect determine consciousness) then we would still have to think if small changes would lead to vast differences in consciousness. 

Then the last point (which you already talked about) is there a way consciousness happens? I believe very much that it is completely based in the material world that is based by laws of nature, however we don't know how it works really (at this point in time). So I share your caution in regards to those thought experiments."
