We talked about it a few times but never came with a solution or compromise. It almost feels like it’s takes too much energy to work it out so we just avoid the problem.. I really want to talk to him but I have to build up the courage first."
sex,fpuqs8p,t1_fpmlobx,1588920617.0,"Thank you for the advice and for providing resources! I was honestly stuck on this for a while. I think you’re right and it’s the communication we struggle with because we tend to avoid other uncomfortable subjects. I didn’t realize how bad it got because I always saw us in a good stable relationship, but only because we don’t want to face a problem so we pretend nothing is wrong."

socialanxiety,fnrsvop,t3_g2y3qo,1587200288.0,When you’re walking down a hall or aisle and someone is coming towards you... that’s the worst for me. I never know if I should look at them or wave or drop my gaze. I usually feel bad because I ignore them by looking down or straight ahead.
mentalhealth,fnrsfm8,t1_fnrmuy9,1587199804.0,"I agree. I’m not always happy, but when I genuinely am, I don’t want people to put me down for it. And others who are happy all the time? Good for them. I’d never wish anyone to experience the dread, anxiety, pain, suicidal thoughts I have to go through."
socialanxiety,fnnwdwv,t3_g2mr3x,1587103805.0,"This is going to should really cliche but you’ll know when you meet that person. 

When you have social anxiety, you don’t feel like yourself around most people but there will be that one person you can actually open up to. I know with me, I have breaks, or highs, where I feel more like myself and I open up to people more. I was feeling really good about myself for a few months and that’s when I met my boyfriend and thought that I cured my social anxiety forever. After dating a bit, I spiraled back into my old ways.

I guess what I’m saying is, it’s possible to be in a happy relationship even when you have social anxiety, it’s beautiful, it’s not all perfect, and when it comes to your problems, you gotta fix it yourself. This other person isn’t going to make your anxiety disappear. But if they love you, they will accept you and be supportive."
Cringetopia,fnns5q7,t1_fnll3f8,1587100136.0,"I once wore a BTS shirt and had no idea about it. Everyone was coming up to me asking me about it. My sister was a fan and bought me the shirt and I wore it because it was a nice gift from her. 
I guess this would be an example for wearing a shirt with a band name and knowing nothing about it."

socialanxiety,fn13pig,t3_fyjy4m,1586554175.0,"It may feel so obvious to you, but to others, it may seem that you’re having an off day. I’m sure, in the long run, they won’t remember it. People will always think about themselves and how they present themselves to others. But screw what others think about you. Worry about yourself because you’re the one who has to feel it and deal with it everyday. 
I struggle through the same problem. I constantly feel panic, then shame, then this cringe that people must hate me for doing this to them. Like they’re collecting all the times I said something or did something awkward. They don’t. 
Honestly, if these people aren’t important to you, don’t waste your energy on them. Whatever they feel or think about you is NOT you, and your anxiety is not you. You just need to clear the bad thoughts that tell you that your awkwardness hurts people. It’s easier said than done, I know, but take small steps."
offmychest,fn0z5r4,t3_fyfb2a,1586551600.0,"Definitely wholesome! I was the same; crushing over a guy at work, becoming close while staying professional. I told myself that it’s probably not going to happen so that I wouldn’t end up hurt. He was 5 years older and I thought he’d think I was just some dumb kid to him. He was nice to everyone so it was hard to tell if he had a crush on me. The day he came up to me and admitted he liked me and wanted to go out for coffee was the best day of my life!! I couldn’t stop smiling for the rest of the day! We’re still together 3 years later!
I’m not saying that’s exactly what’ll happen to you, but you never know!"
memes,fmk9yup,t3_fvmema,1586148451.0,I didn’t need to see this in the first 5 unskippable seconds of a YouTube ad at 2 in the morning after watching a bunch of internet spook stories...
mentalhealth,fm65g5h,t3_ft6qwk,1585786681.0,"I am an artist who has been drawing most of my life as well. Although my experience isn’t as traumatic as yours, I feel as though I’ve been losing skill and creativity from depression hitting hard these past two years. I see art or artist draw, want to do that, but become frustrated, uninspired, and do not getting any joy out of it. 

I think the problem is, I’m not taking care of myself. I’m stuck in this place where I’m unhappy and I’m not challenged. I feel like when I was in college, I was the most creative because I had competition and I wanted to do better because everyone around me was doing it to. 

What you can do is maybe take a class or watch a video online where someone teaches you to draw something step by step, and with each step, do something different, for example, add flowers, change the color, etc. do whatever comes to mind, try having fun with it, and don’t worry about it being a masterpiece. 

May is coming up, consider participating in an event called “Mermay” where everyday for the month, you draw a mermaid. Kind of like the challenge “Inktober”. Participating and being in a community with other artist may inspire you and challenge you to draw more.

Hope this helps!"
Reno,fm3k0qe,t3_fsmmvq,1585726248.0,I just want to be clear. Are they saying any mask is good to wear in public? It doesn’t have to be the N95 respirators? I only have the cheapo dollar store ones and a reusable cloth one.

mentalhealth,fljl4fm,t3_fp7slc,1585217272.0,"I saw a post mention something about how you shouldn’t think about the bad things in the future (or even the past) but just focus on now and how you feel in the present moment. It’s normal to worry about things that will happen, but becoming obsessive or overthinking about it will lead to anxiety and stress. If you don’t release that, it gets bottled up and when the bad thing happens, that’s when it’ll all come crashing down.
I think it’s important to have someone you trust to talk to about how you’re feeling so you don’t bare the weight by yourself. Also, when it doesn’t happen, if you do have the breakdown, or feel overwhelmed with emotions, don’t try to control it. 

Having someone who listens to me get out my thoughts really helped me get through tough situations and panic attacks."
mentalhealth,fljjr30,t3_fovy8a,1585215576.0,Weird. I was feeling shitty back at 22 when I thought having depression was for teenagers and thinking “why can’t I be a real adult?” I know better now. Depression doesn’t discriminate. Hope you get through it.

mentalhealth,fhbjmpw,t3_f28d71,1581443624.0,"I’m no professional but it seems like you’re easily influenced by your thought conversations. I’m not sure if it’s a kind of anxiety. You should definitely seek some professional help. For now, instead of having those conversations, you could write down your thoughts in a journal. Also try to make the conversations short. If you think a lot and find yourself with a lot of time to think, maybe start a new hobby to distract yourself. Even try talking to people to replace those conversations in your head. Don’t feel pressured to do this all at once and take small steps."
menwritingwomen,fh4gjso,t1_fh3lonr,1581278418.0,"No. You’re not over dramatic.

Maybe we shouldn’t call it “rape” maybe we should just call it trauma and abuse because everyone can relate to that. And anytime you experience a traumatic event for the first time, it is scarring. It does matter what happened, If you didn’t consent to it, if someone used your body, if they didn’t make sure you’re okay with it, then it is NOT okay. 

And don’t feel bad about speaking out about it. I feel like a lot of us are silent about abusers because of how “little” we think it means to other people. If it was traumatic to you, then it’s a big deal."

So my next question would be, if I’m applying for a specific job, do I need to include pieces in my portfolio that aren’t relevant to it?

I know my professors always said “your portfolio should be tailored to the job you want”. But I feel like when I get feedback, I end up cramming in a lot of things like concept, background, character designs, model sheets, gestures, storyboards, short animations, everything!! It honestly makes my head spin! 

Perhaps the feedback I received for my portfolio was to help me apply to an art school rather than a job?"

We’re human, somewhat dysfunctional, but we still want to form relationships. Sometimes we have highs and lows, and we meet new people when we’re feeling high, but if we don’t take care of ourselves, we might fall back to our old ways because mental illness doesn’t just fix itself. And a partner is NOT responsible for one’s mental health. YES, they should be supportive, but they can’t force them to get help."

socialanxiety,f5oxd0c,t3_dokp36,1572337649.0,It must’ve been terrifying! It’s always good to take a step back when having a panic attack. Do you have a close friend or partner who can join you? You can also practice in the comfort of your home until you’re ready to go for it again. Don’t let anxiety hold you back from doing what you want.
introvert,f5owgmx,t1_f5mqm4p,1572336153.0,Same! I’ve done a phone interview for a job before. I tried to rehearse it but they asked a question I didn’t know how to answer. It was painful
socialanxiety,f4fer8t,t3_dkd8ix,1571569577.0,"I feel you. I used to work at a warehouse where leads and supervisors would scream loudly every time a worker packed an order well. I guess it was a way to get people motivated but it got obnoxious, especially when during a meeting the supervisors forced us to practice and wouldn’t stop until we were loud enough... also got dirty looks from them when I refused. 

That work place valued extroverts (great and all) but seemed to shun people like me who rather mind their own business and be quiet. As if we weren’t participating enough or some shit. It really ups the anxiety when they do that."
