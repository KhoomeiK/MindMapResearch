There is actually a specific personality type that completely nurtures that type of person, one that is extremely logical and insensitive, struggles to understand other people and their emotions. Definitely a thing. I dated one. She was horrible."
penissize,fnvcufw,t3_g3gwai,1587288485.0,"Dude, 6in I’m pretty positive is already above average. For one, I wouldn’t worry about it, and for two, I think it stops at around the end of 15 years, but yeah, different for everyone."
penissize,fnvcmyx,t1_fnum79t,1587288260.0,"This. Specifically the different for everyone. Btw, 6.5 at 14 is def. above average. Don’t let that be discouraging OP."
penissize,fnvckai,t3_g3zd69,1587288179.0,"From my (limited) knowledge, your penis typically stops growing sometime while you’re 15, and the size you posted sounds I think roughly average. I think as far as what’s “big”, only 15% of males have a penis over 7in long, and 3% over 8in, if I’m correct. I wouldn’t worry about it tho, penis size isn’t everything and I wouldn’t let it get to your head whether you’re 9in or 1in. Just do your best at keeping your confidence up and not be a cocky asshole, and you will be fine. Especially if you are worried about long term relationships, as if you really find a good one, she won’t care about your cock, she’ll care about you.


Or some other cringe garbage. Point is, doesn’t super matter. Live your life.

Also happy birthday!"

She finally has made her decision, and no matter how much we all want to love and support her if she wants to come back, the decision was made clear it was final. We are holding her to this.

There is a much longer story to it, but she left my life for a extended period of time, re entering it late November. At this point I believe I had my first experience with love, or at least the closest thing a 15 year old can experience to that. She at a minimum became one of the most important people in my life."

You seem like you had a wonderful part in trying to be a caring and active member of a relationship and he seems to have taken it for granted. I would just try to talk to him about it, ask what happened and say that you miss talking to him more. If it’s met with more dull comments and replies, idk it seems like a lack of interest on his part which is extremely heartbreaking. I hope all for the best, and feel free to message me if you just need someone to talk to at all"

LSD can last for many more hours than most drugs, however, not a month by a long shot. 24 hours I think is a stretch. LSD is a super strong hallucinogenic, from my knowledge. I would suggest going to a professional and seeing what the problem is because no one on here I think is gonna be able to identify the specific problem. Best of luck."

You should never have to make yourself suffer, especially for something like appearance. The best thing you can do is just do what you can to stay healthy I think, and weight doesn’t really matter I feel, as long as you’re just doing what you can :) keep your chin up ok? You can’t hate yourself for the chemical and physical make up you have, you just gotta make the best of it and take life with a stride. Always do your best, and I’m really sorry that your parents are apart of this problem for you. Sometimes it’s hard for people to understand other people’s struggles so instead they handle it poorly, like what your parents are doing. Just, as long as your doing your best, it doesn’t matter what others think, because you know yourself that you are doing the best that you can, and that’s enough"
mentalhealth,fmfwjqd,t3_fuy7jj,1586036336.0,"The thing is, things will get better, but if you want a happier life, you need to push for it. Every day try to push yourself to make decisions you know will make you not just directly happy, but things that create a better lifestyle. Things that increase your feeling of productivity and things to help others some way, wether it is to go do a single little exercise and get it out of the way, or reaching out to an old friend, or current friend, happiness is something that needs to be worked to achieve. As long as you’re putting in the best effort you feel you can, you will find a better life. No matter what, I am confident you can get through this."

relationship_advice,fktnsa1,t1_fktnebj,1584528166.0,"Yeah, after reading the other new comments, so many people responding to these things jump straight to the option of divorce, and I can understand that, but the option of a divorce is extremely huge. I do agree with many of them though, this is a massive violation of privacy and trust, and I feel like extreme measures must be taken.

The thing about marriage is that you pledged to be loyal and strong together for life. On the one hand this is a vow and a bond that should be treated very seriously and is one that can not be thrown away easily, and going with this relationship the absolute last resort should be a divorce in my opinion, not a easy fix. On the other hand he did shatter part of the vow and expectations made at marriage which is a large violation to any marriage.

I feel that if he doesn’t make up for this serious act, that is cause for divorce. Especially if behavior continues like this. He should be making serious efforts to right his wrongs in a multitude of ways. Those ways specifically I think are up to you, but he needs to figure it out, or else he needs to be out."
relationship_advice,fktna6a,t3_fknb46,1584527563.0,"Oh my I’m really sorry, I have little knowledge on relationships, but from my limited knowledge I can come to the hazy conclusion that counseling of some sort may be optimal, and I feel like in every relationship communication is key. You have to draw the line somewhere and start giving ultimatums and he can choose what he wants. If there are guidelines with no consequences, he might not have the wake up call he needs. I’m not sure, but counseling and creating clear consequences for actions I feel is necessary.

On a separate note, I feel that what he did is extremely disrespectful and honestly requires some consequential action. You set down what seems to be very clear expectations and he knowingly defied them without consent. This seems like a unhealthy problem that could definitely turn into much worse if not resolved soon.

Best of luck"
relationship_advice,fjzzr27,t3_ffqesa,1583735366.0,"So I have a thought of that it might be a case in which you just have lost that initial infatuation and hype of a new relationship that typically comes with something new. Some people just limit their view to the positives and struggle to see the negatives at first. I think that maybe you are just starting to see the flaws, things that every individual will have and you will see flaws in everyone if you spend enough time with them. As far as the ex thing, if this whole situation stands true, that could be just you reflecting on a different situation and looking back on it and just seeing the positives. Sometimes when faced with a difficult scenario in anything, a previous experience of the same type of scenario can look much more appealing and you start to question why you left it in the first place. I would maybe consider just trying to think about the wonderful aspects of what you have and being grateful for the individual you have now. Unless there are things that she is doing that harm you mentally and aren’t just some pet peeves you have, to the point where it’s becoming unhealthy or even abusive is the point where you might consider maybe a couples therapy type thing I’m not sure. But if there is a clear problem you can think of, communication and willingness of understanding is super important. Best of luck."
