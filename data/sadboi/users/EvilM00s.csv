On the one hand, everything I have to do isn't that different from a high volume day... On the other, well, you know how it's hard to go from medic mode to civilian mode after a non-stop 24? That's how it feels to me. My depression is treated and for the most part under control right now, but I'm afraid the state of affairs is going to erode my mental health. As it stands most of my days are spent just scraping by, emotionally speaking. 

Just wanted to offer justification to the OP."

depression,fkik5ib,t3_fiojbi,1584221922.0,"I find it frustrating that depression is still thought of as a behavioral disorder. It's not. It's a chemical imbalance that medication can treat. Just as an asthma patient needs bronchodilators we depressed need SSRIs and the like. 

Don't feel obligated to ""snap out"" of your depression; that's like telling a diabetic positive thoughts can eliminate his need for insulin. 

We are sick. Our brains do not work as intended, and that's ok. There is some help, although not as much as I'd like to see in my country, and it's up to us as the depressed population to change this idiotic notion that depression is somehow a choice and does not require treatment."
depression,fj3xini,t3_fb5p17,1582995471.0,"I dig what you're saying. I think, if my own experience is anything, is the basic physiology behind depression- lack of proper brain chemicals. Bad things happen and we become sad, even despondant, but DEPRESSION is a psychological condition characterised by the patent inability to produce specific neurotransmitters in proper amounts. We aren't sad, we're sick. 

It's like an asthmatic having a bronchospasm and wondering why he isn't getting better even though the air is clear, clean and at the correct humidity. It's because  nothing is going to correct the symptoms except medication. So yeah. Go get some meds if you can."

This is why some of us- many, I would think- need medication as well as other adjunct therapies. My psychiatrist feels I fall into this category; without the meds I'm not ok and that's that.

Coming home almost made it worse. My wife is also depressed... So it stands to reason, men being men, that I want to fix her problems for her. Obviously, I can't, and even if I could I honestly don't know if I have the spoons to give. 

Your level of commitment is admirable. Keep on going, and see what you can do to get help. There are programs for your situation. Ha, if only it was that easy, right?"

Everyone wants to tell you ""If you do A, B is your result"" and I am here to tell you it's bullshit. Should be ""If you do A, B is the best you can hope for"". If you have no hope, this equation doesn't work.

depression,fc0dvez,t3_efd66s,1577288111.0,"Today is Christmas. Yay. My depression didn't care. I still woke up feeling angry and hurt. I don't know what hurts, I just know it does. I have a great job, a great wife, money, and I even got laid last night- yet I wake up trying to find reasons to stay alive, let alone awake. Lucky me, it takes a cup of coffee's worth of time to break free of that in my morning.

The takeaway here is that even though my life is pretty good and I'm medicated for depression, there's still a struggle. I'm getting tired too. I recognize your struggle. It's not any external factor, it's my disease. My mental illness makes me feel like this. Unfortunately, nothing is going to get better untill I address the chemical imbalance responsible for my feelings. 

And after that, nothing will have changed, really. There will still be disappointment and struggle. The only difference will be that I'm ready to handle life with a healthy mind. That's all I want. No one can be expected to have a normal healthy life when their emotions are neither. Get with your physician. Change up your meds. I'm going to as soon as the holidays are over and the office is open. Evidently, vyybrid isn't cutting it for either of us."

depression,fblntzz,t3_edpkii,1576965723.0,"As many have said, yes, anger goes with depression, more common in men than in women. I liked the comparison of depression and anger to peanut butter and mayonnaise; it's an unpalatable union. Research would indicate that in many brains, anger produces neurotransmitters that soothe the emotional centers of the brain, as counterintuitive as that sounds. For my experience, anger is empowering to begin with. Add in the lack of concern for consequences that depression brings and POW, you have an elixir that can often get you through the worst. 

It's not the most healthy coping mechanism, but it beats self harm."
