Jeep,fopis8b,t3_g8pzc0,1587962586.0,"I have a 19 jlu and love it. Haven't taken it off road yet. Got about 4000km driven on highway and in city. It rides nice, for a jeep, but is still a jeep ride quality. I was given an 18 jku as a loaner for a few days while I had a detail and inspection done and I found it was a lot worse of a ride, but I agree with the other post. The jku I rode in I found felt more spacious inside. If you are going to be doing A LOT, and I mean primarily, offroading I'd say get a jk. If you want some creature comforts and some more features get a jl. For me a JL is perfect because it's primarily my daily driver and once I get tires it will do some offroading, a weekend warrior sort of deal."
OnePlus7Pro,fng72g8,t3_g1acvw,1586923912.0,"Regardless of what they said when they were marketing their first few phones, their business plan was to always get to this price point and compete as a flagship. They attract you with cheap hardware and great software to get you loyal to the brand so that when they price hike you're more likely to buy it. It's a sound marketing strategy. And even at that price, the op8 pro is still worth every penny in my opinion. 

You compare its price to the s20 ultra it's still a ""budget phone"""

However the 4cyl has better efficiency and more high end torque. And I've heard, but can't confirm, that the 4cyl doesn't have the oil burn issue. 

I don't regret getting the V6. I cared more about what features and options I was getting."

I love my jeep. I'm overpaying for it because I have negative equity from my last vehicle, a Hyundai, but the Jeep itself I got a great deal on. Jeeps are expensive but they are worth it. They hold their value really well. When you get bored with it you can slap some mods on it, which can sometimes add value back into the vehicle. I LOVE my JL so far. I feel like I have a commanding presence on the road. It rides nice and has good power.

There are some negatives. It's not as comfortable to drive. Like the steering is not great. There's like 2 inches of dead air when you steer so it takes more energy physically to keep it going straight on the road. It's loud on the highway with wind noise. But the negatives aren't enough to make me feel negatively about it."

I currently am torn because I've owned a OnePlus device since its release last year and have not customized a single thing on it. I don't have a Mac, so that's not a selling point. My entire family has androids, but all my friends and my SO have iPhones so I'm 50/50 there. I like how stable iOS seems to be. My main reason for not considering switching back to iPhone years ago was the crappy battery life, however it seems since the X and 11 they've rectified that issue. And those cameras."
