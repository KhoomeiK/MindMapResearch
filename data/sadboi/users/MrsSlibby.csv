A doctor telling someone that they are and need to do something about it is necessary and kind as it could extend their life. However, if its said out of spite or to hurt someone then of course its rude. 

In the end, it is not the truth that is rude. The truth is neutral.  It is how it is used that is either kind or rude."

mentalhealth,flq5941,t3_fq2b3q,1585379642.0,"I talked to my therapist about the same thing today. She suggested some mindfulness techniques. Basically she said that, especially when we are alone or have a lot of time on our hands we can get way too wrapped up in our thoughts. So it's good to bring things back into the body. First you recognize how you are feeling. Then you allow space for that feeling hopefully without judging it if possible. Then you analyze the physical sensations you experience along with that feeling. And finally you nurture the parts of you that don't feel so well. 

So for me, I've been feeling really irritable so I just close my eyes and focus on what I am feeling and then I tell myself that that feeling is valid and okay. Then I turn my attention to my body where I notice my jaw and shoulders are tight so I  gently move them to loosen them up.

It's a little thing but it does help especially when you're starting to get really emotional."

We had radios in our trucks in places where there was no cell service and we would often be the first ones on scene. I've never actually witnessed someone dying but there were several instances where people had to be flown out in critical condition and I have no idea if they made it or not. One was an old man who had been camping in the area for years every summer. We would stop by to check on him every day and he would tell us about what books he was reading, for that reason we affectionatly called him book man. He had a heart attack. I dont know if I'll ever see him again.

That was just a small part of my job and it still had an impact on me, I still think about book man regularly. I can't even imagine having that be the entire focus of your work.

Then, my inner voice kind of rages and disagrees even more. It gets to the point where I feel crazy because it's like I'm arguing with myself.

If you practice meditation when you're calm, it will help teach you how to focus on your breathing and your body sensations when you need to to stay calm. Grounding techniques can be anything that focuses your senses in the present moment such as a strong smell or clenching and unclenching your fist or listing everything you can see that's a certain color. If I have someone I trust with me, I  will ask them to repeatedly squeeze my hand. That one works really well for me but only if it's someone I know isn't going to be judgemental about it. 

You can also write down tips for you to try on a note on your phone because when you get panicked it's often hard to think clearly enough to remember what you're supposed to be doing to calm down.

Talking to a doctor is also a good idea.

So you tell yourself you must not deserve it or God must just hate you or something.

So even when things start to go right, you're just always waiting for them to go wrong because that's just what always happens. That's what your brain is used to. It may not be what you want but it's what you know.

And when things don't start going wrong you get more and more anxious about it until you end up sabotaging everything you just worked so hard to build.

I've done this so many times. I just keep hoping that someday, I'll be strong enough to demand happiness from myself. I can feel myself getting stronger, believing in it more bit by bit. I don't know how long it will take but I'm going to keep trying until I get it right."

At first I  was devastated and then I  quickly got into a rebound relationship  because I have a hard time processing my emotions.  When that ended, I  was a wreck again and it took me a while to figure out that it was because I had never let myself grieve that relationship properly. So good job there.

Eventually, I met a guy and although I didn't feel ready to open myself up again, my heart had different plans.

I even tried pushing him away at first by dumping all of my crazy on him at once but he just listened and told me he would always be there for me and he would do his very best to never hurt me like that.

We've been married for five years now. It hasn't been easy, and he has hurt me but he's also made up for it a million times over. Looking back now, I  would never trade what I have for that relationship I lost.

I know it probably doesn't seem like it now and it probably won't for a while but your heart will heal and you will find someone who makes you happier than you could've ever imagined.

I totally understand feeling drained after therapy. I would usually schedule my appointments for the end of the day so that I  could go home and crash after. One thing that helped for me and my husband was that we started to do couples counseling. It helped him to understand what was going on with me better and helped us both be able to talk out issues. If you have a good counselor, they can help you learn new skills and use them with your spouse so you learn to communicate in a healthy way. 

It definitely takes a while and it's a lot of work. I'm not there yet by any means but it has helped. If you can't bring yourself to go back to therapy just yet, maybe try to at least tell your husband how you feel when he questions you about your mental health. Don't be accusatory, just explain that it adds more pressure on you to be positive all the time and that you need it to be okay for you to have bad days sometimes (everyone does mental illness or not). And maybe educate him on the fact that, even with medication and therapy, you will still have bad days sometimes, that's just part of life especially life with mental illness. There are treatments that can help but those treatments can be exhausting and expensive and there isn't really a cure.  Sorry if that sounds depressing but it's the reality for most people with mental illness. But just because there isn't a cure doesn't mean things can't get better. They absolutely can, it's just that you might still have periods where you struggle. And you both should be prepared for that.
