No one knows how depresed I am and I don't act it. So I get Marty could be harboring some demons...
But someone let it be known Marty is telling employees it doesn't matter, I am trippin and it doesnt bother him. His last minute rides via GM stopped when I complained. So the day after he called another employee last minute and made them for 20 minutes late.

It's beyond difficult. It's physically and mentally draining and takes it toll on your health. The ONE upside to all of your problems is that you have options. (You have also reached out which shows you want to get better and are willing to do the work to get better.)

Those chatrooms can take the edge off but I find if I have to do something several times...it isnt the only option I should be using.

You mentioned wanting to drive to the hospital. Hospitals can be a start point and result in more options being presented to you.

You aren't a burden. People care and there are professionals that will help and care. Think of it this way....think of a friend or family member you care about...
If they were to come to you and tell you about being depressed and being suicidal etc. ...what would you do? Brush them off and claim they are a burden? ...I don't think so. You would worry and do what you could to help them. You would listen and help find them help.

Role reversal. Yes. I get you got cheated on and hurt and chances are you would never do the same thing to someone else. But...

If you did. If you were seeing a married man who made you happy and the affair wound up breaking up the marriage. All that drama and life changes etc. You would seek support from your mother to help navigate through the bs.

How would you feel if your mother was the reason the affair was found out and then because she doesn't agree with you - she essentially deletes you from her life and ignores your existence? 

Would you feel hurt?

Once again...you aren't the asshole and I understand the reasons behind your reaction. I just think its good to remain open-minded in scenarios is all. Some space right now is probably a good thing but do you really want to ""delete"" your mother from your life because of all of this?
