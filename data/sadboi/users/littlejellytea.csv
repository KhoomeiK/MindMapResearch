RBNLifeSkills,fr0cnlx,t3_fa3c8e,1589790930.0,"something helpful, starting out, it can be as simple as buy 6 different veggies that sound nice to you, such as broccoli, chard, spinach, carrots, sweet potato, zucchini.

anyway - then for cooking, either bake them or steam them. and that is all there is to it. you can add salt if you feel like doing so, and i would suggest add salt! (before cooking, it matters)

i think a lot of the time, it is super overcomplicated, or very involved recipes. which those are super cool and fun, but just starting out, i think it makes lots of sense to keep things simple so it is not overwhelming. also, i still eat just very plain low effort things. i do not always have time for longer recipes.

also if you are used to eating packaged stuff, the manufacturers add lots of really tasty but addictive ingredients, so it could take a little getting used to changing over.

sweet potatoes are by far my favorite, and they helped me so much to lose my first 30 lbs.

i would eat a sweet potato (Baked) with some boiled or soft boiled eggs, and maybe some greens if i wanted, every single night, for a long time.

basically weight loss is a very profitable business, and so definitely there is a lot of confusing and needlessly complicated advice and misguidance out there. but it can be as simple as baked sweet potato with olive oil and salt."

it is tough to balance, because the reality is that staying away from predators is necessary, while also honoring that it should not have to be this way, women should not be having to do extra work to accommodate predators. it is like a catch 22. and i hate the fact that we as women suffer this way."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fn97o7f,t1_fn974cw,1586762329.0,"unfortunately the doctor i saw was really unhelpful about it aside from spotting some cysts. no, no surgery or anything. i was able to begin reversal of effects of the depo by losing the weight, completely cutting out refined sugar, limiting bread, and only eating fruit + veggie, sometimes nuts or yogurt. i feel better.

i got the shot for 6 months. and take this from someone who dealt with it and coming off of it, try to not worry too much until you can go to the doctor. they should have you do some labs to check your hormones. 

a lot of the doctors brush off symptoms like weight gain or mental as “minor “ but they always brush off specifically female health issues. if you feel something is wrong trust yourself because you know your body."

declutter,fn75b7x,t3_fzwa19,1586713578.0,"you can do it. i did this with a storage unit, and there are only a few things i later regretted not keeping. the decluttering benefits outweigh the regret. 

yes clothing is exhausting to sort through, i find the most effective way is to set a timer for x hours, and then be done or take a break no matter what. the sense of certainty is helpful for my stubborn subconscious that holds me back from starting. 

also consider this, what is the absolute worst outcome possible? really think about it, and write it down in a sentence. for me, it was that i would end up missing an item afterwards and feel sad for not keeping it. it was easier for me to see then that there was nothing that bad that could happen from decluttering, and helped my logical mind move past my emotional fears so i could get to work. 

also! try this - get 3 boxes, and 1 big trash bag.
label the boxes:
-	box #1 = keep
-	box #2 = donate 
-	box #3 (opaque) = ??? uncertain ???
-	trash bag = garbage bag for stained, worn, torn

this technique works for decluttering anything. 

for anything that ends up in the opaque #3 box, close the box, put it away, and forget about it for a week. see if you have to go back in and get anything from it during that time. if not, at the end of the week, donate the stuff. you can go back in for one last look through, but for best results i suggest just donate. 

tip: if you think you may have trouble on committing to getting rid, i do not recommend keeping any items with intent of “selling” them. it is much better in my experience to just go ahead and donate so they are back out there for someone else to get use from. it is so helpful to think about how much joy someone could have finding it in the thrift store. 

good luck."
zine,fn3pz3q,t3_fz1m9k,1586625649.0,"do research on programs that are legit and that help with food shortage. or on how to find resources/programs in your area that can help, as in how to do the research, how to find those programs, where to go, who to talk to, etc. research on laws and regulations concerning food shortage. etc. things that can be acted on. and then make the zine about that. the beginning could have some facts and statistics about food shortage, to introduce the problem. could also include the best ways to support people in need of food. so this would address multiple audiences, the people who are wealthy enough to help, as well as the low income people who need the help. 

you are right to be concerned about solving the problems, that should be the focus. ‘raising awareness’ alone is useless without also providing solutions, though so often a lot of this activism is really just lip service. light hearted poems and drawings indeed do not help anyone who is in need of food.

also focus on your area or city county. make it so someone could take the zine and use it to help people who need food, or to help themselves get food."

Periods,fmaczj1,t3_fs0esb,1585890209.0,"hi i had this problem when i started mine as a teenager, and i worried the same. it turned out, i just was not inserting the tampon at the correct angle, if that makes sense. i also was not using the applicator properly, i was positioning it at the entrance of my vagina and then pressing the button on it, rather than the correct way, which is inserting the applicator first and then pressing the button while removing the applicator. 


also, trying to insert a tampon when not on your period will be difficult for anyone, the lack of lubricant will be uncomfortable. you could use a small dab of oil or lubricant if you are practicing using it. but really i suggest waiting for your period!
