I was on a trip and realized I didnt bring my facial moisturizer and that's what my boyfriend packed so I ended up using it for 2 weeks straight. It does a lovely job. I battled with severe acne in my early 20's and this product is my go to now. I take my makeup off with clear and clear makeup removing foam (another HG), use ponds cold cream (thx grandma), a decent size drop of pure hyaluronic acid, spot treat with clear and clear benzoyl peroxide 5% and seal it all with the aveeno moisturizer. My skin has honestly never looked better. Acne is almost completely gone. I never thought I'd be able to write that sentence. Good luck!"

I have been recieving physiotherapy twice a week since as well. My insurance is paying for 3 months of physio. It appears as if my insurance company does not communicate well within itself because I keep being told different things. My insurance adjuster is adamant that the other party's insurance is responsible to pay out a settlement for me. Tired of chasing this around when it sounds like they don't know what they are doing. I will be contacting a personal injury lawyer.

We got into a stupid argument and I decided it was best for me to leave the venue. Alone, in a small dress and heels I headed outside crying into the snow being as dramatic as possible. I began walking to who knows where shivering and crying when I realized I was lost. I didnt have a phone with me and no money. I was literally outside freezing walking around when a girl approached me with her dog. She took off her coat and gave it to me. I tried to tell her no but she just pushed it at me and continued on her way. I eventually got home but when I sobered up I really regretted not getting her information or anything. It was a nice jacket too. It was super touching because I realized she had to walk home with no jacket. Wish I could say thank you."

We have specific instructions to go the back door and 99% of the time, the drivers March through the front door of the restaurant with their bag and try to walk to the kitchen. Its extremely irritating. Also the orders constantly getting dropped and picked up again makes it very difficult to plan when exactly to expect a driver. Also calling skip is like pulling teeth.
