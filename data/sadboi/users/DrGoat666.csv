My apartment building was two blocks away from where the korean business owners were shot at. Those looters were savages. They were stealing stuff and creating havoc for fun. My mom was pregnant at the time and worried about my grandmother so she brought her some food and some looters stole the bag of food. Thankfully that's all they did. Imagine that. Stealing from a pregnant lady and her child. What sucks is that most of us didn't know how bad the riots would be and that no one would help. I'm thankful to all the koreans who fought back."

So, I told her to please get rid of it and so she returned it to my aunt. My aunt then stored it at my grandma’s house, in her closet. The next day my grandma was complaining and saying that she cannot keep the trunk because all night something was pounding from inside the closet. We asked my aunt about the contents of the trunk and well, to make a long story short, it belonged to her friend who practiced witchcraft or something and got shot in the face."

Paranormal,fnebefr,t1_fncqm8x,1586886352.0,"I just replied one story to the person who commented above you. But here is another story:
It was during my first month working at the studio lot and since I refused to work at the building mentioned in the previous story, they placed me in another building with another officer. 

This building was large and looked kinda like a mayan pyramid made out of glass. At night, all the lights in the large lobby were dimmed but it wasn't creepy and I also had a partner with me. We took turns doing our rounds and made a deal that he will check all the floors where the offices were because he knows the place and I'll just check the perimeter and the three underground parking levels.

I started my first round at around 11:30 pm and by 12 was at parking level 3. I remember this because we had to record everywhere we checked in our daily activity report. There were a few cars parked and everything was quiet. I then saw a very tall and thin man swiftly walking. I greeted him but he ignored me and I noticed the I couldn't make out his features other than he was wearing what looked like a suit and an old school 40s hat. I then saw him disappear into a car. I didn't see him using my peripheral vision, I saw him straight on. 

So, I quickly made my way back to the lobby and I guessed I looked spooked because one of the cleaning crew members asked if I was ok. I told her that I wasn't sure about what I saw and proceeded to tell her about it and it was like she was there. She knew what I was talking about and asked if it was in parking level 3 and if the man was wearing a hat. Apparently, many have seen him including her in that area around midnight"
Paranormal,fne93ox,t1_fmvevms,1586885211.0,"Ok. Here is one:
It was my first week working security at this studio and I was assigned the night shift 10pm-6:45am. They placed me in this one building by myself but it didn't look creepy. It was well lit and the cameras I was monitoring faced every entrance/exit. I did my rounds and waited for the cleaning crew to leave which was at around 2:30 am or so. 

Once they left, I was bored out of my mind so I started listening to music and doodling then I heard people talking by the elevators which are located behind the front desk (where I am) that's dived by a wall. I stopped the music and sure enough they were still talking. I checked the cameras that were facing the elevators and saw no one there. I was really confused because I knew that I was the only one in the building. I got up and went to the elevators and as soon I did that the talking stopped. But after I sat back down the talking started. 

I called my supervisor and told him about it so he and a police officer arrived and checked the building and of course, it was empty. Once they left, I felt embarrassed and convinced myself that maybe I was just not used to the night shift and it was nothing. Sure enough the talking started but this time, it was followed by a low pitch loud humming the sounded like it was coming closer to me. I was really getting creeped out and so I called my supervisor and asked if someone was playing around to get me scared. 

He stopped by and was giggling but told me that he was laughing because no one could stay the entire night at that building. They always start complaining about some creepy stuff going on. He said that it's ok though and to just ignore them. But I thought to myself fuck that and as soon as he left, I went outside the building, closed the front door and just chilled by the steps that faced a dark parking lot. It was almost pitch black where I decided to wait but that was better than whatever was going on inside that well lit lobby."
