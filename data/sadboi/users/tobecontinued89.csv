For long enough that they no longer sound like a lot- more like, this is what I want to change. So it's interesting to put it all in 2 sentences like this, see how it looks from the outside."
Assistance,f90xy91,t1_f90sjg5,1574979006.0,"Great! Now put all that on paper to remind yourself for any time you start to stress over it- you have a plan. If you can put away 300 every 2 weeks- that's 1800$. Plenty for used car from what you said. Do you need to take lessons? How much is the license exam cost? How long would you need to take the exam? What would the first month of gas cost you, would be good to have that ready. Things like that. Make a list, and don't stress about everything at once. You have enough time and you will do great! 
You can then help out with cleaning or dishes, or just see what his mom has hard time getting to and offer to do it. Even if just as appreciation. It's awesome that she agreed to lower the rent! Yes, chip in for groceries, couponing could work, depends where you live. Where I am it doesn't work so I find other ways. Also buy in-store brands are usually cheaper than familiar brands. Another thing you could do even if you can't pay for the groceries is get all the groceries money  for the week and do the full grocery shopping with list for what is needed to save the other family members time. Where I live there are 'healthy food stores' where you can buy pantry stuff like rice, oats, nuts etc in bulk rather than prepackaged and it cost a lot less. Is there anything such there? Suggestion on cooking is finding stuff that will be easier to do with less ingredients to start. One of my 'fancy' favorites when I can afford it is red thai curry chicken- you just need coconut milk, red thai curry paste, chicken meat, basic spices and any veggies you would like in. If you like Indian or Thai or spicy food this is perfect and super simple. Probably tastes better if you make the curry yourself but I love this version too. If you're vegetarian or something I apologize for the suggestion. Anyway. I'm sure this is stressful because you thought things would be certain way and now you have to plan for all these new things. But you are already doing great, planning, communication with his mom, having this new job. Just have some form of organization whether it's google calendar or a notebook, and keep doing what you're doing, you'll do fine!"

As they suggested, since she's not doing it out of spite, just have reasonable talk with her about it. I think there were some great suggestions in there. Also as far as suggesting something to do for her, cooking can be a big thing if she's working and tired. And Youtube has plenty of good recipes, it's how I learned to cook after graduating, just thinking of something I wanted to cook and writing it in Youtube. 6 months later I was a decent cook. I mean you don't have 6 months, but you don't need to be master, just be able to make few good meals. Even ommlettes aren't bad lunch for example. Also, when you write all you wrote like that it sounds huge and scary. Which it very well could be, but write the numbers exactly- for yourself, not necessarily here. Minimum wage minus whatever your expenses are- what do you have left monthly? What will you have by March? Agreed with the suggestion of asking not to pay rent as to save for car if that will actually help. How much would second hand car be there? Also how does it work where you are? Here you can apply for some minimal credit card or some small loans if you have been at a job for at least 3 months- is that an option? Asking your boyfriend for help with any of that- is that an option? What about bus? I assume no one suggested bus because you don't live in an area where that is possible? Just breathe. Write lists. Talk to us. Brainstorm options. I know it seems like a lot to handle, but 3 months is also a long time, you can handle this! If you need extra venting feel free to DM me.

ptsd,f5u5efs,t3_dp5lbd,1572468715.0,"I dissociate a lot more during stressful times. This summer between changing apartment and few other factors it was pretty bad. I have to say, between medication and getting more stable in day-to-day, I've been feeling a bit better and hence getting less dissociative moments. It's more of one-off kind of thing rather than regular thing to deal with. Whenever I get a flareup of symptoms dissociation usually rears it's ugly head too. December is really hard on me usually, so I'm trying to prepare as best as I can in hopes that this time it won't bring my symptoms to a bad state again. Gotta be prepared:). 

As far as what I look like, I think I have different states. When I'm somewhat-dissociative-but still doing things, I think I just look...like I'm spacing in and out, you know? Doing things slower, maybe looking sicklish? Usually I avoid going in public, but sometimes you can't, and I was once in a bank, and there were all kinds of people there, including a lot older, but literally the guard came to ask me if I want to sit down or get water. So I'm guessing I must've look pale/sick. From a friend I know that when it comes to flashbacks I am trembling. I always need hot drinks and blankets and whatnot after. Thankfully those hadn't happened in a while. Literally, I had one really bad one last week, and it was especially bad because I had forgotten how they feel- which is actually good I guess. Means I've been doing a bit better lately. I've also been starting to leave space for things like doing my nails or putting jewelry lately, which sounds unrelated, but when I'm doing bad usually all but basic selfcare is forgotten. So to have the brain-space to think of doing that is good. It's tiny steps, but I'm improving. I remember this summer few weeks when going outside was hard and I was constantly in a very dark space mentally. And doing anything was a challenge. I have a long way to go, but in comparisson I'm doing much, much better now.

All I'm saying is, I know this can feel like hell, when you have a lot of symptoms often and feel like your world is spiraling off it's axis. But it gets better, we learn to cope better. There may still be flare-up periods, but we learn to cope, improve, pass through these and get back on track. You will get through this period and these moments will lessen. And if they come again, you'll know better that it's a period and it passes. Sorry, I didn't mean to write like a whole chapter:P. I just remember times when I was dissociating and having flashbacks and panic attacks multiple times daily, and it was hell. So something struck a nerve from your post."

A little more towards psychological thriller I suppose, but she has a good way of getting in the human psyche and making you feel like anyone is a step away from murder which is pretty horrifying. I swear, she's good!"
Assistance,f50cq4m,t3_dmbnpl,1571925395.0,"This is horrible, I wouldn't want living with someone who doesn't believe you on something so traumatic you went through. I wouldn't feel safe. My advice is keep working for him at least for now as you need income, but try to move out. Is there friend or family you can stay with temporarily in the same city(so you can keep the job)? Also I would go to counselling asap, see if there are free either mental health center or even sexual assault specific center that provides free counselling? I think it's important to keep as healthy as you can in this situation and get counselling fast. And start calculating what you would need to move out and how long it would take you to save it? Write me if you need to talk. I'm really sorry this happened, stay strong!"

ptsd,f36kj08,t1_f36ibty,1570713666.0,I know that feeling. Sometimes you can push stuff ahead in your calendar and sometimes you just have to power through and hope for the best. Can you delegate some tasks to your fiancee or some friends/family to carve a bit more time to yourself?
ptsd,f36fuzc,t1_f36exj9,1570711623.0,To be honest I've wondered if I have that because I always get more tired and sore than others and for other reasons. Like getting huge amounts of fatigue. But I have no way to prove it and a feeling doesn't seem serious enough reason to check it. I did get blood test once for iron and T3-4 levels etc but everything seemed relatively normal. So I think it's like a physical result of my mental health.
ptsd,f36ag7o,t1_f368ibh,1570709357.0,"Thanks! Yeah, arranging events can bring up a lot of anxiety, even if it's about your own wedding. I hope it goes well and you have a wonderful time when the day comes!  It's really annoying that being sore can start this kind of feeling, I go to ballet so there are plenty of being too sore moments. Thankfully it doesn't always happen anymore. It used to happen every time, I guess when I was worse mentally/health-wise. Now it just happens sometimes, but I have no idea what determines it or how to make it better. Sometimes if I can I just run Epsom salt bath and hope that as my muscles get better the feeling will to. But obviously I can't do that every time."

When it comes to these kinds of pills people taper off or deal with withdraw in weeks...So I get how hard it is but 4-5 days isn't that long for this, sadly. Hence why quitting cold turkey isn't recommended. It's sort of unbelievably annoying that you can get the prescription in a first place to take it, but you can't be prescribed more to taper off! What kind of doctor would leave you to deal with this cold turkey? Anyways, sorry, I hope it gets better soon."

LightasaFeather,f2zsxfk,t3_cwpu6p,1570537477.0,"(spoilers)I like the show, it's entertaining when I can't fall asleep...BUT I have one main question that has nothing to do with with the mystery side of it(which in it's own has some holes in the plot). I had this question for season 1 too, but in season 2 it seems more obvious. WHERE are the parents while the teenagers run around solving the game? We occasionally see Mackenna's mom and Alex's sister, but even they appear more to move the plot forward. Same with Violet's grandmother. When they need them for the key card in the hospital, etc... BUT where are Alex's parents when she decides to go with her girlfriend in the woods so she's not alone? Where are her parents most of the time? Where are Sammi's parents when she decides to go to New York? Why are teenagers getting Sammi's truck from inpound lot rather than her family? When do they ever go to school in season 2? Where are Henry's parents when he's finally found and he's in the hospital?

And lastly, what's with Trey(am I mixing his name? can't remember) being like 'I cracked a rib, almost died, but we must solve the game first'. Dude, you must go to the hospital. There is a whole group of your friends that can keep running around solving things, go fix your rib first...I feel like in this season they are completely forgetting to do anything else but run around solving the puzzle, which is starting to feel a bit flat. These shows usually are made more believable by having believable setting, so by them removing all normalcy and leaving only the mystery element, it's starting to be a bit flat. Love the show, but really, if these are real people they need to have life out of just running around to solve the game."
Assistance,f2znyr8,t3_dev5el,1570532148.0,"Probably normal. Going from taking a lot to cold turkey is too big of a change. Do you have any pills left? I'm not advocating you abuse them, but can you take them again and taper over time? Like take less and less over period of days or weeks preferably? Other than that I don't know what else to suggest... Good luck, hope it gets better soon!"

It was a summer gig so I was glad to leave, but anyways. Oh yeah, 2 weeks later I saw he hired 2 other attractive girls. Anyway. My point is, you will be okay, and good for you for leaving!"
Anxiety,f2zn7ne,t1_f2zmb3z,1570531158.0,"Yeeess! Heard the best quote yesterday while trying to get it together. 'Everything worth doing is worth doing poorly.' Basically if you can't 'give 100%' like many motivational quotes try to get to, even doing a little is worth doing and is better than not doing it at all. So doing 10min of emails or work or cleaning or workout or whatever is always better than giving up if you can't do an hour...I don't know why but that quote reaally helps me."

overcoming,f2xdmdi,t3_deobbl,1570476978.0,"Find a way of planning that feels exciting to you. That you like looking at. Whether that means bullet journal, Google calendar, very nice uniform black planner or rainbow colorful one, or todo list app, or mini notebook you keep in your pocket... Research ways to organise yourself and choose one that feels appealing. That way you are more likely to do it. Get a planner, put down any hard information - birthdays, appointments, classes, homework. The more stuff is in plan form the less you need to worry about forgetting something or being overwhelmed. And lastly, figure out if you might be anxious or depressed or lost. Lack of motivation comes from somewhere, so see from where. Is it brain chemistry, like depression, or is it not being excited about the future and needing to make some changes."
Anxiety,f2vmc9m,t3_dehdhq,1570454566.0,"That's still a start!! Maybe next time you'll be able to go in. I know it feels disappointing to go that far and not manage to go in. When you're anxious it feels like you have to fix it all at once and babysteps feel too small... but they still count! And just like you have to take some things slower if you have flu or cold, it's the same with this. Sometimes you have to break down tasks into smaller tasks or milestones when you're anxious. You'll get there."

ptsd,f27ywq2,t1_f2717w8,1570049031.0,"This. It made a lot of things make sense to me when I got the diagnosis(like not thinking that flashbacks mean I'm going crazy or something; also that feeling like my world got split in 2,before the trauma and after, and something has changed in significant way). But also I don't share it with many people, it's not like anxiety. Many people haven't heard of it except in relation to war. So I'm careful who I tell.

GetStudying,f27nj7r,t3_dcc1yv,1570042171.0,"I use Toggl to track freelance work, it's free webpage app, and it had Chrome extension, so you can track manually when you start and end studying subjects and colorcode them. It's simple and free. Otherwise I use bullet journal to plan what needs to get done, I usually need it on paper to make sure it gets done. But in any case you need some sort of monthly or weekly planner to make when you have what, deadlines, work hours and all that. Considering how much you have on your plate, I would suggest monthly calendar for overview of deadlines and all that, but then weekly calendar too where you can add specifically when you plan to study what. Sit down and write all papers and exams you have and estimate how much you need in hours for each project and exam. Always better to estimate more than less. Then according to how much time you have until the exam etc. you can start  scheduling yourself times to work on each projects and break assignments into tasks scheduled into specific times. I had a semester where I had 20h of work along with 6 classes, 3 of which had huge practical projects.... the only thing that saved me was meticulous planning(and I didn't even know quite as much about planning as I do now, just had simple monthly and weekly planner).You can do it! You can check youtube for study and planning videos, at least for me they inspire me a lot."
