Mentally im pretty fucking fucked up and all i think about when im not blocking the thought is how i would kill my self what i would write down who i would tell and what not but i know im not going to do it im to scared to kill my self it human instinct to want to live which fucking sucks because it doesn't let you well ironically live or in my case die all i want is a world to be happy but my happiness is unattainable well one is possible but the other is not what possible is me wanting love whats not possible is what i truly desire which is magic or at least a world with magic anything to do with magic it so fascinating how magic is everything and at the same time nothing magic could make the strongest people weak and the weakest people strong it could bring people from the dead make you fly hell move the earth and crap tons more i just wish i had some speck of power or magic in this fucked up world and society you dont know how much it would help but its not real it fantasy and fantasy cant happen sadly and i doubt i would be able to find love i dont think im pretty or desirable in any way i have weird taste in tv and music all i do is lay around all day i get average grades so i dont think i could become anything that would make someone want to be with me even if i had money the only thing im relatively good at is cooking and art and both thoughs jobs are a living hell cooking is probably the most stressful and painting doesn't get you anywhere unless your dead or like super ass famous im also terrible at opening up and when i do i dont go any further then what i had told them from that time over all i just dont want to be here or exist to begin with

## Origin and Meaning

The name *Quentin* is a boy's name of Latin origin meaning ""fifth"".

Quentin, an offbeat name with lots of character, relates to the Latin for the number five and is by far the subtlest and most usable of the Latin birth-order names, masculine as well as stylish and distinctive. It was borne by a third-century saint and came to England with the Normans."
