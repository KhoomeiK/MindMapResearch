But the notoriously rich owner was hoarding his money, not paying his investors, vendors all over town had told us we couldn’t order from them anymore. I couldn’t buy anything for the bar, I had to use only the liquor that was left from the last order we’d made. The new chef who was just realizing what he’d gotten himself into was buying all our food at Whole Foods. For a 30 table restaurant. Whole Foods. 

The owner was opening new places, more restaurants that would just sit there mostly empty with negative accounts all over town, and staff making nothing. Meanwhile he’s remodeling his mansion. We were told this situation would hurt him more than us and that our last checks would be short. 

I’m hoping it doesn’t come back so I can start somewhere new, and work my way through the new service industry with people like the owner of Prune.

Those two nights a week turned in four or five each week, since the GM was too stressed out by their (admittedly easy for this particular bar) job. I didn’t make nearly as much money at this place as I had at other bartending jobs, even compared to working part time other places, and now I was working overtime and managing a staff. 

I missed being in someone’s wedding, being by my grandpas side for a surgery he could’ve died during, friends and family coming to visit, trips I’d planned...

And when things started ramping up with Coronavirus the GM swiftly disappeared, leaving me alone to run the place. When we got word that bars had to close down our GM reappeared because they’re the only salaried employee and everyone else was being laid off. I’ve never heard someone complain so much about getting paid the same salary and only have to work maybe once a week while millions of people were losing all their income. 

Then the owner told us he didn’t know if we’d have jobs at all once this was over and told us he would most likely be worse off than us (he’s absolutely LOADED.) Anyone who made more than minimum wage got their hourly rate cut down so all of our last checks were for minimum wage, and upon return we’ll all be paid that instead of our previous rate. 

So if this place opens back up, good luck having a bartender and someone to run everything. Several people have offered me jobs at their bars/restaurants when things get back to normal."
