The fact it wasn't allowed at all was mentioned by them, which prompted me to go to building management for confirmation."
AirBnB,fo2xbfl,t1_fo2us6s,1587476269.0,I've already tried with Airbnb and their stance is that we should just go anyway (essentially a wait and see).  That's why I'm trying to explore further options.
AskWomen,fh2wx7t,t3_esod02,1581261991.0,"I had pretty bad vulva pain that would appear both randomly and if I was at all aroused.  It would shoot throughout my entire body, leaving me unable to move for a few minutes, and then sore for 30mins-1hr after.  Carried on for a few years getting progressively worse before I decided it can't be normal and it's probably not something I should just put up with.

I had three separate doctors refuse to do anything about it, as I was not sexually active.  They wouldn't even let me fully explain what was happening or ask questions.  'We'll deal with that when you're having sex' is what one said as he shooed me out the door.  Another told me he wouldn't consider looking into that until I was married!

The idea that a woman's pain only matters if it is inconveniencing a penis is repulsive.  I have finally found someone who doesn't take that attitude, but the fact I had three separate 'professionals' (one GP and two gynos) tell me that basically I exist for men was so frustrating.  I don't even know how they would handle this situation with a lesbian.

Vulva pain matters because your patient is in pain.  That's it."
AskWomen,fh2uoh8,t3_f0h5bs,1581261208.0,"For a more bright/vibrant feel: plants/fresh flowers.  You can get plenty of low-maintenance potted plants that can cope without natural light.  Also cut fresh flowers are an option (if you have a garden/if there are any nature strips near home or work, these can be free). Tiny battery operated water features are an option too.

You can go the cozy route with candles (electric if flames are not allowed), soft furnishings like cushions, rugs, and throw blankets."
AskWomen,fh2tquu,t3_f0qsud,1581260871.0,"I don't see any reason not to be explicit.  If you and that person are at a point where it's too awkward to be clear about your interest, you're not at the dating point, it's still the 'sus them out and figure out my feelings' point.  Sure, asking someone out is generally intimidating or at least you'll be a bit nervous, but it makes no sense to go on a date with someone who you can't tell you are interested in dating them.

I'd been hanging out with my current partner for a bit and knew I wanted to go out with him, so one time together I just asked 'how about next time, we make it a date?'.  Sure, I risked rejection, things being uncomfortable.  But feeling I trusted him enough to not respond badly (regardless of whether he said yes or no) was an indicator I felt ready to date him."
AskReddit,fb8ojhv,t3_ckxv58,1576618351.0,"My mum does massive bulk cooks of things that take a long time (curries, sauces, soups etc) and freezes them in her industrial sized deep freezer.  When I was about 3-4, I switched the freezer off at the power point while playing.  Which just happened to be just before us going on holiday.  We came home to a horrendous smell and a good few months worth of now inedible meals."

AskReddit,f6krqzt,t3_cqpx9c,1572919099.0,"A guy I'd never met walked up to me at uni and said I was cute, and asked for my number.  I was young nervous and didn't know how to handle the situation, so I ended up agreeing to a date.  We went to the movies, and during he tried to put his arm around me which I pushed away.  Since I clearly wasn't going to give him any attention, he  decided to give himself some.  Right there in the middle of the theatre he started furiously going at his crotch.  He must've stopped at some point but I wasn't paying attention.  I blocked him out and sat there paralyzed in awkward fear until the movie finished.   I bolted to the safety of the other side of the train station gates while he was trying to set up a second date, blocked his number and never saw him again."

From what I've read, you've got two adult men living in a small apartment with dogs, cats and guinea pigs.  I guarantee you, it smells.  Maybe not horrific or anything, but it will smell, any you likely won't notice it because you're used to it.  Get a friend who has no pets to come over and give you an honest opinion.  There are always things you can do to reduce it.  
You mention your morals a lot- if you're religious, perhaps try religion specific dating site.  You'll be able to find women with similar values which will likely make a significant difference.  
Bringing home women from clubs seems like a setup for failure- people who go home with strangers from clubs are generally looking for a drunken hookup.  The fact you don't drink means that's not what you're offering.  I'm not saying you need to drink, rather, look for women in contexts where they are not looking for a drunken hookup.  Join a local musical society/dance class/volunteering group/short course on any hobby that interests you.  You'll meet people who are looking to meet new people and not looking for drunken hookups.  You have the common interest to bond over, and you have plenty of time to spend together in a casual setting before you're ready to ask someone to get coffee with you after the activity."
