EDanonymemes,fr1ozdm,t1_fr1otjp,1589823497.0,Yeah this why I said wanting to lose weight IF you’re overweight or obese. I’m in the same boat that losing too much weight will just make a underweight!!
EDanonymemes,fr1fg79,t1_fqz8k8h,1589818795.0,"Dude I completely respect the idea that we should support and value all bodies. But saying that the idea that fat bodies are unhealthy is inaccurate and pointless frankly hi-lights everything that is wrong with the HAES movement. 

Being overweight or obese puts you at higher risk for health issues. Full stop. Nobody is saying that this makes someone less valuable. I- as a person- with a disability- am sick. But that does not make me less valuable. What it DOES mean is that I am at risk for certain health issues that I take time to try to mitigate and prevent. Not only for myself, but also for those around me and those who depend on me.

This isn't about telling people to lose weight. But it IS about being honest and candid about the realities of being fat or obese. Ignoring that excess extra weight puts you in a dangerous place health wise and that there is a 'point' (to have autonomy and knowledge over your own body and health) is not pointless at all."
EDanonymemes,fr1enuk,t3_gliu2v,1589818395.0,"I just want to say- you can totally be a feminist AND want to be skinny. Of course, this is an ED subreddit, so I am in NO way advocating for all of us to not nourish our bodies in the ways we need. But at the same time, it's totally okay to want to get your body to a healthier place. The fact is, that being overweight or obese isn't healthy for you! The HAES movement, in my opinion, is equally as damaging as societal pressure to be stick-thin. YES- every body is valuable. But just as I would never encourage any of you- as my sisters in struggling with EDs- to stay at an unhealthy weight that was too skinny- I wouldn't encourage anyone to stay overweight or obese. That is NOT to say that I wouldn't support, love and cherish everyone regardless of their weight- but I think the idea in the HAES community that there's something wrong with wanting to lose weight for your health and happiness, or that there is something wrong and inherently feminist with wanting to change for the better- is really dangerous. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: You are a queen at any weight. You have value at any weight. You are a feminist at any weight. But there is nothing wrong with wanting to lose weight if you are overweight or obese, as you are helping yourself become healthier. (BUT only if you do it in a healthy way!!! BC I know in this sub we all do be getting kinda crazy lmao living that ED life.)"
