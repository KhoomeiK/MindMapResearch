Fibromyalgia,ewu6rbk,t1_ewtl5vl,1565766883.0,Thank you! I know I'm VERY lucky to get 6 months full pay. Not many employers do that even here. But obviously that's why I'm called in for meetings. I feel lucky to get the time off to try and recover. I've been diagnosed with ME/CFS as well as fibro now. I have improved with being off work so I'm hopeful. Thanks again!
Fibromyalgia,ewr6zyf,t1_ewr52gg,1565696888.0,Fair comment... 'originate' was the wrong word. I wrote that late last night!

Fibromyalgia,ewr6uwe,t1_ewpz3pw,1565696742.0,"Thanks for this, I might give it a go based on your recommendation"
Fibromyalgia,ewqw4f1,t1_ewqcc4p,1565681998.0,I know what you mean there....I struggle with that too.  the thing to remember is that ALL pain originates in the brain so the absence of an obvious stimulus does not make the experience of pain and less real.

Fibromyalgia,ewpjpxl,t1_ewpffzy,1565642654.0,I haven't used it. They have a Facebook page though which is where I found this and a few other motivational resources
Fibromyalgia,ewpjkja,t1_ewpfvt9,1565642562.0,"It's because I've been off since March... I'm still getting paid full pay but that stops at 6 months. Also at that point they can legally sack me so long as they've followed the right process. The process involves inviting me in for meetings to see if there's anything they can do to support me back into work. To be fair, i do think my managers etc are supportive of my condition(s) and the fact that I get full pay have made it a bit better to cope. I am going to have to go back after 6 months though...  just hope I can manage it..."
