Advice,fc6oep1,t1_fc6o990,1577485429.0,literally one time as a joke i said it’s ok to be gay to my cousin i don’t really need u calling me obnoxious for caring about him idk what the aggression is for. my cousin and i are super close and he doesn’t know that the joke had any underlying meaning to it at all. i’ve never said anything else about it so i don’t think making a joke one time is smothering and obnoxious
Advice,fc6o7qi,t1_fc6nzky,1577485291.0,he doesn’t legitimately know that we think he may be gay
Advice,fc6o31c,t1_fc6nzky,1577485200.0,we brought it up as like a joke and he just laughs and tells us to shut up i wouldn’t say we were obnoxious but i mean ok

beauty,f8v7w3s,t3_e2aun3,1574862363.0,"i’ve struggled with dandruff for a few years, not being able to find any products to help. expensive restorative and moisturizing shampoo and conditioner from morrocanoil and a scalp scrub from nexxus helped but only short-term. 

i went to the dermatologist and they prescribed me this medicine to put on my scalp. it has helped TREMENDOUSLY! they also told me to get shea moisture moisturizing hair masks.

hope this helps, dandruff is the worst :("

Advice,f3futit,t1_f3ep3l0,1570903019.0,i’ve been helping her and have put her before myself for almost a year now. it’s gotten to the point where it makes me feel like i’m not allowed to have fun anymore because i’m always caught up in drama that she causes and her mental health issues. it’s just starting to become exhausting and making me feel like my purpose is to take care of her and not be able to enjoy things anymore. i want to be able to look back at my senior year as a fun time and not as me just helping my friend who probably won’t even keep in touch with me in a couple years...

I hit my dab pen mostly at night before bed and stopped going to school high and smoking weed everyday. I smoke bud about once a week now. I am glad I decreased my use tbh"
StonerProTips,eo931gm,t3_bqwnwv,1558380915.0,"I think it’s ok to try it a couple times and smoke every now and then. I’m only 16 and I regret getting so into weed. It’s bad when it starts effecting your grades, worth ethic, and attitude- which is almost inevitable."
