I do recommend checking out Kubo and the Two Strings if you haven't seen it. Fantastic movie on loss with a message I think you will find helpful."
confession,epd1rue,t1_epbkod9,1559161015.0,That's true. I haven't practiced in many years. Probably went to church for another year after I had my Communion. Thanks!
depression,epd08p3,t3_bue9q3,1559160500.0,"I hope you can find peace during this time of grief. I lost my mom when I was fifteen, and my father when I was twenty-one. I am twenty-three now. I have found that only time will make it more tolerable. 

If you manage to read this, I highly recommend watching the film Kubo and the Two Strings. It has helped me a lot. I had found so many different movies where a parent dies, but Kubo, to me, was the most accurate portrayal of it. It should be on Netflix or any cartoon streaming site as it is Stop-motion.

Please take care of yourself during this time. If you need anyone, feel free to reach out. You shouldn't have to feel alone in this situation."

God Bless."

Thank you so much ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š"
AskReddit,eoy88ce,t1_eoy7odr,1558936080.0,Thank you! My mom was a very traditional cook. I've taken her meatloaf recipe and developed it more. She made a mean roasted chicken too. :) Haven't perfected that one yet though.
AskReddit,eoy1osi,t3_bthnvc,1558932146.0,"Not really my childhood. More adolescence. In school, I was a Honors/AP kid who just never found a niche. I found subjects I did well in, but nothing I could devote my life to.
My mother passed away when I was fifteen. I started finding myself wanting to make the meals she used to make for us. Gradually, I fell in love with cooking. It was very therapeutic for me. Long story short, ended up going to culinary school and graduated with Summa Cum Laude distinction. Am now twenty-three and going strong in the industry."
