Last night I tried some tricks I was taught here on reddit.
I've bought some speakers lately. They're tiny but very loud. They came with automatic bass boost too. (Originally I bought them for long highway drives in my car, because it's so old it only has a shitty radio. Obviously I'm not one of those dumb people who use them in their apartments.)

So yesterday when my upstairs neighbours were annoying me again, I hung those speakers right under my ceiling. Then I connected them to my phone via Bluetooth and started a 10h long ""brown noise"" video on YouTube.
It's basically the sound of a fan, with bass, which kinda blankets my neighbors bass. I turned up the volume real loud and put in earplugs. Then the only noise I could hear was the steady humming brown noise. I was able to fall asleep peacefully and I hope I can make this work from now on too"

BingeEatingDisorder,fje85m5,t3_fcp2da,1583266893.0,"Hahaha me too. A nut allergy would eliminate 90% of my fav binge foods: Nutella, peanut m&ms, nougat, basically anything that's a nut covered in chocolate lol

.... But realistically, I think I'd eat that shit anyway and die from it"
BingeEatingDisorder,fje7o4g,t1_fje4ny7,1583266623.0,"Same here. I'll fantasize about what I'm gonna buy for my next binge. These plans are usually one day ahead at most, because I wouldn't be able to resist the urge any longer.

Mostly I get an urge randomly at home, but I never keep trigger foods around, and so I'd have to go to the store for my binge. When I'm too lazy, I'll postpone it until the next day where I can do the shopping right after work.

Sometimes the urge overcomes me though, then I binge on random soups and rice crackers, which are the only foods I keep at home lol."

BingeEatingDisorder,fgvd3zk,t3_f0kjqn,1581145211.0,"omg so I'm not alone. I can eat bags of different chocolate brands one after another. Eventually I'll feel so full it makes me sick, but in between I just feel nice and satisfied.

I can eat like 300g of chocolate in one sitting and don't feel nauseous from all the sweetness at all. Sugar is my heroin."

Needed this after hating myself after 2 days of b/p...

I like my nose, it's just a really nice shape.
And although I'm a normal weight and don't exercise at all, I have a very defined waist which people compliment me for.

In my head those don't make up for all the things I find ugly about myself but hey... It was nice to remind me there's something I like."

bulimia,ff7idwn,t1_ff722w8,1579650259.0,"Thank you, it's comforting to know there are others who feel the same. You are very strong for actually enduring and analyzing your feelings instead of mindlessly killing them with b/p and 3 months is huge. 
It's true we put too much pressure on ourselves...
Wish you all the best too!"
bulimia,ff6z1u0,t3_erql8c,1579637823.0,"Before a binge I feel depression and anxiety, probably from sugar addiction

After the binge I don't really feel anything but full. Painfully stuffed, so I purge. Also because I don't want to get fat.

After purging I feel calm and tired. No energy left to worry about feelings ‚ô•"

BingeEatingDisorder,fdbjkgz,t3_ekh0c6,1578257982.0,"Hey, thanks for posting your story here. To me it reads like a lot of your issues are work related or have developed there. Do you enjoy anything about your current job at all? Shift working is also not for everyone.

Is changing your job not an option? It seems like your life seemed to be pretty normal and in balance before.

Anyway, you're not going to die from obesity at that weight any time soon, and just because you have been binging and purging does not mean it will go on like this forever. We get a new start everyday, I wish you all the best üòä"
BingeEatingDisorder,fcyosur,t1_fcym9wc,1578084063.0,"Interesting thought, I think it applies to me too. If I'm by myself without any plans on my days off (which is unfortunately most of the time), I can't help but feel unwanted, useless and lonely... Like I feel like everybody around me is having so much fun and I'm the only one staying in bed all day and I blame myself for it"
