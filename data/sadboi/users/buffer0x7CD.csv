Barca,ev98118,t1_ev76aal,1564311084.0,"Thanks, I am feeling a bit better now, comparatively to yesterday. I realized that while I have this setback, the root cause of these problems is something that is associated with the way I handle my emotion. I need to stop relying on people to make me feel good or happy, and start trying to fulfill these things by myself. I guess in somewhere along the lines, I started relying on her, to make me feel happy or appreciated, which was not right. honestly, I don't know how will I learn these things, but I am going to try."
Barca,ev74byo,t3_cdcqyt,1564255080.0,"I know it's not related to FCB, but currently going through a really tough situation. So after a long time (almost 4 years), I confessed my feelings to a friend of mine. Now she is not just any friend, but she is the closest I have ever got to a person. I don't know when this started, but I was always a had a bit of sensitive nature, so to avoid becoming attached to people's, I started putting a cage around me, so I never got any real friends or connection. This girl was the first person whom I was able to connect on a emotional level, without putting bars infront of  me. Now I got know that she is dating someone, so I asked her for a time break , so that I can get out of this romantic feelings that I have for. And you the strangest part is that, it's not I am feeling bad because she is dating someone else and she is not interested me. I am feeling terrible because part of me feels like, I might never regain my friendship with her, because I don't know how to separate these two different feeling. I know might not be making sense, but all I wanted to get it out. Honestly part of me is scared really"
