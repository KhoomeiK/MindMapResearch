socialanxiety,fqfryr3,t3_gihwoj,1589330530.0,"I panic before the thing, about the fact that I might panic later on during the thing, and end up ruining everything for everyone, forever and ever, amen."
wholesomememes,fqfqvn0,t3_gig15p,1589329933.0,"Brene brown calls this an FFT. Fucking First Time. And we should acknowledge that that is what's going on, put the situation and our capability of it into perspective and give it a reality check."
socialskills,fqfqghg,t3_gi7iz4,1589329705.0,"For the first time in my life I am in a healthy relationship with a great partner who I respect. I'm a fairly anxious person (but am working through it) sometimes I will try and explain something to him and he just does not get it. It's so frustrating not being understood and kind of makes me feel like I need to justify my issues which sucks because I know I don't. Despite him being supportive of me and my work on my mental health, he has a really hard time getting his head around the use of therapy and talking and getting to the root of issues..basically everything I'm doing to help myself get better. 'Just don't think like that then' really doesn't help. I try and say that if I could do that then I wouldn't have these issues in the first place, but it just doesn't quite get throughðŸ™„"
socialanxiety,fpwol3a,t1_fpvlzqq,1588967125.0,"It will take practice and is really hard at first, but like everything, it will get easier and more natural. Try starting just with your breathing and really notice the effects it has on your body. If you catch your mind wandering, bring it back. Do this again and again and again."
socialanxiety,fpvl0k1,t1_fpsza2m,1588946914.0,Mum???
socialanxiety,fpsyyd9,t1_fpsxgl9,1588881989.0,Sounds like you have some stuff to deal with to be honest. Best of luck
socialanxiety,fpswc4t,t1_fpsw7ir,1588880720.0,"I don't know, but I didn't think your comment was kind or curious and it could have been."
socialanxiety,fpsuxtv,t1_fpso2n6,1588880046.0,"Those things were listed as activities they could do at 22, not necessarily what they most missed out on they also said they'd never get their childhood or teenage years back, so it sounds like there could have been restrictions there too. I'm not sure what about this comment made me feel I wanted to respond. I guess it's just frustrating to see sweeping statements made about someone when there is little information available to do so. I especially feel this is important in cases with childhood psychological abuse."
socialanxiety,fpsnr0a,t1_fpskruu,1588876577.0,"Being protective as a parent is great and important, but keeping your child from partaking in normal social activities for an extended period of time can be detrimental to their mental health.
They could still have good intentions for their child whilst unknowingly damaging them with their unecessary over protectiveness."
socialanxiety,fps5217,t3_gf8gy8,1588867590.0,"I can't speak for what you may or may not have as such but I relate a lot to the feelings you have spoken about in these situations. I struggle a lot with feeling like I'm constantly judged to such ridiculous lengths it's unreal, and I'm trying to untangle those thought patterns. 
With the help of a therapist, I'm looking into my childhood where I was constantly judged and put down and made to feel like I was a problem or a nuisance every day. I lived for years not knowing I'd really taken on these thought patterns and just behaved as I thought everyone would want me to, lived to serve my partners in really unhealthy relationships even though I knew I wasn't 'happy.' I had no sense of self really whatsoever which totally sucks. 
I'm starting to uncover where these thoughts have come from and tracing them back to what I was taught and shown as a child. 
It's been really helpful for me to find the source of the issue so that I can use that logic to challenge these thoughts and feelings when they come. 
It's really hard work at the moment but really questioning these anxious feelings and putting them in the spotlight, sometimes means they go away."
socialanxiety,fprio17,t1_fppo2s3,1588855120.0,Im interested to learn why you think they have been too harsh on their parents?
socialanxiety,fprigdi,t3_gemu0y,1588854968.0,"Fucking yes. Well done, recognising small wins is so important and focusing on the positives, yeah OK you cried.. but only for 5 minutes, fantastic. Maybe next time it could be even less. Putting your situation and capabilites into perspective with your own journey is so helpful because our situations are all different and we need to acknowlege our individual growth even if to others it may seem small. Good job ðŸ˜Š"
Anxiety,fpogote,t1_fpn5u8c,1588784189.0,So crazy because why the hell do they care about one person in a car when they are constantly going past shit loads of other cars? But I totally feel you on this it and it suuucks
Anxiety,fpofvg4,t1_fpmxmvt,1588783801.0,"Jesus christ this is so accurate for what I feel. Its so ridiculously stupid. I know no one can see me or hear me and I know that even if they could, they probably wouldn't care. But it's like I'm physically frozen by the idea that I will humiliated for doing almost anything."
Anxiety,fpoek18,t3_geiyn7,1588783170.0,"Yes I relate to this a lot. I am constantly overly conscious of what the other person around me is thinking about every tiny thing I'm doing. Sometimes things like the way my face is resting, how much attention I seem to be paying to what's on tv, how long it's been since I last spoke. It's like I'm trying to somehow guess exactly how they would want me to be at each given moment and then I'm attempting to adjust my behaviour to that, meanwhile paying absolutely no attention to what is actually going on and potentially getting really anxious if I feel like I'm 'failing' at being what they would want. It's fucking exhausting sometimes, especially at the moment as we can't leave the house. I am finally getting help though ðŸ˜Š"
socialanxiety,foj43fd,t3_g7hviu,1587807579.0,More like 13 years lol. Ironically for a number of reasons I had recently decided to really work on my mental health and self-confidence and forcing myself to go out and socialise somewhat..... oh well
