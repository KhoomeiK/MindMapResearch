muacjdiscussion,f1nxxv9,t3_da2f75,1569629368.0,"for me, what has worked in my favor is investing in a bb cream that has decent coverage + SPF and applying it with my fingers. i pick 3 eyeshadow colors, one for the ‚Äúcrease‚Äù, one for the lid, and one for the inner corner. i use a fluffy brush for the crease and my fingers for the lid and inner corner. if i do liner, i don‚Äôt do a wing every day. i do use a bronzer and apply it with a fluffy brush, but it‚Äôs light enough that it‚Äôs basically foolproof. i don‚Äôt generally use blush. i do eyebrows (with a taupe pencil), mascara, and some lip balm, and i‚Äôm good to go. 

i agree with another commenter who said to invest in a makeup bag that holds all of your daily products. then the only thing you have to dig for is whatever palette you‚Äôre going to use. that‚Äôs what i switch up every day, but i stick with ‚Äúsafe‚Äù colors that i know look good together (& on me!). 

tinted lip balms may be a worthwhile investment for you, as well. i find them to be great for everyday wear."
