&#x200B;

$1000 of BTC will get you $1400 of Lootfarm wallet credit if you directly deposit.

&#x200B;

The cheapest Manifold Paradox Arcana is currently $17.80 on [cs.deals](https://cs.deals). ([https://imgur.com/a/mwUTdTe](https://imgur.com/a/mwUTdTe))

If you spend $1000 of BTC on arcanas, you'll get 56.18 arcanas. Let's round it down to 56 arcs. 

&#x200B;

Depositing 56 Manifold Paradox Arcanas on [loot.farm](https://loot.farm) gives you $1900+ of wallet credit. I highly recommend choosing this route over your original plan.
