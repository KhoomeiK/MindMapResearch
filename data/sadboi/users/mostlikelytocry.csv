I really enjoyed that we have flawed characters who’s past has clearly affected the way they perceive love. Their conversation during their first night together, along with Hong Seol’s rant towards her father really resonated with me.

I also have abandonment and codependent issues from my parents/previous friendships. So I know I’m susceptible to being trapped in an abusive relationship or even be the one who’s toxic to someone.

HOWEVER, take my advice with a grain of salt as I only read a couple of chapters so it could’ve gotten better. As the others said, this one was heavily plagiarised so keep that in mind. 

But I do recommend the pillow book 1 and 2. I’ve reread it twice already. Idk if watching the drama first, affected my enjoyment for Eternal Love novel or if Pillow Book was better.

AskWomen,fhgu9id,t3_f35zgf,1581579407.0,"My family moved countries when I was 7 and my siblings were 3 and 1 y.o. So my situation might be different. Both parents had to be away for most of the day for work so they gave me the responsibility of looking after my siblings and if I ever take my eyes off of them and they get in trouble then I get yelled at for being stupid and irresponsible. I was also in charge of feeding them by the time I was 11.

This occurred until I was 16. Even then, they didn’t want me to go with friends when they’re at work because I had to look after my siblings. That’s when it felt unfair to me because if you couldn’t trust my 13 y.o. sister with our youngest brother, then why would you do that to me when I was 7? I also realised recently that they never bothered to teach my sister or brother how to cook.

I became my mum’s confidant when I was younger so I get surprised whenever my sister is unaware of certain information. I don’t blame her for it though. I’ve realised recently that I feel like I’m also in charge of mediating between family members whilst everyone says I don’t act like myself if I ever express something negative (my parents never saw me cry till I was 17 and even then I felt embarrassed)"
KDRAMA,fhgqhd9,t1_fhgq66i,1581575137.0,Haha it was actually by FineBros when Kpop was still an anomaly to most and I wasn’t into kpop. But Dope by BTS changed me. So not only did the vid make me obsessed with kdramas but kpop as well
KDRAMA,fhgawtf,t3_f2zogb,1581562601.0,"I was watching a “react to KPOP” vid back in 2013 and was reminded of an old tv show I used to watch which was Meteor Garden (Taiwanese). Couldn’t find it online so I settled with Boys Over Flowers, got obsessed and that was the start of my obsession wth Kdramas"
KDRAMA,fhganoj,t1_fhg26ir,1581562437.0,I miss Dramafever :(
KDRAMA,fh3blnl,t1_fh346w9,1581267129.0,Lmao this made me laugh. I’m gonna have to start “this cured my insomnia” whenever I encounter a boring show/movie now
KDRAMA,fh3a9ax,t1_fh2lun5,1581266661.0,Manbok was so cute when he popped his head in and spotted the paparazzi
KDRAMA,fh39fvz,t1_fh331wd,1581266394.0,The first time I saw him was when he was a guest in Running Man and he was sooooooooo funny and playful. That’s why it took me a while to see him as a villain
runningman,fgpmxbf,t1_fgplwzp,1581008027.0,Haha that’s it!!!! Seems my memory is more fuddled than I thought
KDRAMA,fgfs8tw,t3_ey3ppc,1580746456.0,Yaaaaaay!!! Can NOT wait
runningman,ffit0j7,t3_etj8v3,1579981976.0,One of my favourite episodes! Everyone’s reactions to the “warnings” were soooooo funny
runningman,ffiswdm,t1_ffha2df,1579981892.0,"I think that might ep 135 when Jackie Chan was the guest! If it was, it was also funny and cute how they were both getting perms whilst figuring out the clue"
KDRAMA,fe6ld6e,t1_fe5h0sb,1578894767.0,"Ooooh I think you might be right. If Dad gave the orders, then I think it’s important that Seri has RJH’s brother’s watch. Then dad would hopefully recognise it and investigate. All I know is that it’s an important piece for the plot 🤔"
KDRAMA,fcya0ry,t3_ejcrqu,1578076898.0,This sounds like a dream!!!!
runningman,fctq3wm,t1_fctigc9,1577953736.0,Family
runningman,fcti5ae,t1_fcti1yq,1577944074.0,"Thank you!!!! Finally got to experience New Years here after a decade haha

Happy new year!!"
runningman,fcthuky,t3_eisdxn,1577943785.0,I’m on a holiday in Philippines till Jan 27 ;_; so close yet so far. I doubt they’d ever go to my city in Australia
KDRAMA,fbtmhdx,t1_fbqp229,1577084817.0,I love how you can slowly see and FEEL them slowly falling for each other!
KDRAMA,fb9nkox,t1_fb8xtai,1576643582.0,"Oh my god I was not ready for that drama! I loved all of the characters, especially THOSE characters!"
KDRAMA,fb7kgao,t3_ebs2l2,1576592629.0,"I like that there’s a trend of relationships with better communication like Her Private Life. I also love the trope of mutual pining from BOTH sides of the relationship. I agree with the kisses. It’s getting much better and having a female lead that initiates the (consensual) kiss or clearly reciprocates it makes their feelings more believable.

And let’s throwaway senseless noble-idiocy-for-the-sake-of-drama pls. There are plenty of ways to create angst without this or have a similar situation without making it obvious that the writer just pulled it out of their a** to fill in the last two eps."
runningman,fb7gmlv,t3_ebr581,1576589396.0,I got a mediator INFP
