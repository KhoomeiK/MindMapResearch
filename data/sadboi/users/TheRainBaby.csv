relationships,fmk3vod,t3_fv9b2z,1586143912.0,If he's purposefully trying not to interact with you it's because he doesn't want his other friends to notice he is. He wants girls to think he's single so he has a higher chance of cheating with them.

I got Dragon Ball Fusions running at practically full speed with some minor slowdown, however Y runs terribly. Probably due to my settings, but I'm not sure yet what needs to be changed."

Anyway, so long as they've both agreed prior that they want to get married, I think it's fine."
