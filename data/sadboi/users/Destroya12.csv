itsafetish,fl2irbk,t3_flsi5x,1584751992.0,"Feminism since its beginning has been based around the idea that there are no things men can do that women cannot-anatomy related things aside. In other words, besides from physical differences in the body there are no in born differences in behavior or thought patterns between men and women. Trans advocates claim that they are the opposite gender, brain trapped in their gender‚Äôs body. These two ideas cannot coincide because in order for there to be such a thing as a right or wrong brain to begin with, thereby suggesting there are certain in born traits associated with each sex that cannot be waived away as culture or upbringing. 

This post goes one step further. Feminists claim they are not to be seen as sex objects, that they want to be judged by their actions first and foremost, that they are capable of being much more than baby makers. This trans post claims the total opposite, that women fundamentally are beings to be sexually acted upon by men. 

How can these two polar opposite schools I‚Äôd thought coincide when they so blatantly contradict each other?"

TumblrInAction,fkjakc1,t1_fkj5wtq,1584240544.0,"I'm fine with that, but that ignores a bigger problem. If you have any amount of Democracy in your country you're betting the future of your country on the virtue (or lack thereof) of the electorate. If the electorate is selfish and doesn't care about the long term future of the country, your country is doomed. In that case the people will just vote themselves prizes and treasures until the country's resources are used up and there is nothing left. However, people who were forced into war and had to risk (or lose) their life for their country have learned to care deeply about it. They realize the freedoms we love aren't truly free. They want their sacrifice to mean something, to know that the risk they were forced to take wasn't for naught. Thus, they are more likely to consider long term ramifications on how they vote, because a long and prosperous nation justifies the dangers they went through.

If you divorce suffrage rights from the draft that's fine, but then you should replace the draft with some other form of proof of one's personal stake in the country's future. That proof can be any number of things, but it should be something. Paying more to taxes than you take out in the form of welfare would be one example, but again, it's not the only possible alternative."

Honestly I think Sony made the right choice to sit this year out. If they had showed up I bet it would've looked like this. A conference talking about games we've already seen, only to just give us a release date."
PS4,eqlaiao,t3_byphf5,1560140467.0,"I don't think this conference helped or hurt MS. It was pretty bland, not much we didn't already know about or had leaked before it started. My only reservation is to what extent will Scarlet force users into a streaming service? It was very ambiguous how they transitioned from talking about xCloud to Scarlet, as if to imply the two were linked. MS should clarify that-we are getting traditional game discs or digital downloads, right? 

Also, Halo Infinite isn't coming to XB1 now? Or is it cross gen? Seems like if it's not coming to XB1 then whatever momentum XB1 had left in it's last year is now gone.

Come at me eurofags. You're just salty because you don't run the world anymore. ;-)"

Plus let's be honest, the Chad JewMaericans run the world and they're mostly cut. Uncut virgin Afro-asian-latinos got cucked by the Glorious alpha cut Chads."
