BPD,fnwh6pt,t3_g47njk,1587318305.0,This makes so much sense when it comes to BPD. I never thought of it in this way before but I definitely relate to this
OurPresident,fjt9ji7,t3_fepayr,1583605468.0,It is extremely embarrassing that Biden is even running on the Democratic Party ticket
SandersForPresident,fjoqafj,t3_fek985,1583532758.0,"I definitely agree, the aggressive stance is needed to combat Biden‚Äôs campaign and then Trump"
SandersForPresident,fjomaed,t3_feizn5,1583530628.0,"It is disgusting that he would you such a slur. However, situations like this are helping us understand what type of person Biden is. He is just self-sabotaging at this point"
politics,fjogpmw,t3_fee3q7,1583527407.0,Some people are just a waste to society
bipolarart,fjnv3bw,t3_fe3mgj,1583514970.0,This looks really nice! I love it!
DemocraticSocialism,fjnud51,t3_feensj,1583514591.0,This is exactly why I like Bernie because he is a genuine person who stands up for other people and has for many years. He understands the importance of treating people respectfully and fairly in a democratic society
SandersForPresident,fjni0aa,t3_fe7vxn,1583507826.0,"He doesn‚Äôt have a complete healthcare plan that many would think ‚Äúoh wow, this is actually necessary.‚Äù He pretty much is an opportunist when it comes to many of the issues he ‚Äúsupports.‚Äù Whatever the insurance companies tell him and the amount of money they give him will guide his views on healthcare"
BPD,fbc661z,t3_ecezdi,1576716613.0,"I do this all the time. I have had times when I have had hours of my day using this coping mechanism. It really is a waste of my time but it is very common for me to go through. I would then have that moment of ‚Äúwho am I talking to.‚Äù To get out of this state, I have to remember to bring up the ‚Äúwho am I talking to‚Äù point. I am mostly aware of when I do this, so I have to try and cut it off and analyze the reason for why I am using this as a coping mechanism at that moment"
BorderlinePDisorder,fbc5r1i,t1_fbaddzv,1576716327.0,"I usually journal when I have these negative feelings. I also try to talk it out with someone that I have trust in to see their perspective on the emotion that I am feeling. When I do these things, it is like I can detach a little bit from my emotions and see what is really right in front of me. It is difficult to do this though because I tend to see my emotions as a part of my survival. I just have to really be persistent with analyzing my emotions from a different perspective. I recently started to put my emotions into categories of either being delusions, paranoid thoughts, or rational thoughts. When I do this mental organization of my emotions and thoughts, I can understand if I am being rational or just allowing for the BPD to take over the moment. It does take a lot of practice with this but it has helped immensely"
BPD,fb98g59,t3_ebwcik,1576632059.0,"I can relate to this. When I spiral, one of my first reactions is to buy clothing that I probably might never wear but I do it anyways because it temporarily causes positive feelings"
bipolar,fb97ama,t3_ebvvts,1576631202.0,This looks wonderful! I love the design of it all üíï
BorderlinePDisorder,fb977td,t3_ec1b9e,1576631144.0,"I understand what you are going through. It seems that it is not necessarily that you are attracted to him but it is that you like the idea of him being attracted to you in a way. This is just my observation from what you said so I could be wrong. Since he is turning his direction away from falling more into the attraction with you, he is trying to occupy his mind with you said playing video games with other people. This is just a way for him to cope with this kind of negative emotion that he is feeling. However, since he is playing with female players it gets you feeling negatively even though you don‚Äôt feel attracted to him in a romantic sense. It is normal for people with BPD to get jealous over issues that don‚Äôt usually cause much care for us but for some reason we feel like we need to react negatively. I have had similar situations with my friends in which I would be jealous of someone they are talking to even though I have no sexual attraction whatsoever to my friends. It is just the emotional intensity that makes us feel like we have to have everything in order with no unpredictable circumstances"
bipolarart,fb95zgt,t3_ebtpup,1576630226.0,This is really nice. It represents a lot of what the intensity of mania is like
BPD,fb6v23d,t3_ebqig8,1576561472.0,I have this similar feeling as well. I often fear that I will stop loving my FP for some stupid reason or just that my brain suddenly switches in a different direction. What I do to help with this is just think about the positivity that I have with this FP and see the benefits we have obtained from having each other in our lives
BPD,fb6tui1,t3_eblgq4,1576560242.0,"That is so interesting because I am in a similar situation. My BPD usually makes me fall for the wrong types of guys but this time I am actually slowly falling for this guy who is nice and available. I feel like with BPD, there are moments of clarity and like little windows into what it is like to have a neurotypical way of processing information, not just complete Borderline moments. This at least occurs with me, rarely occurs though but does happen"
BPD,fb6sbz8,t3_ebp2xz,1576558776.0,"I can definitely relate to this! I have a need to be honest with people because I want to have an authentic connection with them. That is why I would tend to overshare my mental health conditions and feelings at moments. This occurred more often in the past but still happens with me today. Now, I just have to find a genuine trust with someone to feel comfortable with sharing my feelings. I just hate inauthenticity so I sometimes try to go and bring up personal topics to make a conversation feel real rather than of small talk"
BPD,fb64wgy,t3_ebeg79,1576541460.0,"It is understandable, I go through this exact thing. I just have to remember to have a balance within my life. Even when I have an obsession or need to be with one person that I am close with, I have to remember that there are other people in my life that I care about. Maybe I don‚Äôt care much for them in comparison to this one person but I still care about them. So what I do is I try to make time for them or just talk about how I am feeling and what I am going through so they understand why I would be only with one particular person constantly. Miscommunication is the worst for anyone no matter if they have BPD or not. So that is why I try to communicate with the people in my life as clearly as possible to avoid hurting myself and the people around me"
BPD,fb1fskq,t3_eb09ah,1576436297.0,"I can definitely relate to this. I tend to be pretty hypersexual to be honest but I do go through phases of extremely low sex drive which is connect to the BPD. This increase and decrease depends on the stress of a situation that I am in. If I feel like I want validation or that I am abandoned, it will increase but if I am chaotic and angry it will tend to decrease. It also decreases significantly when I am in the lowest of the depressions. This also has to do with my other diagnosis of bipolar disorder but primarily the rapid shifts are due to BPD"
Art,fb1f57v,t3_eazgol,1576436023.0,This looks beautiful! I love the complexity of it!
Borderline,fb1c9k2,t1_fb19t71,1576434829.0,Exactly! I have a lot of that feeling when I see a situation that I am not so passionate about but I feel conditioned to overreact. I feel like sometimes with my BPD that I have to feel so passionately about a situation even if it is causing me more pain. It is like I don‚Äôt want to manage my emotions effectively because I feel that I am valid and have to feel that way even when it is an overreaction. BPD really is one paradoxical condition to have. I hope all goes well for you!
Borderline,fb1825g,t3_eb1yrm,1576433344.0,"I can relate this is because I am also a gay guy with BPD. I do get like this such as like today when I was waiting for someone to respond to me but I ended up breaking down just because he took longer to respond than usual. I feel as people with BPD we try to correct our negative feelings and emotions by sometimes isolating from others that we perceived hurting us. I do this a lot with people and I can become quite chaotic usually in private when I don‚Äôt get a response or acknowledgement from someone that I care about. I think it has to do with BPD causing a fear of unpredictability, so when someone for example takes longer to text than usual, this an unpredictable circumstance, it causes us to spiral into a negative state of mind. So yeah, I completely understand where you are coming from."
BorderlinePDisorder,faxybio,t3_eav3bi,1576391944.0,"I can definitely relate to this! I do have this where I go into periods of inflated ego to the extent of being a narcissist then one negative thought, just one, can put me into an extremely negative state in which I feel guilty and shameful of my narcissistic behavior or way of thinking. This is also because I have bipolar so the BPD gets aggravated with my random manic and depressive episodes. However, even without bipolar episodes, the BPD effects my mood so rapidly"
BPD,faxrs4m,t3_eappcv,1576388617.0,"It seems like psychiatrists remain in their our reality at times and want to think that all stereotypical ways that are portrayed of borderlines applies to all borderlines. It is common for people with BPD to be portrayed in the media as frantic self-absorbed, self-loathing neurotics while in reality with many, these symptoms aren‚Äôt always presented so publicly or they are quiet symptoms. It is different for everyone but I see that psychiatrists like to see the world of mental illness as just classical definitions while in reality it is a spectrum. In my case, I have been told that I am nice and seem relatively stable but the reality is that I suffer a lot with BPD but I try to remain as nice as possible to avoid rejection from others but I do have my outburst with people that are close to me which tend to be very chaotic"
BPD,faxqdt2,t3_eatknj,1576387935.0,"I have this feeling when I am in a state of feeling like I am far away from feelings or perceptions of rejection or abandonment. When I go through states of euphoria such as talking to someone that I am attracted to and getting to flirt with them, I feel like I am not with my empty void feeling that I have in my chest frequently. I feel like the BPD thing is a thing of the past and that I was just not in a good place at the time but I have changed. I have found my savior from BPD in a way. However, every positive perception that I create is always met with a negative one that produces a much stronger emotional reaction. This is when I come to terms with having the condition and not taking it as a phase that I went through. Doesn‚Äôt me that we have to dwell and make ourselves feel bad when we feel good because we understand that this positive feeling can come to an end and possibly be met with a negative one. We never know and I think that is the thing that scares people with BPD because we want constancy rather than unpredictability. We need to learn to be at peace with unpredictability and understand better so we can live less emotional reactive lives but at is in a process. That is why when things tend to go my way with a lot of consistencies, I would start to think that the BPD was just a past condition that won‚Äôt affect me anymore."
BorderlinePDisorder,faxo35o,t3_eanx2s,1576386854.0,"Yeah, I do have that feeling often. It really does help with negative feelings that come from BPD. Hugging makes it feeling like just for that moment, at least in my case, that the empty void is either gone or has lessened. This usually occurs with me when I get a hug from someone that I feel a close connection with, primarily romantic but can be friendship based as well"
BPD,faxnjvb,t3_eaq19y,1576386613.0,"I can definitely understand this type of feeling. It is due to the mood lability that comes with BPD. I especially notice with myself that at times to build my self-esteem I exhibit narcissistic behavior. It can make me look and feel like I am the center of the universe but in reality it is to help feel the empty void that is commonly experienced with BPD. 

The paranoia would come in with the feeling of the unknown. I always go to the negative with all situations that involve not knowing the whole story so in a way to cope with it I exhibit either narcissistic, avoidant, or antisocial behaviors. It does make me look like a different person that can have different diagnoses but the root really is extreme emotional instability"
BPD,faut7qg,t3_eamo04,1576352377.0,This usually happens to me after the loss of an obsession that I have about a person or situation. At the end of the obsession I would either be angry or just numb in the exact way you are describing it. I would say that it is a form of splitting since with BPD it can manifest in different ways with in different people. This type of emotional reaction does seem like a split since it is occurring opposite to the previous emotion to this person. BPD carries a whole range of emotions and reactions to emotions and situations in our lives. I went from complete hysteria and neuroticism about my obsessive situation to know just a numbness and apathy towards it
