askfuneraldirectors,erj3gqa,t3_c29upg,1560914587.0,I haven't been in the industry for very long but it seems like the times are greatly changing. While shadowing before applying it was not uncommon to see people will a few piercings and the FD that was prominent at the funeral home had two full sleeves that went to his hands. And much of the people who are studying to be fds w me have tattoos. Tattoos are becoming really common. Tattoos are becoming common place to the point that it seems only if you are at a very traditional business or that tattoos are inappropriate for the office they are they a big problem. It will be a knock against you but I don't think it will kill your chances of a job.
honesttransgender,er3e9hf,t1_er3dn3f,1560461388.0,"yeah it's all good, questions are good, I think it took the one nb person I know 5 hrs to explain it to me, it's a little complicated, and I think it is one of those things were you can't fully get it unless you live it, I may still not get it. So take what I say with a grain of salt."
honesttransgender,er3apli,t1_er36oox,1560459260.0,"Sorry I partly misunderstood the question. but that is the part I know the least about, so I may be wrong but this is what I have had other people tell me as to why people use two pronouns. For binary trans folk they sometimes use both bc it makes it easier for other people bc it feels like there is more option and less pressure, for some non binary people they will use both bc they know that people might not call them they so giving a gendered option that doesn't bug them is a way to have people not refer to them by thier biological sex. For people who are demi specifically they use both bc both make them comfortable so they have it opened up to give other people the choice and is a way to express being demi, so that they can be recognized for that specifically rather than just gender queer, bc the assumption is they=agender. And this is the part that I am the most fuzzy on, but it seems part of it is the same how genderfluid people may use all three pronouns and the specific pronouns changes depending on how they are presenting that day (so if they are wearing a dress they are a she, if presenting male he, etc), so they may love being called she one day and not another, but still want to be recognized as feminine though not female and be able to be called the proper pronoun depending on how they have flowed (?). And though it may be less confusing to some people they aren't concerned with that, they want to express themselves so they prioritize that over broad acceptance and understanding. I'm sorry if I'm explaining this poorly I am not a great information source, and sorry for bad grammar. So for some they use both to make it easier for people who aren't queer, while others do it purely as a way to express their specific gender identity while not really caring if it is confusing for others, they want to express who they are. I don't know I might have made it more confusing."
honesttransgender,er329si,t3_c07dcz,1560454461.0,"this is my understanding it may not be perfect. But it is a variation of being gender queer. if you were to look at gender as a colour wheel red=female, blue=male, yellow=agender, so for people who are demi guys they would be green, and demi girls orange, it is just a specific variation of it, the same way how agender is, or how under warm colours you have red, yellow, orange under the umbrella. So it is similar to why we have a difference bw bi, pan, and gay, they are under the same umbrella but the specific experiences are different so they create a specific name for it, and some people use it bc they don't use they but he/they or she/they and it is easier for people to understand immediately if they say demi boy/demi girl. And for why non binary people identify as nonbinary rather than male or female it is because they aren't male or female, it is just a different experience. For some it's a stepping stone as they figure themselves out, while for others it is just who they are so they created a word for it. I don't know if I fully get it either but I don't see any reason as to why it isn't possible, if I'm saying people should trust that a trans women is a women bc she just knows that she is, I feel the same should go for non binary identities too."
honesttransgender,er310s8,t3_c06j7t,1560453739.0,"for me I always worry about this for myself bc I am not entirely sure if I am a man though I am very sure I am trans. I have pretty severe dysphoria and have been out in some way since I was 12, and am on a puberty blocker prior to taking testosterone, and am so fucking happy that I am, it's small changes but so much more bearable. But I worry bc I know that I can't be ok the way I am now but some parts of transitioning make me scared, bc I am not sure if I am gender queer or just male and I don't know if transitioning will give me a whole new type of dysphoria that I can't predict. To the point that I think I might just be on T long enough for top surgery (where I live you can't have any top surgery unless you've been on t for a year). And is more worrying bc I have had a lot of the things that do cause people to transition without being trans. And I should be going on testosterone a few months after turning 18, but it is still worrying for me. But I also get a little worried when people talk about detransitioners because it feels like a lot of the time cis people talk about it they focus less on some people suffer from a different issue and think they might be trans due to similarities in feelings and it is important to protect those people, and more on delegitimizing trans people it feels more  like oh those trans people it can change at anytime how can any of them actually know, transitioning is dangerous bc they are all just confused. That almost makes alarms go off in my head when I hear people talk about detransitioners."
ask_transgender,er1hrrb,t3_bzzfvh,1560432036.0,"it seems like part though maybe small is that by being the ""man"" in the family she has been in positions that she may not have done otherwise, a small thing that I think could help is taking on a more female role in the family, help out w the kids, the housework, etc, it might also show her that you do have a feminine side in a way. (similar to me being ftm my family and partner became a lot more accepting once I tried to learn how to do carpentry, and other ""male things"" that I had wanted to do for a long time). Don't be extreme with it but she might be more willing to accept you as female and having female experiences if you take on a more female role. I worded this badly but I think you know what I'm getting at. I think a lot of cis people think that when trans people transition it is all clothes rather than actually taking on the role of the gender, so by having some of that female experience of having to take time off of work to take care of the kids, and other things might help her understand, plus if someone is mad at you it never hurts to do work that they usually do."
honesttransgender,er1b26b,t3_bzzivy,1560429381.0,"I always thought the main issue wasn't that police were at pride but that they were marching in the parade? At least that was the issue when blm stopped the parade in Toronto (which I'm a lil miffed about, if it was at least focused on the treatment of queer people of colour I'd be fine, but it wasn't it feels like if I went to a slut walk to talk about the environment it seems unfair to hijack someone else's event). In regards to police presence I agree it should be there, I don't think police are necessarily good at stopping things but I think it makes people more careful and feel safer, granted in my city pride while big is pretty chill in my experience, there aren't really that many drugs (as far as I've seen), or even that much sex, it is mostly ads, and under a dozen people gyrating in thongs on floats or doing weed, like one of our main events in the parade is the public transport flashing colours, it isn't a crazy place. I'm from another country so maybe it is different in the usa, it might depend on where the pride is because the main issue at pride in my city is theft and sunburn, where I kind of get how police aren't exactly necessary in that case. In regards of if they should be able to celebrate pride as part of the parade I am really split bc cops have done us dirty in the past and present and I think their participation is a way for them to do some pr management with out changing, but I also think that it is the start to us healing, and that pride should be for all people not just the ones who's life decisions we agree with."
ask_transgender,eqsfwrs,t3_bz8nqh,1560283983.0,"I've been in your boyfriends position, and here is how I felt in that situation. I had to dump him because the way he acted in the situation was near unbearable for me among other issues. The idea that he would one day not be attracted to me wasn't a big concern, part bc I was less serious than he was, part bc that is already a possibility in any relationship. What did make the situation awful was the complete lack of emotional maturity. In this situation the entire relationship has to be reconfigured you have to relearn what type of dynamic makes both of you comfortable, and that is impossible if one or both of the parties involved refuses to communicate. He felt awkward complimenting me on anything, physical attributes or parts of my character, bc he thought it would make me completely change how I act in order to please him. Don't bring up how female parts of him are hot at random times, but if you guys are having a talk about what you guys like just say what you like. We don't like to be reminded that we aren't really men, but we are aware that we aren't biologically and we are aware the female parts of us might be hot to people, it doesn't take a genius to know that guys like tits you know. it doesn't have to be a big secret. And it isn't unfair to like something someone else doesn't, it applies the same to this as how though someone may hate thier freckles another likes them, it's all subjective and doesn't make you bad. And something to understand is that dysphoria the severity and how it manifests is not only different from person to person but also depends on the day, so if there is something that you like that he is mostly ambivalent about or likes but sometimes upsets him it might be possible to still interact with that part without issues it all depends on communication. (ex. for me also being naturally quite feminine I like being small and especially being carried but it sometimes makes me uncomfortable not because I don't like it but bc it feels like I'm doing a female thing, so being carried or treated as cute is something that can go either way and all depends on how it is done rather than the action itself, and how I'm feeling that day)

And I don't think this is something you would do but it is something that my ex did was that once he realized he might not be attracted to me down the line was that he reverted to treating me how he did prior to me coming out he no longer let me be the big spoon or open doors or do anything outside the role of the girl in relationship, he refused to talk about it but part of it was bc he felt that by treating me male it would almost take away his masculinity in away that wouldn't when he thought he was bi, while the relationship would change in some ways don't act like he is less of a guy bc he is with a straight guy. Talk to him openly and honestly and if possible calmly (don't be drunk and if possible try not to cry or yell). And the order of priority is honesty then it's not being a dick."

ArtistLounge,eq1p9q6,t3_bwxhgt,1559715444.0,"No because unless you are following both closely or see them next to each other you would never think of the images being copies of the other. The changes while nothing insanely drastic are substantial, style, specific posing, character propositions, composition, characters, colour pallets, mood, etc, it isn't traced, and when posing does seem really similar the image is different in all other ways. Unlike other cases like the alien: too cute for this planet that got pasted onto a bunch of other things where it was super obvious that they were the same image. And when the posing and style are things that I have seen many people that probably don't even know these artists have made, heck I didn't know these people before and I've made things that are pretty similar bc these are pretty standard poses and compositions. Where you don't have to see these images to make something really similar, it could very easily be coincidence rather than him purposefully copying. It may be unoriginal maybe lazy if he is referencing the images. some are similar ex the giant mountain goddess thing laying down but I think the character design, background, style and mood are different enough that while it's inspired it wouldn't be copying, bc it is it's own thing no one would see one image and the other a few days after and see a connection bw them unless looking for it.

there are somethings where just bc something plenty would think to do and do similar things frequently, it would still being copying if it has that one thing in common. To use an example from drag Sasha velour has really distinct eyebrows that are part of her brand, plenty of people have made eyebrows similar to her before she did, and many do similar eyebrows but if you copy those eyebrows it is very clear as a copy even if everything else is different. And that's not the case here where having something being kind of similar in a few aspects would make it copying bc it isn't something distinct almost as a trade mark to gashi."

I had someone tell me that the fact that I had already tried being gluten free for a little over a month and hated it wasn’t enough of a justification to not go gluten free bc a month wasn’t long enough for my body to heal itself from a lifetime of gluten consumption. And once had a damn naturopath tell me that the cause of Fibro was sugar consumption and food sensitivities, like sure after a car accident my ability to process foods magically disappeared. People love policing what other people eat bc it is a way to feel control over the illness and put it on the person with the illness rather than let them exist in peace. Food can impact illness if someone is eating McMacs every meal they won’t feel as good as eating actual food but there is a limit it isn’t a cure all."
socialism,epvyfys,t3_bvz600,1559558316.0,I don’t know shouldn’t queer cops be able to express both identities at once at pride. It’s not like the police in pride are there just as cops they are there as queer people who aren’t doing us (though probably only queer folk) dirty from their position of power. The cops that aren’t giving shit about dead trans women aren’t the ones at pride.  I’m a little conflicted about it myself but as a trans person who has interacted w police both positively and negatively I’d rather include them bc queer police are also dealing the systems that oppress us and in some ways have it worse due to the culture they work in that leads to police being bigoted towards lgbtq+ people. They should be part of the conversation and should be able to celebrate being queer with us. Pride is for all queer people not just the ones we agree with.

So if you want to dress one way do it, walk in a way, go by what ever pronoun do it without having a label for explanation. I don't know, I originally came out as a trans man so if anyone asks why I am doing something, I just go with something vague or go with that.

Anticonsumption,epeke22,t3_bui8x3,1559183750.0,"I think that we need to completely change the way we consume and stopping consumption is the most important factor in whether change is made. But I know that change is hard for a lot of people so if I am talking to someone who isn't already environmentally conscience though I'll give them the whole consumption speech (don't buy things you don't need, only buy things that don't do something other things you own already do, or to replace something you regularly used, and buy used or w sustainable alternatives when possible, vote w your dollar and political action, etc) but I tend to mostly focus on those small switches because I know they are more likely to do something if I frame it that way.  People don't want to consume less there is fear that a lack of consumption on mass would drastically hurt the economy, that it will mean denying themselves, having habit then add in how we see what we own as a part of our identity due to being marketed to since birth that items mean we have better lives and in some ways are better people than those who don't. And sometimes when you frame it as doing it a different way it seems almost cool and glamorous in it's own way bc it is shareable and obvious, plus there are some items that I do kind of recommend people buy depending on the circumstances (ex guppy friends, water bottles if they don't own one). Maybe I should go on stronger with the anti consumption but it just seems so much easier to convince them to use a glass straw than to be ok touching the ice in their drinks or  to clean w vinegar, I just hope that it is a way to create a minor shift and get people to make small changes over time.

And I don't think other schools do it in same way but I do think that the way lgtbq+ issues are taught to boys is different than how it is taught to girls bc in some ways it is more acceptable for biological girls to be queer in some way when compared to guys where there is almost a fear of biological boys being queer and that changes how men talk about queer issues versus how women do when teaching and in day to day conversation.

Where I live our equivalent is remembrance day in November, I think it is less major of an holiday here where we do not have parades or a day off for it. It is more about remembering not necessarily celebrating war though it may depend where in Canada you are. The celebration that does occur is less framed as how we should celebrate all soldiers and our military success, and more how young people in ww1 and ww2 with no clue what war would be like, went to war, suffering through horrific things during and after the war and that we should celebrate them for just getting through it. Though there is some celebration of our military success like we are still very proud of the battle of Versailles and liberating Holland, but it is secondary to reflecting on war. Ultimately I think the issue is more in how we frame these types of holidays rather than the holiday itself."

And people frequently flat out forget that we exist.  I think quite a bit of why they are so loud and in a way protective is bc for trans women they don't adopt queerness as early on so this is their start of trying to sort out identity. The same way that queer people in high school tend to be really attached to the queer identity in a way older queer people don't. And there is kind of male socialization to be more outspoken, plus feeling like they have to be on the defense bc there is so much stigma to being a trans women plus the general divide that different groups of trans people have always had against each other. As well reddit is a a site that is more male so it makes sense that most trans women when they start transitioning go here (the same way that most trans women when they realized they are trans used to go on to 4chan and a lot of trans masc folks when early on go to tumblr) it's why there are more ppl on mtf than ftm.  I am not saying that they aren't actually women but for most trans people there is kind of a switch between mind sets as we transition and our relationship to being trans changes, it has little to do with the trans community as a whole but this very specific community bc they are early on in their journey, so while it sucks to the point that I feel like i should get off of it and similar subs, don't let it get to you too much."

bisexualadults,eo7b6xw,t3_bqjyfx,1558335624.0,"well because being very clearly queer has shaped my life. So when I am talking about some things the fact that I am bi is kind of a major factor in what I am talking about and I can't really talk about it without saying I am bi in some way ex. talking about my child hood, experiences with discrimination, my dating experiences (both casually mentioning people I have dated or actually talking about my relationships and what led to break ups) or my plans for having a family and parenting during that, and many other things that are pretty normal conversation topics and have nothing to do with sex. I'm not someone who defines myself by my sexuality and I don't have a full need to shout it out, but it is something that I have struggled with at times and has shaped how I see things and what I have experienced. And it is still not great to be gay so being out helps me find other people who are, and while I don't think anyone has to do this but by being out I can be representation, I can explain things to people, either them asking questions or when I need to explain things when someone says/does something blatantly homophobic. 

Also I'm from Canada you don't have to go to conservative place to start getting issues if you aren't straight passing. I don't think everyone needs to come out or that you have shame if you don't come out but if you are in a place where you have never had an experience that is intrinsically bisexual, have it shape your experiences at all, or just don't talk about anything remotely personal to anyone you are the minority, I'm glad you are in that position but you are a absolutely a rarity my friend."
asktransgender,eo769rc,t3_bqkpsi,1558332638.0,"Trans phobia in queer spaces is way more common than it should be. I understand why it is so common bc as many have already said the experiences of trans and gay people are so different to the point that we probably shouldn't be lumped into the same group, it is hard to understand if you haven't been through it, extreme ignorance, many specifically lesbians feel that trans people further ideas about gender through existing that they have struggled with and it sure does feel good to pretend you are better than others that are similar to you. But this is like all other infighting in the lgbtq+ community passing vs non passing trans people, binary vs nb trans people, lesbians vs gays, homosexual vs aromatic, bisexual and asexual people, etc. It just hurts all of us in situations like this as well as getting societal change. I wish there was something that made it easier for people within the lgbtq community to get educated on the experiences of others within it without having to go through a shit ton of misinformation bc this shit sucks, when the people that are supposed to be on your side are treating you like a freak of nature."
