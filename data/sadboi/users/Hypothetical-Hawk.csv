RelationshipAdviceNow,fqyz0qe,t3_gln7uu,1589756997.0,"Part of the reason high school relationships don't last is because once you get out there, and interact with more people, you *can and will* find someone who has more in common with you, takes care of himself, and respects when you tell him things. That might be your guy in the future, but that's not who your guy is right now. Now. My parents got married before they even graduated high school, and they're still together, but let me give you a slice of harsh reality. The only reason they're still together is because my mother shut up and dealt with my Dad's bullshit (mostly being an irresponsible man-child, but also being disrespectful of my mom's wishes, and generally disregarding her in a lot of cases), to her detriment. She did this my whole life, for us kids. She wanted to give us kids the best upbringing she could. So she dealt with it. And I saw her unhappy many times. And she was on a variety of panic/depression medications. Now, after all these years and my *Dad* getting some harsh slaps of reality to the face he's finally seeking therapy, and they are both finally happy. Like 40 years later. Did my mom love him that whole time? Absolutely. But did that also cause her to be miserable and sacrifice a lot? Yes. A lot of high school relationships that last only last because two incompatible people get together and one of them, usually the woman, sucks it up and makes it work even though she's actually miserable. Please don't let your life be like my mom's. If he wants to be with you, and he's having ""issues"" and won't fix them, he needs to seek help NOW. Not later. Because you BOTH deserve to be happy. You also need to do some thinking, and it's really really hard to predict how life is going to go from here, but after 2 years together if he has disregarded your feelings toward being uncomfortable with intimacy. You need to consider what's best for yourself. 

I'm in my twenties and have been with my boyfriend for 1 and a half years and he has never done anything except respect my boundaries and uncomfortability with intimacy (yes, I have that problem too, unfortunately). In 1 and a half years nothing but respect. Consider that. Granted your guy still has a bit of growing up to do, you're both young, he could change. But *only if he's willing to change.*

I don't want to be that person who tells you to just break up with him, because I *don't* know the whole situation. I don't know what you two have been through together. But you're both old enough to start making serious decisions for the betterment of your life. Take some time to think about things thoroughly, and then you two need to have a talk about what you're going to do from here."

I would never have guessed that would happen if I asked a group of employees about their boss. Also why is this relevant to a sexual assault allegation against him?

rape,fqtwuux,t3_gktaj5,1589647657.0,"I am so sorry you had to experience this. Please, you shouldn't feel guilty at all for how you handled things. Drugs, trying to move on, etc. That's the same things anyone else would do. I did those things too. So did many of us on here. You look for any way you can to ease the pain. 

You've been through something very traumatic, and there isn't really any right way to act or be after something like that. But I promise the pain and awfulness of it can fade, and reaching out, like you did here, to support groups, or therapists, is a great first step. 
I highly recommend you seek out a trauma therapist. What happened to you was a trauma, and you should make sure you find someone with the proper training and education to guide you through this. 

I *highly* recommend you check out r/MenGetRapedToo
I haven't spent a lot of time there, but one of the mods there is someone I trust a lot and there's a lot of good material on that page that might help you.
You could also add r/rapecounseling to your list too. The folks over there are very supportive no matter your gender or situation. 

I hope you find the support you need. I'm so sorry that this is the way things happened. Just know any/all of these communities will be welcoming of you if you need it."
rape,fqrq06h,t3_gkhtzr,1589589452.0,"I would definitely try to pursue therapy if possible. A lot of therapists are doing virtual appointments right now, I would suggest trying again to see if therapist you already know can do virtual appointments, or try finding another therapist. Rape crisis centers can probably get you connected with an appropriate therapist who does virtual appointments. Another option (though of varying reputability) is Betterhelp, just make sure you get connected with a TRAUMA specific therapist through them. I had a very good experience with them but I know that isn't the case for everyone. Just trying to put options out there. 

Aside from that, I have had similar struggles. Unfortunately it can be hard to find something to make it easier to sleep, but one thing for me is sleeping on the couch with some child cartoons playing. I find cartoon shows really soothe me. That or How it's Made. But I used to watch How it's Made when I was home sick as a kid. So that's probably part of it. But I like it because if I have a nightmare or wake up scared the cartoons are right there and can connect me back with a feeling of safety and peace. And if I'm sleeping on the couch it's a change from the bed, where I have had the worst experiences with nightmares/sleep paralysis/waking up terrified and paranoid. 

I hope you find something that works for you soon. I'm so sorry you're having this struggle. I wish you the best."

meToo,fqqm9px,t1_fqqkrbz,1589567996.0,"If and only if she is proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that the accusation was false (read: she admits, in clear terms, that it was all a lie), I will then be enraged towards her and I firmly believe that false accusers (PROVEN FALSE ACCUSERS WHO ADMIT TO THEIR FALSE ACCUSATION) deserve just as high of punishment as we give rapists. 

The problem is, rape and sexual assault are INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO PROVE. It almost inevitably comes down to a he said/she said. It's unfortunate but lots of people who really get raped, honest to goodness got raped, don't have a shred of evidence to back them up. The first thing anyone wants to do after something like that, something they might not even accept for what it was yet,  is go take the longest hottest most scrubbing-your-skin-off shower that they can. Evidence is hard to come by. It's kind of the nature of this crime unfortunately. Also even if they do have DNA evidence, there will be the next step ""How do we KNOW it wasn't consensual?? She probably just regretted it."" And a bunch of other disgusting victim-blaming shit. Also contrary to popular belief the world is NOT rife with false rape accusations. So many people like to think that it's sooooo easy for someone to just say they got raped and everyone will believe them! Well it's fucking not. Almost every fucking rape survivor who has spoken about their experience ever has dealt with a LOT of disbelief. Because they can't prove it. And rapists are not monsters, or at least not obviously monsters. Their your friends, your coworkers, your family. And nobody wants to believe that their friends or family is capable of rape. So it's way easier to believe the victim is lying. Nobody wants to believe survivors. I'm sorry. But that's the way it is. That's why the metoo movement was so critical to so many survivors. And thats why it's important to believe somebody when they say they've been raped. 


As for Tara Reade, I've followed the case, I have seen literally no reason not to believe her. So, I believe her.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I don't know what you want me to say. If she says she lying, yeah, I'll be pissed. Because I believed her and she lied. But the chances that she's going through all this trouble (and undoubtedly the rape and death threats she's receiving) for a lie? For money? For whatever? Very slim.

Excuse me, what the actual fuck? How do I delete someone else's video

Your question: Am I happy about being a woman? I am happy to be me. I am happy that I can choose to wear pants or a dress without ridicule either way. I'm not happy that I got raped by a man who felt entitled to the bodies of women. I'm not happy that women's rights to their own bodies is regularly under dispute of government control. I'm not happy that the government doesn't seem to care about the sexual assaults that happen to women. I'm not happy that society seems to prefer sweeping sexual assault under the rug because it's too ugly for the masses to face. I'm not happy that I am seen as less of a leader because of my gender. I'm not happy about sexism. I'm not happy about misogyny. 

I am happy to be me though. I am happy to be able to wear the fashion that I choose. I'm happy to have the other amazing women that are in my life. I'm happy to be me exactly the way I am. So I guess my answer would be yes, I'm happy about being a woman, because that's what I am. But I am not happy about society. 

As for that fucking video. It's trash. Throw the whole thing out the window. Throw it into a dumpster and burn it. ""Has too much choice killed off contentment?"" Fuck no. I'm glad I have to choice to work in a male dominated field, because I like science and chemistry and working with my hands. I'm glad I have to choice to cut my hair short like a man, because it's easier to maintain with the hobbies I do and I think it looks quite stylish. I'm happy I have all the choices that are at my disposal. Holy shit I'm so fucking happy that I don't live in the fucking 50's. I'm so happy to have what I do. But fuck no I'm not satisfied with it. Because sexual assault against women is still out of control. Sexism is still present in my day to day life. Fuck that video. No I won't be happy until rape and misogyny are truly a thing of the past. We're on the right track but we've got a long ways to go."

I disagree with the other commenter about possibly being asexual. I don't think that's particularly relevant here. You shouldn't judge your sexuality by the way you responded to being raped. Like, what? 

You were coerced after you said no multiple times. Even if you felt like you wanted it at first, consent is enthusiastically given, not pressured out of people. 

Also I'm glad your girlfriend will be on your side during this. She seems like she will be understanding. A therapist would probably also help a lot. But what you choose to do from here is your decision."

I don't know all the specifics about how CBD interacts with the brain, but I know there's been a lot of testing on rats or mice that shows decreased anxiety.

rapecounseling,fpmpufk,t3_geajgm,1588738629.0,"You can move on if you wish, but recognize it might come back to bite you. Feeling like it wasn't real or didn't happen is a very very common response to trauma. And it might be okay for you to move on for a while, but please be cautious and maintain an awareness that it might come back in the future. 

I felt like that for a long time for me, but therapy helped a lot. For me it would switch. Some days it would feel like it wasn't real, like it was a dream, or I even described it by saying it was like I was remembering some one else's memories. But other days it felt like I was living a dream and I was gonna wake up at any moment to be back in my traumatic situation. Brains do weird things to separate us from the traumas we endured. 

I won't say that moving on is the wrong thing to do, because everyone is different, everyone processes things differently, and for you perhaps you will be able to process and move on just fine. But I would say to make a plan for if it doesn't, that way if it does come back at ya you have a plan in place. Look up TRAUMA therapists near you. Find one you can afford or one your insurance will cover, whichever. And keep the information for that person written down somewhere. Pick a few people who you trust as support and keep their numbers in mind as people you can reach out to in the future. You might be fine, but if it comes back, do what you can to be ready. That way you aren't left dealing with a lot of difficult emotions by yourself and without a clue where to start with finding a therapist."

rape,fnk5tlx,t3_g27mmf,1587015842.0,"I'm sorry to say, but... just laying on your back letting him do whatever *doesn't really sound like consensual sex to me*. 

So, because you say that *you* have nowhere to go during the pandemic, I'm assuming you moved in with him/it is his apartment? Or the dynamic is such that even though you're both on the lease it feels like his? I'm assuming this is the case. Otherwise you could just tell him to gtfo and go pound salt.

Now I want to ask you... What would happen if you just cut him off from sex? What would happen if you told him ""No. We're done. We aren't having sex anymore"". (*Even if you want sex, I don't think having sex with HIM is doing you any favors here*) 
How would he react? Is it likely that he would make you feel miserable for the rest of the time you're living with him? Do you both still sleep in the same bed even though you are ""no longer together""? Are you afraid he might *rape you again*? If that's the case I'm sorry to say it but none of this is consensual. There are a lot of complex power dynamics in situations like this. And if you are feeling pressure to keep having sex with him, and ""let him do as he wants"" and are afraid of how things might change if you didn't do that. That's coercion.

In the post title you call him your boyfriend, but in the text you call him your ""then boyfriend"" using past tense. I worry that you are stuck in a similar situation as I was with my rapist ex-boyfriend. I was done with that relationship for a long time before we were really *done*. Mostly because I also had no place to go. And I continued to have sex with him. I thought of it as consensual at the time but I would always feel *absolutely miserable* after. And I just didn't think about it. And carried on. Fast forward several months and I finally talk about it with my therapist and she brings up the same points I brought up here. ""What would he have done if I didn't?"" And that brought it all crashing down for me. 

I suggest looking into local domestic violence shelters, or rape crisis centers and see if they have anything open or available. Because staying in this situation is likely to just continue to hurt your mental health. 
I felt I didn't deserve that kind of shelter when I finally left my situation, and I lived out of my car for 3 months. I was homeless. And now I look back and realize those kinds of shelters are there for people in the situation I was. To make sure people aren't homeless trying to get away from the person who raped them. I promise you will be welcome there. 

I'm so sorry this happened to you. And I'm so sorry you're friends treated you the way they did. There's a saying somewhere, that abusers(or rapists) are just as good at grooming allies as they are at grooming victims. I promise you someday you will find a group of people who believe you and respect you. But until then you have those of us here. We hear you. We believe you.

I suggest finding a nearby pond in your area and see what's living there if you're bored just seeing what's under rocks, get to know your local ecosystems. 

I had a friend who once found one of those big yellow spotted salamanders in the area but I never had any luck finding one of those. I suggest branching out away from your house if possible.

You specifically said those things. You guys never discussed or agreed to having sex ahead of time. You never discussed or agreed to a threesome. He used those drugs to his advantage to get what HE wanted, because he knew he couldn't otherwise. Maybe he never intended for it to go that far, but considering he kept pushing more drugs at you I am led to believe otherwise. It went exactly where he wanted it to. And unfortunately, yes. This is rape. Regardless of how much or little you participated in what happened, you were very very seriously under the influence with no prior consent. This was not a consensual act. This was rape.


I understand you might not be in the best position to report him considering there was illegal drugs involved, maybe someone else here who has more experience with the law can advise. You could probably report him just on the basis that you were drunk, since even just drinking a lot without any other drugs involved is enough to cause someone to have blackouts/memory loss and lose their ability to consent. 

I hope your boyfriend is supportive of you during this time, it can be a very stressful and confusing time figuring things out after something like this. Especially when it's someone you trusted like a friend. I'm sorry this happened. I wish you the best moving forward."

Parks and Rec!!! An amazing comedy that I love so Soo much. I will forever be sad that it is over. 


Russian Doll, a more serious comedy, but I thoroughly enjoyed watching this show and would 100% watch it again. I do however caution people when watching it since there is nudity and an implied orgie (a bunch of nude people sleeping around this apartment after a party, it is implied to be 100% consensual) I think that's all there is if I remember correctly

Queer Eye!! I have a queer eye sticker on my water bottle with Jonathan saying ""Love yourself honey"". It is an emotional show though, my partner and I have taken to saying instead of ""Netflix and Chill"" we'll ask ""Queer Eye and Cry""? 

Also Bob Ross is on Netflix"

Bob's Burgers is also really good and goofy comedy (Hulu)

Nathan For You is some really really good but cringeworthy real world/reality comedy. This guy goes around and gives terrible business advice to actual businesses and uh, chaos typically ensues. Some of the stuff he's done actually made the news. I think the ""Dumb Starbucks"" episode is one of my favorites. (Hulu) 

On HBO I was watching His Dark Materials and I enjoyed that a lot (especially because I read the books as a teen) and that's good for a serious show if you have access to it

The Mandalorian on Disney+ is also a really good 'serious' show, if you have access to that one as well

Steven Universe is a really wholesome but serious cartoon show that I adore beyond all reason and I definitely recommend (Hulu)

I would recommend Adventure Time, but the creepy-ness of some of the characters might definitely be a no-no for some viewers who are sensitive to that. I think in the end there was only one episode that really bothered me in any way and I don't even remember which one it was. That's also on Hulu. 

I just recently started watching the anime One Piece and have been absolutely loving it so far, it just has this sort of childlike goofiness to it and is pretty light-hearted, plus there's like, a fuck-ton of it so I don't have to worry about running out of episodes anytime soon. (Hulu)

I would also reach out to a local domestic violence shelter or rape/sexual assault center. They know a lot of resources and can help provide support and help you with whatever you choose to do regarding this moving forward. They might also be able to help with therapy. 
I just started volunteering at my local sexual assault advocacy center prior to the Coronavirus and was surprised by exactly how much they do to help victims during their interactions with police/court. It wouldn't hurt to try and just see what they can do to help."

That being said, you should not feel ashamed at all. People like him purposefully put you in a position where you will see it as 'normal' and accept it, otherwise they probably wouldn't be able to get away with doing it for so long. And it can take a lot coming out of it to retrain your brain back to what is 'normal'. As you think back, you might even begin to notice times where he encouraged your view of this being 'normal'. The ways he acted and behaved around it. It wasn't normal, but it is his fault, his doing, his manipulative behaviors no matter how big or how small, that made it seem normal for so long. You should definitely look for a therapist. I recommend using something along the lines of betterhelp since everything is shut down right now, or contact local therapists and see if they can do video sessions. I would be sure to use tags like abuse/trauma when searching for a new therapist/counselor since what you've experienced falls into both categories, it will help you find a therapist better suited to the situation at hand. 

Please don't be ashamed. He twisted your reality, and it's his fault, not yours, that your perception of it was what it was for so long. That is the way abusers like him operate. I'm sorry that this has happened, but I'm incredibly glad you were able to find your way here and GET OUT before it got any worse. Because it would have, if you'd stayed.

What he did was not ok. He raped you. He abused you. I'm so sorry, but reaching out was the first step, and I'm so glad you did. Second step is to seek real-world help to get you out of your situation. 

Rape/sexual assault crisis centers are typically very friendly, so please don't be afraid to contact them. Centers can also help provide therapy/counseling. Looking into your local resources is your best bet. 

For now, are you safe, do you live with him? You need to separate yourself from him if possible. Your safety is paramount here and he has shown his true colors, a man who can and will rape his girlfriend. If you live with him and cannot escape, look into local domestic violence shelters, they can help you set up a plan and give you a place to stay. If you don't live with him, that's good. If he tries to come over, call the cops. He needs to stay away from you. Let someone you trust know the situation (which might be hard to find right now considering you just had your trust broken in a massive way). This can help protect you. Put yourself first.

You should not be going through and emptying your 25 yr old daughters drawers. That's an invasion of privacy, and that definitely has the ability to make somebody feel violated. I have been raped myself but I would 100% feel violated, yes, that word, violated, if my mom went through my drawers and emptied them. Even if there's nothing in there. It just reaffirms to me that I have no privacy or control. I am so sorry she said that to you, but what you did was not ok either. And I'm sorry. 

I would say, it seems, that that word in specific is a trigger for you. Also aside from using a word that specifically upset you, she said some unforgivably nasty things. She's an adult. She's moving out. Let her know that this hurt you deep. She's old enough she needs to own up for her actions. She needs to take responsibility for saying something truly awful. I'm not sure what to say that can help here except family therapy to help bridge the gap, assuming that you want to bridge it.

Do NOT let him pressure you into something you are uncomfortable with, something that *anyone* would be uncomfortable with. There is definitely a line between fantasy and reality. And he is not recognizing that. There are a lot of things I watch in porn that I would be FREAKED THE HELL OUT by if that were to happen in real life. I too get freaked out by the touch of someone who isn't my boyfriend/significant other.

The fact that he is seemingly ignoring your 'no's and continuing to push your boundaries is a huge red flag to me. You should sit him down and make it absolute crystal clear to him that you want your porn to stay fantasy and that's final. He needs to drop it now. What he's doing is blatantly disrespectful to you and he needs to STOP. I recommend taking this as seriously as you wish to. Want to cut him off from your sex life entirely?

From Wikipedia

Also although Domestic Violence specific shelters for men are rare, there are a couple that exist, and there are other types of shelters available. This is definitely a problem though, since there are many men who are victims of domestic violence who need these shelters that are not widely available. So there is for sure merit to this, but saying that there is none is an exaggeration.

ALSO women are also avoiding marriage AND having children and are ALSO criticized for it. That one isn't male specific at all, that's just a change of society that affects both men and women and most of the criticism comes from older generations where that was an expected part of their life. 

Also men have no reproductive rights?? What the fuck? 
Male circumcision is the only thing I can think of that fits that, and that is definitely something that should go. 

Men definitely have problems, and society has a lot of changes it need to make, especially surrounding domestic violence and rape of men and the social acceptance and support of men in those situations. 
Men's problems are already bad enough without having to add false stuff into it. 

Can't anybody just accept that men and women face different but terrible issues of their own? Why does this have to become a dick measuring contest. Women are disposable too. It just shows in different ways."

If he's going to try and manipulate you like that, you really shouldn't waste your time on him. Anyone who tries to manipulate you, in a romantic relationship or not, and with malicious intent or not, needs to keep away from you. Manipulation, by nature, is not a caring move, it's a selfish move. This is good advice for in general in your life. I know you care deeply for him and those emotional ties might make it hard to accept, but what he's doing is completely disregarding you and focusing completely on himself and spinning the situation so it puts him in the position of power, where he can call shots and he can be the one in the right.

You did excellent, but honestly there's nothing you can really do other than just continue what you've been doing. If you back off, she might interpret that as that you are no longer interested in her because of her past (a common fear of rape victims) but also don't be all over her about it either. I would follow up with a message asking if she's ok and telling her she's welcome to tell you about anything if she want to. And then leave it at that. Invite her back over to just hang out sometime and carry on as normal. It's very common for rape victims to have a lot of feelings of shame and embarrassment, rape is a very humiliating act. And many just don't want attention drawn to it. 

Express your support and that you're there for her is she needs it, and then just invite her to hang out as usual. I wouldn't press therapy just yet based of how you described her reaction. Give it time and I would say if something happens again OR if she does open up to you about it, that's when you ask her if she's already seeing a therapist. And if she says no, gently suggest that hey, she's been through something really awful, and a therapist might be able to help her feel better.

I'm really sorry this happened, and it sucks. A lot. Which is the understatement of the century right there. I think your first steps should be talking to a therapist about what happened, and if there is someone you trust, tell them about it too. It can be a hard subject to broach but it's doable. I typically let people know ahead of time that I want to talk to them about something serious, and ask if we can meet up to chat. And I recommend after the talk, maybe going out for coffee together or something. It can be very emotional to talk about these things (it is for me anyway) and going out and grabbing coffee or ice cream or something with your friend/trusted loved one can be a good way to collect yourselves after a heavy conversation. That's just my way of approaching it though.

Honestly, seeking a therapist should be your no.1 goal, they can help you navigate your emotions after something like this. There can be a lot of confusion and uncertainty, having a balanced educated person to bounce your thoughts off can do wonders."

So far it's helped me manage it well enough, but it won't really ever go away until the trauma is dealt with. My therapist knows I'm reading this book and we've talked about it a bit to, and the reality is, you can learn to manage it, but it will be work. If you work on your trauma the anger will fade on its own. She said anger is one of the trademark symptoms of PTSD so she's really not surprised I'm struggling with this. 

I recommend reading books on anger management and working with a therapist. But it is 100% normal to feel a lot of anger and a lot of that comes from your PTSD."

rape,fibo2oc,t3_f7iek8,1582326170.0,"Please, hang in there, college is an incredibly stressful time and I'm so sorry. I was raped after I graduated college and I can't imagine going through what I went through while still in college. I want you to know, in college you can have extra time on homework/exams due to ""extenuating circumstances"". Talk to a school counselor at least once, I encourage it, they can help you communicate to your professors and take advantage of the rule about extenuating circumstances and give you a little break and some leniency/flexibility. I had to use that in college for other circumstances (my mom was suicidal and in and out of the hospital and it was taking a huge mental toll on me) and I was able to have extra time to finish homework assignments and was able to reschedule and take tests outside of class in the testing center (which was a wayyyy way better testing environment in my opinion). 

I highly encourage talking to a counselor just once, if that's all you can manage (which is totally ok, this is going to be heavy stuff, and I'm terribly sorry for that, just making it to one appointment might be difficult enough at this stage) and tell them about your circumstances and don't be afraid to tell them you need help. And don't be afraid to tell them you can't do regular appointments. They'll understand. They might even be able to show you other opportunities and resources that are at your disposal that you would have never known about otherwise. 

I encourage you, please don't give up. It hurts, I know it hurts. It's damn near unbearable. And it's heavy. But if you can stick it out, it does get better. And it can get better in ways you didn't even realize. There's a lot of power for evil in this world but there's a lot of power for good too. And you'll find a lot of good people here, ready to listen and give advice and share what we've learned. Or even just there to sympathize. I hope you feel welcome coming back here. This is a burden that harder to carry when you feel alone."

Trauma & Recovery by Judith Herman was an amazing book on trauma that changed a lot for me

In a similar vein, The Body Keeps the Score is also a good book on trauma but a tougher read


On a non-clinical note

Tess of the Road is a book that hit me really hard and I've re-read parts of it multiple times. It's a fantasy novel about at girl who grew up in a really conservative religious household and was raped and rather than do what society/her family wants her to do she disguises herself as a man and goes on a journey across the country. Along the way you really see her struggle and how she handles it and you see how much she changes over her journey. It was a really inspiring book for me. It's the 3rd book in a series (Seraphina is the first book) and the whole series includes some really wonderful stuff, with the second book featuring a very manipulative antagonist that I thought was done in a very good way. The books are very progressive and sensitively written and meant for young adults. And the author herself pretty much said in an interview that she had been through abuse herself. I own Tess of the Road and hope to save up and get the rest of the series sometime."

Actually, if you're interested, I could buy you a copy of the book.

I'm really really sorry you're going through this. I personally get like, anger outbursts when people approach me and I'm in a leave-me-alone headspace. Dogs are so amazing and it can be nice to talk to certain people about dogs but that doesn't mean I want everybody and their brother coming up to me on the street to pet my dog and talk about them. I also recommend trying to get your dog to be an emotional support animal, I don't think it's terribly hard to do. And you know what, even if you don't, you're WELL within your rights to just put a vest on your dog that says ""Do Not Pet"" anyway. Anything that can help deter all the attention."

rape,fi29ce6,t3_f5zbpm,1582074487.0,"I do agree with the sentiment of ""All People Are Trash"" and feel that way often, but I have so far opened up to several people and had good responses. I think the key is just slowly opening up to people you trust until you have a support system of sorts in place of people who know and believe you and then it's easier to tell others. I've personally found a lot of relief from talking about it. I realize this is not the case for everyone. But I don't think people should be scared out of talking like this. 

I'm sorry you had such a bad experience, and that talking about it almost killed you. But holding it in and keeping it shut in and never telling anyone can, honestly, be fatally harmful to someone else. 

I think I would have killed myself if I hadn't started opening up about it, and the positivity and support I received from my friends has helped me heal in so many ways. 

Everyone has different experiences and different things that work for them. But you shouldn't scare people out of talking like this. I'm sorry, and if you need to vent about your experience, please do so. We're all right here with you. But please, this only silences other victims who really NEED to talk about."
ptsd,fhxxulr,t1_fhxue6w,1581964551.0,"Trauma is pretty heavy stuff, just by the nature of it. I also think interviewing anyone privately isn't the best. If you're interested in learning more about PTSD, there is plenty of reading material. Bessel Van Der Kolk has a very educational (if dark at times, be warned) book on PTSD called The Body Keeps The Score. You could potentially read from that or do research of your own online and still cover the topic of PTSD but maybe not in such a victim-direct way. 

If you need any recommendations on websites about PTSD, feel free to let me know. I'm at work today but I'll think over it while at work and when I go on break I can update with some of the best sources I can think of.

PTSD is important, and plenty of children/younger-people deal with PTSD as well. There might even be people in your own class who are dealing with PTSD and you don't even know it. So I actually encourage you to do a project on PTSD and learn about it and teach others, so maybe see if you can change the goal of your project a little bit, but still keep the topic on PTSD.

Please do not hesitate to ask for assistance if you'd like some. I've done a lot of reading and research on PTSD myself, I'm bound to know of at least a couple useful websites or sources I can send you to. I want to reiterate, Bessel Van Der Kolk is a very good and credible source of information on PTSD. Judith Herman would also be a good source to look into for information."
ptsd,fhxutav,t3_f52uc3,1581962749.0,"I go to the bathroom, or if it's too bad, like if I am straight up breaking down and crying I leave work early and go home. In college I went to the counselors office, and I had a professor who would let me use their office if I just needed someplace to sit alone and cry. Outside of work, hiding in a public bathroom stall or go sit in my car parked facing away from people or parked off to the side or someplace out of the way. I can text my therapist if I need to, along with my boyfriend, and I also have a friend who has welcomed me to message her whenever I need to. 

Sometimes I'm too scatterbrained by my flight/fight/freeze to actually do any of those things and at those points if gets tough because I'll just kind of pace around aimlessly in a panic not knowing where to go until I find a quiet place to 'hide' so to speak and from there I'll make my way to one of the above mentioned places once I've gotten my bearings."

What grade level is this project?  

Is there someone who can be contacted to verify the project? (If you're in grade school, this would be more understandable but there should still be some kind of structure here more than just some rando coming in here asking for stories.)

ptsd,fht1yqx,t3_f4oixq,1581868916.0,"Nope, Trauma seems to have been present during most if not all of history. I'm seeing a lot of speculation in this thread. I hope people take the time to read this. 

Judith Herman's book Trauma and Recovery goes into great detail covering the history of women's PTSD from sexual trauma being written off as hysteria. She looks at the information from several women Freud worked with and notes that they are displaying the trademark symptoms of PTSD, though Freud refers to it as Hysteria. Women in older times were not taken seriously (big surprise). I highly *highly* recommend this book to anyone, as it is fantastic information. And to give her some credit, I assume many of you have heard of Bessel Van Der Kolk by now, from The Body Keeps The Score? Van Der Kolk references Judith Herman's work in that book. I recommend both Trauma and Recovery and TBKTS to anyone wanting to learn more about PTSD and trauma.

Next, military trauma and PTSD were likely occuring as well. There are many interpretations of old battle records, but there seems to be indication of PTSD.

relationship_advice,fhpevdb,t1_fhoka2d,1581787967.0,"I'd like to take a moment to say yeah, I cherry picked *a smaller number*. In the past couple years the number of rapes in the USA have actually been higher than 300,000. I figured I'd go with a more conservative number. I see now you are in denial. I'm sorry you are having a hard time seeing this. 

I don't want to call you anything villainous, I'm really not looking for a fight. I just want you to understand the ways that myself and many *many* other women suffer. And no, it's not all men. I have a wonderful boyfriend and several male friends who are splendid people. But none of them deny the reality of what women go through. We've all had deep talks about this sort of stuff in our circle, and it can be amazing how different men and women experience life. You haven't seen it or experienced it, so you are insisting it doesn't exist. But it's there. It's dark and insidious and completely entirely present. And by denying there's any problem at all, you're kind of part of the problem. 

🌟Anecdote Time🌟 
I suspect you're bitter or feel slighted in some way. Maybe you live someplace that's really centered around women and supporting women. Maybe you've lived a very unprivileged life and don't see why women should get any help. And I'm sorry if that's the case, I'm sorry if it sucks for you too. I don't want life to suck for anyone. But I want you to know, even in the United States, cultures change just a couple hours away. I grew up rural. I grew up Baptist. I was told my duty was to have children and please my husband. I was told to wear floor length skirts and that my body was sinful. I was told to stay quiet and smile. I was told that women don't enjoy sex. I grew up in a very sexist environment. And I never wanted any of that, I always loved science and asked a lot of questions and wasn't interested in marriage or children. I moved away from there and I met a man who took advantage of my ignorance of the world (since previous to that I thought compared to the Baptist Church, the rest of society seemed super progressive, and sexism was gone) and he raped me. I later moved elsewhere to a place that's incredibly supportive of rape victims and even more progressive of a society and I now see how much sexism there was where I previously lived. Sexism at my previous jobs that I don't deal with now. And better friends who understand me. And a boyfriend who also doesn't want children and who also loves science and we can nerd out on stuff together. You don't see the same reality that I do. And you won't, because it probably won't happen right on front of your face. But it'll happen 2 hours away in a town you've never heard of."
