TattooDesigns,fr6nxaj,t3_gmjnuj,1589929775.0,"Really fabulous work! The attention to the shading in the sculpture’s hair and beard is fantastic.
My only constructive criticism would be to remember the planes and 3D forms of the face, and think about how they would catch the light. The nose looks a little flat, the eye on the right side of the composition is a little stretched, and there’s no transition from the eye to the cheekbone on that side of the face. The forms on the left side of the face look really great, and the eye looks recessed into the face behind the brow-bone and cheek-bone. If you repeat those sensibilities on the other side of the face, it’ll look even better. Hope that makes sense, and good luck!"

This didn’t happen to me on mushrooms actually, it happened from weed (two separate times, not insane dosages or anything). The most insane part about it is that this weed was gotten from a medical dispensary in California so I KNOW that shit couldn’t have been laced with anything. Apparently I was screaming bloody murder and flailing the whole time. I’m really glad my partner and two friends were there to take care of me during those hours. I’ve had weed before, so idk why it kills me like this now.

Kind of a bummer too, because I wanted to try mushrooms or LSD. Now though? I’m good. Probably won’t ever get high again. Which really sucks. I wish I could use weed to manage my anxiety and real psychedelics to trip like a normal person."

CPTSD,fqxb4fz,t1_fqx41dc,1589729265.0,"My sessions are 1 hour with my therapist.

Maybe I need to do the visual EMDR more, but it’s just so intense and my whole body shakes so much that it pulls me out of the EMDR. Anyways it’s a lot like free association. 

I’d suggest CBT before diving into EMDR. Your therapist will be able to do both, if you get a trauma therapist. They never start you before you’re ready though, as doing it too soon in the path to recovery can be retraumatizing and hurt more than it helps. I’ve had huge improvements in my life since starting EMDR about 6 months ago. After hitting it really hard and doing a lot of hard work, my therapist and I kinda stepped back from it a bit because I was starting to work too hard at it and was diving too deep and really close to retraumatizing myself. After sessions there’s also a period of care, of returning to baseline, and then gently becoming a person again. I highly, highly recommend it."
shrooms,fqx9os7,t1_fqx5e98,1589728603.0,"I once lived more lives than this in a trip before. it was pure hell— but also incredibly important?

It started with a really intense ego death, starting from timeless absolute non existence, and then re-learning the 4 dimensions one at a time, learning what color is, and love, and every other idea, and then an eternity of pain after learning that there was an “I” and that “I” had a body. (that could feel pain. So much pain.) That “I” needed to make the body start breathing again or “I” would fucking die (and then learning what death is) at the beginning, then eternal time loops. 

I lived every life that has ever been lived, then I became the single electron that exists in the universe and lived through all of its infinite lives. And when I thought it was done, the universe exploded again and started all over. I swear to god I have experienced the Big Bang. 
At some points I could feel my synapses firing and felt how the brain works in binary (either a synapse is firing or it isn’t). Shit was so hard, man. After living so many lives and being stuck in time loops for so long and being shown so much, after I came down... I have experienced extreme existential dread before, but I could only explain what I felt then as existential exhaustion. Exhaustion so deep, and so much fear of continuing to experience it, and the stark, unfiltered knowledge of how it’s all an inherently meaningless existential joke— like a formal exercise or a script that was being run through because it had to be. 

I have wanted to die pretty regularly before the trip (severe depression will do that to you) but I’m so afraid of dying now, because I don’t want the cycle to continue. I don’t want my consciousness to keep existing after I die, and the knowledge that the suffering won’t stop when I die is the scariest, worst fate I can possibly imagine. God, it was hell, and I’ve already been through it. And god, the migraines I’ve had since then have been brutal. All the new paths blazed in my brain, and I can feel ‘em all.

Anyways, tl;dr is please God I hope nobody ever tries to eat that many mushrooms in one sitting. I know it’s a joke, and it would be impossible anyways, but FUCK, MAN. 

Sorry I don’t know why I wrote all this, guess I’m still processing what I went through. Sometimes I feel like I can still see it all, like I could pull the thin silk of reality away from my eyes and just spin there forever, and sometimes I feel like I’m falling back into that eternal, universal consciousness as I’m falling asleep and I just really fucking hope I don’t.

If any of y’all have ever been through anything like this and has any advice about how to cope with it I’d really like to know— I’ve told my therapist about it but she wasn’t any help in this case."

ArtFundamentals,fqnfyu2,t3_gjnq12,1589494162.0,"I don’t want to come across as a drawabox fanatic, but your question is actually addressed in lesson two! In this case, I really agree with what they’re saying, the tl;dr boils down to the idea that constructional drawing IS an observational process— one that involves understanding the basic forms that come together to create the object you’re looking at. Here’s the excerpt and the link to it:

“Often when I see students discussing different approaches to drawing, observational drawing and constructional drawing are presented as a sort of dichotomy - two techniques that are mutually exclusive. This really isn't true. Constructional drawing inherently incorporates observation, as we cannot know which simple forms to start with unless we observe our subject matter carefully. Observational drawing can be done without construction, but if you ask me, that is an approach that is fundamentally incorrect.

Construction is all about understanding how an object exists in 3D space as a part of the drawing process. If you are doing this - even if not as explicitly as we do here - you are employing an element of construction.

If, however, you are working only in two dimensions - for example, drawing from a photo reference (photographs are by nature two dimensional) and reproducing it in your drawing directly without considering the fact that the photo represents a three dimensional scene, then there is no component of construction and in all likelihood your drawing will appear flat and unconvincing. Yes, you may eventually become an exceptional photocopier, but we do have machines for that already, and the applications for that skill set are fairly limited these days.

This is why if you have learned any observational drawing in the past, you may have heard discussion over whether or not it is okay to use photo references, or if only drawing ""from life"" (with the actual object in front of you) is valuable. In my experience, this is because it is considerably more difficult for a beginner to look at an actual three dimensional object without some degree of understanding or consideration for how it sits in 3D space. You're effectively forced to somehow process that 3D object into your 2D drawing.

I have generally found that when employing constructional techniques, like those taught here, it doesn't matter as much whether you draw them from life or not. There are still benefits to drawing an object from life, and if you have the means or the opportunity you absolutely should do so, but these techniques do help significantly reduce the pitfalls that come from working with 2D references.”

After your call with her it’s very clear that your mother at the very best doesn’t care about your boundaries and safety and at the very worst is actively hoping that her friend sexually assaulting you will “turn you straight.” Call your landlord TODAY and get him to do a “random check,” or else leave. Speaking as a (male) victim of sexual assault, this is NOT something to fuck around with or get cold feet about for the sake of politeness or smoothing things over. Hell, if my experience can be used as an example, losing all financial support from your parents would be better than being sexually assaulted by this woman, which is 100% her plan.

I’m so, so sorry you’ve been put in this situation. You need to really carefully look at your relationship with your parents, too. Them knowing about this and gaslighting you about it or even being actively involved in it is abusive behavior. There are a lot of ways to handle abusive parents who you are financially dependent on, although it’s really shitty and not easy. Can you stay with your boyfriend until this woman is forced to leave? 

Look into local centers for domestic violence. There are resources for you if you need them. Do not let this woman hurt you. As others have said, you are actively in GRAVE danger. 

I’m rooting for you, and again, I’m so sorry you’ve been put into this situation."

The piece is an important work of feminist art, but the women of color represented in this piece have had all vaginal features removed from their plate, which engages in the long and racist history of oversexualizing and desexualizing black women/women of color in general. Additionally, representing women by their vaginas alone is essentialist and has long been a form of transphobia and excluding trans women from the feminist movement.

It’s certainly a product of its time, and is still a triumph. But /every/ piece of art should be analyzed through a critical eye. If we want to make the world better through our art, we need to have a nuanced understanding of the shortcomings of previous activist art so we don’t repeat the same mistakes. 

Also, I don’t think including all women would have muddied the message of this piece, even for the ‘70s. It’s very clear that this piece is representing women, and it still would be if she had included trans women, more women of color, and hadn’t desexualized the ones she did represent.

sticknpokes,fo3h8g1,t1_fo37vm9,1587486863.0,"It’s just blue and white ink! I had five caps, and mixed a series of tints from undiluted dark blue all the way to the palest sky blue. More caps will make your job easier, but I got this effect by “feathering” each shade into the shade next to it. The pigments/dots kinda mix as you apply them. Try practicing with colored pencils first maybe, I feel like that was really helpful practice for me and it feels like the different colors of ink mix together on the skin the same way as two different shades of colored pencil mix together on the page to make a different color. Sorry if I’m not making much sense or if I’m giving too much info— I didn’t sleep last night because I was doing this lmao"
