AskRedditAfterDark,fp23ijx,t3_ga9qz0,1588254396.0,"Uh no. I don't miss the innocence and awkwardness of high school sex... That's actually kind of creepy. I much prefer thinking about mature sex, with a mature partner."
SingleParents,fp0swjb,t3_ga8sau,1588216188.0,"Kids are exhausting at that age. 
Just remember it's only temporary. 

I'm a single mother of a 6 year old boy without any sort of relief from literally anyone hardly ever. 

Sometimes we get tired and feel this way. It's okay. 

But, you have to remember that at the end of the day you made the decision to have and keep them. They didn't ask to be here. And you have a responsibility to be strong for them as they are only children and need your strength and guidance. 

I'm also sorry their dads suck. 
They're better off without them so I'd probably try to accept that and just do your best!"

depression,foqexcp,t3_g8eq07,1587991928.0,"First of all, I'm sorry for her, you, and everyone involved because of this absolutely selfish and senseless act. 

Everything that you're feeling is completely normal. 

I do believe that it will remain this way until after the trial more than likely so please just hang in there. You can do it, and she'd want you to. Though, I think we can all say based on your testimony of her that she would understand too.  

After the trial I think will definitely be when the healing process actually starts. 

That's the closing to this all. 

It really is just looming overhead waiting to be 'resolved' which is awful. 

But sentencing the perpetrators, and knowing one day they too will get theirs in the shit hole that is life in prison and ultimately die there as a caged animal. 

I'm not sure if you're a religious person or not, I am not organized anyway, but I do believe malicious people capable of committing a horrific murder such as this will absolutely find themselves without any sort of salvation in the afterlife. They will go to whatever the fuck hell they deserve while your beautiful, wonderful girlfriend is sitting in paradise patiently waiting. 

I can't guarantee you any comfort but if the grieving process is correct you will recover from this and live out the remaining part of your years while she lives sweetly in your memory. 

I've had a friend die from suicide and I'm going to be the first to say this even though I don't know you but, you're not going to do that! 

You are loved by many. You are loved by us. 
And that would not make her very happy with you I'm sure! 

Please reach out whenever you need to. 

And please take care of yourself. 
Eat something. Shower. Shave. Clean up a bit if you can. It will help to get a routine going again. 

Little steps friend. You can do this."

TrueOffMyChest,fm6zj23,t3_ft9fi6,1585808041.0,"Please know that just because you're gay, doesn't mean you have to lump yourself in with ALL the gays, or anyone at all for that matter.  

You are YOU! 

Not a fucking can of soup! 

Just because you're gay doesn't mean you can't have conservative views about it. 

My sister is a true lesbian and quite frankly she can't stand her 'own' community. 

Once she realized that, she just started living her life. 
Setting her standards and hanging out with like minded people. 

I'm sorry you want to be cured. 

Please just keep the faith that, there's someone out there who's values totally and completely match to yours, and you will find each other one day. 

You're intelligent. 
You will sort through these thoughts and find a way to manage your life man. 

It takes time though. 

This only makes you stronger and wiser!"
RoastMe,flrc5l5,t3_fq7yr6,1585417237.0,You definitely look like the typical psycho bitch that would hit your ex then call the police on him saying he hit you.
depression,fjgleub,t3_fd6x14,1583329846.0,I scooped him out of his bed last night while he was sleeping and put him in my bed with me. I just cuddled him and cried. Told him I loved him and I'm so sorry for everything. I did that before he went to bed too. But I just felt this need to keep apologizing to him and be close to him. I love him so much. I don't want him to ever hurt or be sad. Let alone grow up all sad and fucked up like me.
confession,fjc4tou,t3_fcmzlm,1583208626.0,"I feel like a lot of kids do this for a reason. 
1. So you didn't get in trouble as a kid.
2. So you fit in. 
3. So you're 'cool.' 
And for whatever other reasons it may be. 
I was kind of the same as a young teen. 
I realized as I got older that it was all circumstantial. 
I was bullied as a kid. My mom was abusive emotionally and physically, my dad didn't seem to care at the time. My sister was troubled. I had to be exposed to a bunch of shit I shouldn't have. I realized my lying was definitely to make my life appear more interesting than what it was. Which it basically was just not good. 
Eventually you will realize that there is no point in living under false pretenses. Eventually you will be who you're meant to be and you will be confident in that. 

People are going to love you for you. 

And just don't ever forget that you are a very unique person unlike anyone else in the planet. You're special! So just be as happy and healthy as you can be and be honest with yourself always. Forgive yourself always. 
And just go with the flow. Life is full of phases. You'll forget about this one day."
