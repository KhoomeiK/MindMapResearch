hsp,fpepml4,t3_gcy3sn,1588552256.0,When I'm feeling bad I tend to distance myself from others so as not to spread my negativity. It's not healthy for me to isolate but I don't want to dump it on other people either.
FragileWhiteRedditor,fpeoo8w,t3_gcrx9c,1588551681.0,"It looks like the bottom picture shows the lesser upvoted comments. There would've been kind ones at the top, just like in the top picture
Still not ok for any users to be saying these things about the Chinese doctor, but this image isn't a fair comparison"
BingeEatingDisorder,fpb2ooo,t3_gcc0cz,1588460846.0,"I've been binging on & off for 6 years (I'm 22) but have always known the right thing to do is to stop. When I last a long time without binging, I get this weird mix of accomplishment and missing it. Binge eating was so comforting, like a friend when I had no one. It's hard to let go of a friend who helped you through tough times but I look to real people now for support in my recovery."

BingeEatingDisorder,fjwnthc,t3_feydfm,1583641722.0,"Great job! I love looking at the whole week to see that even though I have higher calorie days it all averages out to a normal intake. In the past I had a narrow mindset where I looked at each day in isolation, so when I ate more than usual I'd freak out and binge."

depression,fheq4vh,t3_f2qwaw,1581527615.0,I'm going through this and often get so embarassed by my stupidity I want to keep away from others. It also takes a big hit to my self esteem. I really value intelligence in other people so to lose it in myself has made me lose self-respect. It wouldn't be so bad if I'd always been this stupid but the marked decline leaves me mourning my past self.
BingeEatingDisorder,fgdf91p,t3_exthtk,1580681838.0,"Yupp... I could spend $100 on binges all in the one day, and none of it was dining in (all grocery items/takeaway)."

Sometimes it really does feel like I'm trying to purge my very being, driven by self-hatred and anger directed inwards"
vhemt,f4za9eb,t1_f4z9fob,1571901748.0,"I'm a woman, not a sir. What choice am I placing in the hand of an adopted child? The choice to procreate? They have that choice regardless of whether they get adopted or not.
Like I said, I don't believe everything would go as planned, and I would be ok if it didn't. Adoption means less suffering for the adopted child because they have parents to look after them."
vhemt,f4z8eqe,t1_f4v5kmc,1571899343.0,"The adopted child who procreates would have done so regardless of their orphan status.
At least you could educate the child on environmental/philosophical issues that point towards antinatalism (not in a forced way though. If they end up wanting to procreate I wouldn't disown them lol)."

gainit,f2zahdl,t3_devk1r,1570512211.0,"Try making some calorie dense shakes or bars that you can easily take on the go to work and even have at your desk. Nut butter, dried fruit, oats, protein powder, etc as ingredients"

bulimia,esgzm3y,t3_c7q7oj,1561975494.0,I do! It's been over 2 weeks since I last b/ped but I had a dream the other night of eating biscuits dipped in icing. It was such a relief to wake up and know my streak was still intact.

bulimia,es2r50p,t3_c5f5fv,1561536010.0,Counting the days can be counterproductive as it assumes that there will come a day when you fail and can build up pressure. It may work for some but it didn't for me
