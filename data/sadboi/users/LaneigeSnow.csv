UnsentLetters,eq6lpjr,t3_bxbh80,1559831371.0,Thank you for writing my thoughts.
SuicideWatch,eq3yjsi,t3_bx5ifd,1559765508.0,I know exactly how you feel and I have the exact same thoughts you do. Hoping you can find light at the end of the tunnel in whichever decision you make.
awardtravel,eq3xj7i,t3_bx3t3c,1559764953.0,"After travelling to a few places in the past month via business, the lounge imo is only good if the airport is trash/you’re not into duty free shopping/want a quiet place to relax away from people/enjoy the complimentary food, which is usually the case. 

Since you’re in Singapore, I highly recommend you to check out Singapore’s newest airport mall known as Jewel. Spectacular views and sights, a wide array of delicious well-knowned international foods for you to choose from that you probably won’t find at the lounge. It would take no longer than 15-20 mins to reach after you exit from the transit area. Locals visit the place as an attraction itself so I’d say it’s worth your time than just hanging around the lounge."

learnfrench,eq3rbo3,t3_bx3grh,1559761513.0,"Thanks for the video! If you can, probably for the next video make it a little slower or repeat each sentence twice? Speaking from a beginner’s POV but very good content nevertheless."
depression,epiywal,t3_buq56r,1559244753.0,"You also forgot the sleepless nights that you thought was just a bad sleeping schedule. You forgot the nightmares that crawl in, the bad scenes that play in your head like a theatrical show that would not end."
smallbusiness,eougnf7,t3_bt67ki,1558866131.0,"In a small town, the population is small and your target population may be even smaller which is why you may feel it isn’t as well received as you would like it to be.

Try reaching out to more people outside of that area if you can."
depression,eoud8od,t3_bt2of4,1558863014.0,Happy birthday! wishing you all the best for the good that’s yet to come.
