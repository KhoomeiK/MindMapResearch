AskMen,fmmptfa,t1_fmmgytr,1586209782.0,"Girl here too and support this 100%! There’s nothing more annoying than a guy just texting for the sake of texting when they have nothing to say.
You can leave it alone for a bit, and text her when you have something to say or share...it can be personal, or just a current event that’s happening like “did you hear about such and such thing happening? Crazy huh?”
Don’t overthink it, keep it natural"

abusiverelationships,f3cg0c1,t3_dgj28e,1570823631.0,"I (F34)literally went through the same thing and would be happy to share my experience.
I essentially was married for a long time, got separated and met my current bf about six months after. We clicked right away, but I though it was too soon, my ex was very abusive.
But I am the “what the hell” type of person and went full in with my bf. It’s been great and we now live together. 

However, in retrospect I would have go in but slowed waaaay down, the poor man has had to deal with some of my traumas and it has taken A LOT of work, patience and love. 
Hope this helps"
sex,f2kv3yn,t1_f2fcmqf,1570289540.0,Thanks!! He can’t have sex more than once and he doesn’t really tell me what he likes although when I am giving him a BJ I tell him i’ll do whatever he wants so long he tells me. Nada.
sex,f2kup39,t1_f2gxx9c,1570289439.0,"I have, he says that what I do is fine and that he is happy with our sex life and relationship. But he cannot perform more than once and he is super quiet during sex, so I feel I should do more? I also want to do more but I am really not that experienced."
AskWomenOver30,f28mvl3,t3_dcgv9h,1570065580.0,"I would dump my bf before we got married the year after. Still move out of my mom’s before she kicked me out and finish college. I would save as much as I can, try to go back to competitive swimming and just make better life choices, instead of ending up as a divorced 34yo F with PTSD from an abusive marriage of 14 years. I would date more men to so I could learn how to handle relationships better, and would work on my self-esteem and finances."

I am cheering for you, keep pushing forward"
AskWomenOver30,f0wn6zk,t3_d6x81t,1569010380.0,"Wake up at 4am, workout from 5-7 am. Get to the office and work 7:30-3:30, get home, make food, eat and chill for a couple of hours with the bf. Then we go to boxing from 7-8, and groceries after (if needed) or just come back straight home and prep stuff for the next day, and bed at 10. 
I usually see friends, family and such on Fri, Sat or Sun and those I can’t see, I call them in the afternoon after work. We clean after ourselves always, but clean the house usually Sunday mornings? 
It’s not that hard."

After I left he begged and promised that he would change but in the same convo he would turn abusive as always and I knew it was over."

You're like, what have you done since the first time until now that you just keep having the same issue, AND why keep coming to me if you're not even going to try the 100 solutions I suggested? If all they want is to vent I'm all for it, but if you ask for advise, different story."
sex,eylxlrx,t1_eyl21ov,1567194450.0,Seriously!! My bf is quiet as a mouse and I HATE IT! There is no bigger turn on than a vocal guy when you blow him
sex,eyez3y3,t1_eydhfed,1567041081.0,"Thanks for the advice! I went out with a guy a few months after I separated but we never had sex...I didn’t feel like it, and we didn’t last long anyway. And now, my bf and I are actually living together (almost a month now) and this has been bothering me for a while just don’t even know how to approach it or maybe I thought it’s normal but because I don’t know anything else to me it’s weird? Now it’s turning into a big thing for me because i’ve been bottling up. I have anxiety to bring up the subject to him for some reason.
He says he’s very happy with our sex life but never asks me too..."

AskWomen,eyd0el6,t1_eycmnyn,1567009417.0,"Thanks for this! I always wondered how to do them properly. I swear I feel like I am already lose and I am only 34 but maybe that is just my overthinking. Still, I always end up tensing my thighs or butt instead of the muscles inside so these tips help. How long does it take to feel the difference? I almost don't feel these muscles when I try but I guess with time they will get stronger?"
depression,eycyufr,t3_cwl19g,1567008814.0,Same... and I feel that if something was to happen to me literally no one would care. It would just be a win win for everyone.
AskWomen,eycw748,t3_cwj6s4,1567007688.0,"I ended two friendships this year. One with my best friend since I was 5 and the other one with my best guy friend and only man I could trust. Both had to be done for different reasons...It still devastating to this day, especially my BFF.

Just let the feelings flow and remind yourself why you had to do it. It hurts like hell but if there is anything or anyone in your life who doesn't bring you happiness and is toxic, they need to be removed. I send you healing vibes =)"
sex,eycjs4z,t1_eya37p0,1567002965.0,omg after reading all these comments I wonder how do you girls do this? Maybe my muscles are not strong enough? Am I already lose? the sadness....
