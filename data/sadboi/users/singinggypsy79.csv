ptsd,fixa8vv,t3_fa5o43,1582816262.0,"We all wish that our lives could be ""normal"", and not have to deal with our heads and emotional responses post trauma(s). I have Complex PTSD and its a constant daily battle, but I have to expect that this is MY ""normal"" anymore, and learn how to live now accordingly. Its completely exhausting trying to heal, while constantly replaying events in your mind, and putting on a mask and for everyone you come in contact with. Meeting new people and seeing them on a semi regular basis is when its really hard bc naturally you start sharing some things, and there are parts missing, that we can't share bc its TOO much. When my husband and I were dating and about to start sleeping together, I had to somehow warn him about my nightmares and that I wake up 3-5 times a night in panic completely drenched from sweat, without completely freaking him out. Luckily, after we did the deed, he slept really hard, and so I just pretty much stayed up all night bc of his snoringüòÇüòÇ. I eventually had to tell him after I woke him up having a panic attack in my sleep one night.  I explained to him that I have ptsd, and that there are times that I'm doing okay, and times not so much. I can't turn off my subconscious, so it comes out in my sleep. He hugged me and said he loved me and wants me to feel safe. Cue the tears lol. Over our relationship, I do still have nightmares, but the sweats have mostly subsided. My daily life, I have good days/weeks, and bad ones, recently a really bad few weeks. I've let him in on bits and pieces of some of it, but there's too much, and I dont want to relive it by talking about it. At first he was like why dont you trust me enough to let me in, and I was honest and said, I don't trust ANYONE. Not one person. I do trust him more than anyone now, but will never fully trust any human. If I am having a rough day, I tell him. I usually either get really despondent and numb and quiet, or I am in hypervigilant mode where I'm panicking and on overdrive. He really does try to help me through my episodes even if he doesn't know all of the details or the complex nature of this disorder. He reads articles on how to help me through it and that in itself is amazing to me. I'm so very blessed with him. So my advice is, try to limit yourself from oversharing too many details until you are COMPLETELY comfortable doing that. Some people can't handle hearing what we've been through or the after effects. Let them know that you have this disorder, and are actively processing and healing from your trauma. You are trying to move forward to have a great life, but at times, it gets rough. Tell them you dont want to focus on the bad, but its that way sometimes bc of our brain trying to protect us from more trauma. Sorry for the book, hope it helps some."

I have been using marijuana for years, recreationally at first, but now as medicine (40f). I always get an indica, like some of the other redditors have mentioned, bc the sativa makes you get in your head more, and indica calms your body. I dont really get a huge head buzz really at all, but that may be from years of use. But for my anxiety, and especially for sleeping with night terrors every night, it helps quiet the mind some.

She needs to be in regular therapy to process how her life has been up to this point. That being said, she is 13. You and your partner need to just be straight up honest with her about her feelings. How she feels about moving back in with her dad; living with you and your partner. Tell her that you want her to have love and stability and a place she can always call home. I can't see that the courts would give custody back with the previous relapses, but you will all still have to deal with the process. She is old enough to know what environment is healthier.  Ask her what she wants her life to look like in a few years. What does she need from you two, and what she wants out of life. Its okay for her to love her parents, and normal for her to want to live with them, but is it in her best interest of constant chaos? Kids need consistency and love, which you can provide.

Whenever something like that happens (medical emergency), we have a security team which has a medic on each shift to attend to person, and in the unfortunate case that someone passes, we have to wait for the medical examiner and the coroner arrives in order to pronounce T.O.D. and remove the body once they have completed their jobs. We have big yellow tarps on pvc pipe that you can roll out, to place around the area with the guest for privacy purposes. Well , when this gentleman passed at the black jack game, we obviously had to shut that particular table down.

JustNoSO,fdqqomx,t3_emntx3,1578672820.0,"Shut that shit down now! I wouldve grabbed his plate out from in front of him, took it to the front door and and whipped that bitch out like a frisbee. Then I wouldnt cook shit for him until he apologized. You are not a full service restaurant, so you get what you get and if you dont like it then you can make yourself a sandwich."
AskWomenOver30,fdqijex,t3_emn6hf,1578667527.0,"It sounds like you guys aren't really friends at all and just ""know"" each other casually. Why is her personal business so important to you and why do you care? So what if she has her own way of dealing with her own marriages? Maybe she doesn't want people all up in her shit. Like how does this affect you either way?"
relationship_advice,fdkjvj0,t1_fdkixyr,1578505182.0," Yeah, bc something that doesn't need any attention for four years is at the daily forefront of my mind...how dare I not remember when the card has been logged into my payment account for forever and when I make a purchase it just shows what card it is that is saved to my account. The ""sign"" is things like that are out of sight out of mind for me until I need to change something, and my first purchase happened to be my wedding dress."
relationship_advice,fdkiieb,t1_fdkhq3z,1578504508.0,"Oh but there are. Like actual things in real life like your debit card just expiring the day you go to order your wedding dress, things like that."
relationship_advice,fdkff7l,t1_fdketoh,1578502722.0,"We do work on things and talk, but I dont know if he would go talk to a therapist alone about his issues. He says I make him see things in a different way and I make him a better man. So I think he is a work in progress. I'm trying. I want to be a positive light for him."
relationship_advice,fdke0cx,t3_elulwc,1578501867.0,"I can't see that happening honestly. He will say its a waste of money. I think he would go to pre marital counseling, but not therapy for himself. Too much pride."
relationship_advice,fdkdqst,t1_fdkbxuj,1578501711.0,"No, but I dont think he would be opposed to it. Ive been married before. He has not. We have lived together for the last year and for the most part work well together on things. I dont know if we could get counseling within 3 weeks, but maybe I could go to the library or download something."
relationship_advice,fdkcz7t,t1_fdkc477,1578501258.0,"He used to be really bad and I have definitely seen him softening up bc I'm the opposite and shut it down, and his fam sees it too. I try to see the good and positives in everyone and basically just love everyone. He was bullied and has some anger issues about it. He needs to deal with some shit inside of him."
relationship_advice,fdkc0bn,t1_fdka17m,1578500675.0,"He can be quite abrasive at times, at or about anything and everything. Its negative energy. He says some pretty fucked up things about people and it just rubs me wrong. I put my foot down about things when I need to, but it's stressful to hear and deal with. But other times he is thoughtful and kind and caring and gets choked up about sweet things. That's one issue."
Marriage,fddsu0j,t1_fdd3auz,1578323091.0,I love this sooooomuch!!  Ending the day on a positive note ia so important!!
CPTSD,fd1sq3d,t1_fcza1so,1578136218.0,"I didnt even think about THAT correlation, bc of my mother!! I'm 40F and have dealt poker for the last 20 years (98% men), and bartended/waitressed in between and mostly men. I hate being around women most of the time. Like if they are cool and laid back and kind of ""tomboy"" or just more chill, I'm fine, but the ""karens"" that want to feel important and micromanage and demean and ""mean girl"" you, I shut down or get major anxiety."
Marriage,fczvrfl,t3_ejcagi,1578109442.0,"We do this all of the time lol! Just after Christmas, we had to take down the decos at work, and the tree in the back room was a bitch to take down, and I was later than usual coming home bc of the stupid tree. So I get home and I'm telling him about this whole process of what was all tangled up together on this tree and could NOT for the life of me think of the word ""ribbon"". I was like it had lights and birds and feathers, ornaments, some rubbery flowery sparkly thing and what's that other stuff??...hes like ""tinsel??"", I said ""no. It's like that, but not tinsel, ITS BOW TAPE!!"" Hes like I dont know what the hell..oh! RIBBON??!! I said yeah, and we cried laughing bc I could not think of the word ""ribbon"". So from now on, hes using ""bow tape"" for it. Duh. We were just laughing about it again lol. Dumb."

relationship_advice,fcss60d,t1_fcsrcgh,1577923750.0,You don't have to say shit. Just show her the entire thread. How things go from there are completely up to her.
JUSTNOMIL,fca6di7,t3_egp0u9,1577563716.0,"I'm in iowa right off of I 80, if you need food or a hotel room with a shower. I have connections here. The weather is not going to be good, so please stop when you need to. If you need gas I can get you a gas card or a universal prepaid visa card to use. Stay strong!! You are a bad ass!! I had to do the same thing about 18 years ago, hide and move across country with my baby about 2000 miles after he almost drowned her. It was terrifying and was paranoid for a long time. He did find me and luckily I worked in a casino and they banned him and I had big male friends at work that would stay on my couch for a while after. You can do this!! I'm here to help any way I can!"
CPTSD,fc7atm6,t3_egk21y,1577502114.0,"Same exact thing. It's like somewhere along the way, I decided I had to fight for myself bc no one else would fight for me and then id go off if I felt criticized or down talked to like I was lesser of a person than they were. I'm very very intuitive to peoples intentions (probably always having to be on guard all of the time, having to walk on eggshells constantly so I wouldn't ""mess up""), and I get triggered and pissy around entitled people."
ptsd,fc790dh,t3_egj3ls,1577500715.0,"I have had nightmares and night sweats for a few years now. I hit an indica dominant thc pen before bed and watch a blue planet episode (marine life). I still have them, but definitely not as intense or as many. I really want to do some really deep intense therapy to get all of it out of my head. Lately it just sits there and my brain chatter and senses are amplified, so I've been hitting my pen more often. It's not a solution really, just helps to alleviate sometimes."
JUSTNOMIL,fc5d6bm,t3_eg9j5f,1577453957.0,"Have all of this done before the next time you see her. You need to have everything having to do with your business only on you. You are an adult, there are hundreds of ways to have your personal matters taken care of when you are abroad without needing anyone else. You can have her solely as your medical poa, but anything having to with your business, HELL NO. This needs to be a sit down conversation with both of your parents when you go back. BOUNDARIES!!!! You need to tell them that YOU alone have worked on your business, and there is absolutely no reason to have family involved. If the work becomes too much, you will hire professionals to handle your affairs. It is your business, and you are making an executive business decision that family will not be involved bc it always becomes messy and causes rifts.  You want to keep the relationship healthy and have a successful business. Period. PUT YOUR FOOT DOWN!! Do NOT feel guilty about establishing boundaries. If they don't like it, that is not on you."
JUSTNOMIL,fc2yhqb,t3_efr9je,1577377364.0,"Thats so great you all got to reconnect!! I'm sure his heart was so filled with love with everyone!! As you and your sister will never get that time back that your mom stole from you in having a relationship with him, you can have a relationship now! Call him when he gets home and tell him exactly how much Christmas meant this year, and that you want it to continue. Does he just not like leaving Texas or is it financial or physical barriers? Maybe you and your kids could face time him once a week on a set time. Like Sundays at 5 pm or something. Maybe start saving up right now to but him a plane ticket for the summer to come stay. Good luck!"
