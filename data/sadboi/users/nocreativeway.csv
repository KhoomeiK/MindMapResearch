I talked with my doctor 4 days ago about tapering and I’m just having the worst time trying and beating myself up. I know it’s only been 4 days and my sponsor has also said that this drug is just really hard to get off. I’m thinking of doing a medical detox and just being done with it. I can’t live being dependent on a drug anymore. I’ll continue to try to taper this month but if I can’t manage to get down a dose by the end of the end of this monthly script then I want to surrender to detox. That feeling of running out and hands shaking, trembling, waves of intense anxiety is the worst. This is much harder than alcohol. Thank you for your response."

I have been getting headaches once a week since I quit drinking. Idk if it’s not eating enough, not enough sugar, too much caffeine, not drinking enough water.

My dad is a severe alcoholic dying of cirrosis and he needed my help this week but he didn’t even thank me for helping him. It’s literally just a whole bunch of shit at once.
