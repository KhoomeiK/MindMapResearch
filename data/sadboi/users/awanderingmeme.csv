Endo,fr32rb0,t1_fr2d1eo,1589848772.0,I mentioned I lost a lot of weight from not being able to eat and pain during intercourse and after like a billion tests they finally did a laparoscopy. Usually if you just keep stressing the pain they should consider a laparoscopy. I also mentioned blood in my stool so I had to go through even more tests
Paranormal,fr13tu5,t1_fr03dy3,1589812721.0,"Thank you!!! I regularly go to a therapist but I haven‚Äôt brought these experiences up with her yet mostly because I feel stupid even saying it out loud? Like hello I think something spooky is screwing with me?? Idk hence why I came to reddit to post, otherwise I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll get thrown in a padded room. I‚Äôm hoping when I leave this apartment and move in with my bf things will feel less intense and I can focus all my energy on happiness there. ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
Paranormal,fqzp6ev,t1_fqw4ruk,1589772213.0,Sometimes when I‚Äôm getting up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom or get some water I get chills. Usually I sprint back to my bed like a little kid and just try and fall asleep

Paranormal,fqzoyfz,t1_fqwsgm8,1589772066.0,"Honestly the amount of stress in my life has always been at high lol. What wigs me out is that I only talk in my sleep when I sleep at my boyfriends place. When I‚Äôm at my apartment by myself I just have an eery feeling. I‚Äôm hoping maybe it‚Äôs just the energy of this place (don‚Äôt like the office staff, downstairs neighbors are a nightmare, etc.) and when we move to our new place these experiences will be something to laugh about."
Paranormal,fqzoptj,t1_fqwyn2h,1589771908.0,"My boyfriend is not very religious and doesn‚Äôt really believe in the paranormal. He did admit that on those two occasions he had like chills down his spine. I have holy water and crosses throughout my apartment and I sleep with my rosary now but I still feel like something is watching me at times. I will try the sage, we are moving in together in a few weeks and I am definitely going to stick crystals and sage for our new home."

Paranormal,fqlr4rn,t3_gjhtrc,1589464475.0,"This is literally the plot of every paranormal movie, don‚Äôt be the main character that gets possessed. Unless you want to be haunted or even worse I‚Äôd suggest staying as far away from there as possible. Those ‚Äúimages‚Äù your friend is seeing could be a malevolent trick to get you back there by whatever growled at you."

endometriosis,fpk32ud,t1_fpja78e,1588686996.0,I started wearing normal clothing when I returned to work but by doing that and also moving around too soon that caused my incision site to bleed. My jeans were too tight and pressed on the incision site which resulted in bleeding. It‚Äôs been a year since my laparoscopy but I suggest wearing dresses/leggings if you have to go out until your incision site is fully healed.
endometriosis,fpk2ng3,t1_fpj67am,1588686748.0,"I had my first laparoscopy last year, I also have a retroverted uterus so bowel movements/sex are painful x2. But lately I‚Äôve noticed a lot of blood in my stool and combining that with this never ending period I‚Äôm thinking about going to have another surgery done. I highly suggest finding an endometriosis specialist! I originally went to a OBGYN for diagnosis but since I moved I‚Äôm searching for a specialist near me for more targeted care."
endometriosis,fpiud4q,t3_gdoupu,1588648917.0,"I usually get chest pains but the general area is under my left breast. Not deep because I can actually press on the spot and target where it hurts. I sum it up to me being on extra hormones due to being on my period for over a month. I‚Äôve had breast ultrasounds and they came clear, doctor agreed it could be due to the extra hormones. Also noted that caffeine causes similar pain as well"
endometriosis,fpitwt7,t1_fpitr74,1588648626.0,You know I haven‚Äôt thought about it but that happens to me too! Usually I drink coffee when I‚Äôm on. Cleaning spree so I blame that but the more physical movement Indo the longer the flare up lasts
endometriosis,fpipvok,t3_gd3158,1588646087.0,Yes!!! During severe flare ups I usually lay on the floor in the fetal position. If I lay flat down it actually makes the pin worse so I have to lay sideways. I found that I usually have terrible flare ups if I drink a lot of caffeine so I try to drink coffee rarely. I also stopped taking Midol since it has a lot of caffeine in it. Usually my whole lower body is just throbbing during bad flare ups so I try to sleep until it‚Äôs bearable.
endometriosis,fpiphgz,t3_gd00vg,1588645842.0,"Chick-fil-a, I‚Äôm vegan but for some reason when a flare up happens I crave chicken lmao"
endometriosis,fpipf7h,t3_gd86ip,1588645802.0,"I highly suggest investing in some loose fitting pants/shorts! You don‚Äôt want anything that will press against your incision and irritate it. I was in so much pain after my surgery I needed to use a chair to take a shower, if it‚Äôs possible it may be best to have someone in the vicinity in case you fall. Don‚Äôt push yourself too much, my worst mistake was trying to rush the healing process. I ended up causing my incision site to bleed. Sitting around you will get bored out of your mind, might be best to plan ahead and make sure you have plenty to keep you busy. Last thing is remember that surgery takes a toll on the body and you will be bloated for a while afterwards. Don‚Äôt stress about that, focus on letting your body heal."
endometriosis,fpijdbf,t3_gclo6i,1588642124.0,"I have a retroverted uterus which cause some pain during sex in certain positions, as long as you take a note mentally of what works for you it‚Äôs best to ignore what causes pain (unless you‚Äôre into that sort of thing?)"
Delightfullychubby,fpdwhme,t1_fpdrunq,1588535630.0,"She has a younger sister named Hibiki which has made her much more friendly/calm. She still has moments where she will get upset if there‚Äôs a loud noise (sister knocking stuff off the counter, loud neighbors, etc.) but  it hasn‚Äôt helped with her belly. Hopefully the vet will have some options for her"
Delightfullychubby,fpd4kuh,t1_fpd416f,1588519704.0,Lmao yes the struggle! We go to the vet every couple of months since we‚Äôve been working on dropping her weight. I will definitely bring this up in our next appointment!!
Delightfullychubby,fpd4e8q,t1_fpd0u2z,1588519595.0,Thank you so much for this!!! We go to the vet every couple of months since she weighed over 20lbs when I adopted her.

Delightfullychubby,fpd0x0b,t1_fpchpli,1588517443.0,Have you seen this before? Since I adopted her I have been trying to determine why it isn‚Äôt growing back. She was abused in her last home so she does have some anxiety issues
Chonkers,fpc3nic,t1_fpbtixg,1588486550.0,I adopted her a year ago and her belly didn‚Äôt have any hair. At our weight/vaccination checkup appointment next month I am going to bring it up with our vet for diagnosis.
