She‚Äôs going to law school to build a better life for you as a family as a whole and to better herself.. as a husband you should be supporting her and encouraging her and being her biggest supporter not complaining to your parents about it!

AirBnB,fjnjx0z,t1_fjn9pxk,1583508978.0,Yeah she didn‚Äôt actually leave me a review personally - I guess because she genuinely had nothing bad to say and only lashed out once she‚Äôd seen the bad review I left her

AirBnB,fjmwnem,t1_fjmwjo6,1583487694.0,Exactly! And I have absolutely categorically been nothing but polite and kind and understanding - it‚Äôs so upsetting that the host is basically lashed out at my review and just made up all sorts!
relationship_advice,fjkfh8n,t3_fdxjqz,1583425918.0,"I think he‚Äôs just freaking out internally about being a father and he‚Äôs not coping well with it.

Set a nice mood one evening, soft lighting, candles, whatever, make a cup of something warm for the both of you and just talk to him

Tell him youre worried about this pregnancy, about him stepping up, tell him you understand that maybe he‚Äôs anxious about it but also explain that the baby is both of yours and you want to be a team and do things together 

Explain that just because he‚Äôs going to be a father doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs going to lose his youth or not be able to have fun but what he‚Äôs doing at the moment is upsetting you 

Organise date nights, go out and do fun things together, have your friends come over and just rebuild your relationship and work on strengthening it and getting closer

Don‚Äôt break things off right away, give him a chance to open up to you too and then give him some time to change / prove that he‚Äôll be a good father

Communication is key 

Hope it all works out for you"

Also do you think he would have told you he washed your socks if he thought for 2 seconds there was a risk of them being someone else‚Äôs? 

You can‚Äôt find anything in his phone too, and he‚Äôs sticking to his story

I‚Äôve ended up with all sorts of items from the laundrette... and I put my socks together when I wash them so they come out as a pair - maybe that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happened 

They might also be an ex‚Äôs pair of socks that ended up in his laundry - you‚Äôve only been together a couple months so it‚Äôs really not that unlikely 

You‚Äôve jumped from 0 to 100 real quick to be honest 

I‚Äôd talk to him properly, and also have an adult conversation more generally about cheating"
relationship_advice,fjjgiy0,t3_fdrvdy,1583395031.0,"Ask yourself - if you stayed with him would you trust that he wouldn‚Äôt do it again?

 Would you constantly be thinking what‚Äôs he doing in the next room? 

Would you be thinking ‚ÄòI wonder if he‚Äôs talking to other girls‚Äô? 

Do you want a relationship where you either monitor your BF‚Äôs internet history/ snoop through his phone? 

Would you be able to forgive AND forget and move on?

If you answer no to any of them, then I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs never going to be a healthy happy relationship because the trust will be gone, and one of the foundations of a relationship is trust"

Otherwise contact Airbnb and ask their opinion"
