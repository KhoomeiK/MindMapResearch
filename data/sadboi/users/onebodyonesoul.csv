I didn’t take adderall for a week and penis still shrinked, so definetly that’s not it, I also took adderall and I could get hard while on it. I sense a lower libido overall not like a lot but some I’m in my mid 20s"

I CAN'T STAND SWEDEN AND FINLAND. I shouldn’t say that about the 2nd because I’ve never been, but I’ve got to meet finish people, and they’re the most uninteresting people on earth, racist and overall just lame.

The Swedish are straight racist, waaay to racist they think they’re the jewel of Europe when they’re not, Norwegians don’t like Swedes hahaha I thought it was me, but I even had classmates exchange students from Sweden, and they were so pretentious won't talk to anyone but people from their circle

Iceland, Norway, Denmark are absolutely heaven on earth, I believe Denmark is marked as the worlds happiest country I thought it was silly, but when I went everyone smiling giving me directions asking me if i was okay and I was up for some drinks later on, OF COURSE, they weren’t doing all the work i would ask do you know about cool bars tonight to meet people and get to know y'all cultures and then they will take me.

At a bar, I met the dean of the University of Copenhague and gave me full instructions on how to apply to be an exchange student, scholarships, basically how to land financial aid.

Others also have me give them my number because these two guys and girl were gonna be free next day and were down to go with me to to this museum to see an exhibit of Yayoi which is one of the reasons I went to the city.

I've always told myself I most likely be retiring there lol I forgot to say that i asked some of them if they mind the Syrian refugees and they told me that they don’t mind anyone as long as they’ve a job and do something for a living, you can tell their culture is about thriving not about judging.
