They got one of my old passwords (from the early 2000s) and tried to use that against me. The funny thing is that I don't even have a webcam. They're just looking to scare people. I've heard that if you do give in and pay them, they'll keep harassing you."

questions,fm7y6zr,t3_ftjn4n,1585839151.0,"I've found that working out can help my insomnia. It can still be a challenge for me to go to sleep sometimes, but if I can wear myself out just enough, it usually makes staying asleep easier. 

Instead of insomnia medications , I've also used CBD oil before bed. I think it can help to calm you down. It might be worth a shot if you are able to access/use it. 

Setting a regular bedtime/wakeup time is important and then setting some time aside to unwind without electronics can help. Like reading a book or sketching before going to sleep."
Marriage,fm1gbb0,t1_fm19s7u,1585677891.0,"I agree with you completely in that some people just want others to be miserable. Several years ago, when  my husband and I were married for about 5 years already, his grandfather was dying in the hospital. I sat and held my husband's hand while we were in the waiting room and his aunt very snidely asked us if we were still in ""the honeymoon stage"" then when I grabbed a chair for him when it was time to sit in his grandfather's room, she told me that ""chivalry was dead"". Couldn't believe it at the time as it felt like an attack but she's in a miserable unhappy marriage and probably couldn't stand to see us happy and in love."

I feel more energetic and productive throughout the day since I don't have to wake up at 6 in the morning to work from home. I have everything I need right here.

ChoosingBeggars,fjsguhy,t1_fjqx39m,1583596827.0,"I agree. I think when I was starting out, I desperately wanted practice and my friends who aren't financially fortunate were more than happy to take advantage of that. It kind of became a habit for me and something they would come to expect. Moving forward, I have to remember not to be such a pushover."
ChoosingBeggars,fjhzpc2,t1_fjhcrru,1583358039.0,That's a very good way of looking at it.
ChoosingBeggars,fjhzmjb,t1_fjhu9wn,1583357998.0,I'm sorry that happened to you. That just sounds so horrible and selfish. There were a couple of occasions that occurred when I was young and starting out when my friends would offer that I could either be a bridesmaid or a free photographer. I've done wedding invitations for free and I've done engagement shoots and save the date cards which were never even used. It's no fun.  I'm shy and non-confrontational by nature and a people pleaser. It's taken me a long time to learn to say no and it's not always easy.

ChoosingBeggars,fjgn0pa,t1_fjg39lt,1583330997.0,"Well, they did ask for free wedding photography in the first place and I did offer something a bit different. I think what got me was that they asked me to travel an hour away to a location that's not super easy to get to for a free (very short) photo shoot. That's basically a 2-hour round trip instead of agreeing to meet somewhere closeby. Maybe not the worst thing, but I felt it was like giving them an inch and them taking a mile."
ChoosingBeggars,fjgmpqx,t1_fjgi1em,1583330781.0,"Yes, this exactly. Plus it's a difficult location to get to."
ChoosingBeggars,fjgmn98,t1_fjg1yad,1583330733.0,That's the truth! I can't even begin to tell you how many times I've been taken advantage when I was younger and just starting out =/ no more.
AskReddit,fh9vfb9,t3_f1qr07,1581390518.0,"It usually takes me from 2-4 hours to fall asleep. For me, it's almost like the feeling of adrenaline. I'll lie awake with anxiety even after a calm and uneventful day. It's like a subtle panic. Also, heat or warmth. I have to have a cold room and cool blanket to fall asleep, then there's finding the perfect position to sleep in. I thrash quite a bit. When I do fall asleep, I'm sensitive to even the faintest noise, like the sound of a light switch being flipped will be enough to wake me. So it must be absolutely silent and dark."

AskReddit,ffk621f,t3_ett7fr,1580017051.0,"When I was 12, my parents divorced because my father was caught taking money from my college fund that my Grandfather gave to me to invest in shoddy stocks. He lost $20k and when their divorce happened, he took the remaining amount to buy a house for himself. I only saw $60 of the money when I was living in a subsidized housing situation at 18 and I needed money for my electric bill during winter. My biggest mistake until this point was listening to my teachers, principals, parents, grandparents, aunts & uncles telling me that I needed a college degree no matter what. They convinced little 19 yr old me that college was worth it and that the student loan payments would be more than manageable. So I took out the loans and got my BFA in graphic design ""you can get a degree in basket-weaving and still find a good job!"" I can't regret it more. I'm so fucked and so scared that I won't be able to retire. That's my biggest mistake (so far)."
Anxiety,fc0lugp,t3_efhvg8,1577294059.0,"Absolutely. I managed to make it through college, but during my last couple of semesters, my anxiety and depression were so serious that I spent most of my time battling suicidal thoughts. Now, 5 years later, I feel like a complete failure. I make less than I did right after school. I feel like I'd do better in job interviews if I didn't have anxiety. I wouldn't hear potential employers say ""you seem quiet"" or ""you seem shy"" before passing me up for someone else. I have no social life because of my anxiety. It makes me lose my chance to truly be myself and shine. I often fear the future because I don't know what to do and my anxiety is always there, holding me back."
depression,fbzjhkh,t3_ef4960,1577248780.0,"I'm feeling the same way today. I've never been a huge Christmas person but in the past, I've made a point to make it a nice holiday for my spouse with gifts and decorations and special beers and movies. This year? I honestly just wanted to skip. I was so grateful that the roads were icy the night of my company Christmas party so I couldn't make it. My SO did all of the work of putting up the tree tonight and I had to buy my own gift so my SO could wrap something as he was actually getting upset that I didn't want any gifts this year.  Now, I'm trying to get through the evening but I'm tired and I want to go to sleep. There's a part of me that doesn't want to see 2020 too.

I hope your holidays go well. Sometimes it helps to take a step back and cancel plans if you feel too mentally drained."
