I definitely have the same issue where sometimes I take 2 bites of something small and feel that pressure, so I always thought I was feeling something else and not really feeling the sensation of fullness. I’ve had this issue my entire life and I’m not sure what the deal is! It’s very frustrating! Even at my thinnest, when I was a healthy weight, I couldn’t feel “full” so I was just heavily restricting to like 800 cals per day because I couldn’t rely on the whole “eat until you’re full” advice :("

I obviously understand the difference between having a “hungry” mental state and being physically hungry, but I’m just wondering if you guys also have the problem of never feeling full after eating? I can genuinely say that, no matter how much I eat, I still don’t know what being full feels like! Is this normal?"

Sonographers,fqen6e0,t3_giaxq9,1589310336.0,"Kim and Erran G on YouTube really helped me learn about travel sonography. Usually you take assignments through agencies and if you want your stipends and money to be nontaxable, which is a big part of why travelers make so much, you have to be a “non-commutable distance from your tax home” so being in the same area wouldn’t necessarily work. There is no specific radius that is needed, it just has to be completely unrealistic to expect you to commute from your tax home to where your assignment is."

Sonographers,fplc64e,t1_fplbhdc,1588710094.0,"Also just a note: I am going into this career because it’s something I’m extremely interested in, very passionate about, and because it is lucrative. However, I am also going into this field knowing that I will certainly need some kind of nest egg saved up ASAP because I am fully expecting to be injured and unable to work at some point in my career. For me it is worth it because I care a lot about the field and, since I plan to travel, I will likely be making $80,000-$100,000 a year. In my opinion, eventually needing time off for an injury is just a necessary evil and trade off for all the good things about this career."

Proper ergonomics are important and help, but at some point I think pretty much everyone will deal with injuries or pain unless they just don’t end up staying in the field very long."

No one deserves to be in that much pain, dealing with so much stress, or facing so many things like this at once. I really hope you don’t lose your job, that’s the last thing you would need on top of all of this. And my heart breaks for your grandpa... I don’t even know what to say other than “I’m sorry” because I’ve been there and no words really ease the pain of a lost loved one. I understand what you mean about the stomach thing too... I’ve had issues ever since the environmental stress of the virus has come up, and I am still dealing with it. I just hope you get some kind of relief soon.

The pain feels much worse but when I talked to a family member about it I got the typical “maybe it’s just in your head since you’re so stressed out” thing and it made me wonder if they were right and if I was crazy/opting into all of this extra pain for no reason"

Thank you for your response. I genuinely feel like it’s much worse now... the pain now causes me to cry at night and my Fitbit is giving me warnings for not getting enough sleep but I can’t get comfortable enough to fall asleep because my joints are just killing me. It was such a drastic/sudden change that I started to wonder if I was imagining it or just pitying myself because of the situation... I wasn’t sure if there was like specific evidence or other stories of stress causing huge spikes in pain but I swear I felt it!!!"
AskReddit,fnix8ub,t3_g1u0ex,1586987985.0,"I worked in an Americanized Chinese restaurant as my first job ever. I got hired when I turned 15 to be a busser, and I was the only American working there. All the other employees were spoke Mandarin and sometimes struggled to talk to the American customers; kind of a notable thing since I live in a redneck part of Ohio. 

Anyway. They would occasionally leave their tables to go take a break or eat a meal. I would get very annoyed because all the servers did it at the same time, which meant I was one busser who would end up waiting on the whole entire restaurant alone. It was my first job so I did NOT handle that stress well and ad a kid I would get so aggravated with them. This was particularly a problem because if people wanted to put an order in while the servers were on break, I couldn’t help them since I didn’t know how to write or communicate the order in Mandarin, and that’s the only language the kitchen staff spoke. 

I remember one day, this customer made his waitress cry. Not sure what he said to her but she decided to go take her break to compose herself, and all the other servers went to console her. I was left to wait on him alone and I was terrified. He basically chewed me up and spit me out because I couldn’t put in orders for him like he wanted, and his waitress was too scared of him/not ready to come back out yet. I had to try to remember his orders, run back to the kitchen, tell his waitress, have her write it in Mandarin for the chefs, and then take the food back out to him when it was ready. When he was done eating he wouldn’t sign his credit card receipt for the bill, then left a bunch of pennies on the table as his tip. I was actually pleasantly surprised he left any tip at all based on the way he had been acting... except then I noticed that the pennies were arranged to spell out the word “CH*NK”. 

I realize now, as an adult, that the reason those women took their breaks like that was because they all worked every single day of the week from open to close. The meals they had with each other replaced the meals they were missing with their families, and it was one of the very few times all day long that they got to sit down and rest from their physically demanding jobs. All that work, just to be treated as though they were worthless by ignorant strangers."
