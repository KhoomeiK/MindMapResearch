BeautyGuruChatter,f5zb20i,t3_dpt2wu,1572572022.0,I saw someone review this and they said for the glitter it works better to get the shadow on the brush then spray Mac fix+ on the brush
Anxiety,ez4db1o,t1_ez2anmp,1567685046.0,Thank you for sharing this! It makes sense. It’s interesting how the body and mind work.
Anxiety,ez1kjet,t1_ez1d1af,1567648564.0,That’s what I’m starting to think is my issue. I play a lot of softball and it usually takes me about an hour after the game ends to feel “normal”

Anxiety,eyjwbx1,t3_cx9kkt,1567130009.0,"My anxiety is always bad at night. The only thing that seems to maintain it is having a strict bedtime routine. So I get ready for bed at the same time, read for the same amount of time every night, drink a cup of sleepytime tea, and shut the lights out at the same time every night. Sometimes it’s works, but sometimes it doesn’t. But it’s gotten easier now that I have the routine"
Anxietyhelp,exvbsxr,t3_cujdsm,1566596444.0,I’ve taken amoxicillin many times throughout my life. I’ve never had any issues and it’s perfectly safe to take in that dosage! Just make sure you finish the medicine even if you start to feel better.
Anxiety,expazwz,t3_cty90i,1566488207.0,"Every time I get a panic attack, I’m convinced it’s a heart attack. I get the tingly arms, my heart is racing, I start to sweat. 

I completely understand what you experienced and it’s so scary! I’ve had a few while driving and I just have to pull over and wait for the feeling to pass."
Anxiety,exkypwq,t1_exkyex6,1566402183.0,"Do you get a yearly physical with a general practitioner? If you have insurance, I would highly recommend getting one and ask for a full blood panel. If you don’t have insurance, then I’d look to see if there are any free clinics in your area! 

I understand the worry though. I always think I’m going to have a heart attack or stroke when I am experiencing high levels of anxiety."
Anxiety,exkwxon,t3_cthn79,1566400919.0,"Did the doctor do any blood tests? A full panel blood test would be an easy way to address your concerns. Your white blood cell count can identify if there is any “infection” that your body may be trying to fight. 

Although rare, brain tumors happen but depending on the tumor and location, you would probably be experiencing more symptoms. 

I constantly worry about my health, but that’s also how my anxiety flares up. Every year I get my physical and everything comes back perfect on blood work/xrays/scans. Don’t be afraid to talk to a trusted medical professional."
Anxiety,exkw78p,t3_cti5c0,1566400385.0,"You’re not alone, friend. I feel the exact same way"
Anxiety,ewpllfm,t1_ewp8s8a,1565643825.0,This is literally me
Sims4,ewkqxmj,t3_cooil8,1565491980.0,This just happened to me about 20 minutes ago 😂😂 I wasn’t quick enough to grab a screenshot so this is awesome
Anxiety,ewkpthz,t1_ewkpm3d,1565491088.0,Thank you! I will have to find a good show/movie to watch while on the plane. I’d prefer to not use any more medication like benzos because I won’t have time to go to the doctor and discuss everything before I leave. But I really appreciate the advice!
