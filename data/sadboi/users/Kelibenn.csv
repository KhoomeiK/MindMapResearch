I really try to stay out of the argument when it comes to cultural appropriation, but I don’t understand why everything has to put into a box. If something is no longer considered stigmatized why can’t we celebrate that and move on? I will say that I do not agree with white people being able to get away with one thing while a minority group is still being criticized for said thing. But holy fuck it is hoop earrings and bondage. Can we please move on?"
TumblrInAction,fpg9r9d,t3_gdbbe8,1588598007.0,"Sorry for format as I am on mobile. To an extent, I do understand this. Hoops have had a stigma surrounding them for quite a bit of time, and haven’t been acceptable by the masses until recently. In fact, I still get comments whenever I wear hoops to this day. I believe the stigma behind hoops is stemmed from whorephobia rather than racism. I may be wrong, and if I am please feel free to educate me on this."

Probably one of the most scarring things I have ever had to watch. I’ll never forget it. Rest In peace to all of the victims."

I also am only attracted to people that I strongly admire. It’s almost as if I have to look up to my partner. Lastly, I struggle when things become mundane. I want the honeymoon phase all of the time."
