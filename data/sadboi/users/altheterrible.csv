ChronicPain,fooy9dw,t3_g7bo3m,1587949018.0,"Coming from a pharmacist, it's going to be difficult to find a pharmacist that would fill pain meds for an unknown patient. Part of it is company policy, which is where going to an independent can help you. But ultimately the decision is up to the pharmacist. Some pharmacists are assholes and enjoy judging people and making them suffer. Some (many) are cowards who have never experienced needing a scheduled (controlled medications,; narcotics) medication and don't understand how pain management works. I

f you came to me, unknown, with narcotic prescriptions and nothing else, the first thing I would do is make sure the prescriptions don't have any signs of being fakes. Not because I think you personally are a drug addict, this is something I do with every prescription. Then I would look you up in thre state database that tracks narcotic prescriptions. I'd be looking at your history to see if you have a habit of refilling early. I'd want to see if you use multiple pharmacies and doctors, as this is a sign of doctor shopping. When I was done with the state database, if I still has concerns, i would call your doctor to verify the prescriptions.

At that point, if everything looked legit, there are a ton of pharmacists who still wouldn't fill the prescription. This it's because they teach us in pharmacy school that opioids are the enemy and we have a duty to help stop the opioid epidemic. Conversely, at that point I would 100% feel fine about filing those prescriptions, if I hadn't already made that decision at an earlier step. This is because I have dealt with my struggles obtaining needed medications and I know how devastating it can be. 

I just wanted to give some insight into what pharmacists are doing and thinking when you give them a narcotic prescription. There are many pharmacists who are judgmental and want to make you suffer because they think you're an evil drug addict. You are not imagining this, I have worker with pharmacists like that many times. All I can say is that if you find the right pharmacist, they can be an incredible resource. 

I hope you find the pharmacy that offers what you need!"

ChronicPain,fne2mjy,t3_g0q1qx,1586881968.0,"Hi, pharmacist here.

I do not have a problem with patients who take any schedule 2 drug (most opioids and ADHD meds). I really am not that invested in your medication. I mean, I care that it's safe and effective, but that's it.  

I do, however, have a huge problem with the DEA. They monitor our filling habits very closely and if they decide I'm filling ""too many"" narcotics prescriptions they'll launch an investigation. The DEA thinks it's my job to limit opioid prescriptions, whereas I see my job as providing safe and effective drug therapy. 

Another problem with the DEA is that they limit our purchasing of opioids to a certain limit, and if we reach that limit we get off until the next month. This is why if a new patient walks in with a prescription for 180 Norco 7.5s, I might decline to fill it. It had nothing to do with judgment but rather making sure my regulars are able to get their medications. 

Sometimes I'll get a prescription for an opioid that I don't feel is safe. In that case, I check the patient's past opioid use in their profile and in the state's prescription drug monitoring database to see if the prescription is consistent with others the patient has received. If I still have a question, I'll call the prescriber. Only if they can't justify the dosing will I even consider refusing to fill the prescription. 

We also track physician prescribing practices, and if a doctor consistently writes suspicious prescriptions, we may decide to stop accepting his prescriptions. Again, this isn't a reflection on you. 

Some pharmacists are judgmental assholes. I've worked under them. They are absolutely in the wrong to deny a patient treatment because they have a moral hangup over some classes of drugs. 

I'd like to offer some insight into the things that might make your prescription seem suspicious. First, if you've never had an opioid prescription before and one day you show up with a prescription for a large number of very strong pills. There are legitimate reasons this situation can occur, but its going to raise red flags. 

Two, if you have a history of early refills, a pharmacist may believe that you're abusing your meds. When I was in grad school, I was seeing the campus psychiatrist every 28 days. Afterwards, I would go to the pharmacy to refill my various psych meds, including my ADHD medication. Once day, there was a new pharmacist there who refused to fill the stimulant because ""you're always refilling early why don't you have any left, you must be taking more than you're supposed to."" What an asshole. A history of early refills is not enough to decide someone is misusing their meds, but bad pharmacists do it all the time. 

Three, you refill controlled substances at many different pharmacies. These days, all controlled substance prescriptions are monitored, and we regularly check your history before we fill a prescription. Filling at many pharmacies makes it look like you're trying to hide your prescriptions. You're probably just shopping around for the best deal, but it's a red flag.

Four, you call the pharmacy multiple times to see if your opioid medication is ready. You're in pain and you want it to stop ASAP. The pharmacy doesn't see it that way, though, they see you add an obnoxious drug addict desperate for their next fix. 

Sorry this is so long. TL;DR some pharmacists are definitely judgmental assholes, but there are other reasons they'd decline to fill an opioid prescription. If you ever have any questions about pharmacy practice, procedures, or regulations, or medication questions, please feel free to DM me."

depressionregimens,fm1swdn,t1_fm1hn7o,1585684415.0,"I think therapy is a big part of it, specifically cbt that challenges irrational thought patterns. Depression makes you feel helpless and incapable of doing anything to improve the situation, and usually that's not true. I've been lucky enough to have really good therapy. Good therapy helps you see your own bullshit. Once you're aware of your own bullshit, you can start fixing it.

I'm a pharmacist, I'm a big fan of drugs, but I think people expect too much from them. For me, Effexor brought me from black suicidal despair to gray nothing. I wasn't cured and that frustrated me for a long time. But it gave me enough of a chance that I could do the therapy that ultimately led to remission."
depressionregimens,flxcl7a,t3_frnpei,1585580194.0,"Yeah, they can help. But more and more I'm convinced that medication is only about 1/10 of the picture when it comes to recovering from mental illness."
depressionregimens,flw0kxc,t3_frcm5f,1585536597.0,Any drug will have side effects. If there's no side effects than it's probably not doing anything. SJW isn't a great antidepressant and it can actually increase anxiety.

diabetes,flc310p,t1_flag8qt,1585018629.0,"1. Call a pharmacy close to where you usually get your insulin. Ask if they have Humalog.
2. If they say yes, tell them you want to transfer your prescription there. They will ask where you usually fill. 
3. New pharmacy will call old pharmacy for you. 
4. New pharmacy fills prescription. 

If the first pharmacy you try doesn't have humalog, try another. But a lot of pharmacies don't keep humalog in stock. 

A prescription can be transferred and filled in ten minutes if everyone has their shit together."

Yesterday, my barely trained, still mostly incompetent self had to work alone for 8 hours because one tech was sick, the other was out of town, and the pharmacy manager had picked up a shift at a different store. So yeah, I didn't even get the front end employee to help because they're just as understaffed as we are. Nothing can close a big chain pharmacy."
depressionregimens,fkpexlw,t1_fkorr9b,1584408486.0,"These drugs have serious long and short term side effects, way worse than SSRIs/SNRIs. Any doctor treating mild depression with an antipsychotic is a quack."
depressionregimens,fkpepzn,t3_fjr64y,1584408342.0,"I'm a pharmacist and I'm freaked out by how common antipsychotic use is becoming. I had a patient a few weeks ago with no significant mental health history who was having some mild depression due to being cooped up after a surgery. His doctor prescribed paliperidone as first line monotherapy. Not only is an antipsychotic not the first choice for mild depression, that particular antipsychotic wouldn't be my first choice for anything. 

I took an antipsychotic for two years, decided in December it just was too risky."

GetMotivated,fhixre2,t3_f3g9dp,1581633968.0,"I started pharmacy school at age 28, when most of my classmates were 20-22. I spent my 20s living in poverty and severely  mentally ill, bouncing from one psych hospital to another. At 25, I decided to give college a try to give myself structure (and excess student aid money). Then I ended up in pharmacy school at a university with excellent student mental healthcare. I was in therapy for the whole four years. Today I am 33 and I have my doctorate, I'm over one year free from self harm and hospitalizations, and I'm making over 100k a year. So yeah, it's never too late to accomplish your goals and live your dreams."

Even in a hospital setting there isn't much patient interaction. In a retail setting, my patient interaction mostly consists of ringing them up at the register.

There is no prestige. I have a doctorate but no one cares. My name tag still just has my first name on it. It would be ridiculous to expect my patients to call me Dr. Altheterrible, let alone colleagues. I'm literally cringing thinking about it.

Do something else."

If your psych wants you on 2 antipsychotics to control psychosis, maybe suggest switching the Invega to a first generation antipsychotic?

mentalillness,fdzy424,t3_enhrn4,1578798643.0,"Wellbutrin isn't generally a good choice for anxiety. It isn't FDA approved for that indication. Anxiety tends to respond better to serotonergic drugs, and Wellbutrin doesn't affect serotonin at all.
