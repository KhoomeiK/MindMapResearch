My grandfather was a Nam vet and a cop. Catholic too. And yet, he had the balls to cheat on his wife, impregnate his mistress and leave his first family for his new family, leaving an emotional and mental scar on my Mom, his eldest daughter's psyche forever. That was a factor as she went insane, with my Dad divorcing her. She's with my grandmother now. But, what you did wasn't  even remotely right. My Dad did all he could to keep the marriage going, but nothing worked. So, he had no other choice but to leave. But he sure didn't cheat on her or smack her. 

Let me put this in a language you can hopefully understand in that dumb brain of yours.   


How about: you call your wife and apologize to her like an actual  man and take responsibility for your actions, you inhuman slime. I'd also get tested too. Idiot. What kind of a man smacks his own  wife? So, what if she's manipulative? Doesn't mean you smack her face like a pimp. You should've been a lot nicer to her! Maybe, she wouldn't have nagged so much. Maybe if you were nice enough, and she still actually was a nag like you said she was: you'd collect some evidence that roasts her in court, show it to the judge along with trustworthy witnesses telling the truth about her actions. Then, you would've had a chance and actually been a decent person. Now? After the stunt that you did five months ago?  You're nothing but a sleazy turd."
