Cerberus demon dog...  (can only be killed by hades himself)

A dark possessed wolf huge its dark black pelt dripping blood and its huge red eyes with a hunger for blood and passion to kill..

You could see the struggle in its eyes as they flickered from green to red but the blood lust got the best of the large beast.

“Its no longer a wolf but a demon...” i whispered to myself as the large ferocious creature jumped at me its claws ready to strike me.
“Its all just a game to you isnt it!” I curled into a ball and looked at it with sad eyes seeing the pain it held inside.

The beast laughed “YeS YoUnG oNe ILl mAkE thiS QuIck.” I heard him say in my head. As he slashed my hand.

I shook my head with sorrow.

“Th-there is something i must try..” i whispered to my self.
I staggered back my hands covered in blood and pulled out a big stick i tossed it the beast and surprisingly  the large wolf glanced at it and glanced back at the stick I gave a gentle smile and pointed at the stick he dropped and chewed on the stick. 

Its eyes shone brightly and it smiled.. 
its dark eyes lit up. He looked like he had never seen anything but blood and torture never smiled, loved, played, or ever felt happy... He looked miserable. 

His sorrowful eyes glimmered as he sheathed his claws again and wiped my blood off his claws. 

I held out my hand and pat his head gently. And his eyes watered filled with happiness.

“Don’t worry wolf just cause everyone says your a demon doesn’t mean you have to be, you can be happy with your life.”

“I see you’ve never known what its really like to be loved.. only to be feared but the feeling of love can make you feel complete.”

I continued to pet his soft dark pelt as he dropped his head lying in my lap. 

“I’m sorry...” he whimpered his gentle tongue licked my blood off my hands as I continued to pet him and smiled at his bright glowing eyes.

He let out what seemed to be a purr as he fell asleep on my lap.

I smiled and whispered “i will show this beautiful wolf a life full of love...”  and i fell asleep too

A few moments later we woke up. 

I asked sweetly  “whats your name?”
He answered Cerberus.
 
“How about we call you Cerbi.” His eyes lit up as he licked me and I laughed. 

I led him up stairs and went to the pet store and came back.

“Here you go cerbi.” I plopped down a bed some toys with a bright smile on my face and wrapped a bright blue collar around his neck. 

He licked me and i smiled 
“So you like it” and he nodded

We went through everything together until one day..

When Hades showed up.

“Cerberus! You must return at once.”

Cerbi shook its head and stood by me snarling at lucifer.

 “I do not want to kill another soul I live with Luna now!”Cerbi said to hades.

“Well then what if there were no more luna!” He laughed throwing his staff at me Cerbi jumped taking the blow...

“Cerbi NO!” I cried

“Luna you have shown me what its like to have a life with love and affection thankyou for giving me a better life then what i ever imagined..” he whimpered falling limp

Furious hades went back to the underworld as i collapsed in tears holding Cerbi in my arms."

StoryTime,ero6v9n,t3_c1prgb,1561069823.0,"That sucks i got a switch and same thing happened to me I was using my switch and a little kid came over and saw it they kept screaming for it so my mom gave me the death glare and handed it to him she texted me saying it would be fine that the parents would “keep an eye on him” I come back to find my joycons broken leaving me infuriated. I hated doing this jut i had go use a warranty on the entire switch for joycons..
The kid is 7 i think but he looks 5 and is soo annoying i told him not to throw the joycons well he threw them and well i told him not to make a account on my switch he made one.

I don’t blame my mom though cause the people we were with are clients who get offended easily.

My older brother bought me my switch and i bought joycons and the pro control and we share it so both of us were angry because both of us are passionate about our game play etc especially in smash ultimate."
