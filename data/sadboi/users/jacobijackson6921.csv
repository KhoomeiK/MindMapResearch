offmychest,fagtzz5,t1_fagto1j,1576071230.0,I see what you’re saying now. Thanks I guess. It’s just hard to put the way I feel or don’t feel I guess into words obviously.
offmychest,fagsrb6,t1_fagiqex,1576070122.0,It’s just like I don’t get it.  Like I know what it is but I never can develop any special connection w anybody or develop any feelings like that and it drives me nuts because like I see everyone around me in these relationships but I can even begin to fathom how.
love,faexazn,t1_faevos3,1576010087.0,It’s just weird because like I know what love is obviously. I’m not that oblivious. But like I can’t mentally or physically produce the emotions and reactions I think I should.  Like a girl a while ago told me how she felt about me. But like I just didn’t feel anything. Not even like excitement. And usually guys would be jumping on that opportunity but like I just didn’t really care. At all.
depression,f8rd3u9,t3_e1nyjf,1574737459.0,Look. I can’t tell you whatever you’re going through will end up okay. Because what I am going through isn’t okay. But I can say that people do care about you if they tell someone you’re having those thoughts. They are mad at you because they care that much and they don’t want you to go. I urge you not to take suicide as your action and try to develop an even better relationship with those around you 🖤
depression,f8r9j6r,t1_f8r6b12,1574735157.0,Exactly how I feel. Like every time I’m driving I just want no pray to get hit but I’d never cause the accident to hurt myself.

depression,f837ib6,t1_f837afb,1574206055.0,I don’t have close friends or friends in general or anybody I’m comfortable enough with to talk to. It’s hard. Really. Really hard.
depression,f8376yy,t1_f833wo9,1574205860.0,"Yeah. I think only my family would miss me if I went to forever sleep. But I mean it just like. I always feel so low like don’t even want to get up. But like I’m so used to it. And I don’t want to be even more miserable to just “make something of myself”. In the grand scheme of things we are just here, existing. And nothing we will ever do will matter when the universe dies due to heat death in billions of years. Idk. It’s just all meaningless."
depression,f836vsq,t1_f835llk,1574205594.0,Also no. I’ve never tried therapy or meds because I don’t wanna be that guy. I’ve been here so long that being lonely and depressed is okay.

depression,f7styl2,t3_dxgy41,1573998177.0,I’m in the same situation and it’s been happening for around 2 years. Nobody talks to me so I just barely even talk anymore. Sometimes I won’t talk or text for days at a time.
Life,f7qbivd,t1_f7p0szz,1573961519.0,Okay. Thank you man.
Life,f7o6qtk,t1_f7o5xqj,1573921886.0,"It’s just hard. Like I went from someone who always had something to do I always had friends, to someone who can’t talk to someone face to face anymore and has none of those in just like a few short months. And now it’s been a long time.  Like it really fuckin sucks. And it’s hard to deal with it."
Life,f7o2ccq,t3_dw9t91,1573919566.0,"Maybe I’m so negative because my parents don’t care about me. Maybe I’m so negative because when my ex and I broke up she spread rumors about me and it got so bad I had to leave that school. Maybe it’s so bad because I’ve had literally not a single friend for the past 2 years. Maybe I’m so negative because I’m so depressed I cant even look anyone in the eyes anymore and I NEVER walk with my head up. Maybe I’m so negative because I don’t even really talk, eat, or sleep because a cumulative amount of shit piled on top of me. Idk just a thought. Being lonely when you have nobody sucks. When there is nobody to talk to and all you have is your shit thoughts consistently."

depression,f7i0c1v,t1_f7ht8i6,1573750708.0,Gotta “love” people like you. You never fuckin know what someone is going through. Ever. I hate people like you because when I attempted to kill myself it’s because people like you just said I was “seeking attention” or it was “all in my head” and I could never talk to anyone about it because of people like you. Stfu.
love,f7hzmec,t1_f7hz4do,1573750355.0,I wanna say it keeps me in a loop of being down about love. But I’m not sure.

Existential_crisis,f7hp6jy,t1_f7gqefv,1573744992.0,I definitely will try. Talking to someone about it which I never really have has helped me sleep better at night. It’s kinda nice to get the thoughts out sometimes
Existential_crisis,f7gfe75,t1_f7gezqc,1573702321.0,I’m 18. I think the first time I had these thoughts was about that same age of 11ish when my cat died (ironically) and I couldn’t shake the feeling of death and just what it was. I think that’s where all of this kinda started for me. I’m so glad you feel better :) it makes me feel better as well.

love,f7g1ag1,t3_dw167q,1573691972.0,I’m a senior in HS as well and I feel the same way and it sucks. I’ve been in a relationship one time and the whole time it was a lie. And ever since I’ve been out of it everyone is just disgusting and all I want is to love someone and it’s just frustrating. My whole life has just been a frustration and a mistake. Where is the red string of fate when you need it.
love,f7g0d95,t3_dvtw54,1573691279.0,I can try it’s just hard.

introvert,f7fp0ng,t3_dvyt1n,1573683986.0,One thing I wish people understood is sometimes I just want to be alone. I wish people would stop trying so hard to talk to me or be my friend. I’m just not a people person.
depression,f7fg6rp,t3_dvowus,1573678708.0,"I have these same thoughts. However no matter how many times I can’t get out of bed or no matter how many times I go a day without talking to anyone or looking in someone’s eyes , I won’t kill myself. I couldn’t do that to my family. They are the only people that even someone understand me."
Existential_crisis,f7fdy0c,t1_f7fdl7c,1573677370.0,"Yeah. That’s why I think nobody will every really know for certain what’s going on here. Because everyone has different views and beliefs and nobody really ever thinks the same thing, and I just think that that is amazing."
Existential_crisis,f7fcoxo,t1_f7fc5e4,1573676645.0,I just think that we are here. Existing. And that it’s crazy nobody else can. And I think of all the other possibilities of how it could’ve been anyone else born in my place and how beautiful and terrifying that is all at once. Like I said there is no third person perspective of this universe. Like nobody here will ever truly know what’s going on. And thats terrifyingly beautiful.
Existential_crisis,f7f5d7m,t1_f7f15m8,1573672786.0,Peace man thank you 🖤🌸
Existential_crisis,f7esvom,t1_f7es7uc,1573665073.0,I never talk to anyone anymore unless it’s my family but only for small things or over texting to relate to people.

depression_help,f7esg4y,t3_dvsgpl,1573664806.0,"You’re not. I have so much on my shoulders every day for the past 2ish years. I almost cried in the class I’m in right now. Just try to find the beauty in the little things. Like watching a leaf fall. The rain. Drawing those things you like, like anime, a show, things from a video game maybe. That’s how I barely get through the days."
depression,f7ersjw,t3_dvittj,1573664396.0,I hate sleep. It’s like mini dying. Even if I never have a good experience anymore like I just can’t sleep very well.
Existential_crisis,f7eooiz,t1_f7eoe9f,1573662429.0,I mean there might. I just can’t imagine someone being able to talk about this kinda stuff because it’s just there. In our heads. And people who don’t understand can’t and won’t.
Existential_crisis,f7elp7u,t1_f7elbb4,1573660509.0,"Like I think this life is beautiful and being here on the off chance is beautiful , but like it’s just , why. I guess. Why did I have to have these thoughts and why do I have to be so sad. It’s just idek"

Existential_crisis,f7ekjvk,t1_f7ejylo,1573659752.0,I’m not sure if there are people who can deal with this level of overthinking actually. At least I don’t think anyone could talk me out of these thoughts at least. I deal with these thoughts on top of depression and it’s scary sometimes. I’d look into it if it concerns you that much.
Existential_crisis,f7ebau2,t1_f7e78lh,1573652982.0,See but like I don’t wanna live forever either because after a while you’d eventually just want it to end.
depression_help,f7dgqez,t1_f7dbto2,1573616353.0,I just have a whatever happens happens attitude. If I’m gonna die then so be it. I’m kinda afraid to die tho. Even tho I never really experience anything good anymore like it’s still like do I really wanna experience nothing ever ? Or if god and shit is real do I really wanna only experience good forever ? That sounds kinda like hell to me. I dunno.
depression,f7cztdg,t1_f7cyxx5,1573603986.0,It’s terrible thinking so much. It really. Truly is.
depression,f7cyt58,t1_f7cyku1,1573603258.0,It’s just like I think a lot. And I overthink a lot. It’s not like “questioning my existence” it’s more just more like thinking about existence and what life is is what I more so mean. It’s just really weird and confusing to think about.
depression,f7cy8d9,t1_f7cxwvm,1573602856.0,Well I just had another breakdown then my first thought is let’s get on reddit :) I wish someone or anyone could be there. But it’s just a fantasy. I feel like I just do it without thinking for some reason but I just like examine my hand. I’m not sure why but I only started doing it a few months ago. It’s weird but calming. I feel like I’m almost checking to see if I’m real or not. Or holding my hand out to someone

depression,f7c1jyw,t3_dv8n9a,1573582375.0,"The worst part about being actually depressed is people think it’s just for attention and leave you. But really you just want a friend. Someone to talk to. Silence is what is killing me the most I think.

depression,f7c0o4x,t3_dv8jgk,1573581814.0,I feel the same way and I only have 1 friend in real life because I open up and people run. I just tear up out of nowhere now and pray it doesn’t happen at school and push me deeper into the hole of having no friends. I don’t even look people in the eyes or look up in the hallways anymore. I’ve started unconsciously waking up and reaching up with my right hand hoping someone grabs it but of course nobody ever will. Idk man.

It’s not that I’m not a decent looking guy or like I don’t have money to do things. I just like I have 0 motivation to climb out of this hole. And i don’t know why. I think most of it stems from my ex spreading rumors about me and it got so bad I had to switch schools and I think that’s what has gotten to me.
