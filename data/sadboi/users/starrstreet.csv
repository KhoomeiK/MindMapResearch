He said I'll move on, find someone who loves cats, shares more interests, & not do this to me. And said he feels sorry not for forgiveness but sorry for me, and wishes he could answer the why he did it but he can't. He wanted to have his awesome gf here and have temporary fleeting fun over there and thought I would never get hurt. 

He's an asshole and wasn't the partner I or he thought he was. The end. I like the closure I got because this letter really highlighted all the great things I bring to a relationship that I didn't realize and that I deserve so much more cause I have all this to give. 

For now, I'll go hoe it up through sexts and videos with old flings until this whole quarentine blows over, cheers."

He says he hates cheaters and hates himself too much to be with me right now even if I wasn't breaking it off with him. That he needs time to reflect and evaluate who he is as a person.

Told me though I'm so intelligent, interesting, thoughtful, & amazing with his kids and what he is losing is enormous. That no one deserves this especially me. 

So I don't know once the ""time heals all wounds"" comes will he fight harder. I think now he's not cause he's ashamed."

The not having sex with him for a night every now and then did worry me in the back of my mind and I said are you going to break up with me? What if I get cancer and can't, are you going to break up with me? I just never thought he would cheat. 

By the way, these were ex flings/dates/partners that he broke it off with for different reasons. I have heard of him talk about them during our relationship just not by name. Like, ""that crazy girl that yelled at our waiter"" "" that one who lived too far"" etc"

I know he didn't physically cheat just because he's a MAJOR germaphob and only did a sexual thing on quarentine with me once during this at a far enough distance (lol ridiculous.)

He said though he could not know what was going to happen once we could start being together again. He said he might've continued being a monster, can't be sure, there was no plan."
