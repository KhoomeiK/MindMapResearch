I keep glass a short time because we travel for a living. I only keep 4 pieces and I can’t help but buying new toys and selling the excess. It’s a great piece I just have to make room. I am keeping my big Apix tube so I don’t feel too bad! Questions? Ask me!"
CPTSD,fpx3mlv,t1_fpwmkcu,1588975033.0,"My therapist used to encourage anger at the right person. It felt like she was encouraging my anger but she wasn’t exactly. She said get angry if you’re angry just direct it exactly where it belongs, and specifically NOT at myself. So I got that, but also staying angry doesn’t help me. As long as I don’t start hating myself and all my perceived flaws, which is when I usually self harm. Which I haven’t done in almost two years. So anger is a tricky road to navigate for me. I sometimes tell myself “I already got angry about this...I don’t need to pollute my mind and body with this anger “ so I validate it, because it’s justified, but spare myself the anguish of reliving the anger or tempting that anger to get ahold of me, by remembering the feeling of anger for a moment. I usually have to check my body and relax it back. It’s also very hard with all this time alone to not ruminate."

iamatotalpieceofshit,foe4twx,t3_g6yn60,1587696045.0,"Yeah. I agree with the OP. Grocery workers make what, $13 an hour? No one calling them brave heroes, but the fucking nurses act like they’re not making $125k a year with full family health benefits, two to four weeks paid vacation, and a 401k. They did choose a career of danger. They just chose based on salary and job availability and not “helping people” that’s a bunch of crap. My husband is in radiology, and is exposed just as much as nurses all day in the hospital. He wears masks, adheres to safety protocol when doing Covid rule outs, and showers immediately when he comes home. Yes, he could bring it home to me and we could get sick, but it’s a choice, no? He could quit and refuse to work, and be out of work. But it’s his job. His job is to be exposed to scabies, which he has been, and his job is to get punched in the face by a drunk and disorderly patient in the ER, which he has, his job is to handle AIDS patients, and elderly people with pneumonia, that’s his JOB. But guess what? The housekeeping staff, orderlies, transporters at the hospital are exposed just as much as he is, as the nurses and doctors are, but no one is singing the praises of the guys who have to carry dead infected bodies out of the hospital, and they get paid about $13 an hour. The nurses make on average $50 an hour. Real brave. My husband isn’t brave, he is doing his job. He chose the job. He knew the risks. He has to go to the hospital whether it’s four feet of snow, a hurricane, or a pandemic."

They are at complete odds with the tenets of their so called “beliefs” - as somehow, the dead are once again, “those people”- but their Jesus would have acted much differently in the context of their bible. Jesus would have ministered to them and healed and helped and etc. given his clothes and food - compassion yadda yadda.

CannabisExtracts,fn2b9y2,t1_fn1ou9b,1586583249.0,"My advice is get a good banger. I opted for Hoyes glass. I got a 25% discount. Pretty sure there’s one out there. I think it was $150 and I paid $130 with shipping. Totally worth it. In fact there’s a Hoyes on eBay for like $80. I spent $275 on a good rig, but you can easily find a nice used one on reddit or Instagram for under $200. I got an ApixDesign. I have a whip it torch and a scorch torch. Both ok. I want a big blazer but until I find the color I want, I haven’t bought it yet. The glass makes a huge difference and you have to clean it each and every time you use it. Cannot reheat it unless you’ve cleaned it with iso and rinsed it. The enail sucked in that it kept the heat on and the glass just chazzed up in a day. I hated it. Wasted a lot of product too.  And that damn wire. Annoying. I do low low temp dabs. Taste is better. Cleanup is easier (always clean with dry qtip while banger still hot, then iso, then rinse and dry) and I use a splash guard or cold start type banger (Hoyes beaker banger) so I can reheat without ruining the glass. I enjoy the dabbing. The whole process. Using the puffco is fine but it takes away the pageantry and the some of the enjoyment."
glassheads,fn1s82s,t3_fxkkvo,1586568892.0,That’s not a thing. Chazzing is different. Only chumps have chazzy bangers. Don’t overheat it. And clean it every time. It will last years.

But I don’t like them much. I finally went for a splash guard type banger. I got a Hoyes beaker banger and I have no chazzing whatsoever anymore. If anything just get a temp indicator or an infrared temp gauge and you will be fine. You can try but the fun experience is missing with the puffco.

But just got a new setup with 10mm and in these times I can’t afford two setups. But this is the best banger I ever had. Cleans easy with the qtips and works great with low temp and even cold start. Best thing is you can reheat 4 seconds a few times with no chance of chazzing - I want another hoyes in 10 mm.
