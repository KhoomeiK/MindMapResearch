2020 has not been a good year."
askgaybros,fmwhx3n,t3_fxqeje,1586446891.0,"Considering the LGBT community faces higher rates of mental illness, substance abuse, addiction... You would think we’d be capable of decency towards one another.  

That’s sadly not the case. Whether it’s ignorance, a lack of empathy, or the inability to perceive another’s struggles as legitimate... we just don’t know."

nursing,fm25v63,t1_fm212iz,1585691166.0,"There is a potential issue. Hell, it’s not even potential! That is what you’re trying to justify, if you didn’t think there was an issue you wouldn’t be seeking other’s opinion. 

If you don’t want to feel “moral obligation” to other people’s health and safety, you shouldn’t be a nurse and that’s that."

nursing,fm1xk2t,t3_fskmfm,1585686818.0,"You are a nurse working with vulnerable populations. This is highly unprofessional and irresponsible. You willingly chose to ignore social distancing guidelines.

I’m sorry, but as a healthcare worker you should know better."

Saying shit like this adds stigma to people who actually NEED IT TO FUNCTION and don’t use it as a party drug."
askgaybros,fl760pr,t3_fn09xf,1584895017.0,"Leave him. This is major disrespect to you. There is no changing him if this is another occurrence. Allowing him to get away with it the first time has told him you might allow him to get away with it again, and again, and again.

In my 3 year relationship with the man I planned to marry... I made excuses and reasoned it away. All the time on Grindr, the videos of him fucking someone while I was at work 

They don’t stop. You will be in a state of constant emotional turmoil and self-depreciation that he will take advantage of to keep you by his side. 

You deserve better."
askgaybros,fkclyhy,t3_fhgcgl,1584055927.0,"This is going to be dark; but a chokehold. Get your arm around his neck, hold your wrist with your non dominant hand and have his throat in the crux of your inner elbow.

I know this because I’m 6’1 and 185 pounds.... And my ex almost managed to choke me to death and rendered me powerless by doing this. So it works. Even more so if you can get him on his side."

askgaybros,f232xfy,t3_dbjfbi,1569904213.0,"When I was a teenager I had long hair and was about 240 pounds.  Cystic acne kicked my ass pretty hard, my face is permanently scarred. (Couldn't take accutane because mental illness) The insults and degredation from both gay men and my peers was consistent to the point I became entirely antisocial. 

Fast forward to my 20s, I'm 188 pounds of (mostly) lean muscle with short hair. Men never comment on my acne anymore, I get treated a lot better. It's gross. No one ever deserves to be treated poorly because of their weight."
