I also stay away from eggs and Doritos/orange flavouring which seem to exacerbate the eyes but orange fruits, mandarines, oranges help with increasing my energy levels without a fast decline (because fruit).

I don‚Äôt know if that really answers your question but trying to eat healthy and maintaining happy insides will surely help with the lethargy and (maybe) the yellow eyes."

If she‚Äôd like to talk to someone about crystals I‚Äôd be happy to talk about how I went about my journey.

If you‚Äôd like to buy her some stones I‚Äôd recommend Rose Quartz, Clear Quartz, Amethyst, Citrine, and whatever her birthstone is.

Citrine is associated with the Solar Plexus which governs your stomach and digestion and Smokey Quartz is a fantastic grounding stone for when you‚Äôre thoughts are all over the place.

Another great stone is black tourmaline which I find very heavy and great to relax with but I‚Äôd be careful as it‚Äôs a dark stone and won‚Äôt help ‚Äòlift‚Äô your mood. Turquoise will calm your mind and keep you at peace though."

The first step is acknowledging the behaviour, so you‚Äôve got that far which is awesome. Congrats!

Secondly, have you spoken to him about it? Make him know that you are aware of your behaviours and you don‚Äôt mean to cause harm intentionally. Try to point out things that trigger the behaviour and ask that he keeps it to a minimum. Be sure to tell him how much you appreciate and value the relationship and that it‚Äôs not his fault that any of this exists. 

If you‚Äôre open about the fact you‚Äôre looking to change the behaviours, and he is as committed as you are, he should be supportive of you. If you want to chat about some of my own techniques message me :)"
