And I’ll throw Lisa Ann out there because she started in the 90s, spent a whole decade looking like Sarah Palin, and now has the ex-pornstar glam look."

Hey Dude, I’m not at my best after another late night out at oxygen bars with my friends. I woke up feeling like crap, told them that’s it! That’s “the Last Air Bender!” I hope you Doug that. I have to go tell my roommate James that movie with the Daft Punk soundtrack is on tv. “Jimmy! New Tron”!"

She’s fucking beautiful so it’s hard to see her as jo material if that’s all you want atm but maybe it’s because I haven’t seen any of her harder stuff? Like I love Kira Noir, I don’t need to see what the inside of her butthole looks like. Personally, her online accounts are too good not to have a crush on her. Her Twitter is usually great and her insta is A+ with bits and updates."
