SuicideWatch,eru4oha,t3_c3yctz,1561262966.0,"If you really put your mind to it, there is still hope for you to pass, trust me. This is supposedly the last thing you are doing, right? So why not give it all you've got? You have nothing to lose. And I hope you can see you still have time to pass. But even if you fail, I hope you can reconsider. It seems by your suicide letter that you still have people who care for you. Think of them and the scars it will leave when you're gone. Hopefully, you can talk to someone and see that you can still turn your life around."
SuicideWatch,eru4613,t3_c3yvpj,1561262484.0,"You may think that now but you honestly never know. In a few years, you could be the light of someone else's life. Plus, there are people who take away far more value from this world than you could ever. I hope you will find the purpose to go on."
SuicideWatch,eru3tc5,t3_c3y6ko,1561262147.0,Please don't think you are weak for failing your suicide attempts. You are incredibly strong for putting all the bullshit your life has fed you. Is there any way you could talk to someone besides your parents? I'm sure there is someone who cares for you. I truly hope you seek therapy once you are able to.
SuicideWatch,eru39bb,t3_c3xwui,1561261603.0,"It seems like you've put up with a lot of emotional abuse. If it isn't too late, I hope you can seek counseling or therapy. I'm absolutely certain there are many people in this world who would love to be with you. You just need to find them and separate yourself from the cunts telling you these things. I am very sorry for all the pain you have been put through."
SuicideWatch,eru31o9,t3_c3y5n1,1561261400.0,"I am so sorry for the pain you have been put through. I hope you can find your peace. If however, there is any chance you read through these comments, I beg you to reconsider. People often make decisions they wouldn't otherwise when they undergo traumatic experiences - especially hard breakups. I hope your ex doesn't blame himself too much if you go through with it. Rest easy."
SuicideWatch,eru2t8v,t1_eru02yj,1561261174.0,"It looks like you are very distressed at the moment and that is completely understandable given your situation. But it seems like you are especially upset because of the recent events that you have gone through and I am truly sorry for what you have had to endure. I really hope you will not do anything rash though. You say it got better after high school for a while - there is still hope that you can get to that point again. I'm sure you've felt this way before, but you've managed to get through it. Even if it feels like there is no hope for you, please know it is never too late to get your life together. As far as we know, this may be the only chance we get to be conscious, and I think we should make the most of it even if it becomes almost unbearable at times. I hope you can turn yourself around even if you think there is no hope left. Either way, I hope you can find peace."
SuicideWatch,eru1wbf,t3_c34ko8,1561260304.0,"I am extremely sorry for your loss. This is one of the saddest stories I have ever read. I know how hard it must be for you to move past this. Just know you are probably one of, if not the best thing to ever happen to her during her life. You provided her with happiness that she likely did not have for years before you met her, and that should be forever cherished by you both. I hope you can continue to grow as a person even after this horrendous experience."
Showerthoughts,er8u1na,t1_er8ru4o,1560611713.0,"Yeah I understand that. Not saying there's a single thing that would cause the most suffering. But after accounting for everyone's relative preferences, there is still someone who has probably suffered the most."
