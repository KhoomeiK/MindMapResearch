I have mixed feeling on the hate speech thing. punching Nazis is wrong and that i stand with 100% but criminalizing hate speech is harder to pin down, i think discriminatory views need to be discussed as a way to avoid easy indoctrination, but i also think such that giving these people a platform can be harmful or lead to violence. it a tough one"

changemyview,fl2f7cv,t1_fl24lbw,1584749628.0,"we both know that those are outstanding outliers. police are generally there to protect you, the only major thing is you cant sue them if they fail at that job. plus the supreme court do not make the laws they rule on whether or not something is justified within those laws. Our legal system operates on a system of precedent. If a law does not change than legal precedent is often used to decide a case, so repeated rulings often occur. If you dont like it then you should blame the law makers and not the judges.

&#x200B;

as ive stated in other comments i do believe that violence to protect someone who is being attacked is justified, but i think it should be the minimum amount possible and you should get the person to safety as soon as possible. if someone breaks into my house (which happened a few times) i go for the option of slamming a door behind them and holding them in there with a chair. I do not know how dangerous they might be and i have a little sister to protect.

&#x200B;

as far as the teamfourstar line, i absolutely love that line and i think it 100% qualifies as poetry. I have thought about it a lot actually since i first heard it. But i still believe that violence is wrong. In that situation Cell is a monster and not standing up to him would be a wrong act. But this situation is unlike any in real-life. Cell is a monster of unimaginable power and literally nothing but violence can stop him. That is not a scenario i believe exists."
changemyview,fkvy81y,t1_fkvsqyj,1584579266.0,"I believe fleeing from an attacker is a far better alternative to attempting to attack them back, or fortifying a location. The failure is in ending up in a situation where you cannot do either thing and are forced to fight.

&#x200B;

I agree completely with your second part that war is unnecessary with such access to communication at our disposal, but i would add that there is war in defense and that by the time there is negotiations it can sometimes be too late. A monstrous person might be in power and the failure has already happened within that country."
changemyview,fkvxd1j,t1_fkvs6u7,1584578727.0,"In the case of Argentina that would fall under self defense and that is a necessity. once it gets to the point of fight or die then you must fight (same goes for fight or let die) but this situation is a failure, it must be avoided at all costs. Negotiations are not the only other way and as i am not omnipotent i can not always give a solution that is better, and as far as the argentina and peru thing goes i do not know enough about the situation to speak on it. Stopping monstrous people from gaining power is an important step though. proper education is the key to that."
changemyview,fkvwtsr,t1_fkvrfi6,1584578410.0,Law enforcement is something i hadnt considered before. However i do think that violence in law enforcement should be minimised as much as possible. the less harm done the better. **Î”**

changemyview,fkvwdpf,t1_fkvrl3a,1584578135.0,"well ww2 is a case of it becoming absolutely necessary. But it was a failure.

changemyview,fkvvclg,t1_fkvqttm,1584577505.0,"Okay i think the allied powers had no choice by the time of the war, but i think that the situation could have and should have been avoided.

unpopularopinion,fkvrbjl,t1_fel3c2j,1584575090.0,I am late but here is my counter-point. They become nazis because they are already alone and afraid. It is easy to brainwash someone who feels isolated. Punching them will only further entrench them into their views.
outofcontextcomics,fkvnyu8,t1_fkvew3q,1584573105.0,i think that it is entirely possible for someone to join the Nazi party for fear of attack or to even throw people off so they could harbor more Jewish people. I also think that many former nazis may well be reformed if they weren't at the time. the indoctrination bordered on brainwashing and it was everywhere. i think we should always operate on a case-by-case basis.
outofcontextcomics,fkvnhkc,t1_fkulwmy,1584572824.0,no this is true though. forcing them to hide their ideas isnt helping us get rid of them. do not assault people because they have bad ideas. we want to be able to easily access their ideas so we can thoroughly debunk them and maybe even deconvert them.
outofcontextcomics,fkvn79s,t1_fkvlfk8,1584572658.0,This kind of thing helps nazi-ism spread. You make them feel like an out-group and it makes them feel special. If its easy to convince people that the world is against them then they can be convinced of anything. battle their ideas civilly and respectfully and you can make real change.
