It's a false sense of inclusion. When people say ""toxic masculinity"" they think well I'm a man, so that must include me, even though I'm also struggling with showing emotion too. Instead of acknowledging a problem and working to make it better they just shut it down because they don't want it to reflect poorly on them. 

Like, I'm a white American, I can acknowledge that racism exists in this country. I'm not afraid that will reflect poorly on me because I don't do or say things that are racist.

AmItheAsshole,fpdtbzv,t3_gcq342,1588533815.0,"NTA This is grossly unprofessional on their part. At the very least they should have sent you a menu with price per head. Yeah, you should have asked but hindsight is 20/20 and you're planning a freaking wedding!! You have 100 other things to sort out. Doesn't Marissa realize you have a BUDGET for your wedding?? I think she's trying to take advantage of you. I wouldn't pay her!"
AmItheAsshole,fpdrszj,t3_gcoc8s,1588532934.0,"ESH besides your sister. You need to talk to your parents about your feelings towards your adopted sister. I'm sure there's more to the story. Maybe they always wanted a second child and weren't able to. Maybe she came from a really bad situation and they wanted to step in and help her. It's kind of shitty they didn't talk to you about it beforehand especially since you're sharing a bedroom. But it's not about you. And it's not your sister's fault either. 

I know what it's like being a teen girl. I was you not too long ago. It's rough. But you're totally taking it out on the wrong person. I think you're entitled to have some things just for you, and you can have a good relationship with your sister too. I have a sister a year older than me and she's my best friend now. We did a lot of stuff together but also had our own interests, hobbies, and friends. I think you owe your sister an apology, but please talk to your parents too."
