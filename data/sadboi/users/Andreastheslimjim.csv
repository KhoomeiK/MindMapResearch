She's saying that 95% of schizophrenics aren't violent or ""crazy"" like the extreme cases, portrayals in the media, and misrepresentations like Sybil. That being said, schizophrenia is ABSOLUTELY a viable justification for innocence by reason of insanity its just remarkably rare to become that sick (like a richard chase or a kallinger)

""Elyn Saks first started noticing that something was wrong when she was 16. One day, and without reason, she suddenly left her classroom and started walking home. It turned into an agonizing journey in which she believed all the houses in her neighborhood were transmitting hostile and insulting messages directly into her brain. Five years later, while attending law school at Oxford, she experienced her first complete schizophrenic break.

Explain how John hopkins medicine, yale medical studies, the American College of Emergency Physicians (which alone employs 36000 physicians and disease specialists), the American Academy of emergency medicine, and the WHO. Explain how they are ALL wrong. 

Also stop changing the subject. It's embarrassing. Im not debating texas anymore because I've shown you the evidence for my point from multiple credible sources and you refuse to adjust your views like a rational person. Until you can refute the evidence i provided/the evidence my sources provide, you're wrong. Thats how reality works. Normally i wouldnt let someone run away with their dick between their thighs when they try to change the topic of discussion but fine. Lets discuss florida, their representation and transparency during the pandemic, and that pitiful article you linked.


- The only important aspect of that link whatsoever is the FDA chairman saying ""more tests means higher confirmed cases"". Yeah. No shit. I've already AGREED WITH YOU on that point way back if you're even able to keep up anymore. Check first few original comments in this debate.

Let's talk about Desantis and his lies/misinformed nonsense about corona. 

- He falsely claimed no one under 25 has died

- after his surgeon general provided hard evidence that social distancing is among the most important ways to combat this virus, Desantis kicked him out of the briefing.

- The state of florida ordered that medical examiners stop releasing data on corona deaths. Desantis is currently trying to squash a legal battle over this exact issue.

- Desantis planned to open up schools because ""it doesn't seem to affect children"" when children are considered the most effective carriers by the WHO and the CDC. He was warned by many health agencies and political peers to not open up schools.

- according to the Miami governor (who does not have a history of lying about/actively suppressing corona data) in accordance with state officials claimed that the ""state's deadliest day yet occurred Tuesday, when a reported 72 people died of the virus in 24 hours. The number of confirmed cases in the state was still increasing steadily throughout the week"". 

I can provide sources for all of these instances but hopefully you'll be an adult and look it up yourself so i don't have to keep holding your hand. 

Ahh finally your article you linked. Your link has no empirical data, nothing of substance, only has a vague point that I've already agreed with you on (even though the vague quote from the FDA chairman would need actual data to prove any form of a point you're making) and the rest of the article is from desantis's mouth and if you believe him then....well... Idk man.

Infact let me show you the exact exchange we had over this where i agreed with you.

- ""So Dallas was already spiking and we don’t know yet whether or not the “reopening” has caused the spike or not as I said, coronabro.""

- ""I literally said I don't disagree with you on that?""

If statistics aren't my friend then they are certainly your worst enemy. You wanna keep this going? Stop changing the subject before you have me bounce through all 50 states to desperately prove your point. Either provide evidence for your claim or evidence that disputes mine, or learn to accept being wrong. Its almost like pandemics will behave the exact same way that pandemics always have and its almost like that behavior is backed up my modern medicine and documented science. I'm not responding to you until you, once again, provide proof for your claims that isnt easily debunkable"

Here are some more updated numbers as Saudi has been slowly but surely making improvements and steps in the right direction.

1. The country is highly urbanized with close 85% of its population living in cities and many impoverished citizens, estimated to be around four million Saudis, reside in slums on the outskirts of those cities. There are still massive issues with housing prices, housing descrimination, etc.


https://www.statista.com/statistics/262497/degree-of-urbanization-in-saudi-arabia/

2. According to the Borgin Project 
Saudi Arabia had the lowest reported poverty rate in the Middle East and 10th in the world at 12.7 percent, as of 2017. However, the Saudi government does not release regular statistics regarding this information, resulting in varied estimates by outside agencies. That being said most figures that are current have drastically shifted in terms of the poverty rate 

3. According to the world bank their life expectancy have drastically risen just a few years and the government is actively trying to combat poverty with a multi decade plan

4. Not disputing the income inequality though it is easily the biggest economic issue they have besides their bonkers leaders, their corrupt army, various religious factions, child slavery, child brides and infinite other issues. 

5. Once again ive lived there. Never once faced any hatred and the people there were always great to my family. Are there psychos that would have lynched my whole family? Absolutely. But we played it smart and over time settled in. Saudi is a deeply fucked up place but when progress is being made for once we need to recognize it and support it."

JusticeServed,fp2shbc,t1_foxub68,1588267144.0,"""She said C-Tran had dispatched a security officer to a nearby Vine bus stop for a report of an intoxicated person there. The security officer approached the intoxicated man and told him to leave, Selk said. But as the security officer turned to get his phone, the male ran across Fourth Plain and into a man pushing a shopping cart. A physical fight ensued, and the security officer called police, she said.

Police arrived and confronted the man with the shopping cart, Ellis said. The man threw rocks at the responding officers and metal objects, possibly pieces of construction rebar.

Police tried to use a Taser weapon, but its prongs stuck in the man’s jacket and he brushed them off, according to Ellis. He then donned a second jacket. The suspect then went to throw a piece of rebar at an officer, Ellis said, who shot at him in response""

The article mentions he had sharp objects he wouldnt drop, he kept advancing on officers that tried less than lethal means, then he started moving towards an officer still ignoring everything they're saying. Its tragic, especially if this resulted from some form mental break or psychotic condition but i really dont see how this wasn't justified"

JusticeServed,fp2qbko,t1_fos5lu9,1588266106.0,grow the fuck up snowflake. Who cares? Literally any decent and rational person does. If you say and do dumb shit people are gonna call you out on it. understanding that is called being an adult. If you think someone calling a bigot a bigot....makes them a bigot then that makes me question how many tallboys your mom drank with you in her belly.

worldnews,fp2luzp,t1_fp28tqa,1588263983.0,"How come? Saudis poverty rates tend to fluctuate around 25-30 percent if i remember correctly. There are plenty of honest workers that make a good living there. Not trying to defend saudi arabia (and especially not their fucking government) but by far the majority of its people are relatively successful and quite alot of them extremely so. They live normal lives like you and me and my family. That being said there still public executions for stealing fruit. It was a weird but fascinating place to be. My dad hit some corporate dudes car and he paid my dads car off, covered his own expenses, and then just gave my dad what equalled at the time about 2,000 dollars. Just cause he had never met a swedish guy before. The people that are really rich there INSANELY rich"
worldnews,fp287go,t1_fp27nb8,1588257072.0,My family lived there. The successful people in that country are beyond wealthy. Im sure we're getting closer to the well running dry but as long as they got oil they'll be raking in that cash

TrueCrime,fozoi7x,t1_foznx2i,1588194107.0,Well said. I couldn't even watch it lol. Pretty sure they left a couple of forensic details out and when he was DESPERATELY trying to string his bizarre story together in the first episode.....i fully believe he did it but hey some cases just never see justice
TrueCrime,fozmrkr,t1_fot1c1h,1588193263.0,Staircase is good but its quite biased. If i remember correctly peterson was sleeping with one of the documentary producers. Totally no conflict of interest there lol
TrueCrime,fozlm49,t1_fox4ymf,1588192714.0,Yeah he was using a different name and an episode aired on americas most wanted that featured the case. The neighbor then realized who he really was. Such an insane story

It's a fascinating case don't get me wrong but i find guys like kallinger, pickton, gecht, heidnik, etc to be far more interesting and infinitely more terrifying. Maybe I'm just over Saturated with Bundy content?"
LPOTL,fonq6tu,t3_g85tio,1587924316.0,"I've been waiting for this. The details of the insanely brutal murders, the satanic aspect, the group dynamics, there's so much to unpack in this case. Definitely read Deadly thrills by Jay Slade fletcher, the woman who investigated the case. It's remarkably fucked up and its PERECT LP material"
LPOTL,fonpyki,t1_fom9een,1587924191.0,"He worked for gacy but didnt work for him personally or directly and if i remember correctly its cited in ""deadly thrills"" by jay slade fletcher that he admitted that he let the press run with the story for a while.
