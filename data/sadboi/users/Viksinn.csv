If your computer can handle it, the game can look really good with some texture packs. 

Little tip, go for the fighters guild quests early on. Most are basically just assassination or fetch quests and the difficulty scales pretty gently, so you'll be able to get plenty of level ups and gear without worrying too much about getting killed.

Besides that if you want to be a mage then there's a mod called enhanced magic or something similar that vastly improves spellcraft without breaking or overpowering it.

Take it slow and enjoy the immersion, that's the best way to play oblivion IMO"
