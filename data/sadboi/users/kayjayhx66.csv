I know that at my school, we were small and private so if someone failed they would have to do an advanced remediation course at the end of the semester. If you were a P3 about to go out on APPEs, they would rearrange your schedule so that your first block was used for remediation. Unfortunately every school is different, so if you are comfortable/able to ask your peers if they know of anyone who has failed a class and maybe seek out that person for advice? I’m sure you aren’t the first one that this has happened to! Keep your head up and learn from your mistakes during this class. If it makes you feel any better, I know three people who failed out of one pharmacy school and still got accepted into another one to finish their degree. You’ll have options no matter what!"
TheRightCantMeme,fqzpmgu,t1_fqzopi2,1589772497.0,"That was your response to him. I am replying specifically to your response to me where you claim that numerous false allegations happen. You can ‘not allow someone to make blanket statements’ until your face turns blue, but replying to my comment stating that false allegations are numerous was blatantly false. I will forever and always believe that someone is innocent until proven guilty and will support anyone that is falsely accused of rape. I will not allow someone to post single Wikipedia story and not provide any data about false rape allegations and then when given these facts, let them gloss over it like they didn’t read the information. 


I acknowledge that your original comment was replying to someone who made a false statement about rape laws. That doesn’t excuse you from the false information you put into your comments and it also doesn’t excuse you from reading the statistics I gave you and replying accordingly."

I could find much better articles and studies for you if I was at my computer and it wasn’t so late at night. Tomorrow I’ll look for some false accusations as well and compare the statistics from more reliable sources. I’m sure that those will also confirm that rape is more common than what is even reported and false accusations are extremely rare."
TheRightCantMeme,fqzmgov,t1_fqzklyy,1589770459.0,"I appreciate your apologies, but I don’t think that you understand where I’m coming from. Yes, men can and have been falsely accused of rape. That’s awful and I feel for every man who ever had to go through that situation. Here’s where I think you don’t understand why I replied: it seems that every time rape is discussed now, someone like you has to come in and invalidate our struggles by stating a man can be falsely accused. We know. We hear it every time we talk about our trauma. Since you didn’t want to post data from google, I will: 

“One commonly cited figure holds that 5 percent of rape allegations are found to be false, but that figure paints a very incomplete picture, says Belknap. Typically, this figure comes from studies done on college students, an estimated 95 percent of whom do not report their assaults to police. Overall, an estimated 8 to 10 percent of women are thought to report their rapes to the police, which means that — at the very highest — we can infer that 90 percent of rapes go unreported, says Belknap. Obviously, only those rapes that are reported in the first place can be considered falsely reported, so that 5 percent figure only applies to 10 percent (at most) of rapes that occur. This puts the actual false allegation figure closer to 0.5 percent.”
[link 2](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thecut.com/amp/article/false-rape-accusations.html) 

“Misconceptions about false reporting rates have direct, negative consequences and can contribute to why many victims don’t report sexual assaults”

“The best data we have — the number of people prosecuted for making false allegations — suggests that the average adult man in England and Wales has a 0.00021281 per cent chance of being falsely accused of rape in a year. (That’s based on 35 prosecutions for false rape allegations in 2011 compared to 16.5 million men aged 16 to 59 living in England and Wales at the time).”
[link 3](https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-men-are-more-likely-to-be-raped-than-be-falsely-accused-of-rape) 


Bottom line, false accusations are rare. Actual rape is much more prevalent than is reported. Next time you think about bringing up false rape when someone discusses an actual rape that occurred, please consider referring to google or doing more in-depth research besides Wikipedia. 
(New to linking websites so I hope it works out ok)."
TheRightCantMeme,fqzjzm4,t1_fqzhqxp,1589768998.0,"Just out of curiosity, do you know the statistics of how many females are raped vs how many false accusations there are? As a female in her 20s, I can personally say I’ve experienced it AND I can name 10 people close to me (male and female) who have those experiences. Please don’t play this card when you know damn well that actual rape and false accusations are not nearly similar in numbers. Sure, we have no idea what the actual numbers are, but I also know that myself and many of the other people I can list who have been sexually assaulted and raped, never came forward because of the repercussions. This sad old story is exactly that, sad and old for everyone. Sure we could have come forward, but instead we chose to live our lives with it and read posts from people like you who belittle the experience. Unless you’ve been raped or you’ve been accused of a rape you didn’t do, I don’t think your single WIKIPEDIA article is enough to justify the point you’re trying to make.


Edit: I forgot to mention that unfortunately I also know multiple guys who I was friends who who raped a few girls. The only people I don’t know is anyone who was falsely accused. Weird how all that adds up."

ShaneDawson,fq4pcxx,t1_fq38mb7,1589081078.0,"Went back and reread it once more because I was so confused, but the title is extremely misleading if you didn’t read the entire article. 
“Researchers at the South Korean centre for disease control and prevention (CDC) now say it is impossible for the COVID-19 virus to reactivate in human bodies.” 
So basically they confirmed the virus itself will not reactivate from inside the body after your body kills the virus. With infections like HIV the virus is able to become dormant and can reinfect a human. It’s kind of in your cell DNA when that occurs, which is why HIV is a lifelong illness. 
They did NOT confirm that a person cannot get infected with the virus from an outside source after already having the virus. We don’t know if it’s like the flu where you can have different strains that change. We don’t know what can happen honestly, but this is terrifyingly false advertisement."

It says that the CDC is warning against immunity passports and below I have two direct word for word quotes from the article. 

Quotes from the article: 

In an update to its guidance, the WHO warned there was ""no evidence that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection""

The CDC added that unlike other viruses, such as HIV and chickenpox - which can break into the nucleus of human cells and stay latent for years before reactivating - the coronavirus stays outside of the host cell's nucleus.
""This means it does not cause chronic infection or recurrence,"" explained Dr Oh Myoung-don, the head of the CDC committee, meaning it is unlikely for patients to relapse in this fashion."

I truly wish I could come get your daughter and bring her here so I can comfort her and explain why masturbation is ok. 
Oh my blood is boiling right now. Do the right thing."
relationship_advice,fna4b44,t1_fna337p,1586790762.0,"But his actions will FOREVER change your daughter. It’s almost like you’ve forgotten your daughter while trying to defend your husband. Put yourself in her shoes for just a moment and imagine you’re 15 and your father comes into your room while you’re doing something completely normal and natural and he FREAKS OUT. I’m pretty sure that would leave a damaging scar for at least a little while. But please continue to disregard this and focus on how people are replying about your poor husband.
Edit: grammar"
relationship_advice,fna3rc9,t1_fna0e8c,1586790459.0,"My goodness... get a grip on yourself. Your husband is NOT A GOOD PERSON. Stop defending him... what he did was wrong and if you didn’t agree you wouldn’t have posted on here. You came here for advice, you’re getting it... don’t deflect and act like this advice is not correct. You either need to step the heck up and stand up to your borderline abusive husband, or risk your daughter resenting BOTH of you for his actions. I would say good luck, but it doesn’t seem like you’re actually listening to any of the advice here. So instead I’ll say good luck for your poor daughter."

He’s been consistent with his beliefs, never had any rape allegation, have many instances where he’s fought for equality in race and many other areas. He’s the only one fighting against corrupt politicians who don’t have our best interest at heart and are bleeding us dry of resources and basic human rights. Sorry that you don’t think he’s great because he couldn’t get things passed. Pretty sure when it’s one against the masses, you can’t exactly force people to pass the issues that SHOULD be passed. I just don’t see how since he was fighting alone and didn’t get things through, that makes him a bad politician? He’s the ONLY ONE who has been consistent, wants the best for the people, and isn’t a total fucking narcissist... so yeah I don’t agree and don’t know what you want that could be better. At least he’s trying."

depression,flufu11,t3_fr46ks,1585501756.0,I have a hard time thinking life is real when I compare how different everyone’s lives are. When you’re younger you think that everyone does things the way your family does. As you get older you realize that no two families are the same. I’m now realizing that everyone has immensely different lives and things important to you are not important to them. Life is weird and it’s weirder when you’re dealing with a mental illness that makes you compare to everyone. It’s all SO WEIRD.

povertyfinance,fkfemw2,t3_fi1wa3,1584132716.0,"My mother works for the food services at my local school system. Our state just had a cyber seminar today about how the schooling system still needs to provide food for students, even if schools are not currently in session. She said that the schools will provide food at certain “drop offs” where students can come get the food. It’s not ideal, but they legally have to provide food for the children. It might be worth calling the school or posting online about it to see if your state or school district has something like this going on. I hope that everything works out for you and to say that your children are lucky to have someone like you who is actively trying to find ways to make things better for them."

PharmacySchool,fh9e688,t1_fh99ddw,1581379205.0,"If you’ve tried all of these steps, it might mean that when the alarms are going off, you are making a choice not to respond to them and continue as you usually do. I took a look at some of your older posts to see if maybe there was a hint as to why you couldn’t make changes even when something important is on the line. I saw some posts about mental health, and this can definitely hinder your ability to make changes to your behavior. As someone who suffers from anxiety and depression, I’ve almost been cursed to never be late due to my anxiety. For example this past APPE I had, I know how long it takes to get to my site, but my body still wakes me up earlier than necessary and I can’t relax until I leave, even if I’ll be 25 minutes early. 

I would recommend getting a non-phone alarm clock that you set to go off and maybe even put a note on it telling yourself to leave. Maybe you could also find someone in your class that will meet you in the hallway before important gatherings, so you might hold yourself more responsible know that you’ve made a meeting with a friend as well. Unfortunately it seems at this point you’ll need to try more than tips and tricks and focus on will power and sheer determination. I know how hard it is when you’ve got to worry about pharmacy school and your mental health. If you take the next week to really work on this and make a routine, it might lift a weight off of your shoulders and could help you a lot more than you know. 

You’ve got this!! Also, if you want to talk about any struggles or pharmacy related things, I might be able to help, or at least I’ll try."
PharmacySchool,fh98kns,t3_f1yfp8,1581375536.0,"Need some more info about what you’ve tried in the past? I don’t think I’ve ever been late to anything in my life unless it was an accident or something along those lines. I can give you tips about my day, I just wasn’t sure what you’ve already attempted. Unfortunately even outside of pharmacy, being late isn’t a great impression, so any improvement will probably be seen as a positive no matter how bad your reputation may be now."
