running,fnjozu8,t1_fnimjr4,1587003679.0,Same. And it really hit me after my first real injury that I couldn't just run slower or less miles. When I could not take a single running step I knew it was a necessity in my life when I fell apart emotionally. I become unpleasant to be around when I can't run. I never don't run because I don't want to. I only miss out on a run when my body physically can't. It was a hard lesson for me to learn because before that I took that running shit for granted. It's addicting to me and my mental health cure all. I am not me without running.
