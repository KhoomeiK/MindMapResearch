Pets,fpqz8d3,t3_gexjf6,1588836876.0,"I used their flea powder and it caused these big open sores on one of my kitties. Their topical stuff made my other kitten(at the time) drool uncontrollably for a good 12+ hours. He was so lethargic, barely able to stay awake (nodding off) and the drool just kept coming. It was scary to say the least. 
Now I stick strictly to Advantage. It's more expensive and harder to obtain, but it's worth it to keep em healthy.

I think he was lucky to make it through without vet access. I wish I could have taken him in as soon as possible however. I'm actually quite ashamed I didn't do more. Where I live the best we have for emergency pet clinics is an over the phone consultation. It's a very long drive to one.. I feel like it's a poor excuse, all of the ones I think of to make myself feel better are poor excuses. 

Don't let that poison take your kitty! Go to a vet asap!"
BPD,fp3u2j1,t3_gb0cte,1588285814.0,"It's ok to slip up, it's ok to break down. Don't give up! 
Tomorrow is a new day, just try again.

That fella you liked is just on a different journey, and that's ok too, even if it doesn't feel ok right now. 

It sounds like you have a lot on your plate as it is, make sure to take me time to process it all.. Penting all that up isn't good, for anyone. 
Writing stuff down, or sharing with a loved one might help. sharing your struggles with your struggling siblings could help otherways too. Hell, it could bring you guys closer together, or even encourage them to seek more help. 

Also, thank you, on behalf of everyone you're working so hard to help and protect. 

Take care of yourself ❤️"

Ouf.. Feeling responsible seems to hit the mark better than simple guilt.. Or they go hand in hand for me at least...
And yeah! We're trying, that's right! Go us, all of us! 
Thank you for your encouragement and for sharing :)"

BPD,fnge5md,t3_g1je5u,1586929484.0,"I'm right there with you for just about all that you've said, I'm definitely going through something similar.. 
My partner also has ADHD. If he's doing anything that takes his attention he completely ignores me... Or rather it just doesn't register. It's hard not taking this kind of stuff personally. It make me feel sad, frustrated and guilty..

It's definitely a challenge and it's sooo awkward to talk about.. Especially if said talk doesn't lead to any resolution.

I find the worst part, the part that makes me feel guilty, is that I know exactly how he feels. I've been so depressed that sex was the very last thing I wanted. I remember what it's like to feel pressured and the guilt of letting them down.. But yet I still find myself selfishly putting pressure on him. Gah! It's so difficult to not take it personally.. Which makes me feel more guilty! That pain I feel is also selfish, like I'm making his issues about me and that's so unfair.

BPD seems to make everything seem so much more complicated..
 
Umm yeah! So this was just me sharing that your not alone, not stealing the spot light.. Ugh I think guilt is what I struggle with most  :P"
Pets,fncuaw3,t3_g10avz,1586847448.0,Call an emergency vet right now for an over the phone consultation. They'd be a better person to ask and judge. If it happens again/on and off take a video to show your vet when you do get to see someone.
dbz,fmdhptl,t3_fu9l2o,1585968113.0,Amazing!! These are so good! Could I get the grid view for trunks? If I recreate it I can get Rolf to wear it and he'd look so cool! However! I understand if you don't want to xP

I did not know this was a thing... I had to look it up.. My heart is broken  :(
That's just cruel.. Left to suffocate and starve to death, while in constant terror from being carried around, dropped, squished and shaken... Not to mention being poisoned by whatever the dye in the water is.."

likeus,fkytb5u,t1_fkyowg2,1584655710.0,"I think taking flight was the right thing to do, they would have lost balance which would have lead to a real bad time. The nest looked rather secure, and the chicks stay pretty stationary. If their provider/caretaker were hurt to the point of not being able to hunt, none would survive.

 I'm no eagle behaviourist though!
So this is just an opinion, a guess really.

If it's never experienced a quake though I definitely understand wanting to nope the f out of there lol."

For me I think it's a combo of all the meds I'm on and the intrusive thoughts that come with whatever attention I get when I speak. I find the more the person is paying attention to me the more likely I'll be to draw a blank, even mid word. Like my insecurities shake the etch a sketch of my mind.
I have no idea if there's a proper term.
It sucks and is embarrassing.. I hate talking out loud."
BPD,fiymuo8,t3_fajf00,1582842540.0,"Every day... I try to tell myself I'm a kind person but that ends in me feeling sick about it.. Only terrible people call themselves nice things, cause they're self absorbed right?

BPD,fi637fn,t3_f6nvwk,1582177515.0,I find it easier to just avoid social media all together. When I want to talk to my fp I message them directly..

BPD,fggypv7,t3_eye8z4,1580772577.0,"I've done the STEPPS program!
I hate group activities, so it was quite difficult to go to each session. I'd cry the whole way to the meetings, every session..

It was validating to see and hear that I'm not alone.. You'll be told to do the homework.. It will help, at the very least you'll gain a better vocabulary to describe what you're feeling. 

Assuming your in Atlantic Canada you'll have a friends and family night. You don't have to go or take anyone.. I took my FP, an aunt who didn't believe in mental illness and my mom. It was horrifying! I cried through the whole night. They had explained BPD in a more comprehensive way for the normies(I say this with love lol) to understand and they taught them some things out of the STEPPS book. This was probably the most helpful part for me. It was so difficult to invite who I did, horrified they'd reject me.. It felt like I was shouting ""HEY LOOK AT MY MENTAL ILLNESS!! GIVE ME THAT STAGE LIGHT!! ""
I was rejected by one friend ""That sounds like a job for a boyfriend, we're not dating.."" -. - "" no shit Sherlock..
...
... I got a bit off topic..

T.l.d.r
I did the program, it helped a lot. Don't let anyone prevent you from getting any kind of help, it's toxic."
BPD,fggw6y6,t3_eyevnt,1580770924.0,"I definitely go through this. I can feel it building up day to day. 
A majority of the time I'll self trigger to release it all. Like listening to certain songs, watch certain movies or re-read dramatic events in my favorite web comic. It might not be the best thing to do.. It does however make me feel like I have some control over my emotions."

BPD,ffl2bzf,t1_ffkjb5n,1580033494.0,"I use it to cope too, everyday. The stigma makes me feel guilty and shameful about it, but I'd rather feel shame for fleeting moments than everything else constantly. It's like shaking an etch a sketch clean.

BPD,f8ydhws,t1_f8xawsf,1574945441.0,I grieved for 3+ days after watching a star is born. I was inconsolable. I know it's not real the real people are fine and I don't actually know them (the characters or actors) personally.. Knowing the reality of it didn't make it feel any less real.
AskReddit,f7ay9y8,t1_f7a42cx,1573545649.0,"Yup! Lived that through my school days. If I got below that perfect score I'd be scolded
""I'm so disappointed with you, I expected more"" .. 
A glare and the silent treatment always followed. I felt shame and self-hate every time I made below a perfect. One of my teachers told them about advanced classes and I was forced to take every one I possibly could. I just couldnt keep up the perfect grades. 
My anxiety became so high I would be physically sick and I was having panic attacks in class everyday... They just blamed bullying.. I tried to tell them otherwise.. I didn't have time to socialize or be bullied, I was always in the library or classroom studying, doing extra credit or get the jump on my homework. 
  I dropped out halfway through my third year, I was sick all the time. I tried going back for them.. I just couldn't, I had to take it somewhere really dark before they'd take me seriously. 

My self-esteem and self-worth never recovered. It's been 13 years and I still have nightmares most nights."
