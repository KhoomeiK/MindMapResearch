benzorecovery,fpy9ajj,t3_gg5ka6,1588998911.0,"I feel your pain. Know you aren't alone. I haven't been doing benzos as long as you have, but I remember the first week of my physical withdrawals, and let me tell you I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy. I slept maybe 6 hours that week. Shaking horribly. Throwing up blood. The works. Just know that it will pass. It sucks really bad, and I know suicide is something that crosses the mind often when you're at a point that low, but it will get better. Trust me. I'm not exactly at a good point myself at the moment, but I am clean from benzos and I'm grateful for that. The symptoms certainly haven't gone away fully and my memory and emotions are all over the place, but it only gets better. The brain has a incredible ability to repair itself from drugs believe it or not. Stay strong friend."
SuicideWatch,fpwroqf,t3_gfsv5a,1588968737.0,"Agreed!! The only reason I go is to vent and spill all the shit to someone who wont judge me. At least she says she doesnt judge me. Its fucked up tho. They say ""relax"" and ""do things you enjoy"". Like ok I literally cant relax I'm so restless all the time and I dont enjoy anything anymore. Even video games feel like a chore. Fucking annoying and the whole thing is so expensive. It's condescending to be sure."
coins,fppmx7k,t1_fpkz53c,1588805260.0,Wow those are some bargains!! Thanks for the advice. I'll have to check some out when society comes back. I've considered garage sales but never flea markets. Tho I've heard pawn shops can sometimes have some good stuff if they dont know what they have. That's less likely though since pawns shops like to make sure they're getting a profit lol.
replications,fpp8yt6,t1_fpp6u30,1588798014.0,Hahaha. Wow that's crazy it didn't get that intense for me. Either way yeah I'm having a much needed break. Plus I'm getting regularly drug tested now so it's not much of a choice lol.
replications,fpp63lg,t1_fpp55cc,1588796612.0,Oh I thought it lasted longer than that. I used to trip constantly and smoke tons while doing it so that makes sense. I need to give it a break though. Too much acid and dmt lol. Fucking stupid to be 19 and doing that much.

I'm more into the capped bust half dollars, which seem to be cheaper somehow. I feel like they're underrated honestly. Either way, if that makes em cheaper that's fine with me! Haha"
ketamine,fpk0ubf,t1_fpindra,1588685673.0,A little does go a long way. I did a line of 2fdck once that was the same normal size of a ket line I'd do. It put me on my ASS. I was like free falling in my bedroom and the visuals were super intense. Also a lot of audio distortion. It was not fun at all honestly.
depression_help,fpjotqv,t3_gdobbn,1588676365.0,Fuck em. Many girls actually MUCH prefer uncircumcised. It gives both people more pleasure. Circumcision is essentially the same as cutting of clutorises. So tell them that and also tell them they're fucking retarded. Lol

Like one guy told me how he says once he smokes weed ""well Im already doing drugs again so fuck it full speed ahead!!"". And he goes and does whatever his drug of choice is. And honestly I don't think gateway drugs exist. If you're gonna do them you're gonna do them. It's a complicated thing though. That's for sure."

I've met addicts who tell me they cant smoke weed because if they do they'll have a needle in their arm the next week. And that's real shit. Stop praising weed as a ""can do no harm"" type drug. What the fuck. I'm pro recreational legalization too, but seriously guys. Come on."

RationalPsychonaut,fp7b466,t3_gbjq55,1588367311.0,"If you're not ready then dont do it. It's that simple. I'm 19 and I honestly regret going so fast with psychedelics. I went from 1 tab and then immediately shrooms, high doses of ketamine, and dmt. Also other stuff like 2cb and research chems like 1p lsd and 4acodmt. Stuff like that. I am equally grateful and unhappy with what it did to me. Ultimately I think it will have made me a much much better person. But I have pretty severe depression and it led me to darker and darker places. I should've stopped. But I didnt and I cant take it back and that's ok. Just know your limits and dont abuse them. Also yeah steer away from r/psychonauts if you dont like all the nonsense they preach. This is a much better sub. That's my 2 cents anyways."

SuicideWatch,fp0txoj,t3_gah6hn,1588216842.0,I also really dont know how to feel when people are genuinely nice to me. It's not negative but more like indifferent. Probably since I'm so fucking numb nowadays. I can totally relate though. I've pretty much sat frozen still while everyone around me went sprinting off. Fuck.

My moms like wtf are you doing and why are you slurring your words. I also kinda fought my dad and worried the the hell out of everyone. Like fuck I'm retarded. I had a bag of 11 xans and 4 kpins.

benzodiazepines,fom404f,t1_fom2spu,1587877692.0,While I may not agree. I respect it. I have become much much more spiritual in the last 2 years I'd say. I mainly blame psychedelics and specifically dmt for that though. It complicated out there you know? But thank you. God can be an important figure in life. Even a devout atheist (I used to be one). I just have no many questions and about 99.999888% of them are... unanswered. Deep down though I think there might be something. Who the fuck knows tho haha. Peace and love man.
