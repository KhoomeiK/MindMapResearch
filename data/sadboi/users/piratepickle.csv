newfoundland,fdnxwam,t3_emcdt2,1578595081.0,Is this the Tim's on Topsail Road attached to the Esso?  I find this location especially bad.  One day I witnessed a person throw their cup out their window at the speaker.

Only con is they don't take appointments, they do what they can in a day."

Anxiety,f81gyrh,t3_dy6hb6,1574167043.0,"My parents were married 30 years before they went to a counsellor.

Throughout my childhood I knew they loved eachother but would have major fights (though, not physical or even yelling).  My dad was controlling but didn't realize it.  My mom felt like she couldn't go out with her friends or shopping for long because he would be home, growing bored and eventually angry.  

My dad also has a bit of a drinking problem - he's still in denial about that.  They'd fight about money.  They'd fight about spending too much with one side of the family or another.

The were at a low place and I had a heart to heart with my dad and suggested it.  Throughout it my Dad was (finally) diagnosed with anxiety and depression.  It was an ""Aha!"" moment for him.  He could see where his anger and other issues were stemming.  My mom was finally able to understand him and get the answers she was looking for.

After my dad was finally medicated and they finished therapy they have been a completely different couple!  They are so much more in love.  They understand each other.  They TALK out their problems and know the triggers.  It has a god-send.  They have the marriage they were supposed to have.  

All the luck to your and your wife.  keep your heart open."
newfoundland,f5whmno,t1_f5wdrg2,1572524195.0,"I am an alum of that Tim's. It was my first job when I worked there 13 years ago (holy crap).  A lot of the girls I worked with are still there and they have great management.  Management is very hands on and not just tucked away in the back.  It's like a family there. I made some of the best friends working there.

As I've gotten older it does sadden me to watch the Tim's brand just go down a hole.  They compete way too much with other fast food chains now.  I wish they just stuck with the coffee and donuts - I really think they would do well less options. But money is money I guess."
TrollXMoms,ewow2vw,t3_co1qv6,1565627977.0,"My parents took our kids the Thursday night, so myself and my husband played hooky from work on Friday lol  it's so much more fun as an adult.

We went to a cafe, an early movie at the theatre, got takeout and watched another movie at home and just snuggled in our bed. 

It was the best day - we really needed it :)"
newfoundland,evso8j3,t3_ckft03,1564752219.0,I asked a similar question a few days ago.  Feel free to have a [look] (https://www.reddit.com/r/newfoundland/comments/ci2t9j/looking_for_someone_who_can_do_custom_bumper/) :)
newfoundland,evkvsib,t3_ci2t9j,1564587109.0,"Thank you all for your suggestions last week.  Just wanted to send a little update in case anyone else finds it helpful.

I was recommended Decals Plus, Ltd. by my brother.  I reached out to them through Facebook and they were super responsive and within an hour they had my design and quote ready.  Very reasonable price as well 10 4x6 custom  vinyl decals for $25 and ready in one day.

Highly recommend!"
newfoundland,ev1kh31,t1_ev16xvz,1564160231.0,"Thank you :)  I'll put them on the list as well.

Do I need a professional to put the decal on if I get vinyl, or is that something I can do myself?"
newfoundland,ev1k321,t1_ev1dgio,1564160017.0,I was going to do the Vistaprint route (and still might).  I did get the design made by them.  But I also wanted to see what else was available :)
newfoundland,ev13kzv,t1_ev105jp,1564151666.0,Thank you!  I will look into what they offer.

toddlers,er548p1,t3_byyq3x,1560517648.0,"The whole not listening part because it makes my blood boil.
If I am at a store with my 3 YO and she just wanders off or hides in the clothing racks and will not listen to me, I can't handle it.

I refuse to be the parent that makes a bigger scene that her kids, but god damn, I get like 2 seconds away from dragging her out then she magically listens.

I think whats even more frustrating is that she'll say something extremely cute or hilarious shortly after.  Then I am a little mush puddle again.

Toddlers! I tell ya!"

newfoundland,eq2c80r,t1_eq282wc,1559733709.0,I felt the same when I lived in Edmonton hahaha I used to get annoyed on the days when it was beautiful out and I just wanted to stay at home and veg out.  I would feel so guilty!
newfoundland,eoccjkd,t3_br9fxo,1558456240.0,"Considering the amount of litter I see on a daily basis, we have no pride in our province at all.  The pretty TV ads are not a great representation of how much garbage flies around this place.  

I would just chalk it up to wind - but I have seen on numerous occassions people chucking garbage out their window... in a drive thru... with no shame.


On a positive note - I don't find our weather actually that bad.  Yeah, it can be rainy and windy but we don't have the catastrophic extremes seen in other parts of the world.  I like cooler temperatures, so maybe I am biased."
