UnsentLetters,fmm3mcf,t3_fw3672,1586198164.0,Hope you find comfort in knowing you're not alone. Don't feel ashamed for any of that. You've obviously learnt from that experiance and it's making you a better version of yourself. Let go of it when you're ready.
PS4,fmkzt30,t3_fvlspr,1586174553.0,This is very nice

blackmagic,flhc0fd,t1_flhbfpo,1585159862.0,"I cant find joy it's not been a month or so, it's been 2 whole years I've had lots of time to do things I like but the regret and guilt is killing me and I can't move forward in any sense. I can't stand it anymore and I know she'll never come back naturally so I'm giving up it's final. This was the last hope and I'd been putting it off in fears that you guys would be the same as everyone else. I don't have it in me whatever it takes to recover and move on, I only want her otherwise I don't want anything. I think death is the clear solution here. Because nothing can work unless I want it to right? I don't want to I'd rather end things permanently so I don't have to wake up with feeling like this forever or waste your time. I don't love myself because it's me who made her leave me I can never love myself ever again until she loves me might be stupid to you bit all the more reason to kill myself because I'm not like you normal people"
blackmagic,flhaxvv,t1_flham90,1585159303.0,I'm sorry I've been told everything I want what I want and nothing else. If I can't have life the way I want it then I don't want it at all and I think that's fair. You won't hear from me again don't worry.

I'm the person who's fucked up. I've tried to deter my way from death but it's the only option now. Everyday for the past 2 years has been torture thanks anyway
blackmagic,flh9qw6,t1_flh9c52,1585158686.0,I'm sorry but I think it's clear I must take my own life to get away from this I can't do any of those things you said there. There is no hope.

AnxietyDepression,flasva7,t1_flasa5c,1584990449.0,"Fair point, but I'm way past the point of the end. You can motivate me say whatever words to make me feel whatever I need to feel to want to live. After that I still have to do the work I still have of do things and I just don't feel like I want to. There is no drive in me. Nothing that's makes me push on. Fuck I don't want to even be here. I guess you're right this is all pointless and Ill take my post down. I wanted to see if there was anyone that could change my mind and there isn't. If you want to help you'd have to live my life for me and that's not possible therefore death is the answer."
AnxietyDepression,flasbez,t3_fno3px,1584990130.0,Look I know your having a hard time and feel like youre struggling and also you feel like you're being ignored. I can't relate at all to what you're feeling because I can't even get a job. I had a week to do a video interveiw and I couldn't get myself to do research on the company and practice. I couldn't even help myself. I'm sorry you're struggling and your anxiety is getting the better of you but go easy on yourself. The fact you have a job is sucj a big achievent in my eyes. I'm sorry if this doesn't help.
AnxietyDepression,flarxyh,t1_flaqyja,1584989912.0,"None of you are understanding you don't see my perspective. I don't want to do shit together. Fucking carry on living good for you. I'm not good at gaming I get shat on every single day. I don't have money I'm in a shit tonne of debt. My dad's getting old and he needs me to bring money in so I can't even fucking do what I want cus we're fucking poor. I can't get a job or even keep a shitty one because I don't want to be alive and blow my lid as soon as any inconvenience arises. Nothing I do to change will bring back what I want and that's a fact. Death is the only answer. You don't live in my body, you don't have to be me so you'll never fucking know what it's like. All you can do is say fluffy shit and that's it. Don't you see I don't want to change I don't want help my only option is death. There's one person that could change my mind and she's never coming back. Life is cruel for us who are weak and haven't had the loving childhood most of you cunts have. It takes time, I know, it's been 2 years going on 3 and nothing has made me feel like yh I want to carry on living I've lost 8kg of weight in a year and I was 64kg to start with. You don't know what it's like and even if you do you don't see it like I do. Life is worse than hell."

AnxietyDepression,flajwgq,t1_flaji2n,1584985337.0,"Na i don't see it like you do, I don't want to do anything you don't fucking get it, my reality will always be this and no matter how much I change it will never be what I want it to be because she'll never come back. Congratulations on finding a way to live. You wanting me to live means fuck all, I don't even know you, you don't even know me. They're empty words"
AnxietyDepression,flahx7s,t1_flah6fu,1584984218.0,"I've talked to too many helplines and too many people. There's nothing anyone can do. Been to the doctors tried the antidepressants I've done everything. Realise why I'm saying what I'm saying and where its coming from. It's not a rash decision it's endless suffering and it's just not fair anymore I'm not enjoying my life and can't change it. Didn't you read the title moron, it says I don't want to change meaning I don't want to work on myself. Wtf is you hoping going to do for me, nothing. I don't want to be an inspiration for nobody, I can never have the reality I want so I want out."

GetMotivated,fkx98ep,t1_fkx52r8,1584622595.0,"Don't you see why did they leave? Don't you think they tried? Ofcourse they did but just like my ex told me, I'm self destructive I've had the wrong upbringing and it was such a toxic environment but that's where I learnt everything nd that was my reality and truths. They all gave up on me because there's only so much people can do and you too will get there. No one can live my life for me and honestly that's what I need now because I don't want to live it but I have to support my family, my self esteem and confidence is straight non existent and my social anxiety is rediculously high. I can't live a normal life anymore man, I don't like change and this is so many big changes all at once. I'm everything you don't want in a person and that's why my ex left and didn't even second guess her decision, I pretty much left her no option. I feel sick just by writing all this to you, I hate myself and I hate the world I wish everyone could understand and feel my pain but it doesn't matter how I feel does it? People only care when you try, or when youre fighting. People hate listening about your depression, they say it's exhausting and just adds to the list of insecurities. I never imagined I'd be here at 24 and I know now I don't have any discipline or control over myself, if I carry on living I'm going to make it worse and honestly I can't imagine what is worse than wanting to die. Thanks for your kindness but there isn't really anything anyone can do, don't you see 8f I don't dk anything your energy and kindness is wasted. I'm cursed I'm being punished for fuck knows what but I can't help myself. Motivational quotes and speeches just make me realise how isolated I am to normal society. I'm weak and don't say its okay to be weak once in a while. I've always been weak always I'm a coward and no one wants to be around a coward, I just hate everything about myself and I'm unable to change any of it. I'm stuck in the past and can't see a future, because the one person I want in it, will never be there."
GetMotivated,fkx86k9,t1_fkx52r8,1584621753.0,"I did ring my uni up last year and told them, they just said sorry uni policy states you have one shot at the final year of your degree, no one gets a resit. They also said we couldn't put you in because the modules I did don't exist and they don't have the same syllabus so if have to do 3 years of uni again and I can't afford that at all, that's £27000 out of my pocket and that's just tuition. I have been just waking up and it isn't enough, my dad keeps telling me how badly he's struggling with bills, how he wants to go meet my grandma back in India because she's on her deathbed and he can't because we'll lose our house if we don't pay the mortgage. All I want is my ex back just so I can stay grounded and just stop worrying and feeling so shitty about myself. I didn't end up in this place on accident, I got myself hear and I'm responsible for all this but just can't accept it. Everyday I'm running away from my problems because I don't want anything, in my mind my life stopped when my ex left and it will only resume if she's back until then I'm not living I'm just awake and  breathing."
GetMotivated,fkx0buz,t1_fkuuz5u,1584613787.0,"Everything you're saying is exhausting, none of them fix my problems. It's been too long man, I'm practically dead anyway. Been stuck at home for two years no motivation or want to find a job, no want to get better, no want to live in spite, no want to prove my ex wrong. Want is the first step then there's doing, I just can't get anything done because living in this reality is a chore and I'm being forced to live this when I don't want to at all. The people I thought cared gone now, the women I wanted to spend the rest of my life with is gone and its all my fault, my hopes of getting a degree and making all that debt worth it gone, I had 2 exams between me and my degree and I couldn't sit them because of how depressed I was. Now I'm just afraid of everything even just trying, I'd rather reject something than risk getting rejected, I've not passed a single phone interveiw so I can make it to a face to face. I'm the problem and I feel like I'm cursed. Nobody is fighting for me, those friends wouldnt have watched me sink my ship like it did, any advice they have for me now is irrelevant, they don't care and they never did, they wernt friends, they just used me and now I don't have anything to give them. I want to hear your words from one person and one person only, but guess what that's too much to ask for now. From good morning and goodnight, it's been silent for 2 years, can't share any happiness, no vulnerability, no reassurance, no celebrations, no hope, no future to look forward to just silence. The worst thing is its all or mostly my fault, if I kept myself in check and respected myself I would've never been left to fall down this hole. I cabt get out now all I can do is keep digging, living is hell my friend and not worth it for me anymore. Im not living for myself anymore and I don't belong here with all you people, I'm so different in a bad way. I ruined my whole life because I can't get back up and we're all adults now so no one has the time, everyone has responsibilities and prioritises them. That's the mistake I made and I'll pay for it till I die, I wish I had different parents raise me because its too late now way too late I want it all to just stop."

There is no one that can help, nobody can live my life for me, I can't stay focused or do the hard work I've given up, just like everyone else who gave up on me, or I made them give up on me.

spirituality,fks589l,t1_fks1j61,1584482536.0,"My life has gone downhill since 2018 and Im convinced suicide will solve my problems. The people from my religion seriously deter me too, religion is a competition and a way for them to have an identity completely disregarding anything else their own creator has created. He's been seeing be struggle for years and I just don't feel his precence at all in my life. My mother prays all the time yet her life has been shit and fukknof suffering. My mother suffers from mental illness but no one has ever tried to get her help they've just let her have her outbursts and I've also got the same issues. I'm ill equipped for life in general why would god create me to feel worthless and inferior to everyone, why would he keep me alive full of hatred and bitterness towards those who are happy. I have so many issues so many and I know the higher power has the capabilities of taking them away even just shift my perspective, but maybe he thinks I don't deserve it because I don't have blind faith as my religions suggests. That's where my stubbornness comes in, I will run my life to death because I hate what has become of life and what has become of me. Either it's all my fault and I'd rather die or God is punishing me which Is also another reason to die. If I end up dying my ex who I deeply deeply want back won't have the last memory of me being a shit bf, my friends who left me because I was suicidal and deeply depressed will regret what they did. I'll leave a bigger impact on people after I die than I am being alive. Rn I'm the guy who no one cares about anymore because I can't even help myself anymore. I just don't like the fact I have to pray and have blind faith and zero certainty about anything. Never know if my prayers are bing heard etc. Honestly I wish I wasn't born, I want nothing more than eternal sleep, non existent, no conscious, no mistakes, no success, no feelings, no emotions, no hurdles, no life, no love, no evil just blackness and zero thoughts. I believe he is there but hes written my story this way so it's kinda fucked up he'd want me to live this life (this is what my religion teaches) there is no free will, God knows everything you're going to do etc. Sorry for the long message but I'm just at a different place in life, zero hope, zero faith and no motivation or drive to make a better life, I'm a quitter not a fighter."

Fine but it's these people who suddenly try to re enter your life when you start faking that you're feeling good. Imo I do get drained by some of my friends talking depressing shit but I love them and want them to feel better, me listening to them could be the little breakthrough and support they need. I had friends who would book appointments for me because of the state I was in and I would've never improved and probably killed myself if they didn't man I respect and appreciate them all and try my best to repay them in anyway possible.

In my lowest of lowest days it wasn't just depression it was underlying undiagnosed problems that was making things so difficult. I didn't want help I was suicidal and wanted to end things. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for my friends helping me take those first few steps."

MMFB,fjgfjb8,t3_fdb0kq,1583325022.0,"Give yourself more time, breakups arent easy and don't compare your healing and recovery to someone else. I'm 18 months in not fully healed but I'm a numpty and act on impulses easily and made some huge mistakes when I was 7 months in. You may feel lost and out of control but you will over time get stronger mentally and be able to shake off those thoughts, they will dilute themselves as time goes on. That's the third hardest thing waiting for time to pass by till those memories are buried in the past. Try your best to not put everything on hold and shut down, I'm paying the price for that now and its only made me depressed even more. Do whatever you can to make yourself feel confident, happy and proud of yourself. I'm so sorry that you're having to go through this huge adjustment I understand exactly how difficult it is, even though times feel really tough I promise you won't feel like this forever, relationships aren't easy in anyway, they just don't work out. Doesn't matter about blame or who was right or wrong, the team wasn't functioning and that's all that matters and it's okay! I've driven myself crazy by overthinking so yh don't torture yourself with overthinking aswel. Time is moving forward wether we like it or not, we must move with it or stay behind."

unpopularopinion,fjcvtaa,t1_fjcv888,1583238465.0,"Badly man it made me insecure af, I know now I shouldve been more comforting, but that's the beauty of looking back. It triggered my mental illness and I got super depressed for a while. I did manage to get over it but it took me months, she kept telling me to get over it like it wasn't a big deal. Our relationship would've been so different if she'd given me a choice. I'm that guy tho who is late to everything, doesn't realise until its too late. I just wasn't the same, my mental illness and depression took over and she couldn't handle it and left me 2 years ago. I'm even more insecure now and kinda want to end my life. Miss her loads everyday and hope I get 1 more chance in the future because I was young man she was 2 years older than me. Everything was going so well and she threw a spanner in the works."

Then had to cough up money for a root canal. I brush twice a day now lol"
