BreakUps,fhifwh1,t3_f3f3u4,1581623955.0,"1. We met at a **LARP**. I didn't noticed him at first, but he did something funny and I sent him a friend request and he started texting me really quickly.
2. He's a very smart guy, very affectionate and attentive, charming and works a lot. He is honest, stable financially and works on himself.
3. He was doing some *speed dating* when we were only chatting. I didn't know if I was interested yet, but I told him I wasn't interested in being stuck in ""*you are texting my boyfriend???*"" type of situation. So he panicked and still wanted to keep in contact. He also said he didn't want any problems (*duh. and everyone has problems*). His room is a mess and some people don't like talking to him too much, because he tends to be a bit direct ( I am also direct, but I am not too crude, so idk). He had a few ""*one nights*"", but he told me he was past this phase and he wanted his next relationship to last. I left him the benefit of doubt on that, he always seemed genuine and sincere.
4. I suffer from depression, anxiety, suicidal tendencies and **PTSD,** due to lots of problems and abuse from a previous relationship 4 years ago. And when I met him I was stable. But, I changed my meds at the end and had a panic attack that scared him and he got away.
5. The breakup was horrible. He felt guilty and I told him he made me happy, to not worry about that.  I told him I still loved him and would take him back (at the beginning) but since he told me he didn't want to, I was okay. All I wanted was to not have any fights, but he ended up putting the blame all on me, which only worsened my mental health. I went NC, then I saw him again, he tried to regain my trust, I told him I was unsure, and he got angry. He then got jealous of my other male friends and then he ended up insulting me (again) and I blocked him.
6. I have learned that you should write down your feelings. Sometimes your friends get tired of your stories and trying to talk it out. Even your best friend (I told her it was hurting me, and it was a reason why I don't really seek her help anymore). She has been more comprehensive, but I will still keep my thoughts to myself for a certain time.
7. A failed relationship is always coming from **both** parties, *unless it involves cheating and abuse*. It's the mature way to do. But if you only put the blame on the other, you have something to figure out in your emotions. On my side, I need to work on my depression (again), him on his coping mechanism.
8. He was a great boyfriend, but a horrible ex. I still have a place for him in my heart, but I do not have to put effort on him anymore. If life throws him back in my way, I only wish for it to be the best, boyfriend or not, if life doesn't, it means it wasn't meant to be. I do not deserve to be treated that way, and never will. No one does."

Not all people are the same. My ex was a pretty logic guy, and he went from a very loving man to very angry afterwards. Anger is still an emotion.
I think that the thing with men is mostly that you guys supress your emotions, since it’s not considered socially acceptable to « have » feelings for you guys. The truth is, unless you are a psychopath or a sociopath, you are most likely to have emotions. Being in touch with them is more difficult. 
Yes, us women tend to be « more emotional » but, that’s because our female social circle allows us to be. And that’s why most men confide in women. 
I find it very hard for you guys, since accepting your emotions will make it sometimes easier for you to move forward. The downfall for you guys after a certain time following a breakup, from what I heard from my male friend is very very hard.

What I tell most people who want to help those in depression, is to say this to them: I know you are struggling and that you feel stressed at the moment, and I know it’s your depression talking, but I choose to be by your side. I choose to be there for you, and you can’t take that choice and that right from me.

After 6 months, my best friend contacted me and apologized. It took a bit of time for me to trust her again, but she showed me that she won’t do it again.
Moral of the story: if you respect yourself enough, you won’t allow this to happen. If they respect you, they will see what they did wrong to you and grow up and apologize. It hurts, but eventually you grow out of it and learn from it."

And if so, sociopathy develops itself through trauma and it shuts down the emotional part of the brain. 
The best solution in your case would be to learn to control and feel your emotions without them taking over you. Turning towards the « feeling nothing » would make you only more edgier and make you pretend something you are not, or don’t want to become, instead of being patient towards yourself and better yourself with the appropriate treatment.
Sorry if my words sound too harsh, I only want to help, but antisocial behaviour shouldn’t be a solution in avoiding your emotions. It only causes more pain. If you have any more questions, you can DM me :)"

depression,fe6lavs,t3_enzmg5,1578894701.0,"Hi!
I’ve been suffering from insomnia a lot as well during my depression.
I’ve tried many things: Sleeping pills, taking air, listening to relaxing music, relaxing sounds, or hypnosis too. There are also breathing techniques that release stress from the body, making you feel less stressed for 4 hours. 
Doing some exercises prior sleep helps too.
Reading a good book as well."

Do NOT belittle him.
Read about depression and ask him how you can help him."

depression,fe6k6nt,t3_enwzxa,1578893580.0,"I’ve had moments like this as well. And I agree they are horrible.
I had to be careful, because I was like a cooking time bomb. But, I think your age plays a part in this too. You should see the school councelor or any therapist."
depression,fe6jveh,t3_enzdt8,1578893275.0,Respect for those as well!
depression,fe6jpy9,t3_enxqyo,1578893128.0,"I know where you have been. It was a harsh place for me too and the Catholic Church. It’s believed that suicide is a sin, since it’s your life, a life of a children of God that is taken.
The Catholic Church is not at the same place as psychology of today, and your depression is nothing to be ashamed of.
Your father and your priest tried to help you in their very little means, it’s nothing against you.
Instead, seek therapy or help from a professional.
Explain clearly to your father how you have been. If he loves you, he will try to help you.
I know how it is. Been there with my mum. It was hard at first, but she is heartbroken everytime she sees me depressed. And she started reading about how she could help me, instead of relying on the Church. 
I hope the same for you!"
depression,fe6j9k9,t3_enyrjc,1578892688.0,"And you were brave enough to do this post :) it’s already a step, keep up!"
depression,fe6j1ve,t3_enx9k7,1578892482.0,"I’ve had this for a while as well.
Sometimes, it hurt people I love. But, I couldn’t always control this anger, so whenever I felt an intense emotion, I would write it down. So that it gives me time to rationalize and calm down when I write.
But, sometimes, when I was too depressed, I wouldn’t do it, still scared to hurt people, so I would turn this anger towards myself.
Not a very good thing either.
The best way to do so, it’s keep on writing how you feel, could it be here, or on a piece of paper and then make a ball out of.
Therapy has been helping me a lot on trying to control this.  Meds either make me feel numb or super intense in it."
