They aren’t haunting, but visiting to make us feel better. For us to not feel so alone, for us to realize they are happy in spirit and here for us. 
It took me a while to get to that point tho, at first I thought it was muscle memory thinking I could feel a cat jump on the bed, walk over and plop on my legs, or hear her walking down the hall. Then it did feel haunting, because her death was traumatic and thought she should be mad. Then I learned from someone trusted and and devoted what it all really means."
