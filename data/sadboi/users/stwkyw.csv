I know real-world code is usually straightforward and doesn't have to be elegant-- it just has to work in an efficient way.

However, I do find certain programming games help with problem solving methodology and taking the time to debug a puzzle. And it's nice to give your mind a break from work with something a little more enjoyable but somewhat educational."

I focused on learning everything I could and doing my work well. I tried to take every opportunity to learn. 

I know networking is extremely important. Cultivating work relationships was [and is] a struggle. I look young, so a lot of people treated me as if I was an intern. Eventually, my coworkers and I became friends. It got better and it became a consistent routine, so my anxiety lessened. I would be remiss if I said I don't regret starting my job promptly after graduating. I felt pressured to have a job lined up after graduation.
