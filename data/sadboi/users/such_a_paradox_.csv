Mi viejo está acostumbrado a tomar vino todos los días, así que el ya estaba equipado y de vez en cuando me ofrece un poco. Creo que me va bastante bien la verdad."
Allergies,fmxyt1e,t3_fxvgbl,1586474570.0,"It did happen to me for a few weeks but it was a really light sore throat - so light it happened some days, not everyday. It started after getting my weekly immunotherapy shot a day late cause I fell asleep when I had to have it,  and then I remembered I hadn't  done my nasal rinse for a while either. After some weeks (and  being scared of having covid-19 but no other symptom but the light sore throat) it went away.

I was scared because everytime I went into google there was no ""sore throat"" as an allergy symptom lol."

I had a phase where I thought maybe college isn’t for me, so I dropped out - but it’s so hard getting a job without a degree and I actually do want a degree!! 

After 8 years of struggling with college I got diagnosed and started treatment. Now I’m being more capable of doing my homework and studying. I’m finally done with the first year of my career!"
