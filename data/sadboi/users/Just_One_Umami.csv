When I laughed and said he almost certainly didn’t, because a foot is longer than my entire forearm and up into my palm (when arm is bent at 90 degrees). She wouldn’t believe me. She kept _insisting_ his dick was a full 12 inches. I grabbed a ruler and watched the life drain from her eyes as I busted up laughing. She said it was more like 5-6. 

Needless to say, dudes obviously lie about their dick size to their partners, and women suck at guessing size, so they just believe what they’re told."

1. The hospital wouldn’t even test me 

2: I couldn’t afford treatment if they did

I was pretty anxious for over a week. Fucking sucked. Physically worst two weeks of my life. I haven’t been sick like that since I was a toddler, and that was a combination of a gnarly flu and heat stroke, which only lasted for a couple days. 
I’m just glad this thing didn’t kill me. That funeral debt alone is enough without treatment."
