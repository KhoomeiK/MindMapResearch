They warned me it would be strong, but I had no clue. Spit immediately comes pouring out the side of my mouth and my lips/jaw are literally too numb to close. The lightheadedness hits me like a brick shit house so my head just swings back as I lay on the bed trying to process how inconceivably high I am.

I confront him first thing in the morning and he gas lights me and tells me it’s my fault. He says I deserved all of it because I haven’t gotten a job yet. He doesn’t take back any of the awful things he said the night prior, only doubles down and says maybe it was my fault. I admit I’m not looking for anything crazy just basic fucking human respect and decency but that’s too crazy of a concept for him to handle I guess. He went on to say how I, like most millennials, are just looking for free handouts, and I explained no I’m just looking for the most bare human respect that anybody deserves regardless, but he wasn’t listening to reason. And the real kicker is that when I returned home I found my PlayStation flung on the ground and now it won’t eject or read discs so that’s great. Goes to show who the real kid is"
