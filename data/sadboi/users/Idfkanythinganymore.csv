It depends for the individual on whether it gets worse or better over time, but it usually gets better. Be patient and understanding with her when she tics, and don't always point it out when she does. You should take her to her normal doctor/pediatrician and talk about it with them. Depending on what they see, they might have you call a neurologist (which would ask you questions about the tics in the past and present, and possibly diaganose her)."

Animals. Eating your favorite meal. Laying in bed and sinking into the mattress after a long day. Jamming to your favorite song. Seeing a pretty painting. Your favorite holiday. The smell of really awesome scented candles. Hearing someone's laughter. Seeing someone smile. Sitting by the fireplace and having a mug of hot coco when it's freezing out. And if it's always warm where you are, then going to the pool and dipping your toes in the cold water. A refreshing drink. Seeing someone's first piece of artwork. Hearing someone speak passionately about something they love with all of their heart. Sunsets and sun rises. Stupid video games that you can't help but love. Curling up with a warm, big, fuzzy blanket. The sound of a fan or the ac on a summer night. Cute stuffed animals. Chocolate. You gotta love for chocolate man. Watching your favorite TV show or movie. Walking down the street and seeing that one really attractive person. The sound of the ocean. Seashells. Coins.  Any friends or family you may have that you care about. If you have none, I'm your friend now. Seeing a baby giggle and smile. Reading a damn good book. The smell of old books. The smell of a new car. Growing up. Getting your dream job. Achieving things you thought you would never be able to. Taking long walks in the park. The beautiful colors of flowers. Bees and their adorable little selves. Snowflakes dancing in the air. Seeing yourself in the mirror and thinking ""damn, I look good."" even if it's only for a second. The way shampooing your hair feels. And then washing it all off afterwards. Fuzzy pj's, socks, and slippers. Cute coffee mugs that a mom would 100% own, but you bought it anyways because it made you smile. Your favorite actor or actress. Your favorite band or singer. Your favorite book, think about what it would be like to never read it again. To never hold those pages with words that cleanse your soul ever again. Live for the first rain drops in spring. And when the leaves change and fall in Autumn. The snowflakes in winter and the flowers in summer. Live so you can learn that language you always wanted to know, but never got around to learning. Or to make that meal you always thought looked really good. Live for fresh cups of coffee, warm cups of tea, hell, even a lemonade. Maybe it's even the cheap lemonade too, the packet kind, but you no longer care because why should you? It's delicious. Live for everything that's ever made you smile. Everything that's ever made you cry. That's made you get angry. That's made you feel. Live for the stars, the moon, and the sun. You, you incredible person are made of so much. You are made with the love of the universe, and you are so amazing. Lastly, live to get better. Live to smile again. Live for yourself. Because you're fucking worth it."
