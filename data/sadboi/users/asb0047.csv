It shows the brutal thought control and how that compelled neighbors to do this, the power of hatred, and scapegoats. Rwandan women are proud and educated, their government has huge women representation, and some of their prominent politicians at the time of the genocide were powerful moderate women, they were murdered, and the memorial notes this. It shows the timeline of how things got worse, and people were indoctrinated or conditioned to a new norm. And with the plane crash, people were angry, it sparked a massacre of the minority. In some ways, I unfortunately see this every time racial tensions flare up. The rest of the museum is dedicated to the stories genocides throughout history. Including the Holocaust, the native Americans, etc. Brutal, but speaking to children of survivors and survivors theme selves gives you hope as well. The government is trying, education is now available for all, which is huge, people love that. I spent time at a church there and saw how they embraced a spirit of Christianity I admired far more than that I’ve seen in America. The community was so powerfully together in creating a better future. I learned they’re just as deserving as everyone else. And how easy it is for hard work to not correlate with success. These people work far harder than I, yet I have access to more resources. So I think what do I have to do? I think it starts with listening to others struggles, and learning as best I can from reading, taking advantage of my advanced education to create a better system or international norm, or even just paying attention to the people in my society that have been denied access to the fruits of our republic here.

I think it is absolutely criminal and honestly heinous that parents can pull children entirely out of exposure to the outside world and impose their views on them. It’s brainwashing. Children should have to go to public school so THEY get the opportunity to decide for themselves their interests. In and ideal world homeschool parents would allow their children to explore their interests. 

Idk about in the UK, but in the US it is usually to keep them from exposure to outside groups. And frankly, that by itself is wrong. Iterated experiences with different cultures and perspectives create healthier relationships. It’s much harder to be homophobic when your best friend comes out of the closet. 

Homeschool here is how you get children and family’s trapped in situations where the kids are quite literally gang raped by pastors at a young age and traded around. 

I suppose fundamentally I view the children as unique individuals whose parents may not necessarily have their best interests at heart. Because I view them as individual citizens, I think they have the right to an academically curated liberal (diverse, not political) education so that they can make choices for themselves. 

Additionally, parents would still get to take them to church and sporting events, but giving parents total control over their children’s lives is not treating them as people in a society, it’s treating them as property."

As for your friends, sometimes they really just don’t know how to respond. They haven’t been through it. They aren’t equipped with the tools to help you. When someone says you should see a therapist about this, it’s because they do care about you. What they then also do later is important. 

Because my therapy is great but the reality of it is some days still fucking suck. Make sure your friend understands that you don’t expect them to have all the answers. You might just want someone to share with, or something to do. 

Don’t make a habit of it, try to stand on your own, but on the bad days. Try to forgive yourself, all of these are lessons I’m still trying to learn as well.

ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,ez7fxla,t1_ez6w00c,1567723172.0,"Of course not. But I think your misunderstanding my point on government. If any kind of region is going to be stable it needs a monopoly of power within the region, without that we don’t get things like property rights, municipales, and the few rights workers have left. These things wouldn’t happen in a less regulated economy because, as even Adam Smith said:  “the rate of profit does not, like rent and wages, rise with the prosperity, and fall with the declension of the society. On the contrary, it is naturally low in rich, and high in poor countries”. Countries with a high increase of profit rate are heading the fastest to ruin. Yet that’s a a common metric. 

I suggest reading this https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/adam-smith-and-inequality/, it’s a pretty good deconstruction of his work, and while I don’t agree with everything, his version of capitalism predicts the kind of shit were seeing now with wealth accumulation.

ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,ez6p5al,t1_ez6b5ix,1567714174.0,"Your last sentence is literally what the “far left” in American politics advocates for. Humanitarian regulation that says everyone has a place in society. Sanders, for example, is democratic socialist. Most things are still in the private sphere. 

Now as for government inefficiency that’s just propaganda. Medicare is one of the most efficient forms of insurance possible. And as for big government. Government is how a society functions, as a society grows, it needs a larger governing body to meet its demands. 

To me the ideal government is one that restricts the worst aspects of human nature and encourages the best, with respect to our current understanding. Examples of this concept applied, corporations exist solely to make money, that is there primary motivation. So an incentive to get them to treat workers better could be to bind the highest paid employees salary with that of the lowest. If CEO wants more money, everyone gets a proportional raise. An incentive to vote could be, 20 dollars or the equivalent of, maybe local restaurants can contract with the cities to cater voting sites. 

There will always be conflict, but the beauty of government is it as an institution can be about more than just profit, it CAN be about us. It just needs to be adapted to temper itself from our worst natures, bribery, reelection campaigns, the societal disconnect we have. Instead of overspending on the military we want to ludicrously over spend on education and renewable energy. Individualism sure sounds righteous until it’s your house burning. (Not to say everyone should do, think, or feel the same, just that there is a baseline of humanity that can underpine a community.

CEO’s used to only make 60x there lowest paid employee. Now it’s something like 600x. IMO an easy solution to this is to say CEO’s can only earn up to 100x of lowest paid employee. Still tons of money. More than anyone needs."

I haven’t listened to it myself, I completed Worm before I knew about the subreddit, audiobook, or podcast haha. But the work is definitely worth reading. The characters are nuanced and the powers are captivating. 

And the sequel is currently being written right now :D"
WritingPrompts,ew69dvz,t1_ew68c7u,1565158909.0,Worm is the best web serial by far. There’s even a fan created audio book version!
