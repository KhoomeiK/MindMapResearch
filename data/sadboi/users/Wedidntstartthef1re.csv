He eventually gave in. Made it to the 5th mile, slipped and tore his cruciate ligament.

He couldn't work so stayed at home with his wife, he started arguing with her a lot. So much they decided to separate and get divorced.

He moved out, his adult children hated him and he rented a house from a mutual friend.

A few months later our mutual friend calls me to let me know that 50s guy had poorly screenshotted mutual friends photos from facebook and used them as his own on tinder. All well and got except he was a 5'2, 50 year old latino guy. Mutual friend was 6 foot 30 year old white guy.

Usually my mutual friend wouldnt be that bothered, except he found out from his wife as one of her friends saw his photo on tinder, but with latino guys name instead. They were also about to get married so both were really angry. 

Mutual friend tried to ring latino guy. Latino guy hung up when he realised he was busted. Long story short my mutual friend evicted him.


Yeah
