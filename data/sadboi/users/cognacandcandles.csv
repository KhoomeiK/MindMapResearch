I am not sure what country you are living in and I can accept that there may be some cultural differences (which you have alluded to) regarding her dress and mannerisms. However, this clearly is not about that. I think your housemates are correct: You are jealous of this woman.

Because you are jealous of this woman, you seem to be searching for reasons not to like her and lashing out at her in inappropriate ways. You need to leave her alone. The way her body looks, her nipples, her dress, her language, and her accent are none of your concern. Asking her to change her clothes and constantly staring at her body is out of line. 

I am sensing that you have some significant issues with your self esteem that is fueling this resentment. Perhaps this young woman reminds you of the things you don't like about yourself. That can be distressing, upsetting, and make a person feel angry and bitter. It has got to be exhausting to feel that way. I strongly encourage that you do some self-reflection and find some activities that nurtures self-care and self-love. It may be beneficial to seek out some mental health services to help you work through these issues."

If she had a phobia of eyeballs, you wouldn't ask her to put your eyedrops in for you. You have explained you have a phobia and have even tried to give her a footrub that, you say, was unsuccessful. But you tried nonetheless! I think that says a lot. 

That being said, if you find this phobia distressing. If you feel that it is significant enough that it impairs your functioning - for example, summer time sends you into anxiety attacks because you are worried about looking at everyone's feet in sandals - then I encourage you to see a therapist. Or if you want to work through it via therapy, seek one out. 

Talk to your wife when things have cooled down. Tell her that your love for her is not directly related to your willingness to give her footrubs. Maybe get her one of those foot massager machines or compromise with a back massage to help satisfy her needs and meet your concern of not having to give footrubs."

I can understand that you want your son to have a good birthday party. I can understand that you feel inviting a child with challenging behaviors could open the possibility for a situation that, in your view, could affect the mood of your son's party. I would even say that's a reasonable conclusion and this does not make you TA. 

Not inviting him because of this does make YTA. A 10-year-old boy who is high functioning autistic will, certainly, have a history of misbehavior. The birthday party he attended last year may have been the first birthday party he ever attended. He may not have the cognitive flexibility to recognize that you only open birthday presents on your own birthday, not someone else's. He didn't have the emotional regulation skills to control his response to that confusion. He didn't have the social thinking skills to understand how others will perceive that behavior. But no one can change the past. 

Those are teachable moments for the caretakers of those with autism. They are inevitable but can be used as stepping stones to help people like David behave more appropriately. As someone who has stated that David's mother appears do be doing her best, don't you think that she may put in effort to help David behave better at birthday parties? Just like you want your son to have a good birthday party, she probably wants her son to be able to make friends so that he can have his own birthday parties. She works hard to help her son. Like my mother, she has probably spent hours researching different interventions and missed work to take him to specialists. She has probably swallowed her frustrations and embarrassment over his public meltdowns, maintained her patience until it dangled by a thread, and lost sleep worrying about his future. The exclusion hurts her just as badly as it will hurt him.

People with autism get excluded all the time. My brother certainly did. They may have difficulty with social skills. They can be hard to manage sometimes. But they can learn and grow just like everyone else. They also feel the pain of being excluded just like everyone else. And I can promise you, that will be more damaging for him than a meltdown at his 10th birthday party would be for your son. 

Please call David's mother, apologize, and invite David. You probably aren't the first to exclude David and you definately won't be the last. But you can be one of those people who make David feel normal and give his mother some comfort."

I find some of those sources to be credible but you can make your own decision. 

With that being said, this has not been CONFIRMED to be true here in Memphis. I called my vet immediately when I saw this and she was not aware of the issue. Shelby farms has addressed the issue other places have had with this algae and made a statement (on their Instagram on August 13th) that they are regularly testing the water. At that time (August 13th), the water did not have any of the concerning algae. That being said, it is probably best to err on the side of caution until this gets sorted out.

No expections. That's non-negotiable. Do you know why? Because that is a CHILD! Let's stop for a second and remember what a child is: a human being that is completely dependent on a guardian for their care, needs, and wellbeing. Don't ask or expect your spouse to put your needs above the needs of their child. An adult having a temper tantrum because their spouse's attention is being diverted more toward their child is ridiculous. You're an adult. Just talk to your spouse - you know like adults do - about spending more time together during their free time. If that is such a problem, then you ought not marry a person with kids.
