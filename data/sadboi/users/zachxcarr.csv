BPD,f4qvryi,t3_dljg2h,1571758934.0,"You are not the only person who feels that way here I promise you buddy. It actually has a term for it! It‚Äôs called splitting, and it‚Äôs a very defining symptom of BPD. It‚Äôs essentially having a FP(favorite person) or anyone else really, going from a state of value and admiration in your brain to almost immediately switching to devaluation and almost disgust in a very short amount of time. Usually from a perceived slight, whether it be from a change in tone, change of plans, perceived or real abandonment, etc.. at least from my experience. You aren‚Äôt a bad person, these emotions are extremely hard to control. And I‚Äôm proud of you for reaching out. Splitting is essentially caused by black and white thinking, meaning it‚Äôs very hard for people with bpd to understand a grey area of life. Meaning it‚Äôs sometimes hard to understand that people are both good and bad at the same time. Everyone has good and bad traits. What your brain is doing when splitting is a defense mechanism, we have an intense fear of abandonment so when pour brain perceives that to be happening or could happen in any way, we often split on someone to defend ourselves. This is obviously not the best or rational course of action in situations but it is usually our first response. I hope that maybe just by knowing what‚Äôs going on you can find a semblance of peace within it my guy."
BPD,f4qtx5l,t3_dljhu1,1571758232.0,"No judgment at all, I find myself splitting on my gf‚Äôs dog a lot. Very odd, I guess I had never experienced it because I didn‚Äôt grow up with pets. But yeah, you‚Äôre def not the only one who feels that way."
BPD,f4qtgpt,t1_f4qsepp,1571758062.0,"Yeah I definitely see where you‚Äôre coming from and what your saying. Putting it in that perspective helps. It‚Äôs almost addicting if that‚Äôs the right word to use, I have been so adamant about this in life to points where I have made my friends even my mom burst out in tears. :/ I should be asking myself those questions before I start off on some crazy tangent. I guess it goes back to doing what is effective rather than specifically what I feel is right. I really appreciate the kind words and support. Thank you for that."
