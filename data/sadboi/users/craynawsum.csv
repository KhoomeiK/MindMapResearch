depression,f9j5j66,t3_e5by8g,1575357028.0,"I used to feel like this when I was 21 especially 22. I felt so under appreciated, I felt lonely, depressed. Your 21st birthday should be a big milestone , sadly I spent mine in my bedroom alone , crying , and thinking about how I wanted to die. I felt my life was over at 21 . My self-esteem was at an all time low and I gave myself to guys unwillingly and let them manipulate me without consent as I felt I needed to prove to them I was worthy  and that I was nothing if I didn’t do as they pleased. I have literally no friends and shut myself from the world. I am now 23 almost 24 and my outlook to life has changed drastically in these last 2 years. I feel that I am worthy , loved and I appreciate life more than ever. I have slowly overcome my social anxiety and I am giving myself encouragement everyday to continue to live. I am graduating with an engineering degree in less than 6 months and I can’t be more excited for it! I feel my 20’s are getting better and the fact that my early 20’s were mostly a representation of an extremely social anxious and depressed women doesn’t mean the rest of my 20’s will be like this. In these past 2 years, the road to healing was not easy , I went through intensive therapy as well as tried to balance my life as best as possible and took a step back from the burnout I was experiencing from trying to be a perfectionist at school. I had taken a semester off to recover for my mental health and I have gotten a part time job my field which helped my self-esteem. The 20’s do get better , it might seem like life is not worth living but believe me that you are worth it and life gets better if you take everything one step at a time. Remember to breathe and don’t rush through things . Hope this helps 😀"

I feel university is honestly the more valuable option if you plan to move out of Quebec and work in other cities/countries as CEGEP is not recognized as a baseline certification outside of Quebec. If you plan on working in Silicon Valley, for instance, you would definitely need to have a Bachelors let alone a Masters Degree in the Information Technology Domain.  I feel it is worth it 100% as I know of people who are >30 and who are studying Software Engineering alongside me.
