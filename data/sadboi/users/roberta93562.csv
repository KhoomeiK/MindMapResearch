BreakUps,fpey2k9,t1_fpebnw9,1588557427.0,"Exactly, my ex said that he's not enough, he's a bad person and I deserve better. We end up getting back together, after a month he broke up with me again telling that he didn't like me that much and it absolutely ruined me. 

So, where there are signs there is always something more."

BPD,fp4u4i3,t3_gazy08,1588307443.0,"I had a very similar situation last week. We were together about 2 months and he left saying that he need some time alone. I am absolutely broken, don't know if I'll be able to forget him, I really had the ""love of my life"" feeling for him. And I don't know if this is from BPD, my need to validation and love or if this is real."

BreakUps,fon8hxw,t3_g88pp2,1587914508.0,"Same, I dated a lot but anyone was like him, I never had so strong feelings for someone and now I feel like I'm going back to the cold, casual an pointless relationships I've had. 

It's a feeling of emptiness."

BreakUps,foiqp9t,t3_g7k60z,1587793972.0,"When we were together I used to look his social media like 4 times a day, we broke up once and I used to keep his conversation open on WhatsApp just to see him online, what when it happen feels like hell.

Now we broke up for real so I decided to block him in all social media cause I knew I would be looking all the time,  would end up finding a lot of new things that will hurt me and I don't need that right? You don't need that. Broke up in itself is already painful, you don't need more pain that you could avoid. 
 
My advice is blocking, you'll feel so much better and the healing process will be easier."

Second I think really love my personal space, do my things in my own time, go out and get back whenever I want to and with kids I couldn't do this anymore."

socialskills,fepo8qe,t3_eq4cqc,1579325889.0,"Yes! Exactly the same. When I was a kid I always was excluded, it used to hurt me a lot and my mom said that I should ignore them and keep going my life. Now is really hard to make decisions by myself and I always end up puting the others desires before my on. That's really really sucks"
