Anxiety,fp0njae,t1_fozfc5v,1588212883.0,"I think there has been a wild global/earthly shift in massive massive amounts energy that started just before or right after Covid— I don’t know about all of you, but in the months leading up to all this something about my anxiety has felt dramatically different....

They proliferate in shady regions of the yard where soil is typically very damp. They popped up about a month ago and have grown quickly. They haven’t flowered and don’t have buds that look like they’ll develop into flowers.
