I disagree.  Perhaps there would have been better options than Wordpress, but you as a single coder are not going to be able to build a better and more secure wheel than the frameworks that have benefited from tens of thousands of eyes over many years, all working together to build a more secure product.

Chances are better than not that you would overlook security features that you can take for granted in modern frameworks out of the box.  There's virtually no benefit to not utilizing the various Symfony components for database connections, for example, because their components are top notch.  If you were to start fresh and design something robust, secure, and elegantly coded to OOP standards, you would basically design Symfony, and so not using it would be a waste of time. 

On top of that, no reasonably complex system is realistically maintainable by a single person.  Most of the major web frameworks are open source and have teams of people constantly working on new features and better security.  Those that are commercial closed source at the very least have professional teams maintaining their code bases.

Additionally, the extensibility of the various frameworks and integration into modern IDEs make them incomparable to custom solutions.  PHPStorm, for example, understands Symfony scaffolding and can navigate the code base without doing more than installing a plugin.  If you built something custom, you would be forced to either forego a lot of modern IDE features, or you'd have to spend time building a plugin.

Lastly, Wordpress aside, modern PHP frameworks like Symfony are incredibly elegant.  If you can make something better, you should, but I'm not sure how you would even improve in a way that Symfony (or Laravel etc.) isn't already working on.

> It was much better than Shopify across the board. 

Yes, Shopify is horrible.

>It would have been faster

Than Wordpress?  Very possible, as Wordpress is fairly old and come with bloat.  But other modern frameworks are very fast.  

> and more flexible.

Possibly?  But Wordpress has one of the most flexible plugin systems on the market.  You can basically hook into virtually anything you want without touching the WP core.

>I was hoping to give OP a simple argument for still learning HTML and CSS

Wordpress or not, if you want to build serious websites you have to know how to code.  But there is plenty of space for WP in the webdev market.  I would say WP sites account for approximately 30% of my firm's clients, and all custom, no WYSIWYG.

> but ultimately one would be better off simply learning the fundamentals that run the web.

This isn't an either-or.  If you want to do WP development you have to know full stack development.  If you want to do a WP blog you don't need it, but for anything more than that, WP is just serving as a base on which you build a custom coded solution."
HTML,fr6jmwk,t3_gmovde,1589927475.0,"Wix and the like have an extremely limited feature set and are really only good for small scale sites.  If you want anything custom or complex you need to know how to program (note: program, not just HTML and CSS)."
HTML,fr6j8y7,t1_fr550y8,1589927274.0,"Wordpress is in a completely different category than Wix and Weebly.  Unlike the other two, it's completely customizable and allows you to hook into the source rather than what the page builder exposes.  It's also extensively customizable through a robust plugin system.

While it does have a page builder (multiple, actually), it's not primarily a WYSIWYG product but rather a PHP based CMS that includes a WYSIWYG that some people use and some people don't.

Moreover, Wordpress is completely free and not a SASS product like the other two.  You can have it on your own domain for free as well and you can install it on whatever host you want.  It's also not primarily an e-commerce platform like the other two, but rather can be used as one if you install WooCommerce.  WooCommerce, like Wordpress, is also insanely customizable and in a totally different league than Wix and Weebly.

When you build a custom Wordpress theme, you have all the same freedom of a full stack application because it is a full stack application.  That is, you build WP themes with CSS/HTML/JS/MySql/PHP just as you might if you weren't using Wordpress.  

What Wordpress offers is functionality out of the box to manage and present content in a very streamline fashion without having to manually setup a DB or write  functions common to most non-static sites.  How simple or complex you want to make that is completely up to you, and that's why it can cost $2k-$100k for a business to get a Wordpress site developed. 

This is not to say that it's the best solution to every problem.  Wordpress with WooCommerce is a great choice, for example, for an e-commerce site, but it's not the best solution to enterprise level applications.   For that you would be better off starting with a framework like Symfony or even something built with Java.  It's great for a marketing page that shows off your company, but it would not be great to try and build a Reddit clone on it.  Etc."

Ultralight,fr52kal,t1_fr51nky,1589901367.0,"> No. What's the use case for that?

For the public lands thing or for the imagery thing?  

For the public lands thing, it's to be able to easily browse the map for camping locations on certain types of land.  For example, right now there are fire restrictions on FS land but not on BLM land, so I would like to peruse BLM areas only.  It's still doable with the current public lands layer, it's just a bit muddled with all the other public lands, and it's not always easy to see the difference between similarly colored lands (e.g. BLM vs FWS).  This isn't a huge deal, I just figured there might already be a way to do it with the various topo builder features but that I might be missing it.

For the imagery thing, the use case is being able to plan out future trips.  So let's say that it's April right now and I want to get an idea of what a particular mountain range looks like in June.  Is it still really snowed out on average and does the snow start to melt out in May? Or do I have to wait until July?

With the current setup, I can look at April last year, or I can look up until November of last year, but I can't look at conditions from May to October.  Ideally I'd like to be able to select an arbitrary month going back a few years so as to attempt to get an average of the conditions."

Generally you can subtract 1 from whatever the tents claimed capacity is to get a realistic idea of how big the tent is. E.g. a 2p tent is cramped for 2 and not bad for 1. 

As far as lighter goes, I don't know that there's much insofar as fully freestanding tents go. But if you'd be interested in a trekking pole tent (which doesn't necessarily mean you need trekking poles since most can be purchased with alternate tent poles) you could look at the Lightheart SoLong. It's a one person tent made for tall people and is legitimately spacious for one person. It could technically even fit two if you had a small girlfriend. It comes in at 2 pounds, and the poles I think are 2 oz a piece, so right around 2lbs4oz for a rather spacious tent.

As far as bags go, might be worth reconsidering a lighter pack, though you can get cheaper than an HMG. 

Even if you're not thru hiking, you'll definitely appreciate every pound off of your back.  It's a nice feeling to be able to go on a 4 day trip and carry less than 25 pounds."

Yes some will get out there, but it will be less.  Just because some people will break the law does not mean you shouldn't have laws.

>There are backpackers out there who litter and damage the landscape. Why should we allow any backpackers? 

If I started to see that deep wilderness areas were on average full of trash, then I would 100% advocate for closing off public lands to backpackers.  Thankfully this is not the case and backpackers are in general the kind of people who pack out their own trash as well as other people's when they find it.  However, bikes do damage to trails and will allow increased access to people who aren't necessarily from a subculture based around LNT.  If I had to guess, I would say that this decision would increase litter.

This weird anti-gate keeping meme needs to die.  Not everyone should have access to everything all the time.  Gate keeping keeps people from waling into your house or camping on your front lawn.  Gate keeping via permit systems keep people from destroying popular national trails.  Gate keeping makes sure that people who compete in the Olympics are actually athletes worth competing and not just random joes.

Moreover, I don't want the backcountry full of BLM officers patrolling for illegal bikes even if they did have the funding.

Again, they claim it, but it's probably not close to accurate.  [Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/euwcv1/updated_klymit_rvalues_with_the_new_astm_standard/) a thread with new values after the new ASTM standard was released, where the 4.4 was revised to 1.9.

>They were older REI bags but still had good loft

Older 0* REI bags with good loft should have been fine the 30s...unless the pad wasn't actually its advertised R value.

> Didn't notice any condensation on the pillows. 

Whether you noticed it or not, it was probably there.  Cotton gets damp in the low 30s, and if they were already freezing as you said they were, they probably just didn't notice.  

>That said they're already looking at the X-Lite or X-Therm. 

Good choices.  A legit 4+ R value is necessary for a bag's EN rating to be accurate.  A woman at 20* probably wants an xtherm."

Ultralight,fqk3mcv,t3_gjc4o3,1589419601.0,"That Klymit pad is almost certainly not actually anywhere near close to a 4.4 r value. Klymit may claim it, but you're getting what you pay for with a pad that cheap.

Honestly, it could just be that, but it really also depends on which 0* bags they were using. It's possible that they were just bad bags combined with a weak pad.

That said, pillows from home probably didn't help either. They probably had cotton linings which means that they collected condensation and got cold as fuck.

Anyway, most quilt manufacturer's reported temps are lower limit temps, which means you need to subtract another 10 to 20 degrees to get a comfort (e.g. women's) temp. If you're expecting to camp in 20*, get a 0* quilt.

That said, I would recommend not getting a quilt as a woman for temps that low. Go for a high quality women's sleeping bag instead and get a better pad and pillow as well."

Ultralight,fqhivp5,t1_fqh4nki,1589377894.0,"A lot of reviews are absolute BS too because Google just takes you to blogs pushing affiliate links. Some are most trustworthy than others, but shit like Outdoor Gear Lab and yes even Clever Hiker are basically just informative advertisements that tend to ignore a lot of great gear from companies that don't have an affiliate program. 

Even then, they do always mention a few negatives, and it's easy for that shit to get in your head and make you second think yourself.  

Here's the inoculation:

1. There is no perfect piece of gear. Everything you buy will have trade offs. More importantly, you will live through the night with those trade offs because we're not talking life-risking tradeoffs. You'll either carry a bit more weight, have to replace your gear a bit more often, get a little cold, sleep a little worse, or pay a bit more.

You'll live.

2.  Even if there is a perfect piece of gear, you can live without it.  Scouts and soldiers have been backpacking with hefty equipment and 50 lbs+ packs for decades. Basically any minimal investment into a few modern  UL items is going to get you a setup far more comfortable than what most people have backpacked with since up until relatively recently. Just save the pack for last so that you're carrying something a little more supportive until you hit 25lbs.

3. The wilderness is not your living room couch and the sky is not your TV. You're going to get cold, wet, uncomfortable, less and worse sleep, cuts, scrapes, and bruises. 

And that's ok. Embrace it. Cuts heal, you'll sleep better later, you'll warm up and dry off hiking. 

You can live with and through some temporary minor discomfort and it's all worth it when you see those amazing views of the mountains or hit the next goal in your list.
