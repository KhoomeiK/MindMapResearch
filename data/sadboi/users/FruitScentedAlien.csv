To be hurt and taken advantage of along the way, until there is balance. Empaths are the closest thing to angels on earth (other than animals) but should never risk their happiness above others who do not deserve it. Empaths are humanity."

One thing I've tried to do since being with a narc is create new things about me that are good. Create a new better me. I try to be more compassionate than I ever was... but for the right people and a lot of people aren't the right people unfortunately. It has nothing to do with you being 'prey' or 'deserving' of it in any way I've realized. My narc always thought they had bpd. I have no clue if they actually are or not because that was always their excuse for treating me badly. I hope one day you don't feel like this. I definitely think that however you feel is valid though. I haven't seen what you've seen, we all have diff stories with narcs. Mine was covert."

I was with my narc for 2 years and I tried to be ""friends"" with them for one and just had enough. I feel lucky that I was able identify them being a narc earlier on as some people don't. I feel lucky that I pushed myself to cut them off. I thought there was something wrong with me all that time. I can't imagine 6 years I am so sorry about that. I hope that you realized early that they were a narc. But even one year of narc bs is already too much. 30 days is too much. That's so very true. All the things they had issues with, nobody was bothered by either so it really does show that you shouldn't put your boundaries and desires to the side because they're just as important as anybody else's.

Adoptive parents are my rolemodels as well, my adoptive father was my best friend actually. I'm 20, so I'm not sure if I really count as an adult. I just got in contact with my birth mom recently which years or even months ago was something I would have immediately dismissed the idea of. I got in contact with her because her health is not the most amazing. I have learnt some things about myself and some things do seem to make more sense after contacting her because I am prone to certain things that nobody else in my life has had or understands. Well, my point is being 20 years old and being adopted had affected me in a good way surprisingly. Before I contacted my bio mom? I don't know if I could say this. When I was younger and did not know her, I sometimes felt lonely and different. Bc like I said, some of the problems I'm prone to. I feel good with this fresh info. I had a lot of questions. But I feel lucky because I am given chances I wouldn't have been if I wasn't adopted. Obviously part of me wonders what it would be like to not be adopted but because I was, I've been spoiled and very lucky. I like who I am and I always try to improve. I feel as if I was not adopted, I would not be as confident in myself as I am today. I feel lucky and I know that's not the case for everyone but at the end of the day, you define who you are. This is just how it has happened for me. You don't really inherit a personality or who you want to be in life."

I understand what its like feeling like you don't know where to go from where you are right now but eventually it will come to you. It has to. You're trying your best."
acne,fjjc9u6,t1_fjhuwdi,1583390084.0,"Yeah totally understandable. I wish photoshop didn't exist when it comes to this. I saw something that said ""Instagram has made people believe they're supposed to look perfect so now good is disposable/not good enough."" It's a sad thing. I hope that kids actually enjoy being alive and being young... not growing up feeling like shit because they have some acne and don't look like what the media sells them."

Instagramreality,fjiu50u,t3_fdef6m,1583375797.0,this is scary. scary as in i hope people don't see this and suddenly desire this. also scary as in i hope this person gets help.
MakeupLounge,fjhvopt,t3_fcwah1,1583355920.0,I appreciate this so much because I actually feel like I could get away with wearing colors like this.

acne,fjhmiuv,t1_fjh9o1t,1583350996.0,"Honestly I get where you're coming from. I wish this was the norm, no make up often. I feel like we'd all actually be less hard on ourselves. But at the same time, I can totally understand why someone would wear make up. I stopped wearing foundation from starting at age 14 to 17 but I also understand the appeal of doing so. Which is why I put on some concealer if I wanna go the extra mile and feel a little better. I also definitely felt too insecure to go without when I was younger, I got up earlier in the morning to do it because I just felt so bad about my skin then yanno?"

curlyhair,fjftsf1,t3_fd205j,1583300062.0,"In the first pic, you look like the kind of person to bully me and in the second pic you look like the kind of person to tell me to keep my head up and embrace who I am because the other guy is wrong. Your curls are beautiful. They suit you well!"
crueltyfree,fjfo2l7,t1_fjeynbj,1583295937.0,I didn't post this but I appreciate this comment because I have been looking for a cf deodorant since dove still animal tests but the one I tried without aluminum was a no go. I could smell myself shortly after. üò≠ I can wear it if its cold and I hop right in bed but that's it. So thank you.

acne,fjfgeqw,t1_fjc3i2b,1583291273.0,"I actually find that Snapchat is very similar to how your skin is in person so I appreciate that. At least for me! 

Thank you, yeah truly. I sometimes feel like dermatologists aren't that great. Some are really good don't get me wrong but I think they really just want to push medications when that may not even be necessary tbh. I never look forward to winter because I think it's alright in fall, but winter is just like everything bad. Did I mention I'm a winter baby too?! How ironic. 

Hey, I don't judge. U do u man. üòÇ"

i really appreciate your comment, thanks for taking the time!"
Fungalacne,fje678c,t3_fcxxkx,1583266009.0,Yes I believe so. I had a UTI and had to take antibiotics at the hospital and bam. FA all under my jawline and chin. I hated it.

You're totally right with everything you said. I'm going to spend some time thinking and not make any immediate decisions either.  There is no reason to."
