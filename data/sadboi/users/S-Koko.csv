AskReddit,ffx1yzr,t3_evpan0,1580316024.0,"Has anyone ever felt the worse depression after sex.
This happened to me this morning, I had sex with a girl i had been thinking about. And it was great and all however, after i can not help but to feel ""well time to get ghosted"".
But, more importantly it is becoming harder and harder to communicate and associate. 
No advice will help , I just wonder who else feels this?"

I have just graduated college and have a job lined up, but, I would rather grab my bug out bag a few hundred rounds and live in the wilderness for a while.
Life around people is just so taxing. I just want to follow my instincts in the wild. I have heard a calling for years now. It intreats me to follow it. However, I ignore it.
Well not ignore, I just do not heed the call.
It feels like the place I wonder off to will be serine  and aggression will only be used to hunt or fight a wild animal.
As apposed to raw human aggression from a need to control.
A place that is fluid like the seasons internally and externally. The calm balanced by the intense moments. They would give each other contrast so I never lose sight of how important one is. As well as all other emotions and mental states without the negative human societal aspect of them.
Like gender roles, expectations as what a man should be by people who have never been one. 
No longer being judged on my physical appearance, no racism. What would a  care if walk around 90% unclothed ?

It wouldn't!

Just myself the wild and natural selection."
