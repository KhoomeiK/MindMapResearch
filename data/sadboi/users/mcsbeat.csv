AMA,fmwx29c,t1_fmwf2ka,1586454550.0,"Hmm. A good question.

I'm sure everyone has heard about the whole ''ooh this person is so mature for their age'' thing. And I suppose I agree. A 17-year-old could very likely be more mature, or ''adult-ish'', than an 18 or a 19 year-old. 

I'd say a person's upbringing - and therefore the leading choices of that - nurture, shape and educate them into a mature, responsible and an honest adult."

mentalhealth,fhddhki,t1_fhd1e8u,1581483164.0,"I wish i could give you an award.

I was in an abusive relationship for almost a year which caused me to develop anxiety and depression. My gf was depressed and always relied on me, constant reassurance; she got mad at me for stupid things and blamed it on her depression. She refused to get help, and claimed that ""You're the only one to help me fight my demons"".

I took the role of her therapist, since she had refused to get one, and I was constantly under tremendous pressure of worrying if she'd kill herself if I do something wrong - or break up with her. She didn't love herself, she gave all that love to me, but only when I listened to her. Depression and her problems became the only talking point for us.

I know her depression is not merely the cause of the manipulative and abusive behavior. I know that you can love a depressed person. I know that she was a manipulative asshole.

I am not stating that you cannot love a depressed person; but we have heard so many similar things in this subreddit. So many depressed people tend to get narcissistic in relationships, possibly because they have not felt love in a long time and desperately want to hold onto that.

AMA,ezvmllf,t1_ezui5wy,1568184870.0,"They are always so beautiful. I've only experienced the green ones. Here in the east you can probably spot them a couple of times a month during the fall-spring season if the sky's clear. I'm not that used to them though, I've seen the northern lights maybe two or three times since there are big city lights nearby and the sky's not always that clear. But when we do get them, they always announce it in the news 'Open up your curtains - we're getting a lightshow tonight'. Then everyone gathers outside to watch. And the next day instagram's full of them. In Rovaniemi, Lapland, if you're lucky, you can spot them many times a week! 

We call the northern lights 'revontulet', 'fox fires'. It originates from an old Sami tale of a fox running through the snowy hills, hitting its tail on the piles of snow, creating sparks that blow to the sky - northern lights."

AMA,ezu8l78,t1_ezu6n52,1568147386.0,"Moi! I love saunas. Unfortunately, after I moved into a different apartment in December, my sauna habits changed a lot. My current apartment is really small and cheap due to me being a broke student. I had to get an apartment without a personal sauna and settle with the flat's shared sauna. When I had my own sauna I used it a couple of times per week, usually in winter even more. When I was a child we had the popular 'lauantaisauna', 'saturday night sauna' with the family to dust off all the past week's worries and to relax.
I remember tasting reindeer meat when I was younger. It tasted almost exactly like beef, but with a little saltiness to it. Reindeer meat and reindeers in general are more common in Lapland, I live in the eastern part with a load of lakes. I have yet to see a pack of reindeer meat in a grocery store here in the more southern regions :)"
