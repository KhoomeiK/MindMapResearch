I would particularly encourage looking for resources that are actually produced by or at least in collaboration with Aboriginal people rather than the white observer perspective. I forget what it was called but there was a great ABC series that went into Aboriginal history and culture, I think it was called First People but I may be wrong.

I also would recommend a great short film that is a role-reversal satire on Indigenous/white relations, it's on YouTube and is called Babakueria (sp). It's brilliant.

Also can't go past the YouTube videos of Uncle Bob Randall. He was this adorable grandpa type dude, had a lot of wisdom and humour. I watch his videos and think ""I want to have a cup of tea with him."" But he talks about his relationship to the land and you really can learn a lot. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0sWIVR1hXw

Ditto to ""pressure"" to find a partner. Pressure from whom, and why does their opinion matter? There is nothing tragic or defective about single women and we each individually have to push back on that cultural conditioning or it will never change.

You're thinking too universally. All that matters is what works for the individual/s in question.

In short, what ""society"" thinks about your living situation has as much importance as YOU give it. Also, you're not locked into everything. No decision you make now regarding your living situation can't be revised later if your circumstances or values or desires change.

I would like to meet someone but I refuse to put all my energy into it or make it a project. I see much more value in just living my life, pursuing my interests and friendships and developing myself as a person. I figure I will either meet someone or I won't, but regardless, I want to know myself and pursue the things that make me a whole person rather than just pining away for The One.

I will also say that I would recommend reading up on social conditioning. Women are conditioned to believe we are somehow tragic or defective if we are single. That is complete BS and there is a lot of literature out there on how to undo that programming. 

That said. General advice for if/when you do meet someone: keep your interests and your friendships. Have a life outside of the relationship and don't allow yourself to be consumed. A healthy relationship with a respectful partner allows you the space to continue to be your own person.

I truly believe she actually had these thoughts sometimes but it was also used to make me run to her (she refused to see a psychologist because and I quote ""they're all idiots""), and as someone who also often has suicidal ideation, I find/found that deeply unfair. You do not threaten that so people will do what you want.

I went no-contact 3 years ago and I don't regret it. She tries to interact every so often and I just go grey rock, keep it short and pleasant. I don't hate her, I don't think she's evil. However I have never seen any evidence that she is willing to work on her own stuff. It's always someone else's fault. I work very hard on mine and I expect the same in friendships now.

And- full disclosure- I have been an abusive friend to others (not in recent times.) It took me a long time to realise it, I was too wrapped up in my own misery and dysfunction to see other people's needs. It's why I work so hard now to be the most generous and respectful friend I can be. Because I learnt boundaries, both asserting them and respecting them."
OCD,fqpw8d3,t1_fqpvu5m,1589555114.0,"Ok, fair enough. I would ask if they do telehealth (sessions via phone or Zoom.) Mine is. A lot are."
OCD,fqpqhg6,t1_fqpo1ru,1589552056.0,No I agree with you.
OCD,fqpn38c,t3_gjwu1j,1589550132.0,"How long have you been talking to this guy? Have you made progress, and does he have actual expertise in OCD?

He may be allowing his own frustration at the COVID situation to leak into sessions, and that would be very unprofessional.

However, I can also understand how it might be frustrating to offer several diversion tactics over time (has he done this?) only to have the client always come up with reasons why they're not possible.

My instinct would be to actually bring your feelings about this session to your next session. Tell him exactly what you told us. His response will tell you whether you need to find someone else."
melbourne,fqpkbtg,t1_fqp1qsd,1589548418.0,"It's not necessarily.

I have a mental illness and (along with other management protocols like clinical psychology and exercise) is proving helpful. It doesn't have to have a spiritual or woo element at all, it's just training the mind.

I definitely agree though that corporations use it to exploit their workers more. But mindfulness in and of itself is neutral, it's how it's used."
melbourne,fqpk76n,t1_fqp5y1l,1589548336.0,"Yeah Russ Harris also is basically the architect of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) based on mindfulness tenets and has written a generally well-regarded book called The Happiness Trap. 

He's a former GP. My clinical psychologist (who is incredible) speaks highly of his work."
OCD,fqpjqrn,t3_gjzwmg,1589548040.0,"This is extremely common. Many, many of us have experienced this very thing and the problem is, the more you ruminate on the ""memory"" and try to figure it out, the stronger and more real it feels. Also very common to feel like everyone thinks you're a good person and you're lying to them. Reassurance-seeking will NOT help.

Are you speaking with a professional? That is the only thing that is going to help. OCD is often very misunderstood even amongst therapists so you would ideally find a clinical psychologist and one who has demonstrated OCD expertise."
OCD,fqpji2s,t3_gjxs07,1589547885.0,"Yeah pretty bad.

Listen, I don't want to be rude but you have posted a noticeable amount of topics on this one subject (I noticed your name, I'm not trawling through your post history.)

That is reassurance-seeking, and isn't going to fix the problem and I think you know that. Are you talking to a professional?"
Centrelink,fqphyrd,t3_gjznk2,1589546856.0,"Not what you asked, but re your dog's surgery, call the vet tomorrow and explain the situation. Vets won't advertise this but some will allow you to do a payment plan especially if you've been a client for a while. My vet clinic's official position is ""no payment plans"" but they've allowed me to with my cat when the procedure has been expensive because I've been going to them for years.

Alternatively, if you're in Melbourne, Lort Smith animal hospital usually will work with you on payments if you're experiencing hardship."
australia,fqpgfe0,t3_gjnomi,1589545747.0,"This is a really complex issue. I'm not a fan of smoking at all (I've supported whenever bans are put in place at various locations) but  a lot of homeless people have mental illnesses which they self-medicate with smoking. I had no idea this was even a thing until I had a friend with schizophrenia. Not homeless, but apart from his meds, the way he stabilised his moods was with hours at the gym and chain-smoking. That literally was the only combination he found that worked for him (he knew what it did to his body, but his mind needed it.) I started reading up and apparently smoking does have a mood-stabilising effect for some people. 

And smoking is addictive anyhow, as the OP has said.

I do worry too that now with COVID-19, picking up things from the ground to put in your mouth is going to be even riskier than ever. I don't know what the answer is (barring a UBI) but I agree, no-one should be reduced to that."
