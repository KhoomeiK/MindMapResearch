legaladvicecanada,fqy9g60,t1_fqy8ma6,1589744906.0,Buddy you've got no clue what you're talking about and really shouldn't talk about things you clearly dont know. Those things happened 20 years ago and btw the news jumps on stories here in Canada about police violence against POC. You really should familiarize yourself with it and in canada. I mean the link you provided that is supposedly where you got your statistics from was a search engine with no mention of police violence on aboriginal people. It showed that if anything they dont take cases involving aboriginal people as serious as they do as cases that involve white victims
legaladvicecanada,fqwqw1g,t1_fqwqskf,1589714551.0,Also if you read the thing you posted you would know that there is no mention of police being violent towards aboriginals
legaladvicecanada,fqwqskf,t1_fqw2p6b,1589714453.0,Then your friends are full of bull shit . I live in canada and live close and have always lived close to reservations in fact the ones I live next to our known to protest issues they have and bot once have they ever protested against police violence. If there is as much as your claiming ( which their is not) the news would be reporting on it along with a y protests that may happen. If it was true what you're saying then some of the police officers would have acted with force and caused injury to the ones who were protesting canada wide just a few months ago.

legaladvicecanada,fpowc1m,t1_fplgm94,1588791779.0,"This here. I had something similar. Lived in a place and had a dog ( E.S.A) that was approved by the landowner. When I walked her if someone got to close she would bark. She did this at the maintenance guy and me and him got into an altercation with him telling me my dog was cross and that I wasn't allowed to have her in the apartment ( ended with me telling the maintenance guy to f off and that she was pre approved before I even moved in.) and anyway the next day I get a call about my dog ""barking"" while am out in classes. Asked a neighbor I was pretty close with who lived above me and he said other then the rare time where theres a big noise he didn't hear the dog bark and when he did it was only for a few seconds. So after this I decided to record my apartment while I was out. Next time the landlord called saying someone complained about my dog specifically ( my dog was a GSD and there was also one living below me) I told her I started recording when I left the apartment and my dog was not barking. Landlord then tried saying that I told her the dog was a therapy dog. I told her I said no such thing that it was an E.S.A and I had shown her the prescription from doctor I had for her. I then told her it's funny because I was living in the apartment for 5 months and that I find it's funny that this is the first time calling ( second actually) and it was after an altercation I had with the maintenance guy. She then backed up saying that she was receiving complaints for month and when I asked her why didn't she call me when she received the first one she said it was to cut me a break. Long story short once I told her I was recording and documenting everything when I left the apartment she stopped calling me. To add something else. They also tried to blame me for my dog using the washroom in the parking lot. Came home from Christmas break to see a notice pinned to my door. Called them up asked them what's with the notice and she said that over the past week someone had seen me letting my dog crap in the grass by the parking lot. I told her they must of been on crack because I was 8 hours away for the past two weeks and if she wanted me to I could show her gas receipts, she then tried saying that the notice was for everyone and was just a warning for people who owned dogs to not let them use the washroom there"

My father worked in something called flight feeding so in addition to the hours he worked ( usually 4am-5pm) he would also get called in at random hours when they had flights leaving. Some days I wouldn't even see my father as he would get called to go back into work as soon as he left the base. About a year or so after we moved there my mother went back to school to get her CCA's and they were making really good money. I never wanted for anything and my other older youngest brother ( 12 years older then me) would often get mad saying that I get ( and he will still say this) more stuff then he ever did. Whenever he brings this up my mother reminds him of the time where she saved up her money on welfare to buy him and my other brother and sister a NES when it first came out. Because my parents worked more hours then most people they had more financial freedom we went on vacation almost yearly, I was always up to date with the latest video game system and money was one thing they weren't stressed about. My parents also always made sure they had time for me no matter how much they worked. They were always there for my sport games/practises and school stuff. The way I grew up some people night called spoiled but it also makes me want to be able to give my kid if I ever have one the same experiences I had growing up"
