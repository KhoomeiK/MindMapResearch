This reminds me of one of my deals on Mudah, not a scam but still bothers me. So I was selling my motorcycle, and this guy was desperate for it. Some tauke already reserved the moto, but out of kasian I declined and offered it to the guy instead. He's Sabahan, and said ""sama sama Borneo bah, we come here not many relatives sini"".

So I told him, ""ok deal"", told him that the tauke could easily find another deal, told him I was selling to him because I could relate to his hardship, ""East Malaysians help each other"", as he said.

Then he asked for my bank account and sent me HALF the money, WITHOUT even meeting me first. The next day he went all the way from Penang to PJ to get the moto.

It bothered me because it could've been a scam. Things I said to him, they were something a scammer could've said as well. I'm no angel but what if I was a scammer? Or if it was a scammer that he made a deal with?

So we met later and I told him, ""Bro you crazy ah. I'm scared for you. Banked in half without even meeting, wtf. You could've gone all the way from Penang for nothing."" He laughed it off and took note.

Just be careful out there. It's good to trust and be easy-going like the guy, this makes the deal easier, but you'll never know. Lots of scammers out there."

I'm an irreligious Sarawakian indigenous but dated Malay girls in the past. Although they were just flings, the ""what if"" question did cross my mind sometimes. I think it's pretty sad. Our society and laws here are still very much race- and religion-obsessed.

If you (hypothetical ""you"") jump ship, your family will be distraught, and even enraged if they are less liberal about this whole conversion thing. If s/he jump ships, an entire group of people and even the law will be on his/her tail if they find out.

Even if your family or SO's family are accepting of the conversion (whether it's your conversion or your SOs), then you still have the law being in the picture. If your SO leaves her religion, they have to be discreet, only IC says they practice but with you they aren't. If you get into their religion, then a huge chunk of your identity will be changed. Your lifestyle, your official identity (IC, etc). In both cases, you or your SO sort of lose a part of your identities.

I sure as hell don't want to change my lifestyle. As an irreligious person, I already feel alienated enough and detached the society around me, let alone if I need to adopt a religion which belief I (respectfully) largely disagree with. If I were a Muslim, I'd be pretty sad to see my SO adopting a new identity even if they are willing.

A family friend of ours went to Turkey recently. When talking about the culture, you know what their guide said? He said, friendly but bluntly, ""We are not like you Malaysians. We can have marriages between different ethnicities and religions but nobody is forced to convert into anything."" I feel like we'd do a lot better if we adopt the same thing here.

That said, not all is lost. I have some friends who married Muslims but their SOs never forced them to change anything. Some still go out drinking as usual, even bringing their SOs. They do forfeit things like eating pork out of respect. But that's not the norm of course, just the people I know. But I also have friends whose SOs, not even engaged yet let alone married, already nagging them to learn this and that religious practices. So that definitely fits what you said about the brownie points.

Anyway just my 2 cents. Sorry for being panjang berjela. I see similar posts like this in the past and it always saddened me a bit that a lot of Malaysians have to go through these dilemmas."

My chest feels kinda heavy imagining that...

On a more positive note, last year my family took a dog from her previous owner. She was shaking when they dropped her at our house. About three years old, clearly abused. Thrown into the river, etc. Also apparently she was stolen from her original owner, she's not a local breed dog. My grandmother and I bathed her, broke my heart seeing her like that.

She was with us for a while but we already have another dog in the family. I think she never had a loving home so when she started getting comfy, she trashed our backyard. Set free two of my dad's pet birds (they even sat around on the electric pole near our house, grandmother said they probably wanted to go back to their cage). She probably needed more playtime but everyone's busy.

So I said if we love her, we should find her a loving home where people can give her all the attention she deserves.

She's now staying with one of our close family friends at their farm house. Got a small pond, got all the space she needs to run. She's all filled up now too. They bring her everywhere, she looks so happy now."

sex,f77wnwa,t1_f77vxzc,1573478440.0,"Upvote for pipi. Yeah he's doing fine, it's been nearly 2 weeks. It's not STDs that I was worried about, but knocking someone up. Obviously it's all fine, like deep inside I know that, but my stupid paranoid brain gets the better of me. For context, we cut contact."
sex,f77uzo1,t1_f77un3x,1573476717.0,"Ah completely understandable, I would be freaked out and turned off too by such request. No worries, you're absolutely right on the paranoia part. I'm recovering from some bad times so I might not be in the right frame of mind. Just needed some assurance on this particular encounter I guess.

Appreciate you my dude. Thanks!"
sex,f77ugex,t1_f77u5ro,1573476144.0,"Thanks for your response dude. No holes or anything, and obviously I put on a new one for the second round. She didn't seem like someone who doesn't take good care of herself, being a young professional and all that, so I wasn't worried about STDs although I plan on a check sometime in the near future once I'm back to being active.

I guess I was just insanely paranoid. Would anyone be comfortable if I asked them to take BC, and plan B, with me on protection on top of that? Overkill but it's like that's the only thing that'll calm me completely."
bjj,f6imbr9,t1_f6ik23e,1572880874.0,"Ah, my bad. Thanks for clarifying. Highest level of sambo, I meant."
bjj,f6iajwe,t1_f6i60xb,1572875117.0,"Khabib vs Poirier is not a good white belt vs black belt jiujiteros comparison though. I think of them more like a highest level of sambo ~~black belt~~ vs a jiujitsu black belt. Obviously Poirier isn't known to be an elite black belt, as Danaher says, there are black belts, then *there are black belts.*"
bjj,f6hzewb,t1_f6hyx9e,1572868795.0,"Huh, good examples. I didn't know that about Rashad, but I do remember he's a rather good wrestler. As for Faber, he competed and lost to Nicky Ryan (who was iirc a purple belt at the time), although to be fair Nicky is younger. Anyway, his coach's stance does make sense."
bjj,f6hy4ln,t3_drggxe,1572867969.0,"I wonder who he's referring to though (edit: on second thought maybe nobody specific, he's just throwing shades at fake black belts in general, but who knows).

Vitor comes to mind, NOT saying that I think he's fake, but I also heard from Sherdog or somewhere that his blackbelt was ""given"", and he rarely used BJJ.

Then again he almost armbarred Jon Jones."

CasualConversation,f59gabe,t1_f59bsux,1572088014.0,"I get how you feel. I actually came from a very small town myself but for some reason I always enjoyed it as a kid. Rain in small towns isn't flashy but it's so serene. Yes, I stroll a lot at night! You wizard! But I much prefer strolling at the dusk when it's orangey but windy. There's something about the atmosphere that keeps me in-the-present."

Anyone wanna have a lunch with a dude who spent 15 minutes figuring out the way to cross from KL Gateway Mall to the LRT station?

Leaving in a few days after a one-year stay. You can vent to me w/o consequences. We can go like touch n go~~~"

Bass,f50d7gc,t1_f4x2yrs,1571925613.0,Sounds super familiar to my ears. But this is the walking bassline style I'm wanting to try! Simple but fun!
