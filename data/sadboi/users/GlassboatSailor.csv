Also I'm probably overthinking this but I'm going out with a friend on Saturday - we normally drink a lot when we go out. I'm planning to drink, but keep it minimal but I'm worrying about how to handle that and that my friend will think it's odd...."

UKProperty,f99912k,t3_e4bxfq,1575188534.0,"I'm in the south east - not a new build but otherwise same situation. House on for 370, owners want a quick sale we can provide it, no chain. We offered 340, they came back with 350 which we accepted. Your offer sounds fair. If you really want the house and are prepared to pay more, offer more, but otherwise do as you are doing and look for other houses. They may come back to you if they don't get another offer."

puppy101,f17yahp,t1_f1521s0,1569250015.0,You have perfectly summed up my frustrations with others. I bumped into a woman who goes to the same training class as me and we JUST did jumping up training this week. My girl jumped at her and she stood here petting her even though I asked her to stop -.- She has two male brother puppies - hello littermate syndrome!
Dogtraining,f04srru,t3_d3nbj2,1568394789.0,"We copied this guy for our puppy https://youtu.be/u__9UQksZag . Obviously all dogs are different but we had great success with this- closing the door whenever the dog tries to leave but opening it otherwise and eventually leaving it open. We did the exercise a couple of times during the first day and then at bedtime. One of us slept in the same room as her and the crate for the first few weeks also, which I think was very comforting.

Like you we fed treats in the crate and also hide them for her to find on her own. The first few nights we wore her out a LOT before bed. She was very loud the first 3 or 4 nights but within 2 weeks she really quietened down and crucially was not scared to go in. Two months later she goes into the crate of her own accord at bedtime. However, in the day she just goes in to get treats and very occasionally a couple of mins lying down. She only gets shut in at night. I'm no expert just sharing my experience and believe she would never get used to the crate if we never shut her in there."
Dogtraining,ezqb3mf,t3_d1q71e,1568056994.0,"Please consider that the martingale and choker leash are cruel ways to control your dog. And my god the prong collar looks like torture. I don't mean to lecture but a dog that behaves based on fear is not a happy dog. The front attached harness is good as it turns the dog around when they pull too hard. Keep doing what you're doing with stopping walking when they pull and rewarding frequently when they walk next to you. 

Another concern I have is that according to my vet, a 5 month old puppy should be walked for 25 minutes (5 mins per month of age) max at a time to protect their growing limbs. That's actual walking time, running around and playing is ok. 

Hope this doesn't come across too critical but I felt I had to say something here. Good luck!"

With someone I have talked to before at least I worry a lot that I'm gonna ask them something that makes no sense or come across as self centered because I can't be bothered to remember anything they tell me"
