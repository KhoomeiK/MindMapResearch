even your reasoning for not blocking the last hit (which you got FB'd for) didnt make much sense to me. just because you dont have matter doesnt mean you go for a grab. the player had his fb and it was the only thing he could kill you with, and as a person who was running away from him the whole game i wouldve entirely expected that kung lao to go for a fb confrim, if he grabs me who cares i'd still have the life lead. and if he guess wrong the string wouldve been safe and you'd be stuck in the corner. a grab is a hard read that if done wrong wouldve got him killed"

Single player games do the exact same thing except not only are you limited in what you can use, but you have to unlock the rest of the usuable player stuff. Infact multiplayer games will generally offer you alot more upfront while still allowing you to unlock stuff compared to single players being more limiting to make the progression feel stronger. Plenty of bigger multiplayer games will have you unlocking stuff for years after you bought the game while a single player game will be mostly done after you beat the game. Like the things you're complaining about are often worse in single player. 

You think a match having minor variations doesn't matter? The ai in almost every game will have 3 basic moves and do the exact same thing from beginning to end. And in most single player games even when they introduce new enemies with a different moveset the actually way to fight it (maybe go punch it in the face) hasn't changed at all. Just because the story tells you things are different doesn't actually mean they are different for you. That's just a placebo. Things are different when you have to play differently and come up with new strategies and the ai in most single player games don't evolve over the course of the game. You could be fighting the same basic ai for a hour before seeing new enemies that perform the same as the enemies you were just fighting but look different.

&#x200B;

why doesnt that work for single player games? time and budget. sure there are single player games that do well at keeping the gameplay fresh throughout, but it can never come close the variation you get from multiplayer, the little tricks some players will try that you cant program into an ai because its some dumb or good that no one would actually think of it unless you were that dumb or good at the game
