I don’t know why you would bring your young child to a showing of Rocky Horror anyway, it was just kind of frustrating to me that these people put a lot of effort into their costumes and a kid won.

-Download the Forest app! It’s about $3, but so worth it. It basically locks your phone and if you exit the app when your timer is going, the tree dies.

Veterinary,fed987y,t3_eo9b6o,1579004395.0,"I’ve been a veterinary receptionist for over three years now, and I’m in school to become a vet tech, and work as an assistant sometimes, depending on the day. I also have an anxiety disorder.

When I first got my job I had never worked in the veterinary field either. I took home all the brochures we had, nexguard, heartguard, trupanion, anything and just became familiar with them. I googled medications we prescribed often so I became familiar with them. I didn’t start to feel truly comfortable with everything until about 6 months in. 

It does get better with time, and the job is a great learning experience if you want to do assistant or technician work in the future. Anxiety loves the familiar. If it becomes too much, I would look into a job in the kennel. That way you could still transition to an assistant but it isn’t as customer service based. 

Good luck!"
