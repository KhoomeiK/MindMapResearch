I use this coping strategy a lot when I myself experience depression and cannot physically get out of bed. My go to “plan and not the mood” is walking to the end of my street and grabbing a coffee. It’s just a 5 minute walk and an inner battle to get the wheels turning but I can say 9/10 times it helps turn my mood around or gain perspective. It actually surprises me sometimes how much it helps. I think the more times I’m able to “follow the plan and not the mood” and feel better as a result, it helps me make that choice next time I’m feeling not so great and gets a little easier."

So how can people still be be convinced that this is fear or just political agenda? IT. IS. HAPPENING. EVERYWHERE. Polls show most Americans support social distancing measures and that the people protesting are the minority. However, the air time they get on Fox and other stations portray that it’s a majority of Americans. Even more Left leaning stations don’t always give a good idea of how many people are really protesting in relationship to our entire country. I’m pretty anxious about a lot of these states opening though. Our country is getting a lot of mixed signals and a lot different plans. Ive heard it referred to as “patchwork”,  I would say *clusterfuck*. It really seems like Trump is just throwing in the towel and crossing his fingers that his red states come out ahead. It’s a pretty fucked situation when we are all interconnected. Republican Governors (not all) are kissing Trumps ass because they are all worried about re-election and politics during a pandemic. They are willing to down play this and put money, re-election, and approval ahead of lives. Not to mention that giving people want they want vs. what they need because it benefits your own cause is cowardly. These people might as well be sacrifices. When this is all said and done the people who are listening to Trump and not following medical and scientific advice are the people who will suffer the most.

Coronavirus,fp0ohxo,t1_fp0c8h7,1588213467.0,"I understand that and I know that is similar with a lot of teachers that are doing e-learning. I think the thing to keep in mind is that teachers know that students are not learning with the way it is set up now....However, that is just what situation is. No one could have been prepared for this. Teachers are having to reformat what their classrooms look like now with the way they have been teaching the entire year, which is especially difficult with younger grades. What we do in our classrooms can not be easily translated online. Something like that takes time and preparedness and I believe the teachers I work with are just trying not to overwhelm parents since many families are struggling just to keep food on the table. 

My assumption would be if we continue with online learning next year that teachers will be trained over the summer and there will be a more structured and effective way of learning. Teachers will have time to create systems and work with their schools to come up with ways for students to be more engaged and actually learn. Right now everyone is winging it because that’s the time we were given. In my experience, right now learning new things is not the priority... just being there for families and students has been the goal. 

The difference with next year is that we won’t be in the middle of the school year where students have been doing things a certain way in the classroom and teachers are given a week notice to teach online. Next school year districts will be able to prepare for this different type of learning, utilize programs, and teachers will have a fresh start from day one of how our learning will be different. I just don’t think we can compare how our students are currently learning to how they will learn next year. We might even have some time in the classroom with the students to teach different tools with technology to prepare for e-learning. Obviously these are just my thoughts and we can’t assume we’ll be back in the classroom. However, education must continue unless our society really does fall apart (hope not) and it is no longer priority. If we get to the point where the bar is as low as it is now with education then we should probably just cancel."
Coronavirus,fp08w4p,t1_fp03qdh,1588204679.0,"Hahaha As a kindergarten teacher I laugh at having 125 kids online. Just because you don’t have to worry about physical space does not mean you can put one teacher in charge of teaching 125 five year olds through online learning, this is not a college lecture. Just because something can be done, doesn’t mean it should. E-learning and communicating with not only 125 students but 125 parents and making sure e-learning is helping/effective is not possible. It’s very clear that people who are making these claims have not worked in primary education.


Edit: You also need to keep in mind that the online learning that is happening now is something that teachers had to adjust to within a week time. There was not structure no system in place, no preparation. Teachers have never done this before and are working with what they have at this moment. I can see what you’re saying in that situation but I cannot imagine having a bar so low for the upcoming year. At that point students will just not learn and at that point they should just cancel school."

CoronavirusUS,foss4va,t1_foqxdap,1588036917.0,"Doing class on and off in the building will not be a realistic solution for teachers and families to successfully navigate the school year. Unless there is a consistent plan and structure to follow to go back and fourth, it could be extremely inequitable and ineffective. Especially for the younger students who don’t have that independence piece or a family member who can’t walk them through e-learning. 

A classroom and successful learning is greatly dependent on structures and routines and those things will look completely different in the classroom and online. If schools decide to do that then teachers will need to reformat how they teach in a building to translate similarly to continuing online if they need to transition... and then you have to remember you are working with 5-14 yr olds in elementary schools. Teachers are going to have to reinvent how they teach their students, starting at square one, to be able to go back and fourth. It might just be better to decide one or the other so that teachers can make it meaningful and accessible for all families and students. 

Another idea I had was potentially postponing the start date of school until it was safer and there are clear protocols in place for teaching in person... OR potentially having older students who are more independent continue doing online learning while younger students continue learning in person, utilizing empty classrooms to allow smaller class size and tighter protocols for students who cannot do e learning independently. Just ideas."

Just teaching students to log into educational websites routinely is typically a battle. Some students haven’t even gone to pre-school and their attention span is 15 mins. How would you see that playing out? In my opinions, there is no way to effectively engage students to the point where it is beneficial to students and possible for parents. To be effective these students would need support from parents because they are not independent yet. My thoughts have been pushing off the start date of the year or potentially having early education return to the classroom in smaller class sizes that allow social distancing protocols, adding more teachers. Keeping students who can do independent e-learning at home and new protocols and small class sizes for early ed in the building. They are going to have to get creative with early ed or honestly, I don’t understand how this will be effective."

It will be hard in the beginning but will pay off if done consistently. You can use a visual timer to help them understand these limits. I would recommend investing in some sand timers. (Very cheap online) You can get these for all different lengths of time. You can build a routine that they or you flip the sand timer over when he’s earned screen time and that it goes away when the sand goes all the way down. Again, could be tricky for a 3 year old but if done repeatedly with the same language it could be successful. “Wow, let’s see how much sand is left. Oh, looks like time is almost up. Etc.” With younger children it’s hard to teach consequences/rewards because it needs to be immediate, so bedtime could be tricky to teach this. During the day, however, I would make sure that if there is extreme whining or behavior that they do not get screen time. This will be difficult in the beginning but if done repeatedly eventually it will sink in and alleviate tantrums. Hmm... if the sand timer doesn’t seem effective for the age then I would just make sure that you have some clear limits enforced with good and bad behavior, as well as potential times through out the day that is for screen time. For instance, maybe when they wake up, they get an hour, middle of the day they get an hour, and before dinner they get an hour. It might help if it isn’t before bedtime.

Coronavirus,fl9xwkw,t1_fl8eti1,1584972124.0,"Mob mentality! Education is there, people just choose what information they want to believe. Our country is so divided that even during a GLOBAL health crisis, people across party lines cannot see clearly. People in the U.S take this as an attack on Republicans, Trump, and the upcoming election. Which is wild because this is happening EVERYWHERE in the world, not just the U.S. Our communities are hurting and people are dying. Yet there are still people praising Trump for his efforts and making this us vs. them. He is the reason this virus has progressed so much and why we are so unprepared and equipped. Our communities are suffering everywhere, rural, urban, rich. Poor... and our neighbors are fighting this battle without weapons, yet people still have the audacity to the praise the person who got us in the position and deny FACTS. VIDEO FOOTAGE. America please come together and be honest with yourself about this matter. It’s not about whose our next president is..."
Coronavirus,fkv9hx4,t1_fkur26w,1584564759.0,"Yeah, Trump really messed up how we responded to this from the beginning. We could have been doing so much more to prepare for this and instead we are taking steps backwards... so far as that now we are still having to convince people that this is a serious (and global) health crisis. In a time where we need unity most, he’s still dividing us! Even in the state of a pandemic he’s worried about saving face."

For preface, I work in a kindergarten classroom in the city of Chicago with 25 students alone. Those tables need to be disinfected all day (bc 5 yr olds are gross) and I need it to be accessible enough for my students to help! If my room isn’t clean, all my students families are at risk.

EDIT: We are off school until the 30th for now but think of other businesses or public programs that are in similar situations and need products like this!"

Coronavirus,fkcgsji,t1_fkcbpne,1584052765.0,"Honestly, just listen to your gut. If you truly don’t think they should go to school bc you don’t want to put others at risk then you should listen to that. Last week I had a kid throw up everywhere and he was back at school the next day!! It’s irresponsible and unfair to my families and their kids. I would call your district and see what their stance is currently with everything happening. They may have changes their view for now."
Coronavirus,fkcggwb,t1_fkccfuc,1584052572.0,"It’s more so people trying to ease my mind, I don’t think it’s the thought that it doesn’t matter if they are sick. 

Being in a kindergarten classroom is basically just a vestibule of germs. I have become “crazy teacher” and have my kids in routine now of disinfecting and sanitizing etc many times through out the day bc they are 5 and they are gross. But then you have the other kindergarten teachers who are like “oh, it’s coming either way. Im not worried about it. It’s mainly older people.” It negates what I’m trying hard to do... keep our community healthy, which is infuriating! We have so many teachers 50+!"
