When I say I CAN'T do something, I.e - I can't go into a room full of people and just be a social butterfly, does not mean that I WON'T. It means I am physically unable to do it because of anxiety / panic etc. I'm sorry I apologize all the time. I'm sorry I am so sensitive that if you even look at me a certain way I start crying. PTSD Is NOT just war related. If you are a veteran, God bless you and thank you for your service. Thank you for fighting in real life wars. What some people don't realize is that people with mental illnesses have their own wars to battle. I am not saying we need to be honored or anything, no no no, But at least don't put us down and say that we are not valid for having PTSD because we never fought. (I've known quite a few veterans who tell me that I am just being a pussy and a liar because they can't see it the way I do. If you are just looking for attention and don't have any issues, please don't go around saying you wanna die and stuff. It makes it harder for us who actually need help. If someone is self harming / suicidal / acting paranoid etc, don't call them stupid or selfish or anything like that. It doesn't help. Self-harm is an addiction and some people don't realize that. We also can't just ""Be Happy"" on a whim. Trust me, if it were that simple we wouldn't have issues. Please be kind and patient with us. Most importantly, if you don't understand, ask. Thanks.

So I slapped her on the back of the head as hard as I could and when she turned around screaming in pain asking ""What was that for?!"" I was like ""Oh, sorry, you said you couldn't feel pain...""

abuse,f239uoe,t3_dbl0b7,1569912528.0,"(This is my personal experience, not every person reacts this way) I had a couple of abusive relationships. As far as her falling prey to it, it's easy to do that. They whisper sweet nothings and pull you in, do something horrible but then something sweet you just cant say no to a guilt trip you. This is an endless cycle. It finally gets to a point where you see nothing but your own fault and they can do no wrong and they are in charge etc. One of them his mom didn't like me so she made him leave me. Another he was basically manipulating not just me but my mom and though I was being physically, emotionally, and sexually abused by him, I didn't care until he called her a bitch. I literally told him he had to leave or I was calling the police (with all the evidence, pictures, videos, sound recordings etc). So he left. Now with your friend, It doesn't seem physically abusive, which is going to be harder convincing her it's actually abuse. Most people think abuse is just physical but it's not. Like the previous comment, sitting them down and telling them how much they've changed, you worry etc might help. But also don't belittle them / call them stupid/ make them feel like an idiot. Even if they are being one. If they feel like that before they're ready to leave, (at least it was this way for me) they won't trust you enough to ask for help and just be stuck. My friends used to call me stupid all the time and so I was like Oh that's what they think of me.. okay.. So I never asked for help. Don't be a broken record. Let her know that you worry and you care and you wish she would make the right decision to stay away from him. BUT You will always be there for her and try to let her do that on her own. Occasional pep talks is okay, but if you're depressed and you hear the ""It gets better"" speech, eventually you start to roll your eyes and hate it, this is the same way. If you keep telling her hes bad for her, she needs to leave blah blah blah she's gonna end up pushing everyone away (which, is probably what HE wants). Just, keep reminding her you care and you love her and you don't want her hurt and you'll always be there for her. However, if it DOES get to a really bad point where you can collect evidence and go to the police with it, I urge you to do so. I hope I helped at least a little bit. I'm not the best with words.

The corner had lost the little panel thing so it was just the L shaped bar. I turned on the AC and tripped and it impaled my leg about an inch deep, I didnt feel it at first i just looked down and saw blood and started screaming for him. Finally after a little while of being annoyed bc I didnt go to him, he comes in and sees me frozen looking at my leg and hes like ""OH FUCK"" Luckily he went to nursing school and he cleaned it up the best he could. He wanted me to go to the hospital but I didnt. it's fine now but shit it hurt so bad. Had to clean it multiple times a day everyday.

abuse,ezz55ya,t3_d32m9j,1568280728.0,"I've been on both ends of this spectrum. I've threatened to kill myself (when I was like.. wayyyy younger, early teens) and have also had S.O's say they'd kill themselves, even friends faked deaths just to get my attention. This might be blunt, but if he was gonna do it, he would have already. If he's planning to do it, no amount of you being in his life is gonna stop him. IF he ends up doing it, it is NOT your fault and he was beyond help. Ignoring him would be the best course of action. When I say ignore him, I mean ignore EVERYTHING. I don't care if it's an ""I'm sorry"" text or w/e. Get a restraining order if he keeps threatening you or your family. But do not answer him or else he will try to weasel his way back in and it could get a lot worse like it did for me. Save yourself, Love. Stay Strong My Darling <3"

Here's a post I made on things that tend to help me, I use most of them on a daily basis and haven't self harmed for 7+ years. I still think about it sometimes but never act on it. Hopefully SOMETHING in here can help him? If not, just be there for him and try to understand that self harming is an addictive tendancy since it literally has a chemical reaction in your body. It's hard to stop and the person has to want to stop. Sadly, You can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped but maybe if you explain how much it hurts you to see him like this and wish he would stop bc you care about him so much etc? I would say check out for certain Items, but I fear that would only make him feel babied and back him into even more of a corner. So for now just be there for him, hope that he wants to stop and should you ever need an ear or he does, you can always DM me. I'd def like to know if any of these helped so keep me updated :3 Stay Strong My Darlings! <3"

I made this post and constantly send it to people I think could benefit from it. I'ts okay to relapse, it happens. However, it's starting over and trying to stop again that's important.
