Seek out support with this... talk to your guidance counselor  (if they're any good, some aren't), ask your local librarian, go on Reddit Canadian college or scholarship groups, etc. Just start searching using out of the box terms like 'scholarships children of alcoholics', or 'hockey scholarships', 'budding writer scholarships', or whatever you can think of. From what I've heard,  Canada funds college pretty well for its citizens. College in the US is crazy expensive, i.e. 30k per year for an in-state school, up to 80k per year for privates.   Maybe take a few classes in a local college first in the evening just to get into the college mindset? 

In saying this though, trades are also great so don't rule that out.

Btw, read the book 'This Naked Mind', lots of us on here have read it, it will open up your mind to what alcohol really is - a harmful poison that slowly destroys you.  I also just read a book called 'Maid' about how a poor young single mom with no supports put herself through college working as a maid- she's now a New York Times bestseller! Read inspiring books like this.  Think big and you'll do big things! This post is a really good start, it means you're already questioning the lifestyle you and your pals have which is hard to do at 16 when peer pressure is absolutely huge.  I remember, I was getting rat-arsed at that age too because all my mates did it (and I loved being drunk)- just on weekend mind you. There's something very interesting about your writing style that has obviously attracted lots of people to your post, maybe go with that? Take some creative writing classes? Sometimes it's experiences in themselves that open doors for you because of the connections you make. 

Good luck, I'm sure you'll do well in life,  just start by chucking that vodka!"
stopdrinking,f2r85do,t3_de2vc3,1570370657.0,"I have an 18 year old son who had a tough couple of years from about 15 to 17 (he's very lucky to have support and opportunities and I think he's realizing that now). So your post really spoke to me as a mom. 

First, you sound highly intelligent and mature beyond your years -  your writing skills are really great. The fact that you're questioning the status quo at only 16 and have posted this on Reddit shows that too. And btw, a couple of Bs and Cs aren't a huge deal, I'm very sure you will still get a scholarship. 

You have two paths you can choose right now and you're the only one who can make this decision:

Path 1: Continue drinking, spiral into a life of addiction, sadness, loss of hope,  bad health, mental health issues,  have a hard time holding down a job,  hurt people in your life because of the dysfunction, etc. Then die young from liver disease or some other alcohol-related condition. That's what will happen if you continue on this path. Or some similar variation of that. 

Path 2: Quit the drinking now and move into your future clear-minded and strong. It will be hard at first but you're young so it will be much much easier for you.  It's much tougher to quit after decades of habits and neural pathways have been formed. Instead of spending your nights in oblivion, put all your energy into plans for your future. Get support - speak to teachers,  community leaders,  google scholarships, write essays for college,  etc. Work and save. Go to community college part- time and keep great grades so you qualify for scholarships for 4 year colleges. Or, look for apprenticeship opportunities in trades,  starting at the bottom and working your way up.  Do everything you can to get out of dodge. Lots of people with intelligence and ambition have got themselves out of much worse situations. 

As for your friends,  make up some story that will satisfy them as to why you're not drinking. Tell them you've become allergic or that it upsets your stomach too much.  Or tell them that you want to save some brain cells. 

Again, the fact that you're sitting here on this sub writing such an eloquent post shows that you're unique, smart, mature, and ambitious.. You only have one life ma dear, don't throw it away. You can break this cycle."

stopdrinking,f1buxtv,t3_d8jgs1,1569343536.0,"You remind me of myself. I'm 52. I partied hard as a teen and student - lots of night-time binge drinking - this was totally normal at the time. I then slowed down my binge drinking after graduating at 23 but would typically get somewhat drunk or tipsy most weekend nights for the next 30 years. About 10 years ago I started drinking almost every night - not getting drunk often, but tipsy most nights and I saw my alcohol intake slowly increase. I loved the strong IPAs. I still managed to function normally though - responsible single mother, daughter, employee, neighbor, etc. I started to have issues with anxiety on and off over these years and had a terrible attack a couple of years ago - almost a full breakdown. I found that alcohol gave me a temporary escape but over the last year I would wake up in pure and utter panic at night thinking about the damage I had done to my internal organs. My anxiety over this became so bad that it eventually overtook my desire to drink and I now - unbelievably - have little desire to drink. The alcohol induced anxiety is so aversive to me now.  I still have on and off GAD - I get triggered by certain events (health related, kids, etc.) and am using the following to address this - kava tea in moderation, lavender oil at night,  meditation, exercise, deep breathing, and omega-3 supplements.  I also use marijuana-derived CBD at night to help me sleep. This all might sound hokey but, combined, it really does work - and all of these strategies are supported by empirical research. For example,  exercise and meditation have been shown to shrink the amygdala (responsible for the flight or fright response). I'm a very practical person, an atheist, and am not at all into self-help books,  astrology, etc.  But I do know that there are natural ways to address the anxiety that really do work. I tried Zoloft once but couldn't put up with the gastrointestinal issues. Plus, research shows that these SSRIs are not that effective. 

Good luck! You'll feel much better when you get booze out of your life.... if your incorporate these strategies."

The point is that if you did do some permanent 'damage'  (which I believe is unlikely)  there's nothing you can do about it now,  just continue to steer clear of the booze!
