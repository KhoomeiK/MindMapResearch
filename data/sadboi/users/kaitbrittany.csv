Just walking around on roach with all HUD turned off enjoying the immersive environment and beautiful sunsets and sunrises

I really think it’s saved me from doing bad and self destructive things as a sufferer of BPD and Bipolar"

BPD,f5qzl3i,t3_dorsg8,1572385679.0,"Yes, I get obsessed with someone and want to do everything with them. For a short period of time, as soon as I feel as tho they like me more or even just like me and want something more serious I instantly stop caring about them completely and want to be left alone entirely, I feel horrible because I know it hurts people but I can’t control it and forcing myself to go along even tho I feel that way is super triggering. So I have made a promise to myself to not get involved with other people with any hopes of it being more than a temporary fling. I just hurt people."

BipolarReddit,f4iexy2,t3_dknoq8,1571603159.0,"Andrew yang could be good
Edit: maybe not, sorry. Either way, I hope for the best with America it seems like a scary place to live. Society wasn’t made to work for those who’s disabilities / mental illness prevent them from participating at the same rate in this rat race. It’s disheartening and I feel for everyone who struggles with this. I know what it like. I am lucky in NZ it’s lengths better than America (although still not great)"

My favourite in the city is from flight coffee hanger. Agreed Havana is a nice brand, the baristas are what either brings that out or not though.

PewdiepieSubmissions,f3wmqhh,t3_dihvh5,1571209444.0,I don’t believe mental illness and struggle should be a competition between men and women. We both have our different struggles both are just as bad in different ways. Let’s just try and understand and help eachother.
AskReddit,f3ssoer,t1_f3rpd2s,1571108488.0,My brother and I in very similar situation. Raised JW both hate it deeply and mother barely acknowledges us and if she does it comes across as if she’s feeling guilty for doing so. It’s messed up
