He should have talked this out like an adult or just gotten a divorce, not this long played out game using his child like a toy for his own sick revenge."
relationship_advice,et93677,t3_ca66sv,1562583818.0,"Jesus OP. No offence, but both of your parents are shitholes. Your mother cheated. Your father is pulling some petty shit like a child would because he's upset, and that's wrong. He should have talked this out 18 years ago. Both are in the wrong for not telling you until you turned 18. Your father should have moved on or gotten a divorce 18 years ago, if he's willing to do this to someone he spent 18 years raising and pretending to be the dad of, just so he could get some petty revenge, I'm honestly worried what he would do to anybody else out of spite if they did anything. This relationship can't be repaired or patched back together, it was built on lies and was only fabricated so that your father could get some little kick out of finally getting his revenge. That's fucked. You don't need that nor do you deserve that in your life. Full honesty if I were you, I would never be able to forgive him, but maybe you're more forgiving than I am.
Talk to your siblings. Tell them what he's done.
Honestly if I were them, I wouldnt be able to look your father in the eyes because of the shitty fucking thing he's done."
