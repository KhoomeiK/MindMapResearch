Currently drinking beer, alone. Saw my brother earlier for a while, but I have no feelings about it whatsoever. It was just a formality to me.
I just wanna isolate myself and fucking die.
I'm so god damn tired, and new years eve is coming as well. 
Just fucking end this pain."

Effexor,fbxdour,t3_eeye1w,1577181890.0,"I was recently switched from 375mg effexor to 120mg cymbalta, and while I didn't experience any major side effects apart from dry mouth, it didn't actually help either, so the next time I'm seeing my psychiatrist probably will be switched to something else. I'm also on 15mg Abilify and use either ambien or serouquel to sleep.
As far as I know, Effexor and Cymbalta are both SNRI-s, so switching to cymbalta might work on your case. Every person is different, it might be just what you need. It just so happened that it did nothing for me, but maybe it will to you."

depression,evtfgn2,t3_ckyuve,1564769258.0,"For me all mornings are the same, I wake up, eat breakfast, and go to work. I feel like I'm on autopilot at this time, it's always the same and I dont feel pretty much anything at all. After lunch though, everything is always different. Some days it ends up being alright I guess, but every once in a while it ends up in misery, and it it does, it gets worse by the evening always. I really know what you feel, but I've never been able to put it in correct words. Those days I think the best is to fall asleep early and as fast as possible, just to escape those feelings."

antidepressants,eoo00vv,t3_bsji4l,1558725832.0,"I do not know for certain, but I'm pretty sure if it stops working at max dose, you'll just be moving on to a different AD, and start again I guess. 
Also no, the 6 month mark is not a maximum, if it works, you should probably take it for longer. Most people are on the same AD for years, because it works well for them.
Good questions btw, I have also wondered what would happen if my high dosage of Effexor (375mg + 7,5mg abilify) once stopped working. I'm pretty sure it's just going to be a switch to something else though."
