dating_advice,fb3i8z4,t1_fb3hsr8,1576474009.0,"I appreciate you saying that because, to be honest, I could definitely work on picking the types of people I go on dates with. If I truly work on that maybe I'll be met with less conflict. Thank you so much!"

Virginity,fb3f2zk,t3_eb135e,1576471337.0,"It's important to address your own feelings about the situation first. I wouldn't say you fucked up, but regardless if you find the girl ugly doesn't mean her privacy shouldn't be respected as well. As for your friends, I would wait to talk to them at all until you sorted your own thoughts out. It's not the end of the world, this can simply be a life lesson. Wish you the best!"

When that happens I try and understand that those ideas are just ideas and not to let them consume my mind, I let the idea come up then I let it pass, a way of relinquishing control of negative emotions. I hope you get help, so you can live your life for you. Much love to you"
