politics,fr0two9,t1_fr0jk7a,1589806634.0,"History hasn’t been decided yet. When this is over (please), history will have no choice but to look at other presidents from the era... 

Like Obama or not, his chapter will be very different than the current president.

Trump -will be an example of when checks and balances fail, nepotism, gaslighting/dog whistling, how to create a depression, tweeting instead of attending funerals, an inability to show remorse/comfort, total lack of accountability, not showing your taxes and the implications of unknown debt and bad dealings, the most corrupt AG/Sec of Treasury/Sec of State/ whatever Larry kudlow does (besides the white stuff) we’ve ever seen and finally destruction of norms like a  pres rage tweeting all day after getting to work at noon. Followed by more tweets and watching a fake news channel.

Never thought I’d see the day where anyone had a worse stretch of unpopularity than George W Bush after Katrina and sitting for 8 mins reading after being told of 9/11 . In fact the period right after 9/11 saved some of his reputation. He really had an impact at the sites. My buddy is with a Union  that was helping clear away the fallen buildings (not a conservative bone in his body) and he said Bush’s visit still gives him chills..
Think many of us recall this;
      The president, who had been in office less than eight months, grabbed a bullhorn and started thanking the fire fighters and other first responders at the scene, telling them that they were in the country's prayers. Someone in the crowd shouted that he couldn't hear the president, and Bush replied with the words that made history.

               “I can hear you!"" he declared. ""The rest of the world hears you! And the people – and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon."" The crowd reacted with loud, prolonged chants of ""USA! USA!""

             In this electric moment, Bush captured the mood of the country, delivering just what the American people wanted a combination of gratitude for the rescue workers' bravery and diligence, defiance toward the terrorists, and resolve to bring the evil doers to justice”.

            His unpopularity at that point as a pres wasn’t good but he was able to make something of it by showing  he was EMPATHETIC, a word trump has yet to show any. 90K dead and I’m yet to hear anything resembling a “buck stops here” type of accountability....

Instead we get “blame them, blame him but don’t blame me...this was def not my fault”. That’s not the point, go be presidential and comfort those who lost family members without seeing them a final time or having a memorial. 
Show you care at all about anything but the stock market, economy and bad mouthing things/people who had nothing to with this. Blaming Obama when you disbanded the pandemic team and pulled funding Is YOUR FAULT since YOU CHOSE TO DO IT. 

Again I’d rather be  quoting Bill Clinton stories but the point was that an unpopular pres seen at moment as weak, incapable of leading, and overwhelmed by the moment should take a lesson from the last bungling president. 

Step up and act like a leader of ALL Americans, not just the ones who fill your rallies and be surprised with the positive outcome.

Of course he will continue to rage tweet and not heed that advice which is why we need a grown up in the White House"

While I agree trump is a product of the party. It’s almost indisputable that he took a burning fire and poured gasoline all over the place. Campaign rallys weren’t hate festivals of the confederate party- it’s almost indistinguishable the difference at a quick glance between a Klan rally and trump rally which is insane. Same hate, same violent presence, same flags,  same shirts, (and btw-the Maga shirts and hats at this point are only worn by those who know damn well what they stand for... and a president who knows exactly what to say/do to incite them) ...kind of like how a large organized group in Virginia carries torches and chants anti-Black , anti-Jewish , and anti-anything not white  resulting in the death of an innocent woman. 
When he didn’t come right out and speak against what happened and delivered his very famous line that will be in the “America’s worst president” chapter of future textbooks.
“There are very fine people on both sides” will never be forgotten. That’s what  makes him worse than the party at this point. Kids in cages, racist immigration policies, mobilizing ICE, stealing from poor to give to rich companies/his buddies , stealing other countries medical orders because America is last and worst in our response to corona, giant tax cut for the Rich that tripled the deficit ( as Republicans screamed for years about dems “making bigger government that will hurt the national debt)
”Ugh what? Now u don’t care? Oh now you do again when iits time to discuss giving Americans more than a one time  $1200 deposit. Canadians get $2k a month that’s waiting for them. Republicans Senators somehow aren’t embarrassed that our one time payment is 800$ less than the monthly amount in Canada. (Canada’s GDP Is almost 20 trillion less than America and yet they hard that ready months ago). 
Side note- spare me the America is where everyone wants to go, even prior to corona., we’ve emerged as a place people were visiting less for fear of customs smh . 

He isn’t the 1st person to think of putting immigrant  kids in cages and all the other awful ideas. He is the first one to actually do it.. it’s what sociopaths do (like not caring about the dead or grieving- just $ ).

As far as stability, that exists as long as the oligarchs allow it to. If Putin doesn’t make them money he doesn’t have a job.

Russia does a really good job making you think  they’re more powerful than they are (they get it from their leader).
Putin would have you believe they are a world leader yet aren’t even a top ten GDP country.

Putin basically serves at the mercy of the oligarchs who will keep him in power as long as the system is working for them. 

What are the largest economies in the world?
Just off this list you know the US is at least 20 trillion more. That’s T like trillion. 

Top ten

United States (GDP: 20.49 trillion)
China (GDP: 13.4 trillion)
Japan: (GDP: 4.97 trillion)
Germany: (GDP: 4.00 trillion)
United Kingdom: (GDP: 2.83 trillion)
France: (GDP: 2.78 trillion)
India: (GDP: 2.72 trillion)
Italy: (GDP: 2.07 trillion)
Brazil: (GDP: 1.87 trillion)
Canada: (GDP: 1.71 trillion)

I understand that nuclear weapons means power but it was basically understood after the Cuban missile crisis that as long as BOTH countries have  the capability, it’s “mutually assured death” if a country fires. Automatic detection, ours launch and everybody’s dead so not a viable option.

The oil fight, Ukraine, working w other dictators, making loans to real estate developers who want to build in Moscow🙄....could name another 100 attempts at showing or gaining power that mostly failed. 

The truth is Chernobyl removed them from that status and they’ve never gotten back there. A major world crises handled horribly that jeopardizes other nations is probably the fastest way to do it. 

It shows how one bad leader, could destroy an entire country’s reputation and the way they are viewed by the rest of the world  (for example if your leader suggests dead seriously to inject Lysol prob not much coming back from that). 

When a leader doesn’t respect allies going back hundreds of years, makes friends w known dictators, has people w no experience or intelligence (just related to him) as advisors since the professionals were fired or left.

NYGiants,fof9crc,t1_foew9h6,1587730238.0,"I know until the season starts all we can do is speculate but just to give a point or reference because I keep seeing Flowers come up. 

This is the opposite of that. 
If there was no combine and players judged exclusively for their game tape, at the end of the season he was easily #1 tackle on most boards. Then Wirfs and Becton flew and Willis looked outstanding at combine...it became more of a “what do you need now”. 

Thomas was the most complete and had proved he can play left tackle at a high level. Wirfs May end up at guard, and they have no idea if Willis can play LT in the NFL (huge upside sure) but Thomas was most  ready from day one to be an impact player 

Here’s Flowers weaknesses from scouting reports - what really stands out besides everything lol 😂 is “he’s a developmental project”. 
Signs were always there he wasn’t going to work out.

Hope this helps alleviate some concerns about any comparison b/w Thomas and Flowers

WEAKNESSES

“Hand and base technique need work as Flowers moves into the NFL. When asked to stand up and punch at pass-rushers, he doesn't make impact with power. His size doesn't match up to his play strength, especially as a puncher, and too often his length fails to make a difference. He has a tendency to duck his head and lean into defenders. When mirroring a pass-rusher, he'll keep his feet moving and often gives up depth by doing this instead of anchoring to meet the pass-rusher.

Flowers gets caught grabbing and will get handsy when speed gets him off his spot on the outside. He struggles when met with length and speed and gets walked back by power when countered. He's a DEVELOPMENTAL PROJECT who will likely be asked to start his career at right tackle”

Should have never have drafted that guy..period."

Lol 😂

One side question.. if Stewart(I think Stu-  guy who pushed the button and “killed” them.... 
If he did that because the machine was bad for the world, dangerous, etc.. he failed at that right? When Katie alludes to the machine “staying on” , and the fact Lily and Forest are actually in the sim, isn’t the machine still functioning?

I understand he eliminated Forest from reality who he know is a fanatic and crazy but can’t the machine be fixed? Heck, they already built a bridge to it where the electromagnetic used to float across to the machine..
