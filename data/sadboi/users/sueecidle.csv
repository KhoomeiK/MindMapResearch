antidepressants,fougybt,t1_fougavn,1588083873.0,I‚Äôm so glad it‚Äôs working out well enough for you! Gives me some hope after reading lots of horror stories. I hope the rest of your journey gets better from hereü•∞
antidepressants,fouf6eo,t1_fouezi2,1588082904.0,How was Zoloft like for you? Did you experience other weird side effects?
antidepressants,fouf4zy,t1_forn9jm,1588082882.0,"Did you try anything else? If so, did it work better for you?"
antidepressants,fou62ex,t1_fost3sg,1588077156.0,"Hey. I have asked, and he refuses to up my dose as he‚Äôs ‚Äúafraid‚Äù. Told me to wait for my psych appointment at the hospital which is in a few days. And yeah, I think I do feel worse. I was warned that I might ‚Äúfeel worse before feeling better‚Äù but this feels.. too long. Thought it was supposed to only be for a week or two."
intrusivethoughts,foobbyz,t1_foiv06v,1587935976.0,This is so helpful. Appreciate you so much taking the time to explain this.
antidepressants,fon4zma,t1_fon4ssz,1587912354.0,Maybe not for now. It‚Äôs particularly challenging. Hope you still find some form of relief soon though. Stay safe okay. x
antidepressants,fon4p3f,t1_fomtncq,1587912167.0,"Hey there, please talk to your doctor about this. I hope you find some relief soon. *hugs*"
prozac,fomh61r,t3_g8aa99,1587889855.0,"Yes! That would help a lot of people, me included :)"
mentalillness,fojlv8n,t1_fojdir2,1587824223.0,Borderline personality disorder yes :)
prozac,foiyp98,t3_g7pj1z,1587801647.0,"Me too. I have had irregular periods all my life but when I started taking Prozac, the cycles became much longer (last was 4 months, yikes). I‚Äôll talk to my doctor about it. I‚Äôm worried as well, I want cute babies in the future lol"
prozac,foigj5n,t3_g7j0rh,1587786118.0,"Hey, yeah unfortunately it‚Äôs from Prozac :( i‚Äôve been taking it for quite some time, used to be pretty irregular with it and i began bingeing after being off of it. Now that I‚Äôm on it again, my appetite has been really whack. Just no desire to eat, like you mentioned. Although I do know I have to eat as my job demands a lot of physical energy. I will talk to my doctor about it soon and I hope you do too! In the meantime, stay safe :)"
depression,fohhbod,t3_g0fu2t,1587765991.0,"Hey there. I‚Äôve had the same side effects while on my first few weeks of taking Prozac. I‚Äôve learnt that it‚Äôs because the drug is an SSRI, so it works on serotonin receptors all around the body, not only the brain. One other location it‚Äôs at is the GI system. Hence, the nausea, vomiting and other GI discomforts. It went away after about 3 weeks or so, although my appetite only started to improve way after. 

I would still definitely talk to my doctor about it though! He told me to ride it out for a bit and I did. It got better. Although, there may be other solutions for you :) stay safe, cheers"
antidepressants,foffzxu,t3_g77t3g,1587735047.0,All the best! Hopefully you‚Äôll feel some form of relief from it. Do keep us all updated. Sending you my (safe distancing) hug xx
antidepressants,fnuudts,t1_fnuubye,1587271330.0,You too!üåû
antidepressants,fnut7pv,t1_fnusdd0,1587270453.0,True. Definitely wouldn‚Äôt want a mouth feeling like sahara desert hahaha. Hope it goes well ya! Do update. Take care!
antidepressants,fnuoukc,t3_g3yt3s,1587267306.0,"Hi. Sertraline is best taken at the beginning of your day if taken for depression as it helps to ‚Äògive you energy‚Äô and Quetiapine (the higher dose) at night as it helps you to sleep if taken for insomnia. Taking them at the same time may cause a ‚Äòclash‚Äô in terms of how they‚Äôre supposed to work. Positive with negative. As for Ramadhan, I understand as I‚Äôm a Muslim as well. I guess I would take my morning doses with sahur and night doses at iftar or before sleeping (please reconfirm with your doctor, he might have other suggestions) Hope this helps!"
antidepressants,fnuoesl,t3_g3z9w7,1587266993.0,"Hi, I suggest that she goes back to the doctor that prescribed her the SSRIs before and tell him/her how she‚Äôs feeling right now. If the appointment takes too long, visiting another GP would be an alternative. If she is extremely suicidal, the ER might be a better pick (depends on her, actually). Hope all is well. x"
depression,fnsv1aa,t1_fnsavkh,1587229330.0,"That sounds like psychotherapy or cognitive behavioural therapy. I have heard that some people benefit from just that, or that plus medications. I have yet to try that though, maybe I‚Äôll give it a try soon. Thank you! Appreciate the reply. Stay well x"
antidepressants,fnsozcl,t1_fnsohcr,1587226021.0,"Yes I‚Äôve heard of it. My friend is currently trying that out, on 150mg, sadly it gives her the worst insomnia ever. I‚Äôve tried Amitriptyline (the worst) and Fluoxetine (seems to be ok but not as good as it should be)"
antidepressants,fnsj2nt,t1_fnsiqtu,1587222659.0,Ahh I see. What medication is that specifically? I do hope you get to clarify with your psychiatrist and that he or she is able to address your concerns. xx
antidepressants,fns46fo,t3_g3krmp,1587212091.0,What side effects did you have from taking them that you do not want to take them again?
prozac,fns34vy,t3_g1v66r,1587211136.0,"I was on 40mg and it helped with my appetite, although I was still pretty much an insomniac. However, I became taking it irregularly and I‚Äôm now on a (re)starting dose of 20mg (until the next appointment). Haven‚Äôt been doing well though, my sleep schedule is all over the place, my appetite has only been going down and I have increased thoughts of self harm. The upside is that I have a little more energy than before I restarted my regime. I am now able to wake up and shower without having to persuade myself and dragging my ass out of bed (still happens, but not as much).

My side effects include weirdly vivid dreams though. Weird but cool. I can remember every detail. I once had one where I was in a warzone and fighting my enemies and my ex tinder date was having a concert on the side. Dope.

Also, I‚Äôm frequently thirsty. I drink about 3-4L of water these days lol. Not sure if it‚Äôs just me out of a depressive episode, where I don‚Äôt eat or drink.

Edit: I take my meds in the morning/afternoon as taking it at night causes me to have an increased difficulty in falling asleep."
