I in no way have any right to tell you this but you really need to get away from this person as soon as humanly possible (safely). Your period is 100% normal and accidents can happen, but his reaction is pretty vile and 1000 times more disgusting than any period blood on your sheets. I‚Äôve had many incidents like this with past girlfriends. I would get it on my hands and fingers if we were intimate and we did not realize it was that time. It‚Äôs totally normal and I personally cannot fathom how any man can have that reaction. Being a bit grossed out is fine as it‚Äôs still bodily fluids, but a quick wash and a good laugh is the appropriate reaction to this. Please make yourself the priority as he has not shown any respect for you with his idiotic and asinine reaction."

Anxiety,feh7ler,t1_feh07be,1579110809.0,"Oh don‚Äôt get me wrong. I think you should have a place to vent and do appreciate you adding the triggering warnings. I don‚Äôt get triggered any longer so I‚Äôm not talking about me personally, but you are ranting on a very public forum so you‚Äôre going to get advice whether you want it or not. It kind of comes with the territory. My concern is that there are people looking for a reason to give up that may read your rant even with the trigger warning. I‚Äôm sure you know as well as anyone how that hopelessness can consume you. My philosophy is that hope, as well as hopelessness, are contagious. So why not just spread hope? Not that I‚Äôm a fountain of hope myself, but i have really noticed a change in myself since I stopped the hopeless talk in my head as well as outwardly. Your points and feelings are valid as I mentioned. I‚Äôm really not trying to argue that with you. Just want other people that may read this thread and comments to know that sometimes things don‚Äôt work for some people but it doesn‚Äôt mean you lose hope that it can work for you. Whatever it is. Again I want to assure you that I have nothing but your best interest in mind. I just also have the best interest of others that may be reading your rant in mind as well.  It‚Äôs a fucked up situation to deal with this crap we go through daily. I feel like everyone who deals with this is close to me as we are the only ones that ‚Äúknow‚Äù  and can understand the pain we all feel. So I just try to make sure that others understand that one person‚Äôs struggle with that pain is not the end of their efforts to combat and accept their own pain. It‚Äôs a lifelong journey on an individual basis for everyone. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Anxiety,fegztj4,t3_eoxhbw,1579106163.0,"I 100% empathize that mindfulness has not worked for you, but I think the foundational issue may be that you are looking for a ‚Äúcure.‚Äù What mindfulness has helped me with is that it has made me come to terms with the fact that I suffer from anxiety and there may not be a cure. I suffer from PTSD and severe depression (war + multiple traumas). There is no pill, no book, and no guru that will magically make these feelings go away. Mindfulness has helped me come to terms with this and get to a place of acceptance. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it still fucking sucks most of the time, but sitting with it and staring it dead in the face has definitely taken the edge off. 

Everyone‚Äôs story is different though and I totally feel that frustration you are conveying here. The people that tell you to try harder are not helping at all. Your venting is totally valid, but if I could give you a bit of advice, mindfulness IS working for some people so denigrating it because it‚Äôs not working for you is just as bad as people telling you it‚Äôs working for them and you need to try harder. In fact your position is more damaging as it can make people who are making progress slip back into the hell you are saying mindfulness is not helping you get past. Just my  2 cents. I wish you all the best and hope you do find the thing(s) that can help take the edge off."
Anxiety,f1pk4ez,t3_dagmma,1569682466.0,"I wouldn‚Äôt talk to your parents about your anxiety. If they are dismissive then they obviously don‚Äôt understand nor want to understand what you‚Äôre going through. Not saying they are bad people. It may be they just cannot empathize or it‚Äôs hard for them to understand. It may also be very difficult for them to see you are suffering and this is a defense mechanism for them. 

You‚Äôre best bet is to help yourself. Find a therapist and get into habits that will help you deal with your anxiety. You‚Äôre completely in charge of how you handle your life issues. All your parents can do is be supportive. If they cannot be supportive, then the option to help yourself is still completely open and up to you. Once you are better you can educate them on how they could have better handled the situation. :)

Best of luck! You‚Äôre worthy of anything you want in this life. Especially peace of mind."

All they did was lose out on some tax revenue and add 15 minutes to the commute for anyone who wants to buy some. I‚Äôve been to Naperville so this is not a huge surprise, but it‚Äôs really a lose-lose for them like you mentioned. It‚Äôs a bunch of older generation folks who watched reefer madness and took it seriously."
Anxiety,ewdzbon,t3_cnmz0o,1565310920.0,"100% feel you on this. If I break REM sleep for even a split second, the thought cycles will rush in and I‚Äôm awake. I have gotten a decent handle on it, although I still have some days. 

What has helped me is to first wear ear plugs when I sleep. It was kind of weird for me at first but they serve a couple purposes. 

1) They help me not be woken up by any external sounds so I don‚Äôt start the cycle. 

2) Most importantly, when I have them in I can hear myself breathing and very little else. This is key. If I do wake up and the thoughts start, I just focus on the loudest thing I hear. My breathing. I then imagine that there is a steep skateboard ramp coming out the top of my brain and I shoot all those thoughts into space as they flood in and try to cycle. I smile at them as they pass by and shoot up. I‚Äôm usually back to sleep in about 20 minutes. I basically meditate myself to sleep. :)

By no means will this work for everyone and it takes some practice. I meditate every day so I can get into that state much quicker if I happen to wake up. Like everything in life, it takes practice. 

Wishing you more restful nights friend. Sleep os key to good mental health. Stay strong, lean into it, and never give up."
Anxiety,ev9slp4,t3_cisaz1,1564330208.0,"I can totally relate and this is totally common. Not sure how old you are but as I have gotten older (40 yrs old now), I have begun to obsess much less. For me, it took coming to the realization that there is literally nothing you can do about death. It‚Äôs inevitable and obsessing over it only makes the time you do have on this earth miserable. Why waste the time you do have? Just enjoy your time, live it fully with kindness and when death comes, our bodies have mechanisms built in to deal with that last moment.

It‚Äôs completely normal to worry about death, but letting it ruin your life is not normal. I recommend starting or continuing to speak with a therapist about it. It helped me tons to have another person look me in the eyes and say we are all going die. It‚Äôs not easy to come to terms with but honestly your only other choice is to obsess about it till you actually die.

Sending you tons of positivity and wish you all the best. We‚Äôre all on the same ride my friend. Throw up your hands and enjoy the rollercoaster. :)"
Anxiety,esj29e9,t3_c819cv,1562024647.0,"You don‚Äôt need anyone to love but yourself. Once you get that going the realizations will hit. All we will ever need or have is ourselves. Everything else is just some nice extras that come along along for the ride. 

Expectations are poison. Stay away from them. Just my two cents. Stay strong and all the best friend."
Anxiety,eqqktw0,t3_bz3zor,1560223647.0,"Let‚Äôs go to the worst case scenario. You go in there and quit and your boss goes completely ape on you. It doesn‚Äôt matter. You‚Äôre out of there. There is a very tiny chance of this happening of course, but in either a best or worst case scenario, just be an adult, thank them for the opportunity and be on your way. You don‚Äôt owe anyone anything. It‚Äôs your life, your time, your decision. People quit jobs or are fired every day. It sucks and can be scary, but it‚Äôs a totally routine part of life. You‚Äôll be fine. Lean into whatever happens."
