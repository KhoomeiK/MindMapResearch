She had a job, had lots of friends, a good family and gave me overall a good picture. I was very nervous because I really didn’t want to fuck this up. She was just so good!
After a few drinks, the beans were spilled all over the place. Idk how we got there but suddenly we were so deep into conversations about our eating disorders, and going to clinics and hospitals, anti-depressants, our school-situations and just dark stuff. Too be honest, it felt so good. Like we could understand each other and just get it.
We’re having sandwiches this week, a second date!! She sends me songs and tells me I’m cute and it feels great. Maybe it won’t last too long. Maybe we won’t even be together. Or maybe we’ll marry!
I think it’s about clicking with someone, and if you’re a bit off and not ‘normal’, the people who’s going to think you’re rad and great are probably people who might be a bit broken too. To be honest, I really do think it’s hard to find someone truly normal and healthy in this day and age. Maybe even ever. So don’t blame yourself OP!❤️"

I’ve volunteered at two shelters, and lemme tell you: puppies always go, and they go quick. Longest a puppy, was in the two shelters, that I know of, was for about 3 months. His name was Charlie and barked a lot, behaved worse than all the older dogs combined XD Adult and senior dogs can stay for years without people batting an eye, and that’s if it’s a good rescue/shelter. I know of places where they don’t take in dogs over a certain age, and also places where maximum stay is X months.
Get ya elderly puppies guys!!! They are the ones that need you."

Maybe I’m too straight-looking ??
I’m awkward + loves dresses and lipstick. That for many queer women I guess speaks “STRAIGHT GIRL WHO IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE BY ME”. Or I’m just not liked by femmes ? Idk nvm

The girls on the butchy side are a lot more upfront about it if they’re into you, I’ve noticed, and most of the time just goes for it. Probably why the butch+femme never get out of style.
Femme + femme is a rocky place in flirting and dating for I guess it’s always that uncertainty of “are they actually queer”, “am I even their type”, “are they more into masc women” etc. Butch girls just go for it, and if it doesn’t work, it doesn’t, and that’s it.
Femmes gotta step up, all of us."

Not the best dog person for I’m not super dominant but I’d definitely consider smaller dogs or dogs that are older, other than the little guy I have now. I wouldn’t spend the money on the actual animal, like of expensive breeds and stuff, but more on extra things like amazing healthy food, bedding and petbeds and toys and stuff. I’d be so happy, wake up in the morning feed them all, clean out their spaces, maybe go for a ride or a walk with them, give them all pets and cuddles :) It would be the greatest! Maybe I’d even hire someone too to help with the routines, idk. I just would love to fill my house up with cats and little dogs, and have a farm full of ponies and horses and goaties and pigs.
