TherapeuticKetamine,fqud1w9,t1_fqu5qc7,1589656623.0,"My experience by trying to self medicate is that I'm not a doctor and have no idea how it's affecting my brain. I do experience benefits for 1-2 weeks after insufflating approximately an 1/8th of a gram and just enough to sightly disassociate for one day only while not consuming any more than that specific day.

I've used a larger amount and more frequently, meaning a significant amount more than an 1/8th of a gram and more than just one day and I've noticed I do not receive the relief of depression. Each day I use consecutively seems to diminish the effects I feel while using it and the after effects do seem to be a lot less than if I were to use for one day and wait up to two weeks before next use.

This is just my personal experience and I'm not a doctor. But I don't really partake in K as much anymore because the benefits are not as noticable as when I first experienced it. I can get a whole gram, space it out in order to try and help feel the positive effects but it seems to diminish the more it's used.  I don't experience the relief of depression as much as I had initially experienced the first few times I self medicated.

So perhaps self medicating every day has reached it's threshold for you and you're not able to experience the positive benefits because of that. Do you know if it's the same isomer every time you use it? I know there are different types but I seriously have no idea if changing isomers may help in what you're seeking.  This is just my two cents and please do not take this as judgement. Just giving my experiences."

TherapeuticKetamine,fl9uabo,t1_fl9ph3r,1584969453.0,"I could be completely wrong and I am not a health Care professional but from what I understand, people who are prescribed opiate blocking medicines such as Suboxone and Subutex have an increased risk of overdose because of the buprenorphiene (check spelling) that is already bonding to their opiate receptors. In an emergency standpoint, if a person were to be severely injured and taking a medicine such as Suboxone, I believe that administering ketamine as a pain blocker is an alternative for the patient in order to not lower their heart rate substantially. 

Again, I'm not an emergency medical technician, doctor or medical professional. I could be completely wrong, but that's what I have read about because bupe can be an extremely strong opiate and having a patient be in severe pain, the alternative to alleviate the pain, can be ketamine."

You see and interact with different people daily. You see their lives actively going through the motions of the dating cycle and although you've met some that are possibly interested, you cannot act or pursue then because of an ethical standpoint.

You're obviously smart. You're probably attractive to some people. You have the ability to talk with strangers and not express a lack of confidence.

So stop expecting to meet someone and let this hurt your confidence. The more you focus on the part of your mind that thinks ""what's wrong with me"" the more people will subtley pick up on that specific lack of confidence.

You're good at what you do, you're smart and have the ability to attract people. So stop worrying about what's wrong with you and what you need to change. Focus on critiquing your socialization and confidence so when you meet a new lady, you can confidently talk to her without expressing any type of second guessing going through your mind.

I'd say step back and put some distance between you and her. The knew what she was doing when she asked you if you were mad when she hadn't heard from you in 3 days. She wants the attention and she doesn't care about your feelings because she has a guy that she can flirt with until a guy who is ""her type"" comes along. 

I'm just confused as to why she even went on a date with you if you weren't her""type"". I think it's a load of crap and you're being used. Fill up all your time with work or activities so that when she texts you, you'll be too busy to respond and if you get a chance and even feel like responding then you can.

To me, she is a 6-1/2-7 because of this.  She's probably dating someone else and not respecting you by reaching out when she needs attention.  Dating is tough but if you're interested in someone you put effort into, it should flow in return from them.

 This is totally just my perspective though, you have every right to be mad and irritated. If you're still interested in him, let him make the next move and effort to see you. If he's not texting or reaching out to you then you'll have your answer. Don't put any more effort until you receive some in return."
MentalHealthSupport,fanfphb,t3_e9swzj,1576238649.0,"I just started seeing a psychologist who i feel is going to change my life as long as i follow his instructions and homework he gives me each week.

I suffer from pretty much the same problems that you experience, constant judgement, putting myself down, zero confidence, hate myself and cringe at every stupid thing I've ever done.

I'm not a doctor and i am just explaining what he has me practicing but the reason we suffer and treat ourselves this way is because we've trained our brain to think these negative thoughts. It will not change over night and it's going to be uncomfortable and difficult. But the way to address and fix these issues are to find a psychologist who focuses on Cognitive behavioral therapy and positive mindfulness.

We live in the past and create anxiety and negativity thoughts because we are trained to feel this way as a coping mechanism. I've used drugs to mask the problems but the only way to change is to practice being present in the moment. Worrying about if a girl likes you perpetuates the anxiety... You might worry if she's interested, then you might worry you for something wrong, then you might feel you should just spare her the time and end things. And all the while, those thoughts are not true, she actually likes you and it was sabotaged by all those thoughts. But being present and in the moment with her, you'll enjoy the time spent with her, you'll feel confident that she's into you and you might end up with a girlfriend.

That was all just a situation I've thought about because I over think everything and sabotage myself by worrying about the past or future. I don't know if you have resources or access to take to a psychologist/therapist but i can guarantee it'll help you find the tools to overcome all the problems you have. I feel very lucky finding this guy and will spend as long as i can in order to become the man i dream of being. I hope you can get there soon, you deserve to break free from these chains of anxiety and depression."

dating_advice,f9mn1b5,t3_e5yoq0,1575465186.0,"Some great advice i read about when first meeting someone is to set up a quick 15 minute meet and greet. Sure you've text and can hold a conversation, but meeting in person can be different. 

So ask if she'd like to grab a smoothie and meet in person for a brief moment? Only issue is that you have other errands to do and would only be able to meet for 15. 

This gives you both a chance to see if there is an actual spark or if things don't click. If things don't click, you're only obligated to stay for 15 minutes. If you actually do click, then you'll both agree to set up a more formal meet up. It helps both parties deal with the initial ice breaker. It sucks setting up a full on dinner date with a stranger only to find out they are twice the size they really are. 

If she's not down to meet just for 15, she's probably just using the attention you're giving her and it'll go no where."

She might be hung up on her ex. People do things that don't make sense but you may not stand a chance until she gets over her ex. They might get back together, he'll cheat again and it won't make sense. The best thing to do imo is continue to show interest and gauge the amount of effort she puts into you.

They put me on a hold and stated that if I show effort that I'm trying to find a doctor then they'll consider releasing me.  It's a long story and I've realized that when dealing with hospitals and drug addiction, you need to be selective on the words you use.  But you're right, I am not going to tell this doc right now because I've asked about tapering down and was pretty much told it wont even be considered until I have a year or more on them."
suboxone,f7gb99l,t1_f7f7juw,1573699262.0,"I started out at 16 2x a day and instead of taking one in the morning and one at night, i just skipped the next morning dose and took one strip in the afternoon and never took the night time strip. I didn't feel a thing. I'm sure if i really worried about it and tried to see if i felt anything my mind would probably say i am feeling not so good but it's truly mind over matter at this high of dose. 

Now i just try to remember to take one strip daily in the afternoon. About a week ago i forgot to take my dose and it might have been a day or two that i forgot to take it. I started having an anxiety attack out of no where, felt like crap and was thinking i was getting sick. Then it dawned on me that i forgot to take my strip and about 45 minutes after holding the strip/spit in my mouth, i felt almost high. It was euphoric and probably just my body thanking myself for remembering to take my dose but going from 16mg to 8mg was seriously nothing. The only thing is i haven't told my doctor yet and i am afraid to because of all the negative stigma that comes from subs, like people selling them or whatever."
suboxone,f77pjkq,t1_f74ykmy,1573469567.0,"Seriously! Thank you for the words of encouragement and the advice you've given. I do feel that the subs have helped prevent a relapse and I am worried about trying to get off them and then risking a relapse because of something negative or heart wrenching in my life occurring. It's inevitable, like losing a family member, a job or just life. So i really need to find a therapist who can help me figure out how to avoid self medication and absorb the feelings which come along in life. And then taper off. 

I really need someone to guide me once completely clean from subs and everything. Every relapse is from something causing great stress, depression and anxiety. I would always resort to weed to escape but it would start out with a pipe, then multiple joints, then a bong, then dabs and once my tolerance gets super high the self medication with weed isn't enough so I the hardest stuff that my mind knows works. It's almost as if i do it unconsciously, from a third person point of view. I know the consequences, i know what I'm doing and i know using just once will set it off but i it anyways. 

So this time, no weed, no alcohol, nothing psychoactive to avoid dealing with whatever is the issue. I know it's going to be the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but I'd rather learn how to deal with it sober then continue to relapse over and over again. I can't do it on my own because if i could, i wouldn't be talking about it right now.  

I was about to write""I'll do whatever i have to do, in order to prevent a relapse"" but the one thing I don't want is to be chained for years on subs. They are definitely a great tool and something that is helping. But there are still, withdrawals, PAWS and years of recovery to return to sober homeostasis after completely clean from subs. So i rally want to get to that point and have a therapist continue aftercare in order to stay on top of preventing a relapse."

I have been told so many times to just go slow but my mind wants it now. I get jealous from others dedication, i get depressed from the realization of my own procrastination which turns into a cycle of self pity. 


I need to grow the fuck up, take charge of my life and the decisions i make, create a schedule to follow and sick with it. I get these little bouts of actively trying but i never do it longer than a week or two. I'll never forget the feeling of craving the gym but to get there, it takes consistent effort. I just self sabotage, procrastinate, and throw a pity party isolated in my room. 


No one is going to do this shit for me. No one is going to be able to push me every single day, unless i win the lotto but that's not going to happen. Working out sucks the first 2-3 weeks but after that it's seriously the best feeling I've ever had. I had a workout partner which helped but it's all up to me. It's just so easy to say "" I'm starting tomorrow"" then actually getting up, stretching, constantly worrying about form and judgement. That's why i feel i need a therapist to discuss this in the flesh. Your post was inspiring which i think caused my response. Not sure your situation but you're confident, express compassion and that's the type of person i dream to be. I want to see who i am after 2-3 years of being completely clean from any psychoactive substances. I think, actually, i know I'll be different. But that can't be as bad as being a junky loner/loser.

I would like to jump down to 4mg 1x a day but haven't discussed this with my doctor. They think I'm still at 8mg 2x a day. I'm not selling the script or stock piling but i know it might look bad since my doc is a teledoc. I know what i need to do, workout, get therapy, eat healthier, stay away from everything that is psychoactive but it's really hard doing this alone. I don't have a therapist and really want to find one who is focused on addiction but I am so biased with doctors and therapists.

It's pretty interesting how people treat relationships and their partners different than others.  Your first was emotionally abusive so that's a new standard you won't put up with.  I truly find it sexy when I meet a woman, we hit it off and she has no problem telling me what she likes and what she will not put up with.  It's frustrating when I ask what she likes and her response is ""I dunno"".  I hope you can find someone on the same libido level as you are.  I have met a few who could go without it the rest of their lives.  To me that's a deal breaker and I need someone who is going to attack me and know I am going to attack them.

So i would say don't go, work on building confidence and holding your standards and go out and see if you can find someone to flirt with to get your mind off the ex.

It's the way they have confidence in knowing their choices are right for them. Meaning, the girls may not be drooling over him but he makes her feel great herself and finds his confidence attractive."
dating_advice,f3b1ppw,t1_f3b138s,1570799193.0,"Hmm, not sure what that would be about. Maybe trying to enjoy the single life and flirt before he committed. Maybe planting seeds? I'm not too sure to be honest. You might be over thinking it and letting it get to you. Don't sit in these thoughts for too long or you'll start creating false resentments in your head. He can't read your mind so if you're unhappy and you're with him, you should be able to tell him that you have been dwelling on things that probably aren't deal breakers but are still bothering you and you'd like to clear the air so you can not lose trust from these thoughts and messages you saw."
dating_advice,f3b18rv,t3_dgepx8,1570798794.0,She doesn't want to date you but she is interested in hanging out more. If that develops into something she wouldn't be opposed to it. Can you accept the fact that you shouldn't pursue anything romantic for a while or will it get to you?
dating,f3b0cl3,t1_f3b03mg,1570798027.0,"Well i think you're worried about becoming something you're not. These guys who beat women have issues from childhood and need the feeling of dominating and controlling others. I wouldn't worry about it because unless you have some heavy childhood trauma you've never delt with, you should be fine"
dating_advice,f3azsoa,t3_dgehmt,1570797540.0,"I disagree. Because not all woman are female models. Some are thick, some are short, some are tall. Dating is hard and looks are often judged first but getting over this mentality will help you. I've had some women tell me ""you're so hot"" but I'm still insecure and have no confidence. So when they talk to me they realize they want a guy who's confident and sure about the choices he's making. Do it goes no where. So looks aren't everything, it's just what we see."
dating,f3azeb9,t3_dge85l,1570797181.0,"Have you ever used violence when filled with emotion? Like hurt someone or hit them when mad, depressed, or insecure? If it, i think you might be worrying about a fantasy or something. If it excites you or you feel a rush thinking about it, i would speak with a therapist to find more information as to why you're fantasizing about a possible encounter becoming violent. You should want to protect and value your partner. Not hurt them and make them vulnerable. It could be a power thing you need help dealing with. Do you have access to a therapist or psychiatrist?"
dating_advice,f3aymh2,t3_dge52h,1570796462.0,"What makes you feel pretty sure he doesn't feel the same way? Are you giving off the feeling of infatuation? You're acknowledging these thoughts and feelings but second guessing yourself. You could be wrong and he really likes you but is shy. I don't know but I'd say pull back on the feelings for a bit, try to occupy more free time with books or activities which require your attention and don't push things. Don't second guess yourself and end it on your personal"" what ifs""."
dating_advice,f3ay8xp,t3_dge5er,1570796101.0,"The best thing to do, imo, would be to talk with him. Be straight up on how you feel. Is this something you can't get over? Is this something you'd be willing to discuss work on smoothing out your insecurities together with him? It sounds like he was set on you but needed to end things with the others before he committed to you. To me, that's pretty admirable because it might seem like he was searching for sex in your eyes, but i think he might have been ending things. I really don't know though and communication is vital. Don't stew on it and create ideas of ""what ifs"" just talk without accusations."
dating_advice,f362up8,t1_f361epg,1570704351.0,"Oh i know you want to see a look of horror that she got caught but i don't think it'll play out the way you want it to. Sometimes you have to go through it to see what others are saying before you realize that you're better off being the great person you are without the piece of garbage using you for their own emotional support. You're too kind to give her anything more of yourself. That's why i say cut her out. You would never treat her the way she treated you. This wasn't an accident, she knew what she was doing and said ""i love you"" when she was using you for a ride to her boyfriend. She never broke up with him. She just said he was an ex because you had no way of proving they broke up. If any of her friends supported the notion of him being an ex, they were just lying too."
dating_advice,f360e01,t1_f3600g9,1570700993.0,"Severe anxiety might make you overthink things.   I have horrible anxiety but you're worrying about the future and that is something you can't see.  Getting her to your house isn't going to make her feel the same about you.  You want to spend time and be around her, right?  Then just focus on learning what she likes, who she is and what you can do together that will be fun but also comfortable for the both of you.  Your home is your safe haven, but it's not her safe haven.  You might be thinking that you'll feel less anxiety in your safe place, but learn to respect and consider her feelings and make her feel safe by asking where she would like to go."
dating_advice,f3606od,t3_dfvjj2,1570700670.0,"Realize any closure you think you deserve will not come.  You might think she'll change her mind, grovel at your feet for forgiveness and say sorry but she won't.  She was lonely while her boyfriend was in jail.  You were naive and blinded by lust.  The best thing to do is to cut all contact, remove any way of communicating and realize she's trash.  She'll continue to use you.  If you don't think so, you're wrong.  The best revenge is to move on, hold your head up and enjoy life by avoiding people like this.  She didn't fuck up, you did.  Not being mean, I'm just saying you deserve better and you made a mistake by investing 3 months with her.  Invest 6 months into working out and learning how to do something that will benefit your confidence."
dating_advice,f35zvzz,t3_dfv3br,1570700177.0,"Just make an effort to talk to him.  You already know he's seeing someone...  What if he starts messing around with you before ending things with her?  Would you really want that from a partner?  Just get to know him first without any romantic thoughts.  Easier said than done, but just see who he is and acknowledge he has a lady.  If you don't care, then understand that you'll most likely get cheated on as well."
dating_advice,f35zo37,t3_dfv6yn,1570699815.0,"Might be a little too soon to ask for something like that.  She might be asking to meet at the shopping town so that she feels more safe until she knows you're not a murderer.  I'm not saying you are, but respect her desire for safety and just see how things go.  Putting her in a place that she has never been before might feel uneasy.  You know it's safe, but reverse the rolls.  Let's say she lives with her dad who is a military general.  Would you want to go over right away to her place and feel uncomfortable with the thought of dad popping around the corner and snapping you in half for getting close to his precious?"

dating_advice,f2rufit,t3_de4dev,1570376592.0,"Slow your roll. You even went out of your way to capitalize Really. You have to much time on your hands to be thinking about her. You might have already over done it, but just give her some space, stay off social media and do something else that's going to improve a quality you have or desire. Start working out, get a second job, volunteer somewhere. It might sound dumb but infatuation can push others away because they need their space. Keeping busy shows that you don't need her in your life but if you're bored, you'll start creating mind games and it'll give off a sense of desperation to her."
dating_advice,f2roxpy,t3_de4df9,1570375152.0,"Everyone is different. That's why dating is so hard. I personally don't see anything wrong with texting the next day, but it may be portrayed as you have too much time on your hands and are already too much. It's a fine line. But be confident in expressing your feelings. Don't leave get on read. I usually say, got home safe, tonight was fun, I'll text you soon when I'm free to chat. Feel free to hit me up, i might be studying/working but I'll respond as soon as i can. But that's just me. Others may feel different in that approach."
dating_advice,f2rjlwk,t1_f2rfio6,1570373676.0,"You just said it yourself... He was being a Gentle Man. Not a pussy. He's not a mind reader and probably doesn't want to disrespect you, so he played it safe by not forcing anything on you. 

I had time where i was at a girl's apartment, went in for a kiss and she pushed me away and said, we're not doing anything tonight. So i respected that, hung out for a while and went home. I received a text later asking why i didn't take a kiss and fuck her?  I responded with, ""because I'm not a rapist"". It pissed me off because she said no, i heard it loud and clear, yet she wanted me to be the neanderthal ""man"" he's supposed to be. . It's 2019, a man doesn't take or rape.  A man respects and listens to boundaries. He can't read your mind."

dating_advice,f2dwlma,t1_f2cmte9,1570168074.0,"Well, I personally wouldn't focus on asking her about it on the first time meeting.   I am sure it's a sensitive subject for her.  The best thing for you to do is to educate yourself about it.  There is a lot of negative stigma about having it and there isn't a cure.  There are medicines which help prevent outbreaks and I have heard about people contracting it, having one single outbreak and then never having another outbreak ever again.  There are different types and strains.  If you have ever had a cold sore/canker sore in your mouth, that means you have a type of HSV.  Please don't quote me on this but I think there is evidence that everyone has some form of it.  Even if she is not having an outbreak, there is a thing called ""shedding"" or something like that. Which can transfer it to a partner.  

&#x200B;

But please do some research but don't look at her any different than you would a person with diabetes or eczema.  She might have contracted it from birth, from somewhere unknown or from an ex.  But don't ask anything about how she might have gotten it.  That could feel disrespectful to her.  Outbreaks are painful and usually triggered by stress.   I take a supplement called L-Lysine because it helps boost your immune system and can clear up canker sores in like a day or two.  I think most people who have HSV take L-Lysine to prevent outbreaks. 

&#x200B;

Just get to know her and don't focus or think about the HSV.  That will come up in time and it's best to let her take the lead on disclosing any personal information about it.  I never loved a girl so genuinely, never once fought, never had issues other than my own hangup on it.  So I say go for it.  I reacted the way you did when she finally told me.  It was like months before we had sex and whenever I would go to touch her , she would pull my hand away.  I never got mad, but when she disclosed it, I told her it was a deal breaker for me yet we still ended up having sex that night because of the bond we had."

We all have our own different issues and problems but you seriously deserve to be happy. I wish i knew how to help. Have you ever thought about don't something just totally different than you're used to? You might find passion in something you never thought you'd find. I see these people working as a helper on a fishing boat. It can't pay much and it's hard work but they love it and have passion. I wish you and i could find that kind of passion. But you're not worthless. You are unique and so am i. I am the weirdo at work even though no one says it. I wish i was normal but I'm not but then again, i don't want to live their life. It looks boring.  I just don't want to work for 30-40 years only to retire to enjoy like 2 years left of my life. I just wish i could get away and go somewhere and start over. Maybe that's what you need? To start over? Either way, you're not worthless."
dating_advice,f29x8lx,t1_f29vqgm,1570105533.0,"I hear ya, it sucks feeling like they are still looking for someone else while seeing you. Just keep networking and meeting new people. Think of it from a statistic point of view. You need to increase your odds in order to find someone worth while. I always say get a job in retail or a restaurant. You'll make new friends, go to parties, meet more ladies and you'll forget about the ones who treated you like second best."
SuicideWatch,f29wn83,t1_f29vmfk,1570105281.0,I'm so sorry you feel this way. I wish you knew that you deserve to be happy. Life can suck bad and i can only imagine how you feel because I've never been in your situation. But you had a boyfriend so you're obviously attractive so I'm sure you'll find another guy that you'll find happiness in. It just sucks breaking up and feeling lonely. That's where I'm at right now.  You're so young though and you have so much to explore about yourself that it breaks my heart hearing about how much pain you're in.

I'm not saying it's easy but you gotta keep trying. Get back up and keep riding that bike. Don't I've the tires because you fell. Just focus on finding friends. Friends have other friends. Those friends might have vaginas and think you're cute. But if you're giving them the feeling that you resent women, they'll keep a distance from you.  Don't condemn all women because a few disrespected you. Just keep working on you and realize that sex is just sex. But having platonic fun is where you'll find a cool girl."

I could be totally wrong, but maybe he felt uncomfortable with your friends, only wants you to himself and is pouting that he can't just have you all to himself. 

I seriously don't know what his deal is but it sounds like he doesn't even know what he wants. Netflix and chill is cool but does he have any friends or do anything outside of his place? He might be depressed and introverted. Just my two cents."

Don't try and find flaws, just go with the flow, be yourself and absorb the confidence she's giving you. Be humble, confident and don't second guess anything. Especially yourself. She wouldn't put effort into you if she wasn't attracted to you."
dating_advice,f29oiyp,t1_f29mj5x,1570101730.0,"That's awesome! And you should be satisfied. Also continue to make effort though. You're both busy so don't over think it. Give her time, if she doesn't respond you could try and send another message but if she's not putting any effort in you might be wasting time. I met a girl a few weeks ago, she was cute, we flirted but I've made every initiation to have a conversation. Last time we text she said she's busy but the next week she's free. I'm super busy but also haven't heard a word from her since. If she was even remotely interested i would think she would shoot a text saying, hey how have things been? Or something. 

But it's been a week and nothing. Do i continue making all the effort? Ehhh, I'm kind of leaning towards no. Maybe she's waiting for me? She never said when she's free, just free next week. 

So i say, you and i move on and keep being the cool, cute, badasses we are. If they get back to us then cool, but I'm not waiting by the phone. I have a life to live and so do you!"
dating_advice,f29n3p4,t3_dcp731,1570101059.0,"I never dated in high school, i kissed a girl when I was 18 but didn't get a girlfriend until like 20. What i realized is that you need to increase you time spent in places where girls are at. Most girls around 21 are in college or Junior college and need to work a night job in order to be free during the day. I started bussing at a restaurant and found that there are all kinds of girls who serve, bartend, host or work in retail. 

Going on dating apps and to bars doesn't help prove that you're not a random creep. I'm not saying you are by any means. I'm just saying, you need more friends who are female in order to meet more of their friends.  Then you'll be known and trusted instead of being a stranger all the time.

 Looks aren't everything either, it's all about confidence and personality. Are you funny at all? Or serious all the time? Do you put effort into how you're dressed and style your hair? Girls wear makeup and buy clothes that help accentuate certain attributes. Men can do it too, are you?"
dating_advice,f29l28d,t3_dcp4a5,1570100013.0,"I think the healthiest relationship i have ever been in was a girl who has it. I couldn't look past it and was constantly worried about it passing to me. I've never had an outbreak and i possibly have it dormant in my system but we practiced safe sex the whole relationship. I've dated others here and there, girls who i felt were more attractive but not as fun to be with as it was with her. I think i made a mistake by not getting over my issue with it. But it's really a bummer there isn't a cure. There are great medicines that help prevent outbreaks. She only had 1 in the two years we dated and i never even knew about it. But, i never did oral on her which i love to do, she wouldn't let me. Always used a condom which is safe sex practice required to decrease the chance of attracting it which was sometimes frustrating.

I'm thinking she might be busy, might be interested in someone else or just not into you like you are about her. If she hasn't responded, give it since time and if you don't hear from her just keep trying with the ladies. Practice will bring confidence. Thinking there is something wrong with your face isn't confident, but realizing that everyone has different tastes will help you move forward without dwelling too much on the ""what ifs""."
dating_advice,f29j7oz,t3_dcoxfj,1570099083.0,"I've always felt bad for the people who've been dealt a bad hand. Like being short, not attractive, always struggling with weight problems. Actually, that statement sounds pretty naive and rude. But i really do, because this guy has hit the right points in your book except for one and it's not even his fault by choice. Sometimes it takes effort to over come a standard you can't overlook, meaning you might find that although he's short, he really brings happiness into your life. You might pass this guy up and meet someone who isn't short but you might struggle to find happiness because he's only physically attractive. 

The decision is totally up you. You're not a bad person for feeling the way you do. But i do feel bad for the guy because unless he wears platforms, there's not much he can do."

dating,f1z8gs0,t1_f1z676o,1569838279.0,"Well you need to switch from the feeling of being terrible to the feeling of pissed off.  He disrespected you and his girlfriend.  If the other people in your group feel what he did was totally okay, I would try and find a new group.  You're only feeling terrible because you're learning and not experienced yet.  I assume you're in school.  So think about this, when you ride a bike for the first time you fall.  You don't go off jumps, you don't pop wheelies.  You fall.  This was a fall.  So practice more and learn how to ride comfortably.  Then, you'll realize what to do and what not to do.    


You've learned something that is extremely valuable.  It's how you feel.  It sucks.  So now you have to create a standard so that you'll make sure to hold back until you learn who this person is and if they are single.  Having standards are attractive because it means you won't let just anyone touch you.  You're a diamond and a guy should earn your trust.  It takes trial and error as well as time to find another guy to click with.  You seem to be around other guys and girls your age.  Continue meeting new people and networking so that you can realize you're not terrible and that you're just learning."

It felt good to get the romantic attention but don't feel like you want to die, feel mad he used you and your body for his own pleasure.  Be mad and be happy that the next time you run into him, you get to call him a piece of $h!t.  You did nothing wrong other than possibly being a bit naive.  You'll get to cuddle and kiss someone else who respects you so don't dwell on this.  Just forget about him and if you run into his lady, drop a hint he likes to cheat on her.  Don't tell her about you and the situation because she'll either not believe you or blame you.  Also don't go out of your way to find her.  Move on and flirt with someone you know who is single."

I strongly encourage you to seek out a new therapist and put in some effort into finding one that you can feel comfortable with.  I spent a year and a half with my first therapist because I didn't want to offend her by switching to a new one and I thought that I would be starting all over since I had spent so much time and effort going for so long.  I never really progressed and should have made an effort to find someone who I feel is a good fit.  You deserve to express joy and happiness to the people who make an effort to be in your life.  I wish our brains could be adjusted manually in order to move forward from the issues holding us back.  You had a tough time 4 years ago but you survived and are still a great person.  I really hope you can see that in yourself.  New people you have met since that time think you're great, which proves it.  You have guts to tell reddit your story.

MentalHealthSupport,f1ucrm9,t3_datncn,1569757355.0,"I'm not a professional but i think this might be trauma from the time you attempted. Are you seeing a therapist weekly? These feelings shouldn't be arising in the way you say they are. If someone isn't interested in you that doesn't mean they don't like you. It just means you're not their flavor. If a girl likes you, that means she enjoys your company and personality.  You shouldn't feel like they need to be punished or hurt.  So i would say speaking with a therapist to work on the pattern of negative thoughts would be the best for you. You may need some guidance on how to change this thought pattern."

He set up the cards so that you'll know he has a crush on you.

Compliment her clothes or hair. If she smiles, and said thanks then grab her hand and walk with her a little while. 

I'm never sure if it's awkward to ask to kiss but you can usually get the feeling by the way she's looking at you that you can move for a kiss. If you give her a hug, pull back a bit with your hands on her hips and look at her and slowly move in. If she pulls back, then it's okay. She's not ready. but if she closes her eyes, she's waiting for you to kiss her. 

You've been on 5 dates, she obviously likes you. So stop over thinking things and express some confidence. If she doesn't want to kiss then respect her and continue the date. Don't show disappointment or that you're upset. She might want to take things slow."

Best friends will still be best friends but they have a path they will follow and you might drift apart. 

So meet new people, expand your group of friends and share your expertise in the activities you've been focusing your time on. Friends have female friends or family members.

Do something for yourself like grab a favorite coffee or smoothie on your way to work and keep thinking about how you can sleep when you're off later today. Hope you start feeling better!

datingoverthirty,f1m8sum,t1_f1m8abo,1569587827.0,Whoa!!! Thanks for the link and no i never heard about that! I'm going to check it out now. I love rollercoasters so i hope this doesn't ruin it for me lol.
datingoverthirty,f1m7sdk,t1_f1m73p9,1569586989.0,"It sounds familiar but i can't say i recall what it is. Like, a giant fun house kind of place but in a warehouse?"
dating_advice,f1m7kld,t1_f1m6pct,1569586804.0,"The more energy you or into it, the crazier it'll drive you. Closure is something that should be required but it's something you may never get. He might feel horrible, he might feel that was the only way to end things, or he might be a horrible person. Please don't waste your time on a certain closure that you have created. I'm certain you'll feel even worse than you do now. That's why i think you should acknowledge the way you feel and realize you hate this feeling. I'm sure you don't want to acknowledge it but you need to because it's driving you crazy. It sucks, he sucks, but you don't. The best way to get him back is to work on becoming happy without him. 1 year is long, but Not that long if you live to be 80 or even 40."
dating_advice,f1m6mb2,t3_d9zcn2,1569585945.0,"If you were attractive enough to find a partner, you're attractive enough to find someone better than him. Don't waste your time and energy on something that may never happen. Even if he comes back and you get back together, you'll be riddled with the dresser of him ghosting again. You hate this feeling, right? Then stop putting energy into it and put energy into the person you were before him. You're still that person."
dating_advice,f1m61aw,t1_f1m5nqf,1569585397.0,I agree with Kris_
dating_advice,f1m5t6w,t3_d9z77q,1569585184.0,"Nope, she seems to enjoy hanging out with you. So just keep hanging out and ""studying"". Just be cool, like the Fonz."
dating_advice,f1m5odm,t3_d9z7nm,1569585054.0,Yes.
datingoverthirty,f1m44r4,t1_f1m3p97,1569583539.0,"No, i know. I can't think right now of the perfect example but like slip n slides, not having laws requiring to wear a helmet. I guess, i change my answer to not as many law suits."
dating,f1m3xka,t3_d9yunb,1569583332.0,"You didn't do anything wrong from what i can tell. She's dealing with issues and probably tried using you to take her attention away from the breakup/infidelity or whatever is going on. She's not telling you everything and it seems like you're struggling to understand. Since she's withholding info and only giving you bits and pieces to put together, you're blaming yourself for her hangups. I'd say give her space. I kind of feel like she's in a relationship and is the one cheating but don't beat yourself up over her projecting the issues instead of dealing with them."
datingoverthirty,f1m2wu3,t3_d9yo0e,1569582245.0,"The amount of products made that were fun but not very safe. Trampolines, air rifle/guns and other stuff i can't think of. Lawsuits have ruined the amount of fun products that might have been produced."
