The fact that you recently wrote about his affect on your life proves that you are still too emotionally involved and obsessed/thinking about him to get anywhere near him. 

You may want to use this to prove to yourself that you aren't under his spell anymore. But needing to show yourself how much you don't care means that you really care way too much. Even now. 

Any anger that comes up as a part of you thinking about him, proves that I am right. If you are still angry deep down secretly inside.. If you still want to criticize him even though you haven't seen him in a while... it means you are still too attached.

 You need to take more time for yourself. And if at the end of this period of time directedly solely at your own needs, if you want to visit those friends just to see them. And not to prove to anyone, including yourself. That you are over him. Then go. But until the moment where you don't give a shit if you see him or not.

Customer: Are you sure? 

Me: What do you mean?

Me: That's correct.

It sucks when they act all upset about something they don't really need. Like cheetos or cupcakes. ""Damn, I have a dinner to be at in thirty minutes!"" Stomp their feet, then look at me.
