VaushV,fmlenxh,t3_fvwhk3,1586184888.0,"You realize the majority of the most influential games over the past 25 years have some sort of political/ideological component that makes them culturally significant, right?  Game makers don't owe making 'morally/ideologically neutral' games to anyone. Do you apply this same logic to film? literature? music? Can you imagine what metal gear solid would be like if the series never leveled a critique at American imperialism? I ask this without an ounce of sarcasm: do you actually enjoy art or have any respect for the artist's vision?  

Also, Persona 5 takes like 100 fucking hours to beat, removing this one scene doesn't change the nature of the game at all"

VaushV,fmfqu0a,t3_fuob3p,1586032942.0,"I've had the same thought for a while as well. I don't personally get the appeal of pigpuncher, but then again I'm older than the average viewer of him or Vaush which possibly lends to me engaging with their content differently. I watched the debate he did around the dirtbag left on ChudLogic's stream, while 60% of the debate was interesting he kept bringing up drama he has with some crazy SJW on twitter that for me derailed the conversation into territory I don't think lent itself well to the wider conversation. After the debate I browsed his twitter and he comes off as very immature in his battle with the 'wokelets'. For me, someone that will never be able to fully empathize with what's like to be attacked online, I just couldn't will myself to give two fucks. It will sound ageist of me, but I often forget how young he is and that maybe his age plays into what he finds important online. Either way, I think he should just focus on his streams and content production and log off of twitter for a while. That debate also helped me realize that pigpuncher and others view the dirtbag left as a movement, which it isn't, its a political attitude. He seems to want to justify his 'edginess' which I find odd. Just make the content you want, if people have a problem with your approach well then fuck'em. This diatribe was more long-winded than it should have been, my apologies. I will say I have a modicum of respect for anyone that can curate a following of people and bring joy into their lives. The few times I've popped into one of his streams he seems to have a dedicated base of fans, and in creating a space for them to feel accepted and have fun together is a good thing. I'm sure the longer he makes content and keeps doing what he's doing that he will develop a distinct voice or set of character traits that differentiate him from Vaush or Destiny. Well, hopefully, that happens."
