spirituality,fp48n3k,t3_gb7f0n,1588293894.0,"The fact that you’re here asking this is all a part of the journey! Find what you are drawn to. It is good you are starting with meditation and deep breathing exercises, that’s a simple and great place to start. Think about what your intentions are with it, and the path will illuminate.  

There are some brilliant guided meditations on YouTube. You may want to start there, then you can simply turn on calming music, I prefer Tibetan singing bowls. 

Surrendering yourself to the powers around you is also critical. We try so hard to be the drivers of our own lives, but the spiritual path is believing in divinity and that there is something guiding you. If you can tap into that and let go, you will move closer towards your spiritual self. 

My spiritual journey has been very personal, but of course many go on this path with others. The most important part of spirituality is to always know what works for you and stay true to that! Good luck on your journey ✨❤️"

My abandonment issues were  sort ingrained into me as a baby. 

Think back to the source of this, when you started feeling this way. Perhaps consider consulting with a professional who can sort it out with you. I never would have figured it out without my therapist. She saved my life but that’s not to say you will have the same experience.

Not to be the biggest downer ever, but these injuries led me to drug and alcohol addiction and I pondered suicide for several years.  This injury literally broke me completely. It broke my spirit and my heart. It took my sanity and my health in every way. 

I have been seeing a therapist for a year and a half and have been sober now for 3 months. I am doing so much better in every way possible and all that’s still broken is my physical but it upsets me that I don’t feel like I can ever be whole. 

Anytime the weather changes it is a reminder of my broken body and how much physical health effects  mental, emotional, intellectual, social, financial, environmental, spiritual, occupational, energetic health. All of these components that make up who we are depend on physical health. 

What keeps me grounded is remembering I could have it worse. There are people out there with far worse injuries than mine so i am grateful for my life and all of the blessings I have had. Every once in a while i just want to scream and fix this thing that has taken so much from me (I wasn’t able to study abroad in college because of it and it’s something that I regret) ... but once this quarantine clears I am going to travel and do some of the things I thought I couldnt and push through at my own pace."
