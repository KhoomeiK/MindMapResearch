Anxiety,f741cqv,t3_dubotu,1573397023.0,"Anxiety comes from the subconscious mind, which perceives threats independent of the rational mind. Cognitive Behavioral Theory offers some techniques to reconcile the two, but is not a magical cure."
Anxiety,f6p9jvx,t3_dsgz2z,1573051107.0,"Unfortunately what you are experiencing is common. I have found medications very helpful. Try paroxetine or duloxetine. Xanax works better but can be habit forming. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy helps a little, but it’s slow and requires constant effort."
depression,f6mobpb,t3_ds0mvj,1572976026.0,"I tried quitting Paxil cold turkey a while ago. I got through the withdrawal ok too, but after a while depression and panic attacks returned, caught me off guard. My doc prescribed duloxetine, which is working pretty well."
depression,f6mn541,t3_ds1wgj,1572975549.0,"I couldn’t live without them. Took Paxil for many years and it lowered my anxiety and prevented panic attacks. Now on duloxetine which also helps. They’re not perfect for me, but I’m definitely worse off without them. Something I have to adjust dose up or down to moderate side effects, but that’s manageable."
keto,f6mm0qh,t3_ds2eji,1572975085.0,I have been doing keto and weights for a while. I have had no problems. Feel great.
Anxiety,f6ihat3,t3_dri6di,1572878514.0,Hasn’t worked for me. Anxiety just gets worse. I have to supplement snri with buspar and Xanax as needed.
depression,f6dyrvn,t3_dqzwqg,1572798266.0,Depression affects memory. Unfortunately antidepressants do too. You can’t win.
IBSHelp,f6dwhwf,t3_dn2jyk,1572797623.0,I tried cbd oil. It helped me with anxiety but caused memory problems— I lost my stream of thought in the middle of sentences. I had to stop using it.
keto,f6dtsf6,t1_f6cme93,1572796993.0,"I mostly eliminated breakfast cereal, bread, root vegetables, rice, pasta. Results have been excellent even though I treat myself ice cream almost daily."
ChronicPain,f6dop2r,t3_c6t6ec,1572795878.0,Didn’t help me. I tried patch and gel.
