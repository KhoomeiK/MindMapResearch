WeightLossAdvice,fr0hh06,t1_fr0dgau,1589795814.0,"I agree with you. Lately ive been treating my need for sweets and by I foods like my friends mom treata cigarettes. She claims shes a smoker and loves smoking. But she says shes abstaining until she gets to heaven. Her advice on quitting was that whenever she has a craving she will do something to distract herself. And then it will go away for a time. 

I applied this to my eating habits in a similar way if I'm craving a snack then I can definitely have one. But first I find something to do. Usually the craving goes away. If it doesnt, then i know I'm actually hungry. So then I find something healthier to eat than what I'm craving with the mindset that I'm gonna eat that snack after if I am still hungry. More often than not I'm not hungry anymore. If I am I'll just repeat the steps. 

Its helped me cut down on the insane cravings and need for junk food that i normally have. And its saved me a ton of calories and carbs I dont need. Not buying junk foods and other heavy snacks isnt an option for me because I have a 7 and 14 year old. And we have to keep snacks and candies and stuff stocked for them as well as because my youngest is a type 1 diabetic and his blood sugar fluctuates often."

When opened is a tube thats plugged and another type of thing you can unscrew/unplug. Idk what they are called. But basically you unplug the tube and drain it till it stops. Then once thats done you unscrew the other part and pull that out. Clean that thing and put it back. It solved my issue immediately. My thing was clogged with a lot of dog hair and some random small peice of cardboard that was probably in my kids clothes. There was also a few legos.
