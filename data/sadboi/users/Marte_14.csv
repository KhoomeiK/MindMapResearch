I am not quite sure if we will get to see the king (the fusion between the twin) but maybe we will get to see Roman and Remus have a much more good relationship because Roman will find a support in Remus because they are both extra in their way. 


After that maybe Roman will let a bit of space to Remus and ""duck out"" (Quack) giving Roman only gore ideas."

SandersSides,fpogmxk,t3_gelnwq,1588784164.0,"It’s a amazing theory and really possible! After all everyone thought that the new side is about anger but it’s more a emotion... And the Thomas’s anger of the start could only be his shame and guilt not the manifestation of the orange side ‘anger’ but the consequence of the presence of ‘Shame’.

If Roman have a brother after they separate, maybe Shame is a sort of little brother of Virgil, they were separate but born in the same time probably when Thomas was a teenager the anxiety of the society of be different and the shame of be gay, after all Anxiety and Shame of themself are together most of the time.

But Virgil was worried of the effects this Orange side were having on Thomas, maybe he was been too strong so Virgil shout him down and from, probably, Paranoia he became Anxiety and became a good or neutral side.

But Shame is Shame after all whit all the marriage thing and all the problems we saw int he episode the shame was there.

This theory is amazing.

He never abused me or anything, this was a thing that my grandma did to him when we had the same age.
But anyway this isn’t a way to educate your children, because even after I continue to hit my brother when he provocate me. I think you should take one kid and punish him because he hit the other one, while the other kid you should control them and see if they provoke the first one.

But I think that the reference about the roman is in the names of Remus (he is one of the brothers who create Rome) and Roman (I don’t think it need to explain).

The fact they are Duke and Prince is a reference to the function of a royal family, the Prince is the one who became king and the duke is the brother of the prince (if I am not wrong) so together will became a King.
Even because I thing that Prince and Duke are a reference to the Disney, so it’s more near to king.

The pairs in reality could be multiple we can see even :

Roman and Virgil (courage/dreams and fear/insecure) 

Janus and Patton (coldness/lies and friendly/truthful) 

Logan and Remus (logic and craziness) 

Logan and Patton (logical and sentimental) 

Logan and Janus (Fact and Fiction) 

Roman and Remus (family friendly and gore) 

I think we should get the pair that show up more:

Virgil neutral

Roman and Remus

Logan and the orange side

Patton and Janus


I think that Patton and Janus are more a pair of Logan and Janus because they were a lot against each other in the series. 
And I think that Janus use truthful to manipulate people, and lies only about personal fact. 
So they Logan and Janus are in part fact and fiction, even because we could say that Logan and Virgil are fact and fiction, because Virgil distort the reality because of his anxiety. 


Nice theory anyway! :)"
SandersSides,fpgqi1h,t3_gcqj8l,1588607668.0,"Well we can say Remus, Janus and the Orange side are the dark side while Logan, Patton and Roman are the main side, and the one that are good.

We aren't sure about Logan. Roman and Virgil will be against it probably, so I think the real process of Janus will start when the others show up. 
We don't know if he have a secret plan, but he seems like he only wants that Thomas fell good, so maybe he will try to go in a more selfish way, or maybe try to a more balanced between be selfish and selfless."

I think Virgil will is already becoming paranoia but his final transformation will happen in a episode with both Remus and Janus. After all he hate them and the only motive why he didn't come out in the last episode is because he was scared of the orange side. 
Virgil would every time protect Thomas from Janus, he is the only one who could immediately recognize him, so he should really busy whit something to not show up.

Mine was probably cause by my shitty school in that period I even forget that I like drawing and how to use a pencil, in fact when I went on summer holidays away from that place I restart to draw and boom everything I forgot came back. 

So maybe it's not only depression maybe you are in a toxic place (like school, club, team of some sort or thinks like that), if you feel in a bad place try go away from there. 
Or maybe you need to make a change like the colors of your room, the place or the time when you draw and play, or maybe you can try to change your style like cut your hair or the colors of your clothes. 
You can even fill the walls of your room whit photos of people drawings that you like and study them, try to change your style of draws and try out new things like using new techniques, and for the music I am not good at it but you can try to play the songs that you like and let them inspire you.
