I hope you find comfort in these words. 
I cannot honestly imagine what you are going through.  It's terrifying when all these things just show up randomly at once, and extremely overwhelming. I really do understand and i'm sending you full love and support and i'll sincerely be praying with you. So please take time to yourself and reach out to loved one, reach out to calming and Comforting company, whether it is someone, and be sure that many many people care about you because i am sure you're a great person and i know for sure that you have to have impacted someone's life positively at some point (whoever showed up in your mighg right now must be a great example i guess) , or a pet, and i'm sure animals can sense pain and will try to help. Lastly, i am asking that you do not act on anything that your brain tells you before thinking ' is this a good idea ' if the answer is yes, do proceed, if it's no reach out for someone as soon as possible and please please please do not think about giving up and keep looking for joy in the little things. 'Little things matter, little things make life a happier place '. 
Stay safe, please be okay.
Much love, support and prayers. 
And to anyone who might be struggling, you are not alone, i feel your pain, we're all fighting for a better life and we will do our best to not give up and win our fight,  and do not be scared or worried or ashamed of seeking help, you already are great for surviving this long. 
YOU GO OP I BELIEVE IN YOU !!!
Thank you for taking the time to read this."

I think in a mix of all these languages, probably because that's how I speak too, although English is the dominant language because I use it all the time in my studies. I don't dream very often, but I think I mainly dream in arabic... Not sure though"
