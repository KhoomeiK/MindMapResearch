learnprogramming,fkucmuc,t3_fkrfu2,1584546870.0,"Databases are sure handy for that. SQL will allow you to create relational databases. It will allow you to filter according to some criteria like type and more. You will be able to query existing and nonexistent entries. Go for it. Before you do, you may want to think about the structure of the database -  it doesn't have to be one big chunk; it could be multiple but related databases that are linked via a foreign key. The structuring depends on what you want to do in general. In short, database using sql is a good idea and thinking ahead on how to structure it depending on the need would be even better."

learnmachinelearning,fjvqbd2,t3_fe9ivh,1583629848.0,"From what I can tell, if you're getting the ings from just a vid with relative fixed viewpoint you may be able to get arround using just a crosscorrelation operation (no learning rewuired)

You may generally start with 300 images for these applications. I don't know the nature of the project, but this would be I think a good starting point given the descriptions you've given."
learnmachinelearning,fjvpp7f,t3_fea9o8,1583629629.0,"There have been papers on this. Without a learge enough database you may not be able to do this. 

This would be possible without ML tho. There has been tons of work on fabric fitting to 3D models albeit pretty old but they do work it is just tedious to make a 3d model of a clothing then simulate fitting. 

I guess I would say start with the existing project that do this. May be take a look if they offer theie dataset for free."
learnmachinelearning,fjvoih2,t3_febo84,1583629320.0,Use a 3D Convolutions. 2D convolutions correlate 2 dimensions : up and down. 3D Convolutions on 2D images with a sequence can correlate up and down and time. I think this would work better than RNN because it has a heads up that features tend to stay locally near each other in small increments of time.
learnmachinelearning,fjvnqwp,t3_femohd,1583629059.0,"Linear regression works well for goods and services of good and top companies. It gets funky for other companies. You can chat me if you want more help. It depends on the approach you're taking. If you want linear regressions, you can cluster goods and services according to some criteria then do a linear fit for each cluster. Other models can rely on statistics basing off on previous prices forecast the next."
learnmachinelearning,fjvmrob,t3_fepoxl,1583628796.0,ML is used for similar situations. So you're on the right track. It may be hard tho - this makes it fun.
learnmachinelearning,fjvmgz5,t3_feq0da,1583628715.0,".    Simplifying - an image can thought of a result of some sampling process from a distribution : for example, one may pick the first pixel randomly then the second pixel is sampled given the first ; then the third is sampled given the previous. Having an assumption of the probability model is the starting point of creating density models. After this you take an approach, whether to do explicit or implicit. Explicit is more direct like replacing a part of the probability equation with a neural network. Implicit: you use some kind of stochastic process to create or approx your distribution like a game theoretic approach of GANs."
learnmachinelearning,fjvknt6,t3_feytrg,1583628192.0,"You are right that noise reducing schemes in the form of smoothing will result in bad predictions because the ruggedness of the signals are very important to determine the type of activity. Movement information is hard to info because all the spikes and bump mean something since it indicates if an action is smooth or not too. For example clapping may be an up down pattern and running would up down to but with more curvature. 

Vanilla LSTM models give good predictions right away with little tweaking. I think you can start from here."
