She got some information that she hadn’t had before, and she changed her plans based on that information. That’s not a bad thing to do. She understands that the money you spent is gone, regardless of whether or not she goes to Princeton. She understands the sunk cost fallacy- there are LOTS of adults who don’t.

That said, she should know that she should not make major decisions based on one source of information. There are unreliable sources of information out there. She should research whether other sources concur on this. She should think about possible bias on the site, or in the people who post to it. They’re probably not a representative sample of students at Ivy League schools.

Competitiveness can also vary considerably between majors. Pre-med biology majors probably don’t have the same experience as people in majors where most of them won’t be trying to get into a competitive postgraduate program (say, education or math majors).

Much of what I do with the kids Jewishly is intended to avoid negative feelings about it, and to promote positive feelings."
