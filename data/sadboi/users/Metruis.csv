SuicideWatch,foeqk9i,t3_g6qx7q,1587711409.0,"Every one that you've reported to Cybertip has helped. Every single report is run through a robot to see if they've viewed that image before; if so, they begin sending takedown notices to the web provider. If it's new, multiple analysts categorize it. The analysts do not require any notice to take mental health days if it's too much. They are mostly all fierce child-protectors with children of their own and a drive to stop all child abuse. Due to reports to Cybertip real children have been identified and rescued. Survivors have been helped and brought together. And through this all, a program has been developed to minimize any human's requirement to look and and reopen the trauma of a child's past.

By making reports to Cybertip, you have directly contributed to the development of Project Arachnid, which has taken down literally TENS OF THOUSANDS of images from known cases... because if you saw it in one place, that picture is somewhere else too.

Don't feel guilt for tapping out. Even the professionals who actually work at Cybertip in the Canadian Centre for Child Protection are given the right to tap out any day, with no questions asked. You more than certainly have the right to get upset with what you've seen and report it, as it does actively help with a very real project ongoing today and hopefully for years until it's no longer a problem. You also have the right to say it's too much for you to handle and leave it to those professionals, who are trained to bear the mental load.

I will be honest with you. I know about this because my housemate works there as one of the web developers for Cybertip and she gushes about their enormous recent successes to me   
(they even had a New York Times article about this project recently!)

Somehow she has worked there for ages and has no intention to stop because the underlying motivation to protect kids drives her. I couldn't do it. Even the THOUGHT that child sexual abuse images are out there makes me start crying a little bit. I couldn't even work there, let alone be an analyst. I could not do ONE day there. Even visiting the Centre was hard for me, because on the walls there were their motivational successes and seeing the number of takedowns just broke me. Of course that same number motivates them to continue, but apparently my reaction of just zeroing in on how high it was, was pretty normal. They've taken down an unbelievable number of abusive images concerning children, and it is thanks to people like you going ""oh my god this is disgusting... but before I go bleach my mind, I'm going to email this link to the tipline."" I also saw a picture with the actual abuse blacked out, so that you could identify the objects in the image and theoretically lead investigators closer to finding out who and where this is... and even fully censored, no abuse visible, I couldn't handle looking at that picture and I still remember it and it breaks me.

Like you, I am a bisexual woman who has only been with people in my age bracket, or uh, old enough that it was getting weird in another direction. We might have freaky sides that lead us to look at porn involving adults and weird stuff. If your reaction to child sexual abuse images or videos is ""I don't want to look at this ever again, have I been forever changed into a monster just because I know this exists?"" I'd say you're pretty much a normal human being experiencing revulsion at a certain human's monstrous actions, even if you DID get there by searching for hentai tentacle rape (involving non-consenting adults). Look, you might have a freaky side, that's okay, as long as you reserve it for consenting people in your age bracket or up.

I had an 18 year old hit me up on a dating site and I was like eeeeeeee no that's too young. I'm 30. If you would have a similar reaction to someone barely legal sending you a hookup request, and would prefer to have an encounter with someone a similar age to yourself, I can safely say that you are not a potential child predator, even if you did fall down a horrible rabbit hole and see some terrible things. You did the right thing, you reported it.

(Note on phrasing: they don't like to call it ""child porn"" because that does imply a sort of consent and pleasurable material association. It is thus, ""child sexual abuse imagery"". Maximizing your discomfort for the truth. It's not porn there, it's evidence of a crime of abuse.  They also do a lot of other great stuff at Cybertip to teach kids how to avoid being taken advantage of by predators, and I'm always happy to speak their praise. People should definitely donate to them, they're doing so much to get abuse off the web to keep the scars from being constantly reopened for the victims.)

I hope getting a little view into how your reports were used to help might cheer you up a bit. Nothing is ever ignored. Actually, during the pandemic reports have increased so much they were able to get permission to keep working, even though they're not traditionally ""essential"", so they haven't even stopped doing whatever they can to get abuse off the web. This isn't like sending a bug report. Everything they get will be investigated, without a real human having to look at any picture they've been sent before (their bot turns it into a hash that can never be turned into an image again, and then looks at anything that's reported first to ensure that the images are not re-viewed once categorized). While that does not mean all of these children will be saved (a sad truth is that many of the children are adults now, as their images continue to be shared for many years), it does result in some kids being saved if it turns out to be current! Sometimes there are enough clues in the background that with other reports, they might be able to identify an offender and send in police officers to make an arrest! I know I heard that there were many arrests last year, so it's working. These people care a TON about kids and their welfare!

At the very least, it means the website will be given takedown notices, and if that fails, their provider will be badgered about hosting these images, which does often eventually work. So if all of what you ran into was on one website, that would have probably been enough of a report to ensure that they know who to start sending threats.

You shouldn't go out of your way to seek out these materials, as it cannot be distinguished in an investigation whether someone was searching intentionally or heroically. If you find them accidentally while being a pervert for something legal, do send a report to Cybertip and help them the kids. It really does help when you do that. What they do wouldn't work if people like you didn't go ""gross gross gross noooooo but I need to make sure the authorities know"".

Your pain makes sense, though. I feel it too. Even imagining that these images exist makes me start welling up. I hate it so much, that not only are kids being abused, but then their abuse is being opened up for someone's sick pleasure over and over again, keeping it alive in their minds. I hate that those kids are usually depressed and have trouble with suicidal thoughts and are hurt forever. I want to protect them, but I know that I don't have the mental fortitude to look at child sexual abuse images even once without having a violent physical reaction. I don't think my house mate could either, but she at least can avoid being triggered by the thought of it enough to do some programming. Somehow the analysts handle it, and they are fierce indeed. It is okay for you to not have that fortitude. There are other ways for you to protect kids. For example, if you see someone young asking questions about their new kinky relationship dreams, you might teach them about relationship red flags and give them advice that keeps them from ever getting hurt in the first place. You might meet a kid who has someone pressuring them for pictures, and give them advice on how to handle this and protect their nude snapchat from being shared all across the school, again preventing the abuse from happening in the first place. This way you can empower kids to protect themselves from common pitfalls in their developing relationships without triggering yourself to feel suicidal, a thought that really makes sense to me, knowing how violent of an internal reaction I have to the thought of those images. It's horrible, but it's not your fault, not even a little, that someone you don't know was a monster to someone else that you don't know. Take the opportunities you have today, and in the future, to prevent abuse from happening, avoiding the need to rescue someone by educating them on safe sexual practices. A huge one today is making sure that teens know better than to send their significant other a nude, because a teen breakup and resultant image sharing scandal has resulted in teenage suicides. This can be avoided if you talk image sharing before it happens, and being on Reddit, you have opportunities to share this advice with the ones who need it. In this way, you can help prevent an image that hurts someone from being shared, without giving yourself a mental breakdown."

You will get downvoted for this though, because Reddit shills really want to divide us and conquer us. I estimate approximately half of the downvotes that come from suggesting we judge individual people based on their actions are from such shills which may not even be human beings, but just robots. I always get downvoted into oblivion for suggesting we work together and try to overcome challenges as a team of humans... but in REAL life, everyone I meet is very agreeable to this idea that we shouldn't judge each other based on one single aspect of our lives and beliefs.

I used to be a conservative Christian. It was stupid to hate other religious groups.

I'm LGBT (hence why I'm no longer a conservative Christian). It's stupid to hate people for being a different sexual orientation.

I vote exclusively based on which person I think will help my area of the city the most and not the final outcome of the prime minister (Canadian, so obviously I'm not a MAGA type) and it is stupid to hate people for voting differently. I know people who vote because they want a specific prime minister, I know people who vote because they support a party, I know people who vote because they are part of a party, I know people who vote to protest... none of these are good reasons to hate people.

Fight against the division of people versus people for stupid reasons. Never stop resisting. We are a social species and if we shun people for everything, eventually we will **find ourselves alone**. It will be for a stupid reason that we will be alone. That last person will shun you because you eat canned tuna, the previous one shunned you because you like brussels sprouts, the one before that shunned you because you had a sexual encounter with a person of another race, the one before that blocked you out because you yelled at them once... and so on and so forth, until we have no allies left and we can be effortlessly picked off and manipulated and all of our lives are with AI in VR because no one knows how to connect to another human because inevitably, we are all a little bit different.

Unfortunately, though, we will be downvoted for holding this common sense because the wagon riders LIKE having an excuse to fan up their hate frenzy into a bonfire and burn the witches. Is that where this will end? When mobs are dragging out people of one political leaning or another? That's horseshit and any real human with a modicum of sense knows it.

If they are SELLING YOUR ART what they are doing is LEGALLY THEFT and you could SUE THEM. They are only relying on you not doing it.

Please report the bullying to adults.

The only non-asshole resolution is that they pay you a % or single use fee that you agree to for use of the art. This could be as simple as $20, or as complex as 70% of all profit from sales from your art, which is clearly not that shitty if they put it on a fucking shirt to sell. If they do not pay up, they have stolen your art. Simple as that. They did it mindfully too, because they cropped your signature out. They knew. They just didn't think you'd find out or react. They might not have realized it was art from their classmate. You could report the art theft to GoFundMe too and likely have it taken down for copyright violation, which this is.

magicbuilding,fnynv49,t3_g4fqgf,1587369172.0,"I was almost going to pass this by until I remembered the classic: Holy Trinity. Jesus functions as matter, a physical incarnation tool for the Father who is more of an energy concept and the Holy Spirit is basically an energy field that permeates all things in the sense you're looking at energy or field as a concept. As it goes, they all can function separately, but they also flow into each other as a single functional godhead. You could look at making it akin to a trinity, where any of the elements could be studied separately but they would be useless without each other due to some intrinsic connection between those three things. In the holy pantheon of course, the connection is a family bond as the symbolism.

Essentially you create a relationship or symbiosis between each of your three magical or divine or mundane-but-usable-mystically items. A category that holds them together. One amplifies the other. Or you could view it as creating a rock-paper-scissors loop. One way it amplifies, one way it negates. 

Another classic trinity to draw on is the Maiden, the Mother, and the Hag... the cycle of growth and death, the three witches.

I think if you give your three forms a thematic bond that people can resonate with, they will accept the rules of interaction that you give to your system.

You could also handwave it by saying different users access the magic energy field in different fashions due to their school of teaching, and thus they perceive it in a moderately different way. I see an example of this with alchemistry and alcehestry in Full Metal Alchemist. Similar arts, but from different traditions, and thus the language and tools used to interact with it differ.

Your friend's death is a tragedy, no mistake. :( Yes, someone who drives drunk is selfish, uncaring, and undisciplined. I had a couple drinks today. My head is relatively clear, but I would never trust my feelings on that matter and drive when I'm even just a couple of drinks in. You can't accidentally get drunk, there's always a better way to get home than in your own car, and everyone has time to plan for that before getting drunk outside of their own home unless they're too selfish and absorbed to care. Reckless behavior killed your friend, and that's a fucking shame. Drunk driving deaths are 100% avoidable. And it's usually not the drunk who dies. It's shameful.

That person lives with the guilt, hopefully, whenever they close their eyes or are alone.

CollapseSupport,fnvbsie,t3_g441hp,1587287361.0,"Eh, you don't know that your work is actually turds unless you release them to see if they float or sink. Most people who succeed at writing a thing do it older than you, in their 30s or 40s, based on years of experience, and many of the great writers of today were in boats as bad or worse than yours... it's a common story for a writer to come from nowhere. Right now you're learning to tell stories.

Consider this: writing is more than novels. What if you were writing dialogue for a video game? What if you were writing RPG modules? What if you were writing blog posts? What if you were writing social media posts? What if you were doing a printed zine you mailed out monthly? What if you were writing a comic? What if you were writing technical manuals? What if you were writing how to articles? What if you were writing personal question / answer articles? There are many ways to take writing and start pushing it to make money.

Melatonin doesn't always help. It sounds like your brain is keeping you awake.

Your post isn't selfish. It's you trying to figure yourself out, and it might resonate with other people, especially other creatives. I was there at 25. I still veer right back into the exact same sort of ""I was sheltered, I have no education, I will never amount to anyone"" anxieties on a bad day, but it's a lot more stable now (I'm 30). I have definitely improved on some of the things I hated myself for at 20 and 25, etc. It just takes hard work and persistence. Childhood isn't this magical place where you can learn everything and then it goes away, you can always better yourself as long as you're alive, you can always chase that inner childlike idealism to get excited about learning. If you can't get excited, it's probably not what you want to be doing. Excitement is a great compass, so if you don't feel a thrill of the challenge of advanced maths, great, whatever, leave it!

Anyway, this sub is a fine place for you to express your anxieties about social breakdown in this time of change, which is definitely what some of this is based on, though not all. I can't say that you will ""get better"" but you can improve on the state you're in without having to go to school. Working out isn't a bad suggestion, by the way, you seem opposed to it, it isn't a magic fix it but it can help you fall asleep better if you exhaust yourself for one thing.

Finally, you can date low cost, just be clear about your expectations before going out, and plan to do cheap things like walk in the park and stargaze. You don't have to give up if you don't want to. Your attitude is very important in surviving this. If you view it as a challenge to be overcome it's easier than if you view it as a wall that can never be passed. You started in a harder mode than some people, but that doesn't mean finding love, a job, a place where you can feel safe from your parents, is impossible. It just might be harder. Keep enduring and don't give up on yourself, be gentle to yourself, you are the one person standing between yourself and mental peace when you're in bed. Don't worry about all of this all at once. Just pick ONE thing and work on it. Then when you look back in five years you'll say, ""I haven't done it all yet but I've come a long ways, whew."""

How you choose to look at it is critical to escaping it.

Sure, maybe you won't be a scientist or an artist or a political theorist. Did you WANT to be one of those things? No excitement drives to towards those fields, if you have ruled them out. That doesn't mean you won't be something else. Like, you like Instagram and social media and stuff, you could be a social media manager. If I were making a few times more money as a self-employed person, I would hire someone to do social media for me because personally? I hate it. I never spend time farting around on my phone if I can be doing something else. So, having the skill of ""good at social media"" makes you valuable to someone.

It does sound like you could use professional help since you've been self-diagnosing, which is not the same as an actual diagnose.

You should also know that speaking skills and intelligence can all be trained. You simply have to stop thinking of them as roadblocks, and instead of challenges. ""I want to learn more about interpersonal communication"" instead of deciding, ""I will never be good at communication."" Invite it as a challenge and face it with determination. Everyone has to learn some skills they're initially crap at, and that's one of yours. You might be kind of thick, but that doesn't mean you can't learn to empathize. Almost everyone can do that, it's wired into humans by default in most settings. It's your experiences that shake it out of you, and it's hard to undo the programming of life's hard knocks without a professional to help you unwind it. I've never been to a pro, though, so I know you don't have to, to do it.

Also, ""I'm sorry, I'm sending you love"" is a perfectly fine statement. Consider this: could what you're missing be a different love language? There is more than just words with which to communicate. Maybe what you're missing is that you're naturally service act oriented, and you would feel more like you ""helped"" if you did something for the person you're trying to comfort, rather than saying something. Words might not be your thing, and that's okay. Some people give gifts or show affection in physical manners instead, and these help connect you to other people too. Sometimes it's what you can do that counts, like helping someone move or paint a wall or make some bread or whatever. :) Not just what you say. So if you're afraid you're not eloquent enough... which you are, your post resonates with many... you can try doing acts to communicate your feelings or offer help instead."
UnsentLetters,fnq9bpn,t3_g3b3f2,1587160178.0,"If they did ghost and it's not just their anxiety winning, it's because they knew you had only one vision for the future with them in it, it didn't match what they wanted (specifically I assume you wanted sex and romance and not just friendship) and they had no idea how to communicate that to you without you becoming depressed or violent. This was the easy safe way. Maybe neither of those things would have happened but almost every woman has had someone turn into a monster after being romantically rejected. The way you worded your message makes you sound like an emotional time bomb so honestly I'd have ghosted you too if you were not taking the hint I was not sexually or romantically interested. It's tedious to try have a guy as a friend when you just want a friend and he is constantly just trying to get you to marry him. Getting ghosted sucks; getting violently stalked is worse. I've had shitty responses to denials so I get it.

You should send them the last part. That last part is a powerful offer of friendship worth extending if you care about them.

Can you compromise and wear a natural organic makeup to work? For example mineral powder? If you throw on a layer of powder and a non-tinted plain clay powder it can do a lot to keep down sweat beading which would help you look more professional than just a tinted lip balm. I would do this if I were in any kind of sales profession... I hate putting on makeup, but I'd do a layer of tinted powder and a layer of un-tinted powder, one line of eyeliner, maybe mascara, and a tinted lip balm if I want to try look ""presentable"". My skin is pretty cranky but I've found if I strictly use like, a clay powder, my face behaves all right. I have to buy the powder online to get a decent price, but I've always found I can get a good organic cosmetic on Etsy for the purpose. Obviously you wouldn't want to do the sort of several hour long fine art makeup looks you might do for Instagram, that's crazy, it's not even the same ballpark as what you would be expected to wear to ""show well"" in a job that has that kind of expectation.

To be honest I'd quit a job that demanded I wear makeup, but if you don't hate wearing it, you could probably come up with a middle ground that makes you look like you put in a bunch of effort but only takes you five minutes of smacking on some powder, that won't make you totally break out.

Buddy, you can be attracted to whoever you like. Your mom doesn't have any say in that. You're welcome to not view porn. Having viewed some porn of a woman like the one you are now attracted to might be what you consider sinful because of your cult like brainwashing (I was a dedicated conservative Christian for many years so I know how that guilt weighs on the soul) so let me just solve that with your own language.

You are washed in the blood of Jesus, the all covering all forgiving blood of the Lord. Your sin is as far as the East is from the West. It will never be brought up again by God. You are forgiven. End of discussion.

The guilt comes from your mom (and she's right you shouldn't look at porn underage because it warps your perspective of future relationships) and your own anxiety. It doesn't fit in with your religious beliefs which would say you are forgiven, don't make a habit of viewing porn.

Loving and being attracted to your potential future wife is normal, sane, and nothing to froth yourself into guilt over. You have a type. Looking at your girlfriend and being aroused is not sin, it's normal. Looking at porn and being aroused is also normal although it could be considered cheating on your future wife, thus sin. Ask yourself this: how many people do you know who are divorced and remarried? Yeah. If porn is a sin we made up, that's a sin specifically mentioned in the Bible. But they are forgiven. They are okay. They made a mistake and God's grace covers that.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fnl4aoh,t3_g2etmg,1587046701.0,"Yeah, the first time I just got a sense of what I was wearing and my status in life. The most reliable thing I can get is my shoes and pants and underwear. It's silly but I've verified that my place and time period impression is correct by that information alone. You should do it if you're thinking about it, your past lives might be calling!

I mostly just remember mundane details about day to day life. Got a name for the most recent past life from a regression which I didn't understand fully, I was told ""you need more information to understand the name you heard"", sure enough later that past life voice pops in my head and points out a used book. ""That's mine."" ""What's in it? Money?"" I asked. ""No. The information."" And in the opening page there's the name I got (it was an unfamiliar surname until then), and a date from the year I was born and a city in the province I was born, two hours away from my birthplace. So someday I will maybe go to try get death records from that year and find the name and verify that the person I remember being did die in the months before I was born.

That's one trippy thing I got from a regression. I didn't pay to be hypnotized either, you can do it to yourself, it's just probably easier if you go to a QHHT practitioner to be regressed if that's available. I'd like to, someday, but for now I've just used YouTube hypnosis tracks and meditation to get there. I know it's real because it's always boring domestic memories in first person, short and fixated on a task at hand. My fantasies are way more interesting!"

Wanting a break from ministry doesn't mean she'll stop believing. I started remembering past lives and I still kept going to church. I'm still spiritual. God still makes sense to me. It's the cult like side I've broken off from. Deconversion is not fast. You might be able to hack it if you could just not talk religion and let each other believe what you will."
SuicideWatch,fnl2b76,t3_g2evkb,1587045534.0,"I would completely understand if someone with an ALS diagnose killed themselves while they still had control. If you're just afraid that the disease exists you're kinda jumping the gun. It's a slow burn with definitely clear indications it's on its way. You'll know you have it and when your window to kill yourself would be. It's not something to kill yourself over the idea that maybe you might get it. It is a horrible diagnose and maybe if you stay alive you can contribute to research, donate money, raise awareness, or help someone suffering from it in some way to face your fear and help make the world a little better.

I know I might not be brave enough to endure a few years of life with a degenerative disease, I get it, it's scary to consider. I'd rather just have a heart attack in my sleep and never wake back up."
Advice,fnl1txj,t3_g2ewtx,1587045247.0,"Your input helped them reach a point where they felt safe enough to trust a professional. They might not have been able to do that if they didn't first learn to trust you. Just like you won't do surgery on them, some work can be better performed by professionals. It's good that this is helping and it is good you care about your partner. Don't be down that you weren't the magical pill that healed them, you did help, just not 100% of the way. They still need you, just now they're not desperate. Now you have room to work on yourself and the complicated emotions it's brought up in you, since you clearly have a healer complex. It's not that you're a bad person, you're just experiencing flawed logic where you have jealousy for their ability to undo your partner's flawed logics. Yours too is anxiety based. Don't let it eat you up. You're still very important to them."
Advice,fnl1c9y,t3_g2ex8t,1587044953.0,"If you decide you have discipline issues then you will always have discipline issues. Resigning to it will make it so. Really what you have is a commitment to something other than whatever gets you ahead in life so figure out how to monetize what you're actually passionate about. Maybe you're trying to shove yourself into a round hole when you're really a pyramid. Don't get stuck just because you know round holes are generally good. Maybe you fit into it okay but there's still plenty of room for you to really figure out what makes you excited about life.

Not only is it possible, literally only you can break this cycle of self sabotage. Maybe you'll have to break your conception of what success looks like, and what a successful person looks like to get there though. Your preconceptions may be holding you back.

No, resignation is not your destiny, it's a choice on what you decide is important enough to spend your time on. Time is the most limited resource you have. Why are you spending it on Reddit... unless that somehow gets you ahead? Where can you make changes that would funnel you towards success, penning you in a direction leading towards more of an active outcome?

Follow what excites you and you will always get where you need to be. Excitement is your compass. If the thrill of crushing these tests isn't that important to you, what is? You know the answer isn't ""YouTube"", unless it is, in which case ""YouTuber"" might be your career path. In that case, YouTube is just you wasting time that could be getting you to what excites you."

shittyfoodporn,fnl0h5k,t1_fmkaver,1587044425.0,"Actually, what happened was, I went to play with my cat (not a euphemism) and during that time the oil was heating way too high and then I dropped them in... Without checking the temperature... This happened in seconds. No fire occurred. I set off the fire alarm and opened all the windows, but nothing was damaged other than this batch of shrimp! I didn't even get burned. Very lucky. It could have caused a fire. I did have baking soda in reach in case of that so nothing would have come of it. I was new to deep frying. The second time worked out!"
shittyfoodporn,fnl06vx,t1_fmk7zaj,1587044242.0,I did! It worked the next time!
shittyfoodporn,fnl05xi,t1_fmm652c,1587044225.0,Yep. Really should have stuck with oil.
shittyfoodporn,fnl04z5,t1_fmloll0,1587044208.0,I tried again and did it right this time! Whew!
