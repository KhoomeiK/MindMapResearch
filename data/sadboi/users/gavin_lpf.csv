With groups it would be multiplied. I get how much you hate this. 1 year of medication (the right ones) and talk therapy have been instrumental in laying down a positive path. Other than that be curious about your condition (if diagnosed) and pursue the path of a happy warrior. Tell those around you so that they can support you. Ultimately this is a battle for your self esteem. You will win it. I send love and positivity your way. Crush it!!"
