BipolarReddit,fnj3hp1,t1_fnj0wfe,1586991263.0,It's okay to call again to see what's happening. But it's also normal for doctors to make their calls at the end of the day. All the best to you.

askphilosophy,fke88op,t3_fhz60k,1584107583.0,"If he believes in seeing a doctor for any reason at all, he should believe their advice on this. Also, God knowing your fate just means he knows in advance the decisions you'll make, not that you can't make decisions. Also, no decision is a decision. Also, God put doctors and scientists on earth to protect and help everyone. He is working through them.

These aren't the tightest philosophical arguments, but they would have worked on me when I was a Christian."

AskReddit,fk97o4w,t1_fk89wmc,1583970413.0,I guess what was once fancy becomes cheap tech if enough people use it. And kids use calculators.
AskReddit,fk97bg6,t1_fk88xcu,1583970204.0,Haha. Yeah it was exciting! I have changed the battery once. Display is super clear now. And it was great being able to do sin then number instead of number then sin. And more than divide for fractions! But I am jealous of the fraction bar button on modern calculators. No more brackets for numerator and denominator! I might replace mine one day for that.

bipolar,fk0qti3,t1_fk0ku2k,1583764052.0,Yeah it would be good to see if they controlled for people who were suicidal before they took it. Of course it's also important to point out that this provides no information as to the proportion of users who attempted suicide. It just separates them into categories of how long they've taken the drug.

You're still working for the money, but you're in a privileged position being able to make this much. Recognising it is awesome, as you can see that many people will work their asses off and always struggle and it's not their fault. If you have some spare money, send it the way of those struggling, either through charity or directly. And keep enjoying your life."
