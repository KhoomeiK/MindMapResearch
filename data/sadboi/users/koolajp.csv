Thankfully he doesn't do it all the time but when he does it's peeing not spraying like you said, i believe it's still considered marking. I imagine it's probably worse in your situation cos your other cat is a female in heat, he can probably smell that and it might be driving him crazy. Do you have a feliway diffuser? It can help chill them out a bit. Also keep him busy, play with him lots and praise him when he uses his litterbox."
