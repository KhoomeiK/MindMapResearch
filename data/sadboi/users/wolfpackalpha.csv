I've known how to do an oil change for a while but never really done it myself because taking it to a shop was roughly the same price as me buying all the supplies to do an oil change. Well I was going on a trip and forgot to schedule an oil change appointment so figured time to do it myself since it'd be faster. I bought all the supplies to do an oil change, got under my car figuring it'd take only 15-30 minutes... Took me a full day.

I couldn't get the drain plug out, and it started stripping. It also broke my ratchet wrench set. So I cleaned up all the supplies, went to the autoparts store to get a socket set that specializes in getting stripped bolts off, got a new drain plug because I didn't want to put the old one back on once it did come off, and went to Lowe's to get some craftsman ratchet wrenches in case they broke again (since craftsman has lifetime warranties I believe). Got back, let the car cool a bit, set everything up again still couldn't get the thing off. Call my dad who was the last one to do the oil change to make sure I'm twisting the bolt the right way, dad chuckles and goes ""yeah I might've made it a little tight"". Go back to trying to get it off. At this point I'm literally hitting the wrench with a hammer to try and get it to budge even a little bit and it's just not. I get a friend who's super buff to try and get the bolt off, since I'm not very strong myself, and he began struggling. Eventually he got it to turn and from there I was able to get it the rest of the way off.

Drain the oil, take oil filter off, put new oil filter in, go to put new plug in...plug doesn't fit. Didn't want to put old one back on, all friends had left for Columbus day weekend (I'm in college so everyone I knew was leaving the college town). Walked back to auto parts store (about 2 miles each way so not terrible), got a different drain plug (the new new one had a bit of space between the top of the plug and where the threads started while the original new one did not). Go back, new new drain plug fits and I can put oil in my car again.


Started the whole thing at like, 10 am, finished at about 7/8 pm. Also decided never to do an oil change again lmao"

Even though porn is free there are a lot of people willing to pay for it apparently. I also think the hookup culture is kind of big around 20 then kind of matures. Like, at 20 you're usually in college or on your own for the first time, giving people plenty of chances to meet others and have as much sex as you want (well, as long as you're attractive. I am not lmao). But eventually people will figure out they want more steady relationships.

I always struggled because 1) I'm not very attractive (have been told by Reddit I'm a solid 5 or maybe even 4), and 2) I was never really interested in hookup culture. When I came to college seemingly everyone wanted hookups but after 2-3 years things kind of settled down. I have a friend who actually only wants hookups (and the first year he was here he was able to be with someone new nightly it seemed) but now about 2-3 years later he was telling me everyone he meets only wants relationships and he hates it

I'm not trying to say this to say how great I am, just I would expect other people to react similarly? Like, I get being disappointed because you know, boobs can be a huge turn on.

Like, for example if she called me up because she was in the area and her car broke down, sure yeah I'd go try to give it a jump start or something. But call me up and ask for money or something hell no.

And in life in general, there's people I know who don't care about me/ wouldn't do what I do for them back to me, and with those people I make sure to never over exert myself.

I don't know if this helps or not. It's hard to distance yourself from people you care about. But... Idk for me it seems like an easier task to put up boundaries than to try to cut feelings for someone 100%. I have a friend and she has issues putting up boundaries and staying away from guys who end up harming her. She similarly cares about people deeply who don't reciprocate. 

The biggest advice I have is learning it's okay to say no to people. It's okay for other people to fail in life, and it's not your fault. One way my friend will often get dragged into things is feeling like she must help the person, and if she doesn't then she feels horrible. But other people's life are not your responsibility. If someone wants to screw up their life that's entirely on them. It is not your job to fix people. Boundaries are important because they allow you to know when to stop with people. When you reach the point of a relationship is draining you way more than it's worth.   


So yeah, sorry if this is rambly but I hope it helps!"

VegasPro,fmc3jqi,t1_fmc0t0o,1585938237.0,"No worries, your question isn't dumb! And besides I like talking about PCs. So not going to lie your processor is a little on the slower side but it's not that bad. For a price budget of under $200 I'd definitely suggest the RAM though. The computer you linked says it has 8GB already, I would personally try to get 8 more (total of 16 GB of RAM). A couple of reasons I suggest RAM:

1. Generally cheaper than Processors
2. Easier to install than Processors-assuming you'd be doing the upgrading yourself, RAM literally just gets pushed into a slot where if you change your Processor you need thermal paste as well as need to make sure it's compatible with your Motherboard which can be a pain

If you know what you're doing, or have someone who does, the processor would not be a bad upgrade because seeing an i5 below a 3GHz clock speed is slow and video editing is intensive on the processor. However, RAM is also important and 8gb is also on the lower side. When i'm exporting/ using Vegas my RAM usage can get up to about 15gb sometimes (I have 32 so i've gone a bit overboard lmao).

If you're interested in upgrading your RAM, your primary concern is you have to make sure it is DDR4. I would suggest these:  [https://pcpartpicker.com/product/Tb97YJ/corsair-vengeance-lpx-8-gb-2-x-4-gb-ddr4-3000-memory-cmk8gx4m2c3000c16](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/Tb97YJ/corsair-vengeance-lpx-8-gb-2-x-4-gb-ddr4-3000-memory-cmk8gx4m2c3000c16)

If you're interested in upgrading your processor, I would suggest something like this (since your limit is $200):  [https://pcpartpicker.com/product/MBMwrH/intel-core-i5-9600kf-37-ghz-6-core-processor-bx80684i59600kf](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/MBMwrH/intel-core-i5-9600kf-37-ghz-6-core-processor-bx80684i59600kf)

Now, those suggestions being said, the link you provided does not give the full specs of your computer so I am unsure if either of  those parts would work. You might be out of RAM slots depending on what type of RAM came standard with your computer and how many slots the motherboard has. Similarly, the processor I suggested might not fit your motherboard, and without having more information I can't really tell you for certain one way or the other. If you're able to find out specifically what hardware you have you can use the site [pcpartpicker.com](https://pcpartpicker.com) to determine what parts would work with your system (You would put in all the parts you have, then for the RAM or Processor you would try to find something else). Pc Part Picker is designed to check and make sure parts work together so using that site should allow you to figure out if the parts will work together or not before buying.

A good way to find out what parts you have would be downloading this program:  [https://www.ccleaner.com/speccy](https://www.ccleaner.com/speccy) . It's usually for keeping an eye on heat levels in your computer but it'll also tell you what hardware you have. If you're able to get back to me on what exactly you have (you can PM me too if you don't want to share it here) i can put together a build on pcpartpicker for you

I hope that's helpful and if you have any other questions let me know!

Oh, also, I can not stress enough making sure you check to make sure you allocated more RAM use within Vegas. Screenshot of the preference here:  [https://i.imgur.com/VzoIDiu.png](https://i.imgur.com/VzoIDiu.png)  . It is be default set to 200 MB which is ridiculously low. The advice i've seen is make it roughly 1/3 of your Max Available RAM. There is roughly 1,000 MB in a GB so if you have 8 GB, 2,600 MB would be roughly a third. If you notice your computer is lagging heavily after this though, you might have to turn it a bit lower. Also, I had an issue where I changed the settings, hit apply, but had to restart vegas and do it again before it actually changed so even after you change it if nothing improves try exiting the program and trying again"

So say now I don't want the lighting kits to also be rainbow themed, is there a way to have them not be or is that when masking would come into play? Also, changing the opacity of the rainbow color for me just changes the opacity for both the rainbow and the dancing effect and so it ends up just making the person dancing disappear. I'm not quite sure if i'm doing something wrong or if that's what you meant. For changing the opacity i'm just using the opacity option on the video itself"

any who, I might be misunderstanding you. u/TurbinesAreAMust commented on my comment if you didn't see that and his solution might be what you're looking for. And for creating a moving mask you can just add key frames on that menu where the mask is so it moves along with your footage.

That being said, all the ways i'm thinking of are very brute-forcey so again there's probably someway to do motion tracking for a mask within vegas but I do not know what it is

VegasPro,fm6rypc,t3_ftdeaw,1585801578.0,"Vegas is a bit janky with getting this to work (if I'm understanding what you want to do correctly).

I would check how to do this but I'm currently exporting a video so I'm going to try to do it off memory. If you open up the menu on the video for keyframes/ to move the image around the screen, the track below keyframes should be called ""masking"". You click that and then create the mask you want around the guy dancing. 

Now the part that gets janky is I can never remember if you put the mask on the original video or the one you want to crop (in this case the rainbow) so mess around with which video track is on top/ bottom and which one has the mask. 

If I'm understanding you right, something similar I did was this: https://i.imgur.com/LSSjhpw.gifv 

Where the sparkling effect was only added to the text layer rather than the whole video. If you can wait until tomorrow morning I can create a video/ give you photos of how it's setup on my end but just in case you can't I wanted to try and give some sort of explanation now. Hope it helps!

Edit: sorry not sparkles it's the glow effect on the text layer rather than the whole thing"

Windscribe,fm5cwvr,t3_ft2ahj,1585770585.0,"Take this with a grain of salt because I also do not know the specifics of port forwarding and what it does but from my understanding:

Port forwarding allows people from outside of your network to access something on your computer, where otherwise it would've been blocked. I have a static IP and use port forwarding for hosting a Plex and Terraria server. Using Terraria as an example, when me and my friends want to play together they type in the Static IP address and then the port number I've set up, and it allows the game to connect to the server running off of my desktop computer. These ports are usually closed to prevent people from accessing things they shouldn't. Again, I don't know the super technical side of things so I might be over simplifying or have some stuff wrong.

As far as seeding is concerned, I appreciate that you're trying to be thoughtful and help seed torrents, but my honest advice would be forget about port forwarding for torrenting speeds. Torrenting by it's very nature is already a risky business and opening yourself up to extra potential harm isn't worth it IMO. I don't have the fastest internet and my seeding speed is still pretty good. Again, it's nice that you're trying to be helpful/ kind but I don't think opening up a port is really worth it."

If a little girl was crying to me about something i'd be similarly lost about what to say because I know any advice I could think of would probably not be helpful.  


That being said, if he truly did nothing that's where he becomes an asshole. I kind of find it hard to believe he did nothing at all. Like, his daughter was crying all day and he just what, sat in a different room with headphones on? did you mean he did nothing because the daughter was still upset? If he truly did nothing, and just ignored his crying child all day then I'd say he's definitely the asshole. I just have a hard time imagining someone is that heartless."
