Guildwars2,eyyvbri,t3_cz2qwh,1567602826.0,"TL;DR I'm not bitter that this isn't a real thing, concept is really cool. Just give anet their creative freedom to guide us through the world of tyria in their own way and their own time.

This concept is great for an expansion of course. But I think the whole rework for underwater stuff will come with time. Remember it took anet 4-5 years or so to give us gw2 in the first place. And what was holding them back for so long was doing the underwater environments.

Also note: they are moving forward depending on where the story writing takes them it seems. Game devs especially one with online communities will take feedback sure...but at the end of the day, they need to remember why they got into the business to make games in the first place. Guild wars 1 for example, those guys went forward with story telling and bringing us things that they wanted to make. We were just along for the ride, providing feed back and they made changes that fit with their vision.

It's similar to a band making music...the record label gets feedback from fans and relay it to the musicians...but they don't have to accept all of the feedback and change their whole flow because of it...they are going to keep on doing ""their thing"" and only giving the record label what they ask for to some degree...

This is no different. If the team feels that the story is taking them in one direction, that's the work they will sink their teeth into. And accepting feed back that helps to enrich their ideas for storytelling will be considered the most useful part.

I mean this is just my opinion on things. But if some of us were working on a project like this...let's face it. When it comes to artistic freedom, we would want to do it our way. Not just be at the mercy of the community to build it. The community is helpful to nurture and give the idea that the team has come up with, a better chance for success. That's about the extent of it."

Sohothin vs Magdaer as evident by that trailer towards the end there..."
depression,eyvqcjy,t1_eyvp91g,1567507426.0,"I'm not one to give advice but I thought I should share how your words make me feel, and how I see it.

For me it has been finding that first step, which may lead to something productive. The only way to know it, is if I feel passionate about knowing that I can find that step.

I found that I also have to let myself feel sad for a while, and if something like this has been rattling my mind for too long, it's just one big dark cloud that would be shrouding my emotions. It would feel like its draining me, so the thought of productivity would probably make anyone want to puke.

I found that crying helps temporarily anyway...some people cry and cry all the time and don't often get the clarity they need to find their footing on that first step. And also, don't worry about how far other people are in their lives. I do not try to hold myself to some standard that I feel like I should've met by now. 

Everyone gets to where they are going at their own pace. Besides its these experiences that makes us different from one another. By the time I get to where I think I am supposed to be going, I would have found something that others have yet to find."
depression,eyvph0r,t3_cml6ni,1567506265.0,"Have you ever seen a rain storm that just blocks out the sun for days maybe a week at a time, yet the rain won't come? You expect it to, but it never comes. Sometimes the clouds disperse enough for some sunlight to come through...And it always sneaks up on you too. You'll be too busy being distracted indoors with the shades closed, then you decide to look out the window, and it's super dark around noon. And you can just feel it, you know the rain storm is coming.

And just when the raindrops start falling, it's only like 1 drop of water every now and then...its not even a downpour. This may go on for a while, and then that's when the flood gates open. The rain just keeps coming, and it won't stop. Here you have this land that has been needing rain water for months...there has been a drought. And now it's being flooded, with heavy rain for days maybe even weeks...that's where I am right now, its sad, its angry, its scared, but most of all its relieved; its just letting go."
depression,eyvoul7,t3_cwl19g,1567505393.0,"If it's any consolation, the idea of being comfortable with death is normal for anyone. Some people feel this way even when they are happiest in life. Rather go off dead when happiest so that you don't have to feel the bad parts all over again. Because in life there are always bad parts. Death is also a peaceful thought. Knowing that no matter how bad things maybe, knowing that there is an official end to this particular journey, somehow makes it bearable enough to handle another day..."
depression,er2rbdy,t3_anh7tv,1560448521.0,"In my opinion, if two people make the conscious decision to bring another life into this world. For as long as those two people live, it's their responsibility to give that life a reason to want to be here, at least support them on finding out what that reason is. Because I for one didn't ask to be, none of us actually asked to be brought into the world, as far as we know. But those already existing, made that choice for us, that much we do know. So yea, I'm lonely, depressed."
