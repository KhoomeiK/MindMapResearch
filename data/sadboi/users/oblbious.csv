BPD,fjq21vu,t1_fjhuylf,1583565770.0,Currently starving myself again and it’s not helping. I’ve forced myself to write out a solid diet plan and work out to follow but I know that won’t last long -_-
BPD,fjq1wb9,t1_fjhlbfi,1583565602.0,I struggle with this so much it’s debilitating
BPD,fjq157q,t3_feq3pq,1583565197.0,I really hope you are okay and know as hard as it is to believe you aren’t alone and people do love you! I have been through almost exactly what you have mentioned. It’s terrifying to feel that way and bizarre because all you want is to feel. Please contact someone close to you i promise they will help remind you that you are loved
BPD,fjq0wkc,t3_feqpot,1583564960.0,Yup yup yup.
BPD,fjq0kzj,t3_feqyh9,1583564849.0,"I relate so much with this. I’m grateful for this subreddit for letting us vent and relate but it never fully feels right and I often still feel so alone no matter what. Living with bpd is a hell I wish there was a way to describe it to anyone who doesn’t have it but it never fully clicks. My rage over nothing and fear over tiny changes in people’s responses or attention to me is so draining. I’m so tired all of the time just trying to regulate my emotions over small
Or
Big things. All I can say is the least we can do is our best and that’s a lot more than most people do"
socialanxiety,fjnzckn,t3_fefk9f,1583517373.0,This happens with me anytime I have to answer a phone call related to jobs/appointments. I sound confident and reply quickly via email then pace around wishing to god it actually doesn’t happen and then have to actually answer.
socialanxiety,fjnz36k,t1_fjl6r45,1583517221.0,This. This is the only way I can get through things with out canceling. Right out of the gate into an appointment I’m just like “haha sorry so I’m really anxious and I know I don’t have to be but that’s why I’m being weird”
socialanxiety,fjnywv1,t3_fdzgdr,1583517121.0,I went to an eye exam appointment yesterday and the strength it took me to get out of the car was insane. The interaction was awkward due to how anxious I was and how talkative they were but I DID IT AND I RAN OUT OF THERE.
bipolar,fjnyfxj,t3_feeblw,1583516849.0,Hello! I’ve been on a combo of Zoloft adderal and ability then Wellbutrin was added. It made me full after eating something as small as some carrots or a can of tuna fish and I felt bloated and nauseous for hours after.
ExNoContact,fjny91e,t1_fjny5t7,1583516740.0,You got this! If he does this again then possibly get a restraining order? It’s unfair and emotionally triggering.
ExNoContact,fjnxync,t3_fegujx,1583516568.0,My ex narc did this to me out of the blue after staying no contact with him for 4 months after I kicked him out and he moved in with the new supply. He knocked and asked if we could be friends.. out of the BMI at 4 am. I didn’t open the door either.  I think you should be proud of not opening the door and sticking to no contact!
BPD,fjnxkhc,t1_fjlz4qk,1583516340.0,Bored is certainly a word I would use for it Uhg
BPD,fjilwf0,t1_fji9gys,1583370516.0,Thank you!
BPD,fji6h49,t1_fji5sqd,1583361414.0,"

I love this subreddit! It’s helped
Me through so much in reminding me in not alone in this struggle but lately I even feel bad for trying to post about how I feel or what’s going on because I feel like no one actually will care to read it (I know that’s no true) but even responding right now I feel bad lol I just want to converse, rant, and overall vent about how insane it is to feel all the symptoms on full blast"
BPD,fji1q0y,t1_fjheh1s,1583359101.0,"Me too! And that’s the worst. Like you want to open and up and vent to a good friend or family member since you can’t hold in anymore
How stressful it is you went from “today is amazing I’m alive looking alive!!” To “holy shit no no no no is that my reflection? AHH am I walking weird?” And they are like “Uhg yeah that sucks.”"
BPD,fjhf1w1,t3_fd984c,1583346863.0,"I think we are the same person. This literally is what I go through and am currently having an issue with my first non toxic relationship. I’m almost speechless after reading my exact thoughts, actions, past and present written by another person. I’m so sorry this is happening to you but you are not alone. You deserve to be loved and to feel your feelings are valid no matter how insane they seem due to growing up thinking “if I show emotions I will be punished”. You are doing great by opening up about it."
BPD,fjhdy7c,t3_fdfrvc,1583346263.0,This literally just happened to me. I had such an amazing day with the nice weather. I felt confident and motivated overwhelmingly positive..then the days fallowing I just feel like a disgrace to society. I can’t even look at my own reflection and feel bad people have to look at me. The crippling paranoia that everyone I love hates me and everyone who doesn’t know me thinks I’m crazy just because of how off I act in oh live when I feel like this. I’m sorry you are going through this too
BPD,fg2n3wo,t3_ewivxf,1580448646.0,Currently doing so. Super sick: loving and hating myself every five seconds for it
BPD,fg2mwm9,t3_ew84gl,1580448461.0,I do this constantly.. I’ve been through so many therapists and have the most wholesome understanding one that understand BPD and I split hard on her because I didn’t feel good enough to talk about my stupid shameful shit feels because she is so nice
bipolar,fg2mnk9,t1_fg2mbol,1580448261.0,Yupperooni
bipolar,fg2mmdf,t3_ewikiz,1580448234.0,I miss my creative mania so much. I haven’t had it in so long. I just get dyspeptic mania these days.
BPDmemes,fg2mjze,t3_ewinio,1580448181.0,Well fuck
adderall,ffxw74t,t1_ff3j634,1580333624.0,That was my recent med recipe and it felt like I was a hungry tired emotionless thing
BPD,f7kkekh,t1_f7kg61s,1573815158.0,I wish I knew what true happiness was. I’m so sorry you feel this bizarre struggle. It’s like I don’t feel like myself if I’m doing the right things or acting the right way.
BPD,f7kbelx,t3_dwkzov,1573801772.0,I go through making up perfect explanations to explain why I am the way I am and what’s triggered me and why what Evers triggered me to absolutely hating every god damn second of even having to think of trying to tell someone how I feel and why I feel that way because that bubble bursted two hours ago and the residue of that bubble isn’t worth even trying to bring up... Hope that makes sense. Just impulsively posting and not letting myself re read what I’m posting
BPD,f244b99,t3_dbhrco,1569944609.0,"My boyfriend didn’t say he missed me back and isn’t responding as enthusiastically so now My brain wants me to be distant and believe he decided I’m too crazy or annoying.. instead of the logical answer that his job is very difficult 
, time consuming, frustrating and important.  I do this with literally everyone from family to friends. “Oh you didn’t respond as quickly and excitedly as I did...WHAT DID I DO? DID YOU REALIZE IM THE WORST ?!?” 

It’s draining as hell"
BPD,evuyu14,t3_clf38v,1564811520.0,"Relate in so many ways but also don’t want to get into it all because that means accepting I feel feelings and I’m finna not feel so I can attempt
A healthy life.. and repeat being a sponge that eventually is no longer able to absorb."
BPD,evuxrih,t3_clel12,1564810286.0,Yes.
bipolar,evuxpyt,t3_clenfb,1564810237.0,This just stabbed me in all the places
BPD,evux8ne,t3_cj8y8r,1564809693.0,YUP
BPD,evux70e,t3_cdsb1r,1564809642.0,I’m in a similar boat. I’ve been dating this guy for a month now.. and he’s been nothing but amazing but I can’t keep up my “amazing” personality he seems to adore. Tonight I’ve started testing the waters of crazy he can deal with but feel ashamed.  I feel guilty that I feel relieved he’s asleep right now... because I just want to be crazy. He drunkenly said a few things that made me want to split.. and I hate myself for it. Wtf even is healthy relationships?
bipolar,esm3hgm,t1_eslzhic,1562097454.0,I studied psych too.  Associates degree. Why did you get into studying psychology? Do you feel it has been an unhealthy habit for you to learn about mental illness?
bipolar,esew9b7,t3_c7fsp3,1561911123.0,Yes especially in my face. My ears turn fire truck red.
BPD,esed9sv,t3_c7bpx3,1561894007.0,"I’m currently 24 and it’s officially the worst it’s ever been in my life. Currently have no steady job and often avoid daily life activities such as .. getting groceries, or going for a walk because I feel so
Uncomfortable in my own skin and don’t want anyone to see me. I usually feel better after I force myself to take long walks but the anxiety lingers"
BPD,esecu2c,t3_c7bpx3,1561893431.0,"This is one of my biggest issues. It’s insane how much my physical appearance dictates my personality in public. I’m constantly anxious over how I look bad/crazy and can’t even trust myself even when I do feel confident. 

My weight fluctuates a lot and with that fluctuates my ability to comfortably go outside. It’s torture."
bipolar,es3n62k,t3_c5rpqp,1561566347.0,I don’t have any healthy tips besides maybe try going for a long walk until the physical exhaustion overpowers the mania and you knock out. I’m sorry you are going through this.
socialanxiety,er6lvxt,t3_c0phad,1560550816.0,Hell year!

socialanxiety,eq450cv,t3_bx80af,1559769353.0,Needed to see this thank you
bipolar,epxez35,t3_bw2smk,1559599040.0,I also am blown away by that. Must be the magic of the bipolar mixed episode spending.  And thank you! Honestly really needed to hear(read)that. I hope you get out of the mixed episode hell safe and sound. Also am happy to know you have your dog and husband! Dogs are life savers
BipolarReddit,epxa31h,t3_bwfgpd,1559595626.0,This is like one of my biggest issues that holds me back from succeeding. Been trying to make a decent living off of art commissions so I can stay at home instead of impulsively quitting a job I didn’t even want to get but got out of anxiety of being a mentally disordered loser and then my anxiety over doing the job makes me quit.
BPD,epx9lp6,t1_epwbz2b,1559595298.0,Yeah I’m going to try getting back into the swing of normal healthy eating because I can’t handle the self hate when ever I end up binging everything in my home. Going to do my best!
bipolar,epx9g8i,t1_epwhpuy,1559595194.0, Nothing beats the mixed state life
bipolar,epx9e79,t1_epwznn6,1559595156.0,Haha Uhg yup
BPD,epx9ba1,t1_epvw23l,1559595100.0,I relate to all of this so much.
bipolar,epvuhyk,t1_epvuauu,1559551768.0,Exactly! I save so many memes I find that I would be a relatable hit but I feel Ike it’s wrong to share. That’s unreal you are working in social media marketing but also you deserve a million high fives for getting into all of that
BPD,epvtznp,t1_epvtv2c,1559550864.0,I’ve been there! My impulsive posts in fo would bring the big concern to family. I no ombré want to share my opinions or personal shit With people who could give two shits or have  something to say that would make me feel bad
BPD,epsaezn,t3_bvsibn,1559442452.0,Like wise. I hate but find comfort in seeing someone go through what I feel like I deal with alone that makes me want to make a me sized whole in the wall
BPD,eps8wyf,t3_bvsibn,1559441152.0,I relate to this so so so much. I wish I had good advice to give but I’m in the same boat. It’s a constant struggle living everyday like this. All I can hope is good things to come your way!
socialanxiety,epocxdy,t3_bvdb57,1559342223.0,This happens to me even with family. When I et anxious I won’t be good at talking then my brain makes it happen and the judgment g how weird is eek by not communicating normally makes it even worse. I’ll focus too much on how to respond like a normal person and it just comes off like I am a malfunctioning robot.
NarcissisticAbuse,epdxp5y,t3_bug0bo,1559176005.0,Narcs are fucking absurd like that. Mine showed up knocking on my door at 4:30 am after 4 months no contact and he had already moved in with the new supply.. they are bizarre creatures and do the unimaginable. I hope it doesn’t happen to you again!
