Baking,fqw2q8u,t1_fqvwhcq,1589691211.0,"Pretty simple!! 6 cups flour, 1 cup starter, 1 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon salt, 2 cups water, 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup oil. Add water a half cup at a time– dough should be sticky, but not runny. Mix until flour is incorporated, rise overnight in a large oiled bowl. Next morning, cut into three pieces and work some flour into each. Roll them out into rectangles, brush with flour, cover with cinnamon sugar. Roll them up like a jelly roll, slice, place in pan, let rise for 3-5 hours. Bake at 350 for 15-25 mins. I used melted cream cheese icing as a glaze because why not. They taste better when you share them with somebody you love."

movies,fcm1dr1,t3_ef4qsw,1577761696.0,"Absolutely stunning sound editing and cinematographic choices with the microscopic scale. Incredible performance from Sandler, but as I’ve seen here there’s just nothing redeeming about Howard’s character aside from any sympathy you might have for him just trying to get by. He’s a cheating asshole who gets into more than he can handle and doesn’t have the confidence to pull any of it off. The way Sandler plays him with the awkward and nervous nuance is really brilliant and adds a lot to the film, especially its ending. I won’t soon forget KG’s line that $100k might be five lifetimes to an Ethiopian Jew, but $1 million is a lot more. Plenty of moments to question the tension between antisemitism and outright racism or sexism. As usual, A24 pulls off a complex and visually elegant field that leaves us will lots to consider."
