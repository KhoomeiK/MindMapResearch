I don’t want kids. I never wanted kids and will likely never want any. It’s very obvious to me because I have a lot of different reasons. 

One of them being that I am pretty sure I would be the type of mom who generates a seriously mentally ill person. I would not be able to love the baby and babies need love. 

I think you did the right thing by giving her for adoption. So many great people want babies and most of them are probably amazing parents. 

I’d say take your time but you should reply to her an be honest and kind. I don’t want kids but I have empathy for other human beings and she is one. 

Maybe people who have been adopted can tell you what they would have liked to hear and how. I don’t think you should lie but there are different ways to tell the truth. Some might be less hurtful.

If you don’t have depressive thoughts you can try the exercises when you feel empty or blank. Then you can force yourself to think about something nice instead. Again it doesn’t have to be amazing. None of us really have amazing lives haha. Focusing on little things like “I’ve seen a cute dog on Reddit” or “I like the color of the walls in my room” is enough!"
depression,fo0ue16,t1_fo0rys9,1587419939.0,"Just try to notice when you are having depressive thoughts... and then try to fight them. 

So let’s say that everyday when you look at the mirror you think “I am ugly”. Tomorrow you’re gonna realize that it is something you think everyday. So you’re gonna try to fight that idea because it’s wrong - Nobody is ugly. If it’s too hard you can take a baby step and think of a way to like at least something. with small changes you  can already feel better (hairstyle that you like, makeup etc). Instead of thinking “I am ugly” you’ll have to focus on thinking something like “ok i am not as pretty as I would like to be BUT I do REALLY like my eyes though.. and I could wear some makeup to make them look even nicer”. It might not be an appropriate example for you but I hope it explains the idea. 

Also my last therapist told me to have a little notebook: Every night I had to write down a list of nice things that happened during the day. And I had to find something even if I thought that everything went wrong/was shitty. It doesn’t have to be on a notebook or only at night. When you feel very low during the day you can stop and try to find at least 2-3 things that are nice and try to focus on them. It can be “stupid” such as “I just ate a good meal, I won a video game fight, the sun is out today, I received a message from my best friend this morning etc”. It will helps you to focus on the nice little things"

Have you tried writing your feelings down and giving it to him? You got married to this person so you must have had a connection with him at some point. If you let him know that you need him he could try to help you.

Maybe him helping you could just be him saying « I acknowledge your feelings, I wish I could help you but I don’t know how/can’t. I love you.”"
depression,fo0ra1a,t3_g51iki,1587418298.0,"There’s not necessarily a reason why... Sometimes it’s not your fault nor anyone’s fault.  And it’s doesn’t have to be anyone or anything’s fault. It’s ok to feel depressed without a reason because it’s not rational. 

To me it’s how your brain is wired atm. it’s like a learning process. Involuntary your brain learned to think something (aka. depressive thoughts) when something happens (aka pretty much anything). It’s hard to untrain the brain but it’s possible. Sometimes you need help (meds, therapy etc) cause it’s fucking hard to do it yourself (source - I’ve tried).

Sorry if that didn’t make any sense...

depression,fo0pup8,t1_fo0p5t3,1587417550.0,Well maybe. But maybe he could be willing to get better at listening OP because OP needs it. As someone who often has to deal with depressive feelings I cannot always be here for my partner when he needs me...

The pandemic has been really hard for everyone and it didn’t help a lot of couples. I have been fighting a lot with my bf because of it and we don’t even live together. 

I am not a therapist and probably not good enough to help but if you need to vent I can listen and try to help you.

Have you checked if there is a mental health service open around where you live? Maybe try to find out so you can have the number in case things don’t go well with your partner"

I m not usually a happy person but I usually manage to keep my depression level low.. since covid-19 it’s been out of control. 

I assume your parents are quite understanding for 
letting you see a therapist? Maybe you could ask them to help you find one you could meet up on Skype. It might not be perfect but could help you get through this situation (Maybe you can do it yourself if you’re independent financially). 

Did your last therapist gave you some tips on what to do when you have a panic/laughing attack?"
depression,fo0ng8q,t3_g50qeu,1587416281.0,"Hey, 

It’s probably nervous? I’m not a doctor so I wouldn’t know better sorry. 

Have you ever thought about getting help (therapy/counseling?). I’m not saying that to be judgmental (My head is so fucked up I’d need 2 lives worth of therapy to get better) don’t take it the wrong way. 

There’s probably nothing wrong with you. Being depressed and/or anxious is human...

I fear for the old people here because they will be last in line to get treatment when things are going to be really bad. And they will."
TrueOffMyChest,fko8pos,t1_fko6xs3,1584382303.0,It is a big problem everywhere. The UK doesn’t have a special natural resistance to it. They have as many cases as other countries and it’s not gonna get better considering that they’re not doing slightly enough to stop the virus from spreading.
TrueOffMyChest,fko8fxq,t1_fko7s1o,1584382148.0,"Yep, and then they’re like « oh look how great our strategy works we don’t have any cases ».... yet"
TrueOffMyChest,fko0iuh,t3_fjhyzv,1584377690.0,Thanks so much for respecting the self isolation rules. Goodluck - you’re gonna get better soon!!

It’s hard to tell on this photo"
insects,fkilub3,t3_fionff,1584223065.0,Kinda looks like a beetle with the pronotum? Looks flightless too. I’d be curious to know what it is :)

I live abroad and I just want to come back home to see my mom who hasn’t been feeling well lately."
AmItheAsshole,fjy1eec,t1_fjxjucp,1583687885.0,"I mean.. to be fair I understand her « road food » idea after the gym. I exercise at least 4-5 times a week and am pretty skinny. This morning I spent 1.30 at the gym and I went to do my weekly groceries before lunch. I was starving (had my breakfast at 7am) so I bought myself a cereal bar (only a 90 calories ones though) so I could carry my bags home without fainting.

I am not saying an extra burger is healthy though (obs). she should have either got an healthy snack to wait for dinner or eaten her meal in the car."
AmItheAsshole,fi9p4z3,t3_f77rta,1582275370.0,"YTA - intelligence is so much more complex than just understanding maths and being good at school. Plus, you definitely have no social intelligence as you’re able to say to your own twin  sister that you’re smarter than her. 

Hope the answers here will help you to be a better person. You need to grow up"
