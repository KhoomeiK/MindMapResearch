Shes introverted, she doesn't always come across the most friendly (which.. same), she's a bit awkward... but she does her own thing, she works really hard and she always comes across honest about who she is. And she's insanely talented! 

Moving Parts definitely solidified my love/bordering obsession and it's only grown with all her quarantine content! She's even streaming my favourite videogame!"

depression,fiszzg8,t3_f9awv8,1582698843.0,"I felt exactly this way for years since splitting up with my last ex - I've never been attracted to many people in my whole life though (31 years) ... I think it's just how I'm wired. I need a connection and to feel comfortable with  person to feel physically attracted to them, and that connection seems to be super rare to find.

That said I have just met somebody I am attracted to and consequently now can't sleep, feel sick and like shit, like I'm losing my mind ... So I am really kind of missing feeling numb to it all right now. I forgot how horrible this feeling is.

Somebody will come into your life that will remind you that attraction is still possible. It's taken 4 years for me."

depression,fgzfwcn,t3_f0qiyq,1581193820.0,"I struggle with this all the time. It keeps me awake some nights.

I'm 31 and single. I now have a job that pays me enough to be comfortable and my main goal is to save enough to buy my own house.. but I worry what I'll have left to work for once I attain that. 

I'm female so kids are something that are now rapidly out of reach for me. I'm not sure I ever wanted it but I've also never had the option. I'd never have a kid without a partner and I've never had the right partner. Now I'm getting too old.

I have a few friends but they don't live nearby any more and they all have their own lives increasingly different to mine with their partners and kids. I have nobody around that I feel is ""in"" my life. I spent 99% of time alone. What's the point when you're alone? 

I try to meet new people but it's really not that easy.

The whole idea of life you see on TV and in movies - that I see other people living - with families, with best friends around they can call on ... That's never going to be me.

Just got keep the darkness away with my creative hobbies and keep plugging away hoping something might change if I keep trying to get out and meet people. Its all we can do."
misophoniasupport,fgwbnfp,t1_fgugom8,1581159205.0,"The UK is too small and too densely populated for us all to be detached! I grew up on a farm in the countryside in the pitch black and silence, moving to towns with street lights and neighbours took adjusting... I sleep soooo well when I visit my parents!

Last night next door was making a weird sporadic and not too loud knock/scratch on my bedroom wall and I could not work out what he was doing - that was making me feel crazy! ... Had to get the ear plugs out to get to sleep.

I don't think next door have any idea how much noise I get from them.

We just all need soundproofed party walls, floors and ceilings... 

Thank you, the same to you!"

loneliness,fgskadp,t3_evo0wr,1581086461.0,"I have the same problem. Finding opportunities is so hard!

I've tried Meet Up but the only group I found that interests me a is a Book Club that only meets once a month. It gets me out the house, the people are nice and the discussions are brilliant .. I do feel a part of the Group - but there is nobody to ""click"" with or try to spin into a real friendship. We don't talk outside of the group.

Because there weren't any that worked for me I tried my own Meet Up group for a year meeting weekly but there was nobody there I found a real connection with (not one that lasted beyond them finding a girlfriend!).

Over the last year I made one good friend who I actually met through online dating - after a month we quickly reaslised we don't work as as couple but stayed good friends.

If you like sports thats a good way to meet people?  
(Unfortunately I really don't like sport so not an option for me)

If you have anything in your area perhaps volunteering?  
(Again I tried this avenue but there isn't anything in my area that works around office hours)

I think we just have to keep plugging away at it.. I recently met a ""potential"" at another Meet Up group. Only the two of us showed up to that one but gave us a chance to really chat and felt like we clicked - managed to exchange numbers and met up again last week so I'm hoping I can now figure out how I translate that into a real friendship...! 

So many of us seem to be so lonely... if only it was easier to find each other."

misophoniasupport,fgsb6dz,t1_fgs66jm,1581079174.0,"I didn't say before but well one for going to talk to you neighbours!

I've never properly met my neighbours but I have decided they are all dicks and I hate them! If they played music I liked I wouldn't mind quite so much... there used to be a girl who lived there who sang show tunes. I didn't mind that - except when it was ""All That Jazz"" for 30 minutes straight.

I think because I know the Skyrim ""sounds"" its quite comforting. I found a 'podcast' on Spotify that loops them so there are no breaks between the tracks. I just pop some of those onto a playlist for the night. If you have a subscription search for Skyrim ambience it should come up. There is a night sounds version and a towns one. I think they're 1-2 hours each.

If when I go to bed they are talking (or other stuff) I have to have ear plugs and the music.

I feel more settled now with sleeping since I have a plan to manage it I get less psyched up - and I got enough sleep again to feel I can manage the gym which also helps be more tired at night. It took a few months of misery though - even if its quiet at night your body/brain its probably stuck on high alert for anything that would wake you up. 

Its so hard when you don't get sleep :(

I really hope you can find something that helps!"
misophoniasupport,fgs428o,t3_ezx1hp,1581070523.0,"I've had a similar problem for the last few months - though not as bad as you - so I can definitely sympathise with how much stress this causes.

This is long - sorry!

I live in the UK in an semi-detached old house that is converted into flats, I'm on the ground floor. Upstairs are OK and the noise of people just walking about doesn't seem to bother me. It's next door that is the problem. I think its a house share and they're all in the 20s with a group of ""lads"". Their house through my wall sounds like a cave so I don't think they have any carpets. In my living room I can hear them talking, I can hear them putting plates away and turning on sockets. Sometimes they play loud music. I have to turn my TV right up to cover their talking, louder than I'd really like it.

The worse thing though is about 6 months ago a new person moved into the room that shares a wall with my bedroom. I can hear EVERYTHING he does in there. Practically hear conversations, when he has his girlfriend around... I swear I even could hear him wrapping christmas presents. He does have a penchant for EXTREMELY loud music (somebody gave him a new speaker for Christmas) and its the type of music I have which is extremely bassy and vibrates my flat (I hate this music, it makes me feel like I'm going to have a heart attack). If it is a unreasonable time or way too loud  I knock on the wall he will turn it off, thankfully.

The worst thing is I don't classify 90% of this noise as ""unreasonable"" it's just the normal noise of people living in a house but I reckon its a just all shitty landlord hard flooring in high ceiling open plan room with no carpets or decent furninute to stop the sound all just coming through my wall. I don't feel I can go around and ask them to not talk in their own home! I also rent so I can't do much on my side either (I do have carpets!). I'm trying to save to buy my own house where I can line party walls with book cases!

I bet a lot of people wouldn't be so bothered by it but voices will wake me up 100% of the time. Often I get to sleep only to be woken up later by him talking or having sex with his girlfriend (or watching porn, somtimes hard to tell)! This lead to a lot of anxiety about being able to sleep through the night and I felt like total shit for about 3 months hoping my body would adjust and let me sleep. And being tired and more stressed also made me even more irritated by my very noisy loud eating colleague in the office!

I now also get anxiety at the weekend over whether I can have a nice quite time in or if I'll have to suffer hearing those idiots messing about next door and playing music all day (music I can't stand too!). I feel so trapped by it.

Sorry for jumping on your rant with my own - a long way of saying, I know how horrible this is! You are not alone.

Anyway - I ended up with ear plugs for times when I can tell he has somebody over when I go to bed and I now always go to sleep with some soothing music on set to play for 2-3 hours. I tried white noise or fans but it actually stresses me out more! The ambience sounds from the Skyrim soundtrack do the trick for me. If I can't drop off then I'll also have one of the Headspace app Sleepcasts on as I find those voices more soothing to focus on."
