Showerthoughts,ff0i85r,t3_dywu35,1579469140.0,this post did't get attention cuz the average person does't know what the Hedonic treadmill is even though they are running on it :')
depression,ff0faxy,t3_eqs4h8,1579468305.0,"it's called Hedonic Treadmill..

and we're biologically stuck with it.

basically for our survival it was best to always be doing something new, and never truly appreciate the condition we're in..

so, if you reach an objective you're happy for a while, if u screw up you feel sad for a while.. but in the end you eventually return to your ""base level"" of happiness.. (which for some people is a unfairly low level)

btw, it used to be useful to our ancestors.. but in modern socitey it kinda sucks...

afterall we humans didn't get a ""CPU Update"" for a while.. an this ""Modern Society"" Games just cant run smoothly on such old creatures."

just.. sometimes it feels disheartening to throw so much work in the ""void"""

depression,ev2d41v,t1_ev1tpib,1564174695.0,"I can imagine the feeling.. had similiar experiences a couple times..
then stopped forcing myself.. 
or at least in those rare occasions i go out I make sure there is alcohol avaible, which usually makes me a way more sociable person.

I mean.. I know it's bad, and i still feel a coward
But at least i'm making an effort i guess..

I never cut myself.. cause I have aichmophobia so i'm fkin' scared of needles and superficial cuts :')"
depression,ev1msbg,t3_ci52eo,1564161531.0,"I'm kinda in the same crappy situation

It feels like a loop:

The more i disconnect from social situations the more i feel like im becoming socially awkward

Which even more prevents me from getting in touch with people.

Has anyone figured a way out?"
