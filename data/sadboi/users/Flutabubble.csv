I have PTSD (not from sexual abuse) and I've finally gotten to a point where I can breathe a bit better and feel optimistic about life. The trick is patient persistence. Be kind to yourself.

Ingredients:

1 & 3/4 cups / 358g all purpose flour  
1/3 cup / 67g granulated sugar  
3/4 teaspoon salt  
1/2 cup / 113g cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces  
2 cups unfed starter  
2 tbs oil (instead of 1 large egg)  
1 tsp vanilla extract  
1 tbs heavy cream or milk  
2 tbs coarse sugar (I used turbinado / raw sugar)

&#x200B;

1. In a large bowl, whisk flour, sugar, and salt together
2. Cut cold butter into flour until it reaches a sandy texture
3. Gradually add liquid ingredients and combine.
4. Gently knead the dough for or five times (mine required a bit more). Form dough into a flat 7"" circle.
5. Cut into 8 triangles
6. Store triangles in plastic bag overnight in refrigerator.
7. Arrange scones 2"" apart on baking sheet lined with parchment paper or brush pan with olive oil (this is what I did).
8. Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.
9. Brush the tops of the scones with milk or cream and sprinkle with course sugar. Bake for 15 - 20 minutes until golden brown. Let cool and serve immediately."

Find some freelance or very low hour part time work (so your parents don't find out) and have the money deposited into the new account. Don't spend the money. Save it for either when your parents cut you off or you get to a point where you can sustain yourself independently.

This was how I got out of the emotional and financial abuse I went through, and I'm so glad I had that nest egg.

In the meantime, survive as best as you can. Have a plan ready in case you get cut off before you can sustain yourself. Ask a friend if they would let you stay on their couch in exchange for cooking and groceries while you get back on your feet.

Second, you need to speak to a lawyer since you were trapped into this. Find any texts, emails, or any other documentation that alludes to the child free agreement you made. Don't let her touch your phone or any electronic devices. Back up these communications. 

Third, please see a therapist as I'm sure this is psychologically damaging after such a huge breach of trust. This will help you in the process of moving on. If the therapist tries to talk you into being a dad to the child (even though you clearly don't want to), change therapists. As a woman, I had a therapist berate me for wanting to be childless - I fired him and now have a supportive therapist. 

Best of luck. I hope everything works out as well as it can!"
