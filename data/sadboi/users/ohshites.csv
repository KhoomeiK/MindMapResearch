Tho habang tumatagal, napapansin mong manipis na tapos mas mahal ang price compared to before. Lol"
BokuNoHomoAcademia,fmrsod8,t3_fuvfxl,1586334036.0,Todoroki's tats and long hair ❤️❤️❤️
BokuNoHomoAcademia,fmrsmtk,t1_fmk66aj,1586333994.0,Same here. I actually love to listen to their voice actors' radio in YouTube. It's not yaoi related. But I just love listening to them talk since we don't have that much DekuShouto interaction in the BNH anime.
BokuNoHomoAcademia,fmrsgmu,t1_fmrjy5m,1586333817.0,I knowww. Can't really picture Deku smoking. A reversal play maybe?
yaoi,fmrs9xw,t1_fmrityp,1586333628.0,Isn't she amazing? I follow her IG handle. ❤️❤️

(Prolly binge-reading your stories is somewhat bad for my heart. But I enjoyed it all. Thank you. 

I bet majority of us here are rooting for you guys! Stay sweet\~"
alasjuicy,fmrj8cw,t3_fvapay,1586324867.0,"Congrats, you cute couple!

Love how engaging your stories are! :D Looking forward to your next stories. No pressure though; may COVID-19 pa. Keep safe, you guys.

PS: Actually, nakaka-enjoy ring magbasa ng mga comments dito. Hahaha"

alasjuicy,fmq7hwg,t1_fmq6m7b,1586294313.0,"Aw, no pressure.😊 

Halfway through reading it, I was thinking. Do I know these guys? (I had a dorm mate who shared something like this. I panicked a little while reading. Haha.) Then you guys went all the way. Ah, nope, not someone I know. All they did was hug."
alasjuicy,fmq6m8b,t1_fmomerh,1586293838.0,"I feel you. 😣 Sa araw-araw, nauubusan din ng ideas on how to make it more ""exciting""."

alasjuicy,fmoorzc,t1_fmon31r,1586265111.0,"Not fully yet. Well, if there is a convention for BL, maybe i'd swing by. Any manga recommendations?"
phr4r,fml76z9,t3_fvx388,1586180288.0,Upvote for the imaginative intro. 👏
alasjuicy,fml3wdx,t3_ffv4md,1586177938.0,"HAHAHAHA. Oh my, this is a gem. Yes, it's a killer mood but kinda cute (depends on the anime, I guess). Imagine if he played the Yu Yu Hakusho (Ghost Fighter) or Sailormoon theme song. But ah, he did play Doreamon (man, that's the best one).

Hm. I think I haven't experienced that. But Eureka7 played on TV when we were having sex. Does that count?"
alasjuicy,fml1mmu,t1_flrdirm,1586176162.0,"Same here. 😩 Or if you do get aroused, it's doesn't last long and it dries up. Man, that hurts a lot. LOL. I don't know whether we should be amused or frustrated about this tho."
