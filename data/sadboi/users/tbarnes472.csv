I don't know if you have a therapist but as soon as you can look into one who works with those two things. 

In the meantime, if you can safely do it, I would consider journaling just to get the thought process out so you can see it. 

Most people experience those thoughts on a completely subconscious level and they begin to be their reality instead of naming it as abuse.

CPTSDFightMode,fn2u3n9,t3_fyuhcj,1586603365.0,"I really really REALLY appreciate this post. Thank you. 

I was 19 and 6 months pregnant with my son the last time my mother crossed the room at me. For the first time in my life I pushed her back and I remember looking her in the eyes and telling her if she ever touched me or my child again I would kill her. 

It was the forst time I had ever physically defended myself against her. It was also the first timw she didn't tell my father, her enforcer, he's wildly interesting but when it came to her he was  huge, terrifying, and if she told him I had touched her he would have seriously hurt me. 

For the first time ever I stood up for myself and I meant it. She never got physically intimidating with me again. 

My son is 23 now, I have two other kids. My son is her favorite. Hes ALWAYS stood up to her and she adores him for it. He is also totally supportive of me being no contact. 

She was diagnosed as a sociopath when I was 11 or 12. Back before it was called ASPD. She was always totally honest with me about how her head worked and I'm her only daughter that can and will precisely call her out and have her listen. 

I had never threatened her before. I had never been that calm either. 

She must have believed me because she turned into a model grandparent and while I never had to remind her tbat I absolutely would cut contact and never let her see her grandchild again, I definitely had to keep consistent boundaries with her. 

The biggest and most sacred was that if she or my sister's told me a different story than my son did, his version won. 

I didnt care if he was two. That kid always had a flair for rolling his eyes at her when she was playing language games and I never ever ever believed them over him. 

It was self defense and I survived and I made sure my kids would never be in that same place. Thank you for reminding me that I wasnt violent or aggressive. I was defending myself and my child. 

I have been through a lot of therapy but Ive never talked about that incident. I guess I need to do that. 

Thank you."

CPTSD,fg0ec4w,t3_ew2wkm,1580406014.0,This may be unpopular but it's how I've always felt and most of my therapists are not huge fans of my bottom line on this. I don't like it because it allows people to keep their fairy tale views on human nature. I believe that well over 90 percent of people who hurt others in a systematic way enjoy it like most people enjoy sex and drugs. And that belief is really unpopular. We call it enjoying power or control or being motivated by those things but what that means to the people effected is pain and fear. I absolutely believe that some people are just damaged and cause abuse by not controlling their emotions but some are in control. What everyone seems to miss is that a lot of the time that damage creates personality disorders like ASPD and people with those actually ENJOY what they are doing. So by that point I don't give a hoot if they were hurt as kids. It doesn't matter. Their impact on their environment overrides the injustice of where their damage came from. My mom got a sociopath diagnosis back when I was 11 and long before it was ASPD. I'm 42 now. She used me for therapy so I ended up with a really interesting insight and while I have a lot of empathy my boundaries with her are insanely tight.  She would constantly minimize her behavior by saying she is a product of her environment. I remember being about 11 and telling her that her intentions do not remove her responsibility to the consequences of her actions. That's probably the single strongest boundary I kept with her over my lifetime. We are no contact now. At a certain point hurt people very often enjoy what they are doing to hurt others.

ptsd,ffuztnl,t3_ev4ifw,1580252513.0,"This is definately therapist territory. Having said that this one is pretty easy to understand where its coming from. We constantly tell girls that they need to avoid situations where they will be assaulted and each time it happens we act like they should have seen it coming. She is being told that she is asking for this by being in a relationship. In reality she was groomed into being a victim and its by no means a relationship. But to her and to probably most people around her, it looks consensual. She needs therapy because there is no way to unravel this without professional help. Has she actually said that men are entitled to rape? Is that a direct quote or is it what the rest of her thinking boils down to? Again though, most Christian religions, especially anything remotely conservative, teaches taht womene tempt men and we have the responsibility to not tempt them. So they are too weak to stop themsevles because they have urges. 

I grew up in the Midwest in a conservative Catholic family. For the record my 23 year old son was not raised like this and my 19 year old daughter would probably punch anyone who tried to imply this to her. If she didn't punch them she would scathingly roast their asses and do it loudly. Shes extremely funny and totally willing to publicly shame someone who tries to pull this crap.

So it is possible to not teach this stuff but its a LOT of work and I have had a LOT of therapy to undo my own assumptions about the truth of these statements. My abuse was primarily domestic violence but sexual assault is an unspoken thing that happens in probably 95% of these ""relationships"". 

My thinking shifted exponentially when I stopped seeing these interactions as relationships and started seeing them for what they were, someone trapping another into interactions with them that they were afraid to stop, couldn't say no to or were punished until they shut down and were unable to remove themselves from. It helped me a ton to realize that abusive people trap their victims. Its not a relationship."

There is a step before dominance in my opinion and I say this from experience. We just don't see simple assertiveness very often. My son has this down to a science. I do not.

Look. Anyone threatening to take your kid if you leave is abusive. Period. A significant other threatening to take your child qualifies as domestic violence. 

If someone is GENUINELY worried about their child's safety then they would make legal decisions to remove you from that child's life and, at the VERY LEAST, be living with that child to protect them. 

I have full custody of my youngest daughter because her dad is physically abusive. I made sure she had different babysitters, staying with my parents etc. 

I made PREEMPTIVE moves to keep her safe. That is how you handle a parent who is dangerous to a child.

What this guy is doing is abusive.

Please PLEASE stop talking to him about your PTSD. Don't give him ammunition because the court system does suck and good parents lose their kids to the parent who is willing to play dirty all the time. 

Get in touch with a domestic violence organization. You need a safety plan and the support and resources to protect yourself from this guy.

Threatening you to take your kid is domestic violence and I would not underestimate his ability to lie to control you but again, if you can get with a domestic violence organization you can get some help to navigate the system and leave as safely as possible."

Personally it came down to realizing that I was in the same place either way but at least going NC meant I didn't have to deal with the fallout from utilizing any of that supposed support.

niceguys,fbm2p0b,t1_fbkayi9,1576976766.0,">the feeling of not understanding women>

I'm not sure how old you are, my son is 23 and I am 42 so I was really young when I had him. Now that hes an adult we have had a lot of conversations about this subject because I would love to understand why he turned out the way he did. One of the primary things he has told me is that women are people. He views the women in his life with the same level of individuality as he does men. 

And I will say that this is something I worked hard to instill in him and so did his dad.

Having said that, he is also very in-tune to how abuse works and how the power dynamic in society is skewed. He is definitely a feminist and not to call himself one but because he views it as something that is obvious. 

A primary personal focus for him is how power dynamics work and the fact that women are considered this mass thing to understand is a component of that shift. 

In other words, you dont hear men trying to figure out how men as a whole work. You see men approaching each man as an individual.

Even the dudes who believe in the whole Alpha thing, will still treat a man as an individual when they are in front of them. 

Once you see how women are relegated to all being the same, then the power dynamic part makes more sense. Why should you give respect to a ""woman"" when women aren't actually individuals?"
StLouis,fbm1q6y,t1_fblh8yz,1576975998.0,St Louis County **only** takes a report if they are going to issue charges. So unless they decide to charge him at the time there wont be a record of anything other than the call being made. There wont be details of what the call was about. This is something that I would love to see changed as a domestic violence victim. Places like Arnold take a report no matter what. St. Louis County does not.

domesticviolence,f7zatli,t3_dy6gdr,1574107969.0,I wholeheartedly disagree with the addiction theory to abuse. It's all PTSD and conditioning and lots and lots of fear. The bottom line is that we all know instinctively on some reptilian level that leaving gets you killed. Our brains talk us out of it. The abuse conditioning talks us out of it and in order to survive we use the fawn response. It's still not love. It's also not addiction. It's the very nature of being terrorized into staying to stay alive or because we are are afraid of our abusers killing someone who helps us. My advice is to call your local domestic violence organization. Start working with them on a safety plan and hopefully therapy. The safety plan is vital and you need a domestic violence organization to help you do it properly. They can help you as you go along to get resources and get a protection order filed when it's time. The isolation and fear of what they are going to do is paralyzing and while the safety plan isn't definite safety it's better than going it alone. I'm so sorry for what you have lived through. Leaving is sooo fucking hard but it's worth it in the end. Don't try to wing it. Get help from a domestic violence organization in your area.

I'm 42 and while my kids are in college I did not finish or come anywhere close. The dedication that it takes to have ADHD and get through school blow's my mind. The fact that you are in school and giving tips on how you get it done is incredibly invaluable. Especially to someone like me who is just continually blown away by people who accomplish it. It's really really helpful to know HOW you are doing it. Because clearly your system is working better than mine. LOL

Find someone you can talk to because at some point you are going to have it be too much and you won't see it coming. There is something called secondary trauma and when it hits, it hits. 

You are a good dude. As a survivor myself, having someone believe you is amazing, having someone empathize like you are is a rare find.

sociopath,f6x3pgo,t1_f6x2hc6,1573241235.0,"Again. What tasks will the dog be trained to do that mitigates the symptoms of the disability?

These have to be specific and people get to ask what they are if you want to go into a public place. 

Again I don't know what the help would be. If you are lying and manipulative and abusive or any combination of those things you aren't going to be able to consistently treat your dog fairly enough that the dog is going to be able to work for you. 

I feel like I put more work into my relationship with my dog than my kids sometimes. I think the fact that I can't seem to explain the symbiotic nature of the relationship as opposed to the hierarchy you talked about in your original post, kind of illustrates the barrier here. 

I am not in charge of my dog and how she thinks and handles me. 

If I try to make our relationship like that then I'm not allowing her to influence me and my actions and emotions enough to have her trained tasks work.

Again they need to be able to do things that mitigate symptoms AND YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO BE INFLUENCED and that is the biggest barrier I see to this. 

Also ASPD isn't a disability and that is part of the criteria to call it a service dog. And people will ask. They're not allowed to but they will. They will risk being sued and deny you services if you don't tell them your diagnosis. These things are part of the day to day reality of navigating having a service dog."

sociopath,f6wxd8b,t3_dtcxy8,1573237038.0,"Service Dog's have to be trained to do tasks to mitigate the symptoms of a disability. ASPD isn't considered a disability, correct? 

Also I don't think you understand the day to day stuff that goes into a Service Dog. People talk to you CONSTANTLY it's insanely annoying. Also service dogs aren't just obedience trained. I hate to say it but your view of them is really unrealistic. 

Service dogs have to be able to think for themselves and sometimes they decide to pick up jobs they weren't trained to do but decide you need. Mine will alert that she needs to go relieve herself when she sees me getting stressed to get me out of the situation. Creative and definitely not trained. Also kind of annoying when I'm not always able to leave the second she wants me to but part of her job is to attempt to prevent panic attacks and dissociating. 

Having said that these dogs need down time so they can keep working and my relationship with my service dog is soooo much more labor intensive than my relationship with my dog that is a pet. 

Last point. EVERYONE fucking talks to you. People give you shit about going into stores. People touch your dog and then get pissed at you for telling them no. People are so much more up in your shit with a dog with you. 

I can not express enough how much more I have to deal with people when I have her with me. 

I mean honestly this is a fucking stupid idea because of the empathy issues with ASPD. I have to be super intune with my dog all the time. People think it's cool to have their dog with them but this is a mutual working relationship. She doesn't exist to just do my bidding. My pet dog however will do that stuff."

If you talk to the university they can help you stay safe by not allowing him on campus. I really don't want to scare you but one thing that happens out of these ""relationships"" is that we lose focus of the fact that this person wants us dead and that they frequently do make that happen.

Leaving is the most dangerous time. I really encourage you to reach out to an outside domestic violence organization BEFORE your college and create a safety plan. 

The Protection order doesn't ruin his life. It establishes that he is the abusive one and frankly, you need that, because these guys are notorious for hurting themselves and flipping the script and blaming you and then the victim is looking at legal charges.

Please reach out to a domestic violence organization in your area. Therapy there is free and so are their services to help you file the protection order. An advocate might even be able to help you get him banned from the college campus. 

You are in a very dangerous place right now. Please safety plan so you can leave and stay alive. 

You are welcome to reach out to me with your location if you want help finding organizations in your area. 

I have been there. I am still in hiding from my abuser. Please get help on how to a safety plan together."

CPTSD,f6oes8a,t1_f6nvsem,1573015407.0,"Just to give yourself a little more slack, the whole thing with dissociation is so that you DON'T recognize whats going on around you. The whole point is to lose focus on everything. So not recognizing it is super, super normal and in my opinion probably the hardest part about PTSD to figure out so that you can begin to move forward. 

I think most people tend to really catch dissociation on their way out of it. If that makes sense. 

I did a lot of work learning grounding techniques and had my childhood PTSD under control and then my last abusive relationship hit and I would find myself losing multiple hours and this is with me having kids. I would find myself having picked them up, cooked dinner, handled a couple of meltdowns and not remembering any of it. 

It's taken me a long time to just realized that if the day starts like that then I need to just pack it in, keep everyone fed and alive and try to get some decent sleep. 

I know this is a huge barrier for most of us, but a good night sleep with REM sleep involved really, really resets your brain and helps it heal from whatever triggered you that day. 

It doesn't fix the whole thing but it can keep you from losing a few days or a week but that assumes you don't also have the insomnia part of PTSD. 

Good luck! This shit sucks. Even with a ton of therapy under my belt it sucks and it doesn't go away. It changes, gets more manageable, there is definitely light at the end of the tunnel but I am fairly certain there is no end game where it will be gone at some point. For me this particular realization was helpful, it let me stop feeling so useless and like I was failing. That might feel different for someone else and I could be completely wrong about it going away. 

I have an absolute lifetime of crap plus some fucked up stuff later in life, at 42 now, my goal is just trying to avoid any more fucked up situations to add to it."

ADHD,f60pjho,t1_f5zzh58,1572622985.0,This is awesome and what's hilarious to me about compartmentalization is that since I have ADHD organizing the boxes is a joke. LOL I had this conversation with my daughter recently because she hates the diagnosis and my oldest and I are pretty annoyed by it but ultimately appreciate it. I told her that I actually try not to do this very much because then I forget the box exists and I have emotions floating around from something that I can't see anymore because it's buried under a bunch of paperwork or it's in a box I didn't label correctly. LMFAO but that's just me and probably the product of years and years of therapy which is what she is doing to help with the emotional regulation issues. She's only 11 so I hope she comes around. She's pretty convinced that embracing the ADHD makes me an idiot but I'm trying to model to her that I'm a lot less angry than she is because I'm not trying to be something I'm not.

domesticviolence,f609etz,t3_dpyh4a,1572610603.0,I read a lot and did a lot of therapy. Lundy Bancroft has books and videos of him giving lectures on YouTube and I'll tell you that if you ever want a man or ANYONE to tell you that not only is the abuse not your fault but you shouldn't even be the conversation this is the dude to do it. He's convincing in a well researched and obviously very tired of the world's incorrect focus sort of way. He does amazing advocacy work and his website is PACKED with information. His book called Why does he do that can be downloaded for free and it's literally a manual on how this isn't your fault and your abuser made choices. Anytime I find myself slipping I read anything he has written and I remember that there are TONS of people fighting to change how domestic violence is viewed and prosecuted and that usually does the trick.

Since you guys are planning to have a baby, maybe set up an account for her to stash away some money so she has it? Someone on this sub mentioned doing that for their wife when she left her job to be a stay at home mom because she was so worried about things. He was trying to find ways to make her feel safer doing so even though I don't remember that being a concern she had that she voiced. I remember being super impressed by intuitive he was to how scary it can be/but you can't really admit to it without sounding like an asshole/ internal fear of giving up your income and being dependent on your spouse. 

I don't even know if this is something she is worried about at least consciously and she may not be at all.  

I had my first kid at 19 and my ex and I were both broke together so it wasn't a concern but I remember him talking about how he thought it would be a good idea for parents to have an account for the stay at home parent. So when I saw that post from the dad/husband a couple years ago, I reembered my conversation years ago with my ex and even then thinking how neat it was that this dad to be wasn't threatened or offended and that he saw a potential concern before mom did. 

Anyway, just a suggestion. You might have to do it quietly if she's already feeling like she isn't contributing enough.

relationships,f4u94xx,t3_dlpbrs,1571802524.0,"Definitely get a different psychiatrist. My kids have schizoaffective disorder and we have really great ones. I will say there is nothing wrong with suggesting medications that work for family members, especially close ones like your mom. My kids are on the same meds but different doses. It's kinda wild how the meds work within families. The shit about the trauma and being emotional REALLY pissed me off. I would consider filing a complaint about that but that's just me. On a side note, the way you describe your symptoms sounds like bi polar with psychosis but it also sounds like schizoaffective bi polar type. The cycling is relatively consistent but it's also pretty rare for people to discuss the psychosis so it's essentially a rare ish diagnosis but I sometimes think that's because unless you can catch on to the cycling it's hard to diagnose.

ptsd,f4jonsa,t3_dkrwi0,1571623383.0,"I have a Service Dog for PTSD and I will tell you that I am significantly more independent than I would have been without her. I lucked out and my son trained her and our older dog for fun after doing some volunteer work with a service dog trainer in high school. 4 years later and Shortly after I left my really scary abusive husband she decided that she was going to start working for me. She interrupts nightmares, controls space for me, luckily she's huge and is very aware of her size without actually acknowledging anyone. She checks rooms for me, alerts me to a panic attack and when I'm dissociating she can get me out of a situation. She's does a ton of jobs and she finds more as we work together. The one thing I didn't expect was her ability to read people. She's eerily accurate and I trust her read completely. Dealing with people asking and touching them is a HUGE pain in the ass but honestly the benefits outweigh the annoyance and the upside is that it's always been easier for me to protect someone else than myself so keeping people away from her kinda comes naturally. Highly recommend getting one. The hardest part is finding a dog who can do it. My girl is 10 and I'm training her replacement. I went through about 350 dogs before I settled on the new puppy. So far so good but there is always a chance she won't be able to actually be a service dog and will wash out. I'm pretty confident she's going to be fine but I'm prepared to make her a pet if she can't hack it. My two girls are spoiled rotten and very loved and they really enjoy working. It's hard to find a dog that is observant and aloof to other people but that's the issue with any of them. Good luck. I hope you find someone who can help you get one."
relationships,f4jmc07,t3_dkph6b,1571622156.0,This honestly sounds like PTSD to me. The majority of these incidents were when you were dependant on her and your husband was really sick. People can only handle so much before they have to triage what's needed to survive. If you hid this from him and she did it while everyone was healthy and independent then yes there is a HUGE problem. But unless I missed something then things have recently died down and gotten into a routine. There is some solid science to the fact that PTSD begins to pop out when you are safe. This whole situation is traumatic and it sounds like your family is awesome which means you have ZERO familiarity with this shit. Honestly I am generally really hard line about people keeping stuff from others but this is going to unleash all the hell and fear you lived through wondering if your husband would survive. It makes sense that you aren't talking about it. Seriously get some therapy. Show your husband this post and cut yourself some slack. You kept her off of him when he was the most vulnerable. I think what you might be missing is that you kept him safe from someone who was very very very dangerous to your husband's survival. This is not about a lack of love. It's incredibly likely he wouldn't have survived if you had allowed her to railroad you. Personally I wish I had you in my corner. You did great in a really fucked situation.
