I‚Äôm just so overwhelmed and my university‚Äôs disability office is helpful for accomodations but then you‚Äôre kind of left to your own devices after that. We have 5 psychiatrists, I can only see mine every 2 months or so. We also only have one wellness advisor for my entire faculty, and I don‚Äôt have a family doctor... walk-ins aren‚Äôt a possibility and clinics and emergency rooms here take up to 10 hours and are so strained and overwhelmed that all they can really do is refer you to a professional but that referall takes months to honor (Quebec, Canada btw). The only resource I have other than all of those is helplines but all they can really do is talk you out of anxiety attacks or emotional breakdowns. They can also refer you to counsellors but even that takes weeks and at this point I have one more month of school. I really don‚Äôt want to stop any classes either because if I do I won‚Äôt be able to do my internship and that‚Äôs one of the only things I‚Äôve had to look forward to lately üòû"

Yekaterina Petrovna Zamolodchikova
But your dad just calls me Katya
I'm the bright red scare with the long blonde hair
Always keep 'em coming back for more
You're a basic ass hoe and it's your time to go
So bitch, let me show you the door
'Cause it's me whose getting laid and I'm always getting paid
The only high class Russian whore
I'm a scorching hot mess in a skin tight dress
That's a rash, not a herpes sore
Lenin in the streets, Dostoyevsky in the sheets
Baby, are you ready for this Cold War?

bipolar,fc2byyv,t3_efnxec,1577351178.0,"this is so deep I actually teared up... I‚Äôm type 2 and for the LONGEST time my parents would dismiss or question the validity/necessity of me taking my prescribed medication even after dozens of episodes, 2 hospitalizations, a night in a psych ward and being diagnosed by 3 different psychiatrists. They were so quick to hit me with the ‚Äúdo yoga‚Äù ‚Äúfix your sleep schedule‚Äù ‚Äúwater with lemon‚Äù ‚Äúveganism‚Äù ‚Äújournaling‚Äù ‚Äúgo hiking/jogging‚Äù ‚Äúwatch the sunrise‚Äù ‚Äútry this tea‚Äù ‚Äútry this natural remedy‚Äù and the MOST COMMON and aggravating suggestion was colouring mandalas. I must have like 7 or 8 colouring books full of mandalas they‚Äôve given me over the years that never really helped me. The truth is that it is literally impossible for someone, even a loved one, to fully relate to the realities of debilitating, invisible, mental illnesses without having one. And to be told all the time that the solution is x hobby/habit rather than receiving actual treatment is exhausting. Anyway OP, stay strong, and never stop colouring outside the lines in every sense. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
