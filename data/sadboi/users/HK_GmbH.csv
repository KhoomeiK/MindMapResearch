cats,foue6c8,t1_fopaj3h,1588082341.0,"That seems to be the consensus. I will not declaw the others then. I only considered it out of fear for the ones that had already been done. I've come to the conclusion declawing should be illegal and I was a complete moron for doing one of mine. I deeply wish I knew at the time what I know now.

As fucked up as it is what I did, I will do my best to make it up to my cats (especially the declawed) by giving them the best life I can and trying to educate others about how fucked up declawing is."

For the most part, they do not act aggressively towards my girlfriend's declawed tabby female cat. Really, the tabby female is the one who generally appears aggressive towards the others. Almost as if she is wise to the rules and etiquette of the cat world with regard to boundaries and space while my black male cats seem to generally and innocently have no concept of this."
cats,foud9pm,t1_fopaup1,1588081821.0,"The only reason I was considering it was due to half the cats in my household already being declawed. Kind of afraid that the clawed cats would hurt them due to having an advantage over them.

I think though after talking to you guys and observing the behavior of the cats, I've come to the conclusion that this is not necessary and will not be doing this.

My girlfriend's cat, I had nothing to do with its declawing. The one of mine that I did, I guess I can claim ignorance. If nothing else, I now know how fucked up declawing is. Hopefully they ban it soon and others won't do the same thing, thinking, like I did, that it was basically just nail removal."
cats,foucoz9,t1_fopdfle,1588081480.0,"I'm kind of thinking that is true as my girlfriend's declawed female tabby cat seems to be the most aggressive.

cats,fouccq9,t1_fopmp58,1588081278.0,"I would say after discussing this with cat people, I have come to the conclusion that this is not something that should be done with the other cats. That said, the reason I inquired about it was as half the cats in my house are declawed, I am slightly concerned about the clawed cats hurting them.

That said, I think my fears were probably not based in reality. Of all the cats in my house... the one that seems to be the most aggressive is my girlfriend's declawed tabby cat."

There is at least as many people who hold such ignorance about medication. Such people literally don't believe in mental illness (which to me is absolutely crazy).
