And above all else nothing political. I live in a country with government healthcare, it's great, my parents are jealous. I suggested they vote for it in USA, they said it would never work. Also anyone not a republican is an agent of Satan.

Our parents are fanatics, keep yourself safe."

Santa is just the spirit of Christmas. You can still participate in the magic without telling lies. My kids think bunnies live on the moon, they will figure it out eventually.

Cultivate a spirit of happiness, that is what makes the holidays. As you like."

Then that stupid chick tract"" this is your life"" I read it when I was 6 and from then on I would redidicate my life out of fear.  No wonder I have anxiety"

Three countries, 5 moves, it used to be an adventure for me, going to New countries, but now we have a child. I only have one friend nearby and she's leaving soon. Nothing bad has happened to me, I think the stress of life finally became unbearable when I created a life that is totally dependent on me. 

Thank you for your kind words strangers"

I don't want to die but I don't want to feel this pain anymore. My husband is out of country for work and I'm living with my mil. She's nice but she doesn't understand. No one understands, I'm so tired of being lonely and responsibilities. I can't even take care of myself, I don't want to hurt her"

Without reading the manga I would think less of this anime, it's good but the pacing is crazy. I remember being enthralled and disgusted by the team summer A saga.

But overall not bad, I'm looking forward to the next installment. I'm glad there are some other people interested in 7seeds."

So she acted differently then most of the upper chi alpha organization, we went to their conferences but they were normal toxic Evangelical affairs. 

I think I stayed a Christian for so long because of my leader and our chinalpha community.

Funny story, one student  who came regularly converted to Mormonism, we staged an intervention for her. Then gave her space, still hung out outside of group but of course we were always praying for her to leave her new cult. 6 months later she came back. I laugh now because I'm an atheist, I can't imagine what they would say to that."
