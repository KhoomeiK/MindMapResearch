OCD,fizpijm,t3_faokvh,1582869788.0,What kinds of obsessions does your character have?
ForeverAlone,figi4l9,t3_f7tje8,1582399755.0,"I’m 30, and while i do have a friend who will occasionally go to the movies with me, I honestly prefer going by myself. I especially like going to a showing with mostly empty seats.

Admittedly, you might not feel the same if you’re more extroverted than me."
WoT,fgh80bh,t3_eyhhfw,1580778834.0,Same!
imsorryjon,fgh7qq1,t3_eygpwy,1580778661.0,Kinda reminds me of the final boss from FInal Fantasy 6.
SuicideWatch,ffvt1tc,t3_evfj9k,1580272429.0,"All the time.

I don’t know what truly giving up would look like either, but sometimes I find myself thinking about “the next life.”"
Persona5,ffallx4,t1_ffaeprq,1579738814.0,You can play Personas 1-4 if you have a PS Vita.

WoT,fcmj7dz,t3_ehwsot,1577777463.0,"Interesting. I’ve only done shrooms, but I never considered reading while on psychedelics as I figured I wouldn’t be able to. (although my friend who loves WOT once felt like he was transported to the middle of a war in a fantasy setting while on LSD once). I kinda want to give this a try."
OCD,fc7c9rl,t3_egkags,1577503234.0,"I know what you mean. I could write an article about my experience with OCD (HOCD mainly), but I’m terrified readers will take it the wrong way.

I had enough difficulty finding someone in person who understood what I was going through. I don’t want to rile up a bunch of readers who might not be so understanding.

That said, now that people are beginning to open up about their mental health, this might be the best time to share our stories."
books,fc2dr54,t3_efroot,1577354270.0,"I took classes in high school and college that taught Maus, but neither taught the whole thing."
ForeverAlone,fbflcr4,t3_ed3q9k,1576813425.0,"I suffered from this too, but it honestly wasn’t so bad because my acne was only the second worst in my school—the high school quarterback had the worst acne."
confessions,fb5q0jd,t3_eb7vx6,1576532219.0,I never understood why we voted for things like that in school.
depression,f9pa2az,t3_e65utk,1575526792.0,"I hear ya. Although my performance reviews are usually good, I live every single work day expecting to be fired."
depression,f8wh4cg,t3_e2gnrw,1574890674.0,Yes.
depression,f72fz48,t3_dty0t5,1573361733.0,"I’m not sure if this qualifies, but every now and then I’ll text a certain friend who I never see anymore, and I feel like my real personality emerges when this happens."
SuicideWatch,f5uhgh4,t3_dp712x,1572473313.0,I know the feeling.

SuicideWatch,f39oxhb,t3_dg33nw,1570752825.0,"The technology kind of exists. It’s a pod instead of a booth, though."
OCD,f2u7zsd,t1_f2t1r7a,1570409718.0,I was struggling with existential OCD for a while without realizing it. I didn’t even tell my therapist for a long time because it never crossed my mind that it might be OCD.
thedavidpakmanshow,f22x8ql,t3_dbis5n,1569899307.0,"I’m not sure if David needs to try psychedelics, but at the same time, I kinda want him to hit Joe Rogan up for some DMT if/when he’s invited back to the show."

AdultDepression,f0pws7t,t3_d61lru,1568849319.0,"The short answer is exposure response prevention (ERP) therapy. For a longer answer, you’d have to consult a therapist."
SuicideWatch,eyp80sx,t3_cxxd53,1567292636.0,"I get what you’re saying with making sure suicide  is the last option, but we need more research on using psychedelics to treat our mental health. If you haven’t prepared your mind before a trip, you might just make things worse—and most of us in here are already thinking about suicide."
ProgressiveVoice,exumovl,t3_cspnn4,1566585671.0,I was kinda hoping Sahil would comment on this.
WingChun,exdhr7k,t3_cs6yk8,1566177001.0,"Slightly unrelated to your question, but if you use Meetup, you might be able to find a group of Wing Chun practitioners who get together and train."

WingChun,euy1m5q,t3_chuiwp,1564094405.0,"Just be straightforward with your teacher about your situation. You gotta do what you gotta do.

I’ve seen guys take time off where I practiced, and when they came back, my Sifu welcomed them back with open arms.

Who knows? You might even be able to work something out with yours."

depression,eq1defh,t3_bwuspm,1559706639.0,"Sometimes I have this fantasy, but I think that would make Suicide hell for me. I’d rather there just be nothing than to see how my death affects others."
ProgressiveVoice,eprb3de,t3_bvonx6,1559421457.0,Cody Johnston and Steven Crowder are apparently going to debate gun control. Hopefully PV covers that.
SuicideWatch,eofyw1a,t3_brpqms,1558546841.0,"Honestly, I think my fight/flight/freeze instincts would kick in (I’m not sure which one because, as far as I know, nobody has tried to kill me)."
