askwomenadvice,fqtpq5h,t3_gkp5zd,1589643683.0,The long labour stories aren‚Äôt as bad as they seem. I was in labour with my eldest for 36 hours but for the first 20 hours it was just like period cramp which got progressively worse. The next 6 hours were uncomfortable and I swore a bit and then I went to hospital and requested an epidural. They gave me gas and air while I had the epidural and also they put the epidural in whilst I was having a contraction so I didn‚Äôt really notice the needle going in. After that there was no pain and they let me keep the gas and air to keep me chill for the rest of the time. They cut me so I didn‚Äôt tear but due to the epidural I felt nothing. The next day though I felt it and took pain killers a lot for days until I finally listened to my mum and took a salt bath which made everything healthy up very quickly. I was induced with my second daughter and had no fear of the epidural due to the first time so asked for it before I had any pain and got a shock at how much it packed a punch. It only lasted a second but I wasn‚Äôt expecting it. I would recommend not getting the epidural until you have moderate pain. I didn‚Äôt tear or need to be cut the second time. Always take the gas and air though so you can stay calm even when you don‚Äôt need it for the pain. It‚Äôs not that bad and totally worth it.

I sleep with devices under my pillow. Somebody even posted a phone through the letterbox for her.

The boyfriends parents have said they won‚Äôt stop him from contacting her as he loves her and they believe he isn‚Äôt in the wrong and I am too strict.

She has started weekly therapy and also she has started an early help programme with social services where they teach them about healthy relationships and internet safety. At the moment she‚Äôs still nonchalant. I have found a new job 200 miles away and I‚Äôm looking for new schools.

She was in an all girls, catholic private school. This has only just started."

My daughter has caused so much trouble in the last month - underage drinking, underage sex, contacting birth dad who is now taking me to court, getting expelled from school and I even lost my job over it all because I took too much time off to deal with it all plus her step dad has lost thousands taking time off as he is a contractor and never once through all of it have I regretted never having her. I want to shout at her for ruining her life, for upsetting her step dad and her sister, I want to ask her what I did so wrong but never do I wish her unborn. Unfortunately I have had to look at messages between her and her boyfriend but I have told her I am doing it and I still have respected her privacy enough to not look at other private conversations and she doesn‚Äôt even pay for her own phone and she‚Äôs only 14!!"

They checked my stats and said I was well and booked me in for a scan the next day to save me waiting. Told me to come back if the bleeding got worse or I couldn‚Äôt cope with the pain. Still told me to drink tea and take paracetamol. Didn‚Äôt do me any harm. While I was there, a drug addict came in and said he took something unfamiliar and wasn‚Äôt feeling well. He was in for a right rollicking and was told to sit down and they would keep and eye on him in the waiting area while he worked it off. No waste of money tests over here.

insaneparents,f7tgaqp,t3_dxhv8p,1574004063.0,"I live in the north of England and my 14 year old daughter walks about 2 miles to school every day. She sometimes leaves earlier to walk in the opposite direction to get the bus. If she sleeps in then she calls an Uber. We live in the school catchment area. She‚Äôs been late for school before because she has slept in and called me to ask me to call the school to make up some bullshit excuse up so she doesn‚Äôt get detention and I‚Äôve refused.

Her lunch account is always topped up and she tends to not bother with breakfast until first break because she doesn‚Äôt wake up in time so she either takes breakfast bars from home or eats at school. It‚Äôs like ¬£2 three times a week.

Teenagers are dicks. Sometimes you just got to take the rough with the smooth and so do they.

Keep them fed but walking to school in the snow won‚Äôt harm them - buy them some wellies."

BlackPeopleTwitter,f7e0pjl,t3_dvkm8f,1573640466.0,"In the UK you get lots of different types of leave. Holiday, sick, compassionate, maternity, paternity. You don‚Äôt accrue it though. 30 days holiday leave ish is average. Sick pay tends to be unlimited unless you have a crap job where you need to claim statutory sick pay after 6 months. Compassionate leave is when you aren‚Äôt sick but if your kids or family are or if you go to a funeral or like a miscarriage. Maternity varies. My first time I got 6 months full pay but my 2nd I got a full year full pay and my holidays kept accruing so I used another month of holiday time. Paternity tends to be 2-4 weeks depending on company but the couple can split the maternity time. There is also parental leave which means you can take as much time as you need unpaid until your child is 5. Actually there‚Äôs adoption leave too which is normally the same as maternity.

We aren‚Äôt allowed to bring dogs to the office though üôÑ"

I write it addressed to my best friend so it‚Äôs casual but I write dates and times of when I pick my pen up.

It has helped track my movements a few times - problem lady has tried to say I was working from home when I shouldn‚Äôt have been - checked my notes and not only was I on a training course but I had seen her that day so she had lied probing my point that she is either incompetent or specifically lies about me.

This method would work for sexual harassment too. I track everything. Also write about the response you get when you do complain."
TrueOffMyChest,f3yt516,t3_diiqz5,1571259069.0,Hey!! As a project manager who has worked in a similar industry before I‚Äôve dealt with this. The few guys who disagreed with it mentioned it to me outside of work in the pub and I went directly to the bullied person and asked him about it. He confirmed what had been going on and I told him I wanted to speak to the men involved so I could make his life easier as I didn‚Äôt want behaviour like that on my project. He said he didn‚Äôt want any problems but didn‚Äôt mind me speaking to them if it would help the project by setting an example of how I wanted people to behave. I had those fuckers in my office within 5 minutes and made sure to tell them that if it came to it then I would keep the less skilled guy over them any day as he was one of my hardest workers. I wasn‚Äôt lying either. He started as a cleaner and 2 years later he left as a vehicle builder. They left that office and told everyone they were in trouble. Nobody knew how I found out but the bullying stopped and in the end the trouble makers had their own little whinging group and nobody spoke to them after a few months but the hard worker had plenty of friends.

jobs,f34o1qy,t3_dfif6k,1570657121.0,"Hey OP!!

I don‚Äôt know about the size of the company you applied for but I work for a huge corporate firm. We employ lots of people daily and I need to recruit 120 people for a project by the new year so I‚Äôve had to learn a bit about this area.

Follow this up to tell them you are still interested as if you got that far then they may be able to place you somewhere else. I‚Äôve had people come in to me who have not been given a job in another part of the company for many reasons - the manager didn‚Äôt think they would gel with the team as well as another candidate/ they were too expensive for the budget/ their security clearance would be a headache to transfer/ they had the know how but not the qualifications etc and I‚Äôve still given them a job. Lots of the time it‚Äôs the same job title in the same building but on a different team and project because I recruit across more areas so I get more of an oversight of the projects. Sometimes they end up on a higher grade and more pay. I once interviewed a guy who I thought was an idiot. I was on a panel with 2 men who also couldn‚Äôt believe what an idiot he was. He interviewed again a month later with a different department and they loved him and he‚Äôs hired as a grade above me in a different role - thankfully not managing anyone which is what I was interviewing him for haha

If you don‚Äôt try again then we can just put you as closed off on the system and assume you are no longer interested. I prefer it when I get people in who have already interviewed with someone else as normally I can speak to the previous interviewer who tells me their good points and it turns into more of a chat with the candidate then I‚Äôm more likely to make an offer."

I watch my friends the same age just having little ones now and they look tired and I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs not me but also I can‚Äôt judge them because it turned out fine for us and the way I did things - which probably wasn‚Äôt the easiest way.
