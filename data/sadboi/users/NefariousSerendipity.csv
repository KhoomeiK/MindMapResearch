math,fqz1x9v,t1_fqyybhm,1589758447.0,"Ahh so the repeating one. Also, why would one use ""infinite"" in this case if it's just a concept. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is if you can't put it on physical reality or paper then I'd label that number as not usable in the argument. 

And by that i mean not with the bar on top but 999999 etc. 

Hmmm 
I'd say .9999(repeating) < x < 1
X can be 1 - .0000000000 and whenever your 9 stops. Add 1 to thr last decimal digit. 

I can see it now. But again, why do we include infinity if it's a concept?"
math,fqyv75d,t1_fqydfp3,1589755116.0,"hiii i'm only in precalc. here's newbie question.

just as how limits are only ever very very very close approximations but NOT the absolute number.

can we all just say that .999 is very very very close to 1 but not entirely

becaues there are infinite points between two numbers and saying .999 is equal to 1 would be to deny that. 

please let me understand. thank!"
