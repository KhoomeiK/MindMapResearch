Obama won because he campaigned from the left and drew out people who dont typically vote. He inspired people who never vote to vote. That is how you win. You can't win over ""moderates"" because ""moderates"" are people who let cable news make decisions for them and those people will always vote party line no matter what. 

You literally just repeated the very thing I was arguing against. You're response will be just as repetitive. You are wrong and it has been proven in basically every presidential election. I'm from a hard trump area in a swing state. There are no republicans turned off enough from trump to vote for the vice president of a president who they hated for wearing a brown suit, asking for dijon mustard, and attempting to make their insurance premiums cheaper. 

I've watched people who were undecided in 2016 go from big bernie fans to hard core trump supporters because trump was the only viable anti-establishment candidate. By you repeating your narrative all you are doing is pushing other people out of the democratic party and into the republican party.

You're just like them if you believe a centrist will win you've swallowed the pill that cable news has screamed down your throat.
