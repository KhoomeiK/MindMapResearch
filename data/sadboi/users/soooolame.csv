We put too much pressure on young people to figure it out as soon as they hit 18. You’re a teenager still, your brain isn’t fully developed, and you have a ways to go before you really know yourself, and that’s ok. I wish I hadn’t gone to school at 19. Working and saving so I could invest early would have been great, and then had a clear idea later when My brain was settled about what I want to do. Turns out I don’t need school for my chosen career path now, just experience. Breathe easy, being 18 is hard and awkward.
