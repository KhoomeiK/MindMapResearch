vancouver,fq9virv,t3_ghivk9,1589207879.0,I remember my brother and I heard a huge metallic grinding sound once while we were watching TV. It was so weird and it happened at night in East Van. We went out on the porch and we could still hear it but it stopped after a bit. We joke about it now but I remember it felt so ominous lol. I wonder if it’s machinery echoing around the area or something.

I like low temps for flavour and light hits, but after I got my dynavap I learned that I prefer on-demand vapes with high temperatures. So now I mainly use high temperatures (392F+ on my Air 2) to get ripped. That way I don’t have to spend so much time vaping either."
