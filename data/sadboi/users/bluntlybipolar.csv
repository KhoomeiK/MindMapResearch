podcasting,fr4tqr2,t1_fr4oxtw,1589896695.0,"I'm of the mindset that it should be encouraged. A podcast is a creative effort. And not every creative effort can be or needs to be a masterpiece. Every painter, writer, sculptor, or musician has sucked before they ever got good. In the process of getting good, you end up creating some garbage. Even the people who are ""good"" can create garbage too, because it's impossible to produce a masterpiece 100% of the time. And even if you do manage to create a masterpiece, there will always be someone who thinks it sucks. ""You can be the ripest, juiciest peach on the tree - but some people just don't like peaches.""

An idea is not bad until you understand what the person is hoping to get out of their creation.

I'm a writer. I fell in love with writing the first time I read The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe when I was about 10 years old. In the process of growing and developing as a writer, I've written a lot of things that aren't for profit, aren't for artistic value, aren't for anything other than the fact that I wanted to write it as a means to keep those muscles healthy and active. 

Podcasting is no different than any other artistic endeavor. And what's wrong with those bad straight to VHS movies? Some of them are absolutely hilarious. There are people that genuinely love them because they are so bad they're good.

It's fair to be reasonable and realistic. If someone thinks they are going to get rich off of a ""my friends and I talk"" then yeah, I think it's fair to bring them back to reality. Just like it's fair to bring a writer who thinks they are going to get rich off of writing books back to reality. That's probably not going to happen.

But I don't think we should be worried about a ""joke medium."" Every medium is a joke if you look hard enough. Even high dollar blockbusters can be hot garbage. 

I feel it's okay to be critical without gatekeeping. An artist can't improve without constructive criticism. But I'd never discourage someone from creating anything. There's a lot of inspiration an artist can create for themselves while they're immersed in their work."
SuicideBereavement,fr1utr0,t3_gltuw2,1589826325.0,"I have problems with empathy too. I'm High-Functioning Autistic, which heavily impedes several social processes that neurotypical people possess. As a result, I've regularly been accused of not having empathy because I don't react ""normally"" to ugly things in life and loss. 

Have you ever met someone who doesn't experience empathy at all? Like, **at all?** It's an unnerving thing. They don't have the type of fears or considerations that I had or that you're expressing here. They simply don't care. It doesn't register on their radar of things they should care about. And the couple I've known and worked alongside of gave zero shits about how other people perceived them past the inconvenience it would cause them.

What your counselor suggested, alexithymia, doesn't mean you don't have empathy at all. You're just processing your emotions differently than other people. It sounds like you very well understand that there has been a terrible loss, that you miss your friend, that you understand that it hurt other people around you deeply. That's empathy.

If you want to reach out to his mother, you can do that. Share a positive or happy story about him with her. Try writing out your feelings or story first if you have a hard time verbally articulating them. A lot of people struggle with what to say in those kinds of situations. It doesn't make you less than or a bad person.

If your friend believed in you and felt you could be better than whatever it is you're doing, he probably knew you well enough to understand that your emotional landscape is a bit different. I don't think your friend would hold it against you because you weren't processing your emotions like other people do. 

Do the best you can. That's all you can do. And if you haven't been doing the best you can, that's okay too. You're human. You're allowed to falter. Just strive to make better decisions today and tomorrow and take solace in the fact that you're trying. Trying puts you away ahead of a lot of people."

And they feel like the mental illness itself is the punishment.

That has nothing to do with philosophy and morals. It's something that's unavoidable because unwellness can rewrite what a person finds acceptable and unacceptable. Combine that with the impulsiveness of escalation and you have a wonderful recipe to stomp all over everything you believe in a severe enough unwell cycle. If you've never experienced that loss of control, I hope you don't. It's an ugly feeling when the realization of how fragile it all is sets in."
BipolarReddit,fqzcwgm,t1_fqz82cg,1589764727.0,"It never really occurred to me that something was seriously wrong with me. I think the big problem for me was that I had no context. A lot of my unwellness and the chaos I experienced I internalized. I ended up rationalizing it away. I thought it was a lack of maturity or discipline that was causing my issues. In addition to have Bipolar Disorder, I'm also diagnosed with High-Functioning Autism. And part of being autistic for me is that it really messed with my conceptualization of other people and emotions. I think that greatly impeded my ability to understand that something was seriously wrong. I really didn't understand that I was different from other people because my brain just doesn't naturally do the things that would cause me to realize it.

I went through a period of mourning what my life could have been like had I not been mentally ill after I was diagnosed. For me, it got better when I realized that those years weren't lost at all. They gave me valuable context and experience that many other people either don't have or don't necessarily survive. After I got more stable and balanced, I started participating more in support groups and trying to help other people find their way. Mental health professionals are great for clinical knowledge and expertise, but they can be really hit or miss with the context of mental illness, which is where support and peer work comes in. 

I'm glad that you got help too, and that you're working on finding your way. Don't let those ""lost years"" get you too far down. There are a lot of mentally ill people doing all kinds of different things with their lives. You can do that too, even if it means you're on a different timeline than others."
BipolarReddit,fqz4bq5,t3_gloda9,1589759682.0,"Actually, you're not oversharing here. This kind of thing is what this sub-reddit is for.

I started Bipolar cycling when I was about 13 years old or so. I was in this weird space where sometimes I would be okay, sometimes I wouldn't be okay, and sometimes I'd be in-between. Like, there were times when my brain would be telling me that God was sending me messages in the newspaper and that the weather would dictate what kind of day I would have.

And sometimes that was the ABSOLUTE TRUTH. And other times, the rational part of my brain would kick in and be like, ""Hey. That's fucking crazy. God is not sending you messages in the newspaper. You are one of several billion people. The weather is not going to dictate what kind of day you're going to have. That isn't rational, reasonable, or sensical at all.""

That unwell cycle ultimated culminated in me putting a gun to my head when I was about fifteen and pulling the trigger on a dud round. Needless to say, it was not good times. 

Alas, I did an excellent job of hiding what was actually going on in my head too. Both my parents worked a lot and they didn't really see the kind of shit I was experiencing. There were definitely times where I should have been institutionalized, but I wasn't, because I was running with the kind of people that don't call 911 and don't talk to authorities. 

I wasn't diagnosed until I was 29 years old. I had a long, ugly mixed cycle where my brain tried to convince me that making a whole lot of other people feel just as fucking awful as I felt was not only a great idea, but the best idea I've ever had, the only thing I had left to do in life. I had dipped into psychosis. And if my ex hadn't said that the look on my face was scaring her and asked me what I was thinking about, there's a very good chance I'd be dead or in jail right now. 

Out of all of the ugly shit I've been through in my life, that was by far the worst. To feel like I had absolutely no control over my mind and thoughts, like something else was thinking inside of my head. I can definitely see why a person would think they were possessed if they experienced such a thing. 

I sought help the next day and was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. Which is also a good thing. I was going to kill myself that evening if they found nothing wrong with me. I was terrified I would lose control of my mind again and do something terrible."

Good isn't going to roll up to your front door, pound on it, and say, ""Here I am!"" That's just bullshit people write to sell books and speaking tours. 

It's been two months since your boyfriend completed suicide in front of you. Two short months. Two small steps in what's going to take a great deal of time and emotional energy to claw your way toward something better. It's going to take much longer than two months to work through something like that.

You can't rely on your friends, family, and loved ones to help you heal whatever wounds were left by his action, or whatever wounds you suffered before it happened. You may very well need professional grief counseling and getting involved in support groups where you can find meaningful understanding and the space to heal. 

But healing isn't a complete and total process. I like to think of it like getting into a car accident. You may walk away from that car accident with just a few bumps and bruises and be otherwise fine. You may also survive the accident but wake up in a hospital bed, barely able to move. The doctors can piece you back together, reset bones, help you on your healing. You may have to go to physical therapy to learn how to walk again. But hey, you were in a terrible accident. You may end up walking with a limp or experiencing some pain off and on for the rest of your life from those injuries.

That doesn't mean you can't work to create some peace and happiness otherwise. But you don't have to be happy right now. You don't have to want anyone else right now. You don't have to get over it right now. 

Best thing you can do is seek out a professional to help you find your way through this ugliness. Hopefully with more time, you can reclaim some peace of mind and want to be here more days than not.

And then just give your loved one some time to feel what they need to feel about the situation. If they were just diagnosed after this breakdown, this is an entirely new and scary situation for them that carries a lot of weight with it in the form of stigma and what if's. 

Remind them you love them, and try to avoid getting pulled into any arguments about the situation. Just fall back to the position of, ""Look, we were afraid for you and didn't know how to help you. So we got you help."" 

They may not see the truth or wisdom in that statement right now, but hopefully they will with time and more clarity."
BipolarReddit,fqtnmx6,t3_gkvnpy,1589642496.0,"I'd give you the following advice.

1. Understand that ""better"" doesn't necessarily mean ""happy."" I find a lot of people make that mistake. In my case, medication quieted the raging storm in my head and allowed me to create and build happiness for myself by providing stability. 

2. Make sure you take it AS DIRECTED. I've known several people who did not take their meds as directed and destabilized themselves.

3. Don't get discouraged if it doesn't work for you. Just because one medication didn't work doesn't mean others won't. Finding the right medication can be a long process. Some people get lucky and immediately hit on one that works for them. Others don't. The only way to know for sure is for you to take it as directed and see how it goes.

4. If it is safe for you to do, consider keeping a mood and personal journal. It will help you track your thoughts and moods as you advance further down the road. It's helpful to see where you are coming from and where you are going. It also gives you an opportunity to plan for the future.

5. Visit a therapist if you can. Make your first goal to understand how your mental illness *affects you specifically.* Wellness and recovery are very individual processes, even though we are all on similar roads. And Bipolar Disorder can look very different from person to person on the surface. You need to figure out you.
6. If you find that your thoughts and feelings are getting worse, contact your doctor immediately and let them know. Bad reactions happen. Intercepting them early is the key to keeping them from spinning out of control. 

It's okay to be scared. You're taking a big step into a new world, writing a new chapter of your life. But things can get much better."

Let me give you an example.

The knight rescues the damsel in distress. 

Liam Neeson rescuing his daughter and her friends in Taken.

Denzel Washington rescuing his client's daughter in Man on Fire.

I'm sure you can think of more yourself. At their core, it's the same story. What's different is the perspective and spin that the creators put on the story to personalize it. 

The biggest thing with self-help personalities and authors is that people need regularly pushing to get through their difficulties. There are a lot of people that waver in confidence, like you are now, for a bunch of bad or wrong reasons. Self-help perpetuates itself by being the people who are willing to be cheerleaders and push other people forward. It's not just about the content.

My suggestion to you is just publish it. It's not really possible to know what's going to resonate and what won't. You can spend a month working on a thing that you think is magnificent and it can bomb. And then you can bang out an article in like 3 hours that everyone loves.

It may be worth asking about to get screened. Autism is a spectrum disorder that can look very different from person to person. When I mention I'm HFA (High-Functioning Autistic), people that don't know me tend to be surprised because none of it really shows on the surface. My empathy is impaired, I have a hard time connecting with people, I have a difficult time with intangibles and things that don't seem logical, and my brain just doesn't do several of the social processes it's supposed to; like with naturally interpreting and reacting to body language and social cues. There was one time an ex of mine was having a kind of mental breakdown, curled up in the corner of the bedroom in the fetal position, and was apparently crying to herself. When I saw her, all my brain said was, ""That's a weird place to take a nap."" And it never occurred to me that hey, maybe something's wrong! It's not that I didn't care, didn't love her, didn't support her...it's just my brain doesn't do some stuff. Same deal with sex. Many neurotypical people do it to feel close and intimate with their partner. I can't comprehend that. I don't really feel close or intimate to anyone that I've ever loved. There are emotions there, but they appear to be much more shallow than what neurotypical people experience. I value the people I love and care about and make active choices to demonstrate that love. It's nothing I just have.

But yeah, none of that stuff you really see on the surface, other than my looking like an insensitive asshole from time to time.

>For me, I was perfectly comfortable with it, I felt I could be there for him in a way no one else could be.

Funnily enough, this has helped me build bridges a lot in my mental health work. I never pity anyone, and wouldn't want to if I could. In fact, I've been able to break through with other people like me because I could look them in the eye and tell them I didn't feel sorry for them. I'm there to help them help themselves. Some people need that. I think pitying anyone is depriving them of agency and undermining whatever personal strength they are still clinging to. A troubled person is not some lost puppy to be pitied.

But yeah, I've been in similar situations as you were with your uncle. The fact that you felt compelled to do something and be there for him really speaks against the idea of sociopathy. A sociopath would be indifferent altogether.

>I should perhaps disclaim the asshollery factor more. I’ve gotten so good at acting “normal” most of the time, it’s really confusing for people when that breaks down for whatever reason.

Yeah. It's like that for me too. I read a bunch of books on body language to get a better idea of how to interpret social cues and practiced a lot. I also learned from what more sociable people did too. And yeah, it's usually jarring when something doesn't come off right. Another thing I've noticed is that people really don't like it when you pay too much attention. Like, one time I recalled some random detail someone had told me months before, and it really made them uncomfortable. They stopped talking to me because of it. It wasn't even anything consequential. Just some minor tidbit of information that they said in passing that stuck.

>I will try to make myself look vulnerable first so he doesn’t interpret it as some sort of power play.

Don't do that. Don't try to make yourself look vulnerable and come from a position of weakness. If you told him you have sociopathy traits, he is more likely to believe that you're trying to pull a power play to manipulate him than you are trying to fix the situation. Just approach the situation straight on, as an equal, and let him decide for himself how to interpret it and respond for himself. 

>I’m on the edge of hopelessness, because I feel misunderstood, by everyone. Even my family who I value so much because of their commitment to me, I have to be on my toes constantly, making sure I don’t say something which hurts them.

I feel you there. I love my family dearly, but I've learned to just keep my mouth shut a lot of times. Like when my grandma died and everyone was so broken up over it. I loved my grandmother dearly. But she was like 90 with only 13% kidney function. What did they think was going to happen when she went into the nursing home? And I know that makes me sound like an asshole. It doesn't matter that I was at her house doing chores for her all the time, keeping her company, helping her with her dialysis machine, getting her groceries, choosing actions that regularly demonstrated my love even though I didn't cry or mourn her death really. 

And that's because emotions aren't logical. People just need to feel what they feel and I need to not impose my reality on them. 

>Yet I can’t help but to live anyway. Talking to someone about my inner thoughts like I did with the pdoc throws me into a frenzy.

Dude, me too. I went to talk therapy for three years. I hated every fucking session of it. HATED it. I never wanted to talk about shit. I've never experienced any kind of catharsis from talking about anything. But, what I needed to do was understand how my brain functioned differently through the autism and bipolar disorder to the rest of the world. So I went in anyway, ripped open the ugliest parts of myself, and used it as a means to better control my mental illness and find my way in the world. 

I'm not trying to kick you off your little piece of hope, but personally, I've come to accept that I cannot connect with people like a neurotypical person would. And I've become okay with that by understanding that there are places for me in the world. There are a lot of jobs, a lot of roles, a lot of things out there that require people who can stay detached. I have to couple that with an external moral compass though, because mine just kind of spins because I don't always fully comprehend how an action of mine will affect someone else. Learning to keep my mouth shut when other people get emotional so they can feel what they need to feel was probably the biggest improvement overall though.

We're not lesser people. We're just different. Don't mourn things you can't have. Instead, focus on what you do and can have, and go hard on that angle. 

Your family may have thought you were an asshole while dealing with your uncle, but did your uncle? What kind of man was he? Was he someone that would have wanted to be pitied or feel like a burden to his loved ones? Probably not. Most people don't. And that was something you were able to give him that other people couldn't, because you are who you are. And you are just as valuable as anyone else."
BipolarReddit,fqpb44j,t1_fqp8q25,1589541295.0,"Out of curiosity, have you ever been screened for autism? I remember when I was really working on trying to empathize and relate to people, reading about telling the difference between sociopathy and autism. And it boiled down to something like, ""People with autism desire connection, but have a hard time creating it. Sociopaths don't have a natural desire for connection.""

Because in your post, it really sounds like you're trying to bridge that gap, to be understood, to not be judged. 

But yeah, I definitely feel you on the empathy regulation front. It has caused a lot of pain and difficulty in my life...it's also served some good purposes as well. There are a lot of situations in life where too much empathy is a bad thing. Like, I did a lot of volunteer and some part-time work in mental health since I was diagnosed. You end up watching a lot of suffering, which didn't bother me nearly as much as my neurotypical counterparts. 

I try to lean into the strengths of it. And I usually inform the people I'm close to that, ""Hey, if I'm acting like an asshole, I probably don't realize it. Tell me."" That's worked out pretty well overall. 

Next appointment you have with your doc, just own it. Go in and be like, ""Hey. I want to apologize if I made you uncomfortable in our last appointment. I was just trying to get you up to speed and may have overshared a bit too early."" Hell, you may find that it didn't have anything to do with you at all. Maybe they were just having an off-day or something.

BipolarReddit,fqp8axp,t3_gk6by8,1589538601.0,"I know the judgment sucks, but unfortunately, that's just how it is. It's worth keeping in mind that mental health professionals deal with a lot of unstable and unpredictable people regularly. If you're telling them that you have sociopathic traits and have some history that demonstrates that, then people who don't know you or know how much work you've put in to be a productive member of a society aren't going to be able to see that work until they get to know you. Don't drop the heavy shit or ugly details on them immediately.

One of my earlier therapists suggested I had sociopathic traits. Turns out I actually had High-Functioning Autism. I don't emotionally empathize well with people, which has also created some pretty ugly moments in my history. 

I find the best way to handle it is to avoid ugly details and only really disclose those parts of my history if I need to work something out, and only after I've built a relationship with the professional. 

You may or may not be paranoid about it. It might have made him uncomfortable. 

I hate to say it, but you're going to be judged. That's just how people are. Take pride in your own efforts and avoid looking to others for validation is what I did. I didn't ask for the life I led, so I don't concern myself too much with the opinions of people that want to judge me for it."

BipolarReddit,fqp5xrc,t3_gk5i57,1589536193.0,"That certainly sounds like you could be escalated. Your current experience pretty much describes what an escalated unwell cycle could look like. Little sleep with too much energy, amplified sociability, racing thoughts, and having spiritual epiphanies. 

Your therapist will probably refer you to a psych if they aren't one themselves. 

In regard to your boyfriend, how seriously does he take mental health? Can you count on him for meaningful support?

The best thing you can do when you're escalated is to avoid feeding the beast or making any major life decisions until you can deal with it however you're going to deal with it. Avoid stresses as much as you can, cut back on any caffeine or uppers, and do your best to not let yourself get swept into those thought loops. I like doing things like sudoku puzzles because they force me to think about the puzzle to figure it out. Helps me break the constant thought loops. 

Don't let yourself get swept in by the good feelings of what you're experiencing. It's seductive, but it never lasts."
BipolarReddit,fqo32qj,t3_gjtvsk,1589506565.0,"I can't speak for everyone else, but I can tell you that I definitely did that too after I was initially diagnosed. And the reason was actually pretty simple, I didn't understand what normal, healthy emotions felt like. I'm a Type 2 as well. I spent 15 years undiagnosed, spending most of that time in mild to suicidal depression. 

After I was diagnosed, started going to therapy, and started medicating, I found that I would think about it ALL THE TIME, because I was trying to figure things out. But once I started to figure things out and get more comfortable with the developing knowledge of myself, I was able to pull that back and taper it down. 

Nowadays, I generally give it about 5 minutes of thought in the morning and that's about it, unless I run into something triggering or intense. One of the big tells that I'm getting unwell is that my sleep is starting to get disrupted, so it's a good metric for me to intercept unwell cycles before they have a chance to get rolling.

But yeah, I definitely feel you on the incorrect perception about Bipolar Disorder. It's way more complicated than how I originally perceived it. And why wouldn't it be? It's a complicated mental illness and I had never taken any real time to know anything about it before I was diagnosed.

Silly me."
BipolarReddit,fqo2f3d,t3_gjxler,1589506186.0,"""On the spectrum"" of Bipolar Disorder is just a fancy way of saying you have Bipolar Disorder. Bipolar Disorder is itself on a spectrum. Don't get too hung up on the verbiage. Ask your doctor for greater clarity, if they are identifying you with a type or if they see it as NOS. As you well know, getting to the truth of things can be a difficult, time consuming process.

Learning how to navigate genuine emotions not stained by mental illness isn't so much difficult as it is a long-term project. I'm a Type 2. I spent 15 years undiagnosed, spent most of that time in mild to suicidal depression with the attempts to show for it. I would cycle between the black hole that is depression up into paranoid rage and hostility. There were very few times that I was okay before medication and therapy.

The best point of perspective I can give you is that healthy emotions are much more quiet than the ones amplified by Bipolar Disorder. The chaos became much quieter, which was a thing that I had to learn to accept and live with as well. Happiness, sadness, all of the healthy emotions in-between; they are all very quiet compared to what I experienced while I was unwell and unstable.

This is something you'll want to work on interpreting and understanding with your therapist. One thing that helped me a lot was looking at the way my sane, rational friends emotionally reacted to things. There is commonly given advice to ""not compare your emotions to other people because your emotions are valid."" Which is sort of true? It was true that I was experiencing those emotions, but they weren't valid to me because they were a product of mental illness, not rational responses. I would think about how people I had known in my life would react to certain situations when I found myself experiencing intense emotions. It gave me a good metric to counter-balance against while I learned how to feel my own emotions.

That might help you if you have people in your life that are fairly rational and emotionally healthy. Not everyone is that fortunate though."

Your friends are right. It's not only a saturated market, it's one a lot of people are drowning in. Clicks have nothing to do with content quality and everything to do with marketing. You don't mention how you're marketing your content at all. 

Your descriptions and titles need work. First and foremost, none of your descriptions or titles actually tell me what any of the episodes are about. Are you discussing specific topics within the field of MarTech with these people? Is it general conversation? None of your descriptions or titles tell me anything useful about what I'm about to hear. You don't need to A/B test descriptions. That's a bit far. You need to have some kind of description period. 

You also need to understand that you're in a hyper-competitive space. It's not just about going up against other people in MarTech. You're vying for the ears and attention of people against all other forms of entertainment. Your podcast sounds like it's meant to be educational rather than entertainment though. None of your descriptions or titles communicate to me why I should listen to you or your guests. 

You're also limiting your scope and reach because there are no keywords for search functions to latch onto. People can't find you.

I wouldn't invest money into ads until you get your description copy fixed. I would also really consider what you want to accomplish and what channels you want to use to reach other people with your content. I feel like it would be a much better idea to push this project out in your professional circles and with your guests. Get them to share it with their circles. Share it within your own circles.

If you can develop a quality show that professionals in your network want to listen to, some will share it with other professionals in their networks. If you find that you can do that, THEN spend money on advertising. And I wouldn't use Google Ads. There are different podcatchers that sell ad and promotion space. I would use them instead."
podcasting,fqeh7uc,t1_fqe71tm,1589307506.0,"I'm a digital marketer that's worked in the wellness space for awhile. Let me give you some perspective. 

There are a lot of frauds and bullshitters in the wellness space. It's one of those gray areas where less than ethical people can ply their trade. But here's the thing. If you have something of genuine, ethical quality, then you will have a powerful tool of leverage over the people who aren't acting ethically and your skeptics. All you have to do is represent yourself and what you do honestly, and remind yourself that you are representing yourself honestly when those negative feelings start creeping in.

Your topics may be in-depth and esoteric, but you don't have to present the material that way if your target audience is a leisurely crowd. You can make that information more digestible by understanding why your audience is tuning in to your work in the first place. Stress relief? Religious purposes? Exercise? Once you understand that, you can refine your message to be relevant to that group of people. 

It may very well go over peoples' heads or alienate people, and that's okay. Good marketing accomplishes two goals. The first is that it attracts people who are interested in your product. The second is that it tells people who wouldn't be interested in buying that it's not for them. The more refined you can target your message, the better you'll land with the small group of people that are buying. 

Let me give you a practical example. If I'm selling a Mercedes-Benz, do I care at all what people who can't afford a Benz think of my advertising or message? No. No, I don't. They aren't buying. Their opinion is entirely irrelevant in making my marketing and advertising successful. I'm selling a luxury car, so I'm interested in appealing to what people who can afford and want this elegant piece of German engineering. Maybe they love the engineering. Maybe they love the brand. Maybe they want it as a status symbol. 

In content marketing, you don't have to make your content infinite either. You could make an informative podcast series that could serve as a lead magnet in podcatchers and with Search Engine Optimization for the search engines. If you created like a 12 episode podcast series, you'd then have that out there working for you. And you wouldn't need to worry about running out of content either. It's also an excellent way to clearly demonstrate that you know what you're talking about. And then you can use that as a hook to find more customers for your digital wellness retreats."

All that we have to make any kind of assertion on is this limited paragraph of text. We don't know what kind of people they are, what your dynamic is with them, what baggage you are carrying, what baggage they are carrying, or anything really. Just this little blurb.

""Understanding"" is a complicated word in mental health. We have a hard enough time finding understanding from trained professionals, is it reasonable to expect it from average people? I don't think so. Most people don't understand because they can't understand. It's like asking a man what it feels like to give birth to a child. He can earn a degree, read books, watch talks, deliver a thousand babies...but very few people are going to take his word for understanding what it feels like to give birth to a child. He just doesn't have the context like a mother does.

Your family may love you. They may also have the emotional intelligence of a brick. Not everyone is good with emotions. A lot of people don't have massive support networks. Sometimes it's just one friend or family member. Sometimes it's no one. Sometimes it's support groups like this one. And some people get lucky and have many of those things.

If your family sucks at support, but generally acts with love otherwise, you'd be better off looking elsewhere for support and accepting that for what it is. 

As someone that's lived openly with my mental illness for about a decade, I have to say that ignorance is what I've grown to expect. My family doesn't understand either, and honestly, I hope they never do, because I think the only way other people can truly understand it is by sitting in those same dark places. 

The other factor is that some people just don't have a thick enough skin to offer meaningful support. It touches on too many of their own unresolved pains or traumas. I've met quite a few mentally ill people like that over the years, people who want to help or be involved but they just can't, because it disturbs their stability to watch other people suffer.

As a man, not being able to pull my weight and support my son, or have a good relationship with his mother, was something that helped pushed me toward the edge, along with the other problems I live with. It's socially ingrained in us that if aren't able to provide and support, then what good are we? But we are more than just our ability to provide.

What I do know is that being dead definitely wouldn't have helped the situation at all.

I don't know your friend's situation. If he's just having a hard time with employment right now, if he became disabled or what. It's a rough world for a lot of people right now, but it won't be like this forever. Something will hopefully break loose.

I spent 15 years undiagnosed with Bipolar Disorder with plenty of the physical and emotional scars to show for it. So when presented with this new reality, that the life I had been living wasn't accurate, well that was frightening and overwhelming. So, let me address your points in this post and we'll get you pointed in the right direction so you can start off writing this new chapter of your life strong.

>*My original intent for this post was to ask if you guys know of resources to learn about Bipolar. I've been seeing things like BP I and BP II...

[This is a really good introductory article](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/bipolar-disorder/bipolar-disorder-signs-and-symptoms.htm) on Bipolar Disorder. That will provide a lot of foundation for you. Beyond that, I would encourage you to read as much as possible about the disorder while providing due scrutiny to the source. The thing with Bipolar Disorder is that even though we are bound by similar symptoms that flow beneath the surface, that can look VERY different on the surface from person to person. So professional information like that is often written in a very generic way so that it is generally informative to whoever reads it. But when you get into things like personal experiences and accounts, then you start seeing the vast differences from person to person. Avoid the mistake of thinking there is a right or wrong way of experiencing your mental illness. 

I had a huge problem with this when I was first diagnosed because I experience Bipolar Disorder in a way that people don't really write articles and books about. I would cycle between numb, hopeless apathy and paranoid anger and hostility. Both made it very hard to function in any capacity for long stretches of time.

>Ok, when I say ""just"" I mean a few months ago, but I'm still trying to wrap my head around everything...

It is scary, and that's okay. The way you experience symptoms will change as you work to find the right medication. That's the point of the medication, to bring those symptoms under control. What's very important is to keep an eye out for anything that might be getting worse or more intense. If that happens, contact your doctor immediately and let them know. Bad reactions on medications happen. Intercepting them early can help you avoid any bad decisions or long-term repercussions. 

And yeah, I think we've all felt insane a time or two. But you're not. You're mentally ill and going through a difficult time. That doesn't make you less of a person. Everyone has their problems. Ours just happen to be in the mental illness side of things. You're not a freak, I promise you there are plenty of other people who have experienced similar things that you have. I sincerely doubt that you're faking it to get attention or that it isn't real. I've known other people who have struggled with those kinds of thoughts while they were working to accept their diagnosis. 

Do you have a therapist? Can you see one if not? It would be very helpful if you can, to help you navigate through acceptance and learn more about how your mental illness affects you.

>I live with my SO. There's days, sometimes weeks, where I can't function and don't even take care of myself...

You're not putting your SO through this. Your SO is standing beside you through a difficult stretch with a health problem. That is an active choice that he is making. Love is not about sunshine and roses. That shit is nice, but you can have a good time with anyone if you're not an asshole. Love is about who is willing to walk through the ugliness of life with you, and who you're willing to do that for too. It sounds like you have a good partner who is doing his best to help you. Just keep working to battle that paranoia and those bad feelings that you're having right now. You won't be like this forever. The best thing you can do for your boyfriend is to keep attending your appointments and keep working on getting balanced, stable, and well. Yes, there's a lot of things you can't do for yourself right now, and that's okay. You're working through a difficult stretch with your mental illness. It shouldn't always be like this.

>My grandmother was bipolar and poorly managed it. I grew up seeing how bad it can be, and it freaks me out. Am I like that? Do people see me the same way I saw her when I was a kid, like I'm totally crazy?

It is very important to not compare your journey with mental illness to anyone else's. Your grandmother grew up in a time when mental illness was not accepted and heavily stigmatized. It's hard telling how she would have turned out if she had meaningful support and the ability to get effective treatment. Or, she may not have, which can lead to some ugly outcomes. Either way, you are not your grandmother. You can make better choices.

There are people that have very negative opinions of people with mental illness. And not all of them are invalid. Since I was diagnosed ten years ago, I spent a good chunk of time running a Bipolar blog and doing various volunteer activities. In my experience, there is a slim margin of people who will get it and be understanding. The majority of people with no experience with Bipolar Disorder will underestimate it. But the people who react with anger and hostility, well, they're usually people who have lived in fear of people like your grandmother or have their own traumas that they attribute to a loved one's Bipolar Disorder. I got a lot of hate mail when I was running my blog and it hurt quite a bit until it finally dawned on me that a majority of those people weren't talking about me at all. They were talking about someone who did a lot of harm to them and basically had their on suffering undermined by people telling them that they needed to be more compassionate to the people that harmed them. 

Will some people look at you that way? Yes. They will. But that's not because you are a bad person or will turn into a bad person. It's because they're wounded people with their own unresolved issues. I find that looking at them that way helped me release my own anger and not get sucked into flinging shit with them.

>I'm afraid to tell my family about any of this.

It would probably be a good idea not to if it's something they will use against you. If you want to do it, wait until you're in a healthier mental space where clashing with them won't be as harmful to you. Some people aren't understanding and don't want to be. And unfortunately, sometimes you're related to those people. You don't have to show vulnerability and give them the ammunition to shoot you with. Keep it to your private circles. 

In the mental health space, there are a lot of lovely articles and super bright speakers who talk about how important it is to speak your truth and help combat stigma! Those people are mostly full of shit. Yes, it is important to be comfortable enough with yourself to be who you are. Yes, it is important to war against stigma. But what they tend to leave out of that bullshit are the very real repercussions that can result from doing that - like losing your job or career, being ostracized by friends and family, and having other people use it against you. 

If you don't feel safe being open and honest, then don't do it. If you just want to work on your recovery and live a quiet life of managing silently with your close network, then do that. There is nothing wrong with that. Always keep in mind that you're the one that will have to deal with the repercussions of openness with your struggles. It won't be those polished speakers that need to deal with the harm done while you're vulnerable.

>I just feel so alone and overwhelmed. I have friends and chosen family who love me and support me and will listen, but no one who understands.

That's normal. If you want to feel understood and less alone, you want to spend more time in this subreddit or look into support groups. Your friends and family aren't going to understand, unless they are also mentally ill. And even then it can be questionable. It's like asking a man what it feels like to give birth to a child. They don't have the context to understand. They can learn things and gather intellectual knowledge, but they aren't going to understand like a mother would. 

>I feel so fucking lost and am having the worst feelings about myself and my life right now so yeah... this is great...

It's normal to feel lost this early in the journey. The most important part of recovery is patience. It takes time to get your feet under you and start to feel okay. It took me almost three years before I could look around and say, ""Hey. I'm actually feeling okay now."" 

It may help you to take up journaling. That way you can look back on the progress you've made, develop short and long-term goals, and have physical proof of your effort and work to show yourself when the doubt and fear creeps in. 

It's going to take time and it can be much better. It may not be perfect, but it can be better. You just have to be patient, comply with treatment, and keep working to figure out how your mental illness affects you specifically so you can find the right ways to manage and live a better life."

If you don't want to spend your time doing web development type work, you may want to look at a website host like Squarespace which offers easy to put together websites that can support more than podcasts.

podcasting,fphfktz,t1_fpha7kb,1588620403.0,"Ah, I see. I would be curious as to how you came to that conclusion.

While I think that type of product would serve an admirable goal, I don't think it's a lack of effective tools that a lot of podcasters are missing. I think ti's podcasters not taking the time to understand how to use their tools effectively. You don't drive screws with a hammer.

I think podcasting is a lot like every other creative medium. A whole lot of people do it, and not many of those people ever make much money from doing it. Before I was a digital marketer, I was a writer, and that's just how it goes in creative endeavors. Many writers don't make money on a first book. Sometimes they don't make money on following books either. 

A lot of people don't make things that can catch on or that other people are willing to pay for. And then you have people that can who feel awkward or like they shouldn't charge for their art. 

I see people complain about engagement a lot, but what they don't seem to understand is that engagement versus consumption is rare on the internet. If you can hit 3% through a website or a landing page you're doing amazing in general. Furthermore, engagement really isn't as good of a thing as people think. 

I ran a niche blog for years and one of the biggest mistakes I made was listening too much to my audience's feedback. A lot of it was well-meaning, but after awhile, it pulled me away from the way I wrote and the way I explored the subject. When I finally pulled the plug, I was regularly getting ""What happened to your content? You used to be so good!"" emails. And what happened was I listened to the people who told me I was great, but I would be better if I just made this one little adjustment, because I want to make my audience happy, right? No. What I should have done was stuck to my original vision and continued to hone that into what I wanted to see put into the world, not what my audience wanted to see. 

Developing content and marketing content are two entirely different problems with different solutions. 

I also don't understand what you mean about not having ownership of their materials. It's no different than putting out content through a blog, social media, or building everything from scratch on AWS. Everyone uses a host in some way. 

Traffic and content aren't managed by hosting sites and distribution companies. They're just providing the storage and bandwidth for people to provide their content. That lack of reach isn't their fault, it's the fault of the podcasters who haven't taken the time to learn anything about SEO to understand that they have to do more work to improve their discoverability. 

A simple blog with a written transcript of their episodes would do wonders for discovery for a lot of people because Google can effectively index that and understand that the content provided is valuable for people searching for those relevant keywords. 

Every day there are people who are posting threads in these sub-reddits, asking how to get found and reach more people. Almost never do I see anyone suggest that they should work on tapping the power and potential of the largest search engine in the world. 

It's always social media, social media, social media, which is largely pay-to-play nowadays."
BipolarReddit,fpg99jk,t1_fpg80w7,1588597665.0,You're welcome! And I hope things go well for you and your family too.
BipolarReddit,fpg7pi8,t1_fpg4lz3,1588596534.0,"You should definitely tell that to your psych. Mental health care was atrocious when your grandma was young. It's very possible that they didn't put it in your grandma's medical records or treat her because of the stigma of mental illness and manic-depression at that time. It's very plausible.

Definitely bring that up to the psych. That really changes the context of what you're experiencing. It's important to get that clear and correct so you don't wind up hospitalized. 

If you don't want have a coming appointment, if I were in your shoes, I would call up the psych and ask to speak to them as soon as possible so you can let them know that you may have that family history. 

It's perfectly possible for it to skip around too. In my family, mental illness runs in mom's biological family, but my mom and no one else in my immediately family is mentally ill. But she was adopted. Once she reconnected with her biological family at like 50, we found out that there is a long history of severe mental illness in that side of the family. My relatives are either fully functional and happy people or severely mentally ill. There is no middle ground in my family."
BipolarReddit,fpg1dzl,t3_gd9kpm,1588591173.0,"What is a ""medic"" exactly? I'm not familiar with that title at all. If they aren't a psychologist or someone specifically trained in mental health, you'd do well to get screened by someone who is. 

It's possible to have undiagnosed Bipolar Disorder and have it aggravated by taking antidepressants without a mood stabilizer. Bipolar Disorder can manifest on the surface differently from person to person. If you or your family have a milder or highly functional version of it, it can easily get looked over.

""Too happy"" is bad if you have Bipolar Disorder. That leads to much worse things. It doesn't just stop there, particularly if you're taking an antidepressant. 

Yes, it's possible for you to have undiagnosed Bipolar Disorder and for a general practitoner type of medical professional to miss it. Your medic saying that you can't have it because you don't have a family history of it is a red flag to me that they don't know what they're talking about."

Maybe you want to hire someone to do a thing for you in the future - do you want to hand out your personal ID and password? Or would you prefer to have that set up in it's own self-contained box? 

Personally, I would just make a separate ID for the podcast before it gets to be too inconvenient to do that later.

podcasting,fpfqcps,t3_gd77c8,1588579694.0,"I work in digital marketing and I would disagree with your sentiment. It's not really a new medium at all. The roots of modern podcasting reach back to 2004. That's pre-ancient in internet time. And if you want to count things like talk radio and audio blogging, it goes back even further. 

You market a podcast the same way you market anything else. First, figure out who your target demographic is. Second, develop a product worth selling. Third, figure out where those people are. Fourth, get it in front of them wherever they are. Fifth, hone and repeat until you meet whatever metric you've assigned as ""success.""

The real issue with marketing a podcast is that, in my opinion, it seems like most podcasters aren't marketers and haven't really taken the time to understand the most important part of marketing something yourself - time and repeated effort. Unless you have a bunch of money to drop into paying someone to promote for you, you should probably be spending just as much time marketing and promoting as you do making the thing. And you will probably do that for a long time until the boulder starts rolling. 

You mention email marketing specifically. Do you already have a list or are you wanting to build one? If you already have one, where did these people come from? Are they customers from your business? Are they the type of people who listen to podcasts?"
podcasts,fpfoz65,t1_fpf0iq4,1588578313.0,"I can give you a couple points of advice, as someone that works in digital marketing.

The first is: make sure you're following the rules of wherever you're trying to promote. If the location says we don't allow promotion or self-promotion, don't promote or self-promote there. 

The second is: if you are following the rules, people who dislike advertising passionately are always going to complain. That's perfectly fine. Ignore them and do it anyway. They are irrelevant to your present and future success. Good marketing does two things. It helps you connect with the people who want what you have to offer and it disqualifies people who aren't going to ""buy"". Let me give you a practical example. If I'm selling an accounting software, do I care what people who aren't accountants think about it? No. No I do not. They aren't going to buy it. Their opinion is entirely irrelevant. Same with a candy bar. Is that potential customer the type of person to buy a candy bar? Maybe they're a devout healthy eater who does not want to eat a candy bar. Therefore, their opinion on how I sell that candy bar to people who want candy bars is irrelevant. The same thing is true for creative endeavors. Your podcast isn't going to be for everyone, and it really shouldn't be. That will only make for a very average product. 

The third is: if you're doing things right and you're still getting criticism, change the flow of the conversation. ""Of course I'm self-promoting. If I don't believe in what I'm doing, who else will?"" Don't apologize for it. Don't walk it back. Don't try to soften it. Say, ""Yes, I'm self-promoting because I have created something that I think will be valuable to other people."" Your confidence will help you convert other people who may be fence-sitters, assuming you're honest and deliver on your statement. 

Please feel free to ask if you have any questions. As a person highly recovered from Bipolar Disorder, I'm always happy to help other people in this niche with my knowledge."

I said that when you operate in the digital space you have to disclaim financial relationships and any kind of endorsements because the rules are stricter for digital than television and movies. If you post a picture or a video of yourself with a product that you've received for free or were paid to endorse, that counts as an endorsement that's supposed to be disclaimed. You don't typically get fined for it initially. You get a warning from the FTC to knock it off and comply with the regulations. 

[Here you go.](https://seedatl.com/ftcs-social-media-product-placement-rules-vs-tv-movie-product-placements/) There are two links off that article that point to FTC brand and endorsement disclosure guidelines. If you want to use a digital medium to reach an audience, those things apply. Doesn't matter if you're an affiliate blogger, podcaster, insta influencer, or vlogger.

You're right in that small things will probably fly under the radar and never get looked at, but that's true in a lot of areas. People do a lot of incorrect and illegal crap until they get called out on it. 

Your assertion about them being more concerned with data privacy and cyber security is off-base.

I had a similar experience. When I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and started learning about it, a lot of things started getting clearer. But things were still a bit fuzzy. Like when you go for an eye appointment and they are clicking through the lenses? Eventually, my kid would be diagnosed with HFA too, and when I started to research it to learn more about what was affecting him, the picture finally snapped into crystal clear focus. 

It explained so many of the things that didn't fit my puzzle of Bipolar Disorder with severe depression. For me, HFA took a fucking wrecking ball to my social processes and the way I relate to other people. A lot of the stuff that other people do naturally, I have to do manually, like projecting and interpreting body language, paying attention to the flow of everything, and knowing when to keep my mouth shut. 

I know it sucks to have to deal with this additional load while trying to get through life, but I would very much encourage you to not compare yourself to ""normal"" people. Everyone has problems and challenges to overcome and all you can ever really see on another person is the surface that they project to the world. It's impossible to know what they're carrying beneath that.

The thing I would add with dealing with stigma is that, I believe, that it doesn't always come from a hateful or even ignorant place. It took me way too long to realize that ""Bipolar Disorder"" can be a trigger for other peoples' trauma. And sometimes that came back at me as anger and conflict. 

I ran a personal blog about Bipolar Disorder for about 7 years and would get a lot of hate mail. It wasn't until a face-to-face confrontation that I realized that guy wasn't seeing me as someone with my own path and actions, he was seeing his father. The difference was that now he wasn't a scared little boy living in terror and powerless to do anything for his siblings and mom. 

If you choose to be open about your diagnosis with your friends and family, remember that they are not professionals and are not well-equipped to deal with this. Put too much on them and they can end up disappearing. 

Personally, I'm about 90% open. I save the really ugly shit for the offices of my professionals and support network that I know can handle it. And I make sure to offer those friends and family members similar support if I'm able to.

1. Make sure you pay your bills on time. If for some reason you can't or get behind, contact whoever you're going to be late to and discuss the situation with them. A lot of times you can get fees waived or some leniency if you're generally on time.

2. Slow cooker. Learn to love it. If you don't want to eat junk food regularly and don't want to cook regularly, you can meal prep for multiple days with a slow cooker. One simple recipe I ate a lot was just some boneless skinless chicken breasts with salsa in the slow cooker for about six hours on low. Drain off some of the fluid, shred up the chicken with two forks, mix the veggies back in with a little of the liquid. Great for chicken tacos, burritos, topping a salad with it, or mixing it with rice. Slow cooking is also fantastic for roasts or tougher cuts of meat because it breaks it down well. 

3. Google around and look on pinterest for bulk meal preparation in general. There are more ways to do it than just with a slow cooker. It'll keep you eating quality food. 

4. Develop routines where you can. I found it was much easier to get things done and not let them slide when I had a routine. Saturday was for cleaning and laundry. If you keep up with it, you won't have to do heavy duty cleaning or fifteen loads of laundry at once. 

5. You'll want to make an effort to stay in touch with friends or family. I found it was really easy to get pulled into day to day life with little social interaction unless I made an effort to stay connected. I'd usually use a day off to just send out a ""hey how's it going message"" to everyone about once a week."

But it's like MLM scams where you just want to create the image of success so other people buy into the bullshit, which they can then leverage to sell courses, get you to sign up, or whatever angle they're working.

""Professional image"" is a contextual issue. Yes, people with more conservative professional images are more likely to respond to other people who display a similar approach. But if you're someone who is trying to sell ""happiness"" in the form of ""fun working"" then the guru in a swimsuit is the right image.

Stable enough until the money runs out and they quietly disappear.

If you lean into what you're passionate about, then you can make something that really stands out because it's something you think about a lot, it's material you've consumed a lot of so you know what's out there, what works, what doesn't work, what interests you - and most importantly - what you want to see put out into the world. 

Every story has already been told before. You just have to find a way to make something that has your spin on it. Let me give you an example.

Knight in shining armor rescues the damsel in distress.

Liam Neeson is rescuing his daughter and her friend from human traffickers in Taken.

Arnold Scharzenegger is rescuing his daughter in Commando.

Denzel Washington is rescuing his client's daughter in Man on Fire.

I've been told I have a similar look when I crash hard the other direction. The way Bipolar Disorder manifested for me is long periods of mild to suicidal depression and the occasional hypomanic cycle. Except when I was younger, substance abusing, and living a far more chaotic and unpleasant life. Then they could get much more intense and usually bad. I manifest arrogance, paranoia, and rage; which is not a good combination at all. The main reason I even sought help in the first place is because I almost tipped into an episode where I would have ended up in jail or dead had I followed through on the thoughts the mental illness polluted my mind with.

I've known a few folks who experienced unwellness like you're describing here though. I know it's not fun at all to try and keep afloat with all of that going on."
BipolarReddit,foh4w1h,t1_foh1xfx,1587760570.0,"I'd agree with your thoughts too. The thing is that, I think, really getting a grasp of mania requires being around other people with Bipolar Disorder who experience it in different ways. It's one thing to read a few blurbs about it or try to make a judgment based off one's own experience, but it can look very different on the surface from person to person. And then you have the limitations of language in regard to the emotions and experiences of mental illness. A euphoric manic cycle looks really different from a rage-fueled paranoid manic cycle. 

Like, I'm a Type 2, and people often say Type 2 is milder than Type 1. And it is, in the same way that a Category 3 hurricane is milder than a Category 5. It's still a hurricane though. People interpret that ""milder"" in some strange ways though. 

It used to frustrate me and anger me early on but it really doesn't anymore. I now realize that it really doesn't matter in the major scheme of things. 

Joe Average is never going to ""understand"". It's beyond their ability.

As someone who was formerly emotionally constipated myself, things like counseling and working through that inability to express and feel usually does make things worse for a little while at first. It's like a dam breaking. I had all that pent up emotion and it just poured out when I started making changes to experience my emotions in a healthier way, and manage my mood disorder.

Therapy is the same way. A lot of people who experience something traumatic seal it away within themselves, often telling themselves that it's no big deal or that other people have it worse, and they don't end up emotionally processing what they need to. When they finally do decide to get help, again, it's like a dam breaking. All of that energy and emotion comes flooding out and it takes time and work in therapy to sort it out, process it, and go through it. And then there are people who aren't familiar with the therapy process that feel that discomfort and quit going, which makes things much worse for them because the dam broke, but they aren't getting the help they need to nurture and heal the wounds. They're just raw and bleeding all over. 

Don't expect to heal your hurts overnight, if you do decide to reach out to someone. It's going to take time either way. Personally, it took me about three years before I started feeling okay with a lot of the fifteen years I spent undiagnosed, with all of the fun that goes along with that."
SuicideBereavement,foftjml,t3_g799uw,1587742566.0,"So, I've been involved in mental health oriented activities, as a person with Bipolar Disorder, for about a decade now. I also work as a marketer and a writer. I've been involved in outreach efforts and trying to convince people to reach out and work on things for awhile. 

In this space, there are a lot of things that sound good, but don't necessarily work out well in life. For example, ""talk to someone about it."" That message was largely directed at people like your friend, to try to get them to reach out to someone before they took any final steps. For people like me with chronic mental illness, and people going through traumatic experiences like the suicide of a loved one, it's not good advice.

The simple truth of the matter is that the average person is not emotionally intelligent enough to navigate that kind of heaviness. People don't realize that navigating that space with someone is a skill that needs to be learned and honed, because it's not just about knowing what to say and not to say, it's also about making sure things inside of you stay healthy as well. 

Should you talk about it? Yes - in this subreddit, with a counselor, or with a support group. Talking about it with your friends that experienced that loss can be helpful too. It might also not go anywhere or go badly, as you experienced with his parents. 

You made the right choice not arguing with his parents. Their grief is going to be overwhelming for a long time and they are looking for a place to direct their anger and sadness. Hopefully, they'll eventually come to realize that it wasn't the group's fault or responsibility. Maybe they will, maybe they won't. Sometimes it's better to be kind than right.

If you really do need to talk about it and need more than being able to post here, it would be a good idea to talk to crisis service. There are a few different text lines if you feel better texting than talking. You might also want to look into services available at your university. I believe that most, if not all, have some form of counseling services available for their students. 

""Talk about it"" is such an unclear message in mental health. Personally, I never wanted to talk about shit with anyone. None of it every felt cathartic to me, probably because I'm high-functioning autistic and it took a wrecking ball to my social process. But, I still ended up going to talk therapy for about three years to work through my own traumas and mental illness. It was a very active, problem-solving oriented process rather than just ""talking about it.""

Do feel free to dump your brain out here if you feel it will help. If you're having anxiety attacks and problems sleeping, it would be a good idea to consult with a professional about what you're experiencing."
podcast,fob8uxs,t3_g5xq82,1587657312.0,"So, I'm responding to you directly here and to your conversation with /u/redhood84 in one post, for convenience.

For my day job, I work as a digital marketer, more specifically a content marketer, more specifically a writer. And I worked for doctors and attorneys for about four years ghost writing content that provided ""legal or medical information that was not legal or medical advice."" Basically, they'd give me article ideas, I'd write them, and then they'd review them to make sure there was nothing that would get them hauled in front of an ethics board. 

The key to presenting medical information without crossing any ethical boundaries is to ensure that you are not giving medical advice and always disclaim the importance of having a medical professional provide treatment. You can't say, ""Use tylenol to treat your headache."" You can say, ""Tylenol is often used to treat headaches."" The easiest way I found to keep track of this is to avoid using ""you"" statements and never directly tell people what they should or shouldn't do other than seek professional help for a problem. That might help you with your presentation.

In regard to your content, from the way you're describing it, it isn't likely that you'll push up against any ethical boundaries so long as you're not telling people how to treat their illnesses or violating anyone's privacy. Those are the things that you need to be wary of.

**About Reviews**

You commented about getting reviews and engagement. Reviews are busywork that a lot of marketers have said are important with no real proof of how important they are. We don't have access to the algorithms that Apple is using, statements made to their importance aren't rooted in anything tangible. A lot of people are just talking loudly and confidently guessing, because bullshit is a common currency for wannabe gurus and influencers. 

You're not getting reviews and engagement because you either aren't large enough to have a smattering of people that will bother nor is your content aimed to evoking the kind of emotion that would cause people to inconvenience themselves to leave reviews. 

Let me give you an example. Joe Rogan gets [200 million](http://www.insideradio.com/podcastnewsdaily/who-s-the-best-known-podcaster-survey-shows-it-s/article_a802f02a-b7a1-11e9-96a7-8ffdffa15b56.html) downloads per month according to the linked article. Apple Podcasts says he has a total of 150,000 ratings. That's not a lot of reviews for 200 million views/downloads, is it? Not even a 1% conversion rate. 

That's it. Most people do not care enough to bother leaving a review. And the content you're presenting is the kind of thing that would invoke hard emotional responses in people to get them to complain or praise loudly. Your content is very neutral and informative, so you shouldn't expect tons of reviews or engagement.

**About Facebook Marketing**

You can build a community wherever you want by driving people from your content to that particular platform, but understand that platforms like Facebook are very much pay-to-play nowadays. Back in like 2012, Facebook made a major change to their algorithm and feed displays that heavily impacted organic reach. Organic reach is what you call how far a piece of content goes without putting any money behind it. Before that, it was different. You could regularly post content on Facebook and it could get some distant reach.

Now, their system is different, and they want businesses, and people like you, to pay for that reach. 

Don't expect to do well on Facebook without a concerted marketing effort and having your target demographic zeroed in. Facebook advertising is powerful if you have money to put into it. Otherwise, it's an inefficient use of time for most people.

**About the Blog**

I'd actually encourage you not to start a blog. A blog is a creative medium, like podcasting, music, or painting. There's a difference between just doing it and doing it well. And to do it well means you have to take time away from your podcast and marketing efforts for your podcast to invest creative energy into that blog and marketing efforts for that blog. 

The primary benefit of a blog is for search engine discovery and Search Engine Optimization (SEO). People are looking for answers on search engines, blogs were an easy way to provide those answers. 

You can take advantage of that through a different means, and it's something I recommend to everyone. Episode transcripts. Google is still working on rolling out the ability to hear and understand audio content to better provide that content in search results. You can help their algorithm better understand what your content is about by including episode transcripts. There are automated and live options for getting this done and it will essentially serve the same marketing purpose that blog posts would. 

Doing a blog well would just be another time-suck on your already limited time.

**About Your Audience**

You mention repeatedly that you're concerned about your audience and not knowing who's listening. In looking at your Facebook, you have about 100 follows? And I think that other poster said you had 2000 downloads over 18 episodes? 

The way you're looking at that is incorrect. You don't really have an audience with enough information to identify a demographic to cater to. That is nowhere near enough people to determine that kind of information.

That would be like doing a single medical study of 100 people and calling that conclusive evidence to support the claim in the study. That's not nearly enough information to make that kind of determination. 

And really, when you're dealing with online marketing and content creation, people often choose their target demographic BEFORE they start making content. Or, they make content that they want to see exist in the world without really caring about what demographics find it appealing. They just make it because they want to make something. 

You can't derive meaningful marketing data out of what you have right now. It's just not possible. It's the marketing equivalent of astrology. You end up seeing what you want to see and imposing your perception on shallow information instead of interpreting good data.

**In conclusion to this long ass post...**

Personally, I don't think there's anything wrong with your current name. I think the real problem is that your approach is too broad and shallow. There isn't enough meat to really hook in people about something as complicated as an illness. Personally, I think it would have been more interesting to do it almost like seasons. Make like an 8-10 episode season on a particular illness, offering your unique perspective and using that as a way to get good interviews out of different people living different lives with it. That would probably be hard to execute on, but it would provide significant depth that is required to really make people love the thing.

I think it's also worth considering what your goals are for the podcast. Are you trying to make a major splash and have a wide audience? Because your subject matter and niche may not lend well to that. You may not be able to define your niche any further than ""people who are generally interested in illness,"" which isn't good to be a huge audience. 

Like you pointed out, your medical professional friends aren't going to be interested because it's not going to be deep. I'm sure there will be some people with illness who are interested, but speaking as someone who lives with Bipolar Disorder, I wouldn't look at a podcast like that with a single episode on Bipolar Disorder and a single interview as worth listening to. The kind of information that episode would provide would probably be very general, shallow information that I already know.

That doesn't mean that there isn't an audience out there for you, but it does mean having some reasonable expectations on what that audience may look like. It may never be large, but that can be okay if you're not trying to make bank off of it or quit being a doctor for it. It'd be great as a general creative exercise, something I always encourage people to do as much as possible. 

Anyway, I hope you find some useful info in this wall of text. Feel free to ask questions if you have any."
BipolarReddit,foap3ca,t3_g6hcyy,1587650247.0,"I don't know. I don't think there are any of my exes I would have asked for support from after we had broke up. Most of them didn't offer much decent support when we were actually together, so I wouldn't have expected them to handle things well after our relationship ended. 

I can relate to feeling like an outcast an outsider. In addition to Bipolar Disorder, I'm also diagnosed with High-Functioning Autism. And like many people with HFA, it really took a wrecking ball to a lot of the social processes that help me feel connectivity and togetherness with other people. I pretty much don't expect to relate to anyone anymore, though being around other mentally ill people who have similar struggles reminds me that there are people who relate. 

People generally aren't that emotionally intelligent though. Learning how to help someone through hard times is a difficult skill that a lot of people don't really seek out or work on. Thus, you get dumbass opinions like ""you enjoy being sad,"" as if anyone would willingly choose this bullshit to deal with. Having a hard time doesn't make you a nuisance, they're just being assholes about it. 

If you're having a hard time and need to vent, this subreddit is a good place to do it. But if you are feeling suicidal and considering action, it would be a good idea to reach out to a crisis service who can more meaningfully help you or get you help if you require it."
podcasting,fo4tsat,t1_fo49au6,1587511055.0,"Yeah. It might be time to take what you learned and try to distill it down better into your description and what you want to accomplish. If your current copy materials don't reflect who you are and what you're doing, well that's bad for two reasons. The first is that it's not the right representation of your show. The second is that it's going to annoy the people that might find that interesting, click play, and then get served something completely different."
podcasting,fo4tk4j,t1_fo48fa3,1587510936.0,You're welcome. Good luck with your talk.
podcasting,fo44o51,t1_fo446d9,1587498136.0,You're welcome. It can be hard to nail down where a strategy is misfiring when you can't get out of your own head.
podcasting,fo43ugw,t1_fo3xv54,1587497735.0,"The advice I would give is, ""Pick a distribution channel or two that makes the most sense for your audience, read up on how to market in that channel, and then do it for a long time."" 

I would phrase it that way for a specific reason. I regularly see people claim how important social media is for marketing efforts for podcasts. But that doesn't work very well the niche I've been in and want to move into with podcasting. I ran a mental health website for a long time, and most people don't want to put their mental health on blast on social media. I've had far more success in email list signups for my blog and content because it's quiet, behind the scenes, and no one else has to know about it. 

Like, it's so tilted so far in that direction that I regularly think about just deleting the two social media accounts I have. But I probably won't, because some people have used them to reach out and all."
podcasting,fo42ph8,t1_fo3s7jp,1587497179.0,"As a NE Ohioan myself, and someone who has worked in marketing for about a decade including a community-oriented site, I may be able to give you some additional perspective.

I'll start with the first and most important rule of marketing and selling anything. ""Why should I care?"" I don't know if you've noticed this or not, but NE Ohioans can be quite the territorial people. Why should anyone care what two people new to the area think about it? And why would I want to spend an hour and a half listening to two people who aren't familiar with the area give their opinions on the place I've lived for almost 40 years of my life? That's not compelling or interesting. There isn't much your surface view of the area is going to tell me that I don't already know. So why am I going to give up an average of an hour of my time to listen to your episodes? Especially when they appear to be so broad and generic. It looks and feels superficial at first glance, which is why I wouldn't give it a deeper look and hit play. 

What would have interested me more was deep dives into various aspects of Cleveland and the area. Like an audio travelers guide of impressions. ""We saw the Cleveland Orchestra at Blossom and let us tell you about it..."" ""Hey, we checked out the Cleveland Museum of Art and here's why you should visit..."" Hell, throw some humor in there too, like ""We explore why Ohio's state flower is the orange construction cone..."" And make that stuff easy to digest. A half hour or forty-five minutes of casual conversation and impressions is easier to digest. 

Not only is that interesting, but it answers the consumer's question of, ""What's in it for me?"" You can use your sense of new curiosity to pique the listener's interest about things that we can overlook in our day to day grind.

I would venture the hypothesis that your community building efforts aren't working because you have no social proof to show that people should be there. It's a real chicken or egg problem. Because people want to be a part of something that's already working. They don't want to be in on the ground floor of something that may or may not work. 

You'd be better off working on growing your podcast audience and THEN working more on your community angle. You have too many places to collect your community too. It's fragmented. The more you use, the more work you have to put in to make following it worthwhile. Your consumer is always asking, ""What's in it for me?"" 

Pick something that makes sense for what you're doing and go hard on that particular thing. Too many options is just as bad as not enough. 

I did only look at your podcast's Facebook page, and it appears you only have 100 followers there. What kind of traffic are your websites getting? Because if I looked at that social media presence, I wouldn't bother wanting to get exposure from you either. 

People don't trust ""free."" It sounds great in theory. In practice, ""free"" creates a disproportionate feeling of owing something to whoever you're getting the freebie from. Or, they assume you're up to something shady. Or, they figure there is going to be a sales pitch that follows that free thing. Or, they assume that what is being offered is junk. 

It's a drastic difference from how the general public and non-marketing people think ""free"" works versus how it actually works. Hooks like, ""sign up to our newsletter to receive this free thing!"" work because the person isn't actually getting the thing for free. They're giving over an email address and the understanding that they will be contacted in the future for sales opportunities and information, or whatever is being touted. 

Free isn't free, and we accept and understand that. Actually free brings with it a whole bunch of other complications and objections.

Also, in your post on the cleveland subreddit, your link is broken to your facebook page. It points to the wrong page."
