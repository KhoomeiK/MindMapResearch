I've also tried medication, I still take it but don't really see effects besides lowered anxiety (which is the core of my depression).

What helped save my life last autumn is therapy. I tried 3-4 therapists before over the years but it didn't help, I thought I couldn't be fixed. But my psychiatrist recommended me a therapist who uses EMDR therapy and it clicked with me! There are so many different kinds of therapy, group and individual ones, please try something new. CBT works for many people but it was so tiring and pointless to me, it made me even more depressed. EMDR was originally made for treating PTSD but it is used for other disorders too. I'm only in therapy since October, now since March I can't attend it due to quarantine but it has been a massive help to me, it seriously feels like I woke up from a coma, if you have any questions or just want to talk then just pm me, take care <3"

getting_over_it,fpjdfw2,t3_gcp2tc,1588664508.0,"is there anything you want to do? what helped me was to set one goal for the day, something productive like making a meal, or doing laundry, going for a walk, reading a book etc., would you have energy to do something like that? and at the end of the day you could write that activity down in a journal to see what you achieved that day, don't be too hard on yourself though, sometimes the biggest challenge of the day could be brushing your teeth and that's ok, if you'd like I could help you think of little activities like that, 

there's a lot of apps that help with limiting screen time, and a lot of self-help apps too

I totally get that complete lack of energy, what I really like for that is yoga and guided meditation, sometimes it's impossible to fight the sleepiness but you can still do something other than lay in bed

I think if you could start making at least one healthy meal for the day, and set a goal of a simple physical activity like going for a walk (fresh air is great for waking up!), your body will naturally gain more energy"
