landet har fallit i bitar. det är ett problem.
systemet är korrupt och dysfunktionellt för gemene man.

utredningar kan vara en bra sak, men inte om de utförs med en agenda bakom eller av människor som borde diskvalificeras.

en favorit på senare tid är utredningen som i stället för att förbjuda plastpåsar ser till att en ny skatt införs. 2,7 miljarder räknades det dra in till staten, har jag för mig.

en annan utredning resulterade i att de efter 1:a april får de installera rootkit på folks telefoner. har du någonsin laddat ned en mp3a är det nog tillräckliga skäl för att få avlyssna dig. liveview på din mobilskärm. alla dina kukbilder och fylle-sms. bäst att inte sticka upp.

problem skapas och löses med mer ordningsmakt och övervakning.
syndabockar och propaganda.
utredningar och felslut.

ser ut som att de försöker bygga om förorten till ett fängelse. fångvaktare och kameror överallt. det börjar alltid någonstans. sedan finns redan lagstiftningen där för att sedan breda ut det.

first they came for the jews.

bara ett exempel på hur man kan manipulera ett helt land med utredningar och kamerafokus.

saker kan låta bra i teorin, innan varierande mänskliga faktorer med maktbegär blandas in i formeln."
