Are you also on anti depressants by chance? Those will make mania worse. 

My entire life of being undiagnosed bipolar was spent depressed. As soon as I started lamictal I started having hypo manic episodes, but I was also on anti depressants. We are trying it again without. 

Good luck!"

Edit to add: it is significant that its only been in the last year of diagnosis and treatment that I've been able to grow, because as a bp2 woman, most of my life was the worst depression, with very few hypomanias that never destroyed my life but I was unaware was hypo.
