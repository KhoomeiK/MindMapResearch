For me (single mom) it was a bit overwhelming at first. I didn‚Äôt even know how often the diaper needed to be changed and I was so hung up about whether I was doing everything right. Then I finally got a good hold on it... and then I realized as soon as I got a hold on it, things started to change as he grew (even month to month!) I remember thinking when he was a couple months old ‚Äúonce he starts crawling it will be better‚Äù then that changed once he started crawling to ‚Äúonce he starts walking it will be a bit easier‚Äù ...well moral of the story is, it is hard and actually a bit harder then I ever imagined (unless you have the rare angel baby!) but, my son is 1 year and 7 months now, and I finally understand- yes parenting is hard, but it‚Äôs also fun, And I‚Äôve learned soooo much about myself too & I feel like I‚Äôm in a better place. From up in the middle of the night for months, attempting breastfeeding, to helping him learn to walk, eat on his own - every age has a new challenge that will replace the last one.. so like for example, yes, it was easier when he started crawling because I wasn‚Äôt having to carry him (on some sort of body carrier or just in my arms) all day long, but by that point I wasn‚Äôt worrying about carrying him anymore I was worried about the things on the floor in his path, electrical outlets (baby proof!), the pool, the stairs, etc. - anyways! Parenting has *changed my life!* and I‚Äôm really beginning to understand that I need to worry less and enjoy the given circumstances for what they are because they will never come around again. Once a milestone has past, that‚Äôs it! So, I‚Äôm blabbering at this point. But good luck on the rest of your pregnancy and enjoy your little one. Willing to help by giving any suggestions or advice in the future! (Invest in a baby breeza bottle maker!- easy for those middle-of-the-night feedings)"

No need to ‚Äúsmoke an entire blunt‚Äù by yourself or in a circle of a couple people... micro dose!!!! 1 HIT per every couple of hours. No need to be stoned out of your mind or revolve everything and every gathering around it. There are no positive effects from being a user as a teenager, but the same thing can be said about there not being many positive effects from being a user as an adult. Like everything, it‚Äôs a preference. The most important thing about it is controlling yourself and your use. & also don‚Äôt let others peer pressure you into getting super stoned or trying a new apparatus when you‚Äôre not ready to. Stand your ground. Remember marijuana is medicinal, and should be treated as a medicine and not a party favor or party drug. üå±"
