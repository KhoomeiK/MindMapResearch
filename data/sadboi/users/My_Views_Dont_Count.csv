ASU,fr41z92,t3_gmge7n,1589873092.0,"Hey, this is a long write up but hopefully it helps! I was a biochem major for 2 years before switching to EE. So as a Biochem major I essentially took the same courses a chem major would have up to that point. Well with chemistry you're first year will consist of classes you could've taken in high school as AP. CHM 117 was pretty easy IMO and CHM 118 was a tad harder, 117 is essentially just understanding and applying the states of matter and also learning about intermolecular forces while 118 (far more interesting) consists of electrochemistry, nuclear chemistry, and thermodynamics (not as hard as the later thermo classes). 

In terms of Math you need to take  MAT 270, 271, 272 which are all calc based. Ive taken all of them and will say that 270 is the easiest (easy A or B), 271is the hardest ( a lot of integrals and solving volume with integration), and 272 (Not too hard, if I could sum up this course in three words it would be: Vectors, partial derivatives). 

Now for the infamous OCHEM! Well is it really as bad as they say? Yes and no. So if your willing to put in the time to study and memorize the different configurations and bonds that associate with them then you could get an A, but i slacked and got a C both semesters, OCHEM will probably be the hardest course that doesn't require math you'll see. For the chemistry labs they take the full 3 hours but I thought they were fun, pretty much an easy A or B just be precise with your lab reports. 

For physics, you only need to take the first 2 classes which IMO were kinda hard so you'll need to put in a lot of time especially for 131. Physics labs are a joke, nuff said. And thats where i ended up switching majors because i thought biochem was SO BORING!

SO another reason i switched majors! The job outlook for chemistry is kinda terrible. If you're planning on just getting a bachelors degree or even a masters degree then you better be used to working in a lab getting paid $40,000. One of my professors told me that a bachelors degree in a science field literally means nothing except you know the basic lab procedures. You're future bosses will value a chem majors skills just as much as a biologist if both only have a bachelors degree. If you want to actually want to get somewhere with a chem degree you NEED to get a Doctorate. This will add another 3-4 years of schooling (depending if you do the 4+1 program)

Finally, what to do if you don't like chemistry. Well it seems like you must be scientifically orientated if your going into a STEM major so i suggest engineering! A warning though, if you do go into engineering be prepared for even MORE math, i'm talking MAT 275 and MAT 343 and in addition to that, all these math classes are pre reqs for every single class in the future. So what i'm saying is you better LOVE math. BUT the good news is engineering pays very well no matter what type you go into and the job growth is better than chemistry. Also you really only need a bachelors degree although there's definitely perks to getting a masters. So hope this helps! 

ps. Don't make the mistake of going into chemical engineering because it has the name chemistry in it, they are two different entities. In chemical engineering you mass produce materials and in some cases try to find the ratios for the materials involved, an example would be if a chemical engineer was overseeing potato chip production, they would need to calculate the correct amount of nitrogen to keep the chips fresh and prevent too much expansion of the gas from differing elevations."

So the good news is if you're totally committed to doing well then you have options!!!! I HIGHLY recommend getting a work book called ""schaum's outlines electromagnetics"". The best thing you can do to be good at 241 is to PRACTICE A LOT OF PROBLEMS! Throughout the course you will learn that Emag can be defined under all of maxwells equations,Understanding these equations will be the key to your success. Also this class takes the concepts used in Mat 267 and applies them (specifically Vectors)!

So to recap:

1. Practice TONS of problems from the text book and schaum's outlines electromagnetics

2. Learn when and how to use maxwells equations and also how to derive them

3. Review your vector calculus as that is a large part of E-mag

Do these things and you'll thank your self at the end of the semester! Best of luck!!!!!!!

One more thing...If your stuck don't know what law or equation to use ALWAYS GO WITH GAUSS'S LAW. You'll thank me later"

If you cheated on your thesis then maybe they'll re-open it.

One more thing, check your state laws because some states allow minors to get medical help even if the parent wont help them with it (California is an example... You only need to be 12).

It's not too late!!! To be honest Im still SUPER lazy and I still have a 2.55 GPA in college but Im a little bit more productive. SO the main source of my laziness stems from my own unwillingness to want to put any effort into anything BUT their were underlying issues as well. I was diagnosed my senior year with Schizoaffective disorder (A combination of schizophrenia and bipolar) and major depressive disorder. All of these ""disorders"" Have common symptoms of APATHY. So on top of my ingrained laziness there was also a crap load of other symptoms that contributed to this. Once I started taking Medication I felt 55% more productive :)

SO I recommend that you see a psychologist and get diagnosed because that could be part of the problem."
mentalillness,fqwho8y,t3_glacd9,1589704783.0,"Hello, I'm glad I saw your post. I was diagnosed in 2016 with Schizoaffective disorder. So I was tested with a neuropsychologist, I definitely don't recommend this because it cost about $1500. So I have several questions for you that will help me answer you're question.

1. How old are you? If your over 18 then there are OPTIONS!!
2. Do you have health insurance?
3. Did you self diagnose? Can you describe your symptoms? (it's different for everybody but obviously I have some experience in the matter)

I was extremely lucky in the fact that my mom was very inclined to help me with my problems. I let my mom know about my problems by using evidence that happened to me such as, Failing classes, being too scared to walk the dogs because I thought I was being pursued by someone, Hearing noises (specifically buzzing sounds and my name). If your mom is ignoring these issues you will have to take care of it your self. This can be a huge problem if you are a MINOR! You essentially cant go to any County based health care facility(where you could be tested and see a psychologist for VERY CHEAP) until you are 18.

If you are a minor and none of these work the only other thing I can think of is to contact your other relatives, hopefully you're close to someone and they can get you the help you need. Otherwise please answer the above questions I have for you and I will try to help."

ASU,fqstvsd,t3_gkncm6,1589618674.0,"Everything will be online for sessions C and A (still not entirely sure of B). I took Mat 265( calculus for engineers 1) online and it is entirely based on modules that have video lectures to help you learn as well as notes. The homework will be assigned through webwork (when I took it, it was through webassign). All exams will be through Respondus lock down browser and in terms of difficulty i'd say this is the easiest engineering math course, i'm assuming you're going to have to take 266 and 267 as well in which case 266 IMO is the hardest of the calc classes and 267 is not too bad (Lots of vectors!! Which you'll use if you take E-mag).  Im not sure how the english course will be set up and same with C++ but I did take CSE 100 in person and the course itself consisted of like 8 homework's and 13 labs, 2 midterms and a final. The homework can take a long time but the labs are generally short. Hopefully you didn't get dougherty cause he kinda sucked at explaining programming and I had to do a lot of outside research.

If you cant attend online classes for a week...You'll fail, at most professors will give you a couple days with a reasonable excuse for online but anything more than that and you'll be severely lacking behind in course material.

GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!"
ASU,fqryes1,t3_gk30jf,1589594555.0,"Side note: if you do end up taking EEE 202, try getting Kosut. He was an awesome professor"
ASU,fqrxl0u,t3_gkhtn0,1589594048.0,"So let me be clear, I would love to help you but your post is very vague. It would definitely help if you could clarify some things. 

1. How do you know your being accused of plagiarism? Did the Dean e-mail you or the former professor?
2. Which class was it you were being accused of plagiarism? The only ones I can think of that would catch it are english classes or lab reports, as most classes have you write on scratch paper and scan as a PDF.
3. You said that you were accused several semesters ago, why just now bring it up?
4. You also mention using canvas, I may be wrong here, but I thought we only started using canvas the spring of 2019, so my question is... what is the date of the incident? 

&#x200B;

So quick side note: As stated earlier i'm not sure of the full scenario. You say you were accused several semesters ago, if that was the case then you would have gotten an email from the dean and would have the option to attend a meeting with several people to review the case. And they most likely would've told you that you are issued a warning being a first time offender. BUT you make it seem as though no form of punishment was issued let alone getting contacted by the professor or dean??? And you're now worried about the consequences? It would really help if you clarify these points as it doesn't make sense. They wont punish you if you've already received one.

&#x200B;

Now to address what happens when you cheat at ASU: There are many threads you can look at to get some insight on what will happen. Since you are not appealing the professor of the course typically has 3 options, option 1: Give a warning, option 2: Give you a 0 on whatever you plagiarized, option 3: Give you an XE for the course ( if you're a first time offender this option is very unlikely). I VERY HIGHLY DOUBT your degree will be taken away.  So whatever the case you probably need to just relax. Again, it would help if you answer the questions I had."
ASU,fqojfgo,t3_gjwzng,1589516631.0,"Now I want you to know that I am completely on your side (you're innocent until proven guilty) but sharing more info could be very beneficial like what was it that made them think you cheated. Depending on what you were accused of the severity of punishment could be a warning or maybe an XE ( I highly doubt they'll expel you or even give an XE if you're a first time offender).

So, what should you do...Well, i'm assuming you got a notice from the dean so the next step would be they are going to meet with you and inspect your scratch paper, calculator, ect. Just remember don't say anything unless you think it will help your case. So at this point you definitely want to appeal the case, Im not exactly sure how to appeal a case but this would be a good question for your advisor. As long as 51% of the evidence is in your corner you will not be charged with anything. BUT that said if they still find you guilty and you appealed they may make your sentence even worse than if you just admitted to cheating ( I still think you're innocent btw unless proven otherwise). If you admit to cheating then it is totally up to the professor how you will be punished, they have 3 options: They can give you a warning, they can give you a 0 on the final, or they can give you an XE as stated previously.
