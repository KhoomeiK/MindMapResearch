Some people like David Foster Wallace are extremely fast learners and can reach a height the rarest of us can. Some people are also fast learners, but they will never amount to be award winning authors, other than low prestige ones. They are just not that smart.

In most books which I would call great literature it is only on the second or third readthrough that I actually learn what the hell is going on.

Also find a personal teacher. I had a really great experience with one a few years ago. Not so much about the technical aspects of writing but more in terms of the mindset that need to be shifted or altered a bit in order to make your chances of getting published better."
