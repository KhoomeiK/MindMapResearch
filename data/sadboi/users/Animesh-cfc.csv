Cricket,f87dsjs,t1_f87aap7,1574328075.0,What he meant was that the new ball swings more in the morning than in the afternoon. The pink ball doesn't reverse. Two big points from a bowling point of view.

Cricket,f878hov,t3_dzfb2g,1574320423.0,"1: I've been a bowler all my life and given that it is a team sport I'd rather want my team to win more than bat myself. Maybe you've asked the wrong people. 

2. A swing and a miss is punished. It's a dot ball for the bowling team.

3. Getting dropped is not luck. Getting dropped is almost always a mistake by the fielder. Also, the fact that the batsman scored hundred runs after getting dropped means he didn't make any costly mistakes- which means it's his skill for scoring hundred runs and not luck.

4. Does a defender scoring off a corner counted more or an own goal counted less in football? Or is a double fault counted as 10 instead of 15 in tennis? Wickets are wickets, no matter whose wickets they are.

5. Point being? Football also has 0-0 draws.

6. How many cheating incidents have you seen this year?

7. I can list 5 sports more dangerous than Cricket off the top of my head.

8. No they're not worthless.

9. You declare so that you can win.

10. I've been to many games and you can see everything.

As far as I knew, nothing escapes a black hole after it crosses the event horizon, and this wasn't anywhere near the speed of light. So does that mean it didn't interact with the black hole or its event horizon at all? 
Sorry if the question doesn't make sense, I'm more than just a little confused haha"
