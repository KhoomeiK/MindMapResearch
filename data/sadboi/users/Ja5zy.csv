You are obviously trying your best but your health is more important. These are stressful times, allow yourself to heal so you can teach at full capacity in the future instead of prolonging your sickness with undue stress on your body."

This is explaining about  [Teen abuse ](https://kidshealth.org/en/teens/abuse.html) 
 If it sounds familiar and you think it your brother's relationship may be abusive your brother is most likely very ashamed. He probably feels week and like he should deal with this on his own.

 He definitely needs to be sat down and talked to in a very loving and open way. If you guys have a good relationship with your parents bring this up with them so he gets all the support he needs and he will need therapy most likely. 

You obviously love him very dearly and it may feel like betraying his confidence by speaking to someone else about this but you are a teenager and so is he. You will need some guidance you do not have to deal with this alone. If you can not go to your parents look into a family friend or family member. Above all else,  he needs loving support.  

Here are some more links that might be helpful in looking for information on teen abuse and hotline information.

relationship_advice,fpqzyok,t3_gez8jg,1588837576.0,"I also do not like my birthday or really any major holiday much for the same reasons as you. My parents have always gotten very angry and frustrated on those days so I grew up resenting them. Maybe this is why your twin reacts this way now? 

My best advice is to find joy in the small things right now. If you can try and get a candy bar or some sort of treat for yourself. If you and your twin have a good relationship maybe you guys can just watch a movie together or play a game. 

My longterm advice would be to surround yourself with people who you feel safe with on your birthday. It's hard to try and enjoy a day thats always been filled with negative feelings so this is the most important. When you feel safe enough you are able to slowly learn to enjoy these days again and find the fun that should have been there all along. Maybe you won't even celebrate on your birthday. I know many people celebrate on there half birthdays instead of there real birthdays as well. 

I hope this helps in any way."
relationship_advice,fpqz0vw,t3_geztcw,1588836679.0,"I have personal experience with this. My best friend since 10 has a really big problem with co-dependence on her partners to the point she won't leave unless they do. It is so so hard to watch her pain and to see her in these positions no matter what. She like your friend has deeper issues. She has started to go to therapy. She realized she might have some problems and wants to better herself and figure it out. I would recommend doing what I did by being honest and saying ""I love you and support you fully and I think you would really benefit from going to therapy to help you find better solutions then we(her friends) can offer"". OP you sound like a amazing friend and you need to be honest with her about this. Sometimes people need to be told the ugly truth to get better."

Is your mom somehow homebound? Does she maybe have a mental illness that could be contributing to the problem? If so there are programs and help available to her and you or therapy she can attend. These will take time and work. 

I would start by having a really open conversation and make it clear your not judging her or looking at her in a negative light(she might feel like a terrible mother and deflect in anger) and express how much you are hurt by being put in your position and just want her to get better so you both can live better."

You deserve to have friends who truly care about you and love you and want the best for you. You are totally able to drop people who are crossing boundaries or who don't feel genuine in there relationship. It can be really hard to find friends and work up those relationships and sometimes I feel like I'm missing out on some sort of life because I dont have many friends either. I would recommend joining some sort of group like a beach clean up, D&D group, reptile enthusiast, volunteer at a shelter? Do something you love and meet people there and build off of that. If you have a hard time with mental illness and really connecting you could also try group therapy. This way when you are volunteering and or in group you have set meetings to bond over shared interest and can expand from there and really build a good friendship. I hope this helps in some way:)"

I think telling family and friends is a person by person basis you'll need that support system and it helps better your relationships when they can understand why you do certain things. If you have hesitation of telling someone theres great youtube videos that simplify bipolar disorder and those are great tools. Also don't feel obligated to tell someone if your uncomfortable about it this is your life, you have the right on letting people in. On learning how to live (I'm still in the process) but I've found identifying my emotions as I'm feeling them helps alot just telling myself my own emotions helps me stay more grounded almost.
