TravelNoPics,fqay928,t1_fqar1pk,1589227346.0,"Hmm this is a good point, I'm not sure really! I am certainly familiar with where I live now so I don't feel unsafe here, I guess it just takes me a while to feel at ease in a new place though. For example when I've travelled in the UK alone I've been a bit on edge because I'm not familiar with the rail network and I could easily make a mistake, but I'm not really in *danger*, just might mess up. 

To some extent though I think it's important to maintain at least a little bit of that ""unsafe"" feeling. Certainly not to the point where it ruins your trip, but being cautious can be a blessing. I've been to some places that some would say aren't safe and I don't think it would be wise for me to completely let my guard down in that situation. Maybe wary is a better word. Or sensible!

I was meant to go on a trip with a bunch of uni friends in April, obviously it didn't happen but I have a feeling it would have been a little chaotic if not friendship-destroying as we're all on very different wavelengths! I have not yet found the perfect travel partner I think, but my search continues. In the meantime, alone it is!

Where have you been in Asia? I've been to a lot of SE Asia but other areas not at all, I'd love to change that."
TravelNoPics,fqagxg8,t1_fqag840,1589218882.0,"> The worst thing on a trip for me is to end up at a hostel that's just dead - everyone there is keeping to their own groups and in bed by 10.

This is mostly what my experience with hostels has been, but I'm sure that has a lot to do with travelling with my parents! The balance you describe sounds great, I will definitely store this knowledge away for when travel is feasible again.
