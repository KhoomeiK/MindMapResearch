exchristian,fdjr8b5,t3_ellan2,1578484450.0,"The way Christians treat you after you tell them you want to leave the church is horrifying (at least in my experience). Parents don’t support their children because of their faith, these kids are their own flesh and blood. The church degrades you if you don’t live by their standards, they condemn you to hell. Church for me is hell. Those who attend usually act so high and mighty compared to others. There are disgusting things hidden in the Bible’s pages but everyone is too busy cherry picking to see them."

I know some anti-vaxxers don’t use medicine but a lot probably do.

Not to mention the sixth commandment says, “thou shalt not kill.” Capital punishment is murder, so why does the church condone it? Shouldn’t God be able to decide when someone dies rather than people? Who’s to say that if the prisoner lived and wasn’t executed he would’ve found god and renounced his wrongdoings."
