CPTSD,fpq87ca,t1_fpprc46,1588817133.0,"Developed by Dr. Marsha Linehan to help herself recover from Borderline Personality Disorder, DBT focuses on acceptance of current emotions in order to learn how to change them when they are ineffective. It is the most effective treatment for patients with BPD, but it is also effective in treatment of addictions, trauma and self-harm regardless of psychiatric diagnoses.

&#x200B;

Side note: the DSM is limited to PTSD and BPD but may be updated within the next few years to include more diagnoses for trauma survivors - there is a wealth of new information on trauma missing from most psychiatry practices. Even CPTSD isn't listed in the DSM yet.

&#x200B;

In ""The Body Keeps the Score"", the most effective solution for trauma is a multi-pronged approach: DBT, trauma-processing therapy (exposure, CBT, or EMDR), and support groups/relationship-building/physical movement.

&#x200B;

EDIT: in my personal experience and from what I have read in literature, trauma is not effectively treated within the psychiatric community. Western medicine places too much emphasis on medicating and pathologizing rather than processing normal responses to abnormal events. I have had to become proactive in my approach to recovery and in times of crisis, I have had to learn how to advocate for myself, my symptoms, and what I need for help because the healthcare system has not caught up with current research. Distressing at first but worth it over remaining complacent and repeating destructive cycles."

Sober,fp0guxv,t3_gaktig,1588209010.0,"definitely both. I am in the middle of the first week of withdrawals from nicotine and THC. You will feel SO much better in a few days and even better/normal in a few weeks. ""psychological"" withdrawal is also physical tbh, it just means your dopamine system is adjusted to whatever amount of THC you were dumping into it, and now youre experiencing a lack. When we don't have enough dopamine coursing through our neurons, we tend to feel exactly as you described: angry, irritable, anxious, depressed, unable to fall and stay asleep, and you might also be experiencing bouts of crying (I know I am, haha). Your brain will naturally begin to produce more dopamine as it adjusts to the ongoing absence of THC.

&#x200B;

as for nicotine, irritability, anxiety are withdrawal symptoms.

&#x200B;

cravings are natural too but they tend to subside 10 minutes after cropping up. and they will crop up less and less as time goes on.

&#x200B;

If you can get your hands on melatonin supplements for the insomnia, I recommend it. 

Hot baths, tea, emotional/sentimental TV/books to cry the sadness out (it's ok to be a ""little bitch"" especially right now - your poor brain is experiencing withdrawal so be kind to yourself) can all help. Even better if you have a trusted friend, partner or family member to vent to when you feel overwhelmed by the emotions you've been dampening with THC for so long. I'll say it again: be kind to yourself. And remember that with the increased unpleasant emotions also comes an increase in positive emotions :) 

&#x200B;

Godsend for elevating mood during withdrawal AND speeding up the withdrawal process: EXERCISE. Preferably intense so your body burns fat, where THC is stored. It can feel a little dream-like after a run when you're withdrawing from THC and the stored THC floods your bloodstream so just be aware of that haha.

JustNoSO,f6ddch2,t3_dqz9ah,1572793371.0,"Your turn to analyze his behaviour.

You can only be aware of and control your own behaviour, but you cannot control someone else's. However, you can be aware of their behaviour and how it impacts you.

Is it healthy behaviour? Unhealthy? Abusive? Do some research, parallel it to your relationship, and come to a conclusion.

&#x200B;

I have been with a narcissist/sociopath (it's a spectrum ranging from tendencies to full blown personality disorder) and he frequently used something called ""reactive abuse"" to keep me in the relationship, and as a result more in control of his supply (me).

Do I have some unhealthy relationship skills? Yes. Are they abusive? No. Can some of my behaviour be labelled ""mean""? Sure, but insensitivity is a trait some men and women possess and flaws + arguments = ""youre mean"" sometimes. Doesn't mean it's abuse.

Did he frequently and unpredictably lash out at me, his family, or, occasionally, total strangers? Yes.

Did he reduce me to tears with name-calling, emotional manipulation, belittling, and lies? Yes.

Did this dynamic escalate over time with ""honeymoon periods""? Yes.

Does he still believe I was the abuser, the problem, that if /I/ stayed with him and changed, we could have been successful and happy together? YES, frustratingly.

&#x200B;

Bearing this in mind, research reactive abuse, narcissism and sociopaths, cluster B personality pathology, and compare yourself to him objectively. Does he have trouble keeping friends? Good/bad relationship with family?And what about you? What were you like before the relationship? And now?

You will be able to soundly conclude whether he is the main issue after digesting this material, but the hardest part is leaving. I knew all of this about my partner and yet I chose to stay. Abuse is addictive by design. It's similar to stockholm syndrome. They make you feel like shit, but then make you feel much better later during the honeymoon and apology period. Then the cycle repeats so often you forget who you are anymore without them or their abuse. The best odds of getting out are keeping closer ties with those who lift you up (family, good friends etc) than the ties you have with an abuser.

If your situation is similar to mine, I urge you not to try to call him out or convince him of any of this. The nature of people with narcissism and sociopathic traits is that they quite literally do not have the brain wiring to see people the way psychologically sound people do. These problems are, at their core, pathological insecurity manifested as projection (They don't /know/ they are abusive, not even deep down - all they know is a world full of people who can prop them up and make them feel good, and god be damned if they fail at it). ""You're the abuser, youre the problem, you caused this, that, the other thing, etc"" It's a horrifyingly bizarre brain phenomenon and a sore reminder that none of us are immune to the darkest parts of humanity.

I will say one thing though, if you do show him this or call him out, he will become irate and explosive. When I called out my ex, he would find any excuse for his behaviour and in the same breath he would repackage the truth, miscontrue, full on fabricate, and outright belittle me for my behaviour by attacking my flaws and thereby convincing me /I/ was the abuser.

&#x200B;

Best of luck. I hope you're not in my past situation. I learned a lot and grew after I left."
