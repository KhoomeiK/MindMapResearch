Plus, (but idk since I’m not an expert) he even admitted he didn’t even hit her (more like emotionally abused) which I’m not condoning in anyway. 

Even if he did do that. He also raised multiple charities for families and children. He even got shot because he had the money he was going to use to donate.

You can downvote me to hell or call me a fuck boy but you can’t argue with facts."
AskReddit,fpj8gpk,t3_gdn8w2,1588659775.0,"lol this is ironic since i was just crying about how shitty my mom is lol.

give genuine affection

give constructive criticism (not criticism)

admit when i’m wrong

feel like they can confide to me 

not give them ultimatums

allow them to be able to be who they truly are. not have them feel like they have to change for society

not favor one child over the other (or atleast not telling them who’s the favorite and tell them you’re the least favorite.

laugh at their jokes and build self esteem.

tell them why instead of just “because i said so,”

not blame them for feeling a certain way towards something

and a bunch of other shitty stuff she does."
depression,fp5kktk,t3_gaxui1,1588332658.0,"I used to have deep depression for a few years and then one day I realised I just felt better. I was smiling while walking to school for no reason. When this wasn't a phase I started to realise I was happy again. 

It's a scary feeling too because its something you're not use to. But, now I have to keep myself sailing. You're scared that even if you take a second to rest (cry, have a little bit of depression) than you'll go back to that sinking feeling you had. 

Honestly, I never thought i would get to where i was today but i did. and yall can do it too. :)"

so here’s the things i would’ve missed out on:

xxxtentacion’s ‘News/Flock’ finally being found

being able to draw on my ipad (i waiter a whole year for that thing so i was pretty excited lol)

seeing my best friend all the way until she left late summer time :(

playing with my nieces and nephews and seeing my oldest niece about my age since we don’t see each other a lot.

watch my favorite tv show Miraculous Ladybug which had me so emotional.

seeing frozen 2

making smoothies

i know there’s not a lot and mostly about dumb kid stuff but i’m still a kid so i’m just trying to do the best right now."
