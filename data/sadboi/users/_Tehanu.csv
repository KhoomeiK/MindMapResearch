womensfashion,folbs1l,t3_g7ocso,1587858885.0,"Since summer is coming . . . I love having a couple of casual jersey dresses that I can throw on when it‚Äôs too hot for jeans. I usually go with black dresses since they can skew more formal or casual, depending on the look. Ann Taylor and Old Navy have a pretty good selection and sometimes Anthro. (And all have fantastic sales!). You could also wear a casual black jersey skirt with a t shirt?

If you want to stick with leggings, I feel like a casual blazer with flats or slip on sneakers is always an instant upgrade to any look. J crew has some sweater blazers. H & M also has a good selection. Great for going out too."

I try to avoid looking in the mirror too and have moved a couple. It‚Äôs really helped me when I do catch myself in a mirror- it doesn‚Äôt feel as important somehow.

I was going to suggest the frosted window decals too. There are some that look like stained glass, which could be a pretty decoration. They‚Äôre also really easy to remove if that‚Äôs a concern. I also love the idea of posting inspirational quotes or even pretty pictures (I love the pics in National Geographic and architectural digest).

Honestly, this time has been so difficult that that‚Äôs a huge win in and of itself. I certainly wouldn‚Äôt beat yourself up for struggling/falling off the bandwagon. Recovery is just a long process and it doesn‚Äôt happen in a linear fashion.

Others have suggested a meal plan and timed eating. That has also been very helpful. I also bought some ensure and soup. For me, drinking something is easier than eating. 

It also helps me to remember that restricting really, really exacerbated the depression. I‚Äôll feel so much worse if I don‚Äôt eat- having no energy, volatile mood, feeling like I constantly want to cry. 

But it‚Äôs just really hard now that we‚Äôre isolated and just stuck inside with no routine. I hope you can be kind to yourself- that‚Äôs always been the most important thing for me!"

This quarantine has made everyone‚Äôs mental health plummet, so it really tugs at my heart to learn that someone is making their kid miserable like that. And the fact that it‚Äôs a parent that previously abandoned and abused their child (watching you get abused and taking no action=failure to protect, kicking a 14 y/o child into the streets=abuse). I‚Äôm so sorry you have to deal with this invalidation. Your parent should be the one trying to prove themselves to you, trying to make things up. It breaks my heart that not only are they not doing that, but they‚Äôre also making these incredibly hurtful statements. 

I used to shrug off those invalidation attempts but I realized lately that I tend to internalize the invalidation when I do that and it brings all the shame and self-loathing back. Just thought I‚Äôd share in case you experience something similar.

Like others have said, there are so so many trans or non-binary people that are AMAZING parents, even if they are personally in pain from being closeted. I‚Äôm sorry your parent treated you like this and I hope they don‚Äôt offer up being trans as an excuse.

And finally congratulations on all you‚Äôve accomplished- getting your GED, sobriety. That‚Äôs truly amazing."

relationships,fnce6mc,t1_fnbr06a,1586834596.0,"I‚Äôve had Mirena for 6 years and absolutely love it. I used to be on loestrin, which zapped my sex drive, gave me horrible migraines and fatigue and nausea. With Mirena, I don‚Äôt get my period at all, which is amazing. I also don‚Äôt have any of the side effects I had from oral birth control.

Getting it put in sucked but was over in like 3 minutes. The doctor gave me some numbing stuff that made me dizzy, I felt cramping when she inserted it and then it was done. The first couple of months were rough because I had bleeding off and on. I did have some cramping and nausea afterward but that only lasted a couple of weeks (maybe a month). I did have some dizzy spells that first month but maybe just because I was eating less or became mildly anemic from bleeding too much.

Everyone is different and some have a really bad experience on Mirena. 

And I tend to agree with everyone else- your bf should wear a condom and doesn‚Äôt get a say in whether you are on BC. But I totally respect that you have a different take on his position. Whatever your decision is, just hope it‚Äôs the right one for YOU"

EatingDisorders,fmrp1uu,t3_fw82ne,1586330301.0,"I struggled a lot with this too. That really sucks that your family is like that and that‚Äôs awesome that you‚Äôve made all this progress without them. My mom has a lot of disordered eating behavior. She used to call and brag about how she was starving herself (knowing I had an eating disorder). I stopped talking to her about food, exercise and body image. I explicitly told her not to bring up those topics. She sometimes doesn‚Äôt listen- I know I should end the conversation and walk away from her when she does that. Easier said than done though.

It helped to recognize that I don‚Äôt want to end up like her. Once I looked at her more objectively I realized she was pretty sad. She‚Äôs in her 60s and still obsessing about looking thin. When do you find something more meaningful to fill your time? I don‚Äôt want to be that.

Not sure if any of that helps. Sorry you‚Äôre stuck with your family and I hope you can get some space from them."
AmItheAsshole,fmjc14b,t3_fva7id,1586127239.0,"Ngl when I first read about the passwords, my mind went real quick to YTA. But from reading your responses to other people, I got some additional perspective. Here‚Äôs what I heard: 1) when he said no to password sharing, you didn‚Äôt press him and respected his boundary; 2) you made it clear to him that the feeling of mistrust was an unpleasant feeling stemming from past hurt. You also made it clear that that feeling wasn‚Äôt his fault and that you just need time to get to 100% trust. That is really really common among people getting over relationship trauma and nearly always comes up in a new relationship. Feelings aren‚Äôt rational or fair and wishing them away or stuffing them down usually just causes them to grow louder. Ideally, you‚Äôd be able to voice those feelings so you can work through them. It sounds like he heard you say that he was untrustworthy and that there was something wrong with him, even though that wasn‚Äôt your intent. The word trust can be a hot button- I find other feeling (anxiety, panic, fear) or even visceral reactions (stomach in knots, muscles tensing, heart beating) easier to understand and don‚Äôt have the same undertone of judgement. But I heard you articulate your emotions really well in the comments, so I bet you have a lot of great skills to have a follow-up conversation with him.

Finally, worthwhile to say that emotions are running high for everyone right now, especially couples that are isolated together (can‚Äôt remember if your post included that). Hope you guys can hang in there!

PS I also find the relationship sub really helpful for posts like this. Less of a who‚Äôs right, who‚Äôs wrong and more of a problem-solving space."

femslash,fiwfla3,t1_fiw1hos,1582784091.0,"Yeah def- most media is about men and women‚Äôs characterization is often less complex and multidimensional than men‚Äôs. I just feel that‚Äôs been amplified in fan fiction, where there was an opportunity to push against that trend. Media is also staunchly heteronormative, yet that same trend clearly didn‚Äôt bleed over into fan fiction. Fanfic authors gave stories of rich, complex lgbtq+ characters when there were almost none in media. So they‚Äôre not always basing content on what was produced.

And in case this wasn‚Äôt clear initially- I‚Äôm not judging anyone or saying what they should or shouldn‚Äôt do. I honestly don‚Äôt have that big of an investment in fanfic. I just think it‚Äôs interesting what people (in general) are or aren‚Äôt doing.

IDK what you mean by ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù versus ‚Äútalented‚Äù writers"
femslash,fivzrwd,t3_e0y9pk,1582771769.0,"I just stumbled on this sub and this article in particular- it was a really interesting read. It articulated really well some reasons I‚Äôve heard for why so many women write male slash fiction.

I also wish the article had discussed some of the ramifications of focusing on mostly gay, white cis men (although there are MANY great works based on other gender and sexual identities). In their quest to write a relationship with an equal power balance, that challenges gender norms and in which women aren‚Äôt objects, it‚Äôs interesting that women so often turn to m/m rather than f/f (or other gender orientations). They just write themselves out of the romance (or sex or intimacy) completely. And that‚Äôs totally fine- whatever floats your boat. But (like all media) it does center the experience of white cis men- it redefines *their* gender roles and *their* sexual experiences and *their* intimacy. There‚Äôs a growing question of whether it‚Äôs appropriate for women to do that. There‚Äôs also the question of why more women aren‚Äôt inspired to write stories reshaping female sexuality and gender roles or exploring female emotions, trauma, success. I‚Äôm not judging anyone- women get enough judgement and shame about their sexuality as it is (and maybe that judgement, shaming causes them to write themselves out of the picture where sex is concerned). But I also think it‚Äôs worth being/staying curious about. 

Regardless, the author made some really great points about slash and it‚Äôs potential. Thanks for sharing a fascinating read!"

MarvelStudiosSpoilers,fhqb9c8,t3_f401bv,1581801824.0,"I wonder why everyone is so invested in one of two particular actors being the lead when there is an entire cast stacked with talent?

I‚Äôm expecting a true ensemble film- with multiple characters being integral to the storyline. I‚Äôm sure some will have more screen time than others but I‚Äôll be disappointed if this is actually a film centered on 1-2 people with everyone else in the background. I also really want Gemma to have her own storyline, not be wrapped up in some knock-off Game of Thrones love triangle- that just sounds cringeworthy."

CPTSD,fgczqb6,t3_exi8r9,1580677675.0,"I‚Äôve been a caregiver. Your post broke my heart. It really does take a toll- caregivers of people with PTSD have higher rates of depression and anxiety. They can also become socially isolated and consumed with their family member‚Äôs health. I‚Äôm glad that you‚Äôre in individual therapy and hope that helps bring you some relief.

I saw a lot of advice about how you can help your family but also wanted to chime in that it‚Äôs ok if you need to just focus on helping *you* right now. Setting [boundaries ](https://psychcentral.com/lib/10-way-to-build-and-preserve-better-boundaries/)  can be crucial when dealing with someone with cptsd/ptsd. It‚Äôs ok to say no to chores/ tasks/emotional labor, to let your family know that you‚Äôre on overload. Maybe have some calming tasks that you can turn to if you feel emotionally overwhelmed- going for a walk, listening to music. Something that you find healing. It can also be useful to have a backup support person so everything is not dumped on you. In the meantime, what about doing some fun things with friends, other family, coworkers? Hell even going to a movie by yourself or calling an old friend/family member to chat. It can be crucial to have a support network of people that are just there for you.

An important lesson I had to learn- people who support people with mental illness get inundated with advice about what they should/shouldn‚Äôt do. But sometimes it‚Äôs easy to forget that that advice does not equal responsibility (and we get socialized to think everything is our responsibility). As in, it‚Äôs not your responsibility to manage their triggers, ease the mood swings, take on all the daily chores they can‚Äôt do. You can be empathetic, learn where they‚Äôre coming from, help out as you‚Äôre able and comfortable, *without sacrificing your needs and health*, but at the end of the day, you can‚Äôt control or fix them. When I lose empathy, can‚Äôt manage to complete the smallest task for them (or myself), or my mind goes to a dark place of saying they‚Äôre purposefully trying to hurt me (even though I know they have a disease), then it‚Äôs time to check out fast and go take care of myself.

And it‚Äôs unacceptable for your wife to yell at you over nothing. IMO, that‚Äôs a good time to walk away and let her know you‚Äôll talk to her when she‚Äôs calm. It‚Äôs *completely* understandable that she‚Äôs struggling with anger, with everything she‚Äôs been through. But that‚Äôs not carte Blanche to mistreat others. Also, it could be a really healthy thing for your kids to see that violence (and yelling is a form of violence) is unacceptable and won‚Äôt be tolerated. Modeling healthy behavior can be extremely powerful.

Finally, not sure if this would be helpful or relevant at all, but have you looked into [codependency ](https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/health-fitness/mental-health/is-your-relationship-codependent-and-what-exactly-does-that-mean) [literature ](http://coda.org/index.cfm/meeting-materials1/patterns-and-characteristics-2011/) . Again, this might not at all be relevant to you. But a lot of partners of partners of people with mental illness find it useful. If it is helpful, you could chat with your therapist about codependents anonymous meetings.

Anyway, I just wanted you to know I was thinking of you and wishing you the best! I definitely feel for you and hope things get better soon. And, of course, please take all of my words and links with a grain of salt :)."

If you‚Äôre making the claim, isn‚Äôt it on you to back it up?

‚Äúbut a quick search online will verify that Disney does this shit all the time, regardless what you believe about it.‚Äù

Did that quick search. I found an article from Cosmic Book News (the most reputable of sites!) claiming this could have happened and a bunch of reddit, 4chan, and quora posts offering anecdotes from theater staff about empty seats. Hardly irrefutable proof.

There is a report from [marketwatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/disney-whistleblower-told-sec-the-company-inflated-revenue-for-years-2019-08-19?mod=hp_investing) about a former  parks and resort  accountant who claims that the parks inflated revenue.

MoneyDiariesACTIVE,f44oqvy,t3_djb508,1571356225.0,"I really appreciated this MD. Sometimes, the people writing MDs have their lives so very put together ( meal prepping for the entire week! Maxed out my 401k! Making extra house payments!), that I feel like a total mess after reading them. It sounds like she‚Äôs in the early stages of processing a lot of trauma and I got a clear picture of how that was impacting her finances directly and indirectly. Mental heath struggles impact your life in so many devastating ways. I also struggled with an eating disorder- not sure if this applies to OP but many who do also struggle with compulsive spending. 

Mental health problems can influence how you make decisions, what you prioritize and plan for and your ability to control impulses.  If you feel so terrible in the moment that you can‚Äôt handle what you‚Äôre feeling, you‚Äôll likely reach for the first thing that makes you feel better. And that may involve spending money. It‚Äôs bad in the long term but thinking about the long term is impossible if you can‚Äôt even imagine getting through the short term. When you have generalized anxiety, you logically know that taking a shower is not really going to dirty the tub, but that logic can be completely powerless in the face of this feeling of overwhelming panic at a dirty tub. You act to ease the panic because you‚Äôre terrified of that feeling and need to do whatever you can to lessen or avoid it. Paying for a blowout may be a maladaptive coping strategy but it has its purpose in the moment. I‚Äôve definitely been there and the only way my financial life improved was to improve my mental health and to try to forgive myself for past mistakes. 

Despite all that, I could tell she was taking some healthy financial steps. It sounds like the beauty store job gave her a fun outlet and helped her pay down debt in a way that felt manageable for her. She referenced times when she was able to talk herself out of purchases- I got the sense that that was maybe something she previously struggled with. That‚Äôs great that she was in therapy and she clearly is someone with tremendous insight into her thoughts and behavior.

Finally, for someone who struggles with vulnerability and intimacy as much as she does, it was incredibly brave and generous of her to be so open and honest. I really admire her for that."

MoneyDiariesACTIVE,f3rfcpr,t3_dhrman,1571087536.0,"Bought 2.5 years ago. Main takeaways are similar to others:

1) Find a good realtor. I had to ‚Äòfire‚Äô the first realtor that came recommended by a friend. She was very sweet but she didn‚Äôt know a lot and wasn‚Äôt a clear communicator. It was hard to part ways- I‚Äôm not one for conflict- but so worth it. I got a recommendation from someone in the business and could instantly tell that this realtor was knowledgeable, honest and direct. He knew how to negotiate but also knew what was reasonable.

2) Know the market. I bought in a seller‚Äôs market. I had to get pre-approved and knew I would have to make a decision almost instantly in a house. I also thought a lot beforehand about how I would react in a bidding war- how much I would increase my offer by, what concessions I could make and how I could be an attractive buyer in general. So glad I did this because 3 offers were submitted on my house. I kept a cool head, came up a nominal amount and was prepared to lose rather than overpay. Low and behold, my offer was accepted. I still got about a 3% reduction because of stuff found during inspection. I passed on some other houses that I knew would get 8-10 offers (no joke). Also, the more offers there are, the higher the chance of a cash offer, which will nearly always beat out an offer tied to a mortgage (even pre-approved).

3) Everyone says this, but I was surprised at how expensive owning a home was. Repairs and maintenance are always just more than you think they‚Äôre going to be. Definitely echo others about not overspending and making sure to have 20% down.

4) It‚Äôs ok to freak out at least once, if not multiple times during the process üòâ. I panicked and almost threw up after my offer was accepted. Having a friend or family member that can talk you off a ledge is invaluable.

5) Trust yourself. You get an inexcusable amount of advice, often unsolicited, that contradicts itself or is unhelpful, irrelevant and unnecessary. Don‚Äôt let people talk you into doubting yourself. You are the most qualified at knowing what‚Äôs best for you."
marvelstudios,f3qz8ys,t1_f3q5ods,1571082737.0,"She could absolutely be both! I don‚Äôt think straight women would turn from her if she was in a relationship with another woman. If you think about it, women with traditional gender norms probably already don‚Äôt like Captain Marvel and they‚Äôre likely the ones that would have a problem with her being queer. But I‚Äôm not sure Disney is ready to make someone with a lead role in the MCU an lgbtq character (we‚Äôll see how big a role this eternals guy gets- maybe I‚Äôm wrong)."
womensfashion,f3otbdy,t3_dhibeo,1571027963.0,"Levi‚Äôs and American Eagle do the same thing to me. I second Madewell- Hands down my favorite brand for jeans. Also, would a belt help with your current jeans? Or do they get loose all over?"
marvelstudios,f3o3yo1,t3_dhbbm9,1571007807.0,"I thought Brie was just playing to the crowd when she said that (not at all trolling because the crowd loved the idea üíï). Brie and Tessa said themselves they have no idea what‚Äôs in store for their characters. A lot of queer girls ship them but not sure Disney will go there- especially if Captain Marvel takes a central role in the MCU. And totally agree with others that a romance would be difficult between those two (but sometimes that makes for a good story!).

Also you threw out some uncertainty about whether Captain Marvel is an icon for women and girls. Most of my friends love her, I love her, so, in my circle, she‚Äôs absolutely iconic. I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of women who disagree.  But she definitely has a following!"

bisexual,f329pld,t3_df9rpz,1570598702.0,Watched it yesterday! I really liked Ruby- I thought she had great screen presence and was stellar in the more dramatic scenes. The love story is amazing and beautiful and the pilot set up some interesting family dynamics. It had some clunky dialogue but nothing out of the ordinary for a CW superhero show.
actuallesbians,f2yy0dt,t3_desvo2,1570501185.0,"Just finished it! I thought the pilot set things up nicely and the romance was really beautiful to see. Already bought the season.

marvelstudios,f2xtfwd,t3_decc0q,1570482318.0,"Ikaris, Sersei, Makkari, and Kingo for me. I also love Chloe Zhao and found her approach to film making (hiring non actors to act in film, creating this film that‚Äôs kind of a work of fiction, kind of a documentary) fascinating and bold. I can‚Äôt wait to see what she does with a Marvel movie.

And honestly the strong and unique cast is really what attracted me to this film in the first place. We‚Äôll get to see a superhero who communicates through sign language, a male superhero with a husband, a woman over 50 as a leader, a superhero with some of the sharpest comedic instincts in the business. Every member of the cast brings an amazing acting ability and a strength that we haven‚Äôt seen before. I just really hope the film does them all justice."
