Their ""world-view"" is evil, even if they don't think so. Most evil people don't think they're evil. I understand their beliefs are different, but I think those beliefs are truly evil. Saying that it's just how they were raised doesn't excuse them for believing in a hateful and hostile agenda. They are antisocial."
SuicideWatch,fmz0p79,t1_fmz0095,1586502061.0,"Yeah. Denying climate change and actively increasing pollution, no respect for the supposed separation of church and state, no respect for a woman's right to choose, an anti-science agenda, removing protections for the ""dreamers"", separation of families at the southern border, using ICE like a gestapo hit squad... the list goes on. 

On top of all that, what ready irks me is that he constantly says things that are so blatantly untrue,and his supporters somehow accept what he says as fact even though they themselves know it to be false. It's remarkable. He could say the sky is purple and his supporters would look up at the blue sky and then agree with him. That is so depressing to me."
