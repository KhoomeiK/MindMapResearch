sex,fjf9swz,t3_fd5o8y,1583287326.0,I feel this. This is EXACTLY how i am with my husband. Ive never really had an issue with them in general but when I go down on him it's like my most favorite thing. I just enjoy the whole experience instead of mostly waiting for it to be over. We've been together for 7 years now so I guess that's a good sign.

relationship_advice,fhrwemh,t3_f4nwdd,1581841884.0,As someone who is mentally ill I can honestly say the biggest help to me personally is that I just want to feel important. I want to feel like I matter to someone else the way they matter to me. I just want to feel like I matter. Right now I'm super low so I can relate to her. I don't self harm but I've been very close. I know the feeling of relief you get when you can do something to control the pain your physical body feels. I just took a scalding hot shower because I thought it would make me feel better. It did not. I hope you find a way to help her. This is just what works for me.

You and your decision to end the relationship shouldn't change based off his decision to not handle it well and spiral out of control.

I'm married so my spouse is the only person who sees that part of me so I'm not so self conscious when the hair grows back down there. But keeping it maintained is very tough.
