Anxiety,ezyezcs,t1_ezxsvtu,1568266863.0,"I've had to leave work to go to the ER twice in the last year due to panic attacks. It's embarrassing, I really didn't want to go back.

But, as soon as I told someone that it had happened I felt so much better.

If you can you might look up box breathing or the 4-7-6 breathing method before your meeting. It's a big help."
Anxiety,ez20yhn,t3_czqtqt,1567651933.0,"One note here: it can go the other way too, so when in doubt check with a doc. I blamed my stomach aches on anxiety for years. Turns out I am celiac...

So for years I suffered constant nausea, constipation, bloating, and pain because I told myself it was all in my head.

Don't make my mistake! If you are feeling dietary symptoms try an elimation diet, see a doctor, or at least avoid common trigger foods (dairy, wheat, soy, etc) for a week, see if the side effects are reduced."
