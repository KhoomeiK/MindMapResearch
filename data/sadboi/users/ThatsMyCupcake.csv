I rate myself 11/10 for fear of flying. I can only describe my methods as a grab bag of what works for me. I have a low grade muscle relaxer, I take 1. I also take along headphones so I can use my Calm meditation app, I have an acupressure ring I run up and down my fingers for a sensory distraction. I keep all medications known to make me feel better on hand for a comfort factor even if I don‚Äôt need them (Imodium, antacid, etc and I bring a bottle of water so I can take them without waiting for the drink cart) I keep very sour candy on hand as a physical distraction. I keep a list of helpful sayings/quotes on my phone, I have an anxiety playlist, I have funny photos/memes saved on my phone for distraction sans internet, though a lot of planes now offer wifi. I just do EVERYTHING. I use the ring, if that stops working I switch to the candy while listening to music, if I‚Äôm too worked up to meditate I move on to something else. Sometimes the activity will last 30 seconds sometimes 30 minutes. I switch and swap between whatever I think is working. I also get out of my seat and visit the bathroom, not frequently enough to look suspicious, but more than once. The change in scenery, if you will, physical movement, the change of lighting and temp help. I, on more than one occasion have just outright told the air hostess that I have extreme flying anxiety, this has always been replied to with ‚Äúawe you poor thing, if you need anything let us know‚Äù.

I, not an Australian, was wondering why there was a swear word in our kids book. My Aussie partner saw nothing wrong with it and said it wasn‚Äôt a swear word. Now, I swear like a sailor, but not in front of the kids. Damn is obviously on the low end of the offensive scale as far as swear words go but it‚Äôs not exactly a word I want my 6 or 3 year old going around saying at school."
australia,fcvua8j,t1_fcvcdyp,1578010255.0,"Try Filipino grocery stores for the graham crackers, they are M.Y. San brand and they come in a plastic tub usually. I know for sure USA foods sell Cactus Cooler and Jones, I‚Äôve seen them in their store before. Funnily enough I had never heard of or had cactus cooler until I moved to Australia. 

I know it‚Äôs harder to find stuff in Perth sometimes. Our Woolies are actually stocking Bush‚Äôs baked beans now along with all the Hershey‚Äôs syrups and sauces they have had for awhile and Arizona tea. Coles has brought in Stubbs bbq sauce, A1 sauce, sweet baby rays sauces, graham cracker pie crusts, key lime pie mix, cobbler mix, jambalaya mix, dirty rice, marshmallow fluff, etc. I wonder if you order online if they would get it to your local store?"
australia,fcvbkpu,t1_fcv7a9r,1577998669.0,"(Hello fellow expat! Great list!)I‚Äôll add: grape flavoured stuff and Baja blast mt dew (you can usually find the red and blue ones here if you look hard enough but no other flavours) 

Pop tarts, bbq sauce, movie Theater box candy, rootbeer, Arizona tea, Reese stuff and Hershey stuff can be pretty easily found at candy stores/grocery stores in the international section. And you can find plain graham crackers at Asian grocery stores.

I‚Äôd give a limb for a regular shipment of velveeta, grape jelly and Baja but it all varies on what kind of stuff your friend likes. Some people get really excited over brands I‚Äôve never heard of because they are local to their home state."

I was hoping to see how close it was to the Hume Hwy. We are thinking of cancelling and finding something to do here with the kids instead."
