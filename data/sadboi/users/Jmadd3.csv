[short] word of month and letters

There are several factors that come into play when looking for an individual in the ancient world. (1) location (2) distance traveled (3) linguistic (4) the typical Roman city structure 

(1) depending on where the location is would determine how an individual would be found. The typical city was around 10,000 people in the ancient Mediterranean world. So it would be relatively easier to track someone down by word of mouth than it would be today. The exception would be the city of Rome or Jerusalem where it had a much larger population. Cities like those would have been the exception.

(2) the ancient world was a much slower time than the world that we live in today. So traveling was a great commitment to the point that anyone had to make sure that their plans were near 100% ready. And, of course, the longer the distance meant a greater amount of money spent.

(3) linguistically, it was much stranger then than it was now. The Lingua Franca of the time was Koine Greek, Latin was a more administrative language that was used in the courts. So if an individual wanted to find someone in a particular area they would have to make sure that they would speak the native language. Or they would hope that a there was a large enough population that spoke Greek.

(4) this is probably the most important reason. Was how the typical Greco-Roman city was structured which led to many avenues to find an individual. The social areas were the forum and the bath houses. Another was called the Collegia (this is where we get the word college) and think of it as a worker’s union. As in Paul’s case he would go the the tent making collegia and set up a base with other workers in order to get his footing in the city"
