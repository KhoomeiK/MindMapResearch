IT'S YOUR responsibility as a dog owner to control your dog. For example my dog gets excited and will lunge at other dogs and humans to play you can clearly see she's doing it out of excitement and she's 9 pounds so not much of a risk to anyone but when I take her for walks and I see people walk by us especially if they have other dogs I take her off to the side and let them pass because I know that while my dog is doing it to play their dog may not see it that way and could become aggressive.

AskReddit,fqg7tsc,t3_giqqr8,1589339835.0,"I was pro life. Hard pro life till I was about 15 or 16 when my sister's best friend was raped by her kids dad who had just gotten out of prison.  He forced his way into her house, got the address from one of her kids family members. She loved her daughter but she didn't want another reminder of him especially of a moment that was so traumatic. Ever since I've been firmly pro choice for any occasion."
Paranormal,fqg4z86,t3_gibs00,1589338089.0,"Reincarnation is not ""universal law"" there's no hard evidence but there is belief in it and if you  think about it from either stand point scientifically or spiritually it can make sense. Souls never really die do they? They are eternal even if the body is not so why couldn't your soul seek another body to attach to? Especially with someone it would be familiar to in this case your uncles soul sought you because of familial relationship. Scientifically we're all made of matter and matter doesn't die either your matter could very well be ""recycled"" and it could be a coincidence that it just happened to be you that got his ""matter"" or what have you. Even if you don't believe in reincarnation which is fair that's still a huge coincidence maybe your uncle is trying to talk to you from beyond? Maybe you have these dreams because your mom has talked about these before and you just don't remember it? There could be many explanations both paranormal and non paranormal but reincarnation is a good possibility imo"
relationship_advice,fqg3059,t3_gi9vko,1589336893.0,"My sister had three kids with endometriosis and only one pregnancy was hard for her (the girl btw pregnancies with girls are hard for our family). I was diagnosed with PCOS at 14 and had the same reaction. My other sister also happened to get pregnant when I was 16 and I hated her for it. Looking back now my family really focused on all the ways I could STILL be a mom (adoption, IVF, foster care ) but never focused on all the ways I could lead a fulfilling life never having kids because you don't have to have kids to have a fulfilling life. Right now she probably won't want to hear it but maybe it would help to not hear of all the ways she can be a mom but all the ways her life will be fulfilling if she never becomes a mom."
AmItheAsshole,fqg08ab,t3_gie7jj,1589335236.0,"NTA. I mean has she ever heard of asking before going over even if it was just a necklace a quick ""Hey I think I left my necklace over there can I get it when you're not home"" and also why is you're possible kinks any of her business."
pics,fqfyset,t1_fqfvqb8,1589334401.0,"Wow great point. ""Just because you have guns doesn't mean you have the right to terrorize people with  them"". I think that's kind of makes a point in a way, since Ahmaud was killed by two men who were using their guns to scare him."

 It probably is stress plus all the water because I'm not using a face cleanser that would be harmful for my eczema."
MurderedByWords,fpvjlrw,t1_fpuud8d,1588946105.0,"I said ""we fucked up with the 2016 election"" I didn't point fingers at any party in particular. I absolutely agree. Bernie would've been so good for this country and for the first time on forever I felt like if he was the front runner it wouldn't have been ""lesser of two evils"" because all Bernie wanted to do was help us all. He was robbed then and now."
MurderedByWords,fpute3y,t1_fpus6ft,1588923062.0,"Bombings honestly I don't know I'm sure under him bombings happened as they do under every president. Doesn't excuse it and just because I feel like Obama was 100x a better president then what we have now doesn't mean I agree with everything he did. Politics is and always will be the ""lesser of two evils"" although we really fucked up in 2016. He touched the lives of many and actually cared about his civilians. He did improve lives in my opinion and the bills he tried to pass that would've helped more people especially veterans were always kicked out by the Republicans. So yeah he was a great president who definitely tried harder then any president I've been around for, that was handed an already shitty country, economy, and war that all happened to also be on fire at the same time with flame from hades and everyone expected him to work magic on it. He accomplished many amazing things though you should definitely look them up."

Gosh, President Obama served 8 whole years and did them with grace and integrity. Sure do miss having an adult as president."
