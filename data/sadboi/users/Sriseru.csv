â€œThe goal of your organization was restoration. Of the old world, but America most of all. You united the resistance. Overthrew the Elders. You know the rest. And rather than exterminate us, you decided to spare us. Liberate us.

""America was a country of liberty. A meeting of immigrants. Instead of simply assimilating, its citizens lived alongside others. Their roots were varied. Diverse. America was never made up of just one people.

And to then be forced to thank those who destroyed it. Not yet. I do. Do you still not know who I am? Allow me to refresh your memory.

â€œI was born in a network of caves. I was still a child when we were attacked by soldiers. Human soldiers. We tried to protect our home - our families. I watched as they massacred my mothers and sisters. I watched as you killed them. I only managed to escape because you thought I was dead. I roamed aimlessly for a long time. I was forced to adapt and change to survive. My thoughts, personality, how I saw right and wrong... War changed me - and not only my visage. My world - my truth was stolen from me. And so was my past. All that's left is the future. And mine is revenge. On you. On the Commander. On XCOM. You intend to restore the old world. To restore liberty. But I hold you responsible for killing my freedom. Killing all traces of my past... Killing any promise of a future... XCOM plans to restore the old world. You think you can.

""I will exterminate XCOM. With this, I'll rid the world of your infestation. All will breathe free again - reclaim their past, present, and future. This is no weapon. It is a 'liberator,' to free the world from XCOM. Let the world be. Sans XCOM, the world will be torn asunder. And then, it shall be free. People will suffer, of course - a phantom pain. The world will need a new hand to guide it. A language of dragons. My Lindworm shall be the thread by which all countries are bound together, in equality. Every sapient being will be forced to recognize her neighbor. People will swallow their pain. They will link lost hands. And the world will become one.
