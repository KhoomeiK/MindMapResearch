TooAfraidToAsk,fois5zv,t3_g5e0a9,1587795277.0,"Leftists will mock you and shame you for having even the slightest limelight over trump, Republicans will share knowledge and pray you see the your way in. My own mother basically has disowned me and calls me a trump supporter for mearly stating the fact that the media and leftist parties are digging up whatever they can on the president. Which is true. Use your ears and eyes to distinguish what's genuine or not. Look at all the other presidential candidates standing up there for shit you can clearly see they dont believe in. LGBT? Like hell any Democrat cares, but they'll say they do. They all make me cringe. It's obvious trump has no strings attatched to him, and sure hes said a lot of crazy shit and breaks formalities constantly. But to me, that's how an individual should act. That's how I act. Many policies are shit and were created from finger pointing bastards like the left. Trump is genuinely, hardboiled, cocky, but he's far from arrogant. Besides all this, he stands for america and honestly wants to see us become a rich country.
In recent events, trump appearantly told a bunch of people to drink bleach and lysol. That's a fake, far grab. Also recent events. Trump told our military to open fire towards any Iranians ships that threaten us again. Right now, divided as we are, it makes us look week, stupid, and overall it makes us vulnerable. Wether or not people hate trump or like him, we should respect our president until we have reasons otherwise, and then immediate action would obviously take action. 

Did you see the seminar they held to impeach trump? When the judge asked for anyone in the room to pull up a dispute against him they all went silent. Nobody could throw an impeachable offense in his face, yet the Democrats said theyd do it and they acted like they had proof.

Rhe only reason the left has any votes is because they slander around idealogies surrounding the LGBT community, black power, gay right, carbon gasses, ect. Yet none of them show a realistic plan on how to fix things. All they do is agree with your problems, which seems to work for radicalists.

Just pay attention to peoples level of genuinity. Remember back in elementary school when a kid would fuck up, and to beat the potential harm of embarrassment theyd throw some other kid under the bus as a distraction? Or even after the kid gets caught, they'll throw another kids name into the mix just so they're not the only one in trouble? That's the democratic party for you in a nutshell lmao"

But you see, i also care about myself to the point of PTSD syndrome that I only get with sex because Im super afraid of STD's. (I had a tramatic experience when losing my virginity at 15) 
So last night i had this dream that fucked with my head pretty hard. There was this girl in a hotel I was staying at. The room was super long and bedrooms were all linked together with no walls. There was even an indoor park, easy to get lost in there and easy to start convos with just about everyone. Long story short one of the girls came out of this bathroom and proceeded to walk by me, after i cracked a good joke she laughed and stayed with me for a while. Not long into it she tried seducing me. Eventually things got pretty physical, however I had friends sitting next to me as she pulled out my penis, they even awkwardly saw it. I told her we can't do it right here and i mentioned the bathroom as a good location. She agreed but then i also mentioned using a condom and that's when she got extremely frustrated, yet still agreed after throwing the condom at me and mentioning how uncomfortable they are. What happaned next was fuzzy but i remember her saying its ""just sex"" no love or relationship which i also agreed was fine but then felt this urge to turn her down for my safety (this is a post PTSD moment fyi). At the point i refused she started begging for it saying please please, my friend even turned to me and was like ""dude... this girl is gonna love you man, she gets turned down a lot."" Thats where i started feeling kind of bad for her, I did this awkward laughing while crying thing and still couldn't agree to proceed. After she finally left i felt relieved. I woke up with many mixed emotions

These days i just recently became single and i started the job ive been wanting for a while, but what I see out there while driving my taxi has me concerned on wether or not ill ever be able to have sex comfortablely, or find love. Im 30 now and used 4 of my good years with my ex. I have been dealing with stress lately that has started taking on physical transformations and is starting to affect my health, which i started battling about a month ago. However in this last month I feel like things have been getting worse and more physicalities are being dumped on me, and i feel my chances at finding love or a decent sex life is becoming worse. However, with how many people i talk to on a daily, and how many of them actually like me, it iust feels so contradictory, people open up to me 8 times out 10 and both girls and women give me a lot of looks that are quite obvious on the sexual plain, but this town i live in is scary and rampant with disease, and all the good looking guys are fucking everything with legs and going back and forwarth between the really cute ones and the monstrosities. Im just not sure how to proceed with really ""going for it"" with my health the way it is and the fear of STD's being spread throughout my town, and how everyone is so careless with the fact. Im waiting for a sweet, kind girl who still loves the smell of flowers but also still knows how to seduce a man. Half the time when i meet a girl who is seemingly kind to me, shes either with a dude who is friend zoned and i hate doing that in front of them, or i fear she has a babies daddy or i feel as if she's way out of my league.
I feel like looks mean a lot more these days than personality because there should be no reason why i have such struggles, hands down, its very rare to find a person as empathitic, as intelligen, as deep/philosophical or eccentric as i am. Thatbbeing said, If it wasn't for being a 6 out 10 or my PTSD thing, i know without a doubt id have the girl of my dreams or many. My sex life is so limited which sucks because its what ive always wanted since i started masterbating 17 years ago.
Sometimes i feel like i should have been better at changing so i could have stayed with my ex, but her smile was gone long before i broke up with her because i did nothing but dissapoint her expectations. I was the moon, and she was the sun, i only could wish we could have cooexisted, but she wanted and needed so much more and tried to pull me into her ways so desperately, which only made things worse. My sex is great, but its not as often as most women prefer, but where she went wrong with me, was getting angry when i couldn't perform. After a while any touch, kiss, or ""i love you"" felt like nothing more than a sexual advancement when at times i just wanted her to be more of a friend. Everything she did was for her mojo and never once cared about what it takes to be respectful. I see this in a lot of girls nowadays when they talk about ex's and guys they ""low key fucked with"" and how they were such a ""bitch."" This and that
I see so much selfishness in both genders when i hear guys talking about fucking everything and how it's best to just ""stick it in"" and its driving me insane. I was born into a bad era for the person that i am."

I have a hard time controlling my impulses so this has happaned quite a few times in my life. 
What is nice, is when i find a partner (usually short term) who i can feel comfortable exploring with without worry. Its not often, and sometimes a bigger form of regret hits me if i feel like i should have seen a doctor before giving them the leizure of exploring myself. Its equally scary for me to share something i think i have. 
Basically, if you guys are healthy i don't see any real reasons to be depressed. I guess maybe if we're ugly and loved ones within our circle has passed away. My mom was just diagnosed with lung cancer and thats a whole new form of depression i am facing along with my other perils in life. Im afraid of what life is gonna be like when she's gone.

depression,ert33ec,t1_ert1mga,1561231120.0,"I know this comment is way too long, but to me, its not even close to enough. In fact, what some of us are going through is more than just a problem that needs fixed, its more than a simple depression that can be cured, most the time, what we're going through is a full fucken story that needs to be heard and shared because ""change"" is the very thing people like us need. We are the weak/fragile pillars to scociety, however that doesnt make us any less important. We add value to humanity and i think people like us should become teachers. 

I wany to start by saying thank you to your kindness, my name is Alex and im 30 years of age, as of last may. And you have it right btw, and that i know that positive train of thought 100% i even preach it! However i feel like most the things we tell a person with depression is to help those with a normal case of depression, the unexplainable kind that comes from nowhere. But like i said, im a storynot an illness, I still enjoy things, i can emmerse myself in any given moment and i do it all the time, in fact most people envy me for being so outgoing and i guess, ballsy. However, beneath that, there's a lot of things that haunt me which are so hard to share which i can explain. Right now though it's becoming hard to sleep or to be alone, sometimes its okay, but sometimes its not. I'll get cold sweats, panic attacks, heart racing action and turbulent thoughts while just trying shut my eyes. I used to be like this long ago because i believed I was sick then. Now i think im going through that again. Though this time im not gonna wait 7 years to see a doctor. So, i am a little excited, but also super scared. I really hope the doctor can rid me of this anxiety. And thank you so much for the love, i really do appreciate it, it seems so rare to me nowadays. Nobody feeds me food anymore, i have a shower with a 5 gallon water heater attached to broken pipes, a yard i cant maintain, stomach issues, back pain, slight hair loss, i'm ugly but not ugly enough to give up, i am germaphobic and last but not least my mom was diagnosed with cancer, which is kind of why lonliness is becoming such a big problem because i know that im gonna have to deal with it in a way ive never dealt with before. I apologize for the venting but I can only do it here because if i do it on facebook, it'll feel like im reaching which i can never see myself doing, which also reflects my judgmental self, i am somewhat judgmental. Its very situational. And thats why its hard to share. And nobody has seen that side of me, its very tough to break character.

Check this out though! my next step after the Dr. visit is to improve my quality of living. It won't be easy because i need money for the water heater and my mother's yard! however! I just got the job ive waited a whole year to have, so it shouldn't be this hard to find the light, lets hope my money can catch up to me and maybe, just maybe, help me out for once. Im actually hoping to get rich enough to help everyone so lets cross our fingers. 
I feel like a lot of my depression is caused by outside influences AKA scociety. Even my physical health is related to someone sharing it with me. And besides the accidents, we have so many assholes out there who bring harm to people intentionally, and these people will boast and gain acknowledgment for the half hearted shit they do. I feel like there are so many people out there pretending to be someone like me, which makes me feel really misplaced, missjudged and also incredibly irrelevant, and that adds to my fleeting thoughts of ""reaching.""
I want the true colors of this world to show, i want MY true colors to show, instead they're mininalized/deminished by an overwhelming swarm of competitors fighting over whos more sad or whos more generous. I wish i could make better sense of this for you guys, but human words are frail and i cant get this out! One day I think I'll do a facrbook post. I wanna know if theres anyone out there who can resignate with me, feel my words and inevitably fall in love with me. The daunting part is what if. What if nobody tries? Wouldn't that teeter me over the edge a little?"
OnePiece,ersvbec,t1_erssnkr,1561225149.0,"Too me it looked like they all left her there. Like they were kind of planning it anyways. Also mother caramel literally had the WG posted up to sell her to them. I just finally accepted it since everyone was saying it, i guess lin lin ate them all lol"
depression,erssnuv,t3_c3ot37,1561223133.0,"Someone like me needs to know if theres still hope in which there is reason in taking care of myself. Im gonna go see a doctor on the 25th which is my first step into what hopfully will be, a healing process. There's still the normal hurdles of my depression, like lonliness and anxiety. It will either go two ways; 1, i find out im sick and hopfully the clerity alone will stop the pain in my heart, the longing. 
2. Im not sick and i can actually try to go for the things i long for. Which will naturally increase my overall health. 

If i believed in god id be asking for prayers right now."

todayilearned,erqnv62,t3_c3b35q,1561147787.0,This only makes people regret stealing the tree though.... what a pointless strategy. Also a waste of manpower.
OnePiece,erotlto,t1_eropbq9,1561088375.0,He hasn't gone that far yet lol
OnePiece,erocyd5,t1_eroa9po,1561075625.0,I like that ine better lol
OnePiece,ero8tgd,t1_ernzvdk,1561071555.0,The only thing that sucks about this theory is that we already would have been shown
OnePiece,ernnz62,t1_ernjbta,1561057025.0,I like to think that maybe some of the genes awaken but i still have doubts like you do
OnePiece,ernntd8,t3_c2ub0i,1561056915.0,All of them before the return to sabaoti. TOEI took a very unnatractive turn after the two year time skip. But id say every piece of it is worth it prior
OnePiece,ernnnca,t3_c2vh0l,1561056805.0,Its gotta be BB. My guess is first the strawhats and the BB purates will cause the WG to crumble and then it will be luffy fighting BB over ideals
OnePiece,ernni5m,t3_c2vkja,1561056708.0,"My friend did this but not for katakuri and his donuts, rather he copied zoro, like 10 years ago he started drinking a lot lol before that i never seen One Piece and when i started watching, i finally understood why he was acting that certain way. He even pretended to get lost all the time. Also he took the shows form of abuse to an extreme level, he'd slap and yell at people like it was okay lol i hope he finds this thread and reads it.

- he is still that way, its been iver 13 years now"
OnePiece,ernilfw,t1_erndd17,1561053450.0,"It kind of did, like, sanji may not have gained the powers his ciblings did but he may have gained some, or maybe it took longer for sanji's super powers to awaken, however still less prominent than his ciblings, maybe some of his powers are still dormant?"
OnePiece,ernh8ow,t3_c2htav,1561052600.0,I still havent wayched then but im current with the manga and i watched the anine about 2 in a half times before reading the manga lol
OnePiece,ermky9n,t1_ermi9nw,1561028039.0,"Dude, what if that ninja you wish to see, starts a gag where he's so attractive that he even captures the eyes of nami and Robin xD sanji and brook would be so jealous lol"

Its hard to feel kike a winner in any break up, especially the cheating kind. Especially if the one who cheated remains cold hearted and unfazed"
tifu,erm1079,t3_c2hg5s,1561002539.0,"You need to call someone to come over and grab them, someone they will never meet again. Someone you know who won't mind the emberassment. Hopefully im not too late

Edit - aaaaaannnd im too late . Lol hopefully you grabbed them without ahyone noticing xD"
Rateme,erjea3p,t3_c297ou,1560925549.0,Fuck yeah lol
AskReddit,erje80p,t1_erixrze,1560925479.0,Which is sort of ironic if the narcissist is indeed sad/depressed.
OnePiece,erjbfpd,t1_erja4yt,1560922246.0,"Ibsee where you're coming from and yes robin already does know anout pluton and of course shed be like well, damn this ship kind of resembles it. But wait, did she see the blueprint?"

depression,eridopf,t3_c23tin,1560895135.0,"Where do you live? If we're both feeling the same way there's no reason why we shouldn't get to know each other, maybe we can team up and make a bigger life for ourselves. I would love anyone else to join because i can't do this on my own. I bet half of us would be happier in a community filled with like minded people. Its people like us who make up the more fragile yet essential pillars to humanity and we should never forget that. People like us will keep humanity from infringing on other habitats, cultures or alien races if we ever get there. People like us ""care"" which puts us in a hard place."
Showerthoughts,eridbp3,t1_erh7k1q,1560894896.0,"Yup, i saw a study that looked into their nasal cavities. Not only that, but the wider the space, which should be typical in a larger dinosaur would reverberate deeper sounds."
OnePiece,erhetrf,t1_erhe1x4,1560873771.0,Are you trolling me?
OnePiece,erhet71,t1_erhe1x4,1560873761.0,"But wait. Like, tom literally did tell iceberg not to hate franky for his weapnized builds. And that franky is not the reason they hurt people. Iceberg didn't forgive franky for a long time, but i feel like helping with the sunny was his way of forgiving him. And yeah, the thousand sunny has a massive cannon on it. And iceberg did help and did see the blueprints and the canon is there."
OnePiece,erhctg4,t1_erhcbzm,1560872519.0,What do you mean? It literally already did happen. Ice berg helped franky build the thousand sunny. Does it not have a weapon on board? Lol didn't think of that did yuh? ;)
OnePiece,erh21du,t1_erescyb,1560865082.0,I just read that rubber deteriorates faster if left unused
OnePiece,erh1t54,t3_c1o7ps,1560864901.0,I just read on the interweb that rubber last longer the more you use it. And if rubber sits too long it becomes prone to oxidization and rot.
OnePiece,erh1g52,t1_erescyb,1560864612.0,Yeah but already being rubber gives him a huge boost towards immorality.
OnePiece,erh1cq2,t3_c1o7ps,1560864536.0,Isnt it weird that Luffy is like the reincarnation of roger even though ace is literally his son? Im trying to make a good plot twist using this fact.
