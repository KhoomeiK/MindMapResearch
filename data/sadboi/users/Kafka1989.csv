suspiciouslyspecific,fqiner4,t3_giyznc,1589398323.0,"As someone with ADHD (diagnosed) as well as anxiety, this shit doesn‚Äôt fly. I get that there‚Äôs things that help with the pent up energy or whatever it is. I shake my foot as well but I make sure to do it in a way that won‚Äôt disturb others. Ie: cross your legs so your foot is on top of the other, now you can shake it without bothering anyone.  I CANNOT focus when someone is shaking my seat or tapping loudly . My mind cannot stop only thinking of that .There‚Äôs things that you can do so you don‚Äôt affect those around you, having ADHD is not an excuse to be inconsiderate"
