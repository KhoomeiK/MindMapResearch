Factory farming contributes and effects our planet on a very large scale. Unfortunately our species is extremely efficient at killing but as we move closer to a vegan world we will have technology that will help us from killing the smaller (and to me) the lesser objectively significant life forms you seem concerned about. 

We know the damage that is being done now. 200 million animals are killed every day. That comes up too around 72 billion a year. Which again has a larger negative impact on our plant when you look at the emissions caused by it. I urge you too look more into this issue , you have the power to help.
