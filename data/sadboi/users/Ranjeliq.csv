1. Your armor piece is meh, some life, some res, but it could be better.
1. Ring 1 gives you int and life, and that's it. Base is useless for you, energy shield/light radius is useless, too. Accuracy rating doesn't do much, either. 
1. Ring 2 gives you a lot of chaos and lightning resistances, which is good, but I think that you better focus on getting elemental resistances from the rings, rather than chaos. That way you can fit such uniques as [[Abyssus]]/[[Bronn's Lithe]]/[[Devoto's Devotion]]/[[Carcass Jack]]/[[Belly of the Beast]].
1. Flasks. You need anti-curse, anti-bleed and anti-freeze flasks. You have only anti-bleed right now.
1. Gems. Maybe you should try setting up Vulnerability-Blasphemy-Pride-Enlighten instead of Flesh and Stone-Blood and Sand-Dread Banner and Herald. You can fit Dread banner, too, but it will be a bit uncomfortable, unless you will manage to reduce Cyclone's manacost.

Yes, it sounds very much like anorexia.

Don't be afraid to add a little bit more food to your diet, I don't know your current weight/caloric intake, and I'm not a doctor, so I won't recommend any numbers, but from your description - you need it.

First of all, extra bit of calories (of course, not unlimited amount) won't make you obese again. Probably, you will just reach healthy weight, your situation with dizziness and tiredness will improve a bit, your hair will start growing back.

Second, if you want to be muscular, you need to workout and eat at a surplus, otherwise you'll see little to no progress.

I understand your concern about the symptoms, and I know that sometimes doctors tend to blame all the problems on the weight of the patient, but you do have an issue. Even if your symptoms are not related to your weight (which I doubt), it's better to not make it worse by ignoring it.

Try to gradually improve your diet and ditch appetite suppressants and then see if your conditions will improve.

>I don't want that stigma attached to me

You don't need to tell that you are/were anorexic (besides the doctors, of course). No one should stick their noses into your life without your approval. No one should blame you for your illness. Would you blame someone with a cold?

Try to reach psychologist/psychiatrist with your concerns. Don't be afraid of the stigma. I know, I was, and I regret it now because I could feel so much better and not be miserable for so long.

Because even though those people wish better for the game, they don't know all the plans for future changes and the direction the game wants to take.

Is it, really?

Maybe, for someone who is an active LoL player, but from the outsider (read as: DotA player) perspective, who wanted to give autochess a try and picked TFT - not really. I don't know how it is right now, but I tried to play it at the beginning, and it was fun, but:

1. You can give a hero several items and they can be mixed by the LoL's recipe - as if it wasn't enough that I didn't have any idea what all those items doing and then this. Also, I couldn't find how to unequip them (might be my problem, though).

2. That weird weel of heroes after some rounds, when you shoud pick 1 hero from the carousel - I don't know any of them enough to be able to choose.

3. I might remember it wrong, but heroes had all the abilities they have in LoL, when in Underlords heroes had 1-2 abilities (early Underlords didn't have full description for them, though).

It's great if TFT changed those points somehow, to be more beginner-friendly, but I left it slightly confused.

I know that my opinion is heavily biased towards DotA, but if I felt that way, I don't know how would comlete outsider feel."

Also,  at the same time he believes that women should focus on having and raising children and don't work. So, essentially (according to his thought process) only 50% of population will be focused on generating new ideas to get us out of this hole.

I don't think very high of him."

""But niantic needs to make money"" - of course they do, and I perfectly understand that. But they can do it multiple ways: cosmetics, for example. Why can't I make my character like I can in PokeGo and buy different clothes? It doesn't affect gameplay in any imaginable way and brings them money. Win-win, isn't it?  I drop some money on cosmetics in every game I play, be it Dota, Guild Wars 2, PoE, Warframe or PokeGo, I like to customize my characters and I know that there are many people feeling the same. Why don't pick this path? Why pick something that makes gameplay so restrictive and frustrating and reeks of cash grab?"
harrypotterwu,es35nn6,t1_es32aba,1561554212.0,"Yes, but there is a difference, too. In PokeGo you can increase either you pokemon storage or item storage. A +50 increase for 200 coins. Fair enough. Have too much of some item but want to have more of another? Great, let's delete useless stuff to collect what we need. 

In HPWU you have 4 different types of storage that you need to upgrade for roughly the same amount of coins (3x for 150 and 1x for 200) which will yield you a minuscule amount of non-interchangeable space in your pockets. 

150 coins for +10 energy capacity or 200 coins for +50 whatever you want capacity. I know what I would pick up."
