LegendsOfRuneterra,fp01vxb,t1_fp01gh7,1588200928.0,"The game comes with 3 decks so you could use one of those.  When I started I just spent 50 bucks and crafted a lot of decks, so I guess you could do that too.

You get as much experience from losing a match against a player as you do for winning one against AI, so even worst case that your starter decks are never winning, you will still progress and earn rewards."

LegendsOfRuneterra,fozf2t8,t3_gag2z4,1588189586.0,"The main thing is that there is a vault that opens once a week.  You charge up your vault and you want to get it to 10+ before Tuesday when it opens.

The other thing is that for new players there is a daily reward for logging on.  So log on every day for the next week to claim your reward.  The end of the week gives a full deck with 2x ashe in it, which will be nice.

The other thing is that there is a region XP reward track under rewards.  You activate a region and unlock milestones to get rewards.  I read that it's best to level each region to 4 then level each region to 8 etc to maximize the number of cards you get.  Of course, if you know the deck you want to build, maybe it's better to just max that region first to get as many cards as possible.

The other thing is that there is a daily quest.  It's worth 1000 xp or 1500 xp depending on the quest.  You can reroll quests and you can have up to 3 at a time, so optimally you would reroll 1000 xp quests and not play a 1000xp quest unless you have all 3 quest slots filled and need to empty a slot for tomorrow."

One bit a two-year-old in the face and the other shredded my friend's shoe and made him climb over a fence to get away.  Dogs are vicious killing machines in their own minds, even those tiny toy breeds.  And they are scared of stupid things like kids and tall males that enter their territory and the only thing they know how to do when they are scared is attack.  The fact that dogs chase cars shows how nonsensically aggressive they are.  And that fact appealed to our ancestors when they were choosing a pet.  They didn't pick something completely tame to domesticate like a capybara or a rabbit, they wanted a vicious animal that would selflessly defend their property while not posing a threat to the owner."
