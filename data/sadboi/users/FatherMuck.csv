maleinfertility,fg7w5jr,t1_fg4q0az,1580602995.0,"I really can't comment, because everyone's psychedelic experience is different. 


My main advice is to treat psychedelics with the utmost respect; they shouldn't be taken lightly and there are risks. Do a little reading, Erowid is good, so is /r/psychonauts. Have a trip sitter if you can, someone to be with you the entire time and a plan in case you have a bad trip. 



That being said, there hasn't been a time I've done psychedelics and haven't discovered something new about myself, and a large-to-epic trip will absolutely make you feel connectedness."

maleinfertility,ffog9vc,t3_etiij8,1580077312.0,"I have, I both microdose and trip.

Microdosing will give you an overall positive outlook on life, like a 20% improvement I would say.
Having a big trip will definitely help you reset your brain and perhaps have a lot of insight into your infertility and help you come to terms with it. It's very good for deep introspection. I wouldn't suggest just jumping in, they can be a lot of a new user."
