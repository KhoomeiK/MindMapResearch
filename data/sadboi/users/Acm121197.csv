therapy,fqkoddw,t3_gjby1z,1589431956.0,"There could be a lot of reasons for your reaction. Fear of commitment or abandonment, insecurity, trauma, social anxiety, loss of attraction... the list goes on. The one thing I find the most helpful when faced with confusing emotions is journaling. You know yourself better than anyone, so write about what you’re really feeling and where it might be coming from. Having clarity around it might help ease that sick feeling and throat sensation. It might even be worthwhile to communicate those feelings with your partner. Best of luck!"
therapy,fqe2e1t,t3_gid0b6,1589300636.0,"When you’re young, you have very little privacy and it’s normal for parents to think they have the right to invade it. Now that you’re older, they might be more willing to respect your privacy (depending on your age). I’ve found journaling to be very helpful, especially when I’m not seeing a therapist regularly. It gives you space to say whatever you want and reflect on it. I usually feel much better after I journal. You should hide your journal so that there’s little chance for somebody to stumble across it/read it, that way you’ll feel more comfortable being completely honest in your writing."
mentalillness,fqe0ojg,t3_gidiu6,1589299826.0,:( it sucks you’re experiencing that. I have an eating disorder and really relate to that feeling and reaction. I eventually had to delete all of my skinny photos because they were triggering me too much. Remember that it’s normal to gain weight during quarantine and mental health is a struggle for a lot of people right now. You aren’t alone.
therapy,fq9soi0,t3_ghm4sl,1589206243.0,"I’ve had DBT therapists that set strict contingencies with me and if I broke them I’d get kicked out of the program. It seems completely backwards and unethical, but the therapists were actually following the appropriate treatment guidelines and didn’t even want to discharge me. They were really good therapists and it was really upsetting to have that conversation (multiple times with different programs). They’re just trying not to reinforce unhealthy behavior, even if it means leaving you in the dark to figure it out yourself.
I’m surprised your therapist wants you to write an eight page chain analysis for this. Usually my therapists just make me fill out a chain analysis worksheet and then we talk about it together. I doubt that a paper is part of the protocol, but he might be trying to make an exception. If he sees that you really understand what led up to that behavior and know what skills to use next time there’s a trigger, he’d probably feel safer working with you again.
If this is a therapist you really trust and find helpful, I think it’s worth having another conversation about it. Maybe try asking for a chain analysis worksheet and see if it’s okay to write a one page reflection on it. I feel like he might be understanding and willing to accommodate. If not, then I personally would not write the eight page paper. I’m sorry you’re going through this and hope you find a good solution!"
depression_help,fpmqpn2,t3_gebd05,1588739245.0,"The next morning is so awful. Aside from the physical discomfit, the mental anguish (shame, regret, fear) is unbearable. I’ve been through multiple experiences where I hit my breaking point and engage in risky behavior with the willingness to die. Twice I was admitted to psych hospitals and they made me miserable enough to at least pretend to get myself together. One time I wasn’t hospitalized (even though I should have been) and it took me a couple weeks to recover from my actions. I was so afraid I had permanently damaged something in my body and hated that I wasn’t “successful”. I was so conflicted because I felt like I needed to try again, but didn’t want to risk brain damage or something. Now I’m so glad that I didn’t try again and that my attempts weren’t successful. It’s been nearly two years since then and I am so much better and happier. 

It also took me a while to label my experiences as real suicide attempts. Don’t invalidate your attempt(s) by saying it’s “half hearted”. Making that concrete decision to possibly kill yourself is the same decision that could have killed you. Please don’t put yourself at risk anymore! Talk to a professional if you can."

But there’s another part of you that wants to find the way out to a better life- that’s what you have to hold on to. I know it sounds cheesy, but it will get better with time. I just want you to know that there is still hope and you don’t have to write yourself off to suicide. Our perception of how people view us isn’t always very accurate, so don’t let that hold you down.

therapy,fpa7d5m,t3_gc7sy2,1588442299.0,"My significant other doesn’t struggle with mental illness which I find fascinating. His moods are consistent (he always rates his mood as at least 7/10 on the happiness scale), if he’s upset about something it’s about an external situation rather than an internal one and he can regulate his emotions naturally in about 20 mins, his thoughts revolve around normal daily activities like video games or memes, and he’s content with his life and looks forward to his future. He’s not perfect (he procrastinates, can be stubborn, and has body image insecurities), but none of these problems interfere with his daily routine or mood stability. He also doesn’t really understand mental illness. Like he won’t understand why I’m stuck in a negative thought spiral for hours or why I randomly get anxious.

OP, I understand why you might worry you’re making up your mental illness (I thought that for a long time), but it’s a lot harder to do than you think!  I don’t think my bf could even try to induce a panic attack, depressive episode, manic behavior, eating disorder symptoms, etc. There could be a lot of reasons you feel like you’re making up a mental illness, but tbh even faking one would be a sign of a mental illness in and of itself! But honestly a lot of people worry they’re exaggerating their behavior or faking it. When an urge or feeling comes from deep within us, it’s hard to determine whether we made it up or not. But mentally healthy people don’t struggle with these thoughts. Hope this clears things up for you!"

My bf has definitely helped me overcome many mental health struggles and I am overall happier, but thinking about his life before me makes me jealous I guess? It upsets him a lot that I struggle with these thoughts but I can’t help it. I worry that I’m inadequate. I talk to my therapist about it and journal but the bad dreams still haunt me. I’ve read that these insecurities arise from an anxious attachment we had to a caregiver early on, meaning we weren’t sure about how much love/care we would receive. It results in a positive view of others but a negative view of self. Also we rely heavily on our relationships for self-esteem. This theory made me feel better because it made me realize I wasn’t crazy!"
therapy,fp27zjk,t3_gatihl,1588256951.0,"If there’s anybody you can confide in about this, ask them to dispose of the object for you. The next time you feel the urge to self harm, try pressing your fingernail into your skin but don’t scratch it or break the skin. This will give you the sensation of pain and help you ride out that urge. Since the cuts you currently have are triggering you, I’d recommend covering them with a bandaid or clothing throughout the day. These are the steps I followed that helped me to abstain from self harm. In terms of schoolwork, I break up my assignments into smaller manageable tasks that don’t feel overwhelming then I give myself a break if I feel stressed or stuck. Make sure you’re eating and sleeping well and keeping up with a daily schedule."

I came to her to talk about an eating disorder i was developing, but instead she talked about her experience with her own eating disorder which was very invalidating and triggering. Another one of my therapists did something similar, but showed me a picture of herself at my age at her lowest weight. I was shocked and confused. I don’t know why some therapists feel the need to share their struggles instead of doing their job. It also makes me angry to think about because if I had a good first therapist, my eating disorder might not have gotten so much worse."
EatingDisorderHope,fn6o5ji,t1_fn5zyjb,1586703881.0,"For her to take it seriously, you need to repeatedly tell her it’s very serious and not okay. Tell her how much it hurts you, how it’s going to affect your future together, how you hate to see her struggling and you’re scared. Encourage her to eat and don’t fall for any of her excuses. For me, if my bf continues to treat me the same if I don’t eat and still gives me affection and tells me I’m beautiful, I’m likely to think he loves me because I’m thin. If he tells me he finds it unattractive and worrisome, then I realize my disorder is getting worse and affecting my relationship. It might be different for her because she’s fully relapsed and might see the unattractive comment as a compliment. I think it’s mostly just important that you have a serious conversation with her and ask her what’s going on and what she needs to get better. If she says she’s not going to stop then that’s when you need to get other people involved. It’s not going to get better if she’s not willing to try."

EatingDisorderHope,fn0cfi0,t3_fyg6f4,1586539388.0,"I fully agree. I hate how anorexia is so glamorized and portrayed to be the most valid/cared about eating disorder. The suffering and self-hate that accompanies other disorders has been overlooked and generalized to “lacking control.” My eating disorder started out as bulimia, but the shame I felt for the responses I got from family/friends pushed me into anorexia. They would take food away from me and if I did eat they’d ask “are you going to make yourself throw up now?” When it shifted to restriction, I got the responses I actually wanted. It’s like people started to see my struggles and actually care when I wasn’t eating enough. It’s so f***ed up. And then binge eating disorder is totally misunderstood and receives even more shameful comments from the general public. It sucks because every eating disorder comes with its own struggles, urges, and difficult feelings that aren’t acknowledged if somebody isn’t underweight. EDNOS gets the confusing mix of all of these disorders and isn’t given the attention it deserves in education. People really just don’t know how to effectively respond to eating disorders and it makes me sad. We deserve help no matter what our body size is."

At 100 lbs I felt even more fat and disgusting. It’s a very dark, cold, and sad place to end up. I’m glad your family is holding you accountable, mine is too.

My boyfriend (23) was obese at your age. He was bullied for it but he never let it get him down, he just roasted his bullies back instead. During his sophomore year of high school he decided to start cutting back on his portions, but he didn’t necessarily go on a strict diet or exercise. He lost so much weight and has been maintaining a healthy body weight for years. He’s an amazing person and his body weight did not change that. Also, I just wanted to add that anybody can be out of shape. I’m at a normal body weight but I haven’t exercised in years, and the thought of it makes me feel super anxious like you do. I get out of breath and sweaty super quickly so I just don’t do it because I hate it. Don’t attribute your weight to your worth because that is a dark place to live. You are young and there is plenty of time to work on being the person you want to be. That doesn’t necessarily mean losing weight, it could just mean going to see a therapist.

It took a few years for me to mend the gap, but pretty much I went to a lot of group therapy (DBT) and talked about how I felt even though I thought nobody would understand me. Turns out other people could relate to me and that kind of brought me back to a neutral self image.  I don’t really see myself as better or worse than anybody else on a daily basis, but there definitely are triggers that temporarily send me back into that head space.

Bulimia is a disorder that a lot of people do not understand or have empathy for.  It sucks and it’s not fair but people need to understand that it’s just as miserable and dangerous as other eating disorders.

It’s mostly about mindset.  If you’re coming into therapy every week and express a lack of willingness to keep trying or continue to say you’re feeling unable to turn things around, outpatient eventually becomes useless.  The level of care they recommend is dependent upon how much structure you need.  If your physical well-being is in critical condition they’ll send you to a hospital, and if you’re underweight but not having a lot of medical issues they’ll recommend inpatient.  If you can’t be trusted not to purge or hide food, they’ll want you in residential.

It can be any body part or appearance overall.  But pretty much it’s an intense insecurity that you perceive as being much more noticeable than it is.
therapy,fjfuuy0,t1_fjemr6r,1583300937.0,I was on it for a couple years and I think it was 40
therapy,fjeiiki,t3_fd1gip,1583272313.0,I had the same experience.  I was emotionally numb and didn’t really care about anything.  I’ve heard most people don’t like Prozac because it doesn’t help
AskReddit,fjdh3ne,t3_fcroyz,1583252644.0,I gave my dad a mug that says “world’s okayest dad” and he absolutely loves it.  I’d say he would fall in the top 50% of greatest dads.  He is very proud of his mug and fully accepts his averageness
mentalillness,fjd68hh,t3_fcrsa2,1583246607.0,"I don’t have an answer for you, but I have personal experience with the same thoughts.  A few years ago I strongly believed in the spiritual “messages” I was receiving and was in denial that it could be delusions.  I had a therapist, family members, and friends express concern for me but I dismissed it and said they just didn’t understand and continued to believe that what I was experiencing was real.  Looking back on it, I do call it delusional, only because once I switched medications I realized the absurdity in what I was trying to convince myself and others of.
I think what you’ll need to decipher is whether your thoughts are becoming maladaptive to your current environment or not.  There is definitely a place for non-delusional spirituality, but it’s hard to discern what’s appropriate for reality and what’s not.  For example, if the experiences you’re having are making you feel distant from reality or making you think that you have special insight, this may be a sign of delusion."

I think it’s also important to note that having a slip in recovery does not mean you’re destined for relapse.  Our minds often jump to that conclusion, but it doesn’t have to go that way.  You’re in charge of your journey."

therapy,fj0ejdj,t3_faswsw,1582897999.0,"I’m not a therapist but I can tell you my own story.  I’ve had depression for about 10 years and it didn’t really get better until last year, despite seeing a therapist regularly for the past 7 years.  I was in and out of residential treatment centers constantly and struggling with an eating disorder, suicidal thoughts/attempts and self harm.  I was told that I’d have to see a therapist for the rest of my life and I’ve had several therapists that had to let me go due to my lack of willingness and them not being able to help.  I was stuck for so long.  It turned around for the better when I met my current boyfriend.  He is so supportive and loving and makes me want to be the best version of myself.  Therapy strongly contributed to me being able to sustain the relationship and implement skills when having high urges.  I’m not sure if you were looking for a success story, but you got one!  I definitely thought I was a hopeless case for the longest time but here I am, in school, working, and abstaining from self-destructive behaviors."
Coldsores,fj0cas5,t1_fizv8an,1582896289.0,"Yeah I agree with the person above, it’s probably a pimple.  Glad you were able to make it work in the moment.  Try applying tea tree hydrocolloid patches!  You can get them off amazon. They work wonders for healing popped pimples.  Also try to get some hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol so that it doesn’t get infected"
psychologystudents,fiu9jla,t3_f9ryk1,1582737443.0,"Electronic interventions aren’t effective in treating eating disorders.  The only app really used in ED recovery is Recovery Record, and that is just logging meals for your dietician to check.  

I think you would find more information for your thesis if you discussed the types of therapeutic interventions used in ED treatment that are most effective.  For example, DBT, CBT, RO-DBT, and ACT are commonly used in group therapy."
mentalillness,fipfev0,t3_f8sqyo,1582605390.0,"Yeah this used to happen to me.  It would only last for a couple of minutes and happened once every couple months.

Coldsores,fi53xt9,t1_fi53k6n,1582154390.0,Don’t worry!  Wash your mouth out with hydrogen peroxide and that should get ride of a canker sore over night.  If it doesn’t and you notice it turning into a bump/blister then it’s probably a cold sore.

I think they’re mostly against overprescribing medications without enough information about the individual and the harmful consequences of institutions.  I’ve definitely had bad experiences as well as helpful ones with psychiatry and institutions.  People who have schizophrenia or delusional disorders are indeed more susceptible to falling into this belief which can be dangerous.

If it’s not material success you want, what is it?  Spirituality, health, education, friendship, etc... discover ways to thrive in those areas for your own benefit rather than for others.  They will be happy for you too!
For example, let’s say you value selflessness.  You could volunteer somewhere where you help less fortunate people.  There are many ways to be successful without material gain."
