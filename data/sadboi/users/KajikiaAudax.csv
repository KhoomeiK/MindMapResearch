That's not a serious question. I have serious questions for you, though.

Why does the CEO deserve that 30 cents from me but everyone else in the company deserves .00001 cents from me? If you're going to give me that ""The CEO adds value to the company"" line, then fine; let's pay Walmart workers a percentage of every dollar of profit that passes through their register, or better yet, a certain % of the profits of every item they put on the shelf for the consumer to buy. Let's pay every teacher in the entire USA a certain percentage of the future lifetime earnings of the kids they teach. How about emergency medicine docs unionize and demand 50% of all your lifetime earnings for them to save your life. Value added to X entity, right?

I think we should be paying the head chef of a fancy restaurant 50% of all profits, seeing as the owner 2 states away is doing zero to add value to the company. The other 50% goes to the line cooks and wait staff. They're the ones creating value, right? Ask the customers why they're there. ""Wylie Dufresne cooks here!"" Value added, right? Nobody knows who owns any of these restaurants, and nobody cares.

You would think if she thinks everything the MD degree told her is wrong, she would do the old ""throw your Vietnam war medals off the bridge"" thing.

> This is in stark contrast to someone who believes Mr ChrÃ©tien is watching despite everything telling them otherwise.

I understand what you're saying here, but there were plenty of members of her pre-existing peer group (medical doctors) who told her she was nuts, and who still tell her she's nuts. At some point she decided not to listen to them. For me that's the mystery; why turn your back on 4+ years of medical training? What was the exact moment at which she decided she had been deliberately misinformed?

Is this a case of she ""might have come back to reality"" before it got this bad, but her brand as an Ivy League trained MD basically gave her thousands of followers within days? Because you can explain her beliefs as re-enforced culturally in that way, but it doesn't explain the origin of them.

I'm so curious about her previous life history. The odd thing here in terms of personality disorders is she was already past the age of 25 when she started this quackery, right? What caused this seismic change in her personality? If memory serves the textbooks (which tend to oversimplify things) say past the age of 25 the only things that can cause a huge change in personality are a near death experience, jail, military service, or a religious experience. I feel that list is incomplete without divorce (such a complete refutation of your personality from someone you love could be problematic).

I haven't dug into her nonsense but she seems spiritually fulfilled by the idea that it's ""all in her mind"". I think she finds this empowering on a personal level, which is why I think she may have been told (in her mind) ""You're a slave to medication for your identity."" (Schizophrenia is what I'm imagining here, but I'm not nearly as educated as you, and ""when all you [I] have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail""). She seems genuinely interested in sharing this ""empowerment"" with other people.

Something tells me if we could see her results on the NEO if she took one back in med school, she would have scored extremely high on Openness and extremely low on Agreeableness. Maybe she was primed to become a quack from way back then? Who knows. 

Mental health requires years of study and training for a reason, I really don't know what to make of this person."
medicine,fosdnvd,t1_forncb7,1588028670.0,"Thanks for this. But isn't her social group fellow MD's? Or at least it was until she self-selected to leave them? I would love to know exactly when her ""epiphany"" happened when it comes to her turning into a quack (of course it may not have been one big thing, but, I wonder what got her started down this path that she's on)."
medicine,form5nk,t1_fork8pv,1588014566.0,"> She's peddling snake oil at great profit.

That does change things a bit (more toward sociopathy/narcissism because of lack of empathy, if she doesn't believ what she's saying?). She could still be delusional though and honestly think she's found some kind of a fix."
medicine,fori9li,t1_foqykg3,1588012691.0,"Easy. She has schizophrenia and was on medication during med school/residency, now she's off of it because she ""realized"" the medication was ""suppressing the truth"" or her ""inner spirit"" or some such thing.

That's my guess. For *any* MD to be denying germ theory, I mean, that person is clinically delusional."
Professors,forhycy,t1_for3gk5,1588012541.0,"Yeah, IDK about that. Personally I do all my writing in Notepad++ then paste it into word because word is such an insufferably horrible program to try and use for anything at all other than torturing terrorists."
medicine,forhr48,t3_g91zyb,1588012443.0,Has anyone thought that this doc might have paranoid schizophrenia or some other type of mental illness?
