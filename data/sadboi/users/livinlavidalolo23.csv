I fell for you when you would sneak up and pet my fuzzy boots at the bar.

We get close to something we cherish and love truly and deeply outside of ourselves and then for some reason the more fulfilling, the more the “stars align” the less and less likely it seems to be that it will actually manifest for one reason or another- at least now adays. So yeah maybe with the ticking time bombs of outward connection the noise will go down for me as well if I can just accept this is how it is- and maybe just try to enjoy the moments as they are fleeting so be it.

   especially seeking love and connection 
can be so damaging and scarce in my world - I’m biased anyways though, I’m kinda in a place where I feel a little off balance with it all- like is it too weird to be deep and truthful to most in this modern time- do most people find intensity synonymous with obsession and obsession synonymous with scary... idk. I honestly want to know lol. I try to practice radical honesty and if I’m being honest- in this world- this society- it’s kinda feels like bashing your heart against a brick wall over and over- and hoping it will stop hurting you- all the while knowing it will not - and yet if I make the choice- and yes it is a choice- I’ve thought long and hard about that one- imo- but- to take the easier path, the more accepted one- stop figuratively bashing my head against brick when there’s a pillow and a bed right next to it- just lying, looking out for myself, letting go of certain morals and beliefs place to place person to person to be accepted and fit in to whatever environment I encounter- to please the world around me so to speak instead of what is still guiding my soul- is so easy accessible- but at least in my experience-  doing so has never made me feel better about anything- in fact it makes me feel slightly worse as if I’m disassociating with myself- and turning on my inner being. When I find other people who feel similar- share similar passion for truth- for discovery of self and others and life itself in an honest way- it’s a treat. But even then I’ll admit- the second I feel that connection with anyone I instantly feel scared as well- of it’s  authenticity and of its longevity and consequences and ultimately I guess rejection and the pain that results. 

So yeah- depth and truth are cool- but baring hearts takes time and effort- and we’re all already pretty exhausted now a days. 
I’m sure it took time and effort to even read these ramblings 

I understand the allure of funny and nice and fun O.P..
I’m sorry they didn’t want you.

There’s this book- I know- it’s just a book, but it was a mutual friend of ours that passed away 4 years ago now in may. They were new friends, we were old best friends with some serious connectivity between us no matter the time spent apart. My first post on Reddit is dedicated to her if you are interested to find out more about that. But anyways I introduced her (the old friend) to Vonnegut when we were like sophomore/junior in high school- specifically slaughterhouse 5- I read it and then Re read it right after and the next day I was just so excited to share it with her cus we had this mental connection and I fucking KNEW she was gonna flip a lid for this book. And I was right, throughout the rest of her life he was her favorite author and mine as well and even as time would separate us- simple conversation about Vonnegut would start new conversation year to year- keep us together in a sense of that makes sense? When she died- her brother who I was and am still close to, gave me her copy of slaughter house five because he knew what it meant to us. Letting go of grief, or suffering, of anxiety of believing time in nonlinear and that all bad moments are just blips in time and we can let it go with something as simple as saying “so it goes” that book, well I’m sure you can imagine meant the world to me when I received it. 7-8 years before I had been handing her that very same book and it became a catalyst for her and my huge love for the author (Vonnegut) 

This girl I speak of (my person I wish was writing to me) she reached out to me about 3 years ago- we had never really talked before- she saw my poem I had written amid my grief and loneliness and she extended herself to me- with a simple but heartfelt message that broke through the walls I had thought to be impenetrable at that point- I thought my heart was gone forever when my friend died. But this girl broke through- somehow- and we spent the summer together just as friends but with an energy where everyyyyywhere we went people would ask how long have you two been together, aww your so cute you two. Etc. but I respected her and didn’t want to push just because other people saw something I was starting to kinda feel... and she had these regrets with our friend who had passed about how she passed and her feeling involved and we had discussed Vonnegut etc and I decided to let her borrow my most important book to me in the entire world.
Well three years later she still has it.
Three years later and this time instead of a long winded poem about tantric love that I sent at the end of that first summer
This time (sense we’ve weaved in and out of each other’s live kinda how you discussed above) there was dances, and arms around each other looking to stars only to get interrupted (ugh) to parking in a lot just eating rotisserie chicken talking to singing 4 non blondes with our faces as close as they could be without touching and hand holding, and fuzzy boot and coat petting- and all these physical signs of something...
And I went for it I mean 80s movie gesture style went for it- and at first it seemed like when she called she was interested- talking excitedly and non stop (just our style) telling me at the end of the convo it’s a lot to think about but we will have to hang out verryyy very soon (this is after she read my card asking her on a date and this was her response)
And then ghosted for a week
Then I text her and give her the out saying if your scared to hurt me with your feelings it’s kay, I prefer to know then to live in the gray. 
And she kinda broke me
At the point she made me feel like a fool
Saying she didn’t understand how I didn’t understand she doesn’t want me like that at all how it’s starting to get scary and even obsessive
So yeah at that point, fuck I care about her, that’s the last thing I was going for so I gave her what she was begging for and said I would leave her alone, and there was no protest from her and there was no pushing from me. Answer was given- radio silence is what she wanted to not feel weird and that’s what I would give her it wasn’t even hard to do- I just guess I care about her so much Even though it kills me it wasn’t hard to comply to her wishes because they were her wishes

But yeah the book- 
Slaughterhouse 5
She still has it- she knows what it means to me
If she wanted to sever our bridge completely wouldn’t she want to give that back? So I could have nothing legitimate to contact her back about if that’s what she desires? If I wanted to sever our bridge completely wouldn’t I have asked for it back with the radio silence? 
Maybe our friend is orchestrating something above once again with that little book that orchestrated so much between the two of us.
Honestly I never thought I’d be okay with ANYONE having that book- and having her have it- well it feels like for some reason it’s supposed to be that way for now. There’s a chapter left of our story I guess- even just if it’s in the future getting the book back- at least that’s one last time we can interact- say our pieces- feel the moment out."

UnsentLetters,fmm0txs,t1_fmki2kc,1586196694.0,"This may be the most beautifully heartbreaking post I have ever seen on reddit. I also practice cathartic writing. Sometimes it’s the only thing that can save me from drowning in the emotions and thoughts engulfing me, like you say month to month- day to day- week to week- even hour to hour sometimes they change and grow and can even make what seemed sane before seem like madness. Or vice versa. Sometimes I wish I never would have written a single word at all, actually most the time I wish I wouldn’t have, except for of course when I’m smack dab in the middle of my confusing, passion fueled rants.  What you spoke of with the grave you live in-with the dirt walls collapsing in on you and the stars being erased in the sky- but with her words whispered in your ear right before your dreams take you- and everything you’ve been avoiding by living in the grave of your choosing, the warmth, the life the hope, she whispers in your ear and you can’t help but let the warmth in- even though it makes the cold of reality that much more bitter in the adjustment phase- I feel this so much- sometime for days, sometimes for weeks, months- even years after the loss of my friend, a part of my soul torn from my essence I don’t believe to be “repairable” nor would I even want to repair on this earth in fear of losing a single memory or feeling. But then sometimes I do feel joy and it’s weird because that feels real too- and I don’t regret it after. And most people in my life say their general impression of me is light and happy and bubbly- but yet reading about the warmth of the grave the numbness being the closet thing to feeling joy- resonated with my soul so much.

Thanks for caring 🙏🏻🤟🏻 hope your safe wherever you are during this time of uncertainty through the world.

UnsentLetters,fki76c3,t3_fifd89,1584213258.0,Stay strong. This touched me
NonBinary,fkbfoa4,t1_fkau7cu,1584032144.0,Once you do find one I will be excited for you to get to do it- it’s a liberating feeling no lie
UnsentLetters,fjijty1,t3_fdkng0,1583369219.0,Just tell them how you feel- sometimes being brave for real love is essential- show them you would really go to hell and back for them by unabashedly giving them your authentic self no matter how campy- maybe if you take that first step the rest will come surprisingly easily. Wish you the best on your journey
toastme,fj8dzsd,t3_fbrtpp,1583111191.0,"I’m so sorry for your loss. You are a strong person and asking for help when you need it is the greatest sign of that so toast to you. 
Side note: you are never responsible for something like that- I don’t just say this- I have lived through believing I had responsibility for my persons loss of life to depression. It’s not what they would want honestly. They would want us to just feel loved and comforted I think at least.
Much love and keep your head up."
Vonnegut,fizmu8e,t3_fapdgu,1582867310.0,"I love this energy!!! Go you!!! There’s a collection of all of his letters and such in a book, ummmm... the magazine idea is so cool though- maybe a cities library might have the information available at least if they don’t have copies to look at at least. There’s a pretty cool podcast on sound cloud called the Vonneguys. You’ve probably heard of these or thought of these already but I figured I share anyways just in case. 
Happy hunting *"

Vonnegut,fi0qp17,t3_f5rvud,1582042821.0,Thank you 🙏
Vonnegut,fi0qk1p,t1_fi0qekk,1582042739.0,"Okay, good to note- I generally find my Vonnegut conversations going off on pretty wild and random tangents anyways- like removable taps for ya shoes” so that’s pretty cool- I like that open platform for convo 🤟🏻"
