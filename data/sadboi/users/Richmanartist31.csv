Anxiety,evdbk49,t3_cjem7k,1564434416.0,"Yes I always feel spaced out all the time, alot of times it feels like the moment isnt really happening, like a feeling of being disconnected from reality kinda like you said."

Sims4,eukzjy3,t3_cgs7ih,1563895077.0,"ya I'm pretty happy with just playing the sims as intended. I've tried mods and cc and it just seems to kinda mess things up in the game. I love the sims as it is. I feel a lot of people hate on the sims 4 so much, when I think the game is amazing, and just keeps getting better with all these great packs EA has put out so far."
