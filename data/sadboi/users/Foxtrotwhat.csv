BPD,fqy4n47,t1_fqy04lh,1589742512.0,Thanks a lot for your response. I didn't know about this chat at all.
raisedbynarcissists,fqueyiv,t3_gkzhu1,1589657715.0,"Yeah man. Abuse is fucked up bc they keep drawing you back in by appealing to your sense of empathy and humanity. I'm still in that cycle bc I live with my parents and ndad goes from being "" good guy with abandonment issues who just wants love and validation"" to ""abusive monster who traumatizes his entire family for fun"" on an almost daily basis. Right at this moment, I'm trying to recover from a random barrage of insults that made my mom cry and sent me into a mental spin that I can't quite comprehend."
mybrilliantfriendhbo,fohe0m8,t1_fmuxm7o,1587764372.0,"As background for why I disagree with this stance: I see the entire show as being woven around Lila and Lena's obsession with each other, manifesting in their constant need to one-up one another. Even the teacher, Oliviero, knew this - when Lena's high school admission is confirmed, she tells her to tell Lila that she's going, and mention she's studying Greek. Because she sees Lila's genius and motivation and knows that if Lena does something, Lila will want to do it too. And Lena is constantly afraid of Lila overshadowing her, heavily overcompensating through achievements like her academic excellence and even her first solo adventure to the beach town. 

While Lila is invested in ideas of justice and wants to experience true freedom, and Lena has her own quiet hopes and desires, in general, both of them are primarily focused on the other's position on their imaginary scoreboards. The only difference is that Lena wants Lila's love and validation, whereas Lila wants Lena to admire and follow her. 

In this episode, the comments about Pasquale and her husband, and everything being a mess, was simply her taking them down a peg, essentially saying ""your conversation is not as smart or meaningful as you think it is. It's not that I don't get it, it's *you guys* that don't get it."" Asserting her alpha position, as always. Similarly, when Lila starts reading again, she's telling Lena that she can outdo her in capturing the attention of this boy whose intellect Lena worships.   
To Lila, while Nino definitely also represents freedom, education, passion and all the other things she craves, he is (atleast at this point) primarily a competition to be won."
BPD,fo80cko,t3_g61u5j,1587587655.0,OMG YES 1000%. Been single and without anyone to fixate on for a year now and I'm at my most stable and relatively happy. I feel so in control of myself and my life. It scares me a little bc I sometimes wonder if this is an elaborate defense mechanism  my mind has created to safeguard me from the vulnerability of emotional connection...but for the most part I just enjoy it and focus on self-improvement.
DebateAVegan,flry9mu,t1_flrs4le,1585430409.0,"So you think starving an obligate carnivore is justifiable, but using a phone to chat with your friends is an absolute necessity? Sure, sounds species-neutral


Edit: realised this is debateavegan and not the vegan sub, so wanted to clarify that I'm vegan/anti-speciesist myself, so I'm not arguing for the ""moral relativity of all things"" or whatever"
DebateAVegan,flrep6l,t1_flqhpzd,1585418673.0,"But cats aren't human children, they are nonhuman animals, obligate carnivores who were forced into a situation where hunting is extremely difficult due to (surprise!) human industrialization. Ethics are almost always complex, and oversimplifying things does no favours for the actual victims of speciesism 
Tl;dr all nonhuman animals are affected by (aryanist/colonist) human supremacy in one way or another"
niceguys,fb4wte9,t3_ebhwcs,1576516878.0,Sokay I understand what you mean OP. It's *Pretentious Boy* coming to u from all across the world
TwoXChromosomes,fb4uogz,t1_fb4u7oa,1576515831.0,"Yup for sure. I think a lot of people like to pretend progressive spaces are a vacuum where real world power dynamics don't exist, but they absolutely do, and men really need to be aware of that and act accordingly - amplifying the voices of womxn and working on your own relationships with masculinity is definitely the way to go."
TwoXChromosomes,fb4tz40,t1_fb4tkxe,1576515472.0,"Ugh yes you're right! Sadly even in the *feminist circles* where I live, there's a tendency to believe and build with cis men. Wish there was a stronger sisterhood, I definitely need it."

raisedbynarcissists,f73srcm,t3_dubqan,1573394670.0,"I can speak from a  child's perspective - there has been a lot of ""cutting off"" by my parents (although not for reasons as noble as yours). I was raised with a lot of slandering of those people, and descriptions of how they are bad human beings. It negatively affected me in terms of my ability to relate to others as well as myself. I suggest you discuss the concept of boundaries with her in simple terms, and talk about how sometimes you can love someone but spending time with them can feel bad, or something along those lines. And you can talk about the traits you loved in them that you see in her, or what she got from them, as you mentioned. Introducing her to the complexities of relationships in a healthy way would benefit her in the long run."

Fleabag,f57g07d,t3_dmriet,1572035536.0,"I really felt like them falling in love without knowing much about each others' pasts was a part of it. Like she had learned to develop boundaries and go from the present with trust, almost. He did that too - when he's at her house he hears her conversation with the lawyer, but it doesn't affect him. Her entire relationship with him seemed to serve as a confirmation of all the ways she'd grown, it's portrayed in a much more mature and meaningful way than all her past hookups/relationship. Idk a better way to put it"

depression,f3ut4q3,t3_dicr8n,1571167051.0,Had severe fatigue until my vitamin D3 deficiency was addressed. Vitamin deficiencies are fairly common and significantly affect your health. Definitely have your levels checked!
AskWomen,f20kygj,t1_f20k9re,1569860887.0,"Hmm...being calm, not trying to one-up other guys or brag about stuff. Just treating me (and people in general) like a person, responding to my body language and holding conversation in a considerate and courteous way. It really just shows overall when a guy has worked on himself and is a secure, self-confident human being."

depression,f1uvq4x,t1_f1uuwd2,1569764259.0,"It's really nice that you're able to support your friend, I really hope you give medical help a try! Also check out Dr. Thema Bryant Davis and The Holistic Psychologist on social media platforms. They share a lot of useful information that has really helped me cope after stabilising on medication. Sending love 💛"
depression,f1utxke,t1_f1utegz,1569763647.0,"As painful and difficult as it is to live around people who believe your experiences aren't valid, it doesn't make them any less real. Imagine what you would say if a close friend came to you and told you that this is how they felt all the time. Wouldn't you want to support them and get them help? Be that friend to yourself. Regardless if your father or other people you know believe it, mental illness is very real, very all-consuming, just as crippling and difficult to live with as any physical illness."
depression,f1usisa,t1_f1urdqa,1569763070.0,"Perhaps your environment has made you feel like your feelings are insignificant and you expect rejection or a lack of understanding if you open up. But how you feel is always valid, and any psychiatrist worthy of that title is going to help you address them in a healthy way. Try to reach out again, and be honest this time. You can even ask to show them past written accounts if it's hard to speak in the moment. Depression is a fucking mind possessing demon and it makes you believe its lies. Don't succumb, there is a world beyond it."
depression,f1uq8ky,t3_dauri4,1569762108.0,"100% understand you, been where you are and dealing with it is a work in progress. First of all, please get to a psychiatrist and get medication sorted out. Medication is the only reason I am able to get to the point of managing my symptoms, depression without medication is a dark, inescapable hole. Once your meds stabilise, you can start thinking about ways to optimize your schedule to ensure you are not overwhelmed and get adequate rest and care. But please don't give up, as real as it feels, I promise you it's an illness playing tricks."

BPD,eyu7vu1,t3_cyu7kf,1567455185.0,"I have been in this position multiple times. What you're feeling is totally valid, esp if it's someone you had serious emotional history with. The first thing I'd suggest you do is ground yourself. Chat with some friends, force yourself to go for a show or community event, basically put things in perspective - this is just one human being and it's a big, big world. Another little thing that really helped me was following The Slumflower and actualblackmermaid on IG, they're super empowering and really help put things in perspective.
If you are too drained, allow yourself to rest, and journal. Putting your emotions down on paper can help soo much. Remember that you are not alone and you are a unique and interesting and amazing person who deserves the kind of love and affection you give to other people."
