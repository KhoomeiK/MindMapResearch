A Linux distro where you compile a minimal kernal yourself like Gentoo and build the packages for that architecture while very slow to setup and update would fly when running.

unixporn,fqd25uw,t1_fqcohuo,1589277096.0,I did a research paper on it in grad school and read the book absolute OpenBSD.  I love it.  I want it to succeed.  If I wasn't a poor college student I would donate money to the project.  It is just to me the next release seems to be the one that will fix everything and that release is always n+1 away.  I have a need to run some Microsoft tools from time to time like proprietary office or visio and not being able to do that is a deal breaker right now.  I would have to dual boot.  Right now I can run what I need to with wine in FreeBSD.  Once VMM gets better than ssh or a serial console I will probably make the leap to OpenBSD full time.  6.7 looks to be a very exciting release here in a few days and I look forward to trying it out on my main machine.
unixporn,fqcn3yo,t1_fqciw77,1589262733.0,"This person is spot on.  Don't know if I can add much.  FreeBSD is a great desktop OS.  Wine works, it has a linux emulation layer that allows Linux code to be ran at native speed, but it isn't new enough with all the api codes to run the latest steam games in the linux emulator.  CentOS 7 compatibility layer and they were coming from a CentOS 6 layer.  Minor release such as 12.1 and later this year 12.2 can't break compatibility between versions so upgrades are trivial.  Way more trivial than updating an Ubuntu release.  Packages are updated quarterly and kept separate from the base system.  In my 1 year of use have only had a packaging problem once.  FreeBSD also supports a ports system similar to Gentoo emerge (it's actually where the system comes from) that lets you compile packages custom to your system with flags and options.  FreeBSD hardware support is lacking compared to Linux but not by a ton just little stuff here and there.  On a desktop I've never had problems but wireless cards on laptops are a sore spot the project is working on.

OpenBSD is also a great OS but strickly open source.  No wine support and the Linux emulation they had was very old and was ripped out.  It is less performant than FreeBSD but supposedly more secure.  It has too very cool system calls, pledge and unveil, that depending on who you talk to are great security features.  I love OpenBSD but always feel like it is one release from being the best yet.  It is working on a project called VMM as a hypervisor and once that is able to run Linux or Windows with a gui in it as VMs the rough edges will be gone from OpenBSD.  One other problem with OpenBSD is that it doesn't have a file system like ZFS or BTRFS.  Just the traditional UFS/FFS (Unix file system/ fast file system) it is roughly equivalent to the Linux EXT4 file system.  There are rumours that OpenBSD will pull in the HAMMER2 file system from dragonflyBSD that is more like ZFS and BTRFS.

tl;dr -- FreeBSD is a great OS and loving it on my main workstation.  OpenBSD still has a few rough edges and lack of working Wine or a gui VM keep me from using it as my main OS but I can't wait till the day it can fulfill my main OS duties.  It is a great project, just a little short on manpower and money, but is like a diamond in the rough right now."

unix,fpco5fx,t3_gcp7hv,1588507665.0,"The commercial Unix products like you mentioned are well engineered. There is a famous quote about comparing Solaris internals to Linux internals and it was like night and day different. You still see Sparc 64 servers running Solaris, and power 9 servers running AIX, and Itanium servers running HP-UX. In fact many large companies run those commercial Unix products for mission critical applications. It is just they are expensive solutions. x86_64 with Linux is ""good enough"" for a vast many use cases. Around the dot com crash around 2001 people started moving away from those custom silicon processors to standard PC hardware running Linux.  Think about it a hardware software combo solution from Oracle with a Sparc64 processor and Solaris might cost you 100k. Yeah it's gonna be double redundant with hot swap everything and have almost 0 down time but can you really justify the price?  To use a metaphor my dad used on me growing up you can sell a whole lot more 5 dollar knives than 50 dollar knives even if the 50 dollar ones are superior in every way. That's basically what Linux did. It's not the best solution, heck even FreeBSD is better engineered (Linux breaks backwards compatible all the time in APIs) but it's a good enough solution for many people and use cases so is used more than the commercial Unix products."

linuxmasterrace,fp4myhj,t1_fp1zkfi,1588302591.0,I love the BSDs.  I really love OpenBSD and did some research about it and think it is a well engineered product and lurk in its subreddit a lot.  It has a few rough edges for me right now.  Namely I can't run wine in it nor a graphical VM of like Linux or Windows and run needed applications in the VM.  Once their VM gets to supporting more than ssh and serial console I may switch to it full time.  I also wish they would get a more modern file system.  FreeBSD is rock solid stable.  I've had no problems with it compared to rolling release Linux distros.  It doesn't use systemd so is not vulnerable to any exploits found in that pile of code.  Support for everything I need to do is well supported in FreeBSD with wine and virtual box letting me access a Linux VM for when I need to most stuff just working natively with wine.  So until OpenBSD gets a little more polished I will stick with FreeBSD.  That being said I do not know if I would recommend a fresh Windows convert over to FreeBSD because you are left with a shell prompt and no X windows after a full install.  You have to follow a guide to get a full desktop up and running.  ZFS support is also part of the base so I have native full disk encryption and RAID 1 on my SSDs for piece of mind.

I picked the infrastructure concentration and got to take classes in shell scripting and Perl and powershell and system administration classes about network storage and data centers and a required cyber security course.

If you even think you might need it go ahead and include it.  Yes its not the absolute minimal as it can get and not optimized but it will still boot your hardware.  Drivers is an easy section to optimize for if you have realtek network card or an intel card include all drivers for that manufacture but uncheck for other manufacturers.  Make menuconfig is your friend gives you a nice curses interface to configure everything.  Have fun!  Customizing a Linux kernel is so much easier than other operating systems.

Netflix runs servers on FreeBSD as do many NAS units, and at the same time many people run OpenBSD for high security webservers. FreeBSD is famous for it's high throughput network stack and works well with the crazy expensive 40GbE and 100GbE network cards. OpenBSD includes its own custom webserver as part of the base install. Without knowing what you intend to do with this webserver it's hard to say. How many hits do you expect per hour? What kind of hardware is it running on?  Also you have to consider time between releases and updating the OS. FreeBSD supports each major version, the 12 series release for example, for 5 whole years! Minor updates like 12.0 to 12.1 are trivial and unlikely to break anything. Packages are updated 4 times a year in general. Security updates are an exception. OpenBSD on the other hand tends to release in April and October of each year, roughly every 6 months. Each release sees 1 year of support.

WalleyeFishing,fotj6zh,t3_g91i70,1588055573.0,Very nice.  I live in Oklahoma now and my dad has caught one but I'm still searching for my first.  They aren't as plentiful as in northern lakes.
openbsd,fosozq0,t1_foquyj2,1588035080.0,No it is not optimal but better than nothing.
2007scape,foqa216,t3_g8y81c,1587988071.0,"If on Linux or BSD, basically anything using X windows. Use ""xgamma --bgamma 0.8"" have it in my runelite start up script I made to open the launcher. So easy on the eyes."
unixporn,fomrf9u,t1_fom1pdf,1587901178.0,"This spacemacs editor looks most interesting. Know a little vim, a little nano, but mostly like in Kate for school projects. Might have to seriously look into this editor. Also, beautiful setup, very well done."
2007scape,fomqmbn,t1_fomgqh4,1587900321.0,Came here to say that but at the same time I'll look at a skill and see only ten more levels till a diary requirement that's just double current XP and not realize yeah that is double my current XP!
openbsd,fomoxe9,t3_g85yqs,1587898430.0,Great news for someone like me with a low end desktop monitor with built in speakers! The day is soon coming where OpenBSD will be my daily driver. I wish I could code worth a darn to help but thankful for the amazing dev team that does so much. If only they could get paid what they are really worth!
linuxquestions,fomn3ge,t1_fom9jmy,1587896359.0,"Nothing is tricky in that case. I added a third class of operating systems that does not have good fuse support for file systems like NTFS. I haven't found a good file system for sharing between FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Windows, and Linux."
linuxquestions,fommwb7,t1_fom9rqq,1587896131.0,Yeah I was referring to sharing files between two computers via USB drive or external hard drive.
linuxquestions,fom95w4,t3_g88n8g,1587882048.0,"Linux has great support for FAT32 and NTFS even exFAT is getting better!  Now were it gets tricky is sharing files between a BSD, Linux, and Windows because then your only good option is FAT32 or ext2.  ext4 isn't well supported in read/write mode and Linux and the BSDs don't work well with each others UFS/FFS file system implementation."
openbsd,foj9bp3,t3_fzlelo,1587813476.0,It would be nice to have a cross platform file system for shuffling files between systems. Currently fat32 is best but that file system is long in the tooth so to say and doesn't support large files. Linux doesn't like ffs/ufs and from what I've learned the ffs/ufs file systems are not compatible between the *BSDs. That leaves NTFS and ExFAT both well supported on Windows and Linux but not so much on the *BSDs. Leaving us really with tar-ing to raw devices or using ext2 to move stuff between systems.
openbsd,foj8ivt,t1_foj1kz0,1587812591.0,"Absolutely beautiful. This is why I am studying IT in school. To play with, for a job, hardware like this!"
openbsd,fo8x4vq,t1_fo69ymr,1587605695.0,I got it fixed for anyone who comes across this post at a later date.  Just left off the file extension on the link.  Link is working now.
ITCareerQuestions,fo8utgu,t1_fo6f4cr,1587604298.0,"Why is Python more popular for scripting automation than Perl when that was the very purpose Perl was developed for?  Perl was meant to extend AWK and SED uses and what you could do in Bourn shells.  There is also like multiple ways to do anything in Perl versus Python only having one or two ways to do something.  Finally, I guess just personal preference but I love curly brace style languages versus white space indentation. Same thing with ending each statement with a semicolon.  That's probably cause I went to a school that taught C and C++ first though."
openbsd,fo6afwe,t1_fo66dx7,1587552572.0,I feel really bad giving you a broken link. It was working in January. My sincerest apologies.
openbsd,fo6a8pc,t1_fo69ymr,1587552368.0,[OpenBSD research paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uJoRCFAlfbH4uHgr7PwHb2cWw19cpFf3/view?usp=drivesdk)
openbsd,fo6a4ev,t1_fo69ymr,1587552242.0,It is indeed not working. I will investigate tomorrow and see why it is not working. Let me see if I can get the Google drive link to work.
unix,fo68euc,t1_fo67o4h,1587550418.0,Wow that sparc station inside is beautiful. Would love a good Sparc based server to play with Solaris on. Also you were right much larger boards that I thought. Maybe even the old AT form factor even.
unix,fo67h7p,t1_fo677rs,1587549410.0,Thanks so much for the reply. Amazing they could squeeze so much processing power into such tiny boxes even back then. Those are like itx form factor cases today.
freebsd,fo66lmi,t3_g0fhlp,1587548455.0,I use XFCE4 the latest release.  It works great on FreeBSD and Linux both.  Only issue is the file manager Thunar occasionally dumps a core file.  It is rare but often enough to notice.
openbsd,fo66dx7,t1_fo60pfv,1587548219.0,It is hosted on my personal website I use to try to get jobs: http://kylewillett.net  It is listed under OpenBSD paper near the bottom of the screen.
ITCareerQuestions,fo66b3x,t1_fo6194c,1587548135.0,"I disagree.  It is a great language, very C like.  Easy to pickup.  My Professor used it a lot when he was a system administrator.  It is one of the few cross platform scripting languages.  Works on Linux, Unices like Solaris, HP-UX, AIX, Windows, and all the *BSDs.  Python I guess you could say is also as widely portable but is not first and foremost a scripting language, it just fills in for a scripting language on occasion.  I dare say coding in Perl was the best programing expereince I ever had.  The university I go to is a top program for IT and Perl is even in the textbook and the Professor shared with us stories of using it to automate tasks on Linux and Solaris Unix boxes.

Schools still offer classes in Fortran and Cobol too.  Just because a language isn't the #1 hottest on a hot programing language chart doesn't mean it isn't important."
