Normals people shouldn't own archaeological artifacts. The truth of the matter is, however, that Roman artifacts are quite plenty in Europe.

* All civilian casualties in a civilian target
* No state of war, heightened alterness or warning
* Motivated by pure terror and hatred, arguments of self-defense (however thin) cannot be made here

This does not mean that the lives of 9/11 victims are somehow worth more than those of civilian victims of war, or those of soldiers, or those in different countries, et cetera. 

But atrocities should be viewed in different dimensions. Deaths are one very important one. But other aspects do matter to some extent. From that point of view, 9/11 was definitely unprecedented. Hiroshima and Nagasaki were much bigger tragedies, no doubt. But 9/11 occupies a somewhat different category."

TruePokemon,fqsx8d2,t3_gkrj20,1589622202.0,"Two thoughts:

First, I think the extent to which Dexit affects Sword and Shield gameplay is probably limited, and I do think gradually reintroducing Pokémon (for free) simultaneously with expansion packs (passes) is an acceptable solution. I think it's still nonsensical that Game Freak failed at the only core mechanic of their game, namely making or porting Pokemon models, but for the game it's not the end of the world - especially since Pokemon were soft-excluded in the past as well (R/S, B/W).

Second, however, is the wider controversy around the games - beyond just Dexit. Here my opinions haven't softened **at all**. At the time of release, people held up Breath of the Wild and Mario Odyssey as the examples of how to reinvent the franchises for the current era. 

In the meantime, (actually even just the past weeks), I've seen one excellent Nintendo game being published or announced after the other. Animal Crossing New Horizons is yet another example of a perfect sequel. (If you have a better example of a ""kid's game"" that is still well-designed and popular among adults, I'll wait.) Super Mario Maker 2 shows how a publisher can be generous and appreciative of their customers by releasing top-notch expansions and updates to their already amazing game **for free** many months after it was released. Pokémon instead provides an incomplete and lackluster game with €30 expansions. The new Paper Mario, Legend of Zelda Link's Awakening, Luigi's Mansion 3 show how classic games can still be relevant on the Switch, and have some of the best polish I've ever seen.

In short, all of these recent proprietary Nintendo IPs show that Nintendo and it's franchises are very capable of publishing high-quality, innovative, yet classic, polished games aimed at kids but fun for adults. There is absolutely no reason Pokemon could not have received the same treatment. It is a huge missed opportunity both for Nintendo/Game Freak/TPC and of course for the fan base."

starwarsspeculation,fqrmw97,t1_fqq6m1a,1589587595.0,"On the one hand I'm hyped because I want all these plot threads to be executed. On the other hand I'm afraid it's too much to stuff in one season.

Season 1 was very simple in its setup, actually. Not that many characters, the ones that did feature stood out and were easy to understand (gritty bounty hunter, cute baby, strong woman, selfish hustler, bad guy) and a fairly simple plot (keep the baby alive). This is one of the reasons Season 1 worked so well, it felt like old school Star Wars (which is simple as well) and there was room to breathe, with the mudhorn and the AT-ST and the New Republic ship.

Season 2 could pull of the same trick if it decides to focus on _either_ of the following three plots:

1) Finding the Yoda Planet (which will so historical in the Star Wars franchise it deserves more than just a passing in one episode, it deserves to shine, and a proper narrative arc that spans the whole season).

2) The Rebels cast hunting down the Darksaber with Mando, with Mandalore lore (ha) sprinkled throughout.

3) Exploring the connection between the Child, Kamino and Boba Fett (who also deserves and extensive narrative arc to celebrate his long awaited return).

Each of these ideas are amazing (!) but once they start to be mashed together I'm afraid it will just be a big intertextuality fest: ""Oh I know this character, and that planet, and look more Yoda's, wow what the fuck is actually happening?!""

The first live-action appearance of Ahsoka, the return of Boba Fett and the first appearance of the Yoda Planet are all so special that they shouldn't just be cameos.

Personally, I think the Ahsoka, Bo-Katan, Sabine rumours relate to Season 3. Season 2 has probably wrapped filming already (hopefully) and casting decisions at this point are a bit late. We know however that Season 3 is already in pre-production and surely casting these important characters is something they want to have done before soon as it influences the writing as well. I think Season 2 will probably have Boba Fett, but I think the whole Rebels cast will only appear in Season 3."

pokemon,fq1f3ci,t3_ggd6vl,1589045087.0,"Nintendo should release a Virtual Console app on mobile, which plays literally the entire GB-GBC-GBA library. 

Games can be browsed and downloaded in-app. Each game can be played for one hour for free. After that, to continue playing, a game needs to be purchased and costs between €1-€5. Bundles exist to make use of discounts (e.g. Pokémon bundle etc). 

The Link Cable can be simulated using a Virtual Console Friend Code. Pokémon games can connect with home just like the Virtual Console games on the 3DS. 

New Switch games can be designed to somehow connect with vintage Game Boy Virtual Console games. For example, in BotW 2, special dungeon may be unlocked only if you find one million rupees in the original Zelda or something. In the next Pokemon game, you will receive a New if you complete the Pokédex in RBY and a Celebi if you complete the GSC Pokédex, etc. No need to alter the code of the original games. The Virtual Console only need to read the save file and communicate with your Switch game. Your Virtual Console account should be synced with your Switch account, which also allows for local backups (on your Switch) of your save files in case anything happens with your phone.

Going one step further, Nintendo would simultaneously release a Virtual Console app on the Switch, which would function and look basically the same. Because the mobile and Switch apps are synced, save files are synced as well. And thus you can play on your Switch at home, or in the car, but now even on your phone whenever you don't have your Switch with you. (Problems can arise when playing offline with the switch.)

If enabled, people with your friend code can see what you are playing and propose in-app to Link up, share screenshots, respond with proprietary Nintendoji: Mario smiley, Pikachu heart face, etc..

I'm not saying Germans today shouldn't bear the weight of responsibility for their ancestors' crimes. Or that we should we stop talking about the war and Holocaust. On the contrary. I find your comparison of me with people that downplay slavery absolutely disgusting.

I'm saying that a full and honest reckoning with the evil past - a process in which everything is admitted and nothing is downplayed, and in which the guilty are punished and removed from power or from the face of the earth completely - is worthwhile, and possible. And that it makes a country stronger and better.

This is an important lesson of the 20th century. Otherwise, it's just ""let's kill or defeat evil people and leave"". As if that is enough to prevent evil from returning. (Spoiler: it's not.)

>At least america decided to end slavery on its own. Didnt have to be invaded by countries across the sea to FORCE us.

I think you should brush up your knowledge on this episode in American history called the ""Civil War"". It took quite literally a war to stop Americans from enslaving black people.

Yet, unlike Germany, Confederate flags are still being flown in another states. That's as if you'd fly a Nazi flag in Berlin today.

But we should _also_ be aware the transformation that came in the 75 years after. Not as a ""both sides"" issue, but as a lesson that admission and reckoning with the evil past is worthwhile. It's very rare in history that this happened. But it made Germany a better, fairer society. And it's a lesson to everyone that evil doesn't disappear by itself, and also that it can be acknowledged and the country only becoming better of it.

So its good that the German Redditor reminded us of this. But it would be better if all citizens of the western world already knew that there is a way to take responsibility for the horrors of the past and not become a weaker society from it. 

Don't forget that there is a reason in many countries the tale of reckoning is kind of ignored: Too many countries, whether it's the UK, the Netherlands or Russia, avoid taking responsibility for crimes against humanity (albeit less bad than the Holocaust some are still pretty bad) themselves because they fear it makes them look weak.

I get it that you explained it, OP, because it's apparently still needed. I just wish it wasn't necessary and I think part of that responsibility falls on other nations to make sure it isn't. It is the least that can be expected when a country makes such a significant reckoning with the past.

PS: I am not German myself.

Edit: To be clear, I'm not annoyed Germans need to learn about WW2, or carry some form of cross-generational responsibility, or prove that they're fine people. On the contrary, I think that is necessary and _good_, I just wish more countries knew about it already and cared enough about it that it doesn't need to be explained to them time and time again.

Edit 2: Most comments understand my point but some seem to think I'm trying to absolve Germany of their responsibility or something. Quite the contrary, I'm saying that it is super important that Germany keeps reckoning with the past, both privately and publicly. Until eternity if you ask me. **And the rest of the world should know about it, because as it stands now many people seem to not even be aware of it.**"
thenetherlands,fpwwfd9,t1_fpwfajn,1588971210.0,"Eens. Ik vond het jammer dat ze destijds niet in de coalitie stapten, vooral omdat ik hoopte dat ze samen met D66 genoeg tegengewicht konden bieden. Maar inmiddels zie ik ook in dat dat al tijdens de onderhandelingen er niet in zat, en heb ik respect voor de keuze van GL om principes voorop te stellen. Wellicht dat zij dan ook daarom mijn stem verdienen."
thenetherlands,fpv6kxx,t1_fpv229v,1588936641.0,Ik ben al vele jaren D66 lid en ben het helaas 100% met je eens. Heb de laatste verkiezingen niet meer op D66 gestemd en zal dan volgend jaar ook niet doen. (Twijfel nog tussen GL en PvdA.)

todayilearned,fpro5m5,t1_fprlvjb,1588858682.0,OP is asking whether 2 litres of hydrogen is much at all. It's cool termites can make hydrogen but if it takes 1000 liters per kilometre for a vehicle it's probably not that efficient. I don't have the answer to his question.

OurPresident,fpo2n8k,t1_fpljxv6,1588777271.0,"Exactly. I made the same point in this same comment section and was immediately made out for a Biden supporter, ""ruling class"" and ""arrogant scum""."
UnresolvedMysteries,fpn51sq,t3_gcjp4z,1588750503.0,"Please add a NSFL warning for the link to the Kendrick Johnson case. The official Reddit app shows a thumbnail of the boys disfigured post-mortem face at the top of the post. It's truly horrifying, and the post itself provides warnings (it was written before thumbnails were introduced by Reddit)."

You're talking to a 27 year old Bernie supporter of three years. Who said once that an argument made by Daou isn't strong. That doesn't make me ruling class. Apparently it makes me a smug prick."
