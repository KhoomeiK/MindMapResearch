They start you off with at least 20 hrs of helping out in studio to get crafts ready, organize donated materials, do odds and ends. Once you've done that you can help run weekend workshops and facilitate hospital activities.

There are also usually volunteer opportunities with Parks & Recreation in the summer, also with PBOT always needs volunteers for Sunday Parkways, those start in May. Both of those opportunities get you out in the sunshine (or rain) and engaged with the community at large."

NMBC is not a masterpiece, but for a long time it was revolutionary and it did its job inspiring so many other artists. My mom, aside from having an extended macabre phase, has always been obsessed with miniature versions of things. I think the behind the scenes shit for NMBC really excited her (and they are exciting if you're into stop-motion, but even more if you're a mall goth-- and my mom was a mall punk in the 80s). 

I'm so tempted to say a lot more in its favor *because* of the childish fondness I have for it, but that being said, I still remember a time where it was obscure. By the time I was like 12 or 13 it was all over Hot Topic, it had never been too obscure to not have merchandise before that, my mom's early-90's NMBC collection is proof enough of that. 

It's totally overrated. It's a fun concept, it was executed well. It's a holiday film, two holidays even. But that's it. Still, there are fucking devotees that act like it's a love story or that Jack's angst over wanting to fucking own another holiday somehow relates to their own struggles?? Truly, wtf?

I was a hardcore Bernie supporter who eventually voted for Clinton. I went to campaign events when I could, I canvassed, and caucused for him in Washington state, was even my district's caucus leader. Bernie was a big deal in the primaries, he's a big deal now.

NPR hardly covered him. They covered Clinton, but far more they covered the GOP primaries. You could've easily assumed Clinton was running unopposed if you only listened to NPR. What we have now is just Bernie blindness 2.0.

I started listening to NPR over a decade ago, I was a teen who wanted to be more engaged in the world around me, it was a great gateway to understanding global politics, but in the age of the internet and globalism there are far more sources for me to reference. Still, you can't deny that NPR is an important news source, especially in more rural parts of the US, especially to older people who are less likely to go online for more news sources.

Even my paternal white side were just slightly better off. My paternal grandma's family emigrated to the PNW from Arkansas bc they were living in poverty, the only work they had was migrant farming. Tbh my paternal grandpa has never been wealthy but he is very spoiled in comparison bc he's just been living off of being a musician and selling weed for like 50 years but that's 1/4, and it's the one white male in the mix.

 OP's generalization is ignoring that poverty is as old as capitalism. Probably their grandparents are assholes, and I'm sorry for that, OP probably doesn't deserve that, but it's so weird to make this generalization and ignore that there are more backgrounds than your own."

thedailyzeitgeist,f62obmp,t3_dq4sgb,1572663843.0,"I responded on the original Twitter thread, but Jamie's tweet was really, weirdly affirming. Pressure to fit into an ideal body type is so entrenched in modern society (not just American) that it is really something you can absorb but never seriously question until it almost kills you.

 It's not just exclusive to women, but it definitely is more frequently targeted at us. I didn't get my first taste of body insecurity from a show or media, it was from my mom being obsessed over my weight when I wasn't even 10 yet, and I have never been overweight. I know she herself has extreme dysmorphia and brought home any us Weekly or People Magazine talking about celebrity weight loss and would pile them around the house.

 I am 26 now and I am still constantly reminding myself that I have an eating disorder and THAT'S what's unhealthy, not my weight. I'm not dangerously thin, either, so I worry that maybe I'm actually supposed to have an eating disorder. It's a mental illness, but people who don't suffer from it act like it's a choice or a punchline when they can't be bothered to think of anything else. I'd argue that it may start out as a choice, I know that I actually saw bulimia joked about on TV growing up, and I made a choice to ""try it out"" when I was 12 bc then I'd get criticized less by my mom and more people would like me. No, none of that has ever been true, even when I was 40 lbs lighter than I am today. It's a sort of addiction, and it isn't something you just decide to stop doing. It's not even about weight a lot of the time for me. More than half of my life.

 I'm glad Jamie brought it up on the podcast."

I was raised in a non, almost anti-religious household where my mom (a black woman) denounced rap as ""obnoxious."" It felt damn near rebellious to listen to Kanye then, even tho I didn't and don't believe in Jesus it was clear how passionate he was about his god and it was a good intro to him, got me into Through the Wire and All Falls Down. I was hooked for what felt like forever, but obviously things started loosening up after the masterpiece that was MBDTF. But ... How do you go from Jesus Walks to THIS??"

It's also hard bc I'm half black but have an average body, I've been mocked for having a ""white butt"" by ""friends"" most of my life until I stopped spending time with people who say shit like that. It's hard to see girls of every race having tiny waists and big butts every time I open IG and want to search something. Good for them if they're proud of their real bodies, but if you're digitally altering your body before you post a pic you're creating an unrealistic beauty standard for yourself and perpetuating that insecurity in others. I like this sub specifically bc it reminds me that it's not just ads, pro photographers, and magazines that Photoshop women's bodies."
