When we were cleaning out the house after she died, I found at a Father's Day thing I did in first(?) grade... it was a totally bullshit story. I never did anything with my dad growing up.

It was hard for me to even think of this as an option until recently. Because while my mother was alive, I'd never been able to have a relationship because I was so enmeshed with her. The one time I tried, all I heard about was how this girl was a piece of shit and using me (which... she was... but she just knew this despite there being no evidence of it, because why else would anyone like me?) When it turned out she WAS a piece of shit, it just confirmed what everyone else had thought... that I was unlovable.

It was only after this that I finally realized that now that I was no longer a kid, there was a good chance that only one person still left on this planet would ever love me. And that person... was me. Was I okay with that? Was that enough?

It was enough to get up out of bed every day. A very lonely existence, though. I suspect that's what it's like for narcs. But I knew I couldn't be angry about it. I couldn't alienate whatever people didn't think I sucked.

Well, it turns out people give a shit when people's parents die and when they're about to become homeless. Including random strangers who would become friends. And a friend of a friend who apparently had known about me and really wanted to meet me...

My mom got my older sister's father to pay for her college. He was never in her life, it was all done through the courts. She also went to private high school that my parents paid for, which my younger sister and I did not. We were told that college was the bare minimum, even if I had wanted to dig ditches for the rest of my life. Although, paying for it was never really talked about.

She paid for my first two years of college, when all of a sudden... she lost her six-figure job and decided to blow through her savings because ""then they'll give us financial aid"" (spoiler: turns out colleges don't have sympathy for parents who intentionally make their kids poor?) Then it became ""I'll pay for your first TWO years."" My younger sister was starting and she had to pay for her... I was on my own.

So I suggest to her that maybe I should go to a community college... oh was THAT a mistake.

**""Do you KNOW the kind of people that go to those?""**

What, poor people? Yeah, I think that's kinda what we are now. Maybe I'll fit in better?

I ended up going to a college full of rich kids out of state, that I could not afford, could not do well in (failed out twice, though I eventually ended up getting straight A's after she forced me into homelessness?) and though I had turned my grades around, was still not able to graduate.

Do we like Selena because she's an objectively good singer?

That's why it's interesting to me that Selena is the one who has it here, she is generally regarded as the more ""normal"" one. So even if you don't like either of their music, you can still find something kinda cool about this.

Though if that's your most intellectual thought on female singers I suspect I'm a little over your head. Do you only like death growls?"
BipolarReddit,fmgj9mg,t1_fmghe4v,1586050289.0,I've got a collection of Norwegian Black Metal that could rock your socks off and I fucking LOVE both Miley and Selena.
BipolarReddit,fmgbd53,t1_fmg94ed,1586045277.0,"Selena Gomez, the singer. She's been pretty famous for about a decade now."
BipolarReddit,fmg7ame,t1_fmg5gnf,1586042765.0,Believe me I totally get it. I also kinda wish she talked a little more about it to at least provide an understanding for all the people out there who DON'T get it.
BipolarReddit,fmg4ek1,t1_fmg1a71,1586041026.0,"Yeah, we totally can. I'm definitely not opposed to discussions about privilege. I don't think there's really a bigger factor in what determines your experience with this disorder.

Like for me, the expectation of being able to talk about it for the purpose of ""reducing the stigma"" means you're in a position of privilege anyway. Sometimes a celebrity will come out as bipolar under totally different circumstances... like usually after some kind of wild behavior, they might disclose the diagnosis in hopes that it would explain what some of us might be thinking. Like what would happen if Britney Spears just admitted she was bipolar? (I don't think there has ever been confirmation of any specific diagnosis for her, but actually think about if the whole world at once could all be like... ""so THAT'S why she did that?"")

So I definitely have more respect for her doing this than I would someone who is trying to do damage control and brings up the word ""bipolar"", but I really wouldn't see her as any kind of authority on how to live with this disorder. Just find it interesting to know we do have more stuff in common with these people than we'd like to think."
BipolarReddit,fmg1gf8,t1_fmfzggh,1586039281.0,"I have to admit I saw the headline on TV a few hours ago before I looked it up... and I was thinking ""she's talked about that before, right?""

And that's when I realized even though I am a huge fan of Selena and know a ton of songs by her, I still confuse her with Demi Lovato.

But the fact that the BOTH of them (and many others) have been so open about having bipolar... really makes me feel a lot less weird."

I've been doing okay through this, mostly. But yesterday was a tough day... my aunt passed away yesterday on her 70th birthday. Not the way so many people are dying right now... in the comfort of her own home, with her husband, my mother's brother, by her side. You might remember, it was just a little over a year ago she was diagnosed with brain cancer. She was a mother figure to me... and she was two weeks older than my mom, who died almost three years ago now and I'm still not even close to having dealt with that... this is all kinda hitting me at once?

Hope you've been well. I think I'm honestly dealing with this pretty well because I'm so used to expecting worse case scenarios... this really isn't all that bad."

BipolarReddit,fjjleel,t3_fdo4d2,1583401847.0,"What kind of doctor is this?

A lot of psychologists/therapists will emphasize your trauma because even as we struggle with a more biological mental illness, the shit that happened still affected us.

But I've never heard a psychiatrist (that is, one who's going to treat me with medication) ever really consider my PTSD. A lot of the ones I've had seem even less concerned about diagnosis and more about medication response.

As for how to distinguish it... it's kind of a blur for me. But I've realized most of my interpersonal problems have little to do with bipolar. I am DAMAGED. And I feel worthless because of it. Bipolar doesn't help, but I know not everyone who has it deals with the level of insecurity that I do."

BipolarReddit,fjjfzo8,t3_fdpl1l,1583394354.0,"What's good bro? It's been a minute... hope you've been hanging in there.

I've had a weird situation with a girl for several months now. Long story short, she's been in an out of an abusive relationship... and just when things are starting to come together a few weeks ago, he went blind in one eye (he has diabetes) and now she's been taking care of him and watching his daughter while he works. I guess he's calmed down on the abusive bullshit now that he needs her... yeah, of course that's gonna last...

With this in mind I've been hyper-aware of the fact that if I ever act the way he does towards her, she might just tell me to fuck off (as she has to him many times.) But I'm pretty sure the same could be said for the way I treat other women. Like my sisters. I could totally see myself doing the same thing you did... neither one of them is easy to deal with. (This is one of those times where I breathe a sigh of relief that she will never have to meet my mother.)

Perhaps your girl thinks of your sister as someone supportive... someone you shouldn't talk to like that? Yet it's so easy to fall into old habits when you grew up in a family where everyone yelled awful things at each other and everything was forgotten about the next day. Funny, because people have tried that with me at work... and I'm just like no, fuck this, that's not how the world works. For other people that's the kind of shit that ends relationships.

So do you want her back? All you can really do is wait... and I'm so sorry if it doesn't happen. This was one of the hardest lessons I ever had to learn. I can't be that angry guy again. I've worked damn hard to un-learn all the shit that was programmed in me by my drunk Irish Catholic family... and fuck, if I can do THAT, you can too."

Work sucks. I was working with a guy I had a lot of fun with, so much that I paid for his Ubers. But then I got sick of it and that was the end of him. Now, I just trained the Haitian laundry lady's cousin on dish, despite her not knowing a word of English or even French, which I speak (you would think she know it considering... you know... it's THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE OF HER COUNTRY... but I guess it's common for them to only know Creole.) Tonight, after serving as an unofficial busser and working with the laundry lady yelling at me in Creole, I let my manager know tonight that I was interested in bussing for maybe ONE shift a week. He's like ""uhhh...""

Yeah, really? Were you just going to keep me here all this time? Because if that's all you saw me doing, I'd feel too insulted to keep working there. For real.

I don't know. I got a raise a couple weeks ago, and then this past week was given an award (for being the most ""fun"" for the month, basically, but I'll take it.) So I'm feeling a little more confident... to the point where I actually feel comfortable setting boundaries with these people. I was afraid to do that before.
