depression,faems25,t1_fadt4dz,1576003892.0,"First accept urself know ur weakness and power points

Second give urself time u may lose things and steps but with time everything will become good as u wish and more

Third start by very very simple steps and be happy for urself dont always say this is so small and i can manage biggest be far just say yes okay i can do more bigger but this what iam going to do for now and am happy with it i accept myself ..

Fourth IMPORTANT be as far as u can from negative people that gonna do nothing but make u question urself worth and that bad ideas be away from them even if they are friends or family 

Fifth keep dwelling and love urself as u are and change little by little 

Although am not expert but with these things i managed to start getting on right way 

Dont compare and dont judge urself"
