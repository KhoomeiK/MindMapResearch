HealthAnxiety,fphzx7i,t1_fph96j8,1588630947.0,Thank you for responding! I have noticed my posture is awful as I've been home the past month and a half. I definitely think I have shallow breathing too. I think from all of the anxiety I've become a chest breather instead of breathing from my diaphragm. Were the breathing exercises difficult at first? I tend to have trouble with breathing during meditation.

HealthAnxiety,fp9qcbo,t3_gc3w6n,1588432310.0,"Yes! A few weeks go I was having frequent panic attacks and daily anxiety. I also didn't have an appetite, which was a contributor. I literally got to the point where I could barely walk I was so weak. My muscles got tired doing the smallest of tasks. I thought I was dying. I ended up going to the doctor and getting blood work, but everything was fine. Just anxiety. The way the doctor explained it was that anxiety makes our cortisol levels go up, and it's like our body is constantly running a marathon even if we haven't actually moved. 

I was prescribed medication and I'm able to eat normally again. I still have anxiety, but not as often. I am not as tired doing small tasks. So it does get better!

Here to talk if you need it!"

You're smart to think about your age being a factor. Most people survive this. The media makes it seem worse because they focus on the negative outcomes. That's what I try to remember.

HealthAnxiety,fomz6qh,t3_g88c2q,1587908179.0,"When I was 11, I was home alone and a chip got stuck in my throat. I had my first panic attack (tingling hands, shaking, hyperventilating). After that,  I was terrified to eat for fear of choking and I developed severe anxiety. I was in the exact same boat as you, only consuming liquids. When I would try to eat solids, I would chew non-stop and couldn't bring myself to swallow. I remember being so scared to die due to malnutrition, but at the same time I was scared to die from choking. 

This was one of the toughest times in my life. I went to therapy and was told I couldn't be helped because the therapist thought I had an eating disorder. My family had no idea how to help. I kept hyperventilating and my mom took me to the ER twice (that was when I was diagnosed with anxiety and hyperventilation). I remember riding by a cemetery and imagining my family picking out a casket for my funeral. At people's houses, I would spit my food into a napkin to pretend I was eating or I would hide food and then flush it down the toilet. My anxiety got so bad I could barely ride in a car without getting a panic attack. 

In all honesty, one day I just had enough. It was like all this strength and bravery just came over me. I ate a hotdog of all things. I didn't chew a thousand times. I just ate normally. 

I think no matter how much support you have, you are your biggest supporter. You have the power to take control. It's definitely not easy, but if I can get through it, so can you! Take it slow, start with something soft, take small bites, even if it's just a few and then you're done for the day.

I believe in you. You've got this. Stay strong and know you are not alone!"

Anxiety,folqf4d,t3_g85qgi,1587868048.0,"I think it's smart to be on the lookout for symptoms. But also know that you took the appropriate precautions and so did those around you.

I recently listened to a podcast by the Anxiety Coaches. It focused on coronavirus, how to deal with moments of anxiety, and how not to panic. Basically the woman mentioned that until symptoms arise (and not saying they will for sure), you have nothing to worry about. If something should come up, deal with it then and as you would if coronavirus didn't exist. Try to be in the present moment. Being pregnant, you definitely should be as relaxed as possible."

HealthAnxiety,folo9ay,t3_g85moo,1587866614.0,"Sit down and find something funny to watch on TV, youtube, tiktok, etc. You need to distract your mind before you try laying down again. Fully focus on what you're watching. Or find something else that is distracting. I find that journaling helps me. Literally writing down every thought in my mind. What happens is your hand can't keep up with your brain and it forces your thoughts to slow down. 

I've been where you are and it is so scary, but you will get through it! Anxiety tricks us into thinking we can't breathe when we actually can."
Anxiety,foll6u6,t3_g81u5j,1587864630.0,"I went through this for a few weeks at the beginning of lock down. I had no appetite whatsoever. I got to the point I could barely walk.

Also, try light foods. Toast, crackers, just to get something in your body. I was also hungry in the mornings so I tried to eat right away before anxiety kicked in too much. 

I had to go to the doctor because I felt so crappy. I was prescribed medication for my anxiety which has helped tremendously. I would recommend trying a teledoc appointment if you can't be seen elsewhere. Or maybe an Urgent Care. 

Hope you start to gain some appetite soon!"

HealthAnxiety,fol16os,t3_g80ix6,1587852861.0,"I listened to a really good podcast about this. It's called the Anxiety Coaches podcast. The woman did a recent episode on anxiety and the coronavirus. 

She said it's really important to notice your symptoms, take note of them, and then check back in later. No need to worry in between. You are at a 99.9 fever right now, but that's not really too high of a fever. Check it again in a few hours (don't get obsessive, schedule a time to do it) and then if it is higher, do exactly what you would do pre-COVID19. Take tylenol. Drink fluids. Rest. And then if another symptom arises, tackle that one too. I know it's easier said than done, but don't worry until you have to.

If you get overwhelmed, there's a chance you can increase your temp from anxiety. Mine fluctuates all the time because of it. Also, notice how you feel. When my temp is in the 99s, I ask myself, ""Do I actually feel feverish?"" Most of the time you can tell if you're getting sick.


Hopefully this was helpful. Good luck!"

My doctor prescribed .25mg 3x per day as needed of lorazepam months ago when my anxiety wasn't yet at an all time high. I refused to even take the script to the pharmacy because I was scared and didn't want to have to rely on medication. 

Well, the first few weeks of the stay at home order were terrible. I was having panic attacks almost daily and I had to be honest with my doctor that I hadn't been taking the meds. Once I finally picked them up, they sat in the kitchen for days before I finally had the courage to try one. I looked up reviews and everything (yes, I'm that person) and was terrified of side effects. Not to mention lorazepam can be addictive. The first time I took one I legitimately had a panic attack after I took it because I was so worried about how it'd make me feel. I have only been taking 1 per day because I'm scared, but I had a teledoc appointment with my doctor today and he recommended I try at least 2 a day since I'm still having issues.

I ended up sending a message to my primary care doctor and he asked me to come in. Turns out, my exhaustion was a combination of anxiety and low vitamin D.

I was so scared of how I'd feel, I was on the verge of a panic attack right after taking it. I struggle with things I cannot control (most people with anxiety do) and not knowing what would happen after taking the meds was scary.

I told myself that I had to put faith in my doctor and trust that he thinks the benefits will outweigh the cons. Honestly, I felt better a little while after taking it, but still the slightest bit on edge. I'm not sure if it takes a few times to have the full effect. My dosage is also really small (.25mg). 

I say if you have someone you trust at home with you, it's probably fine to take the Xanax. Do your best to calm yourself beforehand and if you feel any side effects (which are usually pretty rare), call your doctor.

-Journaling. Yesterday I was feeling short of breath so I started writing down literally every thought. I try to create counter statements such as ""The doctor said you are healthy."" I ended up writing until my thoughts became random and weren't focused on my breath anymore. 

-Use an app like Sanvello or Calm to meditate. I particularly like one grounding exercise that has you connect with your senses. (Name 5 things you see, 4 things you feel, 3 things you hear, 2 things you smell, 1 thing you taste).

-Read. If you can focus enough to read a book, your mind will become distracted.

-This one might seem silly, but I write down positive reminders/quotes/prayers/etc. I read these to help me realize I'm okay. 

-Speak with a therapist. There are lots of online options. It helps to talk to someone who knows how to help you cope.

Don't forget that anxiety is not dangerous, it's just insanely uncomfortable. You will get through this! PM me anytime you need to."

I just try to keep my brain occupied as best as I can. I know it's easier said than done. 

I've tried essential oils which help sometimes, but aren't consistent for me. I have tried medication from the doctor, but had side effects. I also don't want to be reliant on medication every day.

You would think after experiencing it again and again, we would realize we're not in any real danger. But it's very difficult to have that mind over matter mentality in the moment. 

Thank you for sharing! It's nice to know that I'm not alone."
Anxiety,fh67t5a,t1_fh64bad,1581295970.0,"I'm so sorry you have to go through this. I just got over a panic attack which stemmed from shortness of breath before writing this, so I completely understand.  

I developed anxiety when I was 11. Full blown panic attacks. It was really bad. I couldn't even ride in a car, go to the movies, etc. I always needed an escape plan in case something was to go wrong. I eventually worked through it on my own. For years, I was completely fine (I'm 29 now). It started up again this past summer. Since then, I feel like every day is a new symptom. 

The shortness of breath comes and goes. I can usually talk myself through it, but it's very scary to feel like you can't breathe. Even though our bodies are designed to breath voluntarily, my mind can't seem to grasp that in the moment. 

I've experienced nausea as well. It's ridiculous how many ways anxiety can wreak havoc on our bodies. 

I hope you find a little bit of comfort in knowing you're not alone!"

It doesn't matter how many times it's happened, I worry about it regardless. I also get the pain you mentioned. It's very hard to convince yourself it's anxiety and that it will be okay.

I'm glad to know I'm not the only one who experiences this. Feel free to message me if you ever need someone to talk to."
