But I don't think that's its the end of the world for you (or for anyone). Not having any friends right now does make it harder to make it through mental health troubles. But I think you can reframe the situation with some work :) if you want to get better, then you can do it. Take this opportunity of being single, and not having to attend to friends, and you have so much time to work on yourself! Sleep when you want, eat what you want, go where you want, do things that are fun for you. Be your own boyfriend /girlfriend. This is the time you don't have to deal with any one else's problems, so you can take care of your own. It's a great opportunity :)

And I don't mean you need to get back on your feet immediately. Take time to grieve the situation if you need it. Every feeling you experience is valid. But there's no need to lament being single, or not having many friends. Friends come and go anyway - - think about your friends when you were 4. They're probably not your friends anymore, just because that's what happens with time. That means that somewhere in your future, you have new and better friends. Somewhere in your future, you have a partner who is good. And because you will have worked on your own health, it will be more fun for both of you.

So when you're ready, forget everyone and take this opportunity to get to know yourself and take care of yourself :) eventually, you'll look back on your life and see that this was a rare opportunity to give yourself as much love as possible <3"
DepressionRecovery,ffeiiwg,t3_ep6nv0,1579849402.0,"Just the fact that you are ready /willing to accept positive thoughts is a sign of your resilience, your desire to get better. That is amazing! It is more than can be said for some others so be proud of that :)

It's awesome that you're able to do this soothing action of walking to make yourself feel better. Down days happen and they can really suck but theyre not forever. As long as everyday you listen to yourself and what you need and you try your best, it's a step forward even if your mood feels like a step backwards.

Think of it like going to the gym - - but for your mind. Every time you have a down day and get back up, it's one rep of training yourself to be more resilient. And if you think of it that way, then you can see each down day as an opportunity to train yourself in getting back up! Maybe that's too optimistic. It can be really hard to be in a down day. Your feelings are valid. And we're all here for you."

In regards to me feeling terrible on day 4 -- I started day 1 unable to fall asleep for the second core so soon after the first core, so I only ended up getting 90 min of sleep (because it took me 90 min to fall asleep). Second day, I fell asleep in seconds for the first core, but again, took me about an hour to fall asleep for the second core. Do you think this is unusual?

DepressionRecovery,fd1s2yp,t3_ejumwh,1578135928.0,"I think in these cases, it's good to have a support system. When I feel apathetic like you've described, it gives you a huge head start of you have someone to come up to you personally, and say get up and wash the dishes please. And if I say no, they help me off the bed and to the sink.

When I have no one like that, it can take days to do anything, and that makes everything even more depressing, so I get it. That apathy is not your fault. Remember that. That apathy is not you.

Have someone you trust and who is supportive help you find a doctor and therapist if you haven't already. Sometimes medication is so helpful to just Jumpstart your recovery. Even if you only end up taking it for a month or something. And a therapist is everything to overcoming depression. It can be so hard to engage in the administrative slog of trying to find these professionals and make all the calls and stuff, and having someone help you do that will make UT much more achievable."

Once I'm out of the danger zone, I try to be present. That's the most important thing. You can't predict the future. Your mind thinks it can, but of course no one can! 

Try to catch yourself thinking ""what if..."" or ""in the future, how will I..."" and bring yourself back to the present. I'm home. I'm safe. I decide what I want to do. Not my parents, friends, society, whatever. I decide. And don't think about what you want to do in the future, think about what you want to do right now, and give yourself permission to do those things, whether it is read a book, eat a pizza, study for that exam, or curl up in bed and cry.

It takes time to train your mind to be present and not let it try to predict the future and worry you. I'm still working on it, just don't give up!
