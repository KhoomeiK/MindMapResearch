AskReddit,fr56dju,t1_fr542j1,1589903294.0,"Good to know your buzz is intact, lol. Yeah, I think that Andrew Yang probably had the best idea as to how we could best make the economy more navigable for poorer people while stimulating the economy at the same time, with UBI.  
  
Essentially you institute a VAT tax, so when the wealthy spend money on luxury items we tax them at the point of sale. This avoids the problem with taking money that would otherwise be used to keep the economy going, which is a problem with taxation in general.  
  
One of the main reasons that it would likely work well is that there's no need for a bureaucratic money pit to do means testing and issue payments to only particular people, it would be for everyone.  
  
His main argument for the need of UBI was that automation is going to put a lot of people out of work and this will help people make ends meet while they're figuring out how to adjust. But it also would've been a game changer during this pandemic."

AskReddit,fr4xgg8,t1_fr4ub7w,1589898717.0,"I don't mean to harsh your buzz, lol. But your argument fails. First, there are many things that are necessities every bit as much as pads or tampons. We have to eat, why not make food free for everyone? We have to have clothes and shelter, why not make homes and clothes free for everyone?  
  
Secondly, women don't need pads or tampons, they can use menstrual cups. Of course that might be uncomfortable for them, but comfort doesn't equal necessity.  
  
The real reason why people always bring up feminine hygiene products in these discussions isn't because this is something that can be argued that government is particularly better at providing, such as healthcare or military. The reason is that it's symbolic, in some people's minds, of how particularly unfair and difficult it is to be a woman, so we owe it to them to ease their burden. Which is just patently absurd. Life is difficult, it's not fair, everybody has their own particular cross to bear and women don't have it any harder than men, regardless of what the politically correct narratives that are shoved down our throats say."

This fact lends further weight to the conclusion that pedophilia does not apply to you.”  
  
So the reasoning here is that this woman performed, among other absolute horrors, genital and anal oral sex on a 2 year old, on video, smiling and smacking her lips, because she was a masochist that enjoyed *her* humiliation in the act.  
  
She acted at her husband's direction in her humiliation. Though some of the videos were made without her husband being there. And she purchased child porn online before she ever met her husband. But none of this matters because women cannot be pedophiles, women have no paraphilic sexual deviancies other than masochism.  
  
Oh, and all those teachers who molested their students? Merely psychologically damaged, lonely women looking for comfort.  
  
Let's be honest here, the entirety of their positions on women's sexual deviancy paints women as being mere victims, regardless of the evidence to the contrary. This is what happens when political correctness overrules reason in academia, plain and simple."
