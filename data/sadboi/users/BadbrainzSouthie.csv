I‚Äôm a 26yo guy, I struggle daily with anxiety, depression and the overwhelming belief that I am not good enough or worth anyone‚Äôs time. You are definitely not alone in thinking the way you do, I am literally twice your age and still struggle to talk to people, even my family. It started when I was your age actually, I went from being decently social and friendly to what I am today and to be honest I think it all comes from my chaotic upbringing. I didn‚Äôt think my childhood was ‚Äúthat bad‚Äù until now, my dad was and is a struggling alcoholic and even though he was there for us financially he wasn‚Äôt there emotionally and a lot of the time physically. What I‚Äôm saying is that I didn‚Äôt think I had anything to feel sad about or to complain about but the truth is it was hard on me.

I struggle with this belief that I am weird, stupid, ugly, annoying, a disappointment, an imposter, all things negative basically. I have spent so many years thinking negatively about myself that I cannot even imagine myself as anything else. I don‚Äôt know if this will work for you, but a favorite comedian of mine once said ‚Äúyou are who you are in your head‚Äù, and for whatever reason it clicked with me that I think all these negative thoughts about myself and assume that others think of me in the same way.

Be nice to yourself and do your best not to assume what others are thinking. 

I don‚Äôt want to make the decision for you but from reading your post I would strongly suggest you stop hanging out with your friends who you said are mean to you or call you ugly, they might say it‚Äôs only a joke but if it‚Äôs hurting you that‚Äôs all that should matter. Do your best not to let anyone give you shit. 

The best thing and yes it is difficult, but the best thing you can do for anxiety when it comes to talking to people is to do it more often, it‚Äôs called exposure therapy and even though it sucks it does help.

TLDR; I hope what I wrote makes any sense to you. I have been noticing a lot of my writing lately has been full of rambling and not very uniform/organized. I just wanted to reach out and say that what you are going through is both common and normal for your age. Keep your chin up and be nicer to yourself, you seem very introspective for your age and be proud of who you are."

No one got hurt, I am guessing you didn‚Äôt since you did not mention it, so there is no need to worry over it. It is perfectly ok to be upset about it in the moment but I am sure your friend will not be mad at you, (would you be mad at them had you helped them paint their mirror and they broke it?)

So breaking the mirror was not a bad thing, shit happens and it is going to be ok. Clean it up when you feel up to it, sooner is better than later since it might be dangerous to have shards of glass lying around, and let it be the past.

I hope you are feeling better since posting this."

I think you just need to let your therapist know how painful it has been for you lately. It sounds like you are doing great! If I have learned anything it is that being completely transparent, especially in emotional situations, is key to getting through it with a positive outlook. I actually cried for the first time in therapy today and while I fought back the tears as hard as I could there was something freeing about being able to be that vulnerable and open with my therapist. 

In short, imo it sounds like you might benefit from letting your therapist know just how stressed all of these new revelations are making you. Also remember you don‚Äôt have to have something specific to talk about every time, sometimes you can make unexpected progress."
