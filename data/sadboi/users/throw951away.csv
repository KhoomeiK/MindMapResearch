Acceptance. Accept that the person was always mostly terrible. It's unfortunate that you were the specific one that they abused. Viewing them as a childish brat may help. Imagine they are a physical child when you remember the abuse. Try to think of it as coming from a spoiled or abused child. When I saw that my own abuser's actions were so ridiculous, I wondered why I took them so seriously. I began to laugh so hard when I realized ""they're just like a mean child, so what does that make me?"" More mature? Idk, but it felt good because I finally felt superior to them in some way. My abuse was only psychological/emotional though. I have not much experience with physical abuse.

Gratitude. Rather than beat yourself up about your past, find things to be grateful for now. You might have a good friend, or good family member. Maybe you just live in a place with electricity, or you can afford the latest phone, or your city has clean water. Maybe you're just grateful that you can breathe deeply, or that you can sleep for 8 hours and feel rested. Maybe you're just happy you're still here and providence or fate has allowed you another day to live. The future isn't guaranteed after all.

I'm grateful to be alive, to have woken up this morning. Even though I find it very difficult to follow my goals and conform to society's expectations, I'm happy that I still have the chance to attempt things.

I'm grateful I'm allowed to give advice, even if mine might not be the best or what you need to hear to heal. I'll accept that I'm inadequate."

ptsd,f6og1vi,t3_ds78cs,1573016607.0,"It's not strictly necessary, but you will find it infinitely easier to forget or rather remove your mind from the past if you do forgive them.

If you're not a Buddha and you can't focus solely on the present at all times, which is probably impossible as a human, then I advise forgiveness. Even if you only pretend to forgive them at first, do it to trick yourself into feeling a bit better, for you and for your healing.

Imagine two scenarios.

You refuse to forgive them. The story remains open and it implies that you would be happy to take revenge, even if you're probably too ""cowardly"" or don't want to ruin your own life by doing so. It takes strength to not take revenge, cowardly is probably the wrong word. You have anger and pain that you're unwilling to let go. You might deny that it happened, you might hate yourself for allowing it to happen or for being too powerless to save yourself when it happened. You might deny that you hate yourself for being weak and failing to protect yourself. I did! This was my deep insight, I denied that I hated myself for being weak and allowing it to happen. I almost blamed myself for it. I did blame myself for being a victim.

Now the second scenario.

You forgive them. The story has an ending. You focus less of your mental time in the past. You have space now to heal, you are capable of being happy today, even if you're alone. You can show yourself love. You can remove the poisonous feelings of hate, anger and vengeance. Maybe the person who hurt you won't ever do anything to deserve your forgiveness, but that isn't your responsibility.

You can use your imagination to get what you need from them. In fiction, often the guilty party will apologize or beg for forgiveness with a sincere heart. Depending on the violation and the past leading up to the unforgivable act, the characters may even get closer or become friends. Of course that's fiction, the ideal. Your guilty friend might never apologize. So, imagine it. Imagine them begging for forgiveness with a sincere heart. You can do it as many times as you want. If you were the abuser, use your imagination to help you see a situation where you apologize and they forgive you. It's good to heal and love yourself.

You're free."

I can only hope that the personal pain I'm putting myself through due to this will be enough soon. When will it be enough for me to say I'm done punishing myself? I don't know.

Maybe I believe I won't be strong enough without putting myself under a lot of pain? Then if that's false, I need to just stop it now so that I can prove to myself that I am strong. I need to take some action. I need a total paradigm shift.

Consider the case of buying a breakout. You want to buy immediately so you set a stop-limit buy order above the range so that it will trigger when the price trades above the range. Note here that you are waiting for a worse price, but you're willing to take the worse price because now your conditions for entry have been met. A stop-limit only executes when the limit is reached and not before.

Stop order is a simple stop loss, but when you consider it, it's similar to a stop-limit in that you're selling below the current bid on exit. The difference here is that you're not yet in the position when you place a stop-limit order.

Limit orders are used to open, similar to stop-limit, but in the case of limit orders, you place your offer below the ask for buys, and above the bid for sells. This requires the market to give you a more favorable price before executing. You can get a better price with a limit order because you can get filled below the ask when buying.

Market orders, you're buying the ask and selling the bid. The current bid and ask are the currently best offered limit orders from others. Market buy will fill their limit sell order, if they have the best (lowest) offer."

future,f5eatos,t3_dnopet,1572167720.0,"Hi.

There are different people, cultures all with different beliefs on the planet.

Sometimes those beliefs are tied to rules that say, if you don't believe this then you will be punished.

Some cultures can be pretty violent when they want to defend their traditions.

For these reasons, the best way to organize the people is to separate them by culture. If they are not willing to tolerate each other, they should not coexist because that creates violence and other problems.

Let's give another example. Some people in every culture value hard work and education. Other people in the same ethnic group value pleasure and stimulation and they don't want to work hard. If they had a billion dollars they would sit forever and do nothing. Between these two groups there are lots of social problems. For example, the first group pays for just about every bill the second group should be paying on their own.

What would happen if the hard working people formed their own group / nation and the lazy people did the same? Then, the lazy people wouldn't be able to pay their bills by stealing from the hardworking in the form of taxes and redistribution of wealth.

In the end, nations with populations that can respect and tolerate each other do the best. In the cases where they can't, they should mostly be separated into more nations until they can tolerate each other within their own respective nations. At that time, peace within each nation is mostly established, though of course humans aren't perfect.

Once nations are peaceful enough, they can be more productive, and trade between them without hard feelings. At that point it isn't personal, it's just business.

Some laws are necessary such as self defense. Other laws are in place only to serve the needs of the corrupt, which is obviously not a good setup.

For you, I suggest relaxation, acceptance, and gratitude."

How's your energy level doing? Do you have any widespread minor but possibly debilitating pain?

I work from home so I'm almost exactly in your situation. In fact I was for several years and sometimes I still consider myself a hermit because I don't make enough money really to feel comfortable.

Start with getting in physical shape. Emotions exist in the body. In my own experience it was difficult to feel anything when my body was at its weakest. So you wanna get lots of water and exercise. Bodyweightfitness is a good start and you can do it for free!

I'll recommend focusing on only 3 nutrients, but there is a huge list of nutrients that you should be counting to stay healthy. The 3 are vitamin D, potassium, and protein.

If you don't get potassium your electrolytes could get so low that you suddenly die of a heart attack. If you don't get enough essential protein you can get diseases. Ok, same thing with essential fats (omega 3,6,9). Can't afford meat or eggs? Try beans and rice, or peanut butter on wheat bread. These are whole proteins as far as I remember.

Now vitamin D you might already be a bit worried about. The bad news is you can't take a huge dose by itself without bad effects. Without vitamin D your blood levels of calcium, magnesium and other stuff can get really low. If you add vitamin D but you aren't getting enough calcium and magnesium, the vitamin D will prioritize putting those things into your blood. The problem is it can't find it anywhere other than your bones. So your bones could become weak.

Good news is some vitamins have vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, and zinc all in one. I recommend taking that instead of only a huge vit D pill. Yes it costs money. Sorry about that.

Alright, now that I've gotten that out of the way, I'll recommend introspection. This is the most difficult thing you'll ever do in your life, but it can change your life dramatically. Take an hour each day and try to get to the bottom of a few key questions.

""What happened in the past that caused me to shut myself in?""

""What hobby could I do for myself that requires money, that might motivate me a little to make money?""

""What do I want to happen in the future?""

""What mindset can I get into that will allow me to feel confident even if people reject me?""

Of course there are always more questions to ask, and you know yourself better than anyone, so I'd encourage you to come up with a few of your own.

Lastly, I'd like to apologize for being so cold and matter- of- fact.

Life should be fun.

Are you really ok?"

The world is made of mind. You are connected. Your mind makes magnetic waves as you think. Your body is a conductor, mostly water, a superconductor. Around conductors there are magnetic fields. What you think has an effect on the quality of the magnetic field of your body that is always surrounding you.

Think as positively as you can. Live your life and choose to see things more optimistically and slowly build up towards filling your time with beautiful thoughts, that increase your gratitude toward life and your love for yourself. This way life will become like a dance, you will effortlessly flow from one task to another without feeling or believing that you are trapped or forced to do it.

By focusing on positive thoughts, you will find much more energy and you'll be able to sleep less. This will give you more time awake but the most important is the energy benefit you will receive. 100 years of a life full of energy and positive thinking will feel like 1000 years of impact. 100 years of negative exhausting thinking will create a life without much energy and feeling almost no impact.

abuse,f2rq4fy,t3_de15xl,1570375456.0,"You have admitted some of your abusive behaviors, but I can see very clearly that you are still covering up a lot of your behaviors.

One thing I find it very difficult to forgive someone for is threatening suicide to get their way. Someone close to me threatened suicide if I acted like an adult and it fucked me up because on one hand, I'm expected by 99.99999999% of society to be a responsible adult, and yet if I do, she might actually kill herself. Can you imagine the problems I have from this? One single moment of her selfishness, which she has no doubt forgotten, has caused me YEARS of psychological damage and self-punishment in the form of wasted time.

One single moment, where she CHOSE to be abusive instead of supportive. And she hasn't ever apologized, and I don't expect her to ever do so because, call me sexist, but I've come to accept that women do not take responsibility when they do something wrong. And neither do narcissists.

Back to your post. I can see you're making an effort to change. But I question your motives. Are you just looking for more attention by sharing this with us? You haven't really claimed a lot of your admitted actions as your own.

What you've done here is said ""I don't know why I did this (insert abusive behavior), because it's really messed up."" Fair enough, but if you take that one step further you might get closer to the truth. ""I know why I did this, and I knew it was messed up before I did it, but I chose to do it anyway."" But you won't admit that you chose to do it. Instead you dismiss the behavior as if it was just an accident. ""Oops, I pushed her a little bit too hard and somehow she fell out of her chair.""

Yes, you do have a lot of work to do on yourself. No, you cannot heal yourself, unless you do something very painful and specific. And that is, you must admit to these behaviors, you must admit that you don't care what happens to other people when you make bad decisions that hurt them. There's no such thing as losing control. You're in control, you just aren't being fair to other people.

You need to be very deliberate and detailed when you accept that you've intentionally been terrible to other people. If it makes you feel any better, you probably inherited some of these behaviors from a parent. But until you start being more truthful, I don't have any sympathy, because I've experienced enough loss from narcissists to understand that even if I pity them, I can't spend time on sympathy for them."

Absurdism as quickly as possible:

Even though there's no meaning to anything because the earth will be eaten by the sun, nobody will know your name is on the top of the donation wall because you bought the Mona Lisa for the museum, etc....

There is still a chance for each of us to feel purposeful and meaningful while we're alive. Beyond that, sure. You probably won't remember anything. Everything you learned and accomplished might disappear or get reset.

But while you're here, you can smile at someone who's looking sad. You can help the old lady with her groceries. You can stay inside for years and crank out mediocre novels.

You can't always do whatever you want, a man's gotta eat too. But you can make a real attempt at creating something for yourself.

Is there anything that you smile while you're doing it? Do more of it if you think happiness is preferable. Exercise might take effort, but it beats getting sick or injured.

The pain of existence might never go away. But even if that pain has to stay here as long as I'm alive, I can introduce it to my friend called passion."

emotionalabuse,f1km0e9,t3_d9pm3p,1569537296.0,"I experienced quite similar events. My first reaction was to change my entire worldview to place less value, if any remained at all, on human relationships. This leads to selfishness, which isn't inherently bad, but it leaves out some ideas that can actually improve your life. I did this just because there were so many narcissists around me that I extended their behavior to the rest of humanity. I didn't know the extent of which other people are compassionate.

The absurdist philosophy argues that even though there might not be objective meaning in our lives or even in the existence of humanity, there still exist logical reasons to strive against this meaninglessness and seek your own subjective meaning. Yes no one will care after you die, and you probably won't be able to see everyone's reactions if your name is on a giant museum. But you will care while you're alive, if you choose to.

Following this line of thought, even though human relationships and friendships may ultimately be meaningless, temporary and provide no long term value, it's still fun to feel accepted by a group. We evolved to be social.

The very fact that there isn't any purpose actually helps us create it for ourselves. We find meaning and purpose in our lives because we are alive and we see that we won't live forever. Every moment is precious and we can use our time however we want."
