I think I was the only one she could confide in and talk to and I knew what she was going through and I blew her off. I got the call the next morning. That was over 6 years ago and not one day has passed where I haven't wondered what might have changed if I had been there to talk to her. 

Any time someone tells me it's not my fault every fiber of me screams bullshit, I know I wasn't responsible but I could have been there. 

That being said it's not your fault just like it wasn't my fault. I know that probably doesn't help.. 

As time has gone on most people have moved on and just get bummed out when I talk about her. But I find chatting with people online helps, almost like it keeps her alive in a way.

I don't really know what Im getting at here but I'd love to hear more about your friend if you ever want to talk"

That probably sounds shitty but I find comfort in it, it kind of takes some of the pressure off. I like to think life is about finding meaning in the little moments, go for a walk and pat a dog, hold your neighbors hand at church, jump in a freezing cold lake, go get a drink and talk to one random stranger.

Always push yourself to work hard and take little steps out of your comfort zone and you'll be amazed at how much meaning you can find."
