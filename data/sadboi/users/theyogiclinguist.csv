bipolar2,fkpuhd1,t1_fkmmu3l,1584419756.0,"This is really great advice! I’m going to try this. 
PS— OP, I’ve been there! This is painful. I’m so sorry you’re going through this. I’m no longer a single mom, but I still go through this.

For me- different things work. You just have to keep pushing forward. I get discouraged and say things like “I’ll never be well,” but I think the thing is— is we are well a lot of the time— our brains just won’t let us see it this way. 

***Focus on the small victories*** and celebrate them. “Oh yay! I gave my baby five whole minutes of playing with him without saying, ‘I’m sorry, Mommy’s tired.’” 
Or “yay! We did a puzzle together and I can see he’s proud that we did this together.” (Maybe write these in a journal) 
“It’s okay for the dishes to sit a little longer— I cooked a healthy dinner tonight and everyone feels better because of it!” 
“I didn’t do laundry, but I cuddled and watched TV with bebe for 30 minutes instead.” 
^^These types of small victories (where you also point out that you aren’t going to be the perfect super
Mom, but you’re going to make it your priority to make that sweet boy feel loved.” 
(I have a five year old and an 11 month old. I have to tell myself things like this because it’s easier to give the baby what little energy I have so I make sure to get in all the five minute cuddles or times that are just my special time with my five year old so she doesn’t feel like the baby gets all Mommy’s energy. (Especially when Mommy’s “not feeling well”)

Just an idea! It’s hard training, but all the healthy routines are amazing.

bipolar2,fdlvbyz,t1_fdlr1pq,1578533353.0,Oh okay. Scratch that. I am not... at all... a psychiatrist. I forget sometimes that a bunch of self-help books knowledge and a few common markers are not enough to diagnose a person with a thing. 😇
bipolar2,fdl1xqc,t1_fdkz1d3,1578515643.0,"Okay... yes, that was my prediction as well. He definitely seems a bit depressed... (to the point, I’ve asked him if he took his meds.) I always let him know right away that I need him to tell me what he’s feeling and I think a lot of the times, he just hasn’t figured it out just yet so he may not even realize that the depression has crept in. 
We stay so busy, I didn’t even know I had depression for a long time. So, instead of depression, I always thought I had terrible anxiety, physically and mentally, and I just thought all the quick, extreme depressive thoughts and reactions were a result of the anxiety. I would tell my previous therapist and psychiatrist EVERYTHING and they just kept misdiagnosing and prescribing me SSRI’s that made me worse. (They were both boomers. Don’t wanna be too ageist, but my new psychiatrist has now replaced both of them more effectively and I have only been working with her for the last three months or so). Everybody is so damn scared of that stigmatized word (BP). 
 Anyway, sorry, I always digress. Anyway, my episodes are so mixed and I tend to be high levels of both ends of the spectrum, so for a long time I didn’t know I had depression bc I had gotten so used to pushing through feeling shitty inside all the time. (If I were an armchair researcher, I would hypothesize that all the poor coping (by hiding how we felt our whole lives) and childhood trauma could have contributed to all the paranoid thoughts. (That part of the brain can only store so much!)  
 Anyway, TL; DR (always) I am careful not to *blame* my paranoid thoughts on his lack of communication. Be careful with that, if you ever find yourself phrasing it that way with your bf. I haven’t ever phrased it that way, but he constantly either worries that he’ll burden me more and he knows I am already fighting for my life as it is, or he just isn’t aware yet of his own depression therefore often needs me to help his work I through it.
I usually phrase it as... when you tell me how you’re feeling (negative or not, I might immediately get sad and cry or freak out and panic (pre-meds, at least) but in the end, we both end up benefiting from it.) 
I’ll have to have another lil’ talk with him later. ;) 
Thanks for chatting, friend."
bipolar2,fdky4tv,t1_fdkvvnu,1578513560.0,"Thank you so much for the sentiment. 

First, I didn’t look through his phone.
Second, I didn’t even remember that part (the phone violation urge) of my insomnia until I got your notification just now and reread my post (so that’s definitely a concern). 

Now, to address your question, I am very open with him about it. He’s very patient and supportive to the extent that he understands this is my disorder and not me. He also used to help me more after he read a book about relationship OCD, but lately, he just seems tired. Not unsupportive, but exhausted with all of my constant mood issues, and the fact that he’s been carrying the family quite a bit while I finish grad school research at night. 
So, last night in my likely hypomanic state I was experiencing, I told him ALL the random, unrelated paranoid delusions (as there were more than usual) I had all throughout the day. I was really more so thinking out loud and trying to work through whether or not they were contributed more to my disorder or to the fact that I just titrated off Viibryd. He barely responded, as has been the situation a lot lately. I asked him if I was upsetting him, and he said no, that he was just tired, but he also suffers (but has been in recovery for about 20 years thanks to his antidepressant) of clinical depression, so I wonder if all this stuff he seems to be feeling is more contributed to situational stresses. 
He often doesn’t tell me when he’s suffering inside because he worries that I will react, and we have to go back over that— I’m in therapy, working on med management, and no matter how I react initially, we ALWAYS end up feeling better after we’ve COMMUNICATED about it. 
That said, I usually do tell him when I have the urge to look in his phone. He even keeps a password that I can remember to help me work on exposure prevention therapy for my thoughts and urges, but I worry that if I tell him, it’ll just be added to the list of things I am still struggling with, and it makes him feel for me, feel sad for me, and I don’t want him worrying. I’ll still tell him. I gotta. (I can’t keep shit in even if I want to!) (that impulse is another of many things I’m working on) 😅

Sorry. Tl;dr 
Yes, he’s supportive and we do typically communicate about these urges, but I think he’s not communicating (bc he thinks it helps me, when actually it makes me more paranoid and suspicious) so that’s where I am. It’s time for us to talk about communication again. 

I did not give in to the urge last night though and did fall asleep!👏"

My psychiatrist told me that adderall works well with it, but it can add irritability, so there’s probably no perfect cocktail. However, if you find something close, I wanna know! My psych is of the school of thought that if it’s not making you feel about 95% -100% better, there are too many meds out there for you to feel like you have to settle for 60 or 70% happy/ content with life.
I might also do the genesight test next if the Lamotrigine isn’t the best fit."

I’m only up to 50 mg of Lamictal, so I’m sure that slight agitation/ weirdness will improve as well, but I’m tired... super tired (probably less BECAUSE of the lamictal but more because I’m not sleeping well at all, and it’s a different kind of insomnia than the manic insomnia.) I am aware, I’m avoiding any urge to get up and find something to do with my “extra time,” but super frustrated I can’t sleep. 
The small win was that I didn’t get so upset when frustrated that I either yelled at someone or sobbed, so there’s an upside! I think I just realized the lamictal is for sure doing a positive thing!

MentalHealthBuddies,fdji3mk,t3_el2d88,1578471815.0,"I had to take leave of absence once, and I simply said I was unwell. It’s nobody’s damn business. And after you’re feeling better, you can go make a life coaching YouTube like you amazing youngsters are so good at! Happy healthing. I hope you feel better as soon as necessary for your personal growth, buddy. Better to start working on it while you’re young. ✊"
funny,fdjhwxt,t3_eli4va,1578471574.0,"I mean... I just want to know though... is it fugs mugs?! I first typed “fucking mugs,” and it autocorrected to fugs? (but that typo was too goofy to edit.) I bet it TOTALLY is mugs! That pic looks like pics from my baby years... late 80’s. Also, parenting... you’re doing it right! (Bringing that one back)"
bipolar2,fdjf06p,t1_fdhpdpl,1578468022.0,"Yay! I’m glad all that “study break,” (how I justify over-explaining things while I should be writing research) helped you see how you helped a complete stranger. I’m still new to this disorder as well, as I was misdiagnosed for years. 

Yours sound really similar to mine. My patterns change constantly. I classically, have had more mixed episodes over the last year and a half or so...  but I was misdiagnosed with anxiety, ADHD, OCD aaaand wait for it— PTSD (unfortunately the PTSD is one that stuck along with ADHD 😅 (as I have sprinkled symptoms from all of those, but all of my symptoms are  every damn symptom of bipolar) 

I’m not sure what the last psychiatric nurse practitioner was doing. She even had me on Trintellix onetime, which (my current psychiatrist told me) has shown to bring about PTSD episodes and paranoia, so guess what! For the six months or so that she told me to “give it a little more time,” just like she said with the Zoloft and the Lexapro,  raising the dose slowly and steadily, I progressively became more and more debilitated until I had to leave my job. It was a hostile work environment as it were, so add all of my illness to that, and it was just a damn miserable time to be alive.
 
Then, when  I started having postpartum depression after pregnancy, off all meds, I started feeling really unwell again, but this was different. Off of all my meds and pregnancy hormones = miiiiixed épisodes bipolar x 1000! Eventually I was assigned to a new psychiatrist and she tried me out on Viibryd, but after a week or so of euphoric rose-tinted glasses, I started having bad episodes again, constantly and simultaneously. She took me right off of that because it was giving me heightened mania with paranoid delusions and major panics.

Now I’m just on day 16 of a mood stabilizer, super low baby dose, and I might be feeling some benefits, but I never really know for sure until I feel some major stability... which I don’t. 

So, TL; DR (again) I can’t say for certain because my psychiatrist has had me titrating off of an SSRI, as it’s the millionth one that didn’t work out, and exacerbated my symptoms... Today, I had (uncharacteristically) a day of what looked like hypomania. I worked diligently once I finally started but was side-tracked for hours doing nonsense— never the task at hand, so until this Viibryd is out of my system, I’m just not even sure. 🤷🏻‍♀️😣"
bipolar2,fdhkwkr,t1_fdh9m0o,1578424819.0,"Thanks for saying this. I have a professor at the end of my grad school career who seems intrigued by me and sometimes impatient at times, but since I told her I sometimes shut down after negative feedback due to debilitating mood disorder and years of shame for my moods or impulses, she started added smilies and simple positive feedback to my work. Even something as simple as “this section is OKAY,” or “you’re getting there,” helped me to stay present. It’s the little things that count. 
Listen, I’m a grown-ass woman and I hear my brain saying, “you shouldn’t need smilies to keep going,” “just do your work and quit letting people see your ‘weakness’.” These are not weaknesses! Sometimes we either give into the mania and pull all-nighters despite our better judgement hidden beneath the impulses. Again, give yourself permission to make choices, good or bad, like all other humans, and try to lean into it. My professor added a comment to my work yesterday, “I know this is how you talk, but I’d edit it, as it might be misunderstood by the reader.” First my ego said, well, fuck them! I’m leaving it!” Then I sat back, and removed the phrase. People may not always understand what we go through, but I think most of them (these days) want to support you. Keep that, alone in mind. It’s hard not to be embarrassed for outbursts. I started crying uncontrollably in the middle of a class meeting once because everyone else was turning in their research while I was still editing and feeling hopeless. Try not to fall into the resentment or self-loathing phase that I find myself in, and just try to remember— that professor probably/hopefully wants nothing more than to support you."
bipolar2,fdhit6o,t3_el6nzi,1578423545.0,"Thank you. I did need to see this. It almost made me cry bc it really hit home. I had a rough last couple of weeks, and yesterday I was unable to FITYMI (phrase,  which I truly despise using because not everyone has the debatably shitty “life skill” of “faking it,” and “leaving their personal life at the door” when they walk into work, but my job requires it. I will say that my boss is the most understanding one I’ve had in this career, but stigma is still ironically high in my profession, and the term bi-polar is met with talks of crazy people. If they knew this successful person has quietly persevered through countless years of debilitating moods and impulses that made me wonder if I had multiple personalities; and this, missed a minimal amount of work considering the constant incorrectly medicated rapid cycling, they’d scoff, they’d gasp, they’d be perplexed, but they would still see me as less competent mentally ill person.
I work with tons of people and provide services (closely) with about a large number of children per day. When I’m cycling through as low as “meh, to as high as “manic,” I’m viewed as an expert at what I do. I have skills that many people don’t l, and gifts related to empathy and intuition that emotionally “stable,” people may not possess, or may not be “impulsive enough” to be vulnerable and reveal their internalized thoughts. I think my brain “abnormalities,” contribute to these gifts. 
Due to the shame involved with my trauma, and being raised by an undiagnosed bipolar mother and sister who always told me “I just get up and keep moving,” “give yourself credit! You’re strong! You can push through!” “It’s not mental illness!” “It’s just bc you have a lot on you.” “You ARE able to stop doing that. You throw fits when things don’t go your way.” (Okay, boomer, thanks for to the disordered anti-therapy.) 
My mother always refers to mental disorders as if they’re new and overdiagnosed, and she tells me to give myself credit as if my perseverance and utter suffering should make me feel more self-worth than attributing behaviors to a brain disorder. (Again... okay, boomer.) (She is not a doctor, and has no authority on diagnosis of anything unless it came from the know-it-all file in her brain filed under “control-freak.”) My sister expresses sympathy, but still sees it as a negative. Maybe, it’s the yogi thinking in me, but I consider a lot of my moods to be special and even gifts. They are what my husband fell in love with. Recently, I was in a very low state and often regularly cycled from high to irritable to ragey to self-loathing, being hard on myself for impulses, then to extreme lows—thoughts like “my babies could be more healthy and live a more stable life without me.” They’re going to be as fucked up as I am if I don’t “get better” soon. And then when I finally give myself permission to not feel pure shame for my behaviors, I sob and feel worthless and hopeless.  I recently told my husband, “I wish I could be more like you.” He manages so much, so well and is so patient with me. He said, “I want you. I fell in love with you. I don’t want anyone else.” He constantly laughs at the humor that comes out of my lack of impulses, my clumsiness from literally walking right into things, and figuratively walking right into situations where I think I can change all the children’s lives and advocate for ALL the babies. Ah, pushing the “envelope again,” he’ll say, or “making waves again, babe?” But he appreciates that side of me even if it’s not customary to act emotionally at work. 
I’m still not in the best place. I DID just sit and write this short novel instead of the work I need to do, but my husband also appreciates the trade-off for the lows... (all the spontaneous sex, the fact that I would walk in front of a moving vehicle for my own children or the children I see at work, etc.) Even some of my closest friends and relatives who love me, love my heart, and acknowledge my success don’t really see all that amazing worth and value that my husband sees in me, or that which my children see in me. I’m so often operating under the influence years of my mother’s and stigma’s  influence, that I don’t even see the worth that my babies see or my husband sees. 

I’m getting there, but the waaay TL; DR— is that I can relate to the daily fight with my self— and the goal of staying consistently aware of my own worth."

Ugh... but I’m super jealous you’re in Denmark! It’s way cooler than the US or any Target. Never go in a Walmart. Promise me you won’t do it! It’s where adorable local markets go to die. 
(Target isn’t much better, but not as huge and disgusting, and the things and clothes are still relatively low quality, but cheap and semi-stylish.)"
bipolar2,fdfblyd,t1_fdei7qi,1578357855.0,"Same. I feel you. I can usually justify the stuff... “the girls needed Valentine’s outfits!” ... or “I needed these expensive vitamins for every member of the family and greeting cards for birthdays and holidays for the next three months!” (Cards, which I spent an hour reading and picking out instead of doing grad school work.)
But he knows half the time, the Target splurges are not a *necessity.* I tried to tell my psychiatrist that the CVS in target wasn’t a great idea. She replied, “I know I love Target too.” (I was like, “...but you do know me, right?”) 
3 out of the 5 damn times I go to pick up my five different scrips five different times a month— (don’t ask why they’re set up that way)— I spend money on clothes and other things we “need.” ...there are one or two times a month I am able to control the impulse though (small accomplishments 👏)."
bipolar,fdfaomq,t1_fdeogju,1578357242.0,"You are awesome. I have similar PTSD. It is unfortunate how common this seems to be, but it makes me feel warm fuzzies to know that so many of us have amazing husbands/ wives/ boyfriends/ girlfriends, and I hope it provides comfort rather than longing or resentment for those who don’t have this situation in their relationships. For those of you in the latter sitch, know that even the best relationships are hard work, and never insta-worthy (even if they look and sound that way) and you’ll happen upon that person eventually. Keep being amazing in the meantime. ❤️"
bipolar2,fdcsu1l,t1_fdam91e,1578283334.0,"This is cheesy, but for me, this happened until I went through yoga teacher training and “found my Self.” When I figured out myself, I no longer craved the attachement, affection, and comfort of what comes with a “relationship,” and thus, I stopped breaking hearts or getting mine broken. Eventually, in a healthy mindset, I found the love of my life (like the clichés say— when I wasn’t looking.) He’s super patient with me, and now we are happily married with two kids. It’s been an emotional roller caster because I’m late to the diagnosis party and my super crazies kicked in when some trauma stuff surfaced, so he has weathered the biggest part of the storm with me (the part where you realize you’re not just “crazy,” or overly anxious, or moody, or “emotional,” but you actually have a brain thing.) 
My tl;dr of this rambling is that— I believe, disorder or not, when you get to a place where you’re self-aware and (another cliché) love yourself despite all your moods all your faces, and all your quirks, the person who is right tends to come along eventually. It’s the self-worth part that is so hard for us because I think we tend to have behaviors that we shame ourselves for. ❤️"
