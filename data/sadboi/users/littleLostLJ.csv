SuicideWatch,f8itdxa,t1_f7tat4k,1574592354.0,"Thanks I’m in Australia haha. I have given my life caring for others. 
I have simply hit a brick wall where the care and kindness I have shown to others have made me happy. No I don’t feel anything. The only thing I care about is making my daughter happy. 

Honestly I wish I could just check out."

SuicideWatch,f7srlbd,t3_dxmc70,1573997544.0,"I’m 31 and it’s me and my daughter. 
No other family in this country and the ones overseas don’t care. I have a friend looking after my daughter next week when I go for surgery. I’ve got no one else to even go with me or be my NOK I’m embarrassed. Couldn’t even be bothered telling people about my health or problems. I’m just a empty shell 

I can’t understand what I did wrong in life to have no family. If it wasn’t for my daughter I would have checked out long ago."
SuicideWatch,f7spvsh,t3_dxlkqe,1573997130.0,"You lucky you have family and a partner. I envy people who have family. 
I’m going to have surgery next week and I don’t even have anyone to take me or even put down as a next of kin. I have a friend watching my daughter and I lied and said I have someone going with me. Zero family here and the ones overseas don’t even care. 
Couldn’t even care to tell people about my health. 

Feel like putting done in big red letters NOT for resuscitation."
