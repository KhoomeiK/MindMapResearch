And if it was a deal breaker I'd rather know early on.  I'm a Big Boy™ and can handle rejection, but being dumped when I'm much more emotionally invested is harder. So she had ample warning. 

My thinking is if they know what I'm struggling with it's easier for them to see why I do the things I do. They may be more understanding of my ""quirks"". I'm not the asshole that ghosts them for a week for no reason. I'm the guy who says ""Hey, I'm not doing so good right now so I may be a bit hard to get hold of for a while."" 

My experience is that most people (not only romantic partners) are very understanding if you open up about it. Some people know very little. Those are usually quite inquisitive and you can explain it to them. Some people are a little misinformed. You can explain to them to, but it's harder. Then there are always some hugely misinformed and biased assholes, but you don't want to be with them anyways. Some people have friends or loved ones with their own struggles. Those can go either way.

I was lucky. After I told her my GF started researching it on her own. And not just from movies and stuff. More from like actual sites on BP. She had a lot of questions which I answered to the best of my abilities.
