If he is concerned and offers to help by keeping him away or giving you tips on how to avoid him then see how that plays out. If that doesn't work, or if your friend doesn't find it to be that serious then leave. In the meantime, because I know it can take time to build up the courage, look for other places ro live, just in case and try to stay in your friends room, with the door locked as much as you can."

Maybe it's just based on memory, because my mom's happened years later(like 20) so maybe she had a hard time remembering because I know sometimes our brains get stuck."
Dreams,flo2v40,t3_fq083o,1585330599.0,"Maybe it's because your dreaming mind is trying to imagine her deceased or as a ghost but doesn't know what she would look like in that state so it just makes her seem faceless, and maybe the dark is symbolic for depression. I'm not sure, this is just a guess.

My mom had a dream that our deceased cousin was roaming around a hotel, she(mom) kept call out to her but she never responded. My mom finally caught up and tapped her shoulder, when she turned around she had no face. I'm thinking maybe it's a deceased thing, like we can't imagine how they would look in that state so it just stays blank. She died in a motorcycle accident for clarification."

Counting them as a whole. Fortunately we all have didn't ways of going about things. They shouldn't ever dismiss other's feelings or be prejudice or discriminate against anyone for any reason. That is not only damaging and insensitive but it does kind of damage the view of the Christian community. A lot of it is very confusing, but at the end of the day I guess it's just the way we perceive the Word. Because I know a lot of people whom have read the same scripture as me but have gotten a completely different meaning from it. I try to keep an open mind because I'm not always going to get it right away. Sorry if my English is bad btw."

Meaning I won't see him for graduation or the 10 days after. Then they are putting off any deployments and traveling. Meaning he won't get to go to tech school right away. He will have to stay in TX until they get the go ahead. Once they can go, he'll go to Tech school for 6mos and then will get stationed somewhere. So I won't get to see him until after then.

Advice,fkmrtlm,t1_fkmqywj,1584337693.0,"I get a little confused on that too, but there's a whole section in the Bible that talks about the events leading up to Revelation. These other hardships and challenges are just tests of our Faith. We need to follow through with everything. Take everything serious but don't fear the Revelation. God created us with many aspects, fear not being one of them. Never fear, just be Faithful and don't take it as a joke of course. I don't know when the end will come, time wise I mean, but there will be warnings and it will (from what I've learned) take many many years to fully develop into revelation. The events could even develop over a duration longer than a lifetime. I don't know everything but I have testimonies that have shown God's love for us and I will always have Faith in Him and be forever grateful for them . All I know is to have Faith, not fear and do not be insensitive to the things(like the virus)/people around us."
