You and stacy can help support each other. But you both really should find therapy if you can for healing and processing.


As far as the threat, try to get him to text it to you... so you can show the police and file your reports, and emphasize your sister will need protection. you staying with him will make it worse. You are not safe. What if he does it again? You need outside help like law enforcement.  Have you told your family? Since you're under age."

This makes me so angry. I'm sorry you and your friend went through this.

This prob belongs in another sub.. but anyways, you can only do so much to help someone else. You can't ever force someone. They have to do it willingly. You can encourage and try to help them.

rape,fp47qq6,t1_fp466r5,1588293376.0,Oh sorry I misunderstood.  What fetish are you referring to?
rape,fp44wp4,t1_fp3wdz6,1588291750.0,"I kinda understand what you're saying in regards to your kink that you have. I was literaly just thinking about this... I wonder if the need to revictimize ourselves , re create the trauma, is  to close ""the loop"". And that's why we continue the cycle until it closes because with humans we need to close the loop. Some psychology i learned yesterday about loops, completely different topic, but still I thought it might be related."
rapecounseling,fp44f9k,t1_fp3mwhj,1588291474.0,"Ok! Just making sure. It's funny because someone posted literally the same thing you wrote in this post,  a few weeks ago and people got really angry at the poster,  bullying and send them hate and threats. Hopefully you are not receiving that."
rape,fp4435f,t3_gb6tpt,1588291284.0,I still have gifts that he gave me too. Idk why. It's almost like I cant let go. But I think I have some desire now to want to let go. So I'm thinking of giving them away when quarantine is over. If your therapist shares something insightful about this please do share!
rapecounseling,fp3mi5l,t3_gb3oga,1588281923.0,"It's okay. People can post and tell us what happened and ask if it was or wasnt. That's why we are here.  Yes, youre right, what you're saying makes sense. Most posts are describing assault, with a few that were not but still traumatizing which does not take away what they went through internally. But it's not the point, there is a lot of emotion mixed in. People want validation. And that's completely  fine.  You know for a fact most people who asked that on here already googled the definitions and tried to read other stories, but cant grasp their own experiences."
adultsurvivors,fp141ov,t1_foy2ajp,1588223820.0,Does she remember? Or still think it was normal/okay?
adultsurvivors,fp13zyw,t1_foxnuin,1588223783.0,Possibly.  But don't you realize when you're an adult?  Yeah I dont remember much but I feel weird thinking about their family.
rape,fozuqon,t3_gagz8e,1588197211.0,Yes same here.. I'm so sorry ): it hurts alot to be invalidated.
rapecounseling,fox1z84,t1_fowowgn,1588132172.0,Ehh he probably cried as a manipulative tactic.  My ex did that.
GHB_info,fovxfyo,t1_foquij4,1588109222.0,"Thank you!! I asked a few others but they didnt experience the headache, or whispers feeling good,l.

When you OD what happened?"
rapecounseling,fovwzkd,t3_g9vfss,1588108991.0,"I'm sorry. That's so upsetting. It's honestly the entire system ): the reality of it is there are many rape kits on back log front years ago... it's horrible. 
But they should have already checked surveillance and spoke with the club owners and managers and staff. I feel like they should have told you to do a kit because it would be evidence that they injured you enough to bleed. In my state it is one of the offenses. 
Do you remember how you got home? Was it an uber? Can you check on your phone to backtrack to where it was? 
I hope you're okay, always praying for you💛."
