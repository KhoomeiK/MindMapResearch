climatechange,fqpwxd6,t1_fqpuh5v,1589555477.0,"The automobile industry isn’t going anywhere, and what reason would ecologists have to want it to disappear anyway? Most people are going about their lives as normal despite the warnings of scientists.

The more logical explanation is that people use cars and gas and oil because they need to go to work and make money. And the fossil fuels industry wants them to keep doing that so they can continue making money. And you are believing the lies of the fossil fuels industry because the reality of climate change would be too much for you to handle.

Other people are accepting the facts even though they might be afraid of what it means for the future. If I were you, I would not be able to live with my own cringe as a furry-porn-loving coward who is too scared to accept the fact that climate change is real."
climatechange,fqpvrmc,t1_fqpuh5v,1589554871.0,Have you ever considered that you might be brainwashed? Why do you believe some facts and not others? Why do you think that ecologists are wrong? Is it perhaps that you are the one who doesn’t want to admit to being brainwashed?
SuicideWatch,fqhk0q2,t1_fqec3qu,1589378536.0,"I am glad to have stumbled across your post:) Beautifully said.

When taken together, the sum of life’s realities and misfortunes become a painful burden to the mind. Reality hurts. Sometimes the brain would rather let go and disassociate and it is a relief. I think about this because I struggle with being schizophrenic, although rather high-functioning. When I was younger, I had these long-form quiet delusions that I kept to myself, and nothing hurt more than realizing none of it was true or would ever happen. 

Lately, due to an uptick in suicidal ideation that has impacted my studies and brought me great shame, I’ve been wondering why depression is seen as something to be worked through, rather than a potentially debilitating state requiring immediate care and attention. If someone’s family member dies, we know that their mental state will be in disarray. We acknowledge that emotional pain is a normal human experience that can affect one’s ability to function. Why, then, is it such a stretch to think that the brain could consistently misfire pain or be “stuck” in a depressive mode until living itself starts to feel unbearable, futile?

I hope that you’re able to care for yourself and find others who care for you in turn. And if you ever would like to, feel free to PM me.:)"

I totally understand you and I struggle with the exact same thing. The US is a high-key a hyper-capitalistic shithole that has no problem eating the poor and mentally ill alive and justifying it as being their fault for experiencing poverty or trauma in the first place. We are dehumanized to the point where it seems that all of society agrees that we are simply broken or lazy.

It is exhausting to battle an invisible assailant that no one else can see. You feel its hands squeezing your throat, but even people who see you choking don’t seem to care. You start to doubt yourself and your experience. You torture yourself for not being who you wish that you were, but it was never your fault. 

If you look at the data, it is astounding how many people live in poverty, don’t expect to be able to retire, live paycheck-to-paycheck, go broke from contracting a treatable modern illness, have no real wealth, or are struggling under massive debt. 

We do have some agency in life, but you can’t change the chemical makeup of your brain. And I  know for damn sure I never asked someone to call me into existence so that I could work 8-hour shifts every fucking day. 

You are doing great as long as you keep sight of what’s important and VALUE YOURSELF the way society is unable to.

Sorry if this was rant-y or cheesy, but I feel exactly the same as you and it sucks so bad! I don’t want anyone else to feel that way"
SuicideWatch,fqe0qtg,t3_gi5zui,1589299856.0,"You’re not a burden. I honestly feel that the modern world is toxic. We are social beings that are meant to support one another and have ample time to just rest and do nothing. It is a sad, sad state of being when we can no longer rely on others to support us. But you are not alone or broken or weird or bad for needing support. That is entirely natural and perfectly human."
SuicideWatch,fqdn22v,t3_gi7nn9,1589292994.0,"No! Don’t do it. It isn’t worth it, and you don’t have to kill yourself to show that your struggles are real. They are. It is a medical condition that requires treatment: you are not crazy. I know that it hurts to exist, but you will find your people someday.

If you need help or want to talk, please message me."
SuicideWatch,fqdlu7l,t3_gi5zui,1589292326.0,"I think that we get stuck in patterns that feel comfortable to us. If you’ve experienced sustained trauma as a developing child, it’s likely that you are stuck in negative coping mechanisms.

I also have the problem of self-sabotage and bringing pain upon myself. The issue is that it is neither as bad as you want it to be, nor as good as you wish it could be. People are meh. They can be disappointing, or asshole-ish. Most aren’t totally evil, though. And there are also some people with kind, pure hearts.

You will be okay. I’m sorry that you don’t have anyone you feel you can trust talking to... But broken people with good hearts find each other. I found my other half:) and he actually stayed with me and has been loyal through everything. 

It’s important not to make the people who are trying to help you out to be monsters, but you probably learned from experience that not everyone can be trusted. Sometimes paranoia about the intention of others is a normal response to things that have happened to us before."
SuicideWatch,fqdkm6n,t1_fqchqqk,1589291641.0,"No, you don’t deserve to die. Unfortunately we live in a culture of cancellation that likes to perform “goodness” and “worthiness.”

You are not less of a valuable person if you simply have abstract desires that might be considered weird or creepy. You are something outside of that as well. You are a complex person, and it’s obvious that you feel very deeply and therefore likely also have a good heart. Bad people don’t feel guilty. 

Sometimes you can’t help what passes through your brain. But if you fixate on it and stay ashamed, it will kill you. Don’t let it. We all have demons that live inside us that we need to face."
SuicideWatch,fqdjkey,t3_ghjgnt,1589291036.0,"I am schizophrenic and my mother has BPD. We’ve had a lot of ups and downs, but as I grew into adulthood I realized how difficult it must have been for her to try to care for four children as well as herself. She did her best. Now my mom is my biggest support and one of my main reasons for trudging along... I know that she would never be the same if I died, let alone committed suicide.

I know it hurts. I know. One thing that has helped me is accepting that my mental illness is a real: it is a chemical imbalance in the brain, as well as the result of severe childhood trauma. Living in a toxic world that rejects rest and praises grinding yourself to the bone for abstract notions of success is essentially like trying to make it through a marathon on a broken leg. We need extra love and rest.

The shame of it and feeling broken makes everything so much worse... you are not broken. You are not worse than other people. The struggles that you face, others face as well. And you will make it through. Remember that you need to keep your stress levels low, regularly check in with and care for yourself, and accept what has happened in the past or that you cannot change."
SuicideWatch,fqdi93h,t3_gi3bbc,1589290245.0,"I understand how you feel, but this is the internet... it’s an outlet and a veil for predators who may never be brought to justice. Everyone has the capacity to disappoint and hurt you to a certain extent, but some sick fucks really lean into emotional manipulating vulnerable people for personal gain and THAT is the lowest state of being. Your experiences are valid and depression is awful... don’t let a few gross people get to you. They don’t even deserve anger. Only pity and rejection."
SuicideWatch,fqdh9y1,t3_ghzz1a,1589289640.0,"I often have the same feeling. But, a lot of the people who are thriving do so by chance. Many people struggle, falter, and fail. Many people are struggling to cope. The world is NOT an easy place to inhabit and your feelings are normal. What has sometimes helped me is cutting out non-essential stressors in my life and opening up about my feelings with the few people I can sort of trust."
