I watched Joker and thought it was discomforting and painful to watch and I wasn't used to it. It made Joker pathetic and broken but in a way that the movie helped me to understand and even relate to. It was a traumatizing film but I think for the right reason. I think ""harrowing"" is the right word. 

Even though I respect its message I still found issue with it in relation to the Batman canon and think Joker acted more as a highly visible vehicle for a message about mental health than as the true character from the franchise. In that way watching the Joker was a bit dissatisfying but on the other hand I am glad that people saw the film who otherwise probably wouldn't have. As a Joker film I personally felt that the movie needed more of the Batman series's kitsch element and more of its humor and theatrics and entertainment value. But as psychological study I think it worked well as is. Maybe it was still too much of a reach though, trying to turn Joaquin's character into a cartoon villain.

If you liked Joker I think Joaquin Pheonix's other film You Were Never Really Here is a similar type of character."

When I felt my most useless self after being unemployed a long time, I began commenting here so I could at least feel a bit useful. 

Children can be selfish and uncaring. Sometimes time goes on just because of life. Don't let something like your son not speaking to you drive you to suicide. Something like a messy house shouldn't make you kill yourself either. Realize that what you're feeling is a bunch of segments of unhappy situations strung together and they can each be dealt with in time.

SuicideWatch,fe0tht3,t3_enk8c0,1578818484.0,"You have some good food for thought here.

I think this space (r/suicidewatch) can exacerbate a sense of imprisonment in a life of agony. I don't think it's meant to. But lots of people post here--the long time, chronically depressed, the very young (even as young as twelve years old), the overworked, the grieving who grieve the loss of a friend or family member or the end of a relationship, etc. Even if someone gives a big synopsis of their life and its conflicts, you still don't really know. In my opinion, people here aren't equipped at all to talk you out of suicide, even though we may relate and may have gone through similar troubles as you. It is up to you. But perhaps someone here may have an experience that could be helpful. To me, that is what this space could be for.

But we are even more unequipped to support your decision to commit suicide. That is entirely irresponsible especially as strangers on the internet. The stickied post mentions about ""covert incitement"" and even though I think many of want to resonate about our honest feelings and shared unhappiness, it is important to do so in a way that doesn't push you towards the most extreme option when there might be less extreme solutions available.

A therapist will help you understand that it doesn't have to overshadow all the rest.

I'm back on track with my loan and don't want to fuck up again. I also recognize now my mental health problems are pretty severe and I need help. I want to work on that too. Thanks for your reassurances, advice and motivation."
SuicideWatch,f8rii1j,t1_f8rfqra,1574741316.0,Can you ask them to refer you to someone else? Could that help? I've heard that a therapist change could make a difference. I'm not really one to talk though.
SuicideWatch,f8rfohj,t3_e1rufw,1574739213.0,"I don't fucking know what to say. 

You have antidepressants--does that mean you have a therapist? 

Why hasn't therapy been helping? What do you think might make therapy better?"
SuicideWatch,f7r7uhz,t3_dxixl7,1573976393.0,I getcha. These feelings suck.
SuicideWatch,f7r1ca3,t3_dxj572,1573973093.0,Does it feel good to hate and rage? I've heard that these feelings at least beat depression. Do you have any way of channeling your emotions? Does writing help?
SuicideWatch,f77hi7r,t3_duoi38,1573456952.0,"I'm sorry you've gone through so much. 

Have you ever visited the sub r/unsentletters ? It sounds like you have a lot to say. I recommend a letter to each of the groups you mentioned (your crush, friends, parents, mother, etc)."
SuicideWatch,f6ozpyu,t1_f6ho72v,1573042624.0,"I appreciate it, really. 
Same to you."
SuicideWatch,f6ho49y,t3_drf1mn,1572858433.0,"Same for me. I was thinking life was pointless, but then I heard a metal song and it gave me some enjoyment. I think it's rad people make metal music."
SuicideWatch,f6ho34v,t1_f6e0t53,1572858379.0,You seem to have a healthy mindset about it actually. Thanks for responding. I was at a low point yesterday. I appreciate your kind words.
SuicideWatch,f6ho1tm,t1_f6b9rn5,1572858315.0,Thank you very much for your kind thoughts. Same to you as well.
SuicideWatch,f6b3ea6,t3_dqxcra,1572767523.0,I relate
SuicideWatch,f6b30m3,t1_f6b0u1v,1572767336.0,"I see. No worries. Just wondering, and I realize this might sound stupid, but have you brought this up with your therapist? Maybe they might be able to recommend something else besides therapy for you to do. I really don't think talk therapy anyway is for everyone. Maybe they can walk you through some options."
