DecidingToBeBetter,fljn65v,t1_fliz3x3,1585219707.0,"I see.. you can't do much now. I'm in a similar situation (also 22f), I'm at my parents house, because of the coronavirus, with my siblings and we hear them arguing a lot. Try to accept the situation and try to isolate yourself somehow (idk use headphones, that's what I do most of the time). I hope you'll get in the professional school, good luck :)"
DecidingToBeBetter,flib2xl,t3_foz9m0,1585178848.0,"Damn, I'm sorry to hear this. I think you simply have to work on yourself. Meditation helped me a lot with several problems (depression, insecurities, jealousy and anger too). I would suggest you to try it, and be patient. Maybe you also need to talk about your family problems to a psychologist, someone that really can give you good advices and help you. Old problem always come back if you don't solve them."

studying,fbd8s00,t3_ecq6m1,1576752666.0,"Only when I do math/exercises I can listen to music (metal). If I have to study or read I need absolute silence. I've read somewhere that listening to repetitive type of music or sound can help you focus because after a while it kinda isolates you, but I still didn't try that"

I like a bit of everything but nothing that I really love doing/studying. I took a gap year to understand what I really want. I started business and management in English (I live in italy) and the first year was great. But now I feel like I'm changing my mind again. I wish I knew what it's good for me"

mentalhealth,f84b71d,t3_dyr6lw,1574239119.0,"That was just a really stupid person but I understand you. After I healed from depression in high school, my ex best friend literally said to me that she thought I didn't have any problem and I was faking it to get attention.. That hurt me a lot but I just decided to cut her out of my life. Some people are not empathetic or smart enough to understand"
depression,f7nglpr,t3_dx2la6,1573902369.0,"Try mindfulness. When I had depression in high school it helped me a lot. In general during meditation you have to be aware of everything in the present, so give it a try"
