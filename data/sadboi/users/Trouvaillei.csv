My mom encourages me to use the toilet or something while she's in the shower, etc.. she's pretty ok with being half naked in front of me and my sisters.. for a while they kept telling me it's not necessary to lock the door when I'm in the bathroom, etc.. I could go on. It's definitely not as bad as most of the stories here though. My sisters are adults and I'm 17."
mentalhealth,fqyttye,t3_glf7jj,1589754449.0,"I've been feeling the same lately. It feels like I'm in an in between, between depressed and not depressed, and I just can't make the jump to not depressed. I don't feel the heavy weight that's so familiar to me, the one that I'm sure is depression. But I don't feel okay either. I feel like I'm too taxed to care about much, and I just need a break from the world to recover. It's just a lack of energy and motivation that's easily confused with laziness."
socialanxiety,fqyqj5p,t3_gljemy,1589752892.0,"Yeah, especially when I probably already know what I have to do or what I did wrong and I just need someone's reassurance to give me the energy to actually do that."

I don't wanna interrupt them if they're having a convo. What if my voice starts shaking and I'll embarrass myself? Oh get a grip, it's just a greeting. It's easy. Just say it-- you know what, I'm gonna pretend I'm invisible. Unless they talk to me, in which case I'll have to deal with the following panic attack."" Anxiety is ridiculous.. on some days I'm better, but on bad days it's hard to even initiate a simple ""hello"" to someone."
mentalhealth,fpht65r,t1_fph7rup,1588627346.0,"Don't know if this will help you, but it helped me. Find something to do that really pushes you physically, and that you look forward to, something to improve upon. I started going out and climbing trees (there's actually studies saying climbing trees makes us happier) and other stuff, and silly as that may sound, it does help me not fall into the same deep depression I've been in. It's not an instant fix and it took a while to find out what I enjoy doing, and I had to push through many days where I felt like not working out or anything, but I forced myself to do it anyways.. even if I felt like I was just going through the motions, numb. It doesn't work for everyone, but it's worth a try.. Look for something YOU enjoy, while also pushing yourself.

I used to be very depressed, anxiety was one of the things that pushed me to be depressed. But now that I have some things to hold onto, I don't fall into that depression anymore, although I still have severe anxiety."

Tbh if we depend on outside circumstances to be happy, we never will be."
sleep,fosknxv,t3_g9bl47,1588032592.0,"A few humble suggestions I got:
1. The dehumidifier, like you said. Especially if you live in a humid place. There might be mold(?) somewhere and that could be really bad for your health.

2. A fan to help circulate the air in the room, and keep the door to your room open for at least a couple hours a day while the fan is running.

3. Clean your carpeted floors with some sort of floor cleaner. Spray it well all over your floor and you could also vacuum it afterwards. Carpeted floors can hold so much dust and dirt in them that could affect your health and sleep. The house gets noticeably less stuffy when we do this.

4. Essential oils can help a lot by helping you sleep and detoxifying the room more naturally. Try using essential oils mixed with water in a spray bottle and spray the whole room with it, your mattress, the pillow you sleep on, etc. A few oils I've used are lavender (to calm you down for sleep) eucalyptus, peppermint, and tea tree (to detoxify and help with allergies too) maybe even add some lemon essential oil. The added benefit is your room will smell great. They can be pretty expensive though, but you can find slightly less-quality and cheaper ones (but still works, just don't use those internally) at stores or online.

Hopefully these will help a bit."

mentalhealth,fo5dmvq,t3_g5ir1i,1587523141.0,"Hey, I'm kind of late but there's this app that really helped me, and I thought it could help you too. It's called ""Dare: break free from anxiety"" it walks you through different coping mechanisms and teaches you how to basically let anxiety pass through your head like a passing thought, and it has helped me so much.

And maybe take some time to rest and relax when you feel like the anxiety is getting to much to bear, if possible. Don't self destruct, it's gonna be okay. Find things you like doing that you can do at the end of the day to release some of that stress."
socialanxiety,fo0xt9t,t1_fo0vd1q,1587421803.0,"No, I get your point and I do agree theres alot of cases where people are actually being nice and trying to help, and while its annoying in the moment when people give bad advice, we cant really expect them to just know what to say, and I dont blame someone for genuinely not understanding how to help.  


That said, there are also people that are genuinely just rude and demeaning about it, and look down on you for having a mental illness that wont be fixed by ""just calm down"", like we're the ones ruining the atmosphere for having a panic attack and not smiling through it."
socialanxiety,fo0mfwm,t1_fo0hshp,1587415757.0,"The anxiety itself doesn't help you, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying the coping strategies you learn and the resilience you form from dealing with anxiety can help. But that's if and when we learn to actually overcome anxiety, not while we still don't know how to deal with it. Overcoming anxiety can make you stronger, if that makes any sense..

For example, if we overcome anxiety and learn to deal with it once, than we know we can deal with something similar again, like some people may not have experienced this much stress, but we have, so now we can deal with the same amount of stress better than someone else who has never felt that amount of stress before. But like I said, that's if we learn how to stop overthinking, learn coping mechanisms, and eventually overcome anxiety.

Sorry for rambling there, hoping something in there will make sense, lol."
socialanxiety,fo0glnw,t1_fo0fkha,1587412764.0,"Ah okay, yeah that makes sense. I misunderstood, but in that case I get mad at that aswell. It sucks that people don't realize that it doesn't work like that."

socialanxiety,fo0eepg,t1_fo0brwj,1587411589.0,"Ahh.. I've said that to people before.. and I have social anxiety aswell.. oops. For me I say it to sort of try to focus the person on something else, like breathing, in hopes that it'll either distract the person from anxiety, or for me I feel like it helps me realize ""I'm still breathing, I'm okay, I'll survive""

I guess tone of voice would matter here though."
socialanxiety,fo0e2gu,t1_fo07ikw,1587411368.0,"Then again, over time we do tend to learn how to cope with it, and fighting anxiety might make us more resilient to other difficulties in life because of the things anxiety makes us learn in order to overcome it. Or something like that."
socialanxiety,fo0dr5e,t1_fo03wfu,1587411169.0,"And then there's the people who try to be ""helpful"" but actually don't put in any effort to it and they just ""help"" so they don't appear like a jerk."

I also have depression and anxiety, though I haven't really been to a psychologist..  my parents don't agree with the whole going to a pschycologist thing either, and while I also don't want pills personally it would be nice to get a diagnosis, or go to therapy for a bit.. I've stopped trying to convince my parents of that, though. It's so hard. I try to avoid getting so anxious that I pass over the threshold to dissociation, but most times I don't have the opportunity to escape the anxiety-inducing situation, and it sucks feeling me slowly drifting away, and not being able to do anything about it but accept it and try to use it as a shield, like it's apparently ment to be.
