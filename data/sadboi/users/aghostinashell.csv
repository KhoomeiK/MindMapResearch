exmormon,fpquvea,t1_fpqdqgo,1588832928.0,"TBH I was so freaked out by my first temple experience that I was on the verge of leaving.  Unfortunately i was undiagnosed with Bipolar Disorder at the time and was convinced that god had spoken to me. So despite the inconsistencies and downright cult stuff i saw, i was sure I was doing what god wanted me to. Im sure thats not true for most TBMs, but thats my story at least."

Anxietyhelp,fp6ej9n,t3_gbl2qy,1588350974.0,"I recently had a major anxiety attack at work brought on by many triggers. It was bad enough that they sent me home. I was incredibly upset. I didn't cry until they told me to leave, for my own good I might add. I was so upset that I was still being affected by this and wanting to be ""normal"". Then I remember that I am practicing radical acceptance. This is my lot. Next time I will pay better attention to my body and feelings. Recognize the triggers and the beginnings of a problem and do my best to work with them. It is not easy or fun. It is worthwhile though."
religion,fp6e44s,t3_gb80l2,1588350768.0,"Well, it really depends on your view and perhaps even understanding of the verse ""Thou shalt have no other gods before me."" Some modern Christians believe this is in reference to things like money, work, or other things you put before a professed duty to god, but in ancient times there were many gods of many peoples. The Egyptians, the Romans, and Hindus to name a few. So the fact that someone lost their faith over meeting a different believer of a different faith just shows a lack of perspective. As an atheist I don't deny the possibility of god or gods, I myself have not seen sufficient enough evidence to argue for them. I don't deny the possibility of any theories on existence, from the Egg theory to reincarnation. I just simply don't profess to know that any of them are the one and only truth."
exmormon,fp6c1k9,t3_gbapau,1588349751.0,Cheers!!! Enjoy the freedom that comes outside of a cult!!

exmormon,fmq26to,t3_fwm56j,1586291519.0,Well the figure that JS identified as god in fascimile 2 is actually an egyptian fertility god (at least from what I've read). So yeah the mormon god does probably enjoy watching you wank.

exmormon,flykkxz,t3_frxiaq,1585603898.0,The blood oaths in the temple that were conviently written out and never spoken of again after 1990.
exmormon,flykf0v,t3_fryb0r,1585603809.0,"In other words, GC is so boring and pointless that god is making millions suffer and tens of thousands (as of now) die so that people will watch it. Actually yeah that sounds right on brand for their god."

exmormon,fh7kir1,t3_f1jny4,1581336060.0,"After my first time though the temple my only thought was ""this either has to be true, or all of these people are fucking crazy and this is a cult."" Unfortunately I leaned into the former for years. Glad to be outnow honestly. I wish I had some advice or helpful stuff, but I don't. At the very least you are not alone. I hope you can come up with an exit strategy. 

Also as someone who has a crazy mother, I have learned that I have to live my life despite her threats. It is hard, and it hurts like hell cause I love my mom, but you can't live for other people. 

I wish you the best of luck on whatever course you decide."

exmormon,fgx1isd,t1_fgv6356,1581168052.0,"Right? Like after reading how the temple was before 1990, all I could think of was the gadianton robbers. Like it literally said ""secercy"" throughout it. What. The. Actual. Fuck."
exmormon,fgv5ywy,t3_f0ihrw,1581138125.0,That and the blood oaths that were conveniently written out of the temple ritual in 1990.

exmormon,fexbymg,t3_equioz,1579428353.0,"And that is okay. A lot of emotions are going to come your way. Let then come, process them, accept them, because than when the wave has passed and the waters have settled you can see land again. You will know what is best. Talk about this with your partner when the emotions aren't so raw. If you trust that they are there to help you and you help them. All will work out.

politics,fcsm0tc,t3_eikuz6,1577919395.0,"Because lets give more power to the state. Why don't we let the government run every aspect of our lives? I mean, I personally love every trip to the DMV and I love using the postal system! My mail is never late or just doesn't show up with no response. And hey, I may have to wait 1 year and half to see a doctor for something minor, but hey at least it is free, right? Government has never overstepped its boundaries and started killing its citizens because 20 years ago the people said they wanted them to have complete power. Disarm the people, feed them the chemicals, hate and kill each other because of shit that won't matter in 100 years. But yeah sure, socialism is fucking awesome."
