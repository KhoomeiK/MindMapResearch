11:30 at night at a traffic light, otherwise quiet night and the intersection is call, suddenly heard an engine from behind and to my right as a friend and I cross with our light.
I instinctively grab him halfway across and yank him back by the shoulder, the speeding truck that whipped around and through that red light, nearly clipped him even having pulled him back significantly.

Even further back: at a teenage group building outing where they took a bunch of blind/legally blind kids to recreational park/area, one exercise was to climb 40 ft up and cross a suspended tree trunk supported/secured between two other trees and freefall in a harness.
The group split into 2, another group moving on to a ""swing"" that went out over a considerable drop-off/cliff leaving 1 guide with each group. 
The guide in my group being a 5'6 skinny little guy I stood directly behind as I watched a progression of kids trust him, two of the group being about the same height and twice the weight as him (one was me) I watched as the other big kid climbs up, in the harness, gets to the middle and as he steps off the trunk I watched the weight shift and the guides feet leave the ground.
I lurched out and grabbed him by his harness, and held him to the ground.
The kids feet touched ground and that guide turned around to look me in the eyes with fear and shock as he barely got a thank you out."

I had confidence in one and had talked to a friend and his husband (my best & closest friends at the time) about it, and the friend made jokes about it in front of people who mercilessly tease, or in front of those who have absolutely no business knowing. Including one person that the friend was fully aware I couldn't stand because of his mockery and demeaning attitude. This friend ""let it slip"" at least 3 times. 

So while I can't compare or equate my experience to yours, I can assure you this is distinctly a problem for men as well.

Much of a man's self worth in our many people of our generation and older is tied to a man's ""achievements"" in bed,

They call it ""becoming a man""...think of the logic and what that implies...you can't be a man if you're a virgin. 

This becomes a trap that hurts women as much as it does men because it makes women an easy target to pick as a source of many a virgins desperation, anger, and shame.  Then comes the InCel crap.

I don't blame women for my virginity. 

I blame my baggage. I blame me for not overcoming my baggage. 

I accept that the state of power between men and women has been so fucked for so long that in many cases men and women are trained to have a taste for shitty behavior and shitty people.

Of course...I've given up altogether on the prospect of intimacy, love, or sex... So good luck. Go have some fun, try to find someone, and try to not have to much expectation. Just be there to have fun and learn what you like, so you can look for that."

That's easy. Problems present themselves. Whereas the good things we have, find comforting, like, want, and the great thing you are really looking for: Driven purpose...

These are much easier to take for granted or much more subtle. They don't present themselves, you discover them, you experience new things, and learn the new things you like, until they're old things you like. 

The more you learn and experience with an open mind and positivity the more you will want to learn and experience and then you WILL find your passion.
