mentalhealth,fkn9ce9,t3_fjebrk,1584358875.0,"Made same decision about a year ago. I drank heavily in college and it messed up my grades, after that I stopped drinking so much, but still had my fair share of drinks on the weekend and it always left me feeling emotionally hungover (regardless of how much I had drank the night before). Last year I decided to stop altogether. My advice: don‚Äôt beat yourself up if you find yourself relapsing into drinking at difficult times. We‚Äôre human and it happens. Every day is a new day and what happened in the past doesn‚Äôt matter. Keep at it!"
cancer,fj41j18,t3_f9d0ab,1582998143.0,Thanks for all the advise! I got the magic mouthwash but I only take it for severe pain since it completely numbs my mouth. And the rest of the time I gargle some salt water which helps a lot! It‚Äôs definitely gotten much better as my immune system recovers. Hoping this will only happen the couple of days right after chemo

sexual_assault,ffgest7,t3_eth8xa,1579904630.0,"Not your fault. At all. Even if you had sex with him or made out with him hundreds of times before, that does not entitle him to your body. Lack of the word ‚ÄúNo‚Äù does not mean ‚ÄúYes‚Äù. 
For three years this was my relationship with my ex and I never saw it as rape or assault until I drilled the above message into my head. 
Remember: it is not on the victim to no get assaulted, it is on the perpetrator to not assault. 
Your boyfriend needs to educate himself on consent and always make sure anything he does with you is a 100% YES!  
Also, to anyone that says ‚Äúit‚Äôs not always easy to tell when someone doesn‚Äôt want it if they don‚Äôt explicitly say no‚Äù that‚Äôs BS. Personally if I was making out with someone and they were not moving at all or showing any form of attraction towards me (reciprocating hand movements, sounds, etc), that would be a complete turn off to begin with because I‚Äôd want the person to be as enthusiastic about it as I am. Anything else just feels wrong. 
You are not at fault. Your BF violated you and he needs to change his behavior immediately. 

Sorry for the rant, I just hate when men (or anyone) feel that they have a right to our bodies 24/7. It‚Äôs toxic and so so damaging."

mentalhealth,fesnokp,t1_feptlon,1579367174.0,Then fuck them. A human being shouldn‚Äôt be someone you have to ‚Äúdeal‚Äù with. You deserve better people around you.
mentalhealth,fep0bd2,t3_eq6l48,1579309286.0,"Same. I‚Äôm learning not to be ashamed of my diagnosis so whenever I do comment on it it‚Äôs usually a really quick  off-hand comment or I use humor to lessen the presumed seriousness of it and move on from subject. Most people are just not informed on what a mental illness is and assume the worst or simply don‚Äôt know how to react. 
That way I feel I‚Äôm being honest but not putting too much on people too soon. It‚Äôs human nature to be afraid of something you know nothing about and I don‚Äôt want to hold it against everyone. I‚Äôve found that a couple of friends have stepped up and have become people I can truly count on and then there are those that I just don‚Äôt count on in that way but are friends none the less. 
Therapy and support groups are where I go for real support and help."
travel,fem3c88,t1_felsvt7,1579238381.0,Thanks!! Will look into it now

cancer,fcm4a4n,t1_fcl81qk,1577763861.0,"Doctors think it‚Äôs a cyst or mass of tissue that was formed after the surgery that for some reason moved and is pressing against my urethra and sort of blocking my kidney causing it to swell. Horrible pain from it but just got some medication for it. Tomorrow we‚Äôll meet with a urologist to see what the best move forward is. 
Thank you all so much for the help. We ended up cancelling the cruise and staying home and my family has been nothing but supportive. CA-125 is higher than usual but still bellow 35 which apparently can happen with inflammation. Still getting and MRI to rule out any recurrence"
cancer,fcj4p5b,t3_ehe7s9,1577677212.0,Thanks! I‚Äôm heading to the ER now to rule out anything like kidney stones or appendicitis before I leave for New Years cruise with my kids. Definitely need to get better at sticking up for myself.
sexual_assault,f8wrwcv,t1_f8qnfjr,1574898263.0,"I hate talking. So I wrote down everything o wanted to tell them. What happened, how it made me feel and how it is affecting me. Then I just sent it to them and hoped they wouldn‚Äôt judge me. It was scary but they surprised me in a good way.  
Do whatever you need to do to heal. And I‚Äôm the meantime I‚Äôm here if you want to chat!"
sexual_assault,f8mybjv,t1_f8mm383,1574636741.0,"Find a group of people you can trust outside of therapy and be open with them about it. I started out small just telling one person and has since told a couple more friends and they have been nothing but supportive and understanding of the effects it has had on me. 
Next up is telling my family. But that‚Äôs going to be very very hard."
sexual_assault,f8fu5fg,t3_e0mkhp,1574549471.0,Very similar situation. I realized two years after my ex and I broke up that he had been assaulting me the entire time. It‚Äôs hard to say that it is assault because it wasn‚Äôt violent and in a way you didn‚Äôt suffer enough to be in the same category as many women and men who have had much worse happen to them. But it doesn‚Äôt make what happened to you Any less valid. And you have every right to call it assault because that is what happened to you. Your fears and thoughts are valid. Don‚Äôt feel stupid and don‚Äôt feel that you‚Äôre exaggerating or imagining things. Your deserve to deal with what happened to you without being ashamed. I highly recommend therapy wether that be online or in person. It has tremendously helped me manage my PTSD. Wish you the very best.

mentalhealth,f3tv3t2,t3_di5rmh,1571146851.0,My psychiatrist prescribed me seriously 50mg. It‚Äôs an antipsychotic and at much higher doses used to treat illnesses like schizophrenia. At lower it helps with intrusive thoughts and ocd thoughts. It also helped me sleep. Definitely talk to a psychiatrist and they will pair you with that they think is best for you!

mentalhealth,f0lib9h,t3_d5dk6v,1568719187.0,"Same here. Always put sunscreen on them when exposed to the sun. That helped mine not get worse. Also there are some silicone scar patches that sort of worked but it did take a long time. Mine went from red think and raised to white, slightly raised and not as thick in about a year or so. 
Regardless I learned to love them in the mean time. They‚Äôre part of your story and I chose to see them as a reminder of how far I have come and how much I have progressed."
