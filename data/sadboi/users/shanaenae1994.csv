MakeupAddiction,fj2ns7j,t3_fb1tka,1582948570.0,I used either tarte facetape or too faced born this way but they’re a bit more expensive about 35$ a bottle. However the born this way foundation I literally use 1 pump for my entire face so it lasts 5x longer than anything else I’ve had. They also have a HUGE shade range and you can test them out at any of your local Ulta stores.

BipolarReddit,fip537x,t1_fip3j3q,1582598215.0,I’ve been on medical marijuana. I’ve tried every medication under the sun since I was 7. It’s like I stop working on tools and thing to calm down and  stress relievers. I let it all build up and once I have a couple episodes i I just guess it becomes habit to snap every time someone argues with me. It’s like an energy starts brewing in me and the only way to get it out is to scream or break shit or just physically  hurt myself or someone else. It’s sounds so crazy writing it all down but yeah that’s me. Fuck I’m a terrible person.
