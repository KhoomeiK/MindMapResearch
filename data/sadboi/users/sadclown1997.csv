UFOs,f26g7c5,t1_f26fwhb,1570008644.0,"then why is it completely still for 10s o minutes then jets off and fades away into a cloudless night? im sorry but i refuse to believe its a satellite. if the satellite goes around earth i would see one every time i look up at night as i do for long periods of time every single  night,there are to many satellites to only have seen three in the past 7 years especially when im star gazing almost every single night Nd have been since i was16."

UFOs,f26fg2b,t1_f26f5ub,1570007471.0,"now before i say this i gotta tell you this was absolutely not a plane but it was going the speed a plane would be going but wayyyyyy higher up like going in a straight line past earth and disapeared into nothingness, and it would be completely still and mimicking a star when i first noticed it again it was like it waited for me to look at it before it moved. judgeing how far away it was and how fast it made it across the sky i gotta say it was going realllyyy fast."
