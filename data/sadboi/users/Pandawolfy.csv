BPD,fqktjfx,t3_gj1nob,1589435868.0,"Speaking for myself, yes, my mother is narcissistic and everything revolved around her. I was always walking on eggshells around her, if her day was ""ruined"" she would fly into a rage and abuse me. It didn't matter if I was sick or injured, doing either of those things or even just looking tired would've gotten me abused. She LOVED to make me uncomfortable in public!

I rarely enjoy going outside because of how anxious and uncomfortable I get. I don't like being away from my house too long because I always feel like I'm doing something wrong. My mother would always fuel my anxiety and scream at me for looking ""suspicious"" and telling me people might think I'm going to steal something.

She's also paraded me around, not caring how embarrassed I was when I had a severe allergic reaction, she prioritized shopping before me and I hated getting those looks I got from random people when my eye was so irritated the sclera was a dark yellow. I was so uncomfortable, all I wanted to do was go home and stay home. I'm sick and tired of how NMom just didn't give a shit about me, only herself.

I don't go anywhere without taking my own car, because if something happened to me. My mother won't go ""Oh no, you're unwell, let's take you home"" it's ""PANDAWOLFY YOU'RE MAKING ME SO MISERABLE! WHY DO YOU INSIST ON DOING THIS SHIT YOU SON OF A BITCH!""

It's been hard for me to be comfortable in public without anyone there to hang around. My anxiety sky rockets when I'm in public by myself and I always just think ""I WANT TO GO HOME!"""

I don't enjoy doing things as much as my narcissistic parents, their constant criticisms of me and their tendency to lose their shit over inconsequential BULLSHIT has left me feeling foreign and anxious whenever  I'm outside with her.  


NMom would often make me feel as though I'm doing something wrong. If I was nervous in public, NMom would feed my anxiety, telling me not to look so nervous because people might think I'm going to steal something.  


Which is why I only prefer to buy things online because I look at things on my own time without my bitch mother giving me the ""hurry up"".  She's criticized that too because she's so irresponsible with her funds and she's jealous of me.  


Not only that, someone on Reddit decided it would be ""Kek"" to link to my profile and make fun of it with their friends. They poked fun at me for needing to post on here and RBN. It made me really depressed that people are so fucking blind that the small things that Narcissistic parents do to you seem immaterial to others and don't understand the context of the abuse. They made some very sweeping assumptions about me which couldn't be further from the truth  


I'm worried I might actually hurt them for how childish and toxic they were.  I can't control my emotions (that's why I'm here) I know what they look like because they were actually narcissistic, I'm aware I've said that a lot too. But they took lots of selfies and whenever they talked to me it was always about themselves.  


They were also incredibly offended and victimized when I told them they only talked about themselves and hear about themselves and felt the need to go on a subreddit to encourage harassment because I gave them some constructive criticism about their childish behavior **(THAT'S A PROPORTIONAL RESPONSE)**. So I prefer to stay home aside from work and college because even then I'm afraid I'll run into them and smash their teeth in.   


So I stay home for the safety of that idiot, who is superior online (And lives in my state) and my own mental health. I get enough shit at home and I don't need anymore."

I'm not a desirable person because of my issues,  B. I might end up with a narcissist and they'll abuse me like my parents did.  


So to avoid all that, I just push people away. Nobody cares about me. Bottom line. Nobody's forged a genuine relationship with me, everyone feels fake. I think people will stab me in the back sooner or later.
