Antipsychiatry,fq768b1,t1_fq75rxt,1589142322.0,That sounds like a major struggle. The worlds a very screwed up place for many reasons. I hope that you are recovered from that terrible time of your life. If you don‚Äôt care too much I wouldn‚Äôt mind having a DM conversation sometime.
Antipsychiatry,fq6rz1d,t1_fq3l8hm,1589137074.0,I‚Äôm supposedly going through a job program and I‚Äôm obviously a little sketched because of my label I have. Although since unemployment in the USA has dropped to as low as the Great Depression I feel as if that way would be easier. And I hope you‚Äôve gotten better since then no human being deserves that.
Antipsychiatry,fq6rno0,t1_fq5k47x,1589136951.0,Thank you very much. I have been on very ungodly and abnormal amounts just because of the symptoms I am having. When I explain to him my concerns all my doctor says is ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just not getting the answer you want to hear‚Äù. Okay doc then how am I supposed to explain my concerns on a serious level to where I respect you and your work as it is legally stated? I just quite honestly don‚Äôt know what to do because the mental health system very clearly has me with a label that will sadly trail me for life...
Antipsychiatry,fq3j1vz,t1_fq3g87d,1589066975.0,"Thank you, and there‚Äôs more to it. Medicine is supposed to make you feel better in the end but it‚Äôs became this much of an inconvenience.

Antipsychiatry,fmzezap,t1_fmzb6ur,1586518064.0,"They really don‚Äôt lol, seems as if they‚Äôre in it for the money. Everything I‚Äôve experienced with psychiatry made me feel worse and unsettling. Quite honestly I think it‚Äôs all different for everyone. Mental disorders are an odd thing because no one knows what you‚Äôre thinking except yourself. A number of different things can cause one, the reason I say it can be caused by a chemical imbalance is because everyone has different heredity and since everyone‚Äôs different that means their brains were originally born different. What I‚Äôm trying to say is chemical imbalance is a thing but there‚Äôs so many simpler better options than taking a pill that‚Äôs going to alter your brain more and screw your imbalance up more."
Antipsychiatry,fmz8afo,t3_fy4q10,1586510340.0,"Well OP is both correct and incorrect in my opinion. Bipolar disorder is definitely a very real thing, but it is caused by a chemical imbalance of some sort. The thing is, how would a psychiatrist know that this ONE specific type of med they‚Äôre giving you is the right one when there‚Äôs like 10 other chemicals listed under the same kinda disorder. I believe that saying mental illness isn‚Äôt a thing is 100 percent inaccurate. Although from my personal experience and the hell my doc and mental clinic made me go through with ‚Äúfinding the right med for you‚Äù. what I‚Äôm trying with all this is how the government want you to deal with treating your mental disorder is extremely ridiculous but that‚Äôs all from my point of view"
