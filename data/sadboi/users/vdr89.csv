WritingPrompts,f935ztb,t3_e2ys12,1575050759.0,"My eyes felt heavy, as if tears nested in them all night. I pressed down on my ears and wrinkled my face bracing for impact, as if it would stop the morning thoughts of him, that tie me to bed all day. I felt nothing. Was I finally recovering from this heartbreak? I blinked twice, slowly waiting for my vision to adjust to a piece of lint, who was fearlessly enjoying free fall. Pink lint? I always despised that color. Maybe childhood trauma brought resentment towards this color. My sister had it all, and she loved pink. It‚Äôs interesting how even a color can bring the most monstrous emotions out of a person. I can‚Äôt feel the usual itchy scraping from my bedspread on my bear stomach, I always sleep without any clothes on, just some underwear. Anxiety sprung up my chest as I touched my torso, I‚Äôm wearing a pink bathrobe. Why am I wrapped in a fuzz I would never intend to wear? I look around my room and it‚Äôs exactly how I left it before I went to sleep, except the bottle of painkillers are still on my nightstand, completely replenished as if remorse had a reverse button. What happened last night? Why am I wearing my sisters robe, but most importantly where is he. HIM. I couldn‚Äôt assemble any thoughts of a male I was searching in my files for. My fingers start to intertwine with their air as I reminisce about a prairie replaced with curly brown locks. Who is he? Why does he hurt? My fingers start to pull on my white rugged sheets, as the prairie converts to grassland and his hair into a short term memory, slipping into another life. My door pushes open and my fight with my memory is interrupted. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you sleep?‚Äù It‚Äôs my mom. I wanted to ask her if she had dressed me in my sisters robe. But that would mean I‚Äôd have to confront her about my overdose. But maybe she knew, maybe she stopped me before I could grasp the last medication that would remove me from that miserable place. I held on to the robe, as I tried to retrieve its owner. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs my sister?‚Äù Confusion and concern of a dumbfounded face was my answer, ‚ÄúWhere is S‚Äî‚Äú  again I was looking for an identity I could not construct, my fingers started to search the air again, for a name, a face, a presence I cannot recall. Only an image comes up, a silent prairie with drunken butterflies fluttering towards nothing, just as my thoughts began to feel intoxicated as they hit a wall. I don‚Äôt know why I feel as if this image used to be made up of something else, maybe it was part of a crazy dream I had. Some foolish dream that was, or another absurd D√©j√† Vu. ‚ÄúNever mind, just a haunting dream I had, I have work in a bit so I‚Äôm skipping breakfast‚Äù those words seemed to ease my mom, as well as myself. I‚Äôm reassured that it was all a fantasy established by my cryptic unconscious mind. I got up out of bed, and took off the hideous bathrobe, I‚Äôm guessing too many drinks had something to do with it. Those vivid dreams were you don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre awake or not, is what I think took place last night. How mysterious the mind is, somehow it made me feel as if I lost everything but at the same time moved on quickly. Sleeping can be so enigmatic."

AskReddit,f538y5l,t3_dlxiry,1571957519.0,"I‚Äôm a really friendly person, so while I was in  High School, I was that kid who just talked to everyone. I remember that I wanted as many friends as possible, because laughing was such a big part of my day, that I wanted to share joy with everyone in my grade. I was really intimidated to talk to this group of girls who I had been wanting to be friends with. I usually would talk to everyone, but them in particularly for some reason intimidated me into not doing so. I finally worked up the courage to say something one day, and I remember that they just laughed at me and walked away. They turned the corner of the hallway and didn‚Äôt realize I had to go the same way as them, and as I was turning to go to my class I heard one of the girls say ‚Äúthat girl is such a weirdo‚Äù. I remember feeling something in my chest just crumble, I wanted to cry but I couldn‚Äôt because I was in school. I forced a smile the rest of the day, but I‚Äôm pretty sure that moment grew a lot of insecurity in me for the rest of the years to come. 

PS: they all became my friends later into the year, but occurrences like these happened to me often, and it felt the same every time."
