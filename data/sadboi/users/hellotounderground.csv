I never had anything like that, I was homeschooled my whole life, so I never had those social experiences. I've also not been involved in many extracurricular either, so for the last 4 years I've just kinda sat in my room feel depressed.

To this day I'm suicidal over it, but the past is the past and I can only make a better future. To make matters even more grim, I'm a dropout so moving directly into a four year is off the table.

As of right now, the plan is to go to a community college for two years then transfer to a 4-year program. And as much economical sense as that makes, I'm still sick to my stomach over missing out on not only highschool, but also college now too.

I feel so emotionally stunted, I'm intimidated by social situations, and now I have to live in the hostile environment that is my house for another two years. 
For real, my single plan was going to college this fall. But now I feel kinda hopeless. I don't even know what to say. I feel kinda numb. :< we in this together y'all"

I understand how hard it can be just to get through the day. I remember the cracked aching hands too. It sucked so badly. I'm so sorry :< Its truly one of the worst feeling in the world. I can't imagine having to deal with it now.

Something that really helped me was mantras to remind myself of the truth. Phrases like ""These thoughts are not true"" or ""I'm ok, right now I'm ok"". helping in a lot of places.

another thing that helped me specifically with hand-washing ocd was forcing myself to use my hands normally even if they felt dirty.  These ""exposures"" can help over time.

Exposures aren't the kind of thing that I could do very often. But when I could manage to get through them they helped

&#x200B;

stay strong, I know from experience that new compulsions are always the hardest to deal with. Everyone of my compulsions has weakened with time. Plus OCD is well understood in the medical world, and treatment can help"

askteenboys,fohkpgp,t3_g79fro,1587767571.0,"a about 50% of people experience this phenomena

b These thoughts are the product of the brain sending an ""alarm"" signal, telling you to notice danger. This leads to the more rational side of your brain ""making up"" a reason that you needed to avoid danger.
Ex. brain: DANGER, KNIFE IS SHARP
     you: why did I think that
     brain: you were probably gonna stab someone

on a more anecdotal note, persistent intrusive thoughts can be a symptom of OCD. Which you should look into if these thoughts continue.

Seriously, I was in the depths for years, and I'm so glad I lived on to find that I wasn't a horrible person, just that I was surrounded by cold people. 

And let me tell you, for a while there I believed it. It truly thought I was garbage and that I don't belong anywhere - I thought that people would hate me no matter what. I was WRONG

People are so often unempathic and hateful, even in the LGBT community we see people who overlook the message of love and acceptance. 

Seriously, some people are idiots. Fuck their stupid ass opinions. These people are so unbelievably biased against others it's insane. - hence, their ideas can be safely disregarded. Just like how I would disregard A flat-earther's ideas about NASA. They can't be trusted to see clearly. 
These people are so sure that they're right, they have all the info because they read a twitter thread.

As I lived on, I found that there are kind people. People who will recognize you for the amazing person you truly are. One day you'll look back on this time as a bitter and distant memory. All these people will fade out of focus.

I used to think that suicide was the only way out, It's not. I'm so glad now that I lived. I was able to one day, leave all of that behind slowly but surly
