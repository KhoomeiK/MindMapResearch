I think it’s only fun to cosplay disability if you are able to walk away from it when it gets tiresome, like being alone and have to go up (or down) a steep ramp. Or needing something on the 3 third shelf in the stores uch annoying.

It is hard to see a person make their whole personality be a diagnoses, and to be honest in my group of (disabled and chronically ill) friends I don’t know anybody that is like that. I think that I only know the exact diagnoses of one friend of mine and that was because we where talking specificity  about a training she did. The other ones; no I don’t need or want to know.

But this flaunting of diagnoses and play a “who is the saddest ill girl/boy of all the ill boys and girls” game, you want that medal? Well here it is and now get the fuck off of my IG.

Man this gets me riled up still, lemme get a cuppa tea and calm down ;)"

Just seeing me “walk” makes it obvious something is wrong.

Why... because it doesn’t define me, I am not poor disabled Smirgutt... I’m just Smirgutt.
That is what I love about being online, i am just like everybody else for me it is the great equalizer. To see these pll go on hikes but take valuable resources away from pll that can’t ever get up a fucking gravel path or cross a river without someone carrying them. It just passes me off to no end.

Also pt isn’t supposed to be fun or even pain free, it’s not like getting a nice massage, it’s trying to get a body into a somewhat working state and keep it from deteriorating. 

Idk how many pt you can get in the States but where I live it is approx 40-ish and after that you have to pay for them yourself. But with holidays and other days off calculated in it will last you a year."

I seriously think abled bodied people think it is “fun” and “ easy” to have to use a wheelchair, but the idea of a wheelchair is only fun if you don’t HAVE to use it to be mobile. The fact that people that are not paralyzed use a wheelchair is unbelievable for a lot of people, they can’t understand that their are other disabilities that make you have to rely on mobility aids like a chair or scooter."

I know quite a few moms with children that are also on the spectrum because our kids went to a school especially for kids with autism (until funds were cut and they had to close). Some of those kids are in care (or psychiatric) facilities, they do FaceTime, call ect but the daily routine is gone and they are having a hard time. Not just the kids but the parents and the care givers to. 
Lockdown eventho I understand why we have to do it, it does not take these groups, autistic and other disabilities in to account.

disability,fmpozyb,t3_fwi3k6,1586284742.0,"What a great idea, as a (physically disabled) mom of a child with autism the lockdown is hard. What I deal with at home and what I hear moms around me have to deal with, is the total breakdown of any and all routines. The schools are closed, the extra care facilities are closed. There is no therapy other then that we can get the medication by phone. If you have the bad luck that your child is in a care facility you cannot visit your child and well all of that sucks. Kids feel scared and uprooted now that all “normal” daily life has come to a standstill. And we can’t explain it in to much detail because you don’t want to scare them more then they already are.  Children with autism (I don’t know about other disabilities) don’t get a feeling from safety through human interactions, they get it by having an unchanging routine, all that is gone now. And because nobody can come and visit them and they can’t have their routine the situation is volatile to say the least.

I’ ve have had therapist and school call and ask if they can help, but there is nothing they can do over the phone. All we as parents can do is be patient and try and get some sort of routine going. With zero help and a child that has lost his footing...just hope that he doesn’t escalate and turn aggressive or gets depressed. We’re walking a fine line here and it is hard on all of us, parents and childeren 

I just hope that the special care facilities and schools will open soon so all of these kids can get back to the safety of having a daily routine.

They are saying GP’s will always ask an older person if they want to go to all lengths to preserve live, but usually it’s a face to face talk. Now that the icu beds are needed so much, some of them have started calling the “weaker” patients in their offices. Eventho I get where they are coming from what I have heard is that people were shocked and felt pressured into saying they would not “want” to go to an icu.
Just imagine your GP semi guilting you into feeling like a ego-centrical dickweed for wanting to do all you can to survive this. I know the older or sicker you are the less the chances are of getting out of it without some permanent damage but ffs I have kids, I have a family and I pay my insurance on time always. Why am I asked this and not a “healthy” person.

But face it by the time all icu beds are full and they start screening who to save... I’m dead. Not even because I may or may not make it, but purely because I am disabled that is what they will look at. Older, sick or disabled people are worth less.. or that is how it feels.

I get that they need the beds but damn it harsh calling people and telling them “if you get it chances are you’re gonna die.

I get the frustration of abled bodied people using disabled spaces, fitting room and toilets are my pet peeve.

But for me it has been a life changer, no more asking for rides I can come and go as I please, I love it.
Having said that The Netherlands (where I am at) is a serious bike riding country we have bike lanes everywhere and cars are used to sharing the road with bikes. So I feel relatively save, it is an issue that cars “over look” me sometimes so I have to stay alert but the roads here are build with bikes in mind so that helps A LOT.

My bike had a “top” speed of 12,6 km/h (they said it was 15 but they lied) which is just way too slow. I mean I got over taken by five year olds, and it was hard for people to ride with me because I was so slow. I knew they capped the speed so a google search and a smart SO found the software that caps the speed and we adjusted it to 22 km/h. I wouldn’t go that fast in town but on the long straight bike lanes outside of town it is great being able to keep up with my friends and family.

As far as the clothes, I feel ya, I used to wear Victorian dresses, bustle and all, corsets and capes (old school Goth) but it doesn’t take a genius to see that that would work anymore, as they were all hand made to fit me they have become useless. The 50-ies dresses were store bought so I donated them to our local shelter. I couldn’t donate the Victorian ones, just to much time and memories so they are on a rack in my attic. We seem to have similar tastes in colour (90% black) so for me it’s leggings and a band T or harem pants and a band T.

About my chair I have motor assisted wheels, because my strength and stability of the joints is bad. My city counsel will provide you with one mobility aid and I had to choose between a scooter or a wheelchair. I picked the chair because I can’t use the scooter indoors. Last year I crowdfunded a electric “hand”bike that attaches to my chair. It was hard but I got about 50% funded by friends and family. We had been saving up for a few years and but they are so expensive without my friends help it would have taken me another 3 years.

The hand bike is amazing, I live in a country we’re everybody rides bikes everywhere so for me it is a workable situation and it has given me so much more freedom.

Once I started talking about the abuse (took me a few years tbh) in the group home I lived in at the time, I was taken seriously and I was kept save, so I was lucky in that.
Overcoming abuse is so so so hard and if your parents won’t let you get help it will be 1000 times harder. I hope that someday you can get the help you need in dealing with that.
As for your friends, it seems that they do care, like you said they stand by you even when you break down. I can’t tell you how to tell them what you need but somehow you need to tell them, you deserve that and they deserve a chance to support you in the way you need. Or am I being tremendously naive?
As I said I got lucky in finding a friend that was abused in some of the same ways I was, and “us” victims or survivors whatever label you want to use tend to recognize each other, so at times we ended up with 4 or 5 girls sharing our stories. I can’t tell you how much that helped me, to be with people that “get” you on that level, not gonna say I am over it, some shit you bone vet get over but it did make me feel less alone.

But on a serious note, how telling is it that abled bodied people think they have the insight and right to tell us what is and isn’t accessible. Disregarding our experience as a whole, it is mind boggling. Just because they don’t live with a disability and most likely don’t know anybody that has one, we as a group don’t matter at all.

wheelchairs,ey4lgiq,t3_cvg9c9,1566796607.0,"I have been using my e-motion wheels for mmm 2 years now, I got lucky and was able to get them financed trough my cities disability funds. Anyway, it was a step learning curb and lots of flipping backwards, but now I love them. E-motion has a remote (which I didn’t get :/) that would be able to set 2 “speeds” on for let’s say going at a walking speed and one going faster. You are able to set these speeds yourself so you just need to figure out what speeds you like. As I have no remote I only use one speed but that works fine for me. It allows me to go way further then I would be able to do on my own, as you need no strength to speak of, just move the hand rail to touch the contact and it will push.

A downside is that you cannot use them indoors, in smaller spaces they are hard to control and I find myself pushing on the wheels if I need to wiggle in a tight space.  So indoors I need to change the wheels because of that, but as I have a different chair I can also use indoors it is not a problem for me.

The wheels have a pretty good battery live and are easy to switch on and off, downside is when they are off they are heavy and hard to push. Also a hand bike cannot be used with them, I was told that would blow up the batteries, donnow if that is true but not going to gamble with it. They can go into error mode when the wheels even slightly move when switching on... very annoying at times.

That is all I can think up on Monday morning before coffee, good luck picking what works for you."

MCDD has a huge fear and  schizoid component (10% chance of getting full blown schizophrenia in puberty) and al lot of kids with MCDD are placed in care because they get aggressive. Not their fault is it fight or flight and most boys pick fight, it is heartbreaking to see them fighting like a trapped animal in such fear, but also impossible to integrate into society, thank heavens my boy is a flight kid so I can manage him at home still.
But he will never be able to face the world alone he will always need an “interpreter” by his side to help him navigate. Having said that I will do whatever I can to help him to lead a full and happy life. And I do believe he can, he is smart enough, just people are a big ???? to him.

Although it did do a reasonably okayish job in portraying severe (or deep) autism, it did lead to a lot of misconceptions.
I thought Imitation game was pretty good, I know I laughed at some parts being so recognizable, I have a son with severe autism (MCDD although not used as a diagnoses anymore is very specific). It is very hard to tell him “no” for anything I would have said yes to before, but that just means I need to think very hard about what I will allow. 
The screaming and “flipping out” is mostly a sign he is over his limit and I as a parent should guard that for him as he can’t himself. Regardless what the world may think of one of those episodes they hurt him to, it must be an awful feeling to feel and be so out of control.

I think the problem with things like autism, schizophrenia, PTSD and other severe mental illness is that everybody will experience it in a different way no 2 people will have the same symptoms. But that is too broad and people just love their stereotypes, so they will lump all autistic, all schizopherns, all... just fill in whatever on a big heap and expect the same behaviors from them.
