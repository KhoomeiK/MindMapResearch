It scares me when I think like that but then I realise I need to try move forward and make something of what little time I have. It always helps me when im on the edge. Savour all the good moments.

If you didnt want the responsibility then dont have a kid. They are hard work. They are expensive. Dont expect them to give you everything back you gave for them.
