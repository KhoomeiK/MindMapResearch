FORTnITE,fr4cskq,t1_fr4bwvs,1589884002.0,Probably anything and everything that you have. There are some really obnoxious players out there who have watched those scammer gets scammed videos that several youtubers have done and think that that’s how this game runs. This game isn’t Pokémon. I might share my weapons with my partner or the couple of friends that I regularly play with and vice versa but that’s if we don’t have a certain weapon and the other person does or if it’s only levelled up to a certain point and we are in a higher area and the other person has it levelled up enough to suit the area. Then we will give the resources needed for whatever it is that’s needed to be built. That’s only right and fair since it’s that person’s resources being used to create whatever it is.

It is also important to do the entire mission because it won’t count if you do the collecting or whatever it is that Ray wants you to do and then leave before the mission is finished. 

Be prepared to spend some v bucks on llamas, this will give you schematics to craft weapons and traps as well as survivors and heroes to level up. Most importantly don’t be in a rush to get to the max level, it takes time to discover your play style and learn how the game works.

After that, you top it off with some creamy fresh milk and then let the milo rise to the top on its own and a nice thin skin of milk covers the milo (like a bubble almost). If done right, the barest touch of a teaspoon will disrupt the milk skin and leave a dry layer of milo for you to eat.

Milo also works really well on vanilla ice cream or lightly covering a bowl of Rice Bubbles if you can’t afford Coco Pops."
