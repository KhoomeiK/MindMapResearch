Also, just because you are feeling happy doesn't mean that the urge is necessarily going to go away. That's how it is for me... It doesn't matter what mood I'm in, I can still want to self harm. I personally see it as an addiction. To the chemicals the brain releases when we self harm. Those chemicals help us feel better which is why self harm is usually linked with feeling bad, but it doesn't always have to be."

Please keep fighting. There is hope, even though you can't see it right now. After my last attempt, I felt horrible for doing it. For what I put my family and friends through.

I absolutely agree on the hospital part. I can talk about it with a few of my friends without them totally freaking out on me. But some friends are liable to call the police if I talk too seriously about it. 

I'm actually in a day therapy program right now, for the depression and thoughts, among other things. And I can talk about the thoughts there, even if they're awful, without them just sending me off to the hospital, as long as I can say I'm not going to do anything. Having a professional I can talk to in depth about what's in my head without worrying they are going to force the hospital is amazing."

The therapist had called in a welfare check with the police and they got there pretty darn quick. I ended up in the ER and then the psych ward (again) for a week. At first I was mad that the therapist had called them and essentially ""saved"" me, but *now* I can see I didn't die that day for some sort of reason. Not sure what it is, and I still struggle with the suicidal thoughts, even today I had them, but at least a tiny little piece of me wants to be alive. 

I hope you can get to that point, OP. I hope that you can start to feel better, at least enough to want to try to survive another day."

I hate that there is stigma around men and mental illness. I've had two male friends commit suicide recently, one in September and one this past week. Being male doesn't negate the pain you feel... but men are looked down on for having emotions, in general. Humans have emotions. It's part of being human. Mental illness does not discriminate based on gender or any other factor. Anyone can have a mental illness.

If someone makes you feel weak for self harming or laughs when you tell them or otherwise does not react in a supportive or understanding way, stay away from them. We are already struggling, we don't need people like that around us."
