BPD,fox6zen,t1_fovqzga,1588135629.0,I do exactly this as well . I have quiet bpd too
BPD,fox6voo,t3_g9smkr,1588135554.0,"YES!!! This is how I‚Äôve felt all day!! I had a good friend block me and my boyfriend this morning after a hang out . I expressed some feelings and I wasn‚Äôt rude about it but got such a reaction . It makes me feel like it was all me. I don‚Äôt know why I blame myself for everything. I think you can relate. For some reason, every flaw in an interaction somehow comes from me. But I remember the other person is 50% of the conversation and they can also do wrong. Your feelings are valid simply because you feel them. We may feel such an extreme but that feeling is still true. I don‚Äôt know how to manage the extremes yet. It‚Äôs the hardest thing of my life. Just know I feel like you. I dissect my feelings constantly trying to figure out if it‚Äôs the bpd or me"

bettasorority,fnula3s,t1_fnu0lp9,1587264813.0,They‚Äôve been together since August-September ish of 2019 and were gotten mostly still not full grown so they have grown up together. I used to have more in there but had to take the other two girls out because there was aggression and they live happily in their own tank. But all 4 here never bother each other. They actually touch each other and are all over each other when I feed them and when they search the floor for pellets!! It‚Äôs so damn cute to see them get along .
BPD,fntj2pn,t1_fntfo8s,1587242664.0,That‚Äôs....interesting lol

bettasorority,fmm443s,t3_fvsx8k,1586198428.0,I say girl to everyone . Don‚Äôt get easily offended that I‚Äôm gay lmao
bettasorority,fmm097d,t1_fmlzisb,1586196391.0,"If you researched then why are you still asking if you can put 3 different types of fish together, two of those fish being female AND male bettas? 
You did the bare minimum of research girl.
Just ‚Äòcause they are fish doesn‚Äôt mean their lives don‚Äôt matter"
bettasorority,fmlz1yh,t3_fvsx8k,1586195777.0,"There‚Äôs so many bad ideas in this text lol no don‚Äôt put your male in with neon tetras and females...are  you wanting them to all kill each other? Even if he‚Äôs ‚Äúnot aggressive‚Äù.Female bettas are less aggressive than males but still are aggressive fish. I have a 10 gallon tank as well and had 7 girls in it. Now there‚Äôs only 5, and two of the girls are in separate tanks because they started to attack the others as they grew older. You have to really watch with a sorority because adding new fish or changing the terrain, can cause the fish to make a new ‚Äúhierarchy‚Äù and start fin nipping again. A lil in the beginning is normal but they should not be chasing each other and trashing their bodies against each other . The tank needs to be heavily planted to break the vision of the betta and for them to run away if they need to, and to make a little ‚Äúhome‚Äù. Every sorority is different because female bettas have varying degrees of temperament dependent on that particular betta. The smallest betta I had , grew up to be the biggest, most aggressive one I have and she lives alone in a 5 gallon tank now lol
In all, get your neons a small tank if you want to use the ten gallon. Don‚Äôt put your male in there. Get at least 4 females so the aggression is dispersed . Have small 2.5-5 gallon tanks ready in case they don‚Äôt get along. If this is too much or seems extra, then a sorority may not be for you .If you don‚Äôt have time, patience and money, don‚Äôt start a female sorority.
It‚Äôs clear you didn‚Äôt really research anything and want people in this reddit to give you the answer...I‚Äôd be cautious. I urge you to research

Edit: also how the male betta breeds with the female betta (that you‚Äôd have no control over if they were together) can cause damage to the female. They literally squeeze the eggs out of the egg bound female. And after she lays eggs the male will be so protective over the eggs , he will kill the mother of them."
