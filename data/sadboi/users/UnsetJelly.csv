Good luck in there as well."
ptsd,fls11ot,t1_flrzpas,1585432088.0,"When I used to use marijuana, it was the only thing that could help me sleep and I barely ever had nightmares. It also helped me process trauma and my emotions without the intense anxiety and reaction. 
I wouldn’t overthink everything, I wouldn’t have bursts of anger as much (if at all) and I could calmly do whatever I needed to do. 
But I just haven’t been able to afford it - having only myself to rely on. Not that I would want to rely on anyone anyway. (Why do most people “help” you just to hold it against you?) 

Thank you for sharing your experience and coping mechanisms. One day I might be able to, but the past 6 months or so have been absolute hell and I just can’t."
ptsd,flrzt4j,t1_flrzexj,1585431338.0,"Yes, absolutely. It’s important to remember we are not alone in this!
Thank you kindly."
OCPD,flrzkid,t3_fph1wf,1585431194.0,"Absolutely. 
I just snap sometimes because something seemingly easy to me is being missed; very clear instructions or a simple task. e.g: cleaning, driving, organizing, etc... 
It’s admittedly the worst when I’m overtired or hungry! I know it’s irrational and I’m working on that, the rage just happens so suddenly."
ptsd,flry2z8,t1_flrxi44,1585430298.0,"Thank you - that’s really kind. 
I’m so sorry you’re dealing with this too... there’s nothing worse than having to re-live your trauma over and over again. 
I sincerely hope you get through this too. Words can’t even describe how horrible your own brain can be to you. 
You’re right- we are so damn strong."

Will also recommend no toys that make sounds: my boy has one of those squishy pig-toys with the honk sound. 
Imagine all cozy in bed, getting ready to fall asleep, but instead: “HOHONK-HONKHONK-HOOOONK.”"
ptsd,fk83gvc,t3_fh0l2a,1583948646.0,"I am so sorry to hear that, it must have been terrifying, confusing, painful and heart-wrenching. I can only imagine the pain you must be in. 
But let me tell you something... from my experience of past family members and friends passed away, all you can do is live your life for them. Take a little piece of them wherever you go. Did you mother like painting? Nature? Any particular exercise? Music choices? 
You can take a part of her & remember her everywhere you go. It will always be a reminder to live your best life everyday, just as she would have wanted. With little reminders that she’s still here with you; in your blood, bones, your DNA and your qualities that she passed on to you. 
I hope this helps. 
Stay strong, we are all so damn proud of you <3"
ptsd,fk6o4nc,t1_fk5rify,1583908838.0,"Absolutely okay! 
But I would assume it’s safer to preempt intentions rather than take the attention for granted and let their guard down. 

As long as they’re safe :)"
ptsd,fk5gnky,t1_fk5dy4n,1583880110.0,"Some FEMALES I’ve met have actually said “Wow, I wish I got stared at like that all the time.” 

No. You don’t want to feel that kind of humiliation. It feels like you can’t hide, you just need to put up with their gawking, beady eyes until you’re out of sight. Which sucks."
ptsd,fk5bca0,t3_fggcfi,1583877097.0,"Holy shit, absolutely!! It actually amazes me how much men think about sex. They can and will link anything to it. 
The other day my boyfriend giggled and sniffed one of my shirts. I say “What are you doing?” And he’s like “Your boobs have been in this.”.... yeah it’s a shirt? 

I get the testosterone thing thing and all, but damn. It’s not hard to just appreciate discreetly. (They’re going to look anyway - might as well not make it obvious) 

You know straight away when I group of males check out a female because one looks, mumbles something to the group, and they all turn their heads. 

And they legitimately think we don’t notice."
loseit,fg6r8i7,t3_ex3u64,1580575034.0,"I’m sorry to hear that. I bet you look incredible! 
I’ve noticed the difference in the way people treat me vs. before I lost weight... it’s almost like I’m a different person now to others - or at least that’s how I feel. 
I lost a total of 30 kilos and noticed when my ex best friend and ex boyfriend started treating me differently. Even bought takeaway around me very often and stuff trying to basically “fatten me up” - not my words. 
These people are toxic and don’t wish happiness for me, so I cut them out of my life for the better. 

Reddit is proud of the hard work and dedication you’ve put in and you should be absolutely ecstatic. You’ve done amazing work! <3"

So much happier than I’ve ever been with anyone when I’ve let my guard down. 

I just don’t want to be used anymore."
ptsd,fc7od7i,t1_fc7k8ki,1577514241.0,"That’s the thing - I’ve always relied on myself for as long as I can remember. I’ve found myself becoming more and more loathing of others because I could never trust or rely on anyone when I was younger, so why take the risk now? 
I just find other people get in the way now. I do/did love helping others - it makes me feel good I suppose that I make someone else happy. But the majority of people I seem to help just want to take and take from me. I don’t have much more to give. 

I don’t enjoy talking anymore. I don’t have the energy to pay attention and keep a conversation, I just zone out without even realizing. I put everything I have into my job (a mere 6 hours/3 days a week) and am completely exhausted afterwards that most days I can’t be bothered eating and sit on YouTube until I fall asleep. 

I’m such an angry person now and I don’t want to spread that anger but I just don’t know how anymore :("
ADHD,f54lzbn,t3_dmpsra,1571986249.0,"These are all super helpful. Thank you so much - I have lots of strategies to give a go! I‘m sure one will work for me and if it doesn’t, I’ll try again. I’m so desperate to “fix” this, I’m ready to give it my all this time. 
I’m very grateful for all of you guys’ help :)"

raisedbynarcissists,f1ykbt5,t3_db0ife,1569818032.0,"Straight-up. 
- Had a platelet level of 4, rushed to hospital the day after I had a blood test done in which I had to BEG my mum to get. She blamed the purpura and bruising on “school stress” and that I was being over dramatic at how tired I was. 
- Told her I had High Blood Pressure (188/113 has been the highest recorded that I know of) and had to be on medication probably indefinitely. She “Big Pharma’d” me and told me to do yoga instead. 
- Told her last year I’ve never struggled this badly mentally and I really needed help and support. (Had the ambulance called on me for presumed suicide, started self-harming again...) She told me it’s all in my head and I need to write a gratitude list. 

Once I realized she will never have an ounce of sympathy or respect for me, I cut her out completely.

Edit: Also, I saw some comments on their NParents having awful health bc of not going to the doctors and I just wanted to say... my NMum has almost ripped all her own rotten teeth out because she refuses to go to the dentist if she can “just do it herself”."

I mean, I’m kinda scared of gaining weight as I lost a fair amount since High School, but not to the point where I worry about it like that... I just kinda don’t mind if I put on a little bit of weight, but a lot I’d stress about. 

I don’t eat meat on purpose TO vomit, but I do know that it makes me vomit and I still eat it. 
I guess I’m just getting paranoid but it’s hard to shake an idea when it gets put in your head"

bulimia,f1oyivw,t1_f1oy5g3,1569666834.0,"I think my worry is sometimes I’ll eat it, even tho I know it’ll make me vomit? Like... I wanna eat it so bad, I don’t care if I’ll be sick, as long as I get to eat it? 
I kinda mentioned it to my doctor but he told me I had more pressing issues to discuss so I suppose I figured; if it wasn’t a huge deal to him, I’m probably okay if I just don’t eat meat.

But I just worry about the rare-days where I really wanna taste/eat it, you know? I guess my self control could be a little better aha I guess that’s why I’m asking..."
