PersonalFinanceCanada,f080c3i,t3_d45xbp,1568472604.0,"Did you submit a TD1 and provincial tax form when you started work?

If you are going to make under 12069 (2019 basic personal amount) total this year there is a box you can check on the form and you won't be taxed (total income less than total claim). The risk with doing this is if you make over that amount, you will be undertaxed and owe money when you file your taxes next year. You can provide your employer with updated tax forms if you need to.

Dayforce and other payroll systems determine your tax by considering the info you have submitted on your federal and provincial tax forms."

 If you have a good/fair employer they will work out a plan for repayment with you to mitigate the impact to your finances (e.g. allow you to pay it back over several months). 

Keep in mind that the ideal thing to do is repay in the year in which the overpayment occurred or else you will have to repay the gross amount next year, get a revised T4 and then recover the taxes through your return."
