Despite any issues that he or his family has... you ultimately need to consider that. If something happens, which is highly likely considering, it will fall in your hands and on your conscious. You have to decide if that is a risk and consequence you are willing to take on. You can focus on their issues all day, but you already know what you need to do."

I was in the process of job transition and moving into a new apartment in the midst of this bs, and now I’m just in limbo. Fortunately I procrastinated on doing my taxes so I’m financially okay for the moment. While I would like to be productive with writing right now I have zero motivation because most of that comes from interacting with people. And agree with you on being self aware and not knowing how to fix it. I will try to get up at a reasonable time and get on a schedule and just feel like a lazy waste of space. Then the depression kicks in and I have no motivation to do anything. I’m clean, but I have thought about getting a six pack more times than I can count."

I get so sleepy trying to read all of the material. I’m not sure how much of that is depression related, but it has been pretty overbearing."

I lost a job right before all this happened and had one lined up that I’ve yet to be able to start. I feel beyond frustrated and now just having to just sit here. It’s enough for me to keep my head right through all this without feeling unproductive.
SuicideWatch,fn9bk34,t3_fzu0jt,1586766549.0,"It’s hard dealing with something that has such negative stigma attached to it in a world that lacks empathy. One thing you need to realize is that it is NOT your fault you struggle with this. There is probably some root in your family or upbringing. Without going into detail with that, you need to seek counseling until you find the right person. People suck and we can all be judgmental when we don’t understand something, but the right person will hear you and want to help you work through this. Shame sucks and it’s horrible, but facing it takes away its power and allows you to access the tools you need to work through these feelings. You’re not scum. You’re not pathetic. You’re a human being with a struggle, and that’s okay. There are way more people who can relate than you realize."
introvert,fn51hic,t3_fzkp3a,1586653696.0,I liked going to the vet and sitting in my car the whole time instead of a waiting room. They came to the car and brought my cat back to the car when they were finished. They got the card number from me and ran it inside. I would definitely be down for the car waiting on a permanent basis. They just call your phone when it’s time to come back. Especially thinking of sitting in a waiting room with a bunch of sick people and noisy children.

relationship_advice,fn3onvg,t3_fz0tgd,1586624909.0,"Wow. This is the first time I’ve heard someone else have this problem. I’m (34f) and my mom was my dad’s secretary. There was a 14 year age gap and all of my 3 siblings are 10 to 15 years older than me. Our dad is kind of a tool bag, but that’s aside from the point right now. My brother and I talk but both of my sisters STILL hate me. They’re almost 50! It has to be exhausting being such angry bitter people. Hopefully your sister will get some well needed counseling or something. We are all products of our family, but we also have the ability to self-differentiate and become our own person. I’d like to say that there’s hope, but your sister very well may continue to hold onto this grudge like my sisters have. It’s horrible feeling hated for existing. I have felt this way so many times. I also don’t feel a part of my dad’s side of the family because I was born so late and felt unwelcome there too. They were always nice but I just didn’t belong. I didn’t have the same experience as you being so close in age, but my oldest sister had a child who was 3 years younger than me and would go on all of our family vacations and felt like my little sister. She was too young to know to hate me yet. As time went by her mother poisoned her into hating me too. It didn’t help that I was a little spoiled. I’ve given up on trying to have a relationship with them now that my parents are divorced. It’s not worth feeling guilty for something you didn’t do. We all make choices. If your sister’s choice is to stay angry with you instead of her horny father... that’s on her. She will most likely have daddy issues her entire life living to please him like my sisters do. Just hold your head up and know that this is not YOUR problem and let her eat herself up with her own anger. You can’t control what she does, but you don’t have to let her behavior control you. Once this virus clears up it would probably benefit you greatly to get some counseling for yourself. It has definitely helped me put things in perspective. If you ever want to talk, feel free to message me."
bipolar,fn3m9gh,t1_fn1prs1,1586623558.0,"I’m a Christian, and this kind of thinking freaks me out. It also contributed to my hypomania when I first accepted Christ and started going to a certain church."
bipolar,fn3l40c,t1_fn1gi54,1586622916.0,So because there was so much drug and alcohol use a lot blends together. My trips were always way more intense than other people’s and there was always this strong spiritual element involved. I’ll never forget being convinced that the zombie apocalypse happened and trying to free my pets because I didn’t want to leave them in the apartment for dead while I was out saving the world. Jesus was always on my side lol.
bipolar,fn1lyzv,t1_fn1ldus,1586564862.0,Ah. I see it in that context now. That makes sense. Fortunately some research indicates that personality disorders aren’t necessarily something that a person is stuck with for the rest of their lives. Though most research is only done on borderline and antisocial PD and they have little to explain the etiology. Self-awareness is key to coping with any disorder. A person with Narcissistic PD is capable of improving but they first have to face it and want to make a change. 15% of the population have fit the criteria for at least one personality disorder at some point in their lifetime. But not all continue to present with symptoms throughout their entire lives. So PDs aren’t necessarily the worst thing to have. Bipolar disorders tend to be with us our whole lifetime.
bipolar,fn1cmar,t1_fn0xkx2,1586559244.0,That’s a bit harsh. No one’s situation is hopeless. As someone who struggles with bipolar disorder why say something that increases negative stigma to a disorder you don’t have?

I let an ex put a Mario mushroom chicken scratch tattoo on my side and later had another ex cover it with the brain from lil dicky’s music videos.

When I got out of my last relationship I would be fine and then I would go down a horrible spiral of emailing my ex and same. I always knew I had an alcohol problem and attributed my problems to that back when, but when I realized it was from bipolar disorder it makes so much more sense now.

relationship_advice,flkj5wl,t3_fpdgqe,1585241910.0,"Wow. That’s a lot. While there are always two sides to every story, it does seem that there is a pattern of control on your partner’s side that is not okay. As embarrassing as it is to admit this, I (33f) have been guilty of being the controlling person in my relationships as well. That’s something I’m not proud of, but it’s real. I’ve done a lot of self-evaluation and worked on self-awareness, but there’s no way I could have done that if I was still in any of my former relationships. Regardless of your flaws (we ALL have them), no one has a right to make you feel less than or establish a core truth about you. A partnership is exactly that... a partnership. Give and take. Your partner sounds like she needs to do some serious self-evaluation instead of trying to force you into that. Something that stood out to me, in particular, was needing to talk after the dog pooped in the house. That’s some next level ridiculousness right there. Lol. There has GOT to be some wiggle room in a relationship to be fun and goofy and be yourself. Also the “I know I’m right” part. I have a strong disdain for that mentality. 

Anyway... it took me being by myself to work through a lot of my past trauma that led me to controlling behavior. Our brains are powerful. We develop defense mechanisms that serve to protect the organism at a young age that no longer work when we are adults. There are unhealthy familial patterns that we learn and continue until we break the cycle and self-differentiate. Feel free to message me if you need an ear. Try to hang in there. Writing and art are essential outlets for me. Also Brené Brown. Lol. She has an amazing talk on Netflix called The Call to Courage."

Girl the best thing you can do right now is break out the paints or draw lol. I enjoy writing and find it extremely therapeutic. You could spend this time writing through your feelings and experiences through this and get a head start on the goodbye process. This may even give you more encouragement that you are making the right decision and give you some closure. As much as it sucks right now this is a blessing in disguise because you will have extended time to know for sure that this is over. Hang in there. You got this."

relationship_advice,fjsl1x2,t3_fet0be,1583598104.0,"Hm... yeah definitely maybe choose your wording a little differently. Expressing your concern for bringing children in the world who will have a more difficult life sounds better than “I don’t want to have children with her”. Also, I know people with neurological disorders who are pretty amazing people... including myself. Our disorder is one of the things that make us special and unique. Honestly, what is normal anyway? Over 15% of the population has a personality disorder. I mean, there’s risk involved anytime you have a child."

Christian,fg2egs0,t3_ewgy1z,1580443462.0,"Kind of like how most “Christian” responses sound like they are reading scripted lines from some self righteous handbook that attempts to shut people down instead of actually listen to understand instead of respond? Lol. Yes... it’s funny because there are so many examples in the Bible that display how many of the men God used for His work had “worldly” knowledge. Moses was taught in Egyptian schools.. Paul was an extremely intelligent man who was well versed in Greek philosophy... and Daniel let them go as far as to change  his name without putting up a fuss. He held his ground ONLY when put in a position that would infringe on his obedience to God. Many American Christians are ready to fight for no apparent reason to feel like we won some kind of victory for God when we seem to forget... He doesn’t need our help. I can’t speak for God, but I’m sure He would prefer that we genuinely build loving relationships where we care about getting to know others than push more people away from Him because we’re stubborn and need to be right. We have no idea what persecution is here. All wisdom comes from God, and God gifted us with the ability to learn. It’s a shame how so many Christians settle with throwing out knowledge to remain simple minded and ignorant. It’s like using the Bible as an excuse to be intellectually lazy. Heaven forbid reading a book that wasn’t written by a Christian author. If we’re strong in our faith and have solid Christian friendships to hold us accountable, we should be able to listen to others and be more open to see our similarities instead of our differences. It’s not our job to judge those outside of the church, nor should we have any desire to. That’s pride at its finest. Churches should really start to teach discipleship classes in empathy."

That came more from an unsupportive family anyway. I have amazing friends, but if I don’t get some time to recharge to myself I’m horrible to be around. I love people, but when I’m done I’m done. Honestly it confuses me to no end how needy so many people seem to be. People who constantly need to be entertained have always exhausted me. Currently, I’m staying with a friend and her family while I get back on my feet. She’s an amazing person, and I love her family. I’m so very thankful for them letting me stay here rent free, but they have no concept of alone time and constantly need to be talking. Sometimes it’s nice to just shut up and enjoy the quiet together without needing to fill it with noise! Her 11 year old daughter is my homie, but she literally sings about everything she is doing and is desperate for constant attention. I’m moving out soon, but I’m getting to that really done point. Between working full-time and taking graduate classes, I literally want to talk to no one when I get home and she keeps leaving her daughter at the house with me pretty much anytime I’m not working. Again... so thankful for her letting me stay here. I’m honestly thinking maybe I’ll just start going to the library to do schoolwork so she doesn’t take the opportunity to leave her daughter with me anymore. She doesn’t even bother me. It’s just that when I’m trying to use the time I have to stay focused on research papers, the last thing I need is being distracted or asked when I’m going to be done with schoolwork so I can hang out. None of the family have any concept of putting forth effort in school or how much time it takes to do the reading and coursework for a graduate degree. Aaahhhhh. Sorry. I had to rant."
relationship_advice,fevwx9t,t3_eqlna5,1579402498.0,"Something that may not register or seem productive in the heat of everything right now but is well intentioned is this... From what you shared.. and I can relate.. it sounds like you may have gotten into a relationship with him because you saw something good and wanted to fix him. Right now you may read that and immediately shrug it off like I’m sure I initially did. Something that I (34F) have learned over the years is that I have always ended up dating people who were fixer uppers I guess you could say. And that in itself sounds terrible. Like who am I to think I’m in a place to change someone for the better when I have so many things to work on? The past few years, in particular, have been a huge step in personal growth and self-awareness and realizing what has been lacking in love for myself that has led me into terrible relationships. The most toxic people are generally the ones who hurt us the most and when we have family history or other reasons for having “less than” standards for ourselves it’s hard to break some of those patterns. I understand all too well how much you are hurting right now. That you have so much love to give and wonder why someone you invested so much time in could hurt you and treat you so callously. It’s one of the worst feelings in the world, and I have felt that depression and hopelessness far too often. Now is the time for you to start healing and start taking steps to loving you. Listen to encouraging speakers... read books by inspiring women. You’re going to be okay. You’re not alone."

The right counselor will make you feel heard and will truly care and walk alongside you as your guide in finding healing. You just have to find the right one. I would also suggest finding a group to get involved with to share your pain with others who have been there. If you’re interested in the spiritual aspect of healing... celebrate recovery is an amazing group to get involved with."
relationship_advice,fdwz300,t3_emyq6w,1578763727.0,"I agree with premarital counseling. Personally, I feel that when you make the choice to marry someone you should be in a place where looking out for each other’s best interest comes first. The whole test thing sounds kind of nuts to me, but you haven’t shared about the friends and if there is any legitimate concern about these friends. I feel like the whole wedding thing is overrated, and the main thing should be about marrying your best friend and who cares who is there or isn’t. So it seems like this whole fight is something on a deeper level that maybe isn’t being addressed and that you should try to figure that out before legally committing to someone in a possibly miserable union. If there is no legitimate concern about the friends, homeboy is demonstrating some seriously controlling and possibly narcissistic qualities, and if he is a narcissist you need to run for the hills and not look back because nothing but pain awaits you."

I was with the last person I was with because of this exact reason. What’s crazy is how much you miss these relationships. I’ve come to terms with a lot of my issues and it’s always the cliche lookin for love in all the wrong places lol. I never had that love from my parents but was an emotional parent to immature parents and I think that’s where that manifested. It’s all about breaking the cycle.
relationship_advice,fddtnjm,t1_fdclnv2,1578323687.0,"I agree with this. Also during this time of finding yourself maybe look into some of your family patterns and try to discover what drew you to this relationship to begin with so that you can avoid this same dynamic in the future. I realized that I have a pattern of getting into relationships with narcissists because both of my parents are narcissists. We subconsciously replicate relationships that we had with our mother or father. It’s crazy but many psychological approaches provide evidence that we do this. I’m finally breaking the cycle, and honestly I would rather be single for the rest of my life than get involved with the wrong person again and go through the emotional drain and depression of escaping anymore of these toxic relationships. I’m taking it slow."
Christian,fcxp99f,t3_ejb31n,1578068268.0,"This is some of the same logic of a book I just finished called “Confessions of an Adulterous Christian Woman.” Lyndell uses examples of Christians who were very active in church leadership positions, yet left their spouses for each other. They were so bold as to hold hands when sitting in the church office claiming that their relationship was God’s will. There are two ways... God’s way and my way. When we justify lifestyles or decisions that are in direct opposition to what the Bible teaches... we are not living in God’s will. We are simply picking and choosing what to believe in the Bible. Your friends aren’t doing anything new. Every day people attempt to be right with God but live their own version of what that means. There isn’t any blessing or protection in that, and the slope just gets more slippery as sin becomes more easy to justify."
Christian,fcv5q3v,t3_einu6k,1577995194.0,"I can relate to what you are going through. The most important thing is being a part of a good Christian community and, specifically for what you are going through, getting into a program like Celebrate Recovery. I have my struggles with addiction as well, and I heard it said in the CR community once that relapse was where true healing occurred. There is a lot that goes with that, but I think it has a lot to do with humility. When I first gave my life to Christ I actually had no struggle giving things up, and I think that had a lot to do with me finally giving my life to Christ and admitting I couldn’t do it on my own. I actually didn’t fully understand what I was doing at the time because I literally had just given up and come to my end. This power came into my life that could only be described as the Holy Spirit, and for the first time in my life I had power to say no. Yet... years later I found myself struggling again and it had a lot to do with me never completely facing all my demons. Though I thought I did... I didn’t realize how dysfunctional my family was and how unworthy I felt. When I first gave my life to Christ I loved God with all my heart... but I didn’t love me. What followed was a lot of people pleasing and approval seeking which led to some pride... and fall. I recommend counseling with a professionally licensed counselor on top of Celebrate Recovery to help you discover and face the inner demons that are buried deeper than the addiction. Addiction in itself is a surface issue. Prayers with you friend. Address this now before you no longer feel the need to repent because if you are already losing conviction, you will soon lose any desire to “do what’s right”."

I never really knew who I was until I was single and focused on God and loving myself. Then I stopped feeling like I needed to be with someone and really appreciated other aspects of life that I never could before when I was focused on being with another person. Take time to volunteer to help others... read... and maybe look to something greater for strength. Find something you love to do that makes you you, and as hard as it is to be around people right now... force yourself to be in good company so depression doesn’t cripple you."

Then paperwork and lawyers on top of pain and heartache."
