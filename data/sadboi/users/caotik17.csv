Herpes,fosue9c,t1_fosp1yx,1588038250.0,Oh wow really? Do they disclose to you in their appointments? I only ask because I’m terrified to even tell people like that. 😭😂
Herpes,fosgxe5,t3_g98llj,1588030489.0,I’d like to know the answer to this too! My only hang up in getting waxed.
Herpes,fo3p2al,t1_fo37ep0,1587490603.0,We will get there y’all. Keep the hope. 🤞🏻
Herpes,fnec9pw,t3_fpvfpz,1586886789.0,I just donated as well!
Herpes,fmd7oqw,t1_fmc4ru9,1585961185.0,Thank you! Best decision I’ve ever made.
Herpes,fmc2lec,t3_fu3906,1585937732.0,"I stayed in an abusive relationship for four years because I had it and thought no one else would want me.
He and his ex had found out they had it together. He got with me and never disclosed his status.
Needless to say, I stayed and stayed because I could not imagine having to disclose to someone.

I left him last June and finally got out of an abusive relationship and also have had two successful disclosures with dating. One negative. But that’s alright. I’m choosing to be single for now and enjoy my newfound freedom and peace.

But don’t feel pressured/obligated/afraid of ending it.
Life still goes on!
I am so much happier now than I was before. Even with knowing someday I have to disclose it again."
quiver,fkvx44l,t3_fkyfee,1584578572.0,My favorite 🤞🏻
Herpes,fhdz22q,t3_f2epcb,1581508341.0,"I love this. I’m totally with you. Disclosing would be the right thing to do. And I implore everyone to disclose first. We all remember what it was like to find out we had it, even moreso when you weren’t first given the choice to decide if your partner was someone who you would take that risk with.

However, we all handle things differently. I can’t even say I blame my ex for not telling me. It’s scary. To me personally though, it just goes to show him and I are just built different. Hopefully since we broke up, he’s gotten to a point he can disclose.
I’m still angry he didn’t tell me, and angry that I have it, but I’m a sucker for playing devils advocate and I do understand why he didn’t.

Give it a few more years and we will all be in a better place with this.

To anyone struggling with disclosure, just take your time and wait for the right moment. With the right person, it will feel much easier to disclose than with the wrong one.
It’s cliche, but it’s true.
And there’s plenty enough people out there who will still want you despite that fact.
I’ve only been rejected once over it.

Good luck, everybody. 🤍
And try not to beat yourself up.
Herpes doesn’t mean you don’t deserve to be happy and it doesn’t mean you’re dirty."
Herpes,fh70028,t1_fh6zlsc,1581310634.0,"From my understanding, one of the requirements for participating is having already been diagnosed and have between 2-9 outbreaks a year.
However, if it’s only to prevent catching it, imagine how much better disclosure would go?
If someone can be vaccinated to not also get it from you, that’s still a major win."
Herpes,fh6zgyn,t1_fh6xcrk,1581310183.0,I definitely would if I was closer!

Wow."
NarcissisticAbuse,fdk1crw,t3_ellbgb,1578493621.0,"Yes!!!! I am so proud. Leaving your NEX is one of the hardest things you’ll ever do but the peace you just gained is only going to increase tenfold with time. You became your biggest advocate and don’t ever ever forget the strength it took for you to make that call.
I’m so happy for you. 😭❤️🤞🏻"
Herpes,fd3q911,t1_fd3csib,1578160752.0,"Wow. I suppose that’s better than a super negative response. Either way, proud of you. That takes courage and I admire that, especially as I’m not yet brave enough to do the same."

Someone else said it too, but imagine if 12 year old you could respond. There is hope out there. And there is happiness.
I hope you do not follow through on your plans. I hope you find peace. This truly broke my heart."

Herpes,f3o743e,t3_dhgc4p,1571010053.0,I am not there yet but I applaud your bravery! Truly what is the worst that could happen? Just peoples opinions which at the end of the day don’t mean much of anything.
Herpes,f3h3gt6,t3_dh1pg0,1570918584.0,I’m so sorry that you having herpes has led to this. That hurts my heart for you. Just go out and date. Meet people who have similar interests as you. Develop a connection and disclose when you’re ready. You can do this.
Herpes,f3fjqq9,t1_f3d9thw,1570898177.0,Well shit. That makes me want to get tested now. I have had like three outbreaks in three years and they’re always a cluster of like two or three very tiny (almost like pencil point size) bumps that look similar to a whitehead. I get the prodrome feelings in the area of the tingling but that’s really about it. Never had pain when urinating or anything.

Herpes,f2w3qzk,t3_dejqyg,1570460928.0,I hope for this so much! Congrats and I hope that it works out. ❤️
Herpes,f2lwhjy,t1_f2lomsb,1570298984.0,"I personally didn’t think railroading someone with information in the same breathe that I tell them I have it is the right way to do it. But that’s just me. I opened the conversation up and made it clear that any questions he had I could answer whenever he was ready. To me giving someone the option to decide they even want to have a conversation is better than cornering them face to face and pouring it all down their throats. People have their own ways of opening up and explaining it. If he’d have responded to my initial text then I’d have offered to take him to lunch so I could talk to him about it more in depth.
I’ve spoken to people about it previously and done it via text and face to face and they had no issue. This situation is just different because he didn’t allow for a continued dialogue on the subject. And I’m not going to force someone to sit and listen.
And yes. I mean disclose. Because I disclosed personal information about myself to someone. Not sure why that confused you."
Herpes,f2lvgbv,t1_f2lqxig,1570298644.0,It isn’t so much any devastation of losing “him” as it is just the rejection over all. Unfortunately for some people all the good qualities I have won’t overshadow the fact that I carry HSV and even though it is what it is; it still fucking sucks.
Herpes,f2lvald,t1_f2lmhtp,1570298585.0,"I understand that. I just felt like maybe I’d be in the wrong if I allow someone to get to know me and develop feelings without knowing exactly what they’re signing up for. Or even worse, I develop feelings and disclose and then the rejection is even worse because I had gotten attached."
Herpes,f2lv2v5,t1_f2lldib,1570298528.0,That’s a really good point. My train of thought honestly was that it’d be unfair of me to allow him to develop feelings for me when he doesn’t know everything up front. I do get what you mean though.
Herpes,f2likf5,t1_f2e9u5k,1570295196.0,Facts
Herpes,f2lidr5,t3_ddk36s,1570295137.0,My ex used to go down on me all the time and vice versa and we never transferred it to oral breakouts. We abstained from sex if either of us had a breakout.
SuicideWatch,f1evuhz,t3_d92gf2,1569431411.0,Maybe it was their time because they experienced a life worth living. And it’s not yet ours because we still have to find our own.

I’ll bring snacks."
SuicideWatch,ez4p2o7,t1_ez0ndbe,1567690112.0,Me too! But appreciate the good days because they remind you that it’s possible to be happy and at peace. Having off days is normal.
SuicideWatch,ez0n5e4,t1_ez0n12x,1567639186.0,"You’re so sweet, but I didn’t mean to make it about me. Just wanted you to know someone understood how you felt. It’s hard when you feel like no one understands."
SuicideWatch,ez0kuvz,t3_czpx3z,1567638215.0,"Pick up a pencil and grab a piece of paper.
Start a list.
Write down every thing you can think of that puts a smile on your face, evokes a laugh, or makes you excited.

Do you have a certain dog breed you’ve always dreamt of having?
What city have you always wanted to visit? Live in?
If you could learn one new skill, what would it be?

You’ll have two columns.
Things that bring you joy, and goals you can hope for.
Be honest. Even if they’re small things. They all matter.

Then hang up that piece of paper and read it every single day. Check off the goals you meet. Add new ones when you think of them.

I don’t care if it’s something as simple as buying some fancy chopsticks because you love ramen noodles or going to a local park and getting on a swing.

Do that. And then message me. And we can talk about all the things you discovered."
SuicideWatch,ez0jevs,t3_czr30j,1567637592.0,"This is literally my life right now. I just had my ex tell me yesterday that he will never be with me again because I’d slept with someone while we were broken up, even though he’d also done it.

I don’t have the magical answer to how to feel better. I’ve been skimming threads for a few hours now on how to kill my self also.

But if it helps you in any way, I know how that feels to love someone so much you can’t imagine life without them. It’s awful and feels totally hopeless.
But I’ve been heartbroken before this ex and I made it out. And eventually moved on.

It’s okay to be sad and hurt. 100%. And it’s okay to feel like you’ve run out of options to just make the pain stop.
However, you have to keep believing that one day you’re going to wake up and not hurt over him anymore.
You’re gonna find peace and comfort and self love. This life has sucked for Im sure every person walking this planet, but as many horrible things we feel, there are also amazing things.

Don’t go out tonight.
Stay home. Take a bath. Cook yourself dinner. Paint your toenails. Pick out a new comforter for your room or go to Walmart and buy a new house plant and repot it.
Anything you can do to bring some kind of calmness.
It won’t make it disappear completely, but it will remind you that there are an immeasurable amount of things that we can do to just feel OKAY while we work through our pain and hurt.
Let yourself be sad and mourn the end of the relationship.
And then remind yourself you’re fucking amazing and life holds so much more for you than just a heartbreak."
SuicideWatch,ez0iebu,t1_ez09h22,1567637157.0,Agreed. Grilling her isn’t going to help.
SuicideWatch,exflbnz,t1_exfl1ko,1566243058.0,Almost always. Some days are better than others but it’s on my mind throughout most of my day. Been struggling with this for 22 years. As time passes my reasons for continuing seem to grow less substantial.
BipolarSOs,esyeegr,t3_c9fhyf,1562342489.0,You guys are amazing. Thank you.
SuicideWatch,erxy8fw,t3_c4mrdc,1561396221.0,Nope. I’m worrying. What’s going on? Do you want to talk about it? I’m in a bad place too so I 100% know what it feels like to just be done with it all.
SuicideWatch,erxsmmj,t3_c4mrdc,1561392587.0,"They will not bill you upfront. Do you have insurance? I personally think a hospital bill is a lot better than ending your life. Go to the emergency room or call an ambulance. Do not do this. Please do not.
I totally get it. I’m there right now myself with just being done with it all but I’m telling you, there is always a happy day on the horizon. There is always a reason to keep going. You will not always feel like this.

Do you have a psychologist or take any medication for depression? Have you truly exhausted all options before you? Genuinely think about it. There’s so many more things you can do and a life ahead of you that is worth sticking it out for.

What are your dreams and goals? Do you want to own a business? Have you always wanted to have a German Shepherd? Do you really want to go see the Mayan Ruins in Central America or go scuba diving in Belize? These are all the things I tell myself. I want to experience them. I just have to pound the pavement to get myself there and every time I check a positive off my list and set myself up for success, that’s a good day. That’s a smile. Take it a minute at a time even if you have to.

You don’t have to do this.
So like I said, what kinds of things have you always wanted to do and haven’t gotten to yet?"

The best advice I can give right now is to sit down and really think if she is 100% the person you want. Why you cheated. All of it. Figure out the root of the issue and set yourself on a path to correct it and be a better person for yourself and potentially her.
I once forgave my ex fiancé for cheating on me and it was hard as hell but she probably just needs time to process it."
