The first time I was 7 years old living in a fucking tent. The second time I was 19. Ever since then Ive been working shit jobs and got scammed by a for-profit school so I have a degree that I cant use and no one will hire me. So im going back to school. Rent is too high and Ive barely been able to afford bills and I eat one fucking meal a day. Im trying to go back to school this year but i can barely afford books bc everything else is in the way. In 2017 I had a procurement job and was fired unfairly and ended up working at a fucking restaurant where I was sexually harassed and worked 14 hour shifts for 10 bucks an hour and no raise. By the summer I had to quit bc the manager was SERIOUSKY sexually harassing me to the point it became scary and I took a fucking housekeeping job just to make ends meet. Got fired from there two months later  a month before fucking christmas for something completely out of my control or knowledge and got stuck at a retail place where i average 20 hours for $9.50. Went to a fucking job interview for accounts payable position and although I had experience and scored well on the test, they told me I wasnt suitable for the position because I couldnt use correct fucking verbiage to describe the fucking position. The results from my test stated “strongly knowledgeable.” Theres some FUCKING humor for you. Im 26 years old and depressed and thoughts of suicide feels like sweet candy on the brain. People in my fucking family think my emotions are just “attention-seeking” but no my emotions are fucking real. Im tired of living this way. My parents are SHIT and I blame them for why my progress to launch as an adult has been stifled because im always having to look out for them and they cant support me or my brother PERIOD and they dont FUCKING want to. I live in an ugly ass fucking rural area where job opportunities are shit and im not sure if being a person of color affects ones opportunities or not but i am absolutely OVER any aspect of living. This has been going on far too long and life is complete SHIT and id consider prostitution or sugar baby shit just to make ends meet. I used to have a sense of decency but no seriously Id show u my fucking tits just to make $100 at this fucking point. And if you think this post is too intense then Im sorry but im under so much pressure and this is how my life screams at this point. Sorry!"
