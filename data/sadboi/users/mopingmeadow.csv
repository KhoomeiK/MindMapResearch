The second I use as what I like to think of as fanfiction scenarios of my own life. Basically, these scenarios are ones I’ve experienced in real life but I modify them so they’re better and ideal.

If someone could “legally” sign away their lives, I think there might be a decrease in suicides because as someone else said, people would more than likely have to visit health professionals first and *maybe* those certified to help could indeed help. If not, well the person contemplating suicide would die without being at risk of becoming a vegetable or traumatizing whoever walks in on their corpse. Being aided in death could also be good as (assuming the suicidee consented) their organs could be donated to those in need. Unfortunately this will never happen and people will continue to have to resort to horrible methods of trying to end their lives without being sure that it’ll actually succeed And be at risk of just ruining their entire lives should they fail"

I could’ve been fine but I also lost my online friends so I had no friends online or irl. I had never sat alone at lunch but did for the first time that year.

Grishaverse,fjo8d36,t3_fefmk9,1583522614.0,"I did enjoy King of Scars but I do agree with some of the points you made.

1. **The Darkling.** I honestly saw no reason for him to return other than the shock/plot-twist factor. Some characters need to stay dead and the Darkling is no exception. It’s not that I didn’t like his character, but we all know he’s going to end up dead by the end of the next book which invalidates his return even more. And honestly I don’t see why it’s necessary for him return. I know Fjerda and Ravka are going to war, but there’s no reason for them to resort to the Darkling’s power, especially considering the fact that he can screw them over at any point.

2. **Zoya.** I think Zoya’s a great character, but this book definitely felt like it was her’s rather than Nikolai’s. Not that it’s a bad thing, I would’ve been just as thrilled if Leigh had announced it would be the Zoya duology, but I was under the assumption that it was mostly going to focus on Nikolai, which obviously wasn’t the case. We see things being done to Nikolai throughout the whole book and it isn’t until the very end that he actually does something on his own.

3. **The Saints.** I do agree that the saint storyline messed with the mythology of the series. I feel like they should’ve just been the first Grisha who were martyred and nothing more. In general I didn’t like this storyline because it took Nikolai away from the real world and seemed to just waste his time. I did not like this.

Most importantly though, I do agree that the lack of politics was disappointing! I really think this was the most interesting part of the novel that got me the most invested. Take the chapter when Nikolai and Zoya started discussing his potential suitors. This was a very interesting part to me because not only do we get to hear more about the other countries, it gives us a glimpse to see what suitor has the most to offer to Ravka. Although Isaak was a great character (rip :( ), it was disappointing that Nikolai wasn’t actually making all these decisions and experiencing them himself. I know he chose to marry the Shu princess but had all the previous events not happened it would’ve been interesting to see how he actually reacted to each of the consorts. (I was always very curious to see the Fjerdan princess and why the Fjerdan King would want her to marry their greatest enemy—also, we’ve never gotten the Fjerdan king or queen’s name). Someone mentioned in another post that Dunyasha >!(the girl that Inej fought in CK)!< could’ve been a big part of this book and I agree. She could’ve perpetuated the uneasiness and instability of Ravka by being a supposed claimant to the Ravkan throne. 

Overall, I *did* enjoy KOS, but I thought and wished it would’ve taken a different turn, mostly concerning Nikolai’s storyline. Nina’s was fine and I can’t wait to see what’s in store for her in the next book"
