Christianmarriage,es6tyxz,t3_c68bmn,1561657268.0,"Love is not a feeling, in my perspective. It‚Äôs a commitment. The ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù of being is love will come and go, it‚Äôs the ebb and flow of marriage. I‚Äôd suggest reading ‚ÄúThe 5 Love Languages‚Äù by Gary Chapman, and encourage your wife to do the same. Have you tried explaining your feelings to her?

Now don‚Äôt approached her and say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt love you anymore‚Äù, that‚Äôs going to feed any insecurities she has and potentially cause a gap in the marriage. Just softly approach her and tell her ‚Äúhey sweetheart, when you have a moment can I talk to you about something weighing on my heart?‚Äù And then let her know ‚Äúlately, I don‚Äôt feel loved. Can you work with me to figure out why?‚Äù

It could be you don‚Äôt feel loved because your love language isn‚Äôt being met. It could also be that your wife doesn‚Äôt feel loved, so she has a hard time helping you feel loved. Marriage is an ever changing adventure where you and your spouse shed the old versions of you and become new creatures. It‚Äôs all about rediscovering each other and finding new ways to love one another. We take so much for granted when we‚Äôre in the thick of marriage 24/7, but time away can possibly rekindle longing."
