But sense naming out the obvious gay ones makes you uncomfortable because ""erotica"" let me point out something better. Haruka Tenou (Sailor Moon) is genderfluid. The Sailor Starlights (Sailor Moon) are also genderfluid. Haku (Naruto) is Trans (?) and Luffy  (One Piece) is only in love with adventure and treasure so we'll count him as ace. (Unless something changes.)  


There, is that less erotica for you since people can't just enjoy erotica even though it's one of the closest things we can have to representation besides Given, Sailor Moon, and Yuri On Ice which aren't erotica by the way."
