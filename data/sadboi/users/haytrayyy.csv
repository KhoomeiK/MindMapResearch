Unemployment,fqaha1v,t1_fpztjq0,1589219053.0,So I just called EDD with the number ending in 2511 and after 30 minutes I did get through to someone who said my certifications ending in weeks 4/11 and 4/18 were pending still because I had questions I sent that needed to be answered before releasing payment. The questions I sent were regarding my pending certs... anyhow she had to resolve those questions and then she released my payments. Itâ€™s been a month! I hope this helps?

Anxiety,fmdriqp,t3_fo6h6w,1585975731.0,"I struggle with severe anxiety, and it seems the more anxious I feel, the more depressed I get. This covid19 outbreak has been causing soooo much anxiety that I got chest tightness. The chest tightness made me paranoid that I had covid. Thinking I had covid made me more anxious, which made me more depressed. Being depressed has made me have crying spells every other day. Crying spells led to runny nose. Runny nose led to post nasal drip. Post nasal drip led to cough. Cough led to sore throat. Then I over think all of these symptoms... is it stress? Is it covid? Overthinking causes headache. All of the above led to more anxiety. The cycle starts over. :("
