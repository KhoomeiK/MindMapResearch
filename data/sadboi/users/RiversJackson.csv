3) Doesn't want M4A, and instead wants to leave 10 million uninsured because he thinks health care isnt a right!

4) fought for years to cut social security and welfare, which would affect millions of poorer individuals (ones that are just as talented and smart as white ones) and the elderly!

1) Pursing the Iraq war with little to no evidence for its justification. The apex of the military industrial complex and the reason why our country has had massive debt and also led to the NSA and surveillance of every day Americans becoming more commonplace. 

2) Damning an entire generation of students to debt from their schools. He likes to pretend he can back track on this now when he has been the one to cause the problem in the first place.

3) Most recently, being so openly for private health care he's willing to literally tell the American people that  a plan that leaves 10,000,000 uninsured is not only the right option but is the only practical option. Let's ignore the fact that he's practically in bed with insurance industry lobbyists, but he's the main reason why M4A is practically out of mainstream news discussion.

It can cause a ripple effect for all of those who are around them. I'm not saying that the two situations are completely comparable, but I think you're being a bit dense when implying SC not only did this because hes inherently a p.o.s, but that situations that lead to abuse cannot be remedied and people cant feel remorse for it.

You should not lose everything over something that happened so long ago especially when for the most part you have completely bettered yourself, which it's very obvious SC has.

I mean fuck, if Debra can wish he gets past his terrible behavior, shouldn't we all be a bit more understanding? Maybe not, but its better than petty reddit arguments that do nothing but jerk each side off until we forget about it."

SquaredCircle,f76zi3p,t1_f7516mt,1573439874.0,"He's intentionally framing his response in a way that comes off as insecure and very TNA-ish. He knows he's lying when they say AEW has bigger stars, he's misleading when he says they're beating NXT by a huge margin each week. He's not correcting any misconception, because there's 1) only a small part of the general wrestling audience that will read it and 2) working the fans who legitimately like WWE to a slightly larger extent than AEW. He's causing division amongst fans and directly contradicting his ""it's not a war"" spheal. It comes across in such poor taste because they make themselves sound very reminiscent of TNA in 2010. 

WWE not acknowledging them is getting such bizarre reactions lately. First it's the whole line about it just being better for wrestling in general and not a competition just because it's an ""alternative"". Then it suddenly becomes a petty and scared way and they're trying to pretend they dont exist because they want people to only think of them as the main wrestling company, which is entirely reasonable as much as AEW pushes they're just as good so I dont see how there can be an issue there.

Jericho and AEW know they're full of shit in what they claim to do, and their most successful guys are from the WWE. So they're attack-then-coward approach to how they are handling their mere existence in this industry is, well, petty and insecure."

SquaredCircle,f35qzts,t1_f2z1npf,1570686815.0,"Calm tf down man. Did you ever stop to think why exactly both men wouldn't be on the show? If you actually watched the so-reviled ending of the PPV you'd understand why both men should NOT have shown up. 

And...yeah? The company recognizes what they did wasn't popular so they're trying to sweep it under the rug. What....exactly is bad about that? Do they need to go on a big apology tour for the ending? Rollins and Bray talk to the crowd and have a pipe bomb 2.0? 

No. They did exactly what they should have done. They dont need to bring out their world champ to boos whem they dont need to. They dont need to directly apologize to the audience. They just need to realign and get over a (admittedly big) bump in the road, and drawing more attention to it makes NO SENSE, and I know you have to realize that.

Ironic really, cause if they did try to justify/explain/apologize for the ending of HiAC, I'm more than certain people would decry it as some sort of human right issue or something, like most of the shit this company seems to do anymore."

chemhelp,exuq1yc,t1_exukcpo,1566586950.0,"General is basically understanding stociometry and what different units are used for understanding particular properties of elements/compounds. There's very little organic in most courses, and in terms of inorganic there's typically only a discussion on Molecular orbital theory and Vesper theory. You'll also be introduced to physical chemistry topics like enthalpy, entropy, and thermodynamics in general.

Gen chem is a foundation that allows you to understand the elements, their basic properties and how they theoretically would react with one another, how much of a product would be formed, and things like what reactant would be used up first. It allows you to have somewhat of an understanding when you go more in depth in actual organic, inorganic, and physical courses"

Call it being wholesome or a clever heel or whatever but it's really annoying how these AEW guys spent months talking shit on every aspect of WWE and now that they are actually getting the ""war"" they talked about so long ago they're acting so melodramatic about the whole thing.

For fuck sake, they need to stop being TNA with the consistent underhanded mentioning and criticisms of WWE when there is absolutely no realistic way they can beat them right now, and instead should just be focusing on making a quality wrestling promotion. Otherwise it makes it glaringly obvious theyre way behind them. MLW and ROH don't do this and they are quality alternatives. At this rate AEW is just going to turn into another TNA.

And there's also the point that if anyone from WWE so much as said in passing about some aspect of going head to head with AEW they'd be labeled the heel billion dollar corporation trying to undercut the small indie fed that also has a billion dollar backer. It's a blatant double standard and its fucking annoying."
