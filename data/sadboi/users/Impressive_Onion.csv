I was able to focus entirely on the art until the last boyfriend. Everyone else was either one event or there was only one event I could remember. The last boyfriend was about 1-4 times a week. It was never ending, and I couldn't find the motivation for art anymore. I have staked my entire personality around my art and my desire to create, but when he came into my life and took that away from me, I didn't know how to be me anymore. I'm now just a husk.

They are thinking in the past, not the present. But let enough time pass, and they will realise there are no new memories there and that they've lost something.

AskReddit,ezssccr,t3_d1uyww,1568106946.0,"Anything of mine being slightly moved.

For example, I'm a manager at a pizza place. All the drivers have cards that have their codes programmed onto them so I can can check them in and out for deliveries. I keep their cards in a neat line, in order of first driver off to the two closers, with the black band holding the programming on the left side so all card are in the same direction. Sometimes, when it's busy and I can't be at the cut table, they will check themselves in and out. I don't mind that part at all. What I mind is how they just throw their cards onto the computer top. It messes with the entire order of things and causes me to panic and stress out.

I don't say anything because I don't want to seem weak or mentally compromised, seeing as I'm aiming to be a General Manager. I don't think it really is something that shows much other than my desire for order and neatness, and I don't yell or degrade my employees for things they do wrong/that annoy me. I.e., one of our part time cooks tends to slap pizzas together and not care about what the food looks like. One day, when it was a little slower, I saw her pepperoni pizzas were lacking pepperoni. I went over to help her, and at first she was defensive. So I gently told her I wasn't trying to put her down, and offered to have her come see her pepperoni pizza versus mine. She begrudgingly did, but when she did she finally noticed what I was saying. After that, her pizzas were coming out much more thought out and beautiful than before. I began to immediately compliment her and show her her cooked pizzas so she could see her improvement.

I do this with cleaning and prep with the drivers as well. I know I can be anal and annoying about my OCD, but I never force it down their throats. I explain to them why I see it as important, show them the outcome of what I want done, and then compare it to what they are doing. I never tell them or show them these things with negative reinforcement and don't yell at them if they forget. I gently remind and only ever get negative towards those who refuse to listen and generally do not care."

He told me this in the form of a letter shortly after he found out about my (at the time) 15 suicide attempts. I haven't seen or spoken to him since I graduated, but it's because I want the next time he sees me to be when I've matured and become the person he knew I could be."
