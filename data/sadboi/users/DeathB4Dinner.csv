UFC3,fr3wjiw,t1_fr3sscz,1589868291.0,"You right. I feel like I should work on grapple more, since buying this game I‚Äôve invested so much into my standup abilities, but when you take me to the ground your chances of getting me is there. Though I‚Äôve gotta say, I‚Äôm well with submissions, especially with Charles Oliveria. It‚Äôs just with different mounts and transitions I get absolutely fucked on. My opponent will be pulling and tossing my fighter around whilst my stamina is draining beating the shit outta me. I need more practice and more in depth understanding on the grapple I guess."
