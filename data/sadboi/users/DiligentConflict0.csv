BPD,ew3hkbq,t3_cmmhu1,1565079245.0,"I’m a guy and I can relate to many things you feel. My identity is really dependent on who I’m with at the moment. If I’m with my hippi-ish friend, then I’m a hipster. If I’m with my more elitist friend, then I’m an elitist and the thing is that I don’t pretend to be that way. I really feel like I’m that kind of person. And I somehow crave for attention, I crave for a compliment that will make my day. Because the way I see myself depends on how people see me. If I like a t-shirt, and someone says that they don’t like it, I’ll automatically hate that t-shirt and realize how ugly it is. If I think that my jeans is ugly, and someone says “wow it looks great”, then it’ll turn into a great piece of clothing before my eyes. I don’t know if you can relate with this, too. Also, when I enter to a coffeeshop etc, I love people looking at me, but somehow I’m irritated too because the reason they’re looking at me could be because I look fucking perfect, or I look fucking ugly. Because I don’t know myself. That changes when I’m with a cool friend entering to the coffeeshop, because when I’m with someone, I’m more confident and if people look at me that time, it’s probably because I look fucking perfect. I don’t know if it’s histrionic or borderline but this is how I feel. I crave for attention but I can’t take it at the same time."
BPD,ew2fc29,t3_cmf76n,1565045294.0,"It might have a little effect on your apetite, but you can manage this by keeping your diet healthy while making sure that you’re full enough. Also, for what did your psychiatrist prescribed Seroquel? For sleep, or the antipsychotic effects? I’m asking because I was prescribed Risperdal for paranoia, anger, tics and stuff like that, and it made me gain some weight which scared me a lot, so my doctor switched to Abilify, which didn’t have any effect on my weight. Maybe you should ask your doctor if there’s another option, if it makes you gain weight."

BPD,evre6gx,t1_evrd4bq,1564706440.0,"I’m sorry that you guys can’t laugh about it yet, but I’m sure things will get better between you two, and maybe you’ll laugh about it! But the thing is, it’s true that we can’t think so well during a fight, and say something we didn’t mean, or believe in something so much that it hurts the person you’re arguing with, because you want him/her to believe in what you believe and you get angry because he/she doesn’t.

BUT

This doesn’t mean that we’re never right in arguements. Of course, I don’t know the reason of your arguement but I recommend you to think about your arguement with your friend when you feel in a calm state of mind, and point where you might be right and where you might be wrong in it, and maybe do the same for your friend. Having BPD or any mental issue doesn’t mean that we’re always wrong. We just sometimes lose our temper and it might make us seem wrong, even in the situations that we’re actually right. 

Hope the best for your issue with your friend! :)"
BPD,evrchfi,t3_ckp49u,1564705453.0,"The last sentence is literally EVERYTHING to me haha. I sometimes read my conversations made during a fight, or listen to my own voice mails, and be like “WTF is that me? I don’t even care so much right now why did I react so badly?”.

I know this is exhausting because for me, it makes me so unsure if I’m right or wrong during a fight because I know that it might sound silly or pointless the other day. But everything I say means so right during a fight. Like calling my older sister “satanic” and “manipulative” just because she doesn’t care about me, or say things to my mom and older sister like “I want to cut out this toxic relationship between me and you guys, because your energies are so dark and I refuse to be in your dark energy circle and from this time, I’ll avoid toxic people like you in my life”. 

This happened two days ago and now we’re all laughing about it. The thing is, it made sense when I said that. It’s hard to understand. 

:)"
BPD,evra3dj,t3_ckudqv,1564704058.0,"Too much compliment bores me as well, but it never means that I’ll take any negative opinion about me all positively :) For me, there should be lots of compliments and some “no comments”. I live for compliments, I can say. A compliment, especially on my looks and attitude, will result in one or two very happy days.

But I totally get your point when you say “too much compliments mean no compliment”."
BPD,esx38ax,t1_eswximi,1562324724.0,"Hello there. Thanks for your answer. I know it’s selfish, and I know it always ends up bad. You probably know how it feels to crave physical and emotional attention, and when someone shows that to me, especially if it’s an older man, my mind almost automatically idealizes him, even though I don’t actually like him, maybe even degrade him inside my head which will show up eventually. Thanks by the way, I’ll check your post :)"
