I’m also a 13 year old girl who sews dolls. Granted, my dolls are definitely not as good as yours, but I still love them. Like many people said in the comments, you have so much talent and love to give to the world. People like you give me faith in humanity. We need way more people like that in the world. You are awesome and beautiful, and I hope you know that."
