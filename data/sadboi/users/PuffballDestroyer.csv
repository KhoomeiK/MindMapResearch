I also really like the soundtrack for Colors, but I feel that for me personally, Unleashed beats it because the composition and sound for its music did such a good job of enhancing the theme of the game (globetrotting around the world and visiting various countries) compared to Colors and the amusement park.

I also like majority of the classic music, but I tend to like remixes of it more than the original.

Edit: I'm slowly starting to get into f-zero, although I really like the track I've heard in smash Bros, but I also really love the Kirby series, especially in terms of music.
