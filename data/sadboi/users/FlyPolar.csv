I have some spare wood to use so I'm making a planter which will be approx 100cm x 40cm X 40cm.

The location is UK zone 8b and it is directly south facing without shade.

I just want something (or a selection) that will look nice, be able to handle lots of sunshine, and be able to be kept fairly small to suit the planter (I don't want a tree or hedgerow taking over the neighbours!).

I'm thinking a micro bish on each end and some flowers in the middle, but I have no idea what fits my criteria or if it's possible.

Hope you can recommend something."
