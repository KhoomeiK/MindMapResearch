I hate being so isolated, but I feel like I'm always going to let other people down, or they'll just get tired of me. Even if I manage to open up I don't really have anything to say. Good luck op, pm me if you want to talk."
ADHD,fjag1lv,t3_fcdenv,1583172752.0,"I feel like I can't really give advice on this since sleep and falling asleep is a huge struggle of mine. I found that what would sometimes help is trying to lucid dream. Look up guides, as i'm terrible at explaining things.  Basically you are trying to act as you are asleep, keeping perfectly still. Since you are so focused on that I found that it helps keeping my mind off of the million other things I normally think about. YMMV."

depression,ez4jml0,t1_ez3ju17,1567687859.0,"It took me far too long for me to accept that I used food as a way to cope. Food has always been comforting. I'd use it as a pick me up. As a reward for any small accomplishment. I'd eat out of boredom. It doesn't help that I'm a pretty good cook. It's one of the few things that I was always proud of. Like with everything else though I lacked discipline. I'd constantly overeat. I hate leaving my cave so when I would get something delivered I'd order huge amounts meant for multiple meals, but it wouldn't last."

Depression and anxiety have been a part of your life for so long that you feel comfortable being miserable. You've been rejected too many times. All the improvements you made, weight loss, working out, dressing better, and putting yourself out there felt pointless. You wasted your life and feel like it's all too late. You feel like you deserve this. Your greatest regret was not killing yourself before your birthday. Another year and you can't see things getting better. You just hope one day you have the strength and courage to end it."

I'm tired of always being the one that needs to try, that reaches out, that needs to keep things stable. I just for once in my life want the strength and courage to finally end it. There is no happy ending for me. Why drag it out longer? Just to suffer?"
