horror,facblqg,t3_e6bthh,1575936602.0,"So, I literally JUST finished Train to Busan, like 5 minutes ago. I can still feel my eyes radiating from all the fucking crying... Like, I’m a 20 year old dude who hasn’t cried since my dog died 3 years ago... and I have to admit, even then, I cried less than just now, which is meaningful because I usually feel closer to animals than humans.
Just, omfg, does this movie hate sensitive people or something? I was not prepared for this. I thought it would simply be a fun foreign zombie flick, not a dramatic masterpiece"

Reason being that it is an amazing game, including the gameplay, visuals, music/sound, AND story. Any part of it would make it worth it :)"
bloodborne,f9usk6c,t1_f9tvpee,1575656941.0,"Not everyone has the emotional capacity to keep trying to get through such a demanding game without any help. If I didn’t look up some tips myself I would’ve been long gone from the game, frustrated, confused, and impatient from having to start the same area over and over again. Some people respect their own time. I want to experience the entire game, but that ain’t gonna happen if I get stuck for hours on hours. I’m about two thirds through the game now and I love it. Getting some help from the internet really doesn’t hurt that fact."

Now i’m sad that it’s ended again haha"
