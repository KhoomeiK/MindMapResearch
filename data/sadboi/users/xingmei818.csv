They aren't available where I'm from. I might need to special order them. Haha

For the Beauty and the Beast remake, I think Disney really didn't even try.

There's this video on YouTube channel called Sideways and he discussed the music of Beauty and the Beast, wherein he discusses why it's so odd that Disney remakes' music don't work. One thing he mentioned is the use of nostalgia.

I think a similar thing happened with TROS (and he discussed TROS too, check it out. It's educational and entertaining about the soundtrack. He's a music guy hehe), and they used the nostalgia (Palpatine, Vader=Kylo Ren=death) as a plot point which the force awakens tried to dispel.

But like I said even though i rant and think about this all the time, I love Disney movies. I love the Star wars films. It's so hard. It's like having a child wherein they grew up so awfully and they're drug addicts and they're murdering people but they're still your child.

I can't completely boycott Disney hahaha"

reylo,fq08vt8,t3_gfqxc6,1589028914.0,"I think there's a part of me that wants him to be redeemable despite being so terrible.

It's a war right, and wars have casualties. He fought for his cause, however skewed his outlook was.

I think the reason Adam Driver really played Kylo so well was because he acknowledged the fact that Kylo believed in something that although was not good but in his mind was right.

I think in a way, an extremely ""bad person"" say like Hitler can become redeemable only if they turn back on their beliefs. Or a complete 180.

Accepting punishment or owning up to one's actions can help appease people, but there's always this thing inside me that believes everyone deserves grace. Even the worst of worst. Even someone like Kylo.

I even had a discussion with my uncle who suddenly for no reason said to us that, ""I don't think I'm convinced Kylo Ren is a villain.""

It brought me to tell him that Kylo Ren felt so inherently human. He's no longer the villains of yore that are so explicitly evil and one dimensionally evil. In the whole trilogy no matter how you look at the awful writing (sorry it is. It wasn't planned and it's frustrating to me), Kylo was a character that was always in a battle with himself.


In a way we all are. We are merely pawns of something or somewhere and we're all battling inside ourselves between what we deem good or bad.

Morality is getting more blurred because essentially humanity agreed on what is good and what is bad.

Thus, I don't think we have a say on who deserves redemption, and I think anyone deserves redemption.

Total purity is non existent, and  I think Disney played it safe when they killed Ben because they didn't want to show his redemption anymore.

The sequel trilogy is something that might be confusing to little kids though, and I really don't know how they intend to market or to show Kylo Ren anymore to kids.

How do you sell moral ambiguity or humanity to children and parents who need idealism?

Such a heavy topic. I've been thinking about this a lot.

I don't mean to offend anyone, but yeah these are all just my personal opinion.

I will love these series though. I'm so terribly attached to everything, and I will forever nitpick it. I plan to rewatch everything from the prequels soon, but yeah so far that's all I've got. Haha"

Are you particularly close with this sister?

If yes, you can try to tell her what you've told us here. I love my brother and he bears the brunt of my OCD meltdowns, and there are times when he gets very frustrated with me. I tell him that it's exhausting. I can't even describe what's going on in my mind because I myself don't know how to describe it.  He tries to understand, and sometimes it takes a good cry in front of him during a full blown meltdown to remind him that yes, I am ill. It's very hard to understand, and he tries to but i try not blame him if he can't.

If not, if she's done listening to your explanations, then just ignore. Find another outlet and if there's a behavior that becomes involved with her, I guess try to divert it elsewhere. There are times that we can't help it. The thoughts we have are so isolating that we sometimes come across as a bit selfish (I've been called this a lot during uni days), and there are times when people who just want to pick a fight will pick a fight. To those kind of people, I try to be polite and avoid.

I hope you find friends (not just from the internet, I'm here for you too despite that) that really listen to you.

My friends call me out when I over explain. They say that hey, Mei. It's okay. We understand. You're going through something tough.

Another tool that helps me a lot is this system my guidance counselor in college taught me.

It's called non-adversarial communication.

It goes like so:
Observation
Feelings
Needs
Request

So for example, when I'm concerned about my friend who seems to be angry at me I say

O - I *noticed* you weren't messaging me as often as you used to


F - I *feel* alone and unwanted


N- I *need* to feel secure again in knowing that were still friends


R- *may* I know if I've done something wrong?

This exercise helps me focus on what I noticed, felt, need to feel, and what I want to ask from another person.

It also acts as something to limit my brain from going beyond the realms in thinking ""oh God she hates. She's never gonna speak to me again. Maybe it's because I did that or said that or didn't get that. Etc."" In case I try to overexplain to someone because I felt bad.

This helped me get closer to my friends and weed out those who never really tried to understand. I really hope you find friends or family that are willing to understand you too.

I hope you are well. I'm praying for you."
OCD,fmrkh7k,t3_fwxe16,1586325983.0,"Try to ground yourself into reality by calling friends, and remembering how real they were to you.

OCD,fmrkeni,t3_fwxgkw,1586325919.0,"I feel for you. I've had this feeling too, and I usually have it when I'm tired + hungry + stressed.

The fact that you're feeling guilty about it now makes sure you won't do it.

I think the thoughts are exacerbated by being inside. Have you tried getting some sunlight? Or go outside a safe space with a mask? Also, other coping mechanisms you've held on to before quarantine?

Also, listen to your body. Are you sleeping well? Hydrated? Fed? Sunlight? Air (preferably opening a window to take out stale air from your room)?

Will you be able to contact a professional during quarantine? Some countries offer free tele-medical services via zoom or other conference platforms.

I'll be praying for you."
OCD,fmriqok,t1_fmrggf7,1586324435.0,"Thank you for your conceen.

It's really hard when we're idle. I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels like my brain is searching for sadness.

It really helps to be proactive. At least you caught yourself earlier on.

I hope you're well! Thank you again for your concern."
OCD,fmrieyx,t3_fwxujf,1586324152.0,I hope you're feeling better. It is valid that you were experiencing such things during a hard time.
OCD,fmrh904,t3_fwzkes,1586323139.0,"First, I can't believe your parent said that. (...Not going to college despite people dying...)

Second, I think it's alright to compartmentalize what you're feeling if it helps keep you sane. Our grief towards the masses and our fears for those close to us are normal.  Parent asked you a question, and you answered about what you were thinking about. I think it's unfair that your parent answered in that manner.

Third, it's normal for people with OCD to overthink, and I have felt what you're feeling about worrying that they think you're a bad person. I still overthink about things I've done when I was in 1st year college (2011) despite being a graduate by now and a registered and licensed architect now (2020).

I guess what helps me cope with this tendency is to remember that we don't hold our opinions of others in our hands. I have a tendency to explain to others my intentions despite them actually not really caring about what I did.

We can only hold our own brain, and we have no business what other people think of us.

Also, try to forgive yourself. Acknowledge that sure you felt that you were tactless (but I really don't think you were). Your emotions are valid. You told this parent the truth. You had an easier time with classes. That's a truth for you.

But, if you want to explain to your parent, that ""parent, I'm just trying to survive. I'm worried about your safety... (Etc. And what you posted earlier"" go on ahead if it makes you feel better. I hope this parent will venture to understand and not judge."

I won't discuss at length but yes. I feel for you."
OCD,fmrgcdd,t3_fwyp4z,1586322377.0,"Hmm perhaps it's just my internal monologue.

I think the self can be composed into different categories right and it's healthy to have a relationship with the self.

---morbid example coming through---

My central or core obsessive thought is I don't deserve to live in this world, and when I'm in my darkest episodes, my monologue would say, ""it will be better if you just off yourself"" and my rational trained side would say ""this thought is not a fact. Death is not the solution.""

I don't really think it has a different voice. Just my voice with different ideologies. It's normal I think. Not only in OCD.

But I guess in OCD we tend to act on that voice. ""Okay. You won't off yourself but we can always cut to remind yourself you're alive."" Then I cut. Etc. Or I bruise myself or whatever happened that day.

*Note: I'm no longer cutting or hurting myself. This was my past experience. My rational trained side would often take over after one day of overthinking or once I've spoken to someone about it."

Thank you for sharing your thoughts.

I was initially so productive during the first week of quarantine and now at it's third week, I'm so burnt out. I'm tired I'm low I'm so depressed I can't bear to work anymore.

Mental illness can color your memories that way.

Having a journal helps. Specifically a gratitude journal. I usually remember bad things without prompt but little notes about ""hey! The teacher loved your work today."" Helps me remember that I felt happy at some point in my life."
depression,fmrakxw,t3_fwst3m,1586317893.0,"I'm sorry your support system is not letting you open up. We're here for you. I hope it will give you comfort that someone out there would be willing to give you a hug.

I hope you find a therapist. Most people aren't equipped with the skills to understand depression nor do they want to. You can also ask your therapist about support groups.

One last digital hug. Keep safe and healthy."

mentalhealth,fmr9wji,t3_fwywcx,1586317398.0,"You said that you can push through something when you remember:

- why you have to do it
- till when you need to do it

Well, for why - it is to safeguard your health and the health of others who are most vulnerable. You're saving your neighbors. Your neighbors' neighbors. Your elderly family members. Your friends' elderly family members when you're in isolation

For, till when - we need to stay in isolation till the curve is flattened. It is sad that there is no concrete way to say when, and I'm sorry I have nothing more to add except that it will end. One way or another something has to end. If we look at history, even the Spanish Influenza ended. Hopefully, humanity finds a way to survive.

For books - I recommend:
1) Project Gutenberg- where you can find public domain books for free! You can read online or download on your phone or Kindle.



2) Scribd - they have a promo where it's free for a month. They have numerous new audiobooks and books to choose from but con is you can only read where the app is installed or on your desktop.



3) novel12 - an illegal site but haha if you want to read free a little bit modern books it's there



4) poetry - poetry resources are so vast. There are so many available platforms like the poetry foundation and YouTube channels like Ours Poetica, or channels that read poetry



5) contact your library, perhaps they have an app that you can install. I'm from the Philippines and the concept of a public library doesn't exist and I hope you have one in your country because I've read in articles that you can have an app like Libby where you can borrow ebooks!



For food:
Hmm since we're on lockdown, have you considered try making your own chocolate of you're capable? It's a new skill, and it would be rewarding as well. I used to stress bake when I was in college, and it feels meditative to make brownies or mould chocolate. Hopefully the markets you go to still have chocolate.

You can also make your own latte-s put on some cafe music and imagine you're in a cafe. I know it sounds ludicrous but conditioning your mind to be put in the same place helps.

I hope this helps you. This has helped me so much since I've been stuck home since March 17. It's been sad for me too to not be able to buy new books I've loved.  It's alright to take a step back and immerse yourself in something else.

It really is hard to do. I'm so burnt out with working at home. Hopefully we'll all get out of this together."

mentalhealth,fmr8sp7,t1_fmpomnd,1586316616.0,"I hope you feel better now. I'm sorry for your loss of a friend too.

Know it isn't your fault. Suicide is no one's fault. It's an illness kinda like a cancer of the mind. We can only do so much. Even those who have been in therapy for so long can end up dying by their own hand.

I've been in therapy for three years now and counseling for eight years. I've been actively suicidal since I was fifteen, and I'm 24 now turning 25 in August, and I'm still feeling like it's an option. Rationally, I know it won't help anyone, but it's a really hard thing.

It truly is a chronic illness."

mentalhealth,fmpeigq,t3_fwj43q,1586279412.0,"I have OCD too and one thing that helps me is thoughts are not facts.

What ever you're feeling towards the memory now is not fact. Even the memory you have of the memory is not fact since it's been colored by your bias.

I think it helps to see memories as just, ""ah yes I did that. And that happened.""

Even if it's so hard to do, it's worth a shot. I have a lot of shame from my childhood (including forcing a boy to love me in front of my class at 13 resulting in me becoming a social outcast) and they tend to make me who I am today.

My psychiatrist says to approach thoughts with a gentle curiousity. Try asking yourself, why you feel that way, what you felt before, and what do you plan to do with this feelings today.

Move forward? Learn?

*Edit: I wrote this at 1am and I forgot to write that you should forgive yourself too. It's so hard to forgive yourself the most because we don't have a lot of sympathy for ourselves. It's a conscious thing. I used to feel so shameful about being a person who cries a lot. Stressed = cries. Happy = cries. Angry = cries. When I forgave myself for being such a ""crier"", it made me feel more at ease.

I hope you're feeling well. Keep safe and healthy."

reylo,fmp0zy0,t3_frm2vh,1586272334.0,"Hi. I've been thinking about this a lot as well.

With Kylo Ren and Rey, a part of me wants them to become together because I want Kylo Ren to be ""saved."" There's a part of him that wants to be redeemed and falling in love is some kind of redemption.

I think it's similar to a lot of Draco-Hermione shippers in the Harry Potter series because you just want someone who's textbook cruel to be redeemed. What Harry says to Voldemort is he is stronger than him because he can LOVE.

Similarly, I want Kylo Ren to have some sort of healing moment through love because love conquers all.

Writing it down, it sounds so simplistic, but truly, I felt that Kylo despite his tendency to kill (I couldn't forget it when I was defending reylo to my brother) and ""sin"" was just really broken.  In the end, I think it resonated so much because even we are broken, and falling in love with someone like Rey who despite questioning her own identity and her morals, still put her hope in Ben/Kylo as well. I think it just felt so human.

A part of me loved TROS, and despite the ending being the death of Ben Solo, I found it was the only way Ben / Kylo would be redeemed without a need for a fourth movie.

Reading fix-its for TROS made me realize that the damage Ben has done as Kylo Ren was indeed large, and explaining it to children that ""Nooo we redeemed Ben because Ben helped Rey defeat palpatine etc"" without killing him off like some sacrifice would be too hard for Disney.

Thank you for reading this long reaction. I just really resonated with your question, and I've been mulling this over since I started reading fanfic (aka after watching TROS HAHA)."
