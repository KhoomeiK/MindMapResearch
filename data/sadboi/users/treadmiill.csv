AmItheAsshole,fj6q5ac,t3_fbpy2c,1583077736.0,people seem to realize on this sub that being an asshole isn't just about following the obligations but it's also about being a mature person. of course you don't owe her anything and you don't necessarily HAVE to do these things to other people. but the same applies to let's say attending a friends wedding. you don't have to go there necessarily but you go to support your friend. life isn't always about doing only what you really HAVE to do. it's bad that some people expect us to do certain things and are ungrateful for other people. life isn't just about that. some times you just gotta forgive and spread love even if it seems not technically necessary.
