refrigeration,fi7ewrw,t3_f6w3iy,1582220064.0,Thank you. So if the curtain switch needs replaced it would read as a full bin?
juul,ffbeuqg,t1_ffbe58j,1579762258.0,Yeah these are 100% counterfeit
BodyDysmorphia,ff5eug1,t3_erotoq,1579589842.0,Not married but I truly hope you figure it out. I don’t think I’ll ever have a wedding honestly.. but I’d love to get married. I hope you enjoy your day ❤️
Empaths,fem1bev,t1_feghsw2,1579236546.0,I saw your post and added it to my story! Your work is awesome :)
Empaths,fegc8df,t1_fefbvpe,1579087281.0,"I followed you but couldnt find this particular image on your feed, do you mind if I post this on my story? Of course with credit to you!"
juul,fegc2l7,t3_eoxp83,1579087074.0,"This whole thing is so fucking lame. We have mr. Fog, unique pods, and the other million off brand compatible pods on a million flavors - but in my experience these off brand pods make me feel like trash and cause me to cough constantly. My juul pods do not do that so what is the difference exactly? I feel like those pods are way worse for us than the juul. So why is juul stopping the sale of all of the different flavors but these other companies continue to flourish with cheesecake, blueberry, skittles, and every other flavor? Makes no sense to me. If menthol becomes unavailable in my area (only menthol and tobacco available now) I will be quitting. Which is a good thing.. but still just annoying. It’s like they just want everyone to go back to cigs. I never smoked cigarettes and won’t if I quit juul, but a lot of people quit cigs with their juul so I just feel for those who will unfortunately turn back to cigarettes."
publichealth,fefutcc,t1_fe2n2ki,1579065897.0,"Thanks!! That appears to be the case in my community. Very small and the two most popular restaurants are owned by a family who is heavily involved in the local government and city boards. I worked at one of the restaurants for over a year and we almost were shut down for so many violations, nothing ever changed but nothing ever came about it. No reports to the public or anything. So many people I served there became sick, and after enough bs combined with that I finally left."
publichealth,fe0hn3u,t1_fe0gum7,1578813576.0,Thank you! I figured they would be easily accessible online as all of the surrounding counties records are but I’ll look into this.
bipolar,fe0gw90,t3_encbw8,1578813254.0,No problem! I see it everyday sadly. It’s the main reason I deleted twitter. Twitter is a cesspool for this type of stuff.
bipolar,fe0ghhy,t3_encbw8,1578813059.0,"Same thing with people who think they have anxiety or depression when they don’t. Sadly it’s become trendy to have mental health issues... and while I’m all here for talking more openly about our mental issues, it’s ridiculous when so many people are claiming this and that but have never seen a doctor or even thought about seeing a doctor."
PedoGate,fe0g15x,t3_enjfkd,1578812815.0,The last one as well
PedoGate,fe0fzok,t3_enjfkd,1578812795.0,First twitter link doesn’t exist anymore :/
Embroidery,fe0fv3q,t3_enhkza,1578812734.0,LOVE THIS. So creative.
EatingDisorders,fe0f2bg,t3_en6ash,1578812290.0,"Wish I could help. I have the same issue with looking in the mirror. I don’t even want to know how many hours a week I spend there, usually picking my face and making it look 1,000,000 times worse than it did before. Just know you aren’t alone. Good luck on your journey and take care of yourself. You deserve it ❤️"
restaurantowners,fe0es1m,t1_fdp3qx8,1578812100.0,"We used toast at the last restaurant I served at. I can’t speak for set up and the managerial side of it, but as a server it had it’s annoying issues like any other (specifically when you send an order it logs you out automatically) but it is A LOT better than many of the other ones I’ve used when I served. Super user friendly. Me and hubby are opening a restaurant now and went with square for restaurant."
restaurateur,fabquae,t3_e7a21s,1575927335.0,Some people want to see others fail. They will go and leave the worst review they possibly can to try and hurt you or your business bc they’re trash who hate their own personal lives.
mentalhealth,esjnysp,t3_c82gks,1562037485.0,❤️ everything will get better.
vegan,esjn9h1,t3_c820cc,1562037000.0,Awesome!
BodyDysmorphia,errw0cr,t3_c3mbjn,1561186062.0,I feel the same way. And when people tell me I look skinny I just grow very anxious thinking about the possibility of gaining any amount of weight.
BodyDysmorphia,errvskh,t3_c3gbli,1561185771.0,All too relatable...
vegan,eqzl13i,t3_bzu3gf,1560401913.0,Tim hortons here in US is usually never good.
