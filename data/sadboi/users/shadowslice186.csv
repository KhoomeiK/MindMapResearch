He worked construction all his life and just wants to see me succeed, and I know doing something would just ruin him."

iPadPro,fonm7dk,t1_fonj8mg,1587922172.0,Ups is going a great job for you? I got mine from apple and it shipped with ups. And when I talked to support they said they were mostly fine on their end and ups was being the problem right now with delays

ipad,foibll7,t1_fod7vyq,1587782897.0,Did yours ship? I ordered mine the same day as you and had the same estimated delivery day. It just shipped tonight and it says estimated delivery is May 5 through UPS now.. probably going to try to call support for someone tomorrow
iPadPro,fobhc7d,t3_g6p637,1587659803.0,"Those days should be about right. Shipping is pretty messed up right now but it seems like lost people have been getting it on the last day of their estimated window, so you might have to wait until the 8th sadly.

The pencils are going fast, I got mine two days after I ordered, but there's a massive backlog on the iPads for whatever reason"
iPadPro,fnpto0r,t3_g38arb,1587151800.0,"From everything I've heard they're expected to come back in stock fairly soon, but with the coronavirus right now even that's up in the air. 

There's been a few posters in the last couple days saying they just sold theirs so hopefully there'll be some in a bit though.

I'm in the same boat as you, hoping they get some soon. For now I'd recommend using https://refurb-tracker.com/ , they'll send you an email as soon as it's back in stock."

He's very healthy right now, but I saw online pictures of trees with very tall braids, where as my guy has just a few so far and I didn't know if there was anything special I needed to do to keep that up?"

I do agree that they have some of the best coffee I've ever had though, I used to get their Thin Blue Line brand and it was amazing."
