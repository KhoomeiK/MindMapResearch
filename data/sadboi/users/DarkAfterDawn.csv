relationship_advice,fn6ram5,t1_fn6nwy1,1586705775.0,"I think they were both insecure to be honest and that is based on my own observation and not his words. And I do sincerely believe he felt abused.

relationship_advice,fn6qq2e,t1_fn6qe86,1586705438.0,"That‚Äôs true and I will make a plan for how to convince him to get proffessional help without me taking all the responsibility. If he still decides not to, I will make it over with him"
relationship_advice,fn6nqpq,t1_fn6mq4s,1586703627.0,Half a year was also an example. I think it‚Äôs more realistic to say 3-4 months cause then he has time to find a therapist.

And thank you :)"
relationship_advice,fn6n2nf,t1_fn6m72m,1586703211.0,I agree with you. That is also why he gets this one last chance before I feel like I have done everything to try and make our relationship work
relationship_advice,fn6mv58,t1_fn6lxtl,1586703081.0,"That is an excellent idea! I have been to a therapist myself (general anxiety) which has helped me a lot and he has noticed that. I hope this can motivate him as well as my experience has only been positive. I have already mentioned this, but he might listen if I say that I will go with him."
relationship_advice,fn6ml0n,t1_fn6l7bb,1586702905.0,"You are absolutely right. As I have stated in another comment, I consider telling him directly that if he does not get help within a certain timeline (for example a couple of months) I can‚Äôt be with him anymore. I have talked to him about getting proffessional help but he‚Äôs very scared of it (I know this is not an excuse)

He is aware of his behaviour towards me and that is also one of the reasons he is suffering (still not an excuse). I think it is also because he thinks that when he and I live together, have kids, a house etc. everything will be perfect and therefore things as they are now are not perfect. But I don‚Äôt think he realises that me being there will not fix his insecurities, problems with his friends etc."
relationship_advice,fn6m3qq,t1_fn6le4b,1586702600.0,"No it‚Äôs not and I agree with you.

It was emotional abuse. I was friends with him shortly after he broke up with the recent (the least bad) and I also got to meet her once. She didn‚Äôt seem kind to me, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that she was as abusive as he feels like she was."
relationship_advice,fn6lwc5,t1_fn6l27s,1586702469.0,"I really do believe he was abused cause I knew him right after he got out of his latest relationship. 

I have already talked to him about therapy, but he‚Äôs scared of it (I have said that they are professionals and don‚Äôt judge). I have considered telling him something like ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt get help within half a year then I can‚Äôt be with you‚Äù (said in a proper way ofc)"
relationship_advice,fn6laxe,t1_fn6ks2j,1586702083.0,"I have already suggested this but he does not want to as he is scared of talking about it with a stranger. I have already told him that they are proffessional and they won‚Äôt judge him.
Since he has not listened I have considered giving him a period of time and for example say that if he has not sought help or gotten better in another way within for example half a year, I can‚Äôt be with him anymore."

In my case it helped to continously tell him it was a really bad idea and that he was risking his life and that I would be very sad to lose him. After repeating myself a lot, the message finally sinked it and the trip was cancelled. I think the fact that we are in the middle of a pandemic is difficult to realise for some people, so maybe that‚Äôs why it helped.

If I were you, I would have a conversation with him where you tell him calmly that you guys are all okay with his new life style and you support him. But also that he needs to understand that you are not in any way interested in participating and give concrete examples of this, such as: He does have every right to be in the living room, but so do the others in the house and everyone should accept what the others are doing while being in the living room since it‚Äôs all four‚Äôs property.

I would also tell him that cancelling your TV is way over the line. How would he feel if you forced him to look at social media? 

Above all, I would not back down. Tell him that you guys are friends and that you really appreciate him, but that you have your own views on the world and that it‚Äôs not okay for him to interfer with yours. You want to be there for him, but it can‚Äôt continue if he does not accept your way of living.
