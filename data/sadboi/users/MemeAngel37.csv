I did have PTSD for a couple years actually, but I thought I’d worked past it. I was never able to address exactly what happened, but with my antidepressant and support from a great friend it slowly got better. I wouldn’t say I’m 100% healed but I thought it wasn’t a problem anymore. 

And while I’m still ranting about it, I’m trying to work with a self esteem issue where I loved someone but always thought I had to be on their level or “good enough” for them to notice me. Which I guess in hindsight is pretty damaging, but I thought I was doing ok with that too.

One that helped me out recently was “why do I feel this way right now/why did I feel that way back then?” It’s something you may not know the answer to, but approaching it slowly and carefully may help you figure something out. 

It’s not quite the same as “getting to the root of the problem”, more like taking one thing that happened and figuring out its effects, and going from there. I went back to the beginning of my problems (I’ve experienced lots of depression, severe anxiety, and C-PTSD) and tried to identify certain events, how I felt about them then, and how I feel about them now.

You may not know the answers, and sometimes the answer is just brain chemistry and there’s not much that’ll change without a chemical change, like medication. It’s ok just to be having a bad time- don’t push yourself to think about anything you’re not ready to. Hang in there, there’s always a solution."

During a panic attack, probably one of the best things to do is stay with them and wait for them to calm down, and for some people a comforting touch, pressure, or something to hold on to helps to ground them (it does for me at least.) Panic attacks can be scary but they will normally peak within 10 minutes and die down. And they’re so exhausting that it’s ok if your friend needs to be alone or avoid doing anything afterward. If they want to discuss anything that might have triggered the attack, just listen and understand as best you can, because even really normal events can set off anxiety for some people while others may not react to them at all. Don’t pressure them into talking if they don’t want to, but make sure they know they can count on you and encourage them to take care of themselves even if it might be hard."
