When I learn how to do it, I'd like to incorporate web scraping real time population data to add things like the country you may statistically be born in, etc. As far as I know, I've built it in a scalable fashion that will make it fun to work on as I add more skills to my repertoire.

This is one primary cause of my misunderstanding. I was looking at two variables called **word** and missing the forest for the trees.

After reading u/SoNotRedditingAtWorks reply mentioning that I did not include the outer scope of the code I used, wheels started turning. The exercise called for the following lines to be entered into python directly.

    1 import ex25
    2 sentence = ""All good things come to those who wait.""
    3 words = ex25.break_words(sentence)
    4 words

I changed the *words* variable on line 3 to *argv* and ran through the rest of the drill substituting *argv* and *argv1* for the variable names printed in the book. I could see what you so beautifully summed up above. 

Thank you all so much for your assistance with this. You were all super quick on the draw and I feel like the blockage has been pushed through. I'd hug you if I could.
