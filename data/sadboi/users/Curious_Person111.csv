Some foods, like milk, are fortified with vitamin D, but even if you drink 3 cups of milk a day, says Pritchett, you’ll still fall far short of the 600 IUs that current recommendations advise for people between the ages of 1 and 70.

The best way to be sure to get enough of the nutrient is to go outside and get some sun. When the sun’s ultraviolet rays hit your skin, that light triggers the production of vitamin D in your body. To benefit, you don’t need to -- and, because of [skin cancer](https://www.webmd.com/melanoma-skin-cancer/melanoma-skin-cancer-clinical-trials) risk, shouldn’t -- sunbathe. Instead, Todorov recommends only 10 to 15 minutes, two to three times a week between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.

“Expose yourself, then put on your [sunscreen](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-366/sunscreen+topical/details),” she says."

That's the reason I wear sunscreen in the first place. Thank you. And what do you mean sunscreen could give you vitamin d? You mean if you go out in the sun with sunscreen spf 30 you get vitamin d anyway? Is it better to go out in the sun with sunscreen that to avoid it all together? Are there any studies?"
SkincareAddicts,flddcfx,t1_fld0ko6,1585062183.0,"I'm sorry, but I stopped listening the moments she said you can get enough from food and suplements. That's simply not true. If this was enough, there wouldn't be so much vit d deficient people. Supplements are good, but not as effective as actual sun. I've looked at a lot of videos, this was one of them. I have anxiety and avoiding the sun like the plague only worsened it. I want some balance in life. But thanks for suggestion :) I also meant something specific, like for example: wear spf 20 or go out for this amount of minutes or some studies. She is a dermatologist, but not a doctor. I think I might ask my doctor."
