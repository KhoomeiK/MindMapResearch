brooklynninenine,foocrav,t1_fomqzgl,1587936675.0,I finally just watched the New Girl crossover episode. Now I understand why Jess was freaking out about the soup! From the B99 side I thought she was being so inconsiderate because he was trying to catch a criminal hahah
brooklynninenine,fom7cab,t1_fom6zmv,1587880442.0,Season 5 Episode 17 when Jake meets his half-sister! It’s the one where he sings Backstreet Boys in the cold open :)
brooklynninenine,foln64s,t1_folk0fc,1587865908.0,"Is it weird that I rooted for her over Jess?! Hahah I know what you mean about Jess dragging the show down. The Office and B99 had a good cast all around. I don’t know if you watch Community, but that’s one of my favorites too!"
brooklynninenine,folip6n,t1_folfs1b,1587863075.0,Couldn’t agree more. New Girl was good the first three seasons and then I liked when Megan Fox came on too. But I think B99 stayed funny! Or at least had enough funny episodes in a season to keep me going :)
brooklynninenine,folfcq1,t1_folejhf,1587861026.0,Wow you are on it! Impressive lol
brooklynninenine,folf1rh,t1_foleth2,1587860840.0,Thank you! :)
brooklynninenine,folbpbb,t1_folbj4j,1587858842.0,Whoa really? When is the one in New Girl?
BPD,f6y9u4k,t1_f6xih6o,1573272128.0,You will get there. I had a hard time after break ups too and no social network to help me through it. But after some time it felt nice that I only had myself to worry about. Now I’m a little worried about getting back out there because life has been so peaceful haha. Anyway I hope you find that feeling soon :)
lucifer,f6lcu70,t1_f6kahdw,1572938190.0,"She really did. I think she’s had the best arc out of all the characters. She’s too good for Eve, but it would be interesting to see if the writers make anything out of it."
friends_tv_show,f6lckzm,t3_drq5sm,1572937830.0,"There were some parts I liked like when they went on a date in season 8. It was cute and they had good chemistry and it seemed very genuine in my opinion. Then it got weird when he “accidentally” proposed to her and then a season later they tried dating.. like the timing was so weird because she had just had a baby with Ross. The Barbados episodes were definitely cringey cuz they were doing everything behind Ross’ back. I didn’t hate it, but I’m glad they ended up as friends."
friends_tv_show,f61790g,t3_dq62ux,1572634735.0,Monica was just an annoying character so that ruined the couple for me. She was always bossing Chandler around! He was way more fun before they got together.
howyoudoin,ewdehte,t1_ewddn9a,1565299452.0,Also when she’s “Monana” lol. I think it was only season one really.
howyoudoin,evdz94a,t1_evdys7p,1564451291.0,Oh yeah you’re right! The one where she wants to have a fling and he asks all his coworkers right? That’s a good one :)
brooklynninenine,evdy9cc,t1_evdiqb8,1564450565.0,I liked the crime scene episode even though it felt very different from the rest. Jake and Rosa together is always good though. And all her hairstyles lol
BPD,etawkqp,t3_capyje,1562631052.0,"Don't be so hard on yourself :/ You're trying your best and that's all you can do. I think the right people will stick with you through the tough times because they understand it's a mental disorder and not something you're doing on purpose. But you should really work on loving yourself as well! Easier said than done for sure, but being self destructive stems from viewing yourself in a negative light to begin with. I don't know if this helps at all, but I'm only saying it because I often feel the same way and this is what gets me through it. But you are definitely worthy of love and you will find it! Hang in there :)"
