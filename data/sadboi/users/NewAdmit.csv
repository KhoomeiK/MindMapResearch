 If you’re young/ young-ish you’ll have a great time.  It’s basically like a large dorm room with other people around(ish) your age.  Some are coed some aren’t.  If you’ve never had that experience it’s pretty interesting.  

I saw hostel when I was in early middle school/ late elementary and it scarred me up till 23 and I can only say that I regret having given them a chance earlier in life.

The more you work out your heart the stronger it becomes making it more efficient at circulating blood through the body. 

So how come when you elevate your HR through caffeine it doesn’t “workout” and have similar health benefits to the heart as when you workout your heart through cardio.?"

If you really want to transfer to a UC and If you don’t mind taking an L for this semester I would talk to your counselor and talk to them about dropping out.  After you’ve dropped out, going to a CCC to earn your AA, AS/ ADT is your best bet.  

Going to a community college to earn your 2-year degree places you in a separate pool of applicants from everyone else not applying from a CCC.  In short, you have a much higher chance of getting in to a UC as a 2-year degree transfer than anyone else who applies.  

If you do decide to go to a CCC look at there TAG (Transfer Agreement Guarantee) programs - each CCC is different.  

85%+ of CCC graduates transfer to a UC"
BPD,f0352fj,t3_d3fq81,1568345008.0,"Hi,

&#x200B;

I recently just went through this with my current girlfriend. Almost the same exact situation; basically telling her that I overanalyze almost everything she says/ texts me and that I needed her to know how big of an impact the things she says to me has on me - both negatively and positively. 

&#x200B;

But on the contrary, someone told me that I shouldn't put all that responsibility on her and that I need to find coping mechanisms so she doesn't have to walk on egg shells. So I told her that while I will work on not taking things so personally/ overanalyzing things the way I have been. 

&#x200B;

Also, I recently I spoke to my therapist about this (naturally) and she told me that its okay to have these thoughts, to which I replied, ""yeah, but they're emotionally exhausting"". She told me that my thoughts are only exhausting because I fight them so hard, and that if I allow them to just pass through me I'd notice just how easier it is to cope.

&#x200B;

Hope this helps."
