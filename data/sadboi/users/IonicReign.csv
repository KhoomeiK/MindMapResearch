Passive dating means that the guy is trying to impress you to give him a shot, but then once he's impressed you, he's now waiting for you to show interest back and show off how you would be an excellent long term partner. 

I'm not sure if you're successfully showing off your other 'non-trophy' assets. 

A simple solution might be for you to take the lead on a date (maybe not the first one if you're uncomfortable, but maybe the third or fourth date).

But, as all cheaters do, she opted for the cowardly selfish option. She wanted what she liked in the moment and was willing to risk your relationship to obtain it.

What are you hoping to gain from this? To prove how little you care about your brother?

 To win back a woman who's shown herself to be such an attention sponge that: she forced out of you her feelings for her so she could tease you and lead you on, who while married, and engaging in an emotional affair with her husband's brother, she went off and fucked someone else because destroying a relationship with two brothers wasn't enough for her? Do you really want a woman that spreads her legs for the tenth customer to hit on her? 

Dude you need to be helping your brother heal and stop thinking with your lower head. She's hot but she sounds unstable, immature, and untrustworthy. 

You call yourself a writer? Here's an exercise. Try to write about the betrayal from your brothers perspective to understand his pain at both her and you, and work out that she's a selfish monster. Take her off the pedestal. What the fuck is wrong with you. 

Don't send it. Grow up."

So anonymous sex meet ups, cam girls, massage parlors, and prostitutes are all possibilities now or in the future. Maybe take a look at those credit card statements too... 

It seems to stem from him being unable to control his physical impulses more than wanting to fulfill an emotional need. He needs professional intervention at this stage. Therapy. 

His behaviour is worrying and your sexual health could possibly already be compromised. I'd get an STI panel just for peace of mind."

Infidelity,flx3kb6,t3_frhb3f,1585574200.0,"I think it's a bit less black and white then what everyone is saying. You absolutely do not need to defend her cheating. If she feels guilty about being harshly reminded of her actions, and you feel zero need to shield her from that 'hurt' (after all, why should you shield her from the social consequences of her betrayal of you?), then you probably need to explain to her bluntly that you found her actions indefensible and by extension you're having trouble defending her. 

She's not the same woman you married in your eyes right now, perhaps ever. She doesn't deserve you to constantly stick up for her because you don't know who you're defending. She needs to learn that you need to get to know this new ""her"":  the cheater, hopefully the genuinely remorseful, the liar and sneak, the woman whose shame is now laid bare for the world to scorn. 

Once you get to know these new facets and decide if their worth characteristics to trust your wife to have and still be your wife, then you should defend her. 

Right Now,  observe how she reacts when it's brought up. Does she attend to you and your needs, whenever someone reminds you of her actions? Does she get angry and humiliated because she doesn't like it being thrown in her face that she what she did was fucking horrible? 

Is her reaction about 'her' or is it about 'us' it's very telling how well reconciliation will go. 

Because if you're holding this much anger, im guessing her reconciliation is pretty weak.

But She won't.
