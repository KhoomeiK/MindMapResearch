You might run into trouble during surgical rotations. At least at my hospital there is no way to cover up your arms between scrubbing and gowning for surgery. The danger is not because of anything the patients could think but because you can **never ever disclose any mental health history!** If you ever need mental health treatment you need to do it away from the hospital and pay cash. That is the sucky way medicine is. If you want to learn more about the reason look into the Physician Health Program. It ruins lives.

Being a mother as a docter needs some support network. And it would be cruel anyways. Put a kid here and when they ask for grandparents, or what they are supposed to do with their life, for any story, I'd have to answer: nothing, just do whatever. No one cares.

I currently only have money for about 2 months saved up. After that I am dead on the street if I can't find a stable way to make money."

SuicideWatch,fozvxnw,t1_foztamk,1588197817.0,"thank you for your answer. 

I know how typical of a thought it is... ironically I became a doctor, finished medschool last year. I thought if I'd just try hard enough, become some sort of amazing surgeon one day someone would love me like I'd be their child. Woke up to that not happening over the past few months. I am still worthless, glorified robot to the attendings, following algorithms 13hrs per day. Completely replaceable. I am miserable and I make my girlfriend miserable. So yeah she'd be better off.
Parents don't know me really, but if they'd know they'd be so ashamed they'd want me dead. They hate ""crazy people"", they made sure I knew how shameful it was when I saw a psychiatrist as a child, first depression round at 11..."
SuicideWatch,fozve3r,t1_fozt01b,1588197540.0,"hey, thanks for your answer and happy cake day...   

They don't know me. My parents don't even know that I am gay. That I am seeing a psychiatrist. They have their precious image of their perfect little doctor daughter. I am playing a role and they've never helped me with anything, their ""daughter"" does not need help, if I would, I would not be their daughter anymore. And I don't want help from them, they are worse than strangers. No emotional connection there... 

I don't have friends other than that. Only my girlfriend who yes would be devastated, but she understands and said she'd pull through.  
That's all. The 3 people at my funeral. 4 if my brother showed up, he also obv does not know me."

You obviously have not experience mental health issues and I hope it stays that way but that you'll make experiences that let you appreciate this without condescension of people not so lucky. And that when you end up needing medical care at a point in your life your doctor will be someone empathetic and kind like that nurse in that post, not a performing cold robot. 

Maybe just this: at no point in time do I let my personal background and pain get in the way of patient care. If I'd notice that I was impaired in any way, be it because of my diagnosis or any other health issue (like a bad headache, you know, like every person can get at any time and could make them have to step away in the OR) I would immediately take the necessary steps to ensure patient safety.   

I swore an oath. Do no harm."
worldnews,fmoqvge,t1_fmoh7ts,1586266519.0,"Thank you so much!

Yep. I live this odd life of being very functional if viewed from the outside, with an intensly stressful job while also being pretty damaged. It is like two seperate lifes and only very few people I know irl know about my background.   

Seeing a psychiatrist is seen as signs of a defect. They don't hire defect robots. Competition in my surgical subspeciality is extreme. I have an attending who is talented, hard working, cares a lot about her patients and objectively beautiful. She does not have a job lined up next year yet cause there are just too many who want in... anything even remotely ""not ideal"" gets you blacklisted. I am also in the closet about being gay for that reason.  

I am sorry that you have to deal with cptsd too. The pain and fear that will just wash over you either randomly or if you got reminded of something is intense and I feel like most people who had normal childhoods have no way of relating to it. One thing that is very difficult for me is when I have a kid as a patient and the parent is all sweet and caring. Because there is a part of my brain desperately wanting to be that kid and having a real family... 

I hope you get all the help you need! Remember that it is ok to take your time, to take care of yourself (I know how hard that can be). You matter! <3"

Those things should be guaranteed and free to every human from the moment they are born to the moment they die. No matter where they are, who their parents are or even what they did or did not do in life.   

I deeply believe that and I will try to fight to bring us a little bit closer to a world where that is the case."
