StrangerThings,fqgqbhj,t1_fqgcy2z,1589353666.0,"""I don't understand! What did I do to deserve this? I did **nothing** wrong!""

Like, I get that teenagers are dumb and moody, I was one not that long ago, but they made Mike *really* dumb and completely lacking in perspective. The whole conflict could have been resolved if he just told El that Hopper threatened him.

But yeah, Hopper... he was even more insufferable. He was such an asshole to not only Mike and El, but Joyce too, and she really doesn't deserve that. It completely ruined the chemistry between the two for me. 

So much of the drama between characters in that season felt incredibly contrived just for drama sake. With everything that everyone's been through, how can any of them have any difficulty believing that some crazy spooky shit's happening again?"
uAlbertaCrush,fq8bmhz,t3_ghdwjn,1589162537.0,"I thought this was silly at first, but it's actually fairly understandable as someone who's been insecure about their race when it came to romantic attraction. 

I'm Asian and have often worried about not being able to date outside of other Asians over the notion that Asian guys aren't perceived to be as attractive. Yet so far, every girlfriend I've had have been of another race.

The truth is that race really isn't that big of a deal most of the time. Race might influence someone's preferences, and that's difficult to avoid, but rarely to the extent that they'll outright rule out one or multiple types of people. 

Basically, just don't make the race thing a big deal. As long as you're not actually driven by some sort of fetishization of their race, you shouldn't have anything to worry about. 

Lastly, if they reject you based solely on your race, then they weren't worth it anyways."
heroesofthestorm,fpwz9bh,t1_fpwvvat,1588972695.0,">and the hero YOU play could quite as easily be their next fuckup

*'Nam flashbacks to Tyrande and Whitemane*"
heroesofthestorm,fpv5gd6,t1_fpuyefq,1588935548.0,">it's clear they didn't have a single big ""cool inspiration"" to build a rework around

That really is a big takeaway from this. 

They actually already had a great concept to build around with her new skin and what they themselves mentioned of the Lightning Javazon--make her into the goddess of lightning. Center her character around chaining, forking, and bouncing attacks... something her old kit was already good at. But they could have built on that even more and have her talents give players the choice of specializing into how they want to chain their attacks--AA, Q, possibly E.

Then they could have still changed her physical armor to general armor and adjusted health and mechanics. They could have even turned her W into an ability that applies static or something to enemies, which empower Cassia's attacks when she hits them.

And boom, no more anti-AA character. Hello chain attack character.

But instead, they eviscerated Charged Strikes and neutered her Q. Now the only half-decent way to play her is E build. And so her identity has instead become a... close-range stabby mage? (Which would actually be a brilliant fit for my in-game name, except I really don't care for Fend build)"
heroesofthestorm,fpuumxy,t3_gfl12j,1588924284.0,"Yeah, I'm not sure what they were going for here with the Cassia rework... I also fell in love with her through her Q build, and I had been having a lot of fun recently with her AA build. But now...

They've completely guttered her base AA and Charged Strikes for .5 extra range, and her new talents don't even come close to making up for it. 

Q now has two charges baseline... *but at what cost?* It got nerfed in just about every other possible way. Its quest got infinite scaling but stacks stupidly slow. Before you needed just 20 hits to get 100 extra damage, now you need *75* hits to get the same amount of damage. I haven't played many games with her yet, but I seriously doubt people will get much more damage than that. 40 hits wasn't a high bar to hit for that extra charge of Q, but now it also has a higher cooldown and is more mana-intensive. Her 16 talents for Q are cool, but like you said, it's awkward to have to choose between them.

30 overall armor is pretty nice, but I don't get why they had to make the ramp up so slow when you can lose it in literally less than a second. She gets even extra super fucked by hard CC now with the massive health nerf.

Before the rework, she was one of the few heroes whose talent tree was in a really good spot in terms of balance (minus level 4), so I found it a really odd choice to rework her. I know they want heroes to be less rock-paper-scissors where they're super strong against certain types of heroes, but they probably could have addressed that with a much less extensive overhaul.

Honestly, it feels like the only thing this rework did was make shitty Cassias--who think they're just supposed to use Fend to do a bunch of damage--less shitty."

It was disappointing to hear TPS actually address the players based on who they are but not have that feature carry over to BL3. I was already frustrated when I played as Maya in BL2 by how her siren status was completely ignored, when said status had such an important role in the story, and to see that be repeated all over again when I played as Amara was incredibly disappointing."
Borderlands,fozmls2,t1_fox8s21,1588193187.0,"Yeah I've been going through the story a bunch of times again as well playing the other VHs, and I've found myself dreading whenever I have to go talk to Lilith on the bridge and stand around pointlessly, waiting for a bunch of dialogue I've heard before to end. 

I can't even run around Sanctuary and manage my VH or whatnot because half the time the game needs you to 'Talk' to one of the characters and press E on them to trigger another sequence of dialogue before actually getting on with the main quest.

Maybe if your VH actually gets some interesting unique dialogue when they, you know, *talk* to Lilith and Tannis it'd make it worth sitting through. But as it is, these interludes completely kill the story's momentum."

Don't forget that, like Angel, Tyreen killed their mother (unclear if accidental) with her powers as well. A foil could maybe be seen in how Typhon wanted to keep the world safe from his kids but ended up dying to them instead, whereas Jack wanted to keep his kid safe from the world (Typhon did as well, initially), but Angel rathered she die than help her father any further or be his prisoner.

As for the comparison to Jack's rise up the corporate ladder, it's notable to point out that Typhon also worked for them at one point, and is how he grew to hate them.

But yes, it's a fairly clear parallel with a lot of wasted potential. 'Wasted potential' is essentially the defining characteristic of the main story with how many interesting threads it sets up but never expand on."

When they play favorites between starters, they're essentially playing favorites *over* the fans of starters who don't get special treatment.

Though to be fair, the games (mainly 2) don't always do a good job of remaining consistent with the comics. e.g. Ivy's awful treatment of Harley, Damian still being an insufferable asshole (he's so much better in the comics and what I'm most disappointed with not having in I2), no indication that Supergirl has already met and been on good terms with Jaime and Damian, just the general lack of Barbara, and a lot of the battle simulator/arcade endings that completely deviate from the events of the comics (though we could dismiss those as not really fitting with canon anyways)."

INJUSTICE,f572m2c,t1_f56mqtn,1572030677.0,"Based on what happened in the comics, they probably would be on Batman's side.

A quick rundown of what happened is that Supes trapped Conner and Cassie in the Phantom Zone with Starfire and Tim Drake (what was left of the Teen Titans, basically) because they didn't agree. Between the two games, Batman and co. busted them out (Tim gets killed by Zod, who was also in the Phantom Zone, long story). The three Titans later end up helping the Green Lanterns fight the Red Lanterns and Starro, but Conner and Cassie are lured away and captured by Braniac, who took a quick look at them and was like *meh* and tossed them back into space to die. Then Booster Gold (but from an earlier time in his life, as his present/future self is working with Bats and the Titans) and the Legion appears and saves them, and that's basically all we get of them (minus present/future Booster, who actually dies saving Jaime).

*takes a deep breath* 

So... unless other members of the Legion want to help Supes for some reason (probably not, since they seemed to have been specifically looking for Conner and Wonder Girl), they would almost definitely be on Batman's side. (it's a mess I know)

What's also interesting was how Superboy was basically taking on the mantle of Superman before all that, having been given one of his old costumes by Clark's parents. So if they do bring in the Legion, they could possibly even go the route of not bringing back Clark for the main story (because come on, how many times is he going to get free) and have Conner be the new Superman instead."
INJUSTICE,f55d9g1,t3_dmtr00,1572005264.0,"In the comics, Superboy and Wonder Girl are saved by the Legion too! That could have been a plot point they introduced and left open for something along these lines.

As for Vandal Savage, I don't actually recall him ever being mentioned, so he could definitely play a future role."

A good KTZ is one of the most terrifying things in the game, and incredibly unfun to play against as you just die if you get hit by one of his chains.

A bad one you can pretty much ignore."
