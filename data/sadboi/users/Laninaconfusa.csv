india,fqzspbd,t1_fqxg31s,1589774469.0,"I think people just wanted to fight. Most teens wait for moments like this to prove that they are gutsy and brave. A lot of it also points to toxic masculinity, like trying to question another guy's sexuality and making fun of those who have alternate sexualities. Even on reddit I have seen various Indian guys being pissed off because they don't understand how women could like and and have crushes on ""gay looking men or feminine guys"". I can't believe I typed that...yuck. Also....Indian ""roasting"" youtube is full of these douchey Alpha males. And if anything wrong happens with them, these stupid teen goats are surely going to bleat mindlessly for them."
