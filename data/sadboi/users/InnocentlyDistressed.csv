DeadBedrooms,fr6nxbe,t1_fr66mpb,1589929775.0,"Everyone has different energy levels though. I’m not like trying to excuse everyone because you should ALWAYS ALWAYS want to make the partner you are with feel good but I know at least for my ex he was so tired after he often passed right out. So I always got off before we did piv because that way I would either cum once and be satisfied with that or cum twice once before and once during sex. 

Not everyone will work the same after sex especially in older men so you’ve got to figure out what will work for you. Certainly demand that you get yours because That’s what you DESERVE. But if your SO honestly has little energy after to put the enthusiasm in then rework it to where you are the first priority."
DeadBedrooms,fr6nfa4,t1_fr5rdua,1589929496.0,"So solution to that, you’ve got to get him to work on you before he gets anything for himself. I find once guys cum they loose all their energy (most guys anyways). You should be cumming first and then him after that way you both are enjoying yourself. 

Might be worth bringing back up he might not have done it again because he thinks he’s bad at it (which tbh he wasn’t great) which I think is more because he had no more energy and drive left. Have felt this frustration before I think maybe you need to bring it up and change when you get off so that he’s got energy to spare."

relationship_advice,fr5ooj1,t3_gmoulm,1589912073.0,"If I was you I would be calling them back and say this is my life and I want a relationship with my bio father. He is a genuinely nice person and I deserve that relationship. If you don’t want to loose me as a child you will start being supportive and stop trying to manipulate me with guilt and rude comments. It is NOT okay to treat me that way. If you want to be in my life you need to start being loving and supportive of my decisions. 

Then I would leave the ball in their court. I don’t think how they are trying to manipulate you is at all okay. I find it abusive and you get to decide who you invite into your life, they don’t get to guilt you into things. 

I get your parents are panicky and very selfish. I understand where they are coming from, most bio parents don’t have to share their kid with other parents unless there is a divorce. They don’t want to share and I don’t think that’s fair to you. At this point you know what you want so you have to make it clear to them. Their behaviour isn’t acceptable."
Needafriend,fr5m1oe,t3_gmkmai,1589910786.0,Lol I’m basically M but I’ve found people tend to walk all over you when you people please like that and are willing to do what they want to do all the time.

Please don’t think everyone with this illness is the same or a burden because they aren’t!

BipolarSOs,fqtfw0i,t1_fqt4a8k,1589638181.0,":) no one thinks you are! Unmedicated people in denial don’t really understand how necessary medication is. It takes a long time for the meds to actually start working but it’s something that needs to be dedicated to for a healthy life. Usually posts like this are only made when the other person is unmedicated or doesn’t have therapy. Honestly so important to have both, I wish more people understood that once diagnosed."
BipolarSOs,fqtepeq,t3_gksgsl,1589637501.0,"These posts make me SO sad. Boundaries are important REGARDLESS of illness. YOU MATTER! Your feelings matter! 

So many people are letting other hurt them for love. You have to be firm on what you need and your partner to be healthy has to make sure that they have the routine, therapy, support system and meds in order to create a healthy lifestyle and mindset. No you should not let him run off with someone that makes you uncomfortable because he’s depressed. 

He needs to go see his therapist if he’s depressed and since he’s not seeing a therapist?? (I think?) he’s not taking care of himself for both of you. Be insistent that he has those things needed to keep up his mental health because you don’t deserve to suffer and be put in pain at the expense of what he thinks he needs."

My moms name is Karen and it’s now been used as a way to say an angry older white lady who feels entitled. My mom is one of the sweetest non confrontational people I know.

relationship_advice,fqmq8gt,t1_fqmdda1,1589481685.0,"Second all this! No one you are dating should be calling you any kind of names to tear you down for any reason mad or not.

unpopularopinion,fqhg5ww,t1_fqh7ajr,1589376299.0,We aren’t allowed to wear shorts from what I understand but literally everything else on the list. Men have to wear pants if it’s crazy hot out and we have the option to dress down with flowy skirts and dresses so of course the temperature is going to be set lower for the people that don’t have clothing options.
BipolarSOs,fqha1ey,t1_fqgou65,1589372222.0,"I just got off this roller coaster myself but I did learn a few things. Without regular medication and therapy it is never going to work out, you can’t make excuses using an illness to justify actions (yes they have an illness but you need to set boundaries and stick to them for your own wellbeing) and you HAVE TO be able to put yourself and your needs first. Yes your man is sick but if you are always putting them above your own needs you will burn out because they cannot do the same back for you. 

You are single right now, please take this time to reflect and really look after yourself. I know how hard that can be when you are not used to it but if he comes back and you get back together you need to be prepared. It doesn’t sound like he’s in a good healthy routine yet so this is likely to happen again and you need to be independent and strong in your own self worth in order to manage it.  

As a side note, having BP is never an excuse to cheat on someone there are ways to avoid those kinds of triggers and actions but I don’t think your bf is in therapy to make full use of that. Don’t set yourself on fire for someone else’s happiness"

dating,fqdmpqh,t3_gi6isc,1589292805.0,Well I’m glad you figured out what you want I guess. Sex is always better with a partner imo but I will say one experience isn’t enough of a basis to say sex isn’t good. Myself personally I don’t sleep around I am a relationship person but even I will say that sex is good I just don’t want it with a stranger.
dogs,fqdltkj,t1_fqdfifn,1589292316.0,"Yes :) I know most foster programs pay for the basics the dog needs or at least the one I was looking into does which is why I want to foster and not adopt. 

Also I am very aware of the cat issue that’s why I’m building some shelving for my cat to get up and well above where any dog can reach in order to have his own space. I was working from home before the pandemic so I’ll be home to monitor everything even after it’s over. The only reason I haven’t fostered yet is because I don’t have those shelves set up and safety things in place for the cat yet. Although I will be here I think he still needs his own off the ground space where he feels secure."
BipolarSOs,fqdkwzt,t3_gi7i0w,1589291811.0,"Honestly cheating crosses a line for me that I wouldn’t go back on for my own mental safety. One that trust is gone I can’t go back but I think if you love him you stop focusing all your energy stressing on whether or not he comes back. The best thing for you to do is mourn your loss, start the healing process and start making a life for yourself. You have been sacrificing a lot for this relationship and I think you use this time to figure out what you need in your life for yourself. 

If he comes back you can deal with if you still want this relationship then and if he doesn’t then you have continued into a life that is supportive for you."

I much prefer to involve my partner then to have fun alone. I will say tho ( like men) sometimes it’s just a stress relief and  it’s easier to sleep after when I’m alone.
sex,fqcgt9q,t1_fqcb3ua,1589257850.0,"Honestly never masterbated much myself when in a relationship but I will say that it took being with someone new after my first ex to realize what exactly I was missing out on sex wise. I thought it was good but it wasn’t as much as I thought. Sex was definitely better with my recent ex and I learned some new things on my own likes and dislikes there as well. 

Glad you are slowly discovering your own pleasures I will say I think my recent ex had a head start because I took a few years off dating between the 2 and learned a lot more about myself and what is enjoyable."

Do you have a friend you could move in with? I think the living situation right now sounds dangerous with him constantly going over your boundaries and attacking you. I don’t like that he wants to talk about the relationship either it sounds a lot like he’s going to attempt to manipulate you back into a relationship and I don’t think that’s healthy for either of you. 

I’d look into trying to move out ASAP. Definitely do NOT get back together. Just be careful because not getting what he wants might cause the situation to escalate. You need out."

Trust me it’s better to loose the dead weight then be anxious you haven’t heard from them in days or cry because you’re being treated like your feelings don’t matter by someone you care about. 

Don’t stay because you don’t want to be alone because being alone actually feels so much better then being mistreated."

dating_advice,fq5w1k4,t1_fq5du17,1589118947.0,Yeah my ex kind of did this but I had never done anything to him so he blamed my reaction to something stupid he did and that since I wasn’t screaming and calling him names this must be amicable and ect. I really just think he felt guilty and wanted anything he could grab onto as an excuse when really he’d just been leading me on saying he loved me and bringing me around all his family.

The good news is I think I learned the same valuable lesson you did. It’s not worth making yourself miserable to love someone that does not seem to care about you the same way. Life is too short and if you have tried to communicate and nothing changes you owe it to yourself to be happy and move on."

That’s just me, hookups wouldn’t work for me because at some point I’d get attached and get hurt because I need that emotional connection too. 

There are lots of people out there that can have sex with women/men because they have the urge to and for them that’s great. I wouldn’t compare yourself or the people you meet to that mentality. You find what works for you and find a girl that’s on a similar wavelength."

socialskills,fpli43z,t3_ge1ut5,1588713115.0,YES! Thank you! I’m so bad with conflict but if I can text out how I’m feeling it’s so much easier to get out exactly how I am feeling. In person I get nervous and forget things that I need to say!

Codependency,fpl0flq,t3_ge2q84,1588704190.0,Yes and no. When my first relationship ended I took 2 years to myself to just be alone and figure things out. When my most recent relationship ended a few weeks ago tho it hit me in a different way. My codependency was trying to emotionally attach to anyone is could even if it was just a friend. I’ve been working on it ... with the pandemic and living alone that feeling of loneliness hits a lot harder. Lol I don’t really have a lot of tips but I have been thinking I need to have some time to myself with all social media turned off so I can just be alone with myself without distractions. Idk if that would help you but I’m finding more and more I’m looking for validation online so it’d be easier if maybe you took some me time for an hour a day too just to be with yourself and reflect on what you really want?
BipolarSOs,fpkq1hd,t1_fpkmkfa,1588699047.0,Agree with this! Don’t let yourself be blamed for a nightmare you expressed to your partner. Being BP doesn’t mean that can’t be loving and understanding.
dating,fpknjua,t1_fpknhcc,1588697819.0,No! Lol I have Apple Music
dating,fpkn1th,t1_fpkh66u,1588697572.0,🤣 I have been distracting myself with reddit mostly. So far though I have had to distract myself until I’m so exhausted that my eyes start to close for me to fall asleep otherwise the thoughts just come for me. It’s a cycle. Hobbies and stuff help during the day night time is another issue lol.
dating,fpkg161,t1_fpjkjm3,1588694020.0,Lol easy to say hard to kick those thoughts out.
relationship_advice,fpkfp2u,t1_fpkdy1e,1588693846.0,That’s horrifying that someone thinks that’s okay to do. It’s worse because someone in this situation might actual need some help and no one is going to believe their story is real.
Codependency,fpk2920,t3_gdxqbq,1588686517.0,I could do with that too maybe
relationship_advice,fpjvan2,t1_fpjl6dz,1588681942.0,Honestly my stomach is in knots now!!! Pleas give us an update and let us know you got out okay!
relationships,fpj0p88,t3_gdep30,1588653420.0,"Hey! As someone who dated a guy for 5 years and have them break up with me due to idk whatever excuse they gave to then go date a yoga instructor ... I will say it took me 2 years of finding myself and doing my own thing in order to move on. I found someone else I cared about and that relationship didn’t turn out either but the point is. There’s not just one person out there for you. The world is fully of amazing people, you being one of them and you will find someone else you care about that will love you for you."
