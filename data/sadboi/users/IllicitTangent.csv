ptsd,fpwzwrq,t1_fpwnlz1,1588973041.0,"I've been thinking about this a lot lately. I think this period we're in now will also cause some wide spread ""generational"" trauma. Our current healthcare system is really only set up to help individuals with trauma and it seems to me that the general consensus is that we're outliers. I've been starting to wonder how we might be able to address the larger generational traumas that you've mentioned, and how if we start to address these issues we could see certain ""norms"" associated with certain groups of people change after starting that healing process collectively. It's an interesting question and I find myself applying it to more and more groups of people and actions that could be considered symptoms if you took the time to question it. 

i.e. certain groups of people with an almost pathological need to have unlimited access to guns. If we took a step back I would be surprised if we couldn't associate this with a larger trauma that went unaddressed for a long time and this behavior was developed as a maladaptive survival mechanism.

It makes so many people so much more relatable and valid and makes me curious about how much more I take for granted in myself that is a response to something I'm not yet aware of. It just makes me more open minded to my own personal suffering too, I think. Gives me more space to just be with it, and allow others to be themselves around me even if I don't agree with what they're up to. (Within reason of course.)"

I'm happy to help if I can. :) It's important not just so they leave you alone but also so that they don't do this sort of thing to others in your situation.

Also you can set your posts to private. All you have to do is go to edit your profile and you should be able to change your post visibility. If they continue to harass you I would say make a new account and set your posts to invisible at the very start. It's ridiculous and we shouldn't have to do this, but here we are. Some people just haven't gotten out of that cycle of abuse and maybe never will.

I can't say anything about social media in general, though I know it gives lots of us in this community anxiety in general. Situations like this certainly don't help.

The second is you are definitely NOT alone and it really does get better. It's not easy, for sure and I don't think anyone here would pretend that it is. But just by practicing recognition, knowing the names of the things that you're experiencing is a great place to be (even if it doesn't feel like it). I've been going through an emotional flashback all week, so I know exactly what you're talking about.

Please remember that you're not a failure. You're going through a really difficult experience. Anyone would be doing exactly what you're doing in your shoes. You have a reason for reacting this way. You're not making it up. Take today to do what the other comment recommended. Get yourself grounded, take care of yourself, remember where you are. Have you eaten yet today? Have you taken a shower? Get outside for a little bit, even just a minute or two if you can. Anything to change up where you're physically at. All these things will help ground you as well as give you more energy to stand in the face of what you're up against.

I love you. You're not alone. You're not a failure."
CPTSD,ffkdh92,t3_ets2vh,1580020970.0,"I have the same problem, to the point that I'll have like real emotional reactions to them as though they were actually happening? Like I've made myself cry just by imagining the worst possible conversation I could possibly have in a given moment.

What I've started to do is recognize when I'm in a fake conversation in my head. Then I'll remind myself that this isn't actually happening. Then I'll ask myself ""why am I having this conversation?"" ""What am I getting out of this that's important to me?"" ""What is my biggest concern in this conversation?"" This way I move the attention away from the theoretical person I'm talking to and toward the part of my brain controlling the conversation. And I don't ask these to invalidate myself but rather to figure out what's actually important to me that I haven't been able to express in a healthy way. A lot of the time it's around a specific concern I have about or for the other person and I can kinda organize that concern in such a way that I don't need to ruminate on it (sometimes only temporarily, but still). 

I'll look at the concern I've found and decide if it's 1) worth my energy and attention (and if not then I actively decide I'm no longer concerned about it) 2) look at the possible actions I can take on it and 3) decide what the most appropriate response is to the situation outside of my imaginings."

Honestly, I feel like ace is one of the most underrepresented LGBT groups, and I personally believe that a ton of people are actually ace/aro and just don't know about it/recognize it because it's so underrepresented. Ace and non-binary are the characters that I get most psyched about I think because I've always been borderline on both.

You have to be careful though and go slowly and listen to your body and what it's telling you. There are some studies that say that prolonged use of marijuana can actually increase anxiety over time, even though it might mitigate short term issues. 

I smoke infrequently, and when I notice I'm staying to do it more regularly I back off for a while, because I've seen a lot of people use it as a crutch and don't move forward in other parts of their life. Some people I think on the subreddit have said that they actually feel much worse while using it and get frustrated when people treat it as a cure-all.

That being said, I've noticed it really helps me deal with anxiety. If I've been feeling wound up all day for no particularly good reason I'll smoke a little bit and do something fun so that I can actually enjoy the fun thing. If I do this a couple times a month it really helps me manage. Also, my boyfriend has had some big personal revelations smoking weed that have changed his life significantly for the better. It's totally a personal thing and it depends on how you react to it. 

If you can figure out how it works for you, it could help. But be gentle with yourself and don't dive in expecting it solve anything. It just lightens the load a little bit when you can't carry everything by yourself. Either way, I feel you friend. I hope this helps."

I'm talking about in person discussions specifically, not even in arguments with people but just normal conversation. For example, I've experienced a lot of situations with some of the men I know where they'll just completely ignore something that I - or another girl in our friend group - said. Like, not even acknowledge that it was said, despite it being in the natural flow of the conversation.

This will happen pretty frequently in our dnd sessions - it's half women, half men - and a lot of the ideas that the female players have will either be flat out ignored, immediately shut down, or just talked over. The reason I say it's specifically about women is because I haven't observed this behavior toward any of the men.

What's been helping me (especially with night time spirals): 

1) start to understand that that bastard hamster is a friggin liar. DOUBT what it's telling you. My own comes out when I'm trying to sleep as well and let me tell you, it is not nice to me.

2) take into account if they've ever actually said whether or not something's a problem. (I think people with our issues tend to overlook this important factor because it requires trusting other people to say what they mean XD) Take a stand for yourself AND the other person by giving them the option of being a good and reasonable human. It's hard, but the people who have made us feel like everyone is against us are actually few and far between.

3) switch the perspectives of the people involved. Give yourself the gift of empathy by switching who did what. If you were her and she did/said things similar to what you have, how would they make you feel? Would it be reasonable to be super upset/break off the relationship. In this case it would be about both of you, I.e. have you done anything that would be a*reasonable* cause to think you weren't good for her. If you broke it off with her, for example, would she be blindsided? What you've said would theoretically already answer these questions, the difference is the perspective you're saying it from. I find this step the hardest because it requires I put aside my anxiety for a moment and treat myself with empathy, but it's ultimately helpful.

4) ask yourself, have you done/said anything someone else wouldn't have? Or is what you're over thinking primarily extra content from that pesky brain of yours? I.e. my thing is I get angry frequently and often out of no where, however when I express that it's normally like, a couple of clipped, quiet words and then I disengage. To me those clipped words feel like screaming, but when I apologise most people don't even know that I was angry in the first place. What I was apologizing for really then was what was happening in my mind, which is a totally different conversation to have, and likely to a therapist and not an innocent bystander XD. I find this one weird because it requires you to talk to other people about their experience of the situation. Since I'm a dramatic ho (the longer things sit in my brain the more worried I get about then), I've found my experience of the world is a little off (or more than a little since I'm in this subreddit XD) and really the only way to correct that is to talk with others to figure out where solid ground is.

5) practice noticing when you start to spiral at night time. It takes me a while, but once I realize I'm not interacting with the person I'm thinking about and all of this is entirely theoretical I can start to shake myself loose and put feelings aside to be dealt with in the morning. Normally by thinking something like ""what's done is done, there are no more actions to be taken tonight. Everything I'm thinking now can wait until tomorrow when I'm ready to do something about it."" It takes a few repetitions sometimes but it helps get rid of that ""do something now!!!"" Feeling, if you have a problem with that. If you find you can't stop the spiral with thoughts, you can also physically disrupt then either by consuming media for a bit (NOT something that might cause you to get excited/amped up) and focusing on that or get up and do something that requires your physical attention for a little while. It's like a hard reset almost.

2-4 are much easier to do with another person, so discussing it with someone next day can be really helpful to prevent a night time spiral on the future. Doesn't have to be this girl but if you really like her, could be a great way to let her know a little bit about you. Don't just dump it all on her, but opening a small window of communication/trust can go a long way to seeing if they are really worthwhile and also if it has any chance for a long term thing. Conversations like these are part of why I started dating my SO.

I assumed a few things in this, since I was coming from my own experiences, but I hope this helps. :) Sorry it was so long. It was a really good question I was answering. Good luck, friend."

ptsd,f2imp5w,t3_dde25x,1570259436.0,"Yeah, I've recently figured out that I get auditory hallucinations and physical touch hallucinations (w/e that's called). When I'm really stressed and am in bed with the lights off I usually feel bugs crawling on me beneath the covers. The only way I can stop it is to either get it from under the covers or have my SO touch my skin so I can remember what real sensations are.

I also have auditory hallucinations of something scratching at the door, which is fairly new but I'm realizing it's an extension of not feeling safe in my home. I used to just be convinced that as soon as I closed my eyes someone was going to open my bedroom door or that they were already there and I just couldn't see them. I think the auditory hallucination is actually a good sign because it means I'm starting to process that shit and I'm actually realizing this feeling is made up, this experience is something my brain is making to make this panic make sense. Otherwise it's inappropriate to feel this way.

Thanks for the ask!! You got me thinkin'."

ptsd,eyyx25p,t3_czgswl,1567604163.0,"Hey fam, just wanted to say I'm going through the same thing right now. I couldn't even close my eyes last night without spiraling out of control, barely got any sleep because of it. I've found that the more research I do and the more I can name my symptoms the worse they feel after cause I can't just go, oh haha it's just one of my weird quirks. Instead I am aware of what's going on and almost trapped in my head, unable to stop anything.

Just wanted to let you know you're not alone, we're all getting through it together.

Also if you're worried about your SO resenting you for talking about it that might be a great conversation to have. I've found it really helpful to like, let my SO know I'm having a rough day and ask if he's open/emotionally available to talk with me and make sure he knows he's not obligated to do so. There are more ways to support someone than listening and tbh our stuff can be really heavy. XD I'm learning that sometimes just letting him know I'm feeling rough and asking for some pets or some alone time can be all that's needed to feel supported from him.

I dunno, I hope something in there hits home for you. Hope you start to see the fruits of your labor soon."
