We were in France last summer for example and we had to go to Italian places most of the time or have something we cooked for the whole time... i mean normally I don’t mind that much but it was just frustrating... also if I’d have eaten something that’s not er least veggie he’d be so fucking judgy...

My First though was that one of our neighbours called the police on my mom again cause she’s growing tomato’s and for some weird realism they allways assume it’s weed? 
They then tell me that apparantly one of the fire alarms went of and one of the neighbours called the fire department! They then had to cram through the small space under de blindes at the veranda door i left open for the cats to go in and out and find that fire alarm and turn it off (it was a false alarm).  Later the two police man showed up to check it out (were late due to a big car accident near us)
Through that short story I had about 5 heart attacks.
I baked the neighbours a cake after the police left to thank them. 
Also the first fireman crawling into the house was welcomed by an angry cat  xD I sadly don’t know who it was or I’d have send them a kitty-shaped apology cake :D"

Right now I’m in a pretty new relationship and he’s so fucking tiny... like without an Ed... and im struggling with the same problem... i never really managed to. Get out of that problem so if you find a salution... tell me pls 😂 it normally gets better after time for me tho... at oke point I tend to relax a bit
