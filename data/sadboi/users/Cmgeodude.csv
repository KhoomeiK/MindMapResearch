ProgrammerHumor,fqonzgq,t3_gjhxqc,1589519926.0,"Semicolons *are* optional according to the Python documentation. You might have to use them if you're including multiple statements on a single line. That's usually discouraged and in practice you would/should never really need to use it, but it might add clarity if you want to modify a variable on the same line where it's initialized.  


Consider a program where the user inputs an integer and mathematical operations are run with that info. If every operation it performs requires the integer to be doubled, it makes sense to reassign its value to twice the inputted number. This might add a little clarity for someone trying to figure out why the input number is always doubled (and is easier to read than trying to type cast and double it in the same statement):  


    some_int = int(input('Enter some integer: ')); some_int *= 2"
learnprogramming,fqcikvz,t3_ghtx45,1589259144.0,"Anecdotal here, but I do a lot of data processing and analysis in my current job. I use Python to gather, organize, and inspect the data. I use it because it's relatively straightforward and gives me more intuitive flexibility with compiling the data into lists than my other language (Java). When dealing with large files and processing them into huge, complex, nested lists and then printing only the pertinent subsections of info to a different file, Python takes its time and you really do notice the tradeoff for ease of programming vs. performance. My scripts usually take a minute or so to process -- not horrible, but would be done in a second in Java. If I'm analyzing more than a few hundred thousand rows, I'll bite the bullet and write the harder program so that I'm not idling for 10 or 15 minutes (and likely freezing/crashing at that point).  


Python does data very, very well. As the operations get more complex, Python is easier and way, way faster to write scripts; however, at the time of execution, if the datasets in question are too large, Python becomes resource-intensive and slow.  As I'm only using a standard laptop as hardware, I sometimes have to choose to use something faster."

learnprogramming,fq53uux,t1_fq4rc6t,1589091670.0,"...Did you just suggest that calculus, trig, and algebra could be learned in 1 or 2 months easily?  


Because I'm pretty sure people spend years learning these subjects normally, and still just under 50% of college students who take calculus (already ambitious students) fail it.  


I'm not saying it can't be learned by the vast, vast majority of people, but it's pretty important to give it lots of time. If you don't, you're not going to learn/retain it. Calculus (and most advanced algebra/trig) is all about analytical skills. You can get those through practice, but give yourself time and don't be frustrated if answers/approaches aren't immediately obvious.  


I just worked on a project that required some intermediate-ish algebra to get the algorithm. The solution itself was quite obvious, but a lot of members of my team simply didn't see it because the approach to get the the solution was not obvious at all (it required solving two sets of three equations in three variables and comparing the results, but that's not really what it looked like on the surface).   


If your math skills aren't great, rest assured that you can improve them. Give them time. Most coding isn't math-intensive, but mathematical logic *is* coding logic (computer science is really a weird branch of applied mathematics at its core), so being a decent mathematician does help. If you want to work in data science/AI/ML, you'll need a pretty good grasp of linear algebra, some calc-based statistics, and finite mathematics. Game designers may need some calculus and analytical trigonometry to make the physics of their games realistic. All coders benefit from understanding discrete math/proofs and the detective skills that allow you to solve equations that  require obscure trigonometric identities, for example. If you're not a (very rare) math genius, don't try to go from intermediate algebra to multivariate calculus in two months. You'd be setting yourself up for disappointment and reinforcing everything you think about yourself ""not being good at math."" (I think you are good at math, you just need more practice and a better grasp of the foundational rules that make things like infinitesimals (im)possible to think about)."

Two people I'm close to had these experiences:  


Person A: didn't commit suicide, but was thinking about it. Talked to her psych who referred her to the hospital. Was put in a nice room in a beautiful ward where she was able to stay for several weeks, attending private and group therapy sessions, adjusting meds, managing side effects, etc, until everything was more or less normal. The hospital billed insurance and left Person A with a $2000 bill.  


Person B: didn't commit suicide, but was ready to. Someone called 911 and he was handcuffed, put in the back of a police car, and dropped off at the hospital. He was yelled at and threatened until he agreed to admit himself. He had a shit room, daily visits with a psych, and group therapy only for three days. He was put on a standard med and told to come back if he was experiencing symptoms. The hospital billed insurance and left Person B with a $3000 bill. The last person he talked to at the hospital was a finance representative who basically passive aggressively threatened to ruin his life if he didn't stick to the payment plan they agreed to.

  
Both insured, both unemployed, but Person A lived in the right neighborhood and got top-of-the-line facilities for as long as she needed them for $1000 less than Person B. Person B lived in the wrong neighborhood, was seen as a likely financial liability, and was asked to leave as soon as he met the medical definition of stable (which basically means he didn't have any means of committing suicide and was frustrated enough to say that it wasn't his plan).

Want to learn Linux? Make a bootable USB with Ubuntu on it and use it as your main OS for a few weeks. If you have an old laptop you're willing to reimage, put CentOS or something on it. Just learn a few basic commands like how to change file permissions, how to make and delete directories, how to create new user accounts, and the like.   


Want to learn programming? There are a ton of great tutorials out there. If you're not trying to be a software engineer, you probably don't need to be able to program a full web app; just learn how to automate some scripts in Python and do some file handling. That might take four or five months of concentrated effort if you give it a couple hours of your time a few times a week. Try [automatetheboringstuff.com](https://automatetheboringstuff.com) to get started. Or, for something a bit more platform-based, you can learn Bash programming on Linux or Powershell on Windows (I recommend the book ""Powershell in a Month of Lunches""). If you want to work on enterprise-scalable programs, r/learnjava has some good resources (particularly the MOOC out of the University of Helsinki). If you're into firmware/operating systems, learn C/C++. If you eventually do want to be a web developer, [freecodecamp.com](https://freecodecamp.com) is at your fingertips, my friend. Taking a week or two to figure out what Git/Github are and how they work *in relatively superficial detail* will be helpful. These things take some time, so there's no better time to start than right now.   


Want to learn security? Cool. There are a lot of different directions you can take within the realm of security. You'll have to have your basics down pretty well, so the traditional entry pathway is by getting the CompTIA trifecta (A+, Net+, Sec+). Check out r/CompTIA for lots of good resources on those certifications. Those will be the foundation: after, you'll need to figure out whether you need to look at getting your CCNA, CEH, CISSP, whatever for the direction you want to go. Those certs will take time (especially the CISSP), but working at the bottom/in the middle for a few years is a great way to understand how security interacts with systems (especially users). It's worth it to say that most security people need to know Linux and Python to do their jobs, so work on those while studying for your A+/Net+/Sec+.  


Two notes:   
1. You'll very likely never feel like you know how to program. There's a lot to it -- much more than anyone can ever learn completely. If you can learn how to do things that pertain to your job, you'll discover that you can learn how to look tasks up and use different tools in your code. I've never met a programmer who doesn't spend 20% of his or her workday looking up answers to problems on StackOverflow -- the trick is understanding those answers enough to determine whether they'd work for your project. Don't feel like you have to be perfect/master every skill you listed. Just be comfortable, confident, and willing to admit when you don't know/need help.  


2. There will be people who help you when you're at the bottom, and people who see you as a threat/incompetent/whatever. The latter group has forgotten that they were once at the bottom. That's ok. Shrug them off and come into work with your head held high. You'll be learning forever, and that's both exciting and expected.  


If you start now and put in the effort, you might find that you have a helpdesk job next year and then a lower-level security or automation or \[fill-in-the-blank\] job in another year or two. There's really no rush to be at the top of the food chain. You've got this!"

Surely that edge is even bigger in less conservative states. (Looking at the poll numbers, if Bloomberg dropped out, that'd be worrisome.)  


I do think that Sanders is going to have to push pretty hard to convince MSNBC and its viewers that he is, in fact, not advocating gulags, and we Bernie supporters are going to have to do whatever we can to stay positive and let the BernieBro(TM) nonsense die out.

1. Make sure you're optimizing your study time. Study in relatively short sessions -- if you overdo it, you can get stuck in the same thinking patterns and never get to the answers -- and focus more on problem-solving than on reading and re-reading. Once you sort of get a concept, move on and come back to it later. Try not to re-read too much at all: you can trick yourself into thinking that you understand the material. This is an illusion of competence that comes from you being more familiar with the text, but not necessarily with the material. Make some flashcards and quiz yourself on them during your breaks at work. This will allow you to 'study' even when your brain is elsewhere, and that's a very good thing (you'll be less likely to get caught in the same neural patterns and more likely to get used to seeing the material at different times of day in different places).
2. Cut yourself some slack. You can always re-take a class if you need to. You have a lot on your plate and that's ok.
3. Make sure you're eating, resting, and exercising enough. Nothing -- not school, not work, not stress-management, not community-life, not family/friends/social-life -- at all will function if you aren't taking care of yourself. If you don't have time for those, you'll have to cut back somewhere. I know that's incredibly hard, but see point #2: you can always take a class next year or after if you have to."
Tucson,fhhj83j,t3_f2g6hu,1581605440.0,"Someone once posted a crime heat map here that showed that there were basically no neighborhoods with noticeably higher instances of crime than others.   


My sister used to live right about there. It's not a nice neighborhood, there are definitely some shady characters, but I think as long as you don't mix up with the wrong people, you'd be fine there. That said, if you can afford to live somewhere more pleasant, do that. The streets of that area aren't dangerous, but they'll sure feel sketchy."
Tucson,fhhispw,t3_f2kj2v,1581605170.0,"Not a native, but I've lived here a long time off-and-on.  


Everyone I was friends with pre-college left post-college. The fact is, this city has a deeply depressed economy (I have a master's degree and pull in <$40k/year. Some of my friends with my same job title make $75k/year in larger cities as close as Phoenix). People are going to larger urban areas with more opportunities.  


Adding to the problem is that my wife and I don't have kids. The people I would potentially like to meet up and hang out with in my age group naturally all seem to want to hang out with other parents. That makes a lot of sense, but it's lonely for those of us who don't have/can't have kids."
Tucson,fhc9w3a,t1_fhc52wc,1581459153.0,"This has been a rumor in these parts for at least 15 years, and I suspect much longer.  


The truth is that some social service agencies participate with Travelers Aid International ([https://www.travelersaid.org/](https://www.travelersaid.org/)), which helps stranded people get to their destinations. Out of desperation, plenty of people in crisis will claim that they are stranded and going to \[pick a warmer climate in winter\]. From the receiving end, it looks like Flagstaff/Portland/Denver/wherever are busing their problem to us. It tends to be more nuanced than that (and in the summer, it goes in the other direction)."
Tucson,fhc9c6h,t1_fhc7s8x,1581458818.0,"I love this response and will only add one thing:   


People experiencing a mental illness are far, far, far more likely to be victims than perpetrators of a crime. If someone is actively having a psychotic break and seems scared, stay calm, lower the tone of your voice, and determine which of the following can best help:  


1. Calling 211 -- connects a person to social services (like shelters) that may be able to help her/him.
2. Calling NAMI at  **(520) 622-6000** or **1 (866) 495-6735** to talk her/him down from a crisis.
3. Calling 911 if and only if the person is a danger to herself/himself or others, and asking for a CIT (Crisis Intervention Trained) officer to come assist."

careerguidance,fgsz5fk,t3_f0a33c,1581095685.0,"> I always hear about people with office jobs just ""deciding"" to go in  late or early some days, how does this work and what's proper etiquette? 

I'm technically scheduled 8-5, but a quick text to my boss means that I've worked 6-3 for a year or so now. Basically, Not much of what I do needs to be coordinated with regular office hours, so as long as I put in my time and get my work done, I'm good. Just make sure everyone on your team knows.  


>Does everyone take lunch at the  similar time? Or can you just eat whenever you want as long as there  isn't a meeting or something scheduled during that time?

My team sometimes has team lunches, but otherwise we just take off whenever we get a second.

>How often and how important are social team events? Are they simply for building camaraderie or do you talk about work?

When my workplace is functional, often and important. They have to do with camaraderie, but also figuring out who is up to what and why x is or isn't getting done. My office manager right now is opposed to them and morale is way down as a result. I don't know most of my coworkers.  


>Do people curse at the office as much as HBO tells me they do?

If they are me, yes. Otherwise, definitely not.  


>What are some interesting traditions at your office that most people wouldn't know existed?

Is having someone systematically file an HR complaint because a fire drill inconvenient a tradition? Office politics?  


>Do you have any tips for spotting a company with toxic workplace culture?

Some phrases to look for in job ads/interviews:

""We like to treat this like a family"" = we expect 1000% of your soul, and we fight and bicker. When you die, your job will be listed before your obit. We won't remember your name 4 weeks later.  


""Work hard, play hard"" = we expect 1000% of your soul, and then we'll shame you for not being collegial when you don't want to go out with us after work.  


""Our HR is here to serve you""  at an interview = HR is 100% in management's corner, and there have been enough incidents that they know so.  


""We want a rockstar"" = Talent-focused. As soon as you screw up, you'll get made to feel like the scum of the earth. You're looking for something more like, ""Safe to make mistakes"" and ""We want to help foster our employees' growth""   


  
Office work can have lots of benefits, but sometimes the trade for it is your soul, so please take care of yourself."
