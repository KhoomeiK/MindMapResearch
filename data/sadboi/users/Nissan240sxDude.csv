AskReddit,flfrpxm,t3_fokp38,1585115394.0,"Slavery from 1619 until about 1865. The way it shaped the world and laws of early America both north, south, and island territory I think it’s not analyzed enough in schools. Also the way the plantations operated like labor camps to black people. It certainly wasn’t a home by any means. Also the way politics are discussed in reference to slavery or about slavery law. That’s upwards of 4 million lives making up roughly a quarter of the United States at one point. It’s amazing how the timeline of the US doesn’t include the labors and achievements by slaves simply because they were slaves. Those souls did a lot of stuff and they deserve recognition for it, especially for the cost of their suffering."
AskReddit,flfreor,t1_flfr4mz,1585115085.0,"Eh, I mean we were taught that it happened but that’s about it. Same with American slavery - until I took an in depth college course on the topic I didn’t know much of the timeline or details. It’s amazing how much slavery played a role in the development of early law and design of the US. I’m sure even though it spanned less time the internment camps had a significant affect on Asian Americans and I think it’s fair to say it deserves more recognition and depth in American history books."

AskReddit,fj91fhb,t3_fc7hed,1583128623.0,"Most toxic job I ever had was this past summer. Working as a lot attendant at a dealership, and I hated every minute of it. I picked a date in my head that allowed me enough time to make the money I wanted to have and allowed me enough time before school picked up again to go on a trip I wanted to go on, and decided I’d put my two weeks in on that day knowing I’d likely get fired on the spot. I really really wanted to quit earlier, and I came very close on a few occasions when I’d get shoveled shit I didn’t earn and was disrespected by my higher ups. I bit my tongue because I could really use the cash for my trip and held onto the date i’d picked. When the day rolled around I mentioned in passing to my bosses I’d be traveling out of town for five days that coming weekend, and I’d have to leave for school two weeks later. I figured they’d let me travel, id work a week, and then go back to school OR they wouldn’t let me travel (I already had tickets purchased and rooms booked) and they’d expect me to stay until school began and fire me then. They called me into the office and thanked me for my effort that summer, shook my hand, and asked me to leave early for the day. I made a quick round to say goodbye to the few people I managed to find a friend in at the dealership and hopped in my car with a smile and a full tank of gas and I drove home to pack for my trip. 

I hated my job there and I regret nothing about any of it. I was not the best employee, and they were not the best management. I’ll never go back. I’m now making nearly twice the pay at my first real job as I finish up college and I’m happy to have had the experience, and I pity those who must endure it after me.

Tldr: pick a date, stick with it, make it logical for finances and other important reasons, be respectful, quit when you’re ready."
