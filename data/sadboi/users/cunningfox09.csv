PanicAttack,fql3f9c,t3_gjf142,1589444882.0,Yeah I do too. I seem to get stuck in my head and then I will panic and cry after which I will feel better. It isnâ€™t a very pleasant experience. It does feel like Iâ€™m walking around in a dream.
Anxiety,fmnj26m,t3_fw5q9i,1586227204.0,Yeah I get really tired after after one. Itâ€™s like I am slightly drunk. I had panic attacks all weekend over the stupidest thing and afterwards I felt like I had run a marathon. It can be really tiring living with an anxiety disorder.
Anxiety,fmjgmqs,t3_fvcocr,1586129926.0,Thank you. I really needed to hear this
aww,fmhgk9v,t3_fv6yj6,1586079237.0,Thatâ€™s one of the cutest things Iâ€™ve seen
DecidingToBeBetter,fhu4b9e,t3_f4oei4,1581881833.0,"I know how you feel. It is definitely a big thing to get over. I have social anxiety and it also applies to online too. Iâ€™ve been trying to be more active online for a year now. I still feel pretty anxious sometimes but nothing compared to when I first started. Iâ€™ve definitely kept some friendships with people in that time that in the past would have just stopped completely. Now Iâ€™m worried I communicate too much lol ðŸ˜‚

Your efforts definitely count! Itâ€™s the only way to stop anxiety controlling your life. I hope you remember how happy you feel in this moment. I try to remember that feeling after doing anything that makes me anxious. I can honestly say that Iâ€™m happier now than when I let my anxiety control my life. Life is much better when you interact with people ðŸ˜Š"
Anxiety,fgezna7,t3_exx6jc,1580716730.0,"Yeah Iâ€™ve noticed that my hearing gets really sensitive when Iâ€™m anxious too. Whenever Iâ€™m in a really anxious mindset I think that all my senses are heightened. It makes sense when you think about it. If something dangerous was chasing you, it would increase your chances of survival to overreact to any small sound. I try to remind myself of this whenever I am in a panicked state. If possible I usually find a quiet space and tell myself that it is only my body trying to protect me and that there is nothing dangerous around me."
Anxiety,fdh5x71,t3_elbs5c,1578416071.0,I love my cats. They have also stopped a lot of my anxiety attacks and have always been there through tough times.
Anxiety,fcpqnjx,t3_eiafhw,1577870036.0,"I feel this way too. I'm glad I'm not alone feeling like this at this time of year. 

I'm not sure why I feel more anxious around this time of year. It could be that there is so much happening around this time that I am just becoming overwhelmed. I am a highly sensitive person and I tend to absorb the feelings around me. I'm not sure if you experience the same thing but I'm thinking that the reason my emotions are all over the place is because there is so much happening around me in a short amount of time."
Asexual,fcmnz8c,t3_ehwokr,1577783629.0,"My friend told me that I might be asexual. I told her that I was scared of meeting this girl the next day and she told me not to expect anything. I said I never do and that I would rather that we were just friends. 

I also like the idea of being in a relationship. I like all the romantic stuff like buying gifts, going on dates, cuddling, holding hands, etc but I don't like the idea of kissing or having sex. It just seems really disgusting to me. I'm essentially looking for a really close friendship. 

I also don't get how people can have one night stands or jump straight into relationships. I'm always happy when someone says they are in a relationship because then I can be friends with them. I never understood why people hated being in the friend zone. I always feel happiest there. For me having close friends was always enough.

There's also things like never having a sex dream and being oblivious to things that suggest sex. I always thought that Netflix and chill meant watching Netflix and relaxing together. It took me years to realise it meant you wanted more than that."
Anxiety,fc4y6f4,t3_eg62xd,1577433544.0,Yeah I always feel like that. I even feel like that around my friend who has anxiety as well and she is the person who probably understands the most.
Anxiety,fbtth46,t3_eec4mk,1577094965.0,"Yeah I feel the same. I know it is totally irrational but I can't stop myself. I think I have an overactive imagination. Even after every time I challenge those thoughts my anxiety always produces a counter thought. It is so annoying! 

I'm so glad that I'm not the only one who experiences this. It is a hard one to talk to people with because they will either laugh or think you are going crazy. One of my fears is losing friends because of it so I would never tell them. I also wouldn't want to make them feel bad as most of the time they are just really busy."
Anxiety,fbdx6sd,t3_eco8ug,1576773343.0,Yeah I'm the same. I think it is because I have too much time to think. I notice this during the day to if I'm not doing something that engages my brain.
Anxiety,fb8rdbp,t3_ebvl46,1576620074.0,Yes I am like this a lot. I hate it!!! Like you I know rationally that the person is most likely focused on what they are doing but I can't help but think I've done something to annoy them. It is definitely worse for me when it isn't face to face. If someone takes a long time to reply to a message I always think they are mad at me.  I try to challenge it with something that is more realistic but I always come back to something I think I've done to annoy them.
socialanxiety,fao1a4c,t3_ea2qy0,1576255256.0,"Well done!!  I'm happy for you ðŸ™‚ I used to feel the same. It was really scary sending messages but like you I actually had a satisfying conversation with someone. I also think I developed stronger friendships because I was able to express some thoughts that I was too anxious to in person. 

It may feel like a small step but every time you challenge your anxiety it gets slightly weaker.  Every step is still a step forward, no matter how small. I wish you luck for the future and I hope you continue to challenge your anxiety."
Anxiety,fa0xgsx,t3_e7eki7,1575761689.0,Well done :) I know what it feels like to have phone anxiety. I still feel awkward on the phone but it is nowhere as bad as it used to be.
Anxiety,f9pomm8,t3_e6blo2,1575544603.0,Well done :) I hope you have fun together. It is always fun making new friends especially after a long time :)
Anxiety,f99fxpv,t3_e45wza,1575190730.0,"I feel like that sometimes too. I often get told that I'm doing something wrong or that I'm too slow. I hate it when I shut down when I'm being yelled at, especially by people that are part of my family. I end up feeling like I need to cry after it has happened. 

I think that if you have completed that task then you haven't really done something in the wrong way. You have just done it in a different way from them. A healthy person would have an open mind to the way you've done something or would say the way they do it. They would actually be happy for you if you've found a new way of doing something and they wouldn't expect you to adopt their way if what you're doing works for you. They certainly wouldn't yell at you for being slow or doing something wrong."
Anxiety,f8dqx7f,t3_e0fhsz,1574505900.0,"I'm happy for you :) It takes a lot of courage to fight your anxiety, especially the first time doing something. I know that feeling all too well in the moments before doing something that makes me anxious. It isn't pleasant. 

You are definitely heading in the right direction by challenging your anxiety. It is the best way to find out that your anxiety has no idea what the outcome will truly be. I've found out it is never as bad as what I thought it would be and that it is actually enjoyable most of the time."
socialskills,f7dvzo0,t3_dvf52y,1573632747.0,"Yeah it isn't the best way to live your life. I eventually found out that if you always try to please people and never speak your mind, you won't really have any true friends. One day I decided to just be my real self and just say what I was thinking. I did lose a lot of friends but I can honestly say I am happier now. I am much happier around the friends I did keep because I can be myself with them without a fear of being judged."
Anxiety,f71i7y4,t3_dtygyl,1573342066.0,"I have felt like occasionally. It is like I am walking around in a dream, it is extremely unpleasant. Sometimes I think it might be something I've ate but often I think it is probably anxiety due to how long it happens. It often ends in me having a panic attack. The longer it happens the worse the panic attack is. I'm actually surprised how well I function in these states. It's like I am on autopilot."
Anxiety,f6z7b1x,t1_f6yvd99,1573311135.0,I know what you mean. I would have multiple tabs open that were just timetables and maps. I was like that when I stayed with friends too. It was nice to just hang out with them in the flat and not have the stress of trying to find where they lived. You would usually have someone to go with you to places as well. That helped reduce my anxiety a lot.
HealthAnxiety,f6yvih8,t3_dtp0d9,1573299889.0,"I also did this to myself. I had a twitch in my leg years ago and I was convinced I was going to die in three years. I now know it was anxiety but back then I jumped to the worst case scenario after googling it.

I have actually banned myself from googling symptoms now. If I'm that worried about it I will now ask a friend or just go to a doctor."
Anxiety,f6yv2u7,t3_dtqvug,1573299195.0,"Yeah I don't understand how people can just easily get up and do stuff either. I always start to panic a little whenever I have to plan journeys. I have to check timetables multiple times just so I know I won't be late arriving anywhere. If anyone saw me doing this I would probably look like a mess. 
I also used to have a panic attack every time I would leave to meet up with friends. It happened so much I think I subconsciously added on time for them because I always arrived on time. It has gotten better over time but I still have a little anxiety before I leave my house."
GetMotivated,f6wiraz,t3_dte1mq,1573227538.0,Haha yeah that's so true. I have to remind myself of this every time I put something off. Even the small things tend to snowball it something bigger in the future if they are not handled today.
socialanxiety,f6wd5m9,t3_dt574b,1573223636.0,"I know exactly how this feels. I think I have experienced it so much I can almost predict when it happens. I just want to run out of the room as soon as the word groups is mentioned, especially if I don't know anyone.
Another one where my anxiety kicks in is when we are told to arrange ourselves in a circle. My stomach just sinks because I know I am going to have to introduce myself to the whole group."
cats,f6twyr2,t3_dsxxfr,1573155174.0,"Haha yeah I know that look. My cat has done this to me many times, especially when I'm about to eat."
socialskills,f6ojg5v,t1_f6nntoo,1573020146.0,Thank you for saying that. I think I just overanalyse too much. I have to remind myself that I feel better sharing than staying quiet.  It is more fun and I definitely feel less alone in the way I think. My anxiety thinks it's protecting me but in reality it is holding me back. I can see this the more I interact with the world.
socialskills,f6nmoz4,t1_f6nk4nc,1572994940.0,"Thank you ðŸ™‚

I think I know what you mean. I think it is partly both for me. I am afraid of what people will say but I have only started to realise I might be a bit of a perfectionist. I sometimes won't say anything because I'm not sure if it sounds right and I will read things over and over again until I feel it is okay to send."
socialskills,f6ncji4,t1_f6msuez,1572988720.0,Yeah I do the same thing too. I always have what I want to say in my head but never have the confidence to post it. It is like the post button is made of fire or something. I think for me it is a fear of being judged too and that someone will say that I am being stupid. I'm starting to realise it is more fun taking part in conversations and that it is rarely as bad as my anxiety makes it out to be. (Congratulations on your first comment. I also rearranged and overthought this comment also. I think with time we will eventually get to a point where we're comfortable sharing opinions.)
socialskills,f6lmrss,t3_drwytw,1572953376.0,I do the same thing as well. I only recently started commenting on stuff. One day I just got bored of my anxiety telling me what to do and decided to fight it. I even rearranged this comment a bit.
aww,f6hn3y8,t3_dr7vmx,1572856744.0,That's so cute. My cat just meows loudly at me when he wants petted.
AskReddit,f6bb899,t3_dqv3tg,1572771324.0,I really enjoy listening to what people have to say. Everyone has their own unique story and viewpoint on life. Plus I feel extremely uncomfortable when the spotlight is on me. This is probably why my closest friends always seem to talk a lot.
GetMotivated,f671exb,t3_dqfz7h,1572715679.0,I agree. You only really see a glimpse into other people's life's. You never know what that person has to go through to even be outside. Even a small step is a step forward on your journey.
Asexual,f63xrmt,t3_dq7t73,1572685109.0,Yeah I find them really uncomfortable to watch. I usually end up looking at my phone until it is over.
aww,f60dlaj,t3_dpy04s,1572614363.0,She is such a cute cat. I hope she got lots of treats
Anxiety,f5wz1cw,t3_dpl8t6,1572532861.0,Yeah I feel exhausted too after a panic attack. I just feel really tired and sad. I feel like I just need to cuddle with someone.
Anxiety,f5w03g0,t3_dpg1sz,1572509045.0,This happens to me as well. It is worse if I have to do something that day but it is usually there on days where I can sleep in too.
gifs,f5vzd0s,t3_dpc5hh,1572507852.0,That's so cute. It's cool that even big kitties enjoy cuddles.
Anxiety,f5sb5ah,t3_doz3zc,1572420486.0,Yeah this is how I experience my anxiety as well. It will sometimes turn into a panic attack but most of the time it is just there. I like to think of it as an annoying parrot that wants attention.
GetMotivated,f5p3rp2,t3_doite0,1572347424.0,That's a good way to think of life. Sometimes I forget that bad times rarely last forever. Something good could just be around the corner.
interestingasfuck,f5p2ers,t3_dokzzw,1572345669.0,I actually thought it was a swimming pool at first. I wish every city was this clean
oddlysatisfying,f5k0xly,t3_do1wpv,1572250947.0,That is so cool. I could watch that all day.
