Effexor,fddomfg,t3_ekthig,1578319695.0,"I have been on 300 mg and felt similar to what you’re describing. I was so tired all the time and felt sluggish, like I was awake but in a dream. I tapered down slowly to 225 but I still get that feeling sometimes. My new Doc says it’s max dose anyone should be taking (300 mg) but I’ve been taking it for over 15 years. 

I wish you luck in lowering your dose. I did 37.5 per month and had minimal side effects."
Effexor,fcj5gla,t3_ehgc9n,1577677741.0,Have you been taking it at the same time everyday?
Connecticut,f9etah7,t1_f9e8dt3,1575251007.0,Thank you. I’ll check that out.

Effexor,f6y3kna,t3_dton8t,1573266612.0,"I was 225 Effexor and 40mg Vyvanse. I felt great during the day too but by late afternoon I’d be so sick. Nauseated, headache and just overall crappy. I ended up drinking 3 gallons of water a day in order to keep the nausea and headache away. I recently switched to adderall and it’s so much better. You may want to see if the side effects your experiencing subside before you switch but I’d talk to your doc for sure"

Effexor,f58vpff,t3_dn4zx8,1572065224.0,It’s okay! Glad you called when you know you needed to.
Effexor,f47156p,t3_djpkzt,1571416104.0,"Yes, I have gone up and down several times over the 15 years I’ve been taking it. I have been okay tapering at 37.5 at a time. I do 37.5 a month at a time until I’m at the dose my Doc thinks is best. I’m so sorry you’re dealing with this. It’s a very hard drug to get off."
Effexor,f1es371,t1_f1en4fv,1569429025.0,"I’ve been taking it for 15 years, all different strengths. I have bad days of course but it sounds like perhaps it’s not the right med for you. I would get in touch with a psychiatrist right away. Good luck and I’m
So very sorry you’re feeling this way."

Effexor,eyapg9f,t3_cwfrfb,1566966989.0,"I’ve also been on Effexor a long time (17 years) and currently at 225, my highest being 300. I’ve tapered several times and find the easiest 37.5 two weeks at a time. When did you go back to regular dose? I feel like it sometimes takes a while to regulate. Although, I was having brain fog and forgetting stuff a lot, so my doc put me on adderall that helps tremendously.  I’m sorry you’re going through this"
adderall,ey5lem4,t1_ey4yxpt,1566834510.0,Do you deal with a heavy crash with the vyvanse? I switched to adderall because by 5 on vyvanse I was so sick I couldn’t function.
adderall,ey5l50u,t1_ey4ix7d,1566834328.0,I put some pink Himalayan rock salt in my water and that helps. Can’t taste it
Effexor,extiu80,t3_cu8kws,1566569610.0,"Yes, I have this too. I have been taking Effexor for 15 years and gained a considerable amount on it. The only thing that has worked for me is intermittent fasting. I give myself an 8 hour window to eat which helps. It took my body a few weeks to get used to it but I've managed to lose 40 lbs this year and am back to my pre-effexor weight. I have tried so many things but this is what has helped me the most. Good luck"
Anxiety,ewip0ui,t3_cohwjf,1565453887.0,Valerian root might help to get you to sleep. Intrusive thoughts are so debilitating.

Effexor,evsujcv,t1_erqz47m,1564756486.0,"No Complications, my kids are beautiful and healthy. I was really worried about the post partum depression and I think the effexor really helped with that. I breastfed  both my babes until 18 months. See what your doc says, your mental health is so important especially when your pregnant."
Effexor,evsu4rr,t1_evn0cdf,1564756233.0,"If you are able to taper 37.5 or 75 a month, I would talk to your doc about that. I've been taking Effexor for 13 years and have gone up and down several times. The 37.5 each month taper worked best for me, no withdrawl and no brain zaps. Good luck to you!"
Effexor,evmxky3,t3_ckdgs2,1564615133.0,"I wouldn’t suggest going off cold turkey. Are you supplementing with another med? When I taper down, I do it 37.5 at a time. I’ll taper 37.5 a month until I’m where my doc wants me to be."
Effexor,eu28grj,t3_cefrq2,1563384597.0,He wants you off completely? Is it not working for you anymore? I’ve tapered from 275 down to 225 but never off completely. The lesser dose actually worked better for me.

Effexor,erqyf44,t3_c3h4l4,1561155260.0,"You should taper slowly. It is a hell of a drug to stop slowly, let alone cold turkey. I would take it today and then talk to a compound pharmacy about a taper schedule. Or call your doc"
Effexor,eonpfoh,t3_bscbdd,1558718289.0,"I was put on Effexor xr with klonopin. The klonopin helped me get by until the Effexor started working. I’ve been taking it for about 15 years and it is a godsend for me. I’ve also noticed that if my vitamin D, iron or B12/6 gets low, my anxiety gets much worse. Try and hang in there and hopefully it will help you. Good luck!"
