depression,fa95kb2,t3_e7s6bs,1575863011.0,Omg I feel the exact same way. And for me it’s come to the point of me being a different kind of fake for specific groups of people (idk if that made sense)

depression,f8xf7ko,t3_e2sd78,1574916913.0,"I get it. I’m depressed too and no one in my life cares either. My family has seen the signs that I am and have done nothing. So I thought that they were just THAT oblivious to the people around them, so I told them straight up that “I’m depressed” and “I’m suicidal” and they pretty much laughed it off and told me to get over myself. They see depression as a “new trend” among teens and young adults these days. In the last few weeks I found someone who semi understands what I’m going through and it feels kind of nice, but they mainly talk abt their problems. Which is completely fine bc I always try to be that person for ppl to talk to but at the same time I want someone that I can talk to too. I think they would be fine with it but I always feel like a burden to people when I tell them how I feel. 

I’ve clearly lost the point of why I was writing this.

My point is, I understand what you’re going through (even abt the suppressed memory and the therapist) and there ARE people out there who understand. You’re not alone, no matter how much you keep telling yourself that you are - trust me, ik what it’s like."
depression,f8xdz3f,t3_e2simr,1574915820.0,I know what you mean. There are times where something similar to that has happened to me. There have also been times where my mom or sister would ask me if I remember a certain moment that should probably be extremely vivid in my memories but I just don’t (like when I found out my parents were getting a divorce). It’s weird and interesting at the same time that our brains can just repress a memory that causes us immense pain and hurt
depression,f8wv39k,t3_e2gnrw,1574900730.0,"I feel the same way but at the same time I feel like I don’t deserve to sleep - like at all. 
Idk if that made sense but I see sleeping, eating and ‘basic human needs’ as things I don’t deserve bc I feel like don’t deserve to live."
depression,f8um5o7,t1_f8ufamz,1574834227.0,"I’m the exact same way. I’m just scared to leave behind my family (the ones that actually care about me) and the one or two friends that have actually stood by me. I think of suicide as someone just passing on their pain to someone else - it doesn’t just go away after they die. I don’t want anyone I love to have/feel the emotional pain I feel every day, which is why I haven’t done it yet."
