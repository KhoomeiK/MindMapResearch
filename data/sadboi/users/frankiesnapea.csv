There is no way I would have acted like that on a plane or anywhere in public as a small child. My mom had a look that i knew if I didnt adjust my behavior there was a spanking in my close future.

I keep considering giving it a shot, but my players like to bail last minute and I get really frustrated with the time I take planning the game to have no one commit to coming on time or even showing at all.   I think I would lose my shit if I spent time on the campaign and time to make such beautiful terrain to have people not even show. :( 

Maybe I just need to do it for my own enjoyment and if no one shows I can display epic battles of minis."
BipolarReddit,f5a0dya,t1_f57tzbj,1572098278.0,I have read to that even holding an icecube can have the same effect. Essentially you are trying to ground yourself again. So by focusing on your other senses it can bring you back a bit from the brink. Going outside helps me sometimes because of a breeze. Usually something cold catches my attention better than other things.

Sorry if this is a super dumb question."

dndnext,f3lg0ly,t1_f3i0sm6,1570975518.0,"My favorite games are the ones where either adults or the kids we have in our group do anything out of the box of ""normal"" actions. I love playing with the kids in our group because they are not as strategic yet. It isn't about ""winning"" the game. It is about exploration and infinite possibilities. So they will run full on into rooms full of badies and it is great to see how things play out."
Christianity,f0duhjw,t1_f0djdzh,1568558758.0,"I was a client services director at a Pregnancy Care center. We ABSOLUTELY did not mislead or push an agenda. In fact if the woman decided for an abortion we would give them a check list to go thru to make sure to check that their doctor was a legit doctor and couseled them to find a support person that could care for them after the procedure. 
After an abortion they could always come back for any help if they had any after effects: physically, emotionally, or spiritually. 
Now that being said there are MANY preg care centers that are not ethical so they do mislead others. I worked hard to combat this in our center. 
So long story short, not all centers are bad but you have the be educated and willing to walk out if you are feeling pressured or if every choice is not offered in a equal educated/fact based manner."

Each one of them know I am bipolar and that depression will come sometimes. I have very low maintenance friends that are ok with periods or low to no contact from me.

Perhaps not having the stress of having to appear on top of things all the time will help you to not start disliking them because you dont have to protect yourself. That is just my experience tho."
