Prior to diagnosis I had some experimentation with LSD and shrooms and another experimental psychedelic. I would absolutely never do LSD or experimental psychedelics ever again unless it was a 100% regulated FDA and NHA approved. 

TLDR// stay away from chemically engineered drugs unless it’s monitored. Shrooms are the best, but only under circumstances would I go about use again."

It was getting way worse ! I really wish I could be myself without meds, but myself without it is slightly glorified and I remember how the ups were paired with the downs and how much of an affect it had on the people around me (hence why your mom is trying to convince you). Also my mom was I medicated for a looong time and it had a huge impact on the family life. It wasn’t until after she was medicated and feeling way better that she realized her fault, she should’ve started way earlier.
