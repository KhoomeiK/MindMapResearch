badwomensanatomy,fnxkqug,t1_fnxexpg,1587340673.0,"Wearing a bra obscures the nipple, which is generally considered to be graphic. If your nipples randomly get hard while you’re wearing a bra, it’s no big deal, the cup squishes it down so you can’t tell it’s poking up. But if they get hard when you aren’t wearing a bra, you can see them through the shirt, which makes people uncomfortable, so they judge you. It’s a little bit like seeing a guy’s pants tent in public.

Also, bras make the breasts a different shape under the shirt. It’s pretty easy to tell who’s wearing a bra and who’s not. The fabric just stretches and falls around the breast differently. Going braless invites negative attention from all different types of people.

I go braless most of the time but I can get away with it since I don’t have a big chest. If my boobs were any bigger, I’d probably get dirty looks in public. I wish female breasts weren’t seen as dirty, because if they weren’t, bras wouldn’t be a controversial issue at all."

Double points when they share their insight with those of us whose entire lives are controlled by adhd, and give us generic advice that doesn’t work for us, and the problem of us feeling like we aren’t trying hard enough is just exacerbated.

Medication is supposed to make you feel normal, not strengthen abilities you already had.

My mom recently started adderall because she told her doctor she has trouble focusing sometimes, and now she‘s always disappointed in me.

Everyone experiences day-to-day situational anxiety, sure, but inexplicable, CONSTANT anxiety is horrible, exhausting, and absolutely crippling. Eventually you just run out of energy and you can’t fight the anxious thoughts anymore, so they overtake you and trap you inside your own body. I wouldn’t wish that upon anyone.

You’re basically saying “it’s all in your head”. That’s what clinical anxiety is! It’s your own mind torturing itself! The brain is an organ that’s just as capable of malfunctioning as any other. It’s a monumental struggle just to get out of bed every morning despite feeling like you’re going to panic for no reason whatsoever.

Believe me, we’re constantly ruminating about our anxiety, constantly trying to figure out the root of our problems. Not being able to control your anxiety is terrifying. “Getting over it” is SO MUCH HARDER than it seems.

BoJackHorseman,f2dg9m9,t1_f2ddwkt,1570153417.0,"Thanks! I spent fifteen minutes making sure it was perfectly coherent lol.

I don’t remember exactly what my psychologist said. It was a while ago, so I could be mistaken.

- Both are extremely detail-oriented to the point of it being an obsession—the difference here lies in the fact that ASD individuals have an intense interest in only one or two subjects, and OCPDers try to constantly juggle several obsessions at once until we lose interest.

- Neither are great at interacting with people. Those with milder OCPD tend to be able to act normal in public, but some of us are total outcasts because we just don’t understand what drives everyone else.

- Neither pick up on social cues very well. Before getting treatment, I thought that everyone around me was as just as frustrated and judgmental as I was, because I didn’t understand that different circumstances elicit various emotional reactions.

- Both show little emotion. I almost never tell people how I feel because it just doesn’t come naturally to me.

- Both dislike change and follow a rigid daily routine.

- Both tend to feature anxiety. OCPD is driven by anxiety itself, but I’m not totally sure where anxiety factors into Asperger’s."
BoJackHorseman,f2dcqa4,t1_f2dbm9m,1570150817.0,"That’s interesting. I never really thought of it that way, but I can definitely see where you’re coming from.

I always saw it as OCPD (which I have). Now that I think about it though, I had a psychologist say that OCPD and Asperger’s in particular share a good amount of symptoms, so I guess I was just ascribing aspects of my personality to him without considering that he‘s missing some its key traits."
BoJackHorseman,f2d8nlf,t1_f2d4bdm,1570148521.0,"I can see how he’d be hard to figure out. He has a lot of contradictory traits and no background, but I guess I’m so empathetic to him because I relate to him in a lot of ways, so I’ll try to explain what I think of his character. This will probably be long.

He’s a workaholic to the point that he neglects his appearance. I get the feeling he doesn’t quite understand how to look “normal”, which is painfully relatable to me.

He’s overly formal in his mannerisms. He can’t pick up on social cues, so he overcompensates by acting super polite. He’s very restrained because showing emotion is putting yourself in a vulnerable position, and he’s afraid of making mistakes or being hurt. As a result of this, people around him have a hard time connecting with him, so he doesn’t really have any friends.

I believe he went over PC’s head with Vigor because he wanted to maintain some semblance of control. I have a really hard time trusting people to take care of their own affairs, but I want them to be safe and happy, so I make misguided attempts to keep them out of harm’s way. Judah had good intentions, which is why he said he was trying to protect her, but PC perceived his actions as deceitful and self-serving. Though Judah doesn’t give off many signs, he was confused and hurt by her reaction because he thought she would appreciate his efforts.

At face value he may seem like a dimensionless sociopath, but internally he’s very sensitive to what people think of him. He wants to be perfect because in his mind, there’s nothing to hate about a perfect person.

In the scene where PC signs his personalized cards, Judah’s says “Dear Judah, you are a wonderful employee. I am very proud of you.” By writing this, he’s clearly expressing emotion and a desire to be loved for who he is, but he doesn’t know how to say it in any other way.

Edit - I think he describes his work experience as “very pleasurable” because he derives satisfaction from working and striving for perfection above all else."

As a result, it was noticed and treated first. Back then, I suspected that ADHD was the cause of all my interpersonal problems, but as treatment progressed, my personality remained largely unchanged.

Being told I had OCPD flipped my world upside down. I‘d deluded myself into believing I was the complete opposite of that, so I fought the diagnosis until my psychologist said that that‘s usually what people with OCPD do.
