The statement that non-ionizing radiation cannot cause cancer because it does not have enough energy to break chemical bonds is based on a flawed assumption that doesn’t take into consideration the complexity of biological systems. Ionizing radiation, like chemical oxidizing agents, can create free radicals, which are known to be carcinogenic. What seems to be a conundrum is that exposure to non-ionizing radiation also leads to an increase in free radicals. This conundrum can be resolved if we examine the production of free radicals in living systems. You think back in the 90's all the talk about phone use leading to cancer was all just a lotta hoopla? Even so, the subject isn't researched enough to just take blind a head-dive into.

(I copied a comment translating the first half of the song):

“The South glows, we're bros and hoes
We shine with heat, and dripping with sweat
And I dribble my ball at Långholm Beach, then we go home and jam with our team

Everything here is ours, and we're not sour
We go salty in our hive, and its here live
Come look at our nice city 
And at Erik's bathhouse we're swimming

You can't take it from us 
Cause it's we that live here of course
Live here at The South with my two bros
They are mine, and not yours 

Yo, everybody whats up?
Here in The South you can chill, yup
Hang with your crew 
And skip out of school
I stand for my town, and I don't frown

Our avenue is the shit 
And I feel really lit 
One beer is all I need 
So I go home to my family

We eat dinner with a cigarette 
Then I go to the grill
And buy a hot dog 
That doesn't taste like hog

The South! The South!
It's here we are planted
The South! The South!
We take nothing for granted

The South! The South!
We live here all our life 
The South! The South!
We toke until we die

Arrive at Östermalm's Square
I miss The South and it doesn't feel fair
Buy candy for 1 - 2 coins
Then I go home with my boys

(Come on!) Here at The South
We have nice streets
And we make a lot of mischief
Go along hornsgatan with our luck
Then we go to Brother Tuck

(For anyone curious, the song is about the town Södermalm A.K.A. Söder ""Southernore or The South"" which is where Yung Lean and his friends grew up. It's known as the home of bohemian, alternative and hippie culture. Also being infamously known for its abundant drug use. I guess you could call it the San Fransisco of Sweden. Also Ginseng Strip 2002 was filmed there. Two videos showing parts of Söder: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-D5bGjWTzA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0HhGYN9jew )”"

I want to die today - what do I see?

I sleep, and awake and see nothing I crave
I see my own reflection then I see you on the television
You’re ugly, I’m ugly and the whole world it is really ugly 
Bad guys, nice guys? Ha, for me is mostly sheiße

I have been thinking nothing has been working
But that is what I always knew - yeah
because I see what happens after all
And I sit and smile, who the hell is that? The fuck are you? Where’s it at?

I want to die today - what do I see?
What is good? - any idea?
I want to die today - what do I see?
What is good? - any idea?

I sleep, and awake i see nothing I crave 
The first thing I see is my ugly face and I know exactly what to say;
Hi! Good to see ya! And I don’t wanna be ya! Not you, not she, not him, I would rather not be anyone if I can 

Cause today I want to pack my bags for good and leave everything that I took
Cause if it‘s gonna be like this I want to go to paradise
So I dab a little cotton in alcohol that I shove up my asshole, but it just burns and does nothing to my emotions, so

That kills your sense of self

Am I really dead?
Is my mind mislead?
So much of life unsaid

Evil is a product of my mind
Hollowing my judgement now I’m blind
Can’t discern left from right
Can’t tell dark from light 

I can’t find no peace
My brain has a disease 
They must have thrown away the keys
I know I cannot be released

I’m scared for no reason
I need Captain Disillusion
Save me from this mad intrusion 
Cause I’m no longer a person
