You really helped me through this i’ve read you’re comment atleast once or twice a day since you replied. it really gives me hope to see that someone would take time out of their day to make me feel better i will forever be thankful.
SuicideWatch,fkh0oyp,t3_fic73e,1584183690.0,i’m 16 and a couple of weeks ago i got removed from my dads house by dhs because he beat the shit outta me and yesterday i got the final report and my dad is right handed and it was the right side of my face that was messed up and he got off and report said that my injuries were self inflicted i had to move 2 hours away to live with my mom i had a girlfriend who i saw myself being with for the rest of my life i was dating her for over a year and a half and 11 days after being here she broke up with me i know my mom cares about me but i don’t feel like i can be here and honestly i’ve cut the shit outta my legs and my arms i jus feel numb all the time i’ve jus taken anything to not feel and i’m scared to kill myself and i try to be optimistic but it’s like nothing in my life matters anymore. my dad tried to reach out to me and he still won’t admit that he’s the one who hit me and it jus pisses me off even more that he was abusive to my mom and to me and yet she still pays him child support and alimony every month bc he doesn’t have a job. I also found out in the report the girl i was dating was interviewed and she pretty much said that she didn’t think he did it. i’m jus so lost
