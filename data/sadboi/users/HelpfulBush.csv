My PCOS symptoms are acne, excess hair and long cycles. My cycles used to be 33-45 days long. My last 4 cycles have been 28-29 days!!! (I've been eating meat about 8 months) and I can only attribute it to dietary changes because nothing else has changed. My acne is less I think due to more stable blood sugar.

I've found the vegan age that we now live in has made it so much harder. I constantly question if I'm doing the right thing. But my health has suffered greatly (I too have insane IBS and a host of other issues) so I just remind myself of that.

Tbh I started with fish. A tuna sandwich (memories from childhood) was easiest. Followed by salmon. 

Chicken is my favourite and easy to start with.

I can eat read meat but only in bolegnase or pies. I still gagged at steaks and chops. Which I'm hoping I will eventually enjoy as I really need to get my iron levels up. 

I try my hardest with my budget to buy grass-fed and pasture raised. But for your own mental health don't beat yourself up if you cannot afford or find any. 

I don't know if this was helpful at all. I know how it feels like a betrayal to your own life long beliefs. But you will overcome it eventually and you'll appreciate animal life so so so much. Something dies for something else to live."

I do find that many vegans have already got mental health issues prior to going vegan. And veganism can make them worse. I initially went vegan as it was an easy way to justify my eating disorder and used the rethoric of animals abuse and ""healthier living"" as reasons to defend my actions. So much so I believed what I said. Eating Disorders often stem from a lack of control, a feeling of being outcast, not being heard, feeling different. Yet veganism encompasses all of these feelings one way or another. So I don't think lack of meat would lead to depression and anxiety, more so, veganism attracts those with underlying anxieties and mental health issues."
