Go look at the percentages of the population in red states that consistently vote blue. In many states, it's a substantial minority of people.

Do you think it's easy to move? Educate yourself on how difficult it is to do this for a marginalized individual. Most will be forced to reside in these states.

Your position creates a very large amount of suffering for oppressed peoples, and I therefore condemn it. It is a regressive ""fuck you I got mine"" perspective, and it carries a nativistic quality considering how people who share your perspective tend to use regional caricatures and stereotypes to avoid thinking critically about what such a proposal would inflict upon those most vulnerable people in American society.

I've had serious suspicions that I have Asperger's for a while. I stim...I hyperfocus...I have special interests...I don't really ""connect"" with people in a deep way...I can be guilty of ruminating too intensely, etc.

What makes this interesting is that I am non-binary (a placeholder word as far as I'm concerned...I am simply me) and have been taking female hormones for almost two years now. I'm not looking for debate regarding trans identity...just looking to express thoughts.

I can see clearly now that I was alexithymic before, because hormones have amplified my experiencing of emotions making them easier to identify. I felt almost numb to it before...until a lack of emotional management led to outbursts of them.

I also definitely imitate social emotions. The past year has been almost like a revelation in terms of my advancement of my social skills. I am now actively and consciously faking my facial expressions, tone of voice, and managing my responses (always repressing my impulsive thoughts and instead saying what I believe is most socially intelligent...typically meaning something superficially pleasant or shallow). Being misanthropic helps my social skills because I know it is futile to be myself. I know to see people as evolved simians and little more. 

I also have serious empathy problems. I've gained much in terms of Theory of Mind skills (used to be awful at it), but I have issues with affective empathy.

I think you as the founder and your initial shareholders should be permitted to retain your ownership for as long you would like. I think the state ought to offer you a bid for your share, a bid you can refuse. Caveat: When you die the state takes ownership. You do not get to pass inheritance of capital assets to descendants. The state fashions itself into the public shareholder, but not the only shareholder (the others being primarily startup investors). The state does NOT manage the entities....it merely owns the profit.

In this manner, entrepreneurship is preserved. There is a place for investors. There is a motive to engage in competitive business (you make money and live a higher lifestyle). 

I also do not care about equitable profit sharing within organizations. Want to pay your CEO a billion a year while paying your janitor the minimum you possibly can? Go for it. It's chump change. 

This system would generate so much revenue for the state (in a fashion which does not require centralized state management as in more orthodox socialist systems) that you can actualize the libertarian wet dreams of eliminating the minimum wage, all business taxes, and all income taxes. The reason you can do this is because state revenue would upkeep all survival needs and higher needs (education, etc.) and would not require these revenue sources to fund it.

It would work and would be a superior system in terms of maximizing the potential of human capital of a society.

edmproduction,euh3nm3,t3_cgdhep,1563820223.0,"The vast majority of Western music is played in the Ionian and Aeolian mode (which is often altered to create harmonic minor). 

It sounds unnatural to play in other modes because you're so accustomed to these modes that your ear struggles to find a tonal center that isn't rooted on these two modes. Also, if you're playing chords in these modes, the dominant function chords are going to draw the tonal center back to these two modes.

There are several ways to play ""modally."" You can use the vagueness inherent to extended jazz fusion harmony to play modal scales over these kinds of chords. You can drone a note and play a mode over it. You can borrow chords from other modes in your harmony (one could argue that the V7 in harmonic minor is borrowed from Ionian. One could also argue the Neapolitan chord is borrowed from Phrygian). 

There are common uses of modes in popular music that you can find. Funk music often is a vamp on the root of the Mixolydian mode with occasional transitions, for instance.

I'd say your focus should be to learn the Ionian and Aeolian modes ""better."" If I played you a pop song with a ""I V vi IV"" progression, would you be able to perceive the harmony in the song? Could you write melodies over it? Would you be able to perceive secondary dominant function chords, like if I had a progression like ""I, V7/V, V, IV?"" 

The vast majority of the time for most writers, the traditional modes are going to give you the most bang for your effort. They've been the tonal anchors for centuries now for a good reason. Only when you start progressing beyond traditional harmony (as in you've got it fairly mastered) should you worry too much about other modes.
