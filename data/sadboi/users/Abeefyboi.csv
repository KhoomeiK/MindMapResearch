Parenting,floydby,t3_fpts91,1585347987.0,"Beyblades. My kid is obsessed with them. They are these spinning tops that you can battle with, they smash into each other and the loser bursts into pieces. They actually are really cool, but he talks nonstop about them. He interrupts conversations to share facts about them. He will just start going off about them to anyone with no concept that most people dont even know what they are, so everyone he comes in contact with is just confused af. 

Each beyblade has different stats so he gets obsessed with those. They have crazy names. He cant read or remember any of them. A name like gargoyle will become garganoid and the names constantly morph into something else since he cant remember what they are. Same thing for any facts hes learnee. Forgets them and just makes things up so everything is total nonsense. He'll ask us to google something about them, we give him the answer, he argues about it because he got confused somewhere along the say and made a bunch of stuff up.

There's also a FUCKING TV SHOW. It's a pokemon ripoff so these awkward hyper aggressive anime characters train and battle beyblades. He tells us about all the completely crazy and ineffective ways hes learned to launch a beyblade after watching the show. He screams 3, 2, 1, let it rip! every time he launches one. He plays the theme song on the Google home all the time. I could go on and on, obviously... look at the length of this comment. But I'll feel your pain big time.
