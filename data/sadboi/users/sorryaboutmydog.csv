He doesn't live with me, so she just does what she wants. When he is with me, I have him muzzled on walks and whenever there are people or dogs over.

That's some good reasoning for not greeting dogs on a leash. You never know how well trained the other dog is. Part of me wants him to socialize, but I know he needs space and safety. He is just not a dog that can handle other dogs yet."

I eant all doggies to be safe.

Any tips for having my dog stay calm when he sees another dog? Sometimes he can see them across the street, and stay calm, but as soon as a dog acknowledges him all hell breaks loose. I've had a dog be a couple feet away, and he was calm because it wasn't looking at him, but then they acknowledged him and he got reactive."

My family consists of my brother, me, and my single mom, so we are also close knit. Because it is just us, and my brother takes care of my mom because she is disabled, I am too afraid of tearing the family apart by addressing the trauma. I think about confronting my brother, because it seems like he has changed, but my worst fear is that he hasn't. That he will not acknowledge it, or apologize. I don't think I could handle it if that happened, so we just pretend it never did happen. My mom will never know the extent of it, because it would destroy her. Plus, where can she go?

My brother started with having me sit in his lap, he put his head on my chest or lap, he touched my butt going up the stairs etc. All these signs of what he was going to do, and I just ignored them and kept believing my big brother would never hurt me. I used to get nightmares every night, but I am on medication that stops them. You are such a strong person for being here today, and no matter what you did not deserve what happened to you. Sexual abuse does not need context, it is sexual abuse and you were the victim. So never think you deserved it.

Reporting is a difficult issue. I too can't report because he has made threats and attempts at my life, or I am afraid he will hurt my dog which is in his care while I am at school. He takes care of my disabled mom, too. My mom will never know the extent of what my brother did, it would ruin her life. She depends on him. So she doesn't know I see a trauma therapist, I live seperately.

Sadly, my brother has a great life. He has lots of money, a good job, a house..he seems happy. He doesn't deserve it, while I am low income, disabled, and have battled with homelessness. If there is some sort of higher power, he will get what he deserves. Maybe in death. 

He has changed a lot, and I wonder if I should talk to him about it, but I know that's a bad idea. Monsters like him don't change, they just get better at hiding it. I know he will never apologize or acknowledge it. If he's human, I hope it haunts him."

I too experienced self harm and suicidal ideation, ended up in the hospital multiple times. No one knew why.

I am also struggling to not self harm today, with all of these memories picking away at me. 

You're not alone in your pain. It's such a vulnerable state: sleeping. It's so cowardly of them, so sick of them. I'm so sorry you experienced what you did, and I know how it feels to be so close to them and then..just have your world shattered one night, and continue to shatter every night following.

CPTSD,fjayywg,t1_fj9hn75,1583183276.0,"Thank you for the suggestions. I am doing EMDR, so that's a plus, but my appointments are infrequent due to funding. No one has ever told me to grieve, though. I think I did a bit last night. I cried for a long time, because I could never cry back then."
CPTSD,fjaynca,t1_fjalhcu,1583183103.0,"Thank you. I am trying my best to keep on living, to succeed, but I am crippled by this trauma. I am literally on disability. I try to focus on my goals, like school, but the memories remain, eating away at me every day."
CPTSD,fjayexn,t1_fj8qic7,1583182976.0,"I could ruin his life by reporting him, but he has gotten me in a bad situation. He takes care of my disabled mother, and has my dog because I am in school. What am I going to do, ruin my mother's and dog's life just so I can get revenge? It's not worth it."
adultsurvivors,fjay2hq,t1_fj9jvgi,1583182792.0,"I'm sorry it was so triggering, but appreciate your kind words. It kind of just fell out of me.

I do have a trauma therapist, who I am thinking of seeing more often to be honest. Right now things are rough.

I hope I can heal, I just need to find those parts of me that are still alive. I think they're there, because I am still here."
adultsurvivors,fjaxon8,t1_fjawkta,1583182586.0,Thank you. I hope I can heal.
adultsurvivors,fjaxl77,t1_fj94evg,1583182534.0,"Thank you for your kind words. I'm sorry if it was too triggering. 

I just wish I moved, that I did something to stop it. Asked for help, told my mom. Maybe he would have stopped. Instead I just took it until I moved out.

I agree he is a monster. In the end, I don't want to actually die. I have a good life now, people that love me, a beautiful dog. But the pain is just always there. The memories are always there. I just want those to go away, and nothing is working."

adultsurvivors,fjawprk,t1_fjaa1ag,1583182058.0,I truly hope he does. I hope someday he gets what he deserves.
adultsurvivors,fjawlvi,t1_fj8r6oc,1583181998.0,"Thank you for your kind words. Logically, I know I didn't deserve it, but it's hard to accept. It's hard to accept someone could be so cruel."
