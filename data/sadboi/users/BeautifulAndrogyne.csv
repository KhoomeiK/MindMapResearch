zen,fqktmyv,t1_fqjcbjk,1589435949.0,"Interesting response. I liked the example you used because to me it sounded like it represented spiritual transcendence and mental illness equally, which I think is kind of the point. I’m not sure they can be totally separated, like there is always an element of one in the other. And aren’t people who consider themselves enlightened generally pretty isolated? Like they believe they’re operating on a higher plane that nobody else could possibly understand. That sounds a bit like mental illness too. I almost feel like people who strive towards these ideals can’t possibly take them that seriously because they’re almost better in theory than in actual practice.

Maybe it comes down to whether the perspective is helping the person or not, although I don’t think an ‘insane’ person is necessarily in a position to judge that for themselves, and is anyone really completely sane anyway? And also whether the person has a community of support that validates them. Like how hermit monk-like behavior would seem totally normal in Tibet but out of place in many parts of the west. I really do think that sanity is in part an ability to adapt to one’s environment- even if it is, as another commenter pointed out, a sick or dishonest society."
zen,fqirc3o,t1_fqip5h4,1589399826.0,"The lines blurry, isn’t it?

zen,fqiqsv3,t1_fqiitpi,1589399621.0,"Thank you for writing that out. I actually did experience something akin to what u describe many years ago and at the time I did experience it as a kind of liberation or spiritual awakening, and I saw the lack of a sense of self as a sort of evolved helpful perspective. But the more time has gone by the more I’ve had to question that view of it, how detached I was from regular emotional reactions to things and called it progress. We’re supposed to get angry and upset and afraid and it’s supposed to be a personal, visceral experience. We’re not supposed to be removed from our emotions or be detached from our own experiences.

I never really felt solid or grounded after that and long term it has affected my life in a negative way, I think it’s made it harder for me to find balance and create healthy boundaries between myself and others. It seems to me like the level of non attachment that supposed spiritual masters talk about might be both a bit unhealthy and impractical."
zen,fqi6688,t1_fqi1tha,1589390977.0,"Not really, I just think the overlap between those who believe they’ve transcended regular consciousness and those who seem to live outside of regular consciousness is interesting.

zen,fqgsnkv,t1_fqgsaas,1589355815.0,I agree with most of what you’re saying. But most of the people I’ve met who were socially isolated were profoundly less balanced than average. I think in order to be truly balanced there needs to be some sense of fitting in with the whole. Even if you’re right that the 1 in 30 person is the one who sees things most clearly- is it really helpful for them to never learn how to adapt to society? To meet people where they are? If they were really that enlightened wouldn’t they figure out a way to make themselves fit in the world and connect with the 29 “wrong” people around them? Otherwise what’s the point of anything?
zen,fqgsa23,t1_fqgrule,1589355470.0,"See now I don’t mean this in a derogatory way at all, but that really does sound like mental illness to me. I’ve had moments in my life when I was sure I was seeing through to the deepest truths about reality and to this day I don’t know if I was awakening to some deeper truth or going insane. I honestly think a lot of it just has to do with who happens to be around when it happens- the perspectives of those in your life and the culture you grew up in. It’s comfortable to make those distinctions and obviously I don’t think all crazy people are enlightened or visa versa, not at all, but I think there’s more overlap than has really been explored."

Judging others intentions when they would do you harm, judging what might or might not have a negative affect on someone else? 

You can say what you want about our society but in order to have a fulfilling life one must find a way of existing in it, of meeting people where they are and connecting with them. Of finding a place in the world that allows for fulfillment and change and experience and growth.

zen,fqgp3k7,t1_fqgo62r,1589352597.0,"But isn’t it important to deal with life as it really is, warts and all, rather than as we wish it to be- for example as a place where we don’t get bullied or traumatized and everyone just loves each other?

zen,fqgoub2,t1_fqgojxl,1589352372.0,"So what would you call someone who retreats from life to live in a cave or a monastery? Is that functioning inside of society? Also I have to say I think labels can be useful- in psychology especially because it makes it easy to connect with the current understanding of what you or someone else might be going through- insights that may never have occurred to you, the most effective treatments, and can help you connect with people who have had similar experiences."

zen,fqgmn1s,t1_fqgkvvx,1589350474.0,"Thanks for this. Well have to agree to disagree about cynicism, that’s actually a deep love of mine. I do find the article you linked interesting- it contends that disassociation is linked to a reluctance towards emotional processing. But couldn’t you say the same thing about giving up attachments, desires and earthly concerns? Kind of sounds like a more socially acceptable method for avoiding the processing of emotional pain- the pain of unrequited love or loss, of learning that you’re someone who’s incompatible with their own needs or desires. Just learn to transcend all of it and people will call you enlightened. Is there really a difference between that and someone who learns to check out because they can’t or don’t want to process their feelings?"
zen,fqgld06,t1_fqgknj1,1589349410.0,But is that all enlightenment is? Just not being overly attached to any particular thought? U get that down and you got it in the bag?
zen,fqgk25h,t1_fqgjer6,1589348367.0,To say that an enlightened person is not attached to any string of thoughts wouldn’t that mean that they weren’t invested in anything? Wouldn’t it be natural for a healthy person to be attached to thoughts or circumstances involving a loved one or major life events for example? To say that there is no attachment to any particular string of thoughts makes it sound like they could react to the injury of a loved one or losing their job for example with indifference.
zen,fqgj60q,t1_fqghms5,1589347670.0,"I’ve seen a lot of people touting ego death as some kind of ultimate spiritual attainment but in my experience lacking a strong ego is not a healthy way to live in the world, even though I can see how it gets in the way of perspective when taken too seriously. And the communicating with deities thing was something I was reading about in a book on Tibetan Buddhism earlier, but also seems to come up a lot with people who are involved in psychedelics which seems to have a lot of overlap with Buddhist thought. It does kind of seem like all of this comes down to whether you are in control of the phenomena or not. But I still struggle to understand how something like lacking an ego or transcending regular states of consciousness (disassociation or enlightenment)can have such profoundly different connotations in different contexts."
zen,fqgie6t,t1_fqghyed,1589347077.0,I do appreciate the immensity if what I’m asking and to be honest I’m surprised that it doesn’t seem to have been explored more as it seems to be kind of a glaring issue in most kinds of spiritual thinking.

zen,fqgf150,t1_fqgdabn,1589344604.0,"Thank you for the thoughtful answer. I have a few points of clarification. In the first example you say that sanity requires that the person acknowledge that the interaction with said entity wasn’t real. But a lot of supposedly sane people believe that they have had interactions with entities beyond this realm- be it people who believe they’ve communicated with a dead loved one, people who were on psychedelics like ayahuasca, or those in other cultures, including Buddhist cultures, where communicating with non physical entities is a regular part of life and culture. Interacting with supposed deities is a presence in pretty much every religion.

For example my brother once awoke in the middle of the night to a dream about a campsite he was at catching fire which caused him to wake and investigate, only to discover that the campsite had caught fire and thus he was able to wake everyone and avert a potential disaster. Was his premonition “real” or just coincidence? Ask eastern philosophy and western psychology and you’ll get two very different answers. Granted he was asleep but I’ve heard accounts of awake people experiencing similar events.

I also find the issue of dissociation an interesting one. In psychology it’s considered a method of escaping traumatic feelings or memories- disconnecting from reality to protect the mind. But it really does sound remarkably similar to transcendent states of consciousness- all earthly concerns and feelings wiped away as you transcend to a higher level. Maybe the distinction is whether the state is under your conscious control or not?"
zen,fqgdndy,t1_fqgdi85,1589343626.0,So I’d have to be insane to understand your answer?

zen,fqgcpfa,t1_fqgcdwh,1589342984.0,But what about the people you see on the streets incoherently babbling to themselves?

zen,fqgci72,t1_fqgc6p8,1589342849.0,I went through something when I was young that at the time felt very much like a spiritual awakening and that as the years passed has felt more and more like some kind of psychological breakdown instead.

“The idea of not giving a fuck is a simple way of reorienting our expectations for life and choosing what is important and what is not. Developing this ability leads to something I like to think of as a kind of ‘practical enlightenment ‘.

No, not that airy-fairy, eternal bliss, end-of-all-suffering, bullshitty kind of enlightenment. On the contrary, I see practical enlightenment as becoming comfortable with the idea that suffering is always inevitable- that no matter what you do, life is comprised of failures, loss, regrets, and even death. Because once you become comfortable with all the shit that life throws at you (and it will throw a lot of shit, trust me), you become invincible in a sort of low-level spiritual way. After all, the only way to overcome pain is to first learn how to bear it.”

As someone who is weirdly sensitive to other people’s energy I do think it has impacted my ability to regulate my emotions and create healthy boundaries, so I do think there’s a correlation there.
