depression,f5p4sm2,t3_dlfw2v,1572348634.0,"I'm a coward as well, but...the constant sizing up of a passing train, bus, car etc etc...is a thought and motion that is on a loop of continuous repetition for me. Honestly, the drumming of 'what is the point of all of this' and 'just do it...!!!!' Some days, the drums of these phrases beat even louder than the drums in Phil Colin's "" In the Air Tonight""....I'm honestly exhausted and just over these strings of life been plucked as much as they are....It is hard to find the motivation and I can relate"
