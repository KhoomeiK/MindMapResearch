Mindfulness,fkd0vya,t3_fhgylx,1584065683.0,"Exactly, instead of allowing emotions to run you, or against you, you allow them to run through you. This is not ignoring thoughts/feelings, rather its ignoring the overreaction to them. We have to think of these things in practical terms as with the coronavirus we may think,""I need to have better hygeine and inform myself of the symptoms"", these are thoughts that are practical and things we can solve in the moment, instead of thoughts like, ""oh no I'm going to die what if I get pneumonia""  etc, this is not a practical thought and living in that thought stresses the nerves unnecessarily, there is no danger at the moment, but we should be practical about the virus itself. 

Fear is one of our many emotions and its there for a reason to keep us safe, however far too many have an unhealthy relationship with fear, in that it forces them to obsess rather than act, i.e. we may fear and obsess over the virus, or we act on the information we have in the best practical way possible and then move on with this new information. I tell people all the time, you need to stick to calm and calculated behavior, not imagination when it comes to solving problems (but be mindful that its even a problem to begin with), sitting down or even pacing while stuck in the minds fearful imaginations isn't going to solve anything. Fear in itself isn't necessarily a bad thing, its our relationship with the emotion that can create internal conflict."

running,fjbzd31,t3_fcgtow,1583204809.0,"Sounds like a fun race! Lemme also point out that for a pre-race meal its good to experiment with your long runs during your training so you don't have to change much, just whatever works (this is what my trainer told me and I ran a successful sub 2 hour half twice). On Saturday was my long run and I found that eating a smoothie 2-3 hours prior to my run and then munching on some watermelon would last me the entire run. I stuck to this for my races and it worked perfectly. Not surprisingly when I ran my 3rd half I did not stick to my normal meals the night before and pre-race and I still finished pretty strong just had some stomach complications (side aches) during the race."

Mindfulness,fjafmtk,t3_fccd5s,1583172511.0,"Yup thinking we have control of what thoughts we have is a futile attempt at controlling our subconscious and therefore becoming a pawn in its ""game"",  Instead we focus on our reaction, we allow thoughts to come in and not give them any judgement. What I've done in the past, is count the thoughts, I'd assign them a number and anytime I'd catch myself engaging in these thoughts I'd back out and once again start assigning them numbers, you'd be surprised at how quickly thoughts come in during times when the nerves are energized and how much it slows down as soon as the nerves are relaxed. The thoughts will seem very odd as they move from things that make you feel stressed, to what you ate last weekend for example, its just information and memory."

survivinginfidelity,fj4jswd,t3_fbcqp7,1583009917.0,"My ex-wife explained me this way and to an extent she was ""sort of"" right. She complained how we never go out and that we just spend weekends at home etc. and all I do is watch sports and game, and thats why she cheated because I never wanted to do anything. We have kids, its hard to get out. I worked a ton of hours trying to provide her with everything possible she wanted, nice house, nice car (neither of which was good enough for her, always some complaint), and we went on vacations just not every month like she wanted, ffs we went on a super expensive Vegas trip 4 months before Dday. I was basically killing myself mentally and physically trying to keep her and the kids happy, once we divorced however, I dropped that charade, started focusing on my own happiness and have been WAY better off. 

Point is, these people are never happy no matter what it is, and cheating/leaving is usually some attempt at happiness in another person, situation, relationship etc. it might ""work"" from a practical standpoint but I assure you that superficial happiness they think they have, will run out quick. I knew this with my ex-wife, hence her multiple attempts to get back with me once she realized this."
vegan,fj4bpse,t1_fj2eknk,1583004633.0,"Yeah its true when people say going vegan they are changing their lifestyle but the point is, nobody said anything during their fastfood/alcohol lifestyle. I am one such example, I'd drink and eat mcdonalds all the time, nobody said a word, as soon as I told people I was vegan all of a sudden everyone around me became health and nutrition experts."

Mindfulness,fj1jfyg,t1_fj1ikno,1582921343.0,"By understanding that all thoughts are not legitimate to the situation you are in, its just presentation of info, as in ""this could happen maybe or it couldn't"" its just the mind giving us information, our habit is that we feel energized and so we give into these negative thoughts, feed them with our judgements and therefore begin trying to intrepret them as either bad or good, when really its not a representation of self, its just what ""self"" is seeing, perception, etc. its not reality."
Anxiety,fj11jdg,t1_fizp460,1582911387.0,"They think the same things as everyone else, the mind is constantly analyzing our surroundings, bringing up memories, its like a huge information hub that brings info to our attention 24/7. People who are unaffected by stress simply don't respond as harshly as those who are affected by a great deal of stress. When the body is experiencing stress the increase in information becomes greater because the mind is simply trying to keep us safe, its for survival, however many have a habit of reacting very negatively to thoughts and imagination and thus create a cycle of over-reaction and resulting stress response that repeats itself until the body can find balance and heal."
