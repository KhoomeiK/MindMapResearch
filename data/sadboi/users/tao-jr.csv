Now, I am trying to see the effects of different ‚Äúpolicies‚Äù like a lockdown on disease spread. I still use percolation in disease modeling to see how the population travel and its effects on disease spread.

I use Netlogo now. I just learned this two weeks ago and finished my codes last week.  This way, I can see how they actually move from time to time. It‚Äôs a very interesting way to model systems mainly because you can see processes work as they happen. Not much people use Netlogo, I think the number of users are in hundred thousands only. 

Their manual is available online and it has pre-built models you can experiment with."

You can see the job postings on linkedin. I earn around 13k per week on that job.

peyups,fq20o91,t3_ggi0sr,1589051774.0,"1. You can opt to take a Master's instead. It's shorter and more advanced but you will surely need to take back courses in their undergrad. However, if you really want to pursue a second undergrad degree in agri or foresty, you are not eligible for UPCAT anymore. So, I suggest that you inquire at the Office of the University Registrar and CAFS or CFNR to ask how to get an admission in their program given your situation. I think there is also substantial funding for these programs from DOST, IRRI, or UP itself.
2. If there's no funding available for you, UP Graduate School costs Php 1,000 per unit. So if you take a program full-time, which is 9-12 units each semester, it'll cost you Php 9,000 - Php 12,000 per semester. Plus, lodging and food. Dormitories inside the campus are extremely affordable.

Good luck and congrats on deciding to pursue your dream. Remember that the heart of UP education is *utak at puso.*"

Everything is really different in mathematics since we do not have the labs and as much funding as the other fields do, unless you‚Äôre in applied mathematics. But I did have a research project since my undergraduate program involves a thesis. You can ask a faculty member if you can do a little project with them and express your interest in graduate school. I asked two faculty members in my university (one in math and one in physics), to collaborate with me and they agreed. It‚Äôs worth it. They still reach out to me for research projects.
