I only ask since my Dad believes in Q and I've managed to get him to pull it back by about 95% to the point where he barely mentions it and doesn't obsess over it like he used to.

But then it was easier for me because I used to believe in Q as well, so I knew just as much about it as he did, if not more which means I could ask him pointed questions which he couldn't ignore.

(a) Do you accept there is a possibility, however small, 10%, 1%, 0.0000001%, whatever that Q is full of shit?

(She has to answer yes, there's always a chance.)

(b) What would it take for you to accept that Q is full of shit?

(Let her say whatever)

(c) Eventually, when Trump leaves office either next year or 2024 and nothing has happened, no mass arrests, no military tribunals, no nothing, will you accept that it was bullshit?

(Mass arrests/military tribunals/etc are the CRUX of the entire Qanon conspiracy. That is what Q has been promising since Day 1 so if that isnt delivered then its undeniably a con job)

Just try and incept the idea that its crap into her head, she 100% has her doubts, she must, Q has been promising and promising and nothing's happened.

Also ask her why the FISA IG Report by Horowitz concluded that the FBI had reason to start the investigation? Q has been fkn crapping on about the FISA report blowing this wide open.

Not to mention that with 8Chan went down, that Q is gone, forever, FOREVER. ""No. Outside. Comms.""

That's it, Q is never coming back, so how is that possible? Ask her how the ""greatest intelligence operation of ALL TIME"" can take down a fkn ancient and powerful global cabal of pedophiles and the worst of the worst, BUT CANT KEEP A FKNG WEBSITE UP.

In the end I just asked him what would it take for him to believe Q was bullshit? What about when Trump eventually gets out of office, at this election or the next, if there's no arrests, no disclosure, no nothing would he accept that he had been deceived? 

Try that route, I think it's important not to judge either of our fathers, fundamentally you want him to move away from it on his own, so ask him what he would think if Trump leaves office and nothing changed.

academiceconomics,f1yp668,t1_f1ym50v,1569821268.0,"> The heavy reliance on the normal distribution in the teaching of economic statistics is usually justified by appealing to the central limit theorem.

It is argued that the conditions required for nonnormal stable limits are, in fact, frequently satisfied by economic variables and in particular by disturbance terms in regressions. Normal theory results should, therefore, be used with caution, and it might be wise for economic statisticians to devote more attention to robust statistical methods.

academiceconomics,f1ydjdd,t1_f1y69cn,1569814272.0,"> Most labour economists care about whether education is directly the cause of any change in wages or is something else proxy-ing for any change in earnings. They care about using the data to explain something. 

Look let's just this point for example and let me see if I can communicate my idea better then I have:

*1. Increasing the educational attainment of men without a college degree will increase their average earnings and their likelihood of being employed.*

If this was actually the case, then why not go ahead and run a simple A/B test on a group of men without a degree vs. a group of men who are literally bought a degree from some overseas degree factory.

But you dont need to, because everyone knows that literally just having a degree will no doubt have some marginal impact on your hirability, but in the end it won't do anything. Because a degree is a piece of paper and the overwhelming majority of what anyone learns at Uni is not really relevant to a specific job, as a result most training of almost any job is on the job training.

So obviously it's actually about the skillset you gain from committing to a degree, putting in the hours, over a long period of time, being responsible, delaying gratification etc etc 

In the same vein, how can the simple fact that minimum wage which acts like a price floor, which literally *forces* people not to work for an amount less than stated, *even if they want to*. I mean sure you can say ""No one should have to work for such low pay"" and ye that's a great and obviously ideal situation, but completely irrelevant to how society actually works, good things happen to bad people, bad things happen to good people, life isnt fair, build a bridge and get over it.

A business will only hire someone if they make more money then they cost. You can laugh and scoff at the notion of someone wanting to work for $1 an hour but no one has a gun to their head, obv there will be extennuating circumstances but fundementally they aren't forced to work for $1 an hour. If they deem it worth their while, and so does the employer, why shouldn't they be allowed to? Specifically say adults say, not children obv. Instead they're literally forced *not* to work. 

Who would consider such a crap wage? Oh I don't know, people with disabilities, intellectual or physical, people who dont speak the same language and oh I don't know, men who never went to, forget college, high school? Like literally the least employable workers in society, rightly or wrongly, the bottom of the barrel. 

Because its not about the wage, it's about skills, thats why they should be allowed to work, thats why a simple piece of paper from the University of Northern Barbados wont help, waking up early, dressing respectably, getting to work on time, on the job skills, all of that, having a work history on your resume, etc etc etc. 

None of that is considered in any model with initial conditions with randomised data or otherwise, because the model is static, its a snapshot of things in time, then we use it to provide context to data to discern information, except the relationship between the initial conditions, the data and the model isn't static, it changes, it's dynamic, it's a feedback loop, and that is something that no amount of data however randomised will be able to help with, because it's literally a problem with the superstructure of the construct we've created.

TL;DR - Also I mean, honestly, Central Limit Theorem highlights exactly why the very concept of analysing ***ANY*** causal link is fundamentally flawed, because given enough data points, any two variables, in the entire universe, say oh I dont know, a sample of a population, the more people in the sample (around 32+ which is very low considering samples are usually around 1k) then it doesnt matter how random your samples are, how many samples you have, ever, because the sample will ***ALWAYS*** end up approximating a normal distribution.

You will always ALWAYS find some magnitude of a causal relationship, we literally measure it from a scale of 0 to 1. Like I said, I have a maths background not just an <-

academiceconomics,f1vgen9,t1_f1v0n3x,1569770572.0,">I recently had some discussions regarding the works of Menger, Hayek etc (Austrian school) and to me their view points have validity (although I'm not terribly acquainted with their theories), but I found it surprising how they are regarded as ""outcasts"" and ""problematic to the field of economics"".

Oh man, I feel you so hard lol, 100%

Like just look at say the [Wikipedia article on Inflation.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation)

Straight off the bat, the first line, ""*In economics, inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time.*""

Like um, no? Wrong. An increase in the price of goods and services is a result of inflation, it is **not** inflation itself. 

Then all the way down, with some pithy almost disdainful tone it [barely has two lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation#Austrian_view) on what the Austrian school says: *The Austrian School stresses that inflation is not uniform over all assets, goods, and services. Inflation depends on differences in markets and on where newly created money and credit enter the economy.[citation needed] Ludwig von Mises said that inflation should refer to an increase in the quantity of money that is not offset by a corresponding increase in the need for money, and that price inflation will necessarily follow.*

Like are you kidding me? Do you really not understand or accept that ""inflation"" is simply an increase in the supply of money? Or you know, in other words, *an inflation of the money supply.* I mean to me, that just makes so much sense, it's so self-evident and easily digestible that I simpy cannot understand why this concept is not accepted as the obvious truth.

Austrian economics IMO is so logical, so explainable, so understandable and more than anything, so beautiful and elegent in its simplicity. 

But simply because Austrian economists correctly and insightfully identify that empircal evidence is only one type of evidence, that quantitative data is not the only data that needs to be considered, they are literally thought of as loons.

It's seriously like if we lived in a world where the only genre of movie was horror, and some people put this idea out there that ""Oh maybe you know, we can look at *other* genres of movies, maybe, just maybe, theres more to movies than just horror?"". But instead, because everyone only knows movies of the genre horror, they dismiss this idea as ridiculous because ""if its not horror, its not a movie."" 

It'd be actually really funny if it wasn't so stupid. 

But honestly, this isnt unique to economics, this is seriously a battle that has been raging across almost every field of study, every discipline, for thousands of years. From what I have observed, it literally goes back to Plato vs. Aristotle and the very nature of what is truth.

Aristotle argued that truth can be inferred from observation. Plato argued that truth is independent of observation. For example, in the universe, all life as we know it, requires the presence of water. We have observed no other way for life to come into existence. Aristotle would then say that a statement such as ""Water is required for life"" is objectively true. Whereas Plato would say that is incorrect, just because we have only observed life requiring water, that does not mean that all life in the entire universe requires water. Because say if there was a planet on which life developed without the presence of water, well that would still be true even if we thought it was impossible and were never able to observe it. 

I mean even if you dont think that such a philosophy or way to approach life is very practical or useful in the real world, which is a fair statement IMO, you should still be able to accept and understand Plato's position as, well, true (zing).

So ye, I mean I know I'm going to come off as a real arrogant twat, but one Einstein's of quotes just about sums it up for me.

academiceconomics,f1uwg9m,t3_dauwa3,1569764453.0,"Tbh I'm defs not across machine learning, non-linear or otherwise, but I agree with the basic premise you're putting forward.

Engineering deals with inanimate objects, in broad strokes, like Physics, it's an axiomatic science. 

However, even in Physics, it's accepted that what you observe you also change, i.e. Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. 

Economics is not an axiomatic science, it's a social science, it deals with people, not inanimate objects, and as you so eloquently said, ""People are not machines that behave in a precise predictable fashion.""

This basic and critical difference IMO is completely lost on, well, almost every Economist. I know that isn't literally true but in all my years the number of Economists who understand this that I've observed is barely a handful. 

Simply put, people put way too much emphasis and focus on their models, on their fit and on their results. There's this idea that if they can just tweak it properly, somehow they will find the perfect prediction model.

I think it's, to put it mildly, retarded, because as Godell's Incompleteness Theorem states that any and all models are either incomplete or inconsistent. No one wants their model to be inconsistent, so they are always incomplete. Pair that with the Local Knowledge Problem and the absurdity of such a goal becomes clear. They literally might as well be aiming to turn lead into gold.

I'm not saying that applied mathematics and modelling and etc are not insanely useful and very much a part of any economic analysis, but they aren't the be-all and end-all. Unfortunately, especially these days, Economics as an academic area of study has been inundated by applied mathematicians, computer scientists and even physicists who are great at crunching numbers but have no basic or fundamental appreciation or desire to appreciate the less quantitive, tangible and empircal aspects of human behaviour and ergo Economics.

Just reminds me of something my Economics prof used to say, ""Asking an Economist to predict the future is like trying to drive a car using the rear-view mirror.""

Would def love to read more of your work though."

First step, contact your professor, explain to him/her your situation, he'll point you in the right direction. Email them, meet with them, they'll help you, they love a student who works hard to be better.

Second, practice. Practice, practice, practice. Math is about one thing and one thing only, PRACTICE. Even proofs, there's only so many different tricks and ways to approach proofs that can be asked.

Thirdly don't skip steps, take shortcuts, if you don't know the basics well you won't be able to do the hard stuff. Look at the textbook, further reading, past papers and most of all don't get discouraged even if you think you aren't making progress.
