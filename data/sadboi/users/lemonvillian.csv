I do need to focus more on the different ways our relationship is vs the similarities of previous relationships. And also loving myself unconditionally. It has been about a year of struggling trying to figure out who I am and why I let these toxic relationships tear me down. But I’ve come such a long way from the girl I used to be. I feel like I’ve transformed into a woman. 
He is supportive and we seem to have a really close friendship which is super important to me. He gets my humor and we always have a great laugh. 

He kisses me with such passion. I didn’t know it could even exist. But he does! And I’m so excited. 

Thank you again for taking your time to respond :)"
dating,f4h6qqx,t3_dkgtth,1571588531.0,"I have been in a similar situation myself. Once I met someone that I had previously wanted to have a relationship with, but we never had the opportunity to meet. We spent a good portion of that time hanging out. We had sex once, but he continually wanted me to say things that felt weird to me. Afterwards we hung out some more. And then before we fell asleep, he wanted another round. He told me how he had jerked it to me for the past 6 months. Which I was fine with, but during it he switched it and asked me to tell him romantic things. It was like my brain died. I was like “iiii have no idea what you’re talking about” and he said, “ you know, everyone always says dirty things.. say romantic things about me. No one does that.” It was so awkward because I didn’t have anything romantic to say. Like at all. So I got up and he was like, “everything okay?” And I told him no. I’m not used to that and it made me feel uncomfortable. He was fine with it. I needed sleep and I was at his house so I just slept next to him.

relationship_advice,f4h3iu7,t1_f4gpbnq,1571587691.0,"I truly hope so. He was in a toxic/emotionally abusive marriage. They have a kid. The ex is still very unpredictable. But he loves his son more than anything. I don’t have any kids, but I’m in love with his son and I haven’t even met him yet. He sends me all kinds of pictures and videos of this kid. I can’t wait to meet him. 

I was in a toxic/emotionally abusive relationship for 2 years. He makes me feel so comfortable. Even when I met him for the first time, I could tell things were different. 

I’m just hoping he feels the same way. I’m afraid that when he tells his ex about me, that she will disapprove and try to take his son away. There isn’t anything wrong with me. It’s just that she is the type of person that thinks “if I can’t have him, no one can” so she would try to hurt him through using her son. 

It’s just a lot of emotions. And I’m trying to figure out where we stand. Because I don’t want to get too attached. But I think that has definitely already happened. 😂😂😂"

Scorpio,f02hup5,t3_d32xqc,1568331166.0,"I know I’m a little bit older (29f) but it’s taken me some time to figure out why I do the things I do. Especially my Scorpio-like tendencies. There could be a part of him that was extremely overwhelmed. Especially if he comes from a background where he’s had his trust and heart broken before. And I’m not talking about just romantic relationships, but familial and friendship relationship as well. It seems, as least for me, that every time someone who I trusted broke my heart, I put a wall up. And then another wall. And another. And even though Scorpio’s crave that intimacy with someone - especially like the kind you described that you two had - it’s hard to open up. I’ve done it before to good men and not even mean to. I would distance myself because everything felt so right. Everything was going so good. But it’s terrifying. Because at the end of the day my biggest fear was that they would leave like everyone else did. So you back away. And the walls that were torn down get built back up. You don’t mean to hurt the other person. You want the other person. But the fear from being broken is stronger and it makes them pull back to reanalyze the situation. 

I’m not saying that he will never reach out to you. But he probably does need this space. Time to think and figure out what’s going on in his head. Being 17 and talking about a future like that is probably really overwhelming. We go with our emotions and then it’s like our brains are like “whoa.. wait a minute. Let’s chill and think.”

Give him time. And if you cannot wait, I would just do like the person above suggested and say,

“I like you, but respect where you’re at. Maybe we can work things out in the future.”

And just leave it at that. Too much pressure on a Scorpio will only make them run in the opposite direction."
