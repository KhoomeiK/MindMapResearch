over the weekend, az did a massive ""testing blitz"" which we're still waiting on the results from, but this will give us a much better idea of who has been infected, where.

arizona is also doing a really great job being transparent with reporting COVID data, which is excellent for keeping the public informed with what is going on, but also means that they are tracking cases and tests, along with other info, which could potentially help with contact tracing, etc.

az is also taking steps towards mass testing in nursing homes!

in anecdotal news, i live in az and had to run a quick errand to target today. almost everyone was wearing masks, abiding by social distancing, etc. i felt very safe!

there's also been some evidence (lower in this thread) that heat helps kill the virus, which would be excellent for AZ and our scorching hot summers! the only time i have ever wanted to suffer in 115 degree heat.

hope this helps:)"
