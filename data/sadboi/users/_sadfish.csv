BPD,fn1u4kq,t3_fyh7we,1586570159.0,I get this 1000 percent. Someone i thought I was close to posted this thing about best friends and tagged a bunch of people and left me out and I just don’t feel close to any women at the moment and it hurts so badly
SuicideWatch,fmdpnv9,t3_fuj2os,1585974182.0,I feel this way sometimes too.. when’s ur birthday love? I’m turning 21 on April 26th
BPD,fljjrj3,t3_fp8g1x,1585215590.0,"Thank you, thank you, thank you. I’m so young but yet I feel so old. I’m lost. And I really appreciate your kindness.
You’re right❤️
And It’s like I’ve been trying for so long yet I feel like I’ve moved nowhere. I care so much. That’s the thing.. I just wanna shut off and stop caring at all"
Marriage,fiovoxu,t3_f8k9kv,1582592092.0,that’s so cute omg 🥺
relationship_advice,fi6xykd,t3_f6lj0o,1582210074.0,"From a monogamous woman’s standpoint, and someone that’s been in a relationship for about 5 months now with my sweetheart..❤️
I really wouldn’t feel comfortable with him living alone with another woman. This isn’t me being jealous or making accusations of him cheating or anything like that. It’s just me not being comfortable with the situation. You know your friendship is JUST that, a platonic friendship. But your significant other doesn’t know the deepness or intensity of the friendship and what it can turn into spending that much time together. Especially alone. This doesn’t mean your friendship has to end! By no means! I’d say it would make ur gf feel a lot better if she knew your friend a little better and spent some time around her to get comfortable. I think she’s setting boundaries. Not being toxic like all these other comments are saying. And try to flip the situation as well. Would you be comfortable with her living with a guy friend? Would you have worries or concerns?"

He’s always totally cool about it 😂

You realized what you lost.
You learned ur lesson.
Now when you find someone u care about next time don’t blow it ♥️"
relationship_advice,fdrcsb0,t3_emrfdx,1578682594.0,"Honestly. I’d call it quits..knowing that it seems hard right now because you guys have spent a decent amount of time together. But how will you look at him the same? You’ll always remember what he did to you when things got tough. Just because things get tough doesn’t mean you give up on your partner. You seem strong and steady right now, and while your still strong and steady I’d find a way to strengthen through it and get out. Hopefully he’s learned his lesson. But he shouldn’t be taught that he can do this to someone he apparently “loves”. 
I’m sorry he’s put you through this. Someone is out there for you. To treat you with respect, love, loyalty and compassion. You aren’t crazy. You care. And you deserve so much more. ♥️"
relationship_advice,fd4pcs0,t3_ejuwiw,1578169723.0,"Imagine when it’s right in front of you. It fucking sucks... I’ve seen it first hand. It makes me feel like I’m not special and that he just touches anyone sensual like that:( 
Let her know that it’s a boundary for you and that it makes you uncomfortable. Hopefully she will understand and STOP doing it. It’s not okay."
relationship_advice,fc3pf7e,t3_eg0h17,1577395330.0,Thank you ♥️
relationship_advice,fc3ncm4,t1_fc3mnrc,1577393836.0,I definitely feel like my bf is that same way! He has a ton of girl friends as well and he’s super extroverted and friendly.I just get curious of the girls that are just pretty and he doesn’t have much of a friendship with at all. Like I wonder what’s going through that head of his lol😂
