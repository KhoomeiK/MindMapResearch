india,fobl1cj,t1_fob3zt2,1587660901.0,"I want to point out a few things. First, the scenario is changing. The 'systematic-oppression' is not as severe as it was a decade ago. Nor will it be a decade from now. 

Secondly, as for good engineering colleges, i.e. the IITs, I believe it is not much of a factor. Nothing stands against merit. It's a very tainted allegation against a reputed institution which you should substantiate with evidence.

 The 'indirect effect' I talked of is between economic disparity and merit which you do not deny. You go on to talk about privilege.Thirdly, you're generalizing it enough for it to become a true statement. Of course privilege leads to merit. Define success first. Here there are two stages: before and after admission. Pre admission, do you think coaching centers give a shit about caste? It's all about money. 

The solution you propose is limited to only one sect. It doesn't take care of economic status one bit. Rich and poor from that sect get more opportunities. Poor from other sects need a separate ammendment to their name.

If you are going to say leave it all upto the experts and decades of research, and there's no point of further discussion I'd like to point out it is not a perfect solution. There's always a better way. Lastly, if people come through a quota, they'll probably not succeed. They have not had the same level of competition and they're less likely to thrive in an environment where everyone else is better."

Kinks are random and very personality dependent. Porn just categorised and encashed it. 

At the age when you're still developing, you'll absorb whatever you see. So people are now into to things depending on preexisting content. 
And now everything else seems to be shifting to normalise these kinks. Some stereotyped standard that I'm supposed to achieve that measures the quality of sex I'll have in life."
