I tried everything I could but I couldn't find the button.

TooAfraidToAsk,fj8q9m6,t3_fc1bol,1583119478.0,"I got diagnosed with depression at 8, ADHD at 12 and borderline personality disorder at 16. My family has a history of schizophrenia and based on everything I've read if it happens to me it'll be soon. I already have a really shitty deal with my mental health. I have five siblings none of which show any signs of mental illness.

I'm 20 now and I'm constantly told how I was when I was younger and how everyone I know misses who I used to be. I don't remember who I was before it became a chore to get out of bed. I don't remember being able to go days without wanting to end my life. 

I honestly don't remember what it's like to be truly happy. Sure I have happy moments even happy days. I see so many people my age living their lives and planning for their futures. Anytime I start to think about the future I always ask myself if my depression will get the better of me first. Or if I'll start developing symptoms of schizophrenia. 

I feel like everyone wants the old me. I feel like everyone knows me more than I know myself. I'll tell my mom something that I want to do and she'll tell me the old me wouldn't have done that. She's one of two people that know the extent of my mental illness and what I've done to myself because of it. The only other person who has seen how bad things get is my boyfriend and he didn't meet me until I was 18.

Right now I'm not on my medication because I can't afford it. I'm terrified I'll wake up one day and be even worse than I am now. But if I'm honest I think nothing really scares me more than becoming who I was as a child. Even though I was a lot happier and nicer and actually cares about things. 

Becoming that person again would mean I'd have to accept just how much untreated mental illness changes people and that's more terrifying than anything."

I agree I've seen and heard of shifts who are terrible and i know that I'm very lucky to have great people at my store. 

I think that management coming to expect the best of us once we start giving it to them is pretty standard. Its unfortunate as sometimes I think they forget were people."
starbucks,fizaovi,t1_fiza3r2,1582858129.0,"Because at the end of the day you have a job. I'm don't expect everyone to be perfect but I personally believe that when you have a job you should be doing that job to the best of your ability. People want to complain about wages but doing the bare minimum rarely gets you a raise. 

Of course their going to take advantage of cheaper labor costs. I do think that because it is a job where pretty much everything is trainable that what they pay us is unlikely to change. I know lots of people want to unionize and I agree with that. Wouldn't us all trying even just a little bit more make more of an impact once we do finally unionize?"

starbucks,fiz133l,t1_fiyzjkn,1582851633.0,I'm not saying everyone is. I just see a lot of people who have been acting like just because Corporate isn't paying us the best they dont have the responsibility that they'd have making more at this job.
starbucks,fiz0x3d,t1_fiyzwg4,1582851522.0,"I agree we need to be paid more but try thinking about it this way. This subreddit has people from corporate. They're seeing people talk about how they'll do their jobs when they get paid more. Right now there's probably enough people looking for jobs to replace us at least three times over. 

Why pay us more when you can replace someone(when we have enough and leave) who isn't doing their best because of pay. For someone else who wont do their best because of pay. Things might not be getting done the best but they're getting done cheaper.

I honestly think the best shot we have to start getting paid more is to start doing our jobs as best as we can. People are always talking about unionization. Well if everyone starts doing their best we'll seem happy. Corporate will think were happy. It's the easiest time to unionize."

I'm not saying he didn't 'handle' her or her disorder I wouldn't expect him to. I'm just saying people with bpd are very hard to be with as we're more likely to hurt someone even if it is or isn't intentional. By handling her disorder I mean if you can handle what can happen. I dont think her bpd is an excuse for what she did but i do think i might ir might not have made it more likely to happen. People with bpd are more likely to think about their happiness and what they want before they think about others. If OP didn't want her bpd to be brought up in this he should have never mentioned it.
