bipolar,eyql993,t3_cy8oho,1567346708.0,"You are. The “bad pills” probably not a good idea but I get it. 

So, no matter what we do we’re gonna isolate people in our lives. We’re bipolar right? 

There are going to be days. 

 I am in a just for me day. Drinking whiskey and scrolling Reddit I probably binge a depressing show on Netflix. Thing is (from what I can tell)  we don’t have the balance of giving to people vs personal space so we have to make up for it with extreme days where we close up shop and tell the world to fuck off OR we give our whole selves to the people we love. 

People who don’t have these issues do this instinctively but we have to force it, then we feel bad, then we beat ourselves up for it, then we beat ourselves up for beating ourselves up etc etc etc. 

It’s okay homie. Lock the door. Turn the lights off. Get comfortable. You’ll handle shit tomorrow. 

Just be conscious of the balance between good days and bad. You can allow yourself a day to be sad. But give yourself a day to be happy or at least content. 

But what do I know, I’m crazy 😜 right?"

bipolar,eyee6s3,t3_cwmgv7,1567032535.0,In the thick of it too. Been a few months of it. My gf has been really supportive but I can’t help but feel like it’s slipping away so I get distant and feel like I’m making it worse but is it me? Who knows?
bipolar,evsifac,t1_evsc2j7,1564747366.0,I never tried before my divorce 2 years ago. There was an old painting she left behind I couldn’t stand to look at so I painted over it to see if I could.
bipolar,er21h2c,t3_bzsakr,1560439098.0,"I am recently diagnosed and in a sad phase and realizing for the first time all of the ups and downs of my life and how they make sense with me being bipolar. My SO is a very stable and calm normal girl but my swings can be ... messy at best. Sometimes you got to just let your SO feel whatever they’re feeling. I know when I’m in an episode there are so many things running thru my head that are all jumbled up any more stimulation like having to explain myself makes it worse. But I also want to know she cares. So a simple “hey baby, I love you” helps me in the moment. It’s all really confusing honestly"
