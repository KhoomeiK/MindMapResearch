She said it could be allergies, stress or a combination. I live in Texas and the weather has been really crazy lately as it was around this time last year so I suspect that has a lot to do with it. I take allergy meds everyday though."
raisedbynarcissists,fqhm2jf,t3_gizk46,1589379748.0,"I completely understand. When other people came over, my ngrandma (who raised me) seemed so sweet and caring. It was as if the second they walked out our door she was another person entirely and any claims I made to people made me seem crazy. There were just a few people she had slip ups in front of. One of my best friends was over and she didn’t know we were in my room. She came home from work screaming about probably nothing. My friend was shocked and said she couldn’t have imagined my ngrandma saying the things she did or the way she said them. 

There’s a few good articles out there. I think the one below was pretty helpful, but if you just google PTSD misdiagnosed as BPD, you’ll get some more good reads/case studies.

Then he was super weird about intimacy in Russia and I felt like that it was really creepy to get so upset about her wanting to ease into physical intimacy with a person she just met. Not saying she didn’t have her own motivations, but to withhold something so huge and replace it with something from years ago acting like he changed, that’s raising big red psychopathic flags all over the place. Then his outburst at the restaurant seemed so off. After learning about his actual past/current behaviors it all makes sense. Just so so creepy that someone can act out such an innocent appearance."

raisedbynarcissists,fnxap1h,t1_fnul6a7,1587334827.0,"I’m actually in a great mental state. Still always checking in on my grandparents. Still avoiding my nMom. I can honestly say I never thought I’d have the courage to go NC with her. I was always told I was weak/mousy (by her). And therefore that’s how I viewed myself. I knew it’d have to happen eventually and that it’d happen in a big way. All forms of confrontation with her were like an explosion, so I just stayed really quiet when around her or didn’t address when she was rude/ugly to me. Then, one day she went off on my husband. I knew she would one day, she goes off on everyone eventually. And that’s when I told her everything I’d been holding in for so long. It felt great and scary at the same time. I was so scared she was going to come and hurt me that I couldn’t stop shaking for a few days. Like one long panic attack. I hated having to explain the situation to family members that didn’t know that side of her (though some already did).  But with time and my husbands support, along with this subreddit page (I love knowing my situation isn’t just me-makes me feel less crazy) I’ve gotten through it. I’ve become stronger and I don’t regret my decision for a single moment."
raisedbynarcissists,fnsuvg8,t3_g3ml7w,1587229241.0,"Omg I (29F) can relate to so much of this. I was considered “the quiet kid” at school for years and “too nice.” Truth was, I wasn’t as nice as I was perceived, I was just scared all the time. At home every move I made was commented on. The devil was used to scare me into “behaving” (being submissive). I was slapped in the face when I said something that showed I had my own opinion. 

I’m Mexican-American and so culturally, we usually tend to be Catholics. I went to catholic school till I graduated high school, I went to Sunday school and church in addition to the masses and religion classes I had at school. And for some time I was very involved in church (mostly to meet friends).

I consider myself agnostic now and could never tell my ngrandparents. They would disown me. 
I already went NC with my Nmother about a year and a half ago. So liberating and freeing. I feel like I can be who I want. But it wasn’t easy at first. Mentally I was a mess. Not because I missed her or wondered if I made the right decision, but because I cared too much about what other family members would think. Going to family events has been tough, but I’ve managed and again, happier than I’ve ever been. 

My grandparents are another story (they raised me-my nmother and meth-addicted father did not).
She just came around every now and then and felt she had to knock me down mentally every time because my life seemed better than hers or my upbringing was better. 

I’m afraid of being myself to them. I limit conversations to a few calls a week for just a few minutes, mostly to make sure they’re okay. 
Sometimes I wonder why I care. But then I think of times like these, where people are dying and I feel scared that they disown me and something happens.
But, they’ve become more docile with older age and less contact, so it is a little different. They’re manageable I guess is what I’m saying whereas my nmother was rampant and chaotic.

I’m sorry you have to hide who you are. There’s nothing wrong with you. The only thing wrong is the people who should’ve treated you with love and respect. 
I know with nparents, it’s hard to learn to love yourself after all those years of learning to self- hate. 

As a teenager well into my mid-20’s, I’d considered suicide more times than I can count.
But I was able to start loving myself when i got rid of the main person who caused me to feel that way. It’s so hard to break that train of thought when they’re around to knock it out of you. 

I’m not telling you to go NC, I know it’s hard. I’d just advise to think about what you’d say to someone you loved if you saw them going through this situation. It’s hard to take our own advice, so look at it as though it was a loving friends."

My doc suggested I just take my birth control throughout the month and skip my periods completely. Have had 2 laparoscopies to get rid of the growth.

What bothers me is when someone (like my mother) tries to force it on you or use it to guilt you into doing something they want. Example, my mom told me at a table full of people that I [30F] would go straight to hell for not bearing children -a personal decision I made long ago- because 1.

I’ve accepted it, I just always have that guilty feeling when it comes to my grandma even though she’s just as bad. My therapist has urged me to cut her out but I just can’t. I could never.

GlobalWarming,ezuhlap,t1_ezu9mlo,1568152403.0,"And I can understand that, but again, I feel like with innovative and collaborative thinking, as certain jobs are taken away, other jobs would be created. So if jobs are lost because a company that was destroying the environment is gone, a company that is environmentally friendly will need employees. Or, say that same company chooses to change their methods to accommodate the environment, they can keep their employees. As far as planes and cars, I can’t help but feel like there has to be a cheaper alternative to gas and oil. I’m sure there’s one known, but the industry is so profitable that it’s not even looked at. And that brings me to why this all sounds unobtainable. 
I know these ideas sound naive, but the sad part is they’re only naive because the people who make the decisions related to this, in all parts of the world, are self motivated. Greed is destructive and unfortunately it’s destroying our world literally.
I feel like my saying this makes no significance, but it’s nice to just let it out and have an intelligent conversation with people about it."
raisedbynarcissists,eza7ape,t3_d0g5od,1567796091.0,"I also told my mother I was just DONE about 7 months ago. She just text my husband last week (since I blocked her number) apologizing for her “demons” and no “harsh feelings on her side” lol we didn’t bother to respond. It’s like, after 6 months of not hearing from us I guess she finally figured out that I was serious when I said I’d never speak to her again. 
During this whole period she’s spread lies about us to other family members. They’re always sorry when they have to deal with consequences but as soon as you forgive them they go right back at it. I just can’t do it to myself or my husband anymore. It’s hard to cut a parent out of your life, I had to do it with my meth addicted father when I was just 13. And I’m not sorry for cutting either of them out. My life is so much happier, less stressful and that’s how it should be. 
We should surround ourselves with people who bring joy to our lives and who want to be a positive piece of it. Life’s too short to surround yourself with people who are only in it for themselves and who are 100% okay with hurting you over and over. 
Maybe they don’t mean to be that way and that’s what I’ve struggled with, wondering if she just can’t help it. But my uncle told me this, when you’re mean to someone and hurt them, you know what you’re doing and what feelings you’re causing. They know they’re being hurtful, they just feel like we should suck it up and forget about it. 
It’s hard because you don’t choose who your family is and because of that you’re more forgiving than you would be a friend, but after so many chances you have to say I’m done."

It asks which park you’re in, then you select which ride you’re on and gives you clues where to find the hidden Mickey! It was $8, but I really enjoyed it!

For my husband and I, we’ve been going every few years since we started dating and it’s just kinda our thing. It makes us feel closer and just happy. We turn into little kids when we go. We usually have only done 2 day hoppers but this year, since we’ve matured more in our careers and have been able to save more money we thought we’d give 4 days a try! So we did a4 day hopper and we went pretty hard at rides our first 2 days. Knowing we had 4 days made it easier for us to decide to go back to our hotel for a midday nap. Then on our 3rd day we did repeat some rides and took a little longer of a break and our 4th day was mostly us just soaking up the park. We did everything we wanted to so we kinda just walked around, ate, did a few more rides but that day really was just to be there."

I always remember the looks she gave me were always of annoyance. 3 yrs later she had my sister with another guy. They were and still are inseparable. When she’d come visit (not me, more to ask my Grandma for money) she’d play with my sister, hug her and call her her honey bunny. It never bothered me bc I didn’t consider her my mom, it was just awkward and I always just wanted her to leave.

I always wish there was a way I could like win a bunch of money so I didn’t have to work because I’m not good at anything. I hate the feeling and always try to do things to prove it’s not true. Then I make a mistKe and it’s like everything I’ve done right doesn’t matter."
Marriage,epzmkuj,t3_bwocil,1559668578.0,"My husband is in your same situation. We’ve been together for 7 years and married 2. He’s always known my family is crazy. I was raised by my grandparents who, while loving and giving, are not all there. My dad has schizophrenia and is a meth addict and my mom is a narcissistic manipulative terrible human being. After years of allowing her to put me down and never standing up for myself, I finally did this January when she started verbally attacking him. I’ve contemplated cutting her out of my life for years and was scared to do it bc my family is so large and was afraid of the strain it would cause. Not to mention, I was just scared. Scared of her. But I did it. And it’s been tough but my mental health has flourished because of it and I’m so happy I did it. If you need to private message me feel free! I know it helps to talk these things out with people who understand through personal experience."
