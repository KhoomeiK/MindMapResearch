depression,fnpcw4k,t3_g2xeu4,1587143288.0,Yeah I feel like I have not been proactive enough in my life as well. I always feel jealous/envious at other people's accomplishments but it's hard for me to get stuff done on my own.
depression,fnpcphq,t3_g2ojjp,1587143195.0,Your dad sounds like a terrible person. Don't let what he says get to you.

depression,fm2uknp,t3_fqdzmh,1585705759.0,Nah I'm more depressed during afternoons.
depression,fm2u7pn,t3_fsltfo,1585705528.0,"It's not selfish to think that. I feel the same way. However, the quarantine is necessary to protect us and our loved ones from the virus."

depression,fm2tjta,t3_fsg8zk,1585705100.0,That's so terrible... :( I just got a pet and it scares me to hear this. I'm sorry for your loss.

depression,fkenjpm,t3_fhqbbh,1584116858.0,That's so terrible :( I'm sorry for your loss
depression,fk62r8m,t3_ff6w7x,1583892523.0,"I have good moods more often, but I just think it's frustrating how I can just wake up the next day and everything that happened yesterday suddenly seems like a distant dream; if the next day is shitty, I'll feel shitty that day regardless of how yesterday was. I wish there was some more consistency between days."
depression,fk626z4,t3_fdgxip,1583892213.0,"Yes, definitely. All the time I tell myself I'm disgusting, a fucking worthless piece of shit, etc. It's internalized itself in a lot of my thought processes."
depression,fk61x6i,t3_fduqan,1583892061.0,Sometimes I want to sleep really badly. My apt is a little claustrophobic though so I feel trapped after a while in my room
depression,fk61qwu,t3_fg52jk,1583891964.0,"Awesome dude! I'm glad you enjoyed yourself. Yeah same, fuck tests."
depression,fk61nil,t3_fekv9y,1583891912.0,Yeah I hate interview questions like that honestly. Generic as fuck and you always have to come up with some bullshitty response to them that's irrelevant to your actual qualifications for the job.
depression,fk60zs0,t3_fdnzub,1583891558.0,"Same this happens to me especially when there's a super important event tmrw like a final exam, I tell myself I have to go to sleep but I can't stop thinking about it so I end up staying up until 1pm :/"
depression,fjeme1k,t3_fb0cst,1583274314.0,"Yep thats super un fucking helpful lol, sorry you have to listen to that. People don't really know how to give helpful advice though if they haven't been through it."
depression,fjem81r,t3_farc3n,1583274217.0,"I felt like that for a while and some days I gravitate closer towards that, but generally I have motivation to live nowadays"
depression,fjbjywo,t3_fcis7e,1583194991.0,"True. After a while the ones you do enjoy start to feel bland, as well."
depression,fjbju25,t3_fcbdvk,1583194902.0,"That's terrible, I'm so sorry you are being treated that way."
depression,fiyla1v,t3_faifig,1582841628.0,"\*some people. There are good people out there, trust. We just remember the bad ones more vividly"
depression,fiyl5oj,t3_fadk7h,1582841557.0,"I know how you feel. I often feel alone on campus too, yet I'm surrounded by so many others. I also feel like I'm wasting a ton of opportunity while other people are out there being more productive or doing things. Life isn't a race though"
depression,fiykw09,t3_fae3zq,1582841397.0,"Don't worry it's probably affecting you more than it's affecting her. Just focus on yourself. It's ok if you write the same things as others sometimes, it's not always possible to think of something different."
depression,fiyi26z,t3_fagtn3,1582839818.0,How I try to empathize with others as much as possible
depression,fiyhh4o,t3_facidp,1582839498.0,Man I wish my parents would have let me keep a pet when I lived with them. But yeah it helps me too
depression,fiyhca5,t3_fa7osq,1582839424.0,Happy birthday

depression,fi4pb0q,t3_f5zfvl,1582145757.0,I know right. I felt like that so much at my old school
depression,fi4p0d6,t3_f6dnm6,1582145592.0,That's really terrible... I'm so sorry for your loss. I hope it was not the case that the hospital released her when she was still showing suicidal signs.
depression,fi11svg,t3_f5qwu3,1582048946.0,"My brain doesn't even process it when people ask these question (unless it's someone particularly close), I just smile and say ""Great, how about you."" I would not want to dump my problems on people I barely know anyway."
depression,fi11kc8,t3_f5si2a,1582048824.0,"I don't have romantic experience, but I would suggest being patient if you see him starting to go into this phase again. Don't take everything he says to heart, and gently let him know that you're there for him in case he wants to talk about his depressive feelings to you (don't be overly pushy though)."
depression,fi116p8,t3_f5m1lr,1582048622.0,"Me. I tried interviewing for a clerk position at a Stop&Shop once and I was shook as hell going in because it was my first ever job interview. I didn't prep for any of the questions they might ask me and halfway through the manager said I ""seemed pretty quiet"" which threw me even more off balance. Did not get the job lol, and up until very recently I've been apprehensive of even thinking about it"
depression,fi10wz3,t3_f5l8j4,1582048478.0,Good for you! I'm proud of you.
depression,fi10v1r,t3_f5sjgn,1582048451.0,That does sound like depression. It's not the same thing as sadness.
depression,fi10rri,t3_f5tky1,1582048404.0,I read your note; please don't kill yourself.
depression,fi0zlnq,t3_f5r2jg,1582047791.0,"Yes, please bring this up with the doctor. I'm no medical expert but it sounds like you have schizophrenia."
depression,fi0zf4g,t3_f5qtlj,1582047699.0,Yup. A lot of people don't understand depression well because they haven't experienced it.
depression,fi0zcko,t3_f5cc8g,1582047664.0,"That's true for me too, a large part of what's driving me forward are these goals I've set for myself but I feel like they'll take forever to achieve."
depression,fi0z1yd,t3_f5nbbz,1582047508.0,Well that kind of self-image sounds like depression to me.
depression,fi0yzgh,t1_fi0uc8w,1582047471.0,How about both?
depression,fhzm7vt,t3_f5exnm,1582003556.0,"That's really terrible of her... I'm sorry you have to go through this. Please don't kill yourself though, you still have your whole life ahead of you."
depression,fhzly5x,t3_f5kmc2,1582003314.0,"Happy birthday. It's not ""petty and small,"" don't devalue your importance."
depression,fhzlsza,t3_f5c12v,1582003186.0,Yes. I realized a while back that my pain is my own; there's too much going through my head for anyone else to ever fully comprehend what's in there.
depression,fhrdgi1,t3_f4egz8,1581823484.0,I'm so fucking proud of you!
depression,fhjff6e,t3_f34bbi,1581644861.0,"You're kind of right, if you don't want to exist then there's no point. But if you think some time down the road you might change your mind and start wanting to live again, then future you is going to be pretty mad at yourself for not doing it."
depression,fhjf8j2,t3_f3cme2,1581644730.0,Good luck! Try to be honest.
depression,fh1n076,t3_f0xna8,1581218509.0,"I have felt this way a bit too, it's so much easier to decipher and side for/against anime characters because usually they are clearly portrayed as good/bad. Whereas things can be pretty complicated in real life."
depression,fh1mqw6,t3_f0vw9r,1581218391.0,That's not a bad idea. I have found social media to be pretty drowning too.
depression,fgr0rgt,t3_ezl0gy,1581035609.0,Good on you for making the effort to call your doctor; I pray that they'll be able to give you some solace.
depression,fgr0irr,t3_f006ey,1581035461.0,"Those people don't have depression, so it's hard for them to empathize with us."
depression,fgr0fwj,t3_ezuylj,1581035415.0,"Tell her that, on the contrary, she has every right to be sad if her family members have died; they don't have to go through the loss and suffering of being separated from their loved ones. Tell her that you care about her (if this is true) and she is free to come and talk with you, although you shouldn't get too pushy about this. Good luck."
depression,fgqzvwq,t3_ezmua4,1581035078.0,"I'm super good at disguising my anxiety and depression. I could be feeling frightened as a child and/or telling myself that I'm a worthless piece of shit on the inside, and give absolutely no indicator of this on the outside. Some people don't understand depression isn't always something you can see."
depression,fgqzm4r,t1_fgojj1r,1581034909.0,Your therapist was full of shit
depression,fgqzilw,t3_ezq38p,1581034846.0,I'm so proud of you for having the courage to stay alive!
depression,fgooy6c,t3_ezkpd4,1580979345.0,Good on you for getting back on your feet! I'm proud of you.
depression,fgootyx,t3_ezk1g9,1580979173.0,"Good on you for wanting to see a therapist! I haven't gotten around to seeing one myself, but I hope that you will be able to sit down with one and that they will give you some solace."
depression,fgoop69,t3_ezllo1,1580978979.0,"I would get this feeling sometimes after watching one of those space documentaries where they would start with Earth and zoom out until they reached the edge of the observable universe, and the zooming out would take >5 minutes or so. I figure though, I don't really care about what I can't see or stuff that's out of my control. I've never seen space with my own eyes, so it might as well not exist. I live life for myself, and I'm content with just the stuff I experience, even if it's insignificant compared to whatever's out there."
depression,fgoocpn,t3_ezex1l,1580978493.0,"God, I feel the same way. I don't even fucking have a job though. I got rejected from a position as a grocery store worker LOL, I cracked up during the job interview because it was my first and the manager looked at me funny. I feel like such a worthless piece of shit."
depression,fgoo5j1,t1_fgnjxw8,1580978210.0,"I know this may not be what you want to hear, but random people are not obligated to do things like invite you to parties out of sympathy, even if they were your friends. Besides, maybe getting invited wouldn't even make you happy in the end: you might just sulk and think, ""well, they're just inviting me out of sympathy.""

I don't think it's likely that people will *come* to you; if you want to fix your loneliness, then *you* have to take a proactive approach because it's *your* loneliness and *you're* the one who ultimately cares about it. Have you tried asking *them* if you could join in on one of their parties?

Sorry if my tone sounded patronizing in this post; I'm just trying to share some advice, not disparage you in any way."
depression,fgonqaq,t3_ezntk1,1580977626.0,"Me too. Thankfully I am starting to find a couple of online friends after I joined a gaming community. Even so, for me it feels like people are very hit-or-miss: they're either close friends or total strangers, no in-betweens. I often feel jealous of people in the community who can socialize effortlessly and amass followers like they're candy."
depression,fgona8g,t3_ezh6h2,1580977021.0,"I hug my stuffed penguin a lot :) Makes me feel a little less lonely. I wish my parents would have let me own a pet when I was a kid, though."
depression,fgon5kl,t3_eznyxr,1580976844.0,"Yep, I feel like a melodramatic attention whore pretty often when I'm depressed too. I hate the thought of discussing my feelings with other people because they sound so stupid when I try to articulate them, which is part of the reason why I haven't tried seeing a therapist."
depression,fgomz8o,t3_ezbcno,1580976607.0,"I wouldn't say they *hate* sad people-- just that they feel uncomfortable around them, and unless they're compassionate beings they tend to avoid them because they don't bring them any benefit."
depression,fg0g6om,t3_euni91,1580407127.0,Me too! I did this all the time in high school. Even now my sleep schedule is still fucked.
depression,fftlrtu,t3_euze1e,1580223807.0,"I feel like that a little sometimes too-- without some sort of drama or depression in the background, it's just... boring for me, I suppose. I would recommend taking up some sort of hobby to hopefully fill the void.

I'm glad the medication is working for you, and I hope you find peace."
depression,fftliba,t3_ev1atk,1580223621.0,That sucks. Sorry man.
depression,fftla5n,t3_ev3mw2,1580223461.0,"Sure! Make sure to take it one step at a time though. If you find you can't stick to yourself 100%, that's OK, maybe try adjusting it to be a little more lenient. Any progress is progress."
depression,fftl3l1,t3_ev3e54,1580223333.0,"I can relate, I also used to be a bit of a nasty person who would constantly point out other people's flaws in order to draw my attention away from myself. I stopped when I realized it wasn't giving me any happiness (only deepening my jealousy/spitefulness) and started working on improving my own shortcomings. I'm glad you've become self-aware about this, it's an important first step."
depression,fftk5iz,t3_euyoij,1580222660.0,This is how I feel a lot of times too
depression,fftjz59,t3_ev2ttv,1580222532.0,I'm sorry for your loss.
depression,fftjw75,t3_euni91,1580222473.0,"This is me so much. Instead of sleeping early I stay up late the day before stressful events like final exams because I want to delay them as much as possible, only to be groggy the next morning and not perform as well as I could have."
Anxiety,fftjmh2,t3_ev19v9,1580222275.0,"This happens to me too. It's difficult to overcome procrastination, but I find it helps sometimes to just try and think of one assignment at a time, and give yourself frequent breaks in between assignments. Listening to music while doing them also helps take some edge off."
Anxiety,fftj7bi,t3_ev4jct,1580221961.0,I also find crying helpful to release my emotions. There's a lot of shit bottled up in there and it's healthy to let it out frequently so it doesn't build up.
Anxiety,fftj34i,t3_ev0ulp,1580221874.0,"That's awesome, I'm glad for you :)"
Anxiety,fftiwro,t3_euub8p,1580221744.0,Good on you!
depression,ffpo95r,t3_eufm9r,1580100164.0,I do this a little from time to time. Helps me keep my sanity since it can be days in between having a conversation with another irl human being.
depression,ffpo5vz,t3_eu5mom,1580100087.0,"Me too, I call myself nasty things and constantly point out my flaws to myself all the time. On the bright side, I think it helps me vent my emotions a little so I'm always very pleasant to other people."
depression,ffpnz0g,t3_eudsju,1580099930.0,"Sounds like you have a supportive friend group. I think you could be misinterpeting-- when she said that you shouldn't be sad, she probably meant ""be sad"" in the sense of ""feel sad"" and not ""act sad"", ie. ""I don't want you to feel sad, I want you to feel happy"" and not ""I don't want you to act sad / express your sadness around me""."
depression,ffpn1af,t3_eu9td1,1580099170.0,"Happy birthday. I'm sorry you had to spend it alone, I hope you are able to find happiness in the future."
depression,ffh0z54,t3_etkvgj,1579920195.0,"That's tough... were you guys just teasing each other, or was your friend aware that they were hurting your feelings? If so, I would not want to continue being around such a person."
depression,ffh0mcm,t3_et6dc3,1579919921.0,"Me too, I regularly refer to myself as a lazy piece of shit and I tend to be very unproductive/have very poor time management skills."

depression,ffh0ftn,t3_etk40u,1579919784.0,"Not that I have any experience with dating at all, but... maybe you should be direct and ask him why he doesn't want to talk anymore? Just to get some closure."
depression,ffh04sl,t3_etep5d,1579919553.0,I love sleeping a lot too... I wish I could just sleep through some days uninterrupted honestly.
