cats,fm7bij9,t1_fm6yr89,1585820561.0,"My fiancÃ© did for a while as well, but I think he got tired of me asking haha."
cats,fm7bh5f,t1_fm6uq3b,1585820518.0,Very nice! :)
cats,fm7besb,t1_fm6r0pv,1585820442.0,"Weâ€™re honestly not entirely sure. We adopted her back in December, I believe her paperwork actually said she was blue tortie if I remember correctly."
cats,fm7bb02,t1_fm6pyqc,1585820321.0,"A little uncertain at first, like with most new things. They became more curious about their surroundings than worried about being in the stroller once we walked outside."

This is it!"
cats,fm7a0pq,t1_fm75ipn,1585818865.0,"Both of these cats are inside cats who enjoy going outside. I just want to let them be able to go further than the backyard in the safest way possible. They also have harnesses as well, but thatâ€™s not something I would use outside of the fenced in backyard for safety reasons. Obviously if I sense that they are unhappy, I will stop putting them in it."
cats,fm79pmi,t1_fm6pbcp,1585818513.0,"To each their own opinion, I just know in my case my cats enjoy going outside and Iâ€™d like for them to be able to do so in the safest way I possibly can."
cats,fm79msg,t1_fm71d4q,1585818422.0,"Theyâ€™re indoor cats, they just both enjoy going outdoors every once in a while!"
cats,fm79lpm,t1_fm6tftg,1585818388.0,I didnâ€™t take the plastic that it came with in the box off yet when the picture was taken.

cats,fm62jex,t1_fm628qi,1585784927.0,Thatâ€™s so cute! :) I really hope mine get to that point as well!
cats,fm61xx4,t1_fm61pz5,1585784573.0,That sounds like a great plan haha. I ordered it off of Amazon. :)
cats,fm5ybpq,t1_fm5xouw,1585782453.0,Yes I do. :)
cats,fm5y78l,t1_fm5tiby,1585782381.0,"Oh wow, that sounds pretty rough. :( I hope you find something that works out for her! The orange cat is an absolute pain when I try to put him in his cat carrier too. He likes to run and hide, so I was fairly surprised he let me put him in the stroller so easily!"
cats,fm5mu7g,t1_fm5kbi9,1585775924.0,"My cats are inside cats as well and love the outside. I always feel a little sad when we leave them to take our pup for a walk, so now they can tag along haha. Iâ€™m glad your cats enjoy it too. :)"
cats,fm5hsoh,t1_fm5eaa0,1585773211.0,"I havenâ€™t gotten a chance to walk them out of the driveway with it yet, but so far so good haha."

birthcontrol,euxsg5t,t1_euxn64x,1564091190.0,"Thank you for reading and giving advice! My only reason for not taking them yet was to see if the birth control was actually causing the problems, but if I donâ€™t start seeing any improvement soon thatâ€™ll be my next step."
