MorbidReality,eo6e5he,t1_enzb0v5,1558317986.0,"I mean, the adults were usually people down on their luck who genuinely wanted to change the world - which is what Jim Jones convinced them they would be doing. Jones was an amazing speaker and used a lot of tactics to convince people he was a game-changer.

The population at Jonestown consisted of mainly women (single moms), African Americans, freed criminals, young runaways, drug addicts/ alcoholics, the elderly, and children. Basically, all people who would struggle to survive on their own or weren't accepted by society. 

Jim promised if they gave him their pay checks/welfare checks/ disability checks etc. he would provide them with ""everything they needed.""

Essentially, without knowing they signed up for what turned into a work camp."
