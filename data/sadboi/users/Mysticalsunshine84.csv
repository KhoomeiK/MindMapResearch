Odsp,fr54luh,t1_fr4fy97,1589902407.0,"Actually you are not correct “a_dumb_noob2”. There are people who do qualify who work part time or full time. However EI right now is approving everybody who applies and you automatically get a $2000 payment. Part of your responsibility as a ODSP recipient is that you apply for EI if you quit or lose a job as if you are eligible they want you to be receiving money from the right agency. However, ODSP workers are telling recipients right now (if you had a job at all) to apply for EI benefits (if you do an income report and don’t provide income when you had a job. So I was told on Thursday to apply for EI benefits by the ODSP worker who called to check on why I didn’t report income. I didn’t report income as I quit my job in Feb 2020 due to my health. Well the worker told me that regardless I had to apply for EI benefits as it is my responsibility. So guess what I was automatically approved for CERB even though I don’t qualify. I answered the questions 100% truthfully when I applied for EI Benefits when I was was told to by the ODSP worker but right now because you are automatically approved and put on CERB (which I verified with an EI agent this morning) I now will be getting a $2000 payment which I don’t qualify for. That I will owe the CRA back for next year at tax time. So I called the CRA this morning and thankfully they gave me instructions to pay it back so I don’t owe it next year however even this morning when I called ODSP (my local office) my worker gave me the run around and then told me to contact someone else in the office so I did and sure enough they sat there and said “it’s your responsibility to apply for this as you were working and now aren’t.” Even though EI said no they are wrong. So long story short don’t apply for EI even when ODSP workers tell you to as right now it is NOT THE REGULAR EI process."
Odsp,fr53fgi,t1_fr2afl6,1589901807.0,ODSP has to do with it if they have told you to apply if you have quit a job due to your health. DO NOT APPLY FOR CERB AT ALL EVEN IF ODSP TELLS YOU IT IS “YOUR RESPONSIBILITY”. I will be posting my experience with this in a post as soon as I have it all written out as I am now putting in a complaint to the Ombudsman of Ontario due to ODSP’s complete and utter disregard and lack of caring about the recipients and their wellbeing.

Odsp,fqzi4wt,t1_fqzhvr2,1589767877.0,Again there are further incentives after 6 months and a year it is in the best interest of the employer to keep the employee employed. Also anyone can be fired within a 3 month probationary period some employers do a 6 month probationary period. But honestly even after the 6 months or at anytime a employer can fire you “without cause”. Even if you are over your probationary period.
Odsp,fqzh7wz,t1_fqzh447,1589767317.0,It would depend so sometimes the incentive or wage subsidy was for 4-6 weeks and then the longer the employee was employed they got other incentives like at 6 months and a year.
Odsp,fqzgj05,t1_fqz1xas,1589766897.0,"If that is the case, if people experience that they need to contact the Human Rights Commission. No company who went through the service centre I worked for did that in the span of the 2 yrs I was working there. It doesn’t make it okay to pay people who are disabled less....they can’t pay less than minimum wage and when the incentive is done they have to keep the same rate of pay."
Odsp,fqws7k7,t1_fqw7zng,1589715871.0,You are 100% right you can’t force anyone to hire anyone. However there are some very attractive incentives through Employment Ontario service centres for employers wishing to hire anyone with a disability. Which include wage subsidy for a period of time and also incentives after the period should they retain the employee also training incentives should the candidate need to be trained. The issue is that it’s not widely advertised. I know because I used to work for an Employment Ontario Service Centre (a popular one).
Odsp,fqr965d,t1_fqr87cl,1589579929.0,"I don’t understand your reasoning that the cost wouldn’t decrease if people aren’t using the food bank or as many obviously they wouldn’t need to purchase as much food thus a savings. Most people who use the food bank are on Social Assistance so obviously if the government increased the payments then not as many people on social assistance would be using the food bank so it would be mainly seniors and maybe families with more mouths to feed. 

So they would save. The funding would go further."
Odsp,fqr5shi,t1_fqr5aj4,1589578125.0,"I’m not saying they need to cut any funding so I can “get more” I’m saying in the long run they are going to save money as people won’t be accessing the services as much or at all. Yes I agree they are not spending enough money on Social Assistance.

Also it’s only logical even if the Food Banks get bulk discounts if less people are using the services they wouldn’t be ordering as much correct? 

So they would save money."
Odsp,fqr46wc,t1_fqr2owk,1589577270.0,"Yes they would be saving money especially at food banks. As if we received a payment that was enough to actually live off of not only would the Food Bank usage go down, but also OHIP wouldn’t have to cover as much health wise for us as we could eat more healthy! So it may cost more but in the long run the government would save. As there wouldn’t be as many people using the Foodbank resources or being as sick as you could afford to eat healthy at that point instead of shopping for pasta, mac n cheese and all the other wonderful processed food that we on Social Assistance can only afford. I do eat pretty healthy (fruits, veggies and whole grain.) but I do still have to sacrifice some stuff to be able to afford that healthier food. Which is also why I work part time most of the time, so that I can afford those “luxuries”. 

But right now I can’t work due to my illness so $957 is what I get for my monthly payment. It’s so awesome when my rent is $625 trying to live for the month.... 

Oh and yes I would be happy with $400 extra a month even if it was limited to certain places like if they gave so much in grocery store gift cards etc. 

I am tired of not having money for food or necessities that I need. Especially right now when I am struggling with my illness. Half the time I can’t even afford Extra Strength Tylenol lol....once I am done paying rent and bills."
Odsp,fqr3gm7,t3_gkddna,1589576879.0,"Yeah Ford doesn’t care about anyone on ODSP or OW. He looks at it that there are so many jobs available so people no matter what should be able to do them. 

Maybe if that is his stance he needs to actually give more funding to Employment Ontario job centres so they can help with job creation and working with employers so that they will hire people who have medical issues and are disabled. Like it’s a huge joke. So if Ford wants to get people into the workforce maybe also offer more for training/schooling opportunities. Not everyone on ODSP is also able to work, in the article I read yes he does say “able-bodied - mind and body”.
But that doesn’t change the fact that depending on the area you live in, there aren’t always jobs available. I am on ODSP and work part time normally, but I had to quit due to my illness. The government needs to realize that employers need to also be alerted that disabled people would love to work should they offer better accommodations and if the government offered a subsidy for however long (which there are incentives for a period of time, if the employer goes through a Service centre for Employment Ontario)."
Odsp,fqr1tim,t1_fqr062x,1589576016.0,"Yes it would be millions however if we were getting payments that allowed us to live, then we wouldn’t be using other services or programs that they “budget” for. So honestly if they raised our payments then they would be saving in other areas as we would have the money to live, or not rely on some of the programs funded by the government."

Odsp,fpa3r4f,t1_fpa1a33,1588440205.0,"No actually I stopped the support and went fully off it. When I had my medical review in May I was deemed that I still meet the definition of a disability and I don’t have any further review dates that is after my first review by the way. No ODSP is not permanent if you are able to work again. So please stop being ridiculous. ODSP should be looked at with the same views as EI sick benefits. If you need them, then it is because you are sick and even at 55% of my wage I was making $1000 more a month than I am making now! So obviously that says something. How am I being entitled? Please tell me! I would love to hear that! I am asking for a bit more money per month to survive while I try to get better enough to work again. How is that being entitled? Lol. I’m not asking for $2500/month even. I would like $2000/month which is the same that they are giving for the CERB. The amount our very own government came up with that an individual needs to survive. I’m asking for the same. If I need more than $2000/month the. Yes I would definitely need to work for it. I do again NORMALLY WORK. But why should I be punished or anyone else for that matter on ODSP, when they are sick trying to survive and not being able to work at the moment? I couldn’t go on sick leave I was out of EI sick benefits and they wouldn’t let me do regular benefits as I was “not ready and able” to work at this time. To me it makes it wrong and horrible that the government expects people who are legitimately sick (people on ODSP and CPP-D and even OW waiting to be approved for ODSP) to suffer and struggle month to month. I am NOT ACTING ENTITLED. If I was asking for $2500-$4000/ month that would be scratching the edge of being classified entitled. My boyfriend is on CPP-D he tried for over 3 yrs after having a stroke 5 yrs ago, but was discriminated against because he has cognitive issues. He went through so many jobs before finally finding an amazing employer who is 100% understanding. Why should he suffer because people were jerks and wouldn’t give him a fair chance? So he was left to make $1075/month work for years and he didn’t have benefits so was paying $200+ a month in prescriptions. How is that even fair? It’s not. At all. Thankfully now
he now does get ODB being on my benefit unit. So between the two of us...we make $2056/month with rent being $1250....$806 left to pay for everything else. So basically I’m lucky to have $100 left for food for the month so I usually don’t have laundry money....thankfully I can do it at my parents but it’s pretty sad when I don’t have enough for food, laundry.....But the government says oh $2000/person is needed for “regular working people” let’s forget about the extra medical supplies and medications needed for someone who is disabled. Let’s give them nothing to live off of because even with BASIC NECESSITIES $957/month doesn’t cover that. Lol I live in a small town and have a cheaper place to rent as they are now asking for as high as $1600 for a one bedroom. Oh and anywhere from $750-$800 for a ROOM! 

If you believe these are livable “benefits” we are getting you should definitely be making a living as an accountant/financial consultant then you wouldn’t need the “BENEFIT” that us on ODSP get per month. Just because this “BENEFIT” works for you, just shows you are privileged and live with family or friends where you have pretty much your whole “BENEFIT” to carry you through the month if you can make $1000/month stretch to survive in a regular situation where you have to pay full price for rent etc then god please sign me up, offer seminars on how you survive. Don’t you dare ever call me entitled or privileged, because if you are making it by on $1000/month you are the privileged one here not me."
Odsp,fpa0d3z,t1_fpa07y1,1588438264.0,"Lmao. Who’s not answering questions now? ODSP has also been temporary for me as well. I was off for 3 yrs in between before having to have it reinstated. So you are wrong, end of story. Also if you are sick obviously it’s hard to hold a job to make more than $957/month.

It’s sad that there are people like you who believe we are getting enough to live off of. Unbelievable. I would gladly be working right now if I was able."
Odsp,fpa018y,t1_fp9yr2a,1588438073.0,"I have explained why, I myself and anyone else on ODSP deserve more. I need more than $957/month to survive. $957/month is NOT A LIVABLE INCOME. I am not being greedy at all. I have paid my taxes and continue to do so every year that I work, even part time. I didn’t call it a paycheque. The government has set a precedence by offering the CERB and setting it at $2000/person per month. That isn’t income it’s also a BENEFIT those people aren’t getting paid for working at this moment, EVEN IF ITS TAXED next year it’s still not “earned wage”. So I guess people on sick leave from work taking EI benefits don’t deserve that cause it’s a BENEFIT. 

It is people like you who act like we are getting enough per month to survive that perpetuate the cycle of month to month poverty by not standing up and talking about the injustice. Good for you that you can survive on $957-$1169/ month if you are a single recipient. You are obviously renting a room in a smaller community or living with family or friends that don’t charge you anywhere near what the normal rate for rent is. I also have medication to pay for that ODB DOESN’T COVER that I have to have because I can’t function without it. So I am paying out in a month more than I receive. Thankfully my boyfriend pays for my medication. It is not greed, this is necessity. The rates we get “given” to us are NOT enough to even get by. Nobody is asking for $4000/month like seriously. But the government has set that $2000/month is what is needed to get by. I want $2000/month as I am also a citizen of Canada and I want to not struggle in my sickness to be able to afford food and needed medication. I’m not asking to live even comfortably, I just want to get by so how is that greed? It’s not."
Odsp,fp9xt16,t1_fp9xizt,1588436777.0,"It doesn’t matter. We also deserve a livable “guaranteed income” and also I do usually work part time. Right now my illness is too bad for me to hold a job. I am working on changing medications. So yes I normally do “make money” so now I have to stress as I have $957 per month while I am SICKER than I have been for a long time. How is that fair? I didn’t ask to suffer from this illness. So because I’m sick and I’m not out “making money” I guess I don’t deserve a livable income. Makes so much sense to me. Let’s make those who are sick stress out more and not be able to survive month to month. It’s not fair. I even got OFF ODSP and was working full time again, for almost 3 yrs. But due to the nature of my illness, I can’t work at all right now. So even though I have worked full time for most of my life and held a job for MOST OF MY LIFE, I guess I deserve to be treated like a waste of space and drain on the system because I’m not out working “earning money”. Makes 100% sense. Why be privileged enough to pay my rent, bills and groceries. Stupid me I guess. You know cause I asked to have this illness!"

I am having the same issue. I have some type of infection and called our town’s only clinic that is operating right now. They said “We don’t accept ODSP benefits, but we can still see you if you pay for the appointment. 

Which obviously I can’t because if I could I wouldn’t be on ODSP....but I did manage to leave a message for my amazing regular dentist who got back to me after checking their messages and even though they are not open, they are doing emergency appointments for their patients.

It’s not like I was just calling for a cleaning, or calling when we aren’t in the middle of a pandemic. If they choose to stay open, and knowing they are the ONLY OFFICE open for emergency appointments....they should be taking everyone. On a normal day when the pandemic wasn’t happening if I called there and they said that, yeah I would have been upset, however I wouldn’t have gone to the point of writing a vent post. But because this is an emergency and they are the only office open for emergencies....they should take ODSP Dental Benefits. It’s just BAD business practice to stay open saying you are an emergency clinic and then tell someone on social assistance “We can see you but you have to pay...” if I had the extra $200-$300 to pay I wouldn’t be on social assistance and wouldn’t be upset paying it. The fact of the matter is 1. The way the receptionist acted and 2. The fact that they know they are the only clinic open and can’t accommodate anyone makes it unbelievably rude.

So today, I was once again reminded that I as a disabled person on ODSP don’t matter. 

I had a abscess on my gums above a tooth, which I have never, ever had before. My regular dentist’s office is closed, so I had to call my family doctor. I sent her a pic of the abscess and she prescribed Amoxicillin for 10 days. Here it is almost 2 weeks later and my mouth is once again in excruciating pain. I now have a huge bump on the inside of my gums under my tongue. It’s so sore. So I called my doctor once again because my dentist is not open. She said there is unfortunately nothing she can do and that she knows there is one dental clinic in town that is doing emergency appointments. She urged me to call them. So I call and leave a message and they call me back about 20 min later. I explain the situation, she said no problem we can make you an appointment! “I said great, I just want to let you know I’m on ODSP Dental benefits.” Immediately she says “We don’t accept ODSP Dental Benefits, so we can see you but you have to pay for the visit.”
So I said “But my regular dentist isn’t open (who does accept my benefits) and my Family Doctor referred me to you.” She repeats “We don’t accept ODSP Dental Benefits, if you have the money to pay for the appointment we can see you.” So I said “Okay thank you. I guess I’ll just leave it and deal with the pain.”  She was like “Okay”. 

So once again I am reminded that I am nothing because I’m on social assistance and I don’t deserve to be seen even though this is a semi-emergency. 

I’m so angry, hurt and embarrassed.

Someone on Reddit sent me a link for COVID-19 emergency dental clinics and low and behold the ONLY one in my town (Orillia) is the one listed, is the exact same one that denied me today unless I was able to pay for the appointment.  Westridge Family Dentistry.... 

I make $1100 or less a month on ODSP. I had to literally write an email threatening to go to government officials to get the Emergency Discretionary Benefit....from ODSP....I had to email my caseworker’s manager to get an answer and low and behold today it came in after me having to call and then email my caseworker and when I didn’t hear back I then emailed her manager threatening to go to Government. Like I don’t want to have to fight to get a little bit of help. The Emergency Discretionary Benefit ODSP is offering Is a ONE TIME ONLY BENEFIT.....this pandemic is ongoing....I have had to spend more money on groceries due to not being
able to get bare necessities at the stores I usually shop at.....I am forced to go to the more expensive grocery stores which takes money ways from other things it was to be allocated to....The government has now set a standard that it costs at least $2000 to get by right? Well try being on ODSP where you are too sick to work, you are medically approved to be on ODSP and you make $1100. My rent is $1250....I am lucky I have a boyfriend to split the rent with.....but it leaves no money for anything else... my boyfriend is on CPP Disability due to having a stroke 5 yrs ago, and his CPP is deducted off my ODSP. So I end up with about $1000 or less a month....yet the CERB is giving people $2000 per person? Yes I did get an increase in my GST....but that was a one time payment. 

Society has this stigma and stereotype of people on social assistance whether it be ODSP or Ontario Works....that we are living the high life with tons of money, drinking and doing drugs....I can’t even afford to pay everything....or get food sometimes. Everyone on ODSP is struggling to make it by."
Odsp,foe4wwz,t1_foe32zm,1587696094.0,Thank you! I emailed him!
Odsp,foe4mvu,t1_foe4j9q,1587695933.0,:( see what I mean :(
Odsp,fodwtrv,t1_fodtxzq,1587691630.0,Yup! It’s definitely frustrating and degrading. But you know all I do is drain the system I guess.
Odsp,fodfdae,t1_foder76,1587683991.0,Thank you. Yeah they do.
Odsp,fodf4rd,t1_fodebs5,1587683909.0,"Unfortunately they don’t care. So I have called and left a message at my regular dentist’s office and hopefully they will call me back if they can do something. I will wait and try to deal with it, if I can’t deal with the pain anymore then I’ll go into the Emerge department because who knows what kind of infection I have and at that point it will be severe. I already have depression and anxiety and today just made me feel worthless."
Odsp,fobv5x0,t3_g4gorc,1587664013.0,So he hears the need and our government “hears us” what are they doing? What are they going to do to help us?
Odsp,fobu4yj,t3_g5k1od,1587663685.0,We ALL should be getting $2000 a month as a single person and more as a family. They have just proven you need at least $2000 to get by yet me as a single person on ODSP get $1000-$1169/ month to live.
Odsp,fnlm8ot,t3_g28o37,1587055935.0,I requested the emergency fund like a week ago and still haven’t heard from my worker lol
Odsp,fnit10m,t3_g188i9,1586985853.0,My worker isn’t getting back to me so I have no idea if I will get it.
Odsp,fnbmlco,t1_fnbbrj4,1586818227.0,It’s a husband and wife that own the house and a few other properties.
Odsp,fnatb1g,t1_fna4pc3,1586803450.0,The only way I have been able to find a place is by being upfront with the landlords when I go to see their apartments. I ended up getting a decent 3bdrm inclusive apartment. I don’t ever wanna move cause I will never find a place even close to this price again. ($1250).
Odsp,fms573b,t3_fuufpw,1586346932.0," But we ARE losing. Like I am paying more for groceries than ever, most stores don’t have a flyer anymore, and those that do, don’t usually have the products available as people scoop them all. I’m putting out more in cleaning supplies if and when I can find them. The average change in groceries is $2-4 per item extra. We also need assistance not just odsp but something that helps with the extra money I am putting out."
Odsp,fmove9x,t3_fw4ki2,1586269230.0,"This legit makes me mad. Honestly until Feb of this year I have worked full or part time, I am now in a position where I can’t even apply for this as I need the extended health benefits ODSP gives you and I also need the income. I am prevented at this time from working due to a health condition. Like why not offer this to everyone? Make it income exempt so that we can live for once? Like I am so angry. What do we get a ONE TIME CREDIT OF $100 (individual) or $200 (family). This is BS."
Odsp,flshymb,t1_flj80o7,1585442538.0,It’s so frustrating. Like I love the opinion that we (on social assistance) aren’t losing money. Cause I am spending a shit ton on groceries right now.
Odsp,flshkof,t1_fls757x,1585442286.0,Honestly I like hearing that you are even suggesting renting to someone on ODSP. Unfortunately we face horrible stigma and discrimination. When not everyone on ODSP doesn’t pay their rent.
Odsp,fls9gia,t1_fls5z7d,1585437199.0,"Honestly if it is ODSP it is guaranteed income. I have never, ever had a deposit bounce/be cancelled. It is just that we (on ODSP) don’t get a lot. Single people usually make $1100 depending. So renting a room in a lot of cases are the only possibility. If something should be wrong with our “file” ODSP will let us know what we need to do to fix it (usually)."
Odsp,fls6wct,t3_fqu06q,1585435638.0,Honestly. It sucks being on ODSP as people discriminate. I’m not saying you are. But if you are worried you can request to have the rent automatically deducted from their cheque. You have to fill out a form that their worker will process.
Odsp,fl56phu,t1_fl54y1h,1584829733.0,Oh I know. One of the people that commented was this preppy girl from High School who has no idea what it’s like to struggle. She was born into money.
Odsp,fl4ifxf,t1_fl4g1pq,1584814219.0,Cause apparently according to the jerks on FB....we are getting “guaranteed income” and we don’t deserve more than the working person.....oh and we “AREN’T LOSING MONEY.....” I pointed out several times to no avail that anyone right now on ODSP is actually losing money. I am going to the grocery store (the more expensive ones) and paying about $50 more to shop there. But apparently we don’t deserve anything as we are the dredges of society. Cause you know they are working class people. Even though we have worked for years of our lives and are sick now....that doesn’t matter. Cause we have guaranteed income. So apparently that is better.
Odsp,fl0fc4d,t1_fl0bthd,1584704476.0,Thank you. ❤️
Odsp,fl0amei,t1_fl03nyi,1584698996.0,Sorry?
Odsp,fkzrelp,t3_fk4nt8,1584678184.0,Well...have you gone to legal aid?
Odsp,fkz944a,t3_fiqevt,1584665577.0,But your doctor may do it differently and maybe will do it while you are there? I remember when I applied I was there when my doctor did mine. But it was a different doctor.
Odsp,fkz90ki,t1_fkz818u,1584665512.0,Yeah they do it without you there which is why I was freaking out. As far as the self report if you want I can send you a copy of mine so you can see how I wrote it. (I had a copy emailed to me by the receptionist at my doctors office.) but honestly if it is for mental health if I had a psychiatrist I would have gone to them rather than just my family doctor. :) if you want to see what I wrote I will black out all the personal info that I can. But you will get a general idea of what to write. I was approved and didn’t have to appeal and this is my first review. My doctor said she basically wrote on the report that nothing has changed.
Odsp,fkz7a6y,t1_fkz6vbu,1584664377.0,I didn’t know at all that I was being reviewed I got random papers in the mail that I had to go pick up from the post office and sign for. My review was supposed to be in May of 2019. So they were behind. To be fair I had gone off ODSP and then had to be reinstated. I am also on ODSP for mental health reasons. I panicked and had bad anxiety over the review. Especially cause I wanted to know what my doctor wrote. But all I can say is do the self report even though it’s optional. That way they will get your point of view on how your mental health affects you day to day. They also give you examples of what they are looking for in the self report.
Odsp,fkz6x9w,t1_fkyhffw,1584664143.0,"They do claw it back. I have been on EI and they take it back dollar for dollar. I wouldn’t have said that if I didn’t know, and no your tax return doesn’t get taken from you. Neither does your GST or OTB. 

What government relief fund? What are you reading? The relief fund is for EI and child tax benefit, as well as giving small businesses a break as well. As far as us (on social assistance) we get a raise in GST which is $400 for an individual and $600 for a couple. Maybe do your research and don’t be so rude! I have had enough of people being jerks the last few days. I’m not spreading misinformation. I used to work for the government and am quite aware of the Ministry of Community and Social Services code of operations. But thanks! 👍"
Odsp,fkz6bln,t1_fkyyxc6,1584663748.0,"I received the papers at the end of Sept 2019 and they had to be returned by Feb 2020. Honestly I was freaking out but I filled out the self report thoroughly and explained why I can’t keep a job at the moment but that I keep trying to hold a job and explained about my diagnosis and how it affects me. My doctor also did their report I had a decision within literally like 20 days. Just be honest with them. They do go by the doctor’s report to decide the self report is optional, but I filled the self report out with every way I am affected by my illness. They approved me and said “there is no further review scheduled at this time”. 

Just be honest!"
Odsp,fkygosf,t1_fkybgw8,1584648380.0,Yes you can apply even if you work part time however keep in mind ODSP will clawback the amount dollar for dollar and you have to have enough EI hours to qualify usually.
Odsp,fkygd3j,t3_fkw73w,1584648194.0,"Don’t you know we are all “lazy, selfish and greedy” or so I was told yesterday when I posted something on FB. You know cause I make $1059 as a single person on ODSP and I have to shop at the expensive store cause nothing is available at my city’s discount chains. So I’m spending on groceries the money that is allotted for something else to survive. Yet I’m greedy, selfish and lazy and should get a job, how dare I think I “deserve” any money when my income is guaranteed apparently.”"
Odsp,fky5uqf,t3_fjllso,1584642122.0,I honestly wish they would let you split the payments to twice a month. It’s easier to budget that way.
Odsp,fky5fj8,t3_fk4nt8,1584641816.0,"So normally even if you are denied approval, they still give you 3 months of ODSP after you receive you decision. (I just went through my medical review like literally received the decision Feb 28th). I still meet their definition of a disability. They have not scheduled a further review. So obviously there is a reason you aren’t sharing as to why you are now cut off....possibly you were caught not reporting things, or making income on top of what they were paying you and not reporting that. 

They give 3 months even if you aren’t approved in the approval review. If you did get declined you need to appeal it. A different person at the Disability Adjudicate Board will review your case. They go off of what your medical doctor is saying. If that fails you now need to go to the local legal clinic in your area so that a lawyer can draft something on your behalf making a case as to why you still meet the program’s definition of a disability."
Odsp,fky4txd,t3_fkxe3l,1584641434.0,They (ODSP) will make you apply anyways. If you work at all they expect you to apply and “try”. They will want a copy of the confirmation of the application (the end page when you apply) and then a copy of the decision letter saying whether or not you were approved or denied.
Odsp,fkukqly,t3_fiqevt,1584551212.0,"I am SO LIVID. Like I have been on ODSP since 2014. I have held full time and part time jobs while in receipt of ODSP (some months only receiving the ODB- the medical benefits). So literally I have worked more than I haven’t being on ODSP. I had my medical review last month and they found I still qualify and haven’t set a review date (so obviously I have a valid reason I am on ODSP) Oh and I don’t have children, so I won’t get the $300/child extra that others will on the child tax benefit payment. Why do people on social assistance always get overlooked or rejected? Like this is annoying."
sex,fkpiixv,t3_fjqco1,1584410964.0,"I have depression & anxiety and was just diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I had an amazing sex drive before they put me
On Prozac. Now I feel bad cause my man loved that I wanted sex 2 or more times a day. Now I’m like every 5 days I want sex."
sex,fkpidq9,t3_fjqco1,1584410869.0,Crap
PCOS,fko4jrv,t3_fjdrdx,1584379973.0,See I’m the same. It happened when I started on Prozac. I have literally no sex drive and it feels like a chore.
sex,fjbmrmz,t1_fjau1le,1583196819.0,Reverse cowgirl....you’re welcome. ☺️
sex,fjbhtnb,t3_fcgrt7,1583193596.0,Girl. Get up there and ride. Guys LOVE when a girl rides them. No matter how heavy you are literally. They hate in my experience when girls hold back cause of their weight/insecurities. Literally even if you aren’t act “as if” you aren’t scared to death to ride him. I have had guys literally say to me “I LOVE that you aren’t scared to ride me.” Yeah I god damn do cause I get off better lmao.
lonely,fj84cw3,t1_fj6lp1n,1583104876.0,♥️ Thank you so much!
lonely,fj6ejjs,t1_fj67ymp,1583069322.0,"I know how badly depression can hurt and hinder things. I also suffer from depression, anxiety and Borderline Personality Disorder. It was so bad before that I was up at 604 lbs (I have PCOS and I have binge eating disorder and food was how I coped with my feelings). I got to the point that I gave up hope. I ended up just pushing myself to go out for a walk once a day. Then that changed to me walking a few times a day. I started small cutting down on certain things and measuring and weighing my food. It was super hard and I had many setbacks. I started in 2015 here it is 2020 and I am down to 462 lbs. So -142 lbs down. I get mad at myself because here I am 5 yrs later and not down to my goal weight of 250 lbs. But in the past 5 yrs I have battled a lot of different issues that have come up, including a suicide attempt in 2016. But I promise you if someone is looking at you and not wanting to be with you because of your weight....you don’t want them. You WILL find someone. I have learned that you have to stop looking. Stop focusing on finding someone. That is when they will magically appear. When the time is right. If you end your life you won’t have the chance to have that love. There are woman who honestly will love you for who you are not what you look like. But it’s not about anyone else. It’s about you! If you are unhappy with yourself, take the time, don’t think about things and just work on yourself. I promise you, once you are in a better headspace....you will be surprised at what will happen."
PCOS,fj5bz05,t3_fbkco0,1583029073.0,Make sure to eat before you take Metformin like eat some food first and then take it. Cause it is so hard on your stomach and I had horrible nausea as well. I used to have to eat wait 20-30 min and then take the pill.
lonely,fj4aezl,t3_fbfycy,1583003839.0,"It sucks you feel this way. Talking as a big chick myself (462 lbs) yes I’m a big girl. I was 604 lbs at my highest weight and have lost, which brought me confidence in itself. It’s about your confidence. I mean I’m not a troll I’ve been told I’m “beautiful”,  but a lot of it has to do with confidence. I also try not to gauge my expectations too high....I was single in 2018-early 2019 and I went on lots and lots of dates and had lots and lots of fun ;) girl stop worrying about what people think of you and have fun! You truly only live once. Lots of men love big girls! It’s all about the confidence and if they don’t like you then “NEXT”. But I have friends of all shapes and sizes when I was a teenager I was always looking at my best friend wishing I was her, she was blond, and Petite and curves in all the right places. But as I got older (confidence really kicked in around 30 and I’m now 35). You need to get to the point where you think if you don’t like me “F-YOU”. It took me a long time and I had to kiss A LOT of frogs to meet my boyfriend who I have no doubt I will be with the rest of my life."
depression_help,fj49nfo,t3_fbdc0n,1583003362.0,Do it! Just think of how relaxed you will feel after! I also find after I shower it makes everything else easier.
