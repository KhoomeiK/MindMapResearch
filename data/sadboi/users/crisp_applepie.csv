I don’t know from personal experience, but if I ever knew love like this book, I would die happy."

askgaybros,eofrdzk,t3_brqhuy,1558541645.0,"Seemed very rushed. Did not like Bran being king. They ruined Dany’s character, in what seemed like a huge rush. Arya sailing west felt like no closure to me. Wish I knew what happened to Drogon. It was all very boring and anticlimactic, with a ton of plot holes and unanswered questions.

The only thing I liked was Jon heading north of the wall.

Dracarys to season 8."
