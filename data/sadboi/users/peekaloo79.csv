BPD,fjqbwvt,t3_fem5v4,1583570790.0,"I totally feel this, I so much want to be able to cope alone, be my own boss, not give 2 f*cks about what anyone thinks about me. The only way I can achieve this is if I withdraw though...which is equally as damaging as the constant neediness. I think the key is trying  to find and maintain some balance, although that's difficult to achieve also :-/"
BPD,fjqabtv,t3_feiih5,1583570213.0,"I'm in a relationship atm, and all my symptoms are back ..again..im starting to think I'd be better off alone, I mean before I met this guy I was in much better control of my emotions and life in general. Soon as he came along he was soo intense it blew my mind. Now things have cooled down a bit I still expect the same as when we first met, which is triggering me every couple of weeks, and I'm pushing him away ....arrrghhh why cant I just see the world rationally?"

sex,exthifd,t3_cu842m,1566568964.0,"I can so relate to this, before I met my ex had a great sex drive which gradually diminished..so ended the 5 year relationship, was having sex on average once per month, my ex never initiated, never said anything sexual, made me feel sexy etc, completely ruined my sexual self esteem.
