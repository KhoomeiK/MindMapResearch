Agreed! The thing is... The  uninformed publics are much more permeable to misinformation like the email scandal and Benghazi than the informed public, who will usually see through the hate rhetoric and vote for issues rather than for/against a candidate.

For example, a simulation reported that Clinton would've won with 56% of the popular vote if everyone had been able to complete a very simple test: recognizing 5 faces (the hardest was the face of John G. Roberts). Trump would've won with 52% of the vote if everyone had failed with 0 correct answer."

politics,fqgft54,t1_fqfga1h,1589345167.0,">they have probably passed it along to at least 2.8 others

Your number is accurate and inaccurate at the same time. 2.8 is an average that depends on the situation. For example, in NYC, it probably is much higher, since proximity and public transport make it very easy for the virus to spread. 

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, in the deepest reaches of rural states, it might be much lower, since contact with other people is much lower. 

&#x200B;

In Canada, we see the same thing happening. We have ""urban"" provinces, Ontario and Quebec and ""rural"" ones. About half of Quebec lives either in or very close to Montreal. A situation that makes it very easy for COVID to spread and infect people. Our elders tend to favor urban regions to be close to hospitals and hospices are also in cities, making the cities a place of choice for the virus' atrocious numbers.

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, Saskatchewan and Alberta have less population and urban regions are less dense and/or spread out. In this case, the virus can't spread as much, making them safer.

&#x200B;

tl;dr infectivity depends on many factors like ""rurality VS urbanity"" making the 2.8 very difficult to use as an average"

The governments' measures want to reduce the number of infections to avoid overwhelming the hospitals.

Closing schools (happening where I live) won't save a lot of people directly (healthy young people aren't at risk), but it might save people indirectly (family member with a lung/heart/immune problem). 

In my case, that's exactly it: a family member could get complications, which is why I limit my visits and try to avoid infection areas. Not for me; for that family member.

It's not a plague, where closing schools saves lives Literally. It's a respiratory sickness that *could* kill people with weaknesses and closing cities slows its spread.

AskReddit,fc5mwy4,t3_ega9qc,1577461780.0,"There are a lot of good advice about how to behave. Here is one about others' behaviors

As a regular, I do my own thing alone. I don't mind someone taking their time, but others will (often douchebags). My best example is one just getting pissed at me for doing biceps on ""his"" bench(don't know the word in english). He just went to another machine with fire in his eyes. He looked at me while doing his triceps with big angry huffs on each rep. Don't. Mind. Them. Assholes don't get a quicker lane.

Also, use a towel. Even if you're not sweaty and are very clean, use it for your own sake. I've seen my fair share of fluids (don't know which) and one guy (I hope they kick him out, he's just disgusting) just spits on the floor"
