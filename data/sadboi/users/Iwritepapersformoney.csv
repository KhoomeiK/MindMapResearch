I would also add of if you have major health issues you will pass on, especially if you can't even afford for the treatments for the issue. 
My parents checked off all of these. People don't realize they kind of screw their kids over for their entire lives in these situations. I have a lot of health issues that would have not gotten to this point or even be an issue if there were taken care of when I was a kid. An immune disorder runs in my family, it is an autosomal dominant disorder. To make it even worse they decided it would be great to go to the US instead of staying in a country with actual medical care. I never got the treatment I needed until I was an adult, and it eats up a lot of money. As a kid I was always really sick, missing months of school at a time, because I couldn't get the plasma I needed. We were poor enough that my parents found my brother and I jobs when we were like 10 doing apartment make ready even though I was always sick. It took forever to get out of poverty, until I was 27 and that is largely thanks to my SO with the combined income. 

To even go to college. It really sucks trying to go to college with no help and having to pay your own rent, bills, everything and then pay for school. Had to work multiple jobs in school. Colleges don't keep people like this is mine either so it made getting a class schedule that worked with my work schedule really fucking hard, then I had to resort to working night shifts and getting 4 hours of sleep a day. That had to be real great for my health. 

Everything is a huge fucking struggle when you are really poor and have no one to go to for help."

I want to wait a bit longer before going back to the gym. If I had mats though I could just train with my husband, so basically just this. Ideally I would prefer to work with another woman, or even just someone who is not 80lbs bigger than me though."

Yes even though they are trespassing you can still be held liable, it is the dumbest shit ever but you need to contact the police about the trespassing to protect yourself. Call the cops and post it. They are putting your family at risk too since you don't know what they have been exposed to and are bringing it on your property and playset."

I don't blame you. As someone who had to go to college 100% on my own, I am raging pissed for you. My mother was just really poor and couldn't help. It is hell going to college and having to work multiple jobs to try to cut back on the debt which you still end up having to get into. Instead of just focuing on grades the biggest hurdle becomes paying for college, paying for everthing. You had the chance to just go to college with your only concerns being focusing on your grades. Now you have to go through the same shit myself and others like this had to deal with. You were robbed of the change to just focus on school while your sister got everything even though she broke the conditions your grandmother set. The rewarded her for fucking up and stole from you to do so."

Right not many people don't have jobs and it would be incredibly hard to get a new job if you lose it. Do they not consider that, working from home is still working and if you don't work like she seems to expect, you will lose your job and yall will be pretty screwed. It's pretty sad you have to leave your house to get your work done."
