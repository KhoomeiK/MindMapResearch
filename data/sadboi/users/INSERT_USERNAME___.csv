We could be discussing a nation of 140 people without changing the mathematical reality of China’s situation. We can also see in countries like the USA that gains in productivity do not necessarily improve the material circumstances of average people.
changemyview,flulzej,t1_flugaqr,1585505293.0,"The critical difference in impact is the trend. The [fertility rate in China](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN?locations=CN) has decreased from a recorded peak of 6.385 in 1965 to 1.683 in 2017, compared to a decrease from 2.913 to 1.766 [in the USA](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN?locations=US) during the same interval. Looking at the [population pyramid for China](https://www.populationpyramid.net/china/2019/), we see a narrow base with two substantial bulges at around ages 30-34 and 45-54. There will be a point in the next decades where these individuals will stop working and require support from younger people. There are some similarities and differences with the Chinese and American pyramids. Both have similarly narrow bases, indicating a similar number of infants and young children, but the [American pyramid](https://www.populationpyramid.net/united-states-of-america/2019/) has fewer abrupt changes between the sizes of cohorts, and the segments with young people are somewhat wider than in the Chinese pyramid. There are also much larger cohorts above the age of 75 in the American pyramid than in the Chinese pyramid. 

&#x200B;

What does this tell us, broadly speaking? While the USA and China will both deal with rising numbers of dependent seniors, the increase will be much more drastic for China. The USA--for all of its problems--has experience taking care of a fair number of seniors with government programs, while China currently must care for a lower proportion of seniors. The beginning of this trend is also shown in the dependency ratio for the [USA](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.DPND.YG?locations=US) and [China](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.DPND?locations=CN) (dependency ratio is calculated as 100\*(number of people between 0-14 and 65+)/(number of people between 15-64); it roughly measures how many non-workers must be supported by 100 people of working age). China's dependency ratio is both higher and trending upwards, while the USA's is relatively steady. 

&#x200B;

Even though China and the US will both have large numbers of seniors stop working in the near future, there is one more difference between the two countries that is a game-changer: the USA is a nation of immigrants, and China--broadly speaking--is not. Per thousand residents, [3.9 people immigrate to the USA each year, while 0.4 people leave China each year](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2112rank.html). From a rough calculation, this means that about 1.275 million more people enter the US than leave each year, while about 557,000 more people leave China than enter during the same period. The immigrant population in the USA is [projected to grow massively](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/17/key-findings-about-u-s-immigrants/) in the coming decades, and they will bolster the economy in the same way that other working-age residents will. It's a major reason why the US population is projected to grow in the future despite a fertility rate below the replacement rate. China has no such boost in working-age residents to avert the looming demographic catastrophe."
changemyview,flucygt,t3_fr4mul,1585500127.0,"China has many internal problems that will hamper its potential as a global hegemon, each of which will complicate future growth. 

&#x200B;

[GDP growth in China](https://www.statista.com/statistics/263616/gross-domestic-product-gdp-growth-rate-in-china/)\--while still impressive and indicative of a more vibrant national economy--has been declining in recent years. While China will probably show good economic growth for decades, it's unlikely to return to its levels of growth in the 1990s or 2000s. Meanwhile, its [GDP per capita (2010 USD)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD?end=2018&locations=CN&most_recent_value_desc=false&start=1986), while continuously growing, is still leagues below many of the European and American democracies, and [the rate of growth for China's per capita GDP is also stagnating](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD.ZG?end=2018&locations=CN&most_recent_value_desc=false&start=1986). China is also a highly unequal country, with a [high Gini coefficient and staggering increase in Gini coefficient](https://www.imf.org/~/media/Files/Publications/WP/2018/wp18127.ashx) (the Gini coefficient is related to inequlaity; higher Gini coefficient means more economic stratification). What does all of this information tell us? China, while having experienced massive economic growth in the past decades, is unable to sustain previous rates of growth. At the same time, this money is largely benefiting the elites in China, with fewer of the material benefits of this growth reaching the population at large. Europeans and Americans are still generally much richer than Chinese people, allowing them to better sustain a consumer economy. 

&#x200B;

China has no shortage of looming crises, either. The One-Child Policy was in effect from the 1980s to 2015, and the Two-Child Policy is currently in effect. I want to be clear that the primary victims of the One-Child Policy were the women who were sterilized, who were forced to have abortions, and who had the government violate their rights to reproductive privacy, as were the girls who were killed at birth or denied citizenship. The One-Child Policy is a horrendous stain on Chinese history. That said, there are numerous effects of the policy related to China's future.

&#x200B;

The One-Child Policy was--in short--an unmitigated disaster that echoes into the present. Most obvious of its effects is the gender imbalance in China: [there's a California's worth more men than women in China](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/world/too-many-men/), or 112 men ages 15-29 for every 100 women of the same age group. If you consider that older men will also try to find wives, that figure changes to 280 men ages 15-49 for every 100 women ages 15-29. And the worst is projected for the 2030s. I can't fully convey how much of a crisis this imbalance is, especially for a partly agrarian society that is organized around marriage and the family unit. Aside from the epidemic of despair among elder bachelors in China and horrific surge in human trafficking within and without the country, there are concrete economic externalities of this situation. Because of the intense competition, men and their families are saving money to invest in real estate to attract brides; [China's gross national savings rate has risen to around 50%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNS.ICTR.ZS?end=2018&locations=CN-AE&most_recent_value_desc=false&start=1986) as the gender imbalance increased. Dowries (paid by the groom's family to the bride's in China) have also increased between 272% and 550% from 1994 to 2013. This requirement for such massive savings is simply incompatible with a healthy consumer economy. 

&#x200B;

The total fertility rate has fallen below the 2.1 required to maintain population size. The Chinese government hoped that allowing families to have an additional child would improve fertility rates, but [this has not materialized.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/business/china-birth-rate-2019.html) Since birth rates are falling as life expectancy increases, then China will develop a population with too few young people to support retirees; this is especially concerning considering China's culture of filial piety, as older adults rely on their families for support, rather than the underdeveloped social safety net. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences also predicts that--with current trends--the state pension fund risks insolvency in 15 years. With more pensioners than taxpayers and already low consumer spending, it will be difficult to foster the continuous growth needed for China to become the global juggernaut you fear.

&#x200B;

Essentially, China will almost certainly experience a catastrophic bust as its social changes, heavy-handed policies, and low incomes at the bottom of society intersect in the 2030s and 2040s. While I doubt this would lead to the country's demise, I think it would avert a shift to a global order headed by China."

AskFeminists,floqjh0,t1_floi2wj,1585343449.0,"It’s not a full axis, but the extent to which patriarchy oppresses people is determined by their distance from the hegemonic male standard. Even though men as a group are not oppressed in comparison to women, there’s absolutely a hierarchy of oppression within men as a class. Because the hegemonic standard of masculinity is highly predicated on sexual prowess, dominance over other men, and impossible physical excellence, having a small or micropenis moves a man farther from the hegemonic standard and its benefits. Would I ever say that, by virtue of having a micropenis, a man is as oppressed as a woman least oppressed by patriarchy? No. This doesn’t mean, though, that patriarchy isn’t why men with small penises are mocked acquaintances and friends, shamed by sexual partners, and internalizing a great deal of patriarchal self-hatred. 

TL;DR: maybe there’s a better word than oppression, but whatever penalty society inflicts on men with small penises cannot be uncoupled from patriarchy

Edit: also, not all forms of oppression harm all groups in the same way. Racism oppresses all people of color in our society, but the extent and means by which that oppression takes place depends on many things. Asian people and Jews aren’t denied home loans in the same way that Black and Hispanic people are, but we’ve historically seen how our society blames plagues on Asian people and Jews moreso than some other groups."

Take the idea that men should be dominant in their households; why should the person who is likelier to die in war or be away from the home for months/years also be responsible for all major decisions? Wouldn’t a female-headed household provide more stability in a society where they are practically imprisoned at home? If we’re discussing physical advantages, then I agree that men and women have natural advantages in different spheres, but I disagree that our psyches have been specialized in similar ways"

changemyview,fh4synw,t3_f1cpnc,1581281803.0,"Honestly, it sounds like the real CMV is that we should universally talk more with strangers, which is what I’ll be responding to. Meeting new people can definitely benefit those involved in the conversation and society at large, but I think you’re overstating the need to speak with *strangers* specifically. Many people meet their social needs with people they already know, especially if they have strong relationships with friends and family. 

But let’s say we should talk to more strangers in coffee shops and the like. First of all, most communities are segregated via nearly every demographic you can think of, like race, age, wealth, and politics. It’s unlikely that you’ll cross many divides by talking to other patrons of your local cafe. Secondly, there’s little evidence you’ll have much in common or learn about your common interests from a short conversation between strangers. It’s better to find groups with whom you share an interest (recreational sports leagues, book clubs, etc.) if you’re looking to make new friends. Most importantly, there’s the issue of safety, which many people have already discussed. For groups historically affected by violence from strangers, the invitation for strangers to start conversations would inevitably cause harm.

Ultimately, I think it’s great that you want to meet new people and are willing to take the first step in meeting people, but that’s because it seems to be good *for you*. Many others are happy and safer within their own circles, and it’s somewhat presumptuous to think everyone will or should share your values."
bestoflegaladvice,fgn0bq5,t1_fglwbkf,1580935280.0,"We can reasonably infer that LAOP’s wife is Chinese because she went to China to deal with a family issue, but he didn’t. If the relative had been one of their children, then it would make more sense for both of them to go. It’s also obvious that sinophobia is rampant in the wake of this new strain of the virus. I would put the odds of the HOA’s actions being racially motivated specifically with regards to LAOP’s wife at 97%. 

Also, the panic surrounding China cannot be uncoupled from racism at this point. The discourse has been tainted by racist stereotypes about what Chinese people eat and their collective public hygiene. The HOA was being racist."
MensLib,fgmgpxm,t3_ezc8aw,1580924201.0,Why would I truncate my career opportunities to be treated like a potential child predator?

No man should need to face that kind of discrimination in the hopes that their sacrifice will ease others into accepting male caregivers.

BoJackHorseman,fgj0osr,t1_fgh3rur,1580834752.0,"I think a major point of his character is as a foul to BoJack in this specific way, though. Todd and BoJack both coast through life without really thinking of the future, but they approach the future very differently. Todd is optimistic and cares for other people, while BoJack is pessimistic and generally selfish. Todd’s mistakes usually result from naïveté and his childlike trust in others, while the negative consequences of BoJack’s actions are generally caused by his conflicting desires to punish himself and to feel like a good person, regardless of how his actions affect others. 

This difference is key. Todd is happy, with a fulfilling relationship, a job that’s perfect for him, and numerous friends. BoJack is trying to become happier, but his sins destroyed his relationships and his prospects. 

I’d also argue that Todd’s line to his father (“why do you need me to be successful on your terms?”, or something like that) is a good response to your argument. He’s happy and he makes others’ lives better; what’s wrong with that?"
