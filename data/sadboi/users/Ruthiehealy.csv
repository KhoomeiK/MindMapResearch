I keep reading that you're stuck in that apartment because of a year lease. Well, I've been wanting to transfer apartments in my complex to try to at least get out of the place where my attacker knows where I live. I can relate to opening the door everyday and expecting struggle or worse. I have alienated friends, family and stay in bed for long periods of time. So I don't have the money/help to transfer because of that, but it might be a big possibility for you. Considering the circumstances it might be a fee, but at least you wouldn't be in the same place it happened. I don't know if this is helpful but, thank you for posting and being brave."
