Justfuckmyshitup,fauxqsj,t3_eal9c1,1576353846.0,I've been cutting my own hair for a decade and have saved thousands. Its really not hard to execute well at all.
dating,faskixt,t3_eaga7x,1576328322.0,"Here's my advice, but its mostly for this whole sub rather than just this post..

Just stop dating and wanting a companion. The landscape has changed significantly even just in the past 10 yrs and modern dating is a culture nightmare that I don't recommend participating in. The only way to win is not to play because the ROI is low. So instead of dating, redirect that focus and attention on making yourself more desirable to YOURSELF, which will inevitably make the right people also feel the same way about you.

Its all about invulnerability now. Nobody can pay attention long enough to give anyone an opportunity to connect with them. Theres this false sense of entitlement that seems to be omnipresent. It's quite comical, really.

Better to build your own empire and make them come to you. And if they don't, well...you got your dignity still. Have gratitude and acceptance for your situation and try to find contentment in your solitude. 

You can all tell me to fuck off now."

lonely,f9ne22i,t3_e60mrc,1575482601.0,"It'll take a while but eventually you'll find contentment in your solitude. I've been technically single for about 4 years now. In that time I've had my fair share of dating and encounters and ultimately decided the juice isn't worth the squeeze. I no longer participate in forced experiences with people from dating apps. Additionally, I work from home and I'm not on any social media (except reddit) at the moment. Because of this I have A LOT of alone time and almost no distractions..

When you feel lonely learn something new. Study. Build your career. Perform some self-investigation; go into a deep focus on what you want out of life. Meditate. Read books, work out, etc..you have all the time in the world now to become a better version of yourself, and that will attract the right people to you at the right time.

Patience, gratitude, and acceptance are key."
