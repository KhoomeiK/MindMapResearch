Have you tried any decompression devices? I used an inversion table once and felt amazing afterward. They’re so expensive though. They make horizontal back decompression devices you can use, but I don’t think I’d want to do that before talking to a doctor or physical therapist. I just searched “how to safely crack your back” on YouTube and they have tons of videos. I haven’t tried any, but I’m tempted. Just be careful if you do decide to do it!!"

ehlersdanlos,fmv3eg0,t3_fxhnp2,1586405085.0,"Do you have dysautonomia? When I first developed POTS a couple of years ago, I would always get an intermittent low grade fever that appeared almost every afternoon for a several weeks. It was accompanied with some of the things you mentioned.. like the itchy skin and sore throat/cough. Also, fatigue, shortness of breath, major brain fog, tremors, heat intolerance, night sweats, constipation that became chronic and caused all sorts of fun issues such as hemorrhoids and an anal fissure, and of course a skyrocketing heart rate upon standing. I know there is a strong correlation between EDS and POTS and I think my low grade fever was a manifestation of when my POTS was at its worst."

I obtained my master’s degree and worked for over a decade in skilled nursing facilities, hospitals, and home health settings. I have loved it, but I suffer from multiple chronic illnesses that have progressed to the point where I can no longer work. I was laid off from my job last year, just a month after returning to work from having taken an approved medical leave of absence. It also happened to be the day before I would have been eligible to receive disability benefits through my employer. I don’t think that was a coincidence. I hate the whole system? It infuriates me."

I was laid off from my job last year a month after returning to work from having taken an approved medical leave of absence. The lay off also happened to be the day before I would have been eligible to receive disability benefits. So I lost my health insurance and had to use what was left of my savings and a hardship withdrawal from my 401k to continue paying for my medical care. My 18 month old daughter has been denied Medicaid because I refuse to attempt to collect child support from the bio father who became very abusive when I got pregnant. I had to get a domestic violence protective order, which he violated. So now I have been paying out of pocket for my daughter’s healthcare too since October. I’ve exhausted all of my money and have nothing left. I’ve applied for social security disability because I am just too sick to work. I have Ehler’s Danlos Syndrome (EDS) which is a connective tissue disorder that causes a lot of chronic pain. And when I had my baby, I had to have a c-section, and doctors believe that the EDS combined with abdominal surgery triggered me to have POTS, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. I get debilitating migraines too and my health insurance denied the new medication that was starting to work. We had food stamps for 3 months but they won’t give them to us anymore. I literally don’t eat some days just so my daughter can have enough food. 

Okay that was a super long tangent. I’m sorry, I am just so angry at all of it!!"

It helps to find solidarity with other who don’t give a shit either, because there should be more to life than worrying about paying off that kind of debt when you can’t even afford what you need."

Do you ever just want to up and move to another country with socialized health care and better treatment of their citizens? Where would a place like that even exist? 
I’ve pretty much come to the conclusion that I’ll probably never pay off my student loans, so I really try not to stress about it. What’s crazy too is I’ve been contemplating starting a different career for a while now, but that would probably require more school And therefore result in more student loan debt. Maybe I’ll just be a professional student 🙃"

lonely,fmap26h,t3_fu0gft,1585902179.0,"I hear you, girl. My heart hurts for what you’ve been through, and I’m so incredibly sorry. Life can really throw all kinds of crap at us and add insult to injury. It never turns out as we plan it in our heads, does it. 
I’m 36F and if you asked me 10 years ago where I’d be and what I’d be doing with my life right now, the answer would not be remotely close to what is actually happening. I have a chronic illnesses that have gotten a lot worse over the last year and a half. It’s robbed me of my career, my ability to take care of myself and my toddler, and I basically have no friends left. I only share this in hopes that you will feel less alone and maybe find solidarity in others’ struggles. 
It’s good that you reached out and I hope you are reading and getting good support as a result. You really are never alone. Do you enjoy reading or listening to audiobooks/podcasts? That’s been my saving grace lately. If you have a library card, there are several apps that you can use to access free audiobooks or ebooks. I use Hoopla. Maybe you can find something to get interested in and distract you, at least for a bit. Also, I don’t know if you’ve ever tried meditation and/or yoga, but it can be really helpful. And with the pandemic and people having to self isolate, there are a lot of people offering their services and programs for free on various platforms. And of course there’s always YouTube, you can literally learn any skill you ever wanted to know about. I enjoy finding funny or cute things to watch on YouTube, it can at least help a little sometimes. 
Keep fighting the good fight and hang in there. Nothing lasts forever and your life could be and probably will be so very different a year from now. Best wishes to you!! ♥️"

I have POTS (postural tachycardia syndrome) which is probably why I get the migraines. I’m not sure if my neurologist explicitly stated that when filling out the prior authorization form for insurance. I’ve called her to see about it. Out of pocket with GoodRx it is $559 (for one injection/1 month), which I definitely don’t have the money for, but for some reason the pharmacy is saying I cannot pay out of pocket for it even if I wanted to. So I’m very confused."
