thebachelor,fr3x0o1,t1_fr3wa3y,1589868691.0,I tried to find her yelp page but couldn‚Äôt find it anywhere. You can read her google reviews for the Habit Salon in Arizona. I didn‚Äôt know if you could actually remove reviews just assumed there was something like that because I know you can pay for your business to get promoted.
greysanatomy,fr3sv4w,t3_gmbj10,1589865336.0,I‚Äôve been experiencing migraines since I was 8 years old and didn‚Äôt experience any anxiety till a decade later. The one time I even hinted at anxiety to a doctor they immediately tried to blame my chronic migraines and headaches on it. I know now that I can‚Äôt let any anxiety show or I won‚Äôt be taken seriously. Wish Dr. Shepard was my neurologist.
thebachelor,fr3m5vf,t1_fr39qrl,1589860486.0,Lol my mom was doing my brother‚Äôs hair and our big dog ran in and nudged the scissors. He now has a bald section that is luckily filling in.
thebachelor,fr3l9aj,t1_fr39rog,1589859884.0,I wonder if they paid to remove the yelp reviews because there‚Äôs only one 5 star review. I don‚Äôt understand the point of a salon that basically only caters to influencer if they don‚Äôt pay. That‚Äôs so odd and yikes for the $500. üò¨
acne,fr2j6db,t3_gma2kf,1589838219.0,I honestly think the best course of action would be to see a dermatologist as soon as possible.
thebachelor,fr1vmg2,t1_fr1nw3v,1589826696.0,I have naturally really strong brows (kind of like Lily Collins) and people used to make fun of them. Those same girls are now paying for microblading lol.

glossier,fqv2wtx,t1_fquzt3e,1589668796.0,Thank you! I‚Äôve never use glossier before so excited to see how it turns out. When I searched wowder in the sub people were mixed on application but powder last makes sense. :)

fatlogic,fqu4pt0,t1_fqu3utg,1589651980.0,There are a few razor brands that deliberately leave out pink tax now. I have the Billie and their products all smell nice too.

Sephora,fqs2tom,t1_fqryqdb,1589597248.0,It has an unexpected fruity smell but I think it feels nice on the skin and did notice some brightening.

SCAcirclejerk,fqav19p,t1_fq8qinw,1589225767.0,I tried to get on board with the ordinary but my skin ends up getting irritation and they just don‚Äôt feel amazing on my skin. I‚Äôve gotten crazy good results with my curology and Peter Thomas Roth Niacinamide. Even though it‚Äôs more expensive at least I‚Äôm seeing results. Went through 3 bottles of TO niacinamide before I gave up.
Sephora,fqam46i,t1_fqa3o5r,1589221395.0,I live the blue sensitive skin rice polish it‚Äôs amazing

menstrualcups,fq7h5za,t1_fq7fu0i,1589146334.0,The Saalt small was a disaster for me. I think it was too rigid so it was painful. I emailed the company and they sent me the Saalt soft and I‚Äôm going to try that one instead.

SkincareAddiction,fq6j3d1,t1_fq6af6q,1589132502.0,I heard that if you use clindamycin for a long time you can become resistant. I would message your derm provider and see if you can up your dose or swap out an ingredient. Have you tried tretinoin or azelaic in your mix? Tretinoin in particular is great for reducing/preventing breakouts.
SkincareAddiction,fq6itrw,t1_fq51d6x,1589132357.0,People seem to hate on curology but it‚Äôs helped me so much that I feel relieved every time I see my skin. Glad it‚Äôs helping you too!

tretinoin,fq1go0m,t1_fpzbc1p,1589045483.0,Microneedling did amazing things for my skin. The first time I went though the aesthetic nurse convinced me to do a jessner chemical peel right after and I was jumping out of my skin from the pain. No one do that...just the microneedling alone will produce results.
Sephora,fpwls0k,t1_fpwf8xc,1588965703.0,It‚Äôs such a great set :)
thebachelor,fpwl73f,t1_fpvbpfc,1588965405.0,I feel really bad for her...on til tok she wrote a comment saying she‚Äôd lost weight after struggling with all the hate she gets. I get that she had a few cringe moments but I bet a lot of the people hating on her wouldn't look too great on national tv either. It's stressful and highly edited. I think she's actually pretty entertaining on tik tok.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fpsr73e,t3_gf9l77,1588878233.0,Aerie has amazing bikinis and I know they have a wide fit a wide range of body types.
HaircareScience,fpqws4r,t3_gf1297,1588834600.0,I heard that if your hair takes a while to dry it‚Äôs bad for the cuticles to be swollen for long periods of time (not sure how true/correct that is). If you are going to blow dry I would do lower heat and use heat protectant.
Sephora,fpqixwg,t1_fpqi5zb,1588823869.0,Coloring your hair even if you‚Äôre really careful inevitability causes some damage so olaplex is a great bond builder. This is a nice set but the most important olaplex product is no. 3.
Sephora,fpqbv3z,t1_fpphisn,1588819351.0,"If you regularly apply heat, go in the sun, or color your hair you will likely benefit from olaplex."

fatlogic,fpok1n5,t1_fpojbrh,1588785809.0,What I mean to say is that even if she were to lose weight and continue writing songs no one should have the right to say that she isn‚Äôt or can‚Äôt be Meghan Trainor anymore because of it.
fatlogic,fpoj6jj,t1_fpnm1si,1588785394.0,Personally I don‚Äôt associate MT with her weight either and I think it‚Äôs ridiculous that people do that.

My professor flipped out on her. It‚Äôs like some people don‚Äôt get that privacy is a thing.
Sephora,fpmi976,t1_fpmfdfc,1588733659.0,It definitely is if your hair is damaged or colored.

PCOS,fph5f81,t3_gddd51,1588615280.0,Some people are just ridiculous and immature. If you look at the Billie razor adds on YouTube there are so many immature comments and people writing that even leg hair is unhygienic. I‚Äôd like to see someone tell a man that his leg hair is unhygienic.
thebachelor,fpfitgt,t1_fpfa8os,1588572549.0,I think SF is cool place to visit but I wouldn‚Äôt want to live there. I lived there for a bit and there was constant thick fog in the morning and a dreary mist all the time. Give me LA any day over that.

beauty,fpavt0l,t3_gca855,1588456751.0,I‚Äôm not really impressed by glow recipe. I‚Äôd start with the ordinary particularly azelaic acid because it can help with the redness and inflammation caused by rosacea.
thebachelor,fpau0aw,t1_fpag9d9,1588455681.0,I honestly feel like Peter seemed really confused throughout the season. He seemed really in his head and like he was letting extraneous factors (ie the whole Alayah situation) impact his decisions. Just my take. He made some mistakes but I still wish him the best.

Sephora,fp7ploz,t1_fp7ovke,1588375189.0,I think one of the lines is anti-frizz or something. The only other product I use from them is the Don‚Äôt despair hair mask which I like.
Sephora,fp7mkp8,t1_fp7k6r6,1588373480.0,I personally have no issues with that. I think it‚Äôs amazing and it‚Äôs probably one of the most nourishing conditioners I‚Äôve ever used but everyone‚Äôs hair is different. I‚Äôve also used the olaplex shampoo and conditioner and enjoyed those although the conditioner wasn‚Äôt as moisturizing as Briogeo.

Sephora,fp7hm3e,t3_gbrffe,1588370782.0,I love the banana coconut duo from Briogeo with olaplex no. 3 as a weekly treatment. This combo has made my previously dry and brittle hair much healthier.
Sephora,fp7hg4p,t1_fp74c51,1588370690.0,I noticed that if I use only a small amount of hair it‚Äôll latch easily but I personally like to let it grab it and twirl the wand up. I can still do my whole head really fast that way.
Sephora,fp7h86r,t3_gboxjq,1588370572.0,"I got mine this sale and I love it. I‚Äôm not the best at curling and previously could only use wands. I personally found it really easy to use and was able to create a beautiful curled look on my first try after watching a tutorial on Dyson‚Äôs instagram. I really liked that my hair didn‚Äôt feel singed like it does with traditional hot tools. For reference, I have colored hair that falls 3 inches below the shoulders and is thick with fine individual strands."

Skincare_Addiction,fp5ah2d,t3_gbdm7u,1588322069.0,First of all never be embarrassed to see a dermatologist. It‚Äôs their job to help you and believe me they have seen it all. If it‚Äôs on only one side it could be the side you sleep on or if you talk on the phone a lot and put it to your face. I‚Äôve also read that certain pores can become clogged repeatedly due to clustered oil glands or if you pick at the skin repeatedly the pores can become damages which leads to a vicious cycle of inflammation. Since this is a reoccurring issue I think the best course of action would be to see a derm if you are able.
