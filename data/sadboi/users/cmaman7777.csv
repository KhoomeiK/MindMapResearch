Easier said than done but you have more control over your life than you think. I know this is hard because a lot of our happiness comes from our sexual functioning but it CAN and will get better.

Pay more attention to how long/hard the erections last when you just wake up and then start to notice patterns between when you begin actually thinking about the boner and how the boner changes when you're expecting it to deflate.

It really drains my hope for the future. Poachers killing off species, politics ever spiralling into the shits and not wholly focusing on bettering THE PLANET or working together as a species for a better future. We seem to be digressing into religious fundamentalism, and corporate entities are more powerful than ever that singlehandedly attempt to increase profits at the expense of fucking colossal demographics. It's like the more you open your eyes to how the world works, the more jaded you become. How can you not be depressed unless you're completely blissful? And in bliss, how does one learn about and better the world? It's such a fucking jumble that you don't know where to start that you just do nothing. Compounding this is the futility of working a job and killing yourself to make ends meet, to pay bills that rack up, so that in the end you can bring children into a world you already hate?
