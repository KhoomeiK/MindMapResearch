illnessfakersgonewild,fhzliiy,t1_fhk568t,1582002934.0,I understand that. I realized eventually due to social cues that my behavior was offputting to some and J suppressed it to fit in. Now as an adult I am trying to unlearn certain behaviors. I sway back and forth when I am genuinely Happy/excited. I naturally stop myself and try to refrain from it.. but it takes even more willpower to ignore what's acceptable and allow myself to do what feels necessary.  And stimming is a necessary outlet.
