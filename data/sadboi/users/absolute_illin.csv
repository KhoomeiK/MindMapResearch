Of my knowledge about SZA, it's extremely debilitating in it's early stages, and untreated stages.  Sometimes people get better and are able to live fully functional, mostly normal lives.  Some never fully recover, just doing the best they can do, in their own way.  It's a spectrum, and at any given time, someone with SZA can fall on it.  

By loving someone who has Bipolar Disorder, I can tell you:  I have adopted some form of a caretaker role in our relationship at times.  I put her needs ahead of mine.  My only absolute is, she *has* to take her meds.  They're skipped often, but I keep trying with her.  When she takes her meds: our relationship is possible, real life is possible.

I really advise you to read and research what this disease is really about.  Positive symptoms can be controlled with medication, but negative symptoms are persistent and chronic.  They can be almost impossible to overcome, even *on* meds.

You have to understand that the behaviors you're describing are more than likely, not relationship flaws;  they are his chronic, (possibly) life-long illness.

I find private insurance to be fine, so far, after getting it this year.  I don't really remember much about being on Medicaid, aside from if a doctor ordered some sort of service or test, it just happened.

Private insurance takes a bit more legwork for me:  finding a doctor who will take my insurance,  what meds are covered, etc.  Costs are meds are a big factor, because I'm trying different meds to find which one works.  But my main AP, is $15/mo, with insurance and a copay card found on their website.  If her doctors now are accepting state insurance, check to see if any of the providers you are considering are accepted.  It's hard to give up a good doctor, esp if they're not covered.

The terms copay, deductable, and out of pocket maximum are important.  I'm *guessing* you'd want these all to be on the low end, which means a higher monthly payment.  If you reach your deductable fast, I think everything after that is covered.  Mental health can be expensive.  Balance what you want to pay every month vs how much she is going to the doctor, getting meds, therapy, tests, etc.

I hope this helps, I'm not sure if this info is what you're asking for.  If it is, if you have any other questions lmk, since I just researched all this stuff at the beginning of the New Year.

My parents helped me rehabilitate enough to be self-sufficient: an apartment, a car, a job (and SSD for a while).  The part that was more subtle, and hurt worse was moving on emotionally.  They were ready to live their life without children.  Trips, vacations, new cars are what they wanted.  They didn't want to be dragged down in life by an infirm (adult) child.

Similar, but different.  There's some degree of narcissism involved in this story, which is too long for here.  Point being: after my parents cared enough to set me up with the things I needed not to fail; they moved on, first financially, then emotionally."

Sometimes I just keep repeating, ""Shut up, shut up.""

I'm pretty ok when I'm calm though.  Maybe it has something to do with being stressed?"

This story hits a bit close to home for me.  I wish you well, but SZA can be a chronic, lifelong illness.  My parents had to decide whether they were ""in"" or ""out"".  It' been about eight years since we've spoken."

Do you follow anyone on Mixcloud?"

Glad your having a good year so far!"

Things used to be so simple, fuck complex adulthood."

Good luck with the counseling.  I got insurance on the new year, and part of it is cheap counseling.  I've decided to get counseling for the things in life I keep struggling with, as well.  I'm terrified because I have no idea what to expect, or even where to start.

We'll get through this, and succeed."
schizoaffective,fcxivhn,t1_fcxhzho,1578064033.0,"My (bipolar) SO told her past employer.  They were pretty indifferent to the actual diagnosis, but she didn't ask for accommodations.  She didn't get any leeway with her attendance, which was her issue.  I personally wouldn't disclose the actual diagnosis.  There's too much stigma around SZA, which they don't understand.  The whole situation might depend on how progressive the workplace is, IMO.

What accommodation are you asking for?"
schizoaffective,fcxhjzm,t3_ejgawa,1578063096.0,"I haven't told them anything about my medical diagnosis.  It's natural to seek support from the people you work with; but I'm afraid they wouldn't understand.  They don't need to know.  If the day comes when I need some sort of accommodation, maybe."

This was really interesting.  Would love to see any conclusions drawn from this study."
schizoaffective,fc35p01,t3_efts54,1577382072.0,"Maybe consider a therapist during this time, to talk you through the heavy stuff?

Just kind of my bleak worldview, I generally don't talk to anyone about anything that is going on with me (except here).  I always feel like a bother and a downer; but more importantly, expressing myself to other people in my circle never seems to help.  I'm thinking it's because some issues are just too heavy for the levels of relationships I have with people.

Point being:  Talk to someone who can help you work through issues, positively.  Just talking to regular people, you may get some support.  But, ultimately, if you want to move past this it may take some soul-searching, which I'm guessing not everyone we know is available for."
schizoaffective,fbsnvws,t3_ee3gzk,1577057767.0,"I used to binge drink.  But in the end it wasn't worth it, short-term and long-term.  Short term, since I think drinking on APs is rough, and hangovers are a bit worse, IMO.  Long term, I wasn't getting any better:  my anxiety, my delusions, etc.

TBT I was kinda over it at the end, drinking.  I haven't had a drink in four years.  But, wow, do I miss a cold beer at times 🍻"
