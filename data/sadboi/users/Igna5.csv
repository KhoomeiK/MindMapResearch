depression,fbqwcox,t1_fbqu1xt,1577036398.0,Agree with you 100%. It could be one of the reasons why we have one of the highest suicide rates in the world. It is very hard to open up to people when they judge you like that.

When I told them I have social anxiety(explaining what that is in the first place) they started laughing and told me that I need to work more or find a second job. My dad started making jokes that I eat too much and if I knew what hunger was I wouldn't have such ""stupid"" things in my life. On the positive side I am better now, compared to a year ago. I wish you to be strong!"

ukraine,f6np1s8,t1_f68fyip,1572996542.0,"Planning to move to Ukraine in 2020 to start a business. It is actually not too bad, I had a consultation with a lawyer. If you are setting up an LLC(TOV) its actually quite easy to get in(I am with an EU passport). 

If I remember correctly for around 1000 to 2000 dollars they set up the business, with the permits to live and do all the paperwork, open up a bank account(I am not sure about this one) + translate everything to English. If you are a business immigrant that amount shouldn’t be too much to get everything done.

I think you could get it done even cheaper if you understand Ukranian or Russian."

You should check out [privatbank](https://en.privatbank.ua/ovdps). I found some info on Ukraine's bonds on their website if I am correct. 

  
With my analysis, Ukraine should recover quite good in the next 5 years.

   
p.s. I am an amateur in investing, just posting my opinion"
Entrepreneur,f6fqdyc,t3_dr6zez,1572817000.0,Quite interesting. How would you make money out of this?
smallbusiness,f6e7vso,t3_dr1njn,1572801186.0,"I am in a quite similar situation. 

Started a short-term rental servicing(cleaning, check-ins, simple maintenance, basically everything the host could worry about) business around 3 years ago in Dublin, Ireland. Now I have around 5 employees(+-1 every month)\[part time and full time\]. I am generating around 13-16k euros in sales every month. It sounds quite good on paper when I am only 22. But I am still actually broke. My biggest expenses are salaries and taxes. I cant up the price because the competition will take over my work really fast. 

For the last half a year I am thinking to quit or just reinvest the little money I have left and get into tech or business where I could scale easier and bigger. I had consultations with other people who run small to medium-sized businesses and have more experience than me. I got different opinions, some people say just quit fast and move on another thing and try till you catch a better opportunity, some say to stick with it and build it more and reinvest the profits afterward and in 10-20+ years you should be financially independent. 

Maybe I was naive before starting(I was only 19 years old), but I would rather die than work on this for another 10-20 years. I have zero social life. I work from Monday to Sunday. I have put on 30 kg's in the last two years(66 pounds). My self-esteem just vanished. In the past, I was always the positive guy in the company, now subconsciously I get angry when I see happy people. Got anxiety, had depression(it is a little better now), can't fall asleep till 2-3 am even though I am tired. It even got hard to deal with people without being anxious. I know social media does not represent reality, but when I see other people my age just having a life out there, traveling, going out, having relationships, getting their hearts broken, falling in love, even starting families, it just makes me so much worse, it feels like I am watching a movie from hell into heaven. I never was a person like this before I started this project( I had 2 other failures before this one).

Coming from a lower middle-class family from eastern Europe(2007-2008 crisis wrecked them), it kills me every day to think that if I do not succeed I will need to get back into that life. I always think that I can not afford to make mistakes, even though I believe in business mistakes are unavoidable. 

My grandmother told me that in this world the strongest and the smartest thrive, while the weakest and dumbest struggle. I always try to do the best I can with this business, but maybe I just deal with what genetics and destiny, luck gave me and can not change anything. 

I will only give up on this project if I find a way to transfer myself over to a tech or a more scalable business. (on which I am brainstorming and analyzing the market nearly every time I get free time). 

I wish you to be strong and smart."
startup,f5reayt,t1_f5q2szd,1572392921.0,"Thanks, I actually read The Lean Startup some time ago. I will read the book you offered. Thanks!"
startup,f5rdss1,t1_f5qorv0,1572392667.0,"Wow. Thanks for the reply. The information you provided helps me see the situation I am in from another angle.

Regarding MVP pricing, I am not definitely sure I will take the offer, but from all of the people I reached out, the one for 10k€ seemed the most reasonable and the developer seemed he knew what he is doing compared to other people. In general, I found it quite hard to get an estimate of the price without giving out most of the idea and information(Of course, developers need the info to know how long it will take to create it and that's completely fine) 

**Price-wise do you think on average 10k€ for an MVP is reasonable?** I know it depends on the work time, the MVP complexity and the person doing the work, but is 10k€ the lower end to launch an MVP? I just want to know realistically where I am standing at. I found very different information online, would like to know your opinion on it.

&#x200B;

>My past indicates that a final release will be about 10x the effort of the MVP but your mileage may differ depending on how we both define MVP. The thing is, if your MVP works and you're onto something, new features will be one of many total expenses

This is one of the anxieties I have. If I launch the MVP and really see that the customers are using it and it's time to add new features and start building the final product, that I will be stuck at that moment because I will have no capital to move forward. I understand there is a long way to go to reach this. But in my short experience in business, I know how hard it is to compete with people and businesses who have more capital than you. I like to compare an undercapitalized startup as a video game played on hard mode and an overcapitalized startup as a video game on easy mode. You have to put the work in both to make it happen, but it's way easier on the easy mode. 

&#x200B;

>That's all assuming you can get users. If you have trouble getting your product into qualified users' hands, building the MVP is going to be just about useless.

I am 100% sure that the problem I want to solve is there, and to confirm that, there are platforms offering similar services and they have a high user count and people want to use it. Not that I am reinventing the wheel, somebody else is solving the problem already, but I just want to make it even simpler way. I did not find an existing platform that approached the problem I want to solve in the way I want to approach it. I might be all hyped up about my idea, but for sure I know at least 8 instances where I would have used the platform I want to create in the last month. Some people might even have much more need for it. 

Also, I am not copying any other platform and trying to make a better service, but there are very similar platforms out there, just their target market is a little different than mine.

&#x200B;

>Getting capital is really complicated. I have successfully raised capital for products I was iffy about and have failed miserably to raise funds for products I was completely sold on. In my experience, a lot of raising capital is about getting the right warm introduction to a person who can actually write a cheque.

Yes... The thing is, that I know people who know people that have an ability to invest in the lower six-figure part.(I think that would be enough to end the product or would at least help a lot to move forward) but they wouldn't even agree to talk with me if I don't have any users yet or making some money out of the product.

I read some books and articles saying that if you start a startup you should not even focus on the money and just do the best product you possibly can and focus on the people who use it, which I think is somewhat right. They say that if you get that right you will definitely find people who will invest in it. It's just that I always hate leaving my destiny to a ""higher power"" and thinking that it will figure out by itself while I just do my thing. So I am overthinking a little about it.

Thanks again for the information you provided. Not to waste your time but if you could collaborate on these questions I would be more than thankful:  


1. **Price-wise do you think on average 10k€ for an MVP is reasonable?** 
2. **What should I already know before approaching developers? Is it fine to approach the developers if you are still unsure about some features and etc, or it's best to know everything you want to have on your MVP. Not to forget, that this is my first tech project. I am sure there are things that I do not know or understand.**
3. **You do not know me as a person, but I am completely fine on working and grinding on my own. But going into tech, would you recommend finding a co-founder? Currently, I am all alone into this. I know it is not easy finding the right person, but I studied all the other successful startups and most of them had more than one or even two people working on the projects from day one.**
4. **This is a deeper question you can miss it if you are too busy, but how do you decide which idea has the most potential and which does not? Do you look into the people working at the startup? Confidence? The passion or capital they have? Or just the problem they solve? Because I believe there is a lot of good ideas out there, but for some reason, some ideas just attract people like crazy. It is interesting for me to hear the opinion from a person who has a lot of experience in launching products, the way you look at us who are hyped up about our ideas and the problem we want to solve.**

Thanks!"
