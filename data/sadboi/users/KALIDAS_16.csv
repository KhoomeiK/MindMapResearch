OCPoetry,fqzynii,t3_glls8i,1589778767.0,Awesome man. The poem was really good. It tells why we should be more open to what we want to say a d not hide. I thought it was a romantic poem until I read it would prevent bloodshed so it covered all the areas and people. Kudos to that. My feedback to you would be if you could have added comas in some part the flow was awesome but a suspense and a moment to ponder and feel could have been created. Great poem. Keep writing
OCPoetry,fqzyfcr,t3_gloxsk,1589778594.0,Great poem. The caffinated injection of politics and the break between is my favorite line. The imagery was very strong in this one and I could feel it. So kudos to that. The way of putting hopelessness and why do people drink and smoke is very well put. My only feedback would be to now use so many of and or. Great poem. Keep writing

The color blue gives a sense of melancholy too which is completed in the end of the poem. My feedback would be proper use of punctuation. The semi colon kinda disturbed the flow. Great poem. Keep writing."
OCPoetry,fqusd4x,t3_gko0gr,1589663847.0,Great poem. I enjoyed it. I love how you expressed a sense of stability and consistency even in crisis. My favorite line is broken families sipped through their own teas that Imagery is very powerful. This all felt like a video for me. The end message of moving on while taking a beating and crisis was well put. My feedback would be on punctuation like less usage of fullstop because it breaks the flow and less use of words like that and when. For example in 2nd para 2nd line would be probably better without it. Great poem anyways. Keep writing.

OCPoetry,fqcvyxw,t1_fqcupzy,1589270801.0,"Thanks for the feedback. The fool was a typo but I kept it eventually  thinking it can imply how they made a majority fool about light. Because saying the fool would be telling everyone is against him and not more like that a majority is misguided too. I used the before to put an emphasis on it trying to subtly tell that narrator is telling the old man he doesn't have **the eyes** to see as in proper and functional. 
This is actually my second try of the same poem. The first one didn't have any says and tells. It was very clean. But it was like I was explaining a spiritual concept of life and gave the guru/ teacher vibes. Because I wanted it to seem real. Often times whenever something starts getting educational or like life advice types I leave because I feel this is another guy who knows everything just like everybody. So I desperately wanted to avoid it and used said and replied constantly to make it more convo type. I struggled with meter a lot in this poem tbh like you said at one point it looked like a para from a newspaper not poetry. 
To use rhyme scheme or not confuses me a lot like aa bb or aab aab abab.
The overall motivation of this poem was to give a taste of the concept of God."
OCPoetry,fqcv22g,t1_fqc8hze,1589269908.0,Haha. It in some ways was trying to show those people. The original idea tho was when my nanny commented about God how you can't see it without trying. Eventually making me the fool.

OCPoetry,fqbjcre,t3_ghcx04,1589238067.0,Nice man. Feedback i believe this is your experience and just trying to vent then no problem but if you are actually thriving for poem I wished you could construct it better like the 9 para looked too crowded and suffocated tho on the plus side it gave an experience of the raw emotion. I really liked how the poem captured feeling and experiences so much like you really hate her and wanted to leave nut you still kinda like and love her. How you used striped of the armour and made you a man. Also the feeling we get when we love someone so much but they don't love us that much and we feel unsatisfied. It was a good poem which captured allm the emotions naturally. Keep writing
OCPoetry,fqbide7,t3_ghwv3s,1589237544.0,Really enjoyed it. First I thought why were you doing it and then you explained it quite well also that you do this to everyone. I thought it was for  someone special lol. The best thing about this poem is how it tells how small data can help us understand a person like most of the grammar nazi are perfectionist. Small things like that and how the narrator hope he can see that phone a little bit more. The poem was really good. By the way how did you use this format in reddit any special texts or formulas? Keep writing.
OCPoetry,fqb4fc1,t3_ghu1at,1589230398.0,It's very good that you have choosen such interesting topic to write poem about. I enjoyed the poem tho I wished you could have expanded it like why it becomes more beautiful when we fill cracks with gold and how it becomes more beautiful. And why they don't just throw it instead of repairing it with gold. Overall I think your poem gives basic idea of what Kinstugi is but you could have really expanded and make us understand. Keel writing
OCPoetry,fqb44jl,t3_ghux9c,1589230249.0,The concept is good. The metaphors were nice. I like that you use daughter of venus because venus is supposed to be God of arts and beauty. It captures the feeling when we get too much inspired and feel like a Superman and can do everything. And the fact in last line it seems that gods are standing before you to protect you. I wish you could use less words and keep it clean. Like in 2nd line you could have said you could swing there was no real use of using when. The poem was good. Keep writing.
OCPoetry,fqax9a7,t1_fqalmzf,1589226858.0,"Thanks for the feedback. I am from countryside where my natives is and I used to go there in my summers as a child. Sheeps don't really have a sense of individuality in my experience if one sheep goes somewhere everyone else will follow it. It once happened that one sheep started to walk on a train track and everyone else followed it and a train came and I think killed like 14 of them. So the idea is most of the people here do what they are said to without questioning. Often in our childhood we always compete to be first in academics, sports and those who are winners. We never question why. We run for a job we may not like that much but we want to earn money as much as our peers. Also sheep was also use in terms of black sheep cuz even your family is sheeps but now you defy them now you are a black sheep. A disgrace. Which isn't something worse than being a sheep at first place. Also the famous quote one month as a lion is better than lifetime as sheep. 

My sense of different is at least in the first place to question everything. Do you really believe in your beliefs until someone questions them. There are many things we have common in a way of thinking in this place. Kind of hypocrite. Like looks don't matter haha but they will cast only beautiful people according to the cliche society type and want same in marriage. Just look at insta or tictok all girls trying to look the same . They say money doesn't matter but people sacrifice their happiness, family, time for that little extra money. There are some rules we need to be the best we need to be this and that. I cannot be 100 percent different than anyone else I have two eyes they will have too. When I will see a lion we both will shit our pants. The different I mean is from the perspective."

Which I hope doesn't offend you but give the hippy vides with all the piercing and weed stuff. Kinda highlights the toxic traits about staying high all day . The tattoo point was really good tho. My fav line btw was Benzo addict deprecating poser. My feedback would be idk why but maths equation and wrongful invasion feels little out of place. Keep writing and keep using the ironies.
OCPoetry,fq7tkh7,t3_ggylk9,1589151921.0,Great poem. It very well puts how we choose to be alone so that we don't have any insecurity of people not actually liking us and trust issues but the problem with it is if you don't self love yourself a lot of times you will end up asking if you really like yourself and aren't just unworthy which usually leads to lot of self loathing. So it kinda gives emphasis on friendship and how it makes loves interesting. Tho it ends in a very sad note lol that how do I get it. If you are seriously looking for advice my advice will be just talk about anything just bump and say hi or wave your hand. I don't remember how I started talking to all of my current friends. Keep writing it was an excellent poem.
OCPoetry,fq7pwiu,t3_gh5szh,1589149814.0,I enjoyed it! Tho I couldn't fully understand giving it a green paper means I guess it's go ahead probably.

Keep writing.
OCPoetry,fq7pis1,t3_gh8m06,1589149595.0,Haha. This gave me a laugh. I love how the poet regrets asking meaningless question like how big the universe was and the God giving him useless answer.

My feedback would be in the first part you could write as the world we knew ends instead of using the brackets. The line weeks I have touched or been touched is good too. The line where two strangers smile at each other give hopes everything will be alright. The poem is like a story for me with background and everything. Keep writing
