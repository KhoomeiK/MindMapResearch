Anxiety,fd2d5nj,t1_fd2awwj,1578145502.0,I have and I’ve not had many panics as before when I wasn’t on it. I just have a lot of “What if” thoughts that throttle me constantly. I’ve stopped trying to reassure myself because I’ve heard it only makes it worse.

Anxiety,fckxe8u,t1_fckshfz,1577735243.0,You could try making conversation with whom ever your driving with. Admittedly it was hard to do for me because I have quite a bit of social anxiety. Even then saying hello or just telling them that your nervous can help to ease your anxiousness.

Anxiety,f9y79ql,t3_e74uja,1575724565.0,Is it normal for my chest to feel right and cold during a panic attack? It’s been causing my panic to become worse because I’m afraid I’m going to faint or die of a heart attack. It really tears me up while I’m working on my exams and daily work.
