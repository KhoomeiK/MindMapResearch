relationship_advice,fqd8gud,t1_fqcepal,1589283188.0,That is not good advice. OP is an adult and her sister is a minor.  If her sister is snarky enough to call the police thinking that “she’ll show her”. There will be a police report attached to OP’s name. Not something anyone wants following them around at the young age of 20!!

And if she keeps it up she will regret it someday.  Focus on yourself.  There has to be some free counselor that you can call.  Parts of what you describe is narcissism.  The mocking for example.  But that's easy to identify so when she starts that don't let it get to you.  Just laugh because it's ridiculous.
