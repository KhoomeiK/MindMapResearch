I can usually talk myself down and not react like a complete crazy person, but the compliments rarely make me feel good. They make me feel...gross? Which I know isn't the intention, but after having so many awful encounters I can't help feeling that way. No matter how innocuous (I love your hair), it can lead to something awful (being cornered in the bathroom at my own place of employment). So...I guess compliments register in my brain as threats? Which is fucked in some ways, I know that. But that's why compliments don't make my self esteem any better...at all. Sometimes they make it worse.

That all being said, girls do compliment girls more often than boys, and that's sad. And girls complimenting me has never lead to creepy situations, so they actually stick.

CPTSD,fkbftg3,t3_fhgino,1584032215.0,"I watched an interesting video with an ex-therapist, where he talked about how we discuss childhood trauma. He said something like - when we ask about childhood, and people say it was happy, we tend to move past it and accept it. But when there's an issue, we question it and try to determine the validity of that trauma. When, in all actuality, we should be digging deeper into the people that say their childhood was happy. No one has a perfect childhood, and no one's parents had a perfect childhood either. There are so many ways people can accrue trama without them knowing it, and that trauma can have really damaging and lasting effects.   


The problem is (in my opinion!) the nature of mental healthcare for most people. It's a conveyer belt system, and most people don't have access to deep, long-lasting talk therapy. And that's what is truly needed. 30 minutes twice a month isn't enough. Add to that most doctors are just looking to prescribe a quick fix and send you on your way. Take this pill and call me in a month.   


I was diagnosed with bipolar on my second session with my first doctor. Two sessions! It took me ten years to make any sort of progress towards understanding my trauma and how that's shaped me. My parents have trauma from growing up in a cult and having abusive families...I have my own trauma piled on top of that.   


No one gets to take the time to really get to the root of the problem. We just keep spraying it with weed killer, pretending it's okay, but the roots are still intact. That shit is gonna grow up again, guaranteed. And the more it spreads, the less other things have room to grow."

It *is* a problem that society teaches boys anything revolving around a girl ""isn't for them"", but girls are taught that things revolving around boys is for ""everyone"". There was a huge thread on r/writing about how boys don't read as much as girls because there aren't enough kids books aimed at boys, and I almost spit coffee onto my keyboard. Because that's just bullshit. Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, fucking...the Giver, Hatchet, White Fang; the list of books I read focusing on boys is astounding. Little House on the Prairie is a great series, but boys didn't read it because our narrator was a girl.
