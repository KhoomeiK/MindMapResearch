And the ENFJ will over talk the INFP only because they are passionate and like resolution immediately. This can cause the INFP to stop talking. INFPs need time to think. ENFJs need closure... otherwise they dwell on things thinking you are upset still from something in the morning when u have already forgotten. She will need closure. Agree to disagree or whatever. Just something. They need to know where they are in a group or relationship and the part they play. They need to know when they are pushing too much and the boundaries which INFPs dont talk about until they have surpassed their boundaries and are already too upset.. just something's I've recognized.

Its a 24 hour struggle every day!! We are strong, we are brave and we are smarter than killing ourselves.  Deep breathes. The only thing my parents could do is continuously telk me they live me, they support me and they love me just the way I am.  I found God through my rock bottom depresai ok n. I had to hate myself to learn how to love myself. I was at least willing to do whatever it took to not kill myself.... I said ""if ur real, u have 24 hours."" I knew if he was real, he would show me because he would know how serious I was. Thre myself into every ""people"" said helps... groups, as, alanon, acoa, church, serving and forcing myself to crossroads groups and loss groups every second I could. I tested God. We have been on a 24 hour basis ever since. That was 7 years ago.... I still wake up the same, unfortunately I now dream only of past traumas that put me straight into panic attacks when I wake up but I pray after I get out of it. Thank him for my struggles, praise him for the difficult times that are preparing me to help others and try to the day 1 minute at a time. I'm here if he wants to talk! I'm 31 female and was born again, celibate. Then taken advantage of and abandoned. I've felt both sides of temptation as well as codependency. I pray for his peace and understanding that value is given to each individual specifically for their beautiful rainbow of value to shine.  I'm 31 and am still working on the ine thing God told me/ what I knew from the start what I was meant to do. I support, I encourage,  and I fight for the unseen, not heard, dismissed and disadvantaged. Life is hard, school doesnt prepare us. We rely on our immediate family more than we will ever tell you. Just continue to be consistent in support. Not in fixing. Just supporting his statements, acknowledging his emotions, validating his thought process and allow him to talk out what different scenarios his ideas and thoughts would cause. 

I am a female born to marry, have a kid and be stable by 35... I've had a clock my whole life... I'm just now ready to even decide if I want a kid let alone trying to be with someone of this world with this society norm we are experiencing... I'm also an old soul and tend to vibe with 10 years or older individuals. I work from home for the largest international airlines as well as the largest international TPA for workers compensation and responsible for the entire nation's ER wage process. I dont see anyone ever. Lol I understand the feeling of being alone. I'm praying you find peace and understanding of the natural survival skills that your son does possess. Right now is a struggle but this forum is an opportunity for him to reach out. You cant make him. Supporting his thought process and enabling him to feel like a victum are 2 separate things. Just fyi. If he says he hates life, you say wow! That's a lot of hate. Can you be more specific? Then again if he says I'm lonely,  say that its completely normal to be lonely and is there anything you can do to help the situation? If he says no everything is horrible, let him know you love him more than life and that you are here for him whenever he needs and you will check on him in a bit. Let his emotions calm down. The. Check in. See if he feels like talking. All he needs to know is he isnt alone, that he is loved and that he is strong enough to deal with the emotions of being lonely.  That it's a normal feeling and it's okay to feel that way. You can be pitifulor powerful. Take care. Hope this helps!"

I didnt know until my late 20s that my grandfather read slow and he taught the doctorate program in psychology for OSU. So to say least I cant even imagine getting carried away... i feel guilty for even thinking it... But i had all these explanations from the world about what I need to do or be like or what's appropriate and how to coddle when giving criticism, or how to act in public to not speak truth... idk it's when I meat someone 1st time in my life that's like me.... I'm mindblown to think im a smart person... I always wanted to go to the smart classes with those kids but I was ADHD, unchallenged and learned real quick how that beauty wins and did what I had to to survive... high school sucked... lol I'm an artist though also, extrovert processor. So it was difficult.  My brother excelled as the golden child and called smart... I was grounded 24/7 doing more work after school... ugh.. lol just a really interesting place this is for me... idk. Thanks for your comment"

This I'm attached to by the words.Not EDM. More Rock. If I'm just needing to feel good, I put on led zeppelin,  zz top, arrow smith, queen etc..

If I want to feel pulled through movement of my soul, I listen to jazz and like...old school like the ""ink spots""... I live old music."

mentalhealth,fnuz887,t3_g4268h,1587275228.0,"Are you trying to make someone else happy by making yourself figure out how to do something when you dont feel it? Are you sure you're not just an INTJ personality type? You are only 16. Have you ever watched someone die in front of you? Have you had you partner die while you are dating them? Have you been sexually herrassed or assaulted?! Have you every lost your best friend?? By 16 this was my reality and a hell of a lot more... those who feel little, tend to feel the hardest and be affected by the moment or moments when that emotion finally arrive and they feel deeply. 1 experience can change your entire world... Just because you dont ""show"" emotion in some kind of ""perspective scale"" you're referencing, doesnt mean you need help feeling. I am a very private person. I am black and white too. I do not feel others perspectives most times but I do undertone black and white. I can process understanding emotions and why people feel an emotion but I dont feel that emotion. I've never had a kid... but for some reason because I'm a female I am supposed to know a mothers perspective....nope. no I dont. Not at all. Dont get that at all... lol"
