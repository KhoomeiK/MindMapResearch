I put all settings to max fps and cross the 144fps insanely easy , so then i put some more nicer graphics in there too till i stay about 144fps all the time because my laptop doesnt has g-sync so it will reduce the stutters. I also undervolted my cpu and made the clockspeed increase from about 3,5/3,6 to 3,9/4ghz and dropped the temperature with about 15°celcius. I choose this laptop because of the battery life and the slick look. Am planning on using it during my study too and for work in the future. Depending on ur work tasks u wil have to choose ur laptop. For example i will be following a cyber security study so my requirements will be 512ssd 16gig ram to run insanely smooth and thats about it. So for also gaming i also took the 1660ti. I believe RTX laptops are just wayy too overkill."
