MinecraftHardcore,fq7293q,t1_fq5aoy3,1589140849.0,"Well considering I don’t have a channel and your gloating about having views I’d say your an even bigger asshole than I thought. Plus I looked into you a little bit and found, no you didn’t your most popular video got 1k views, also your reddit name still has it in it, and isn’t that against the rules too? If we’re following your logic. Even bigger, I watched a few of your videos, your welcome for the views btw, you don’t deserve them, and your recording quality is shit, if your “latest video” on a channel you don’t want to show because it’s not real hit 100k views then why isn’t your recording quality a little better? Also you seem to be young by your interests, Fortnite and Philza. I’ll admit I like philza too, and that’s not the kicker, the kicker is fortnite, and all your reddit activity is focused toward philza. Finally, nice copy and paste of content with the 5 year hardcore death."
MinecraftHardcore,fq46sq2,t1_for9pda,1589074244.0,Yet whenever someone else says I just put out a new video and links it you belittle them and act like an asshole.

Abortiondebate,fov04st,t1_fou1mz2,1588093221.0,Your not addressing the fact that your not even talking about to being sentient or not. You claim it’s still fully human but I’m disregarding it and killing it anyway
Abortiondebate,fotbylf,t1_form0kb,1588049627.0,Yeah you want me to admit you were ‘half’ right. The ability to process pain is there at 8 weeks but isn’t fully developed until 23
MinecraftHardcore,for840d,t1_foj9fgg,1588007783.0,Being an asshole to everyone trying to make some good content for this sub is not a good way to grow your channel
Abortiondebate,for7frx,t1_foqdwo8,1588007457.0,"Do you not hear yourself. You don’t dispute the fact that they are alive and sentient. You claim “well yeah they might be human and aware, but I don’t want it so let’s kill it” that is morbid and disturbing. I don’t even think some pro choicers can get behind that"
Abortiondebate,foozraq,t1_fomy2jg,1587949929.0,"So your saying it’s human and yet your still condoning killing it. Your not making the argument that it’s not alive which I can respect. Your making the argument, yes I agree it’s alive and human but let’s kill it anyway. That is kinda disturbing."
Abortiondebate,folnpjg,t1_folj43n,1587866255.0,Well I assume your referring to link one which stated that a fetus could feel pain after about 23 weeks
Abortiondebate,folihq3,t1_fokir9x,1587862947.0,Yeah I know some say 20 weeks but the capacity to process pain is there at 8 weeks
Abortiondebate,folidy1,t1_fokkxgz,1587862882.0,Prove to me right now that a fetus isn’t sentient and I will agree with you that abortion isn’t murder
Abortiondebate,fokbut5,t1_fojen7z,1587839161.0,So your saying a fetus isn’t human at 4 and a half months? So if it doesn’t have human rights does that mean I can torture it? If it’s not human than it’s not inhumane.
Abortiondebate,fohsmql,t1_fohrpnd,1587771858.0,[link 1](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.livescience.com/amp/54774-fetal-pain-anesthesia.html) [link 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1440624/) [link 3](https://journals.lww.com/neurotodayonline/Fulltext/2006/01170/When_Does_A_Fetus_Feel_Pain_.3.aspx) I could go on but I’m watching a movie and I really can’t be bothered
Abortiondebate,fohra6z,t1_fog2njh,1587771123.0,First of all I’m laughing so hard at the idea that grass can feel pain thanks for that. When is a fetus human when is it classified as human. Because after 2 months the fetus is pretty developed. After 8 weeks a fetus can feel and process pain. Your post is very weird. At the beginning to said just because a fetus can feel pain doesn’t make it human. Then you say I haven’t proved that a fetus can prove pain. I don’t prove it. I let the doctors and studies prove it.
Abortiondebate,fofy2vu,t1_fof6qcp,1587744825.0,Does a fetus have the right to their own bodies. Even if you want to say it’s not a real person it will be. She knew the risks when she consented. Are fetuses entitled to basic human rights? (That’s an actual question)
Abortiondebate,fofqftc,t1_fof6qcp,1587740980.0,"You literally restated my point. In the post I said the argument is that sex isn’t a crime and I agree but it has risks that you know of when you participate in it. Let me ask you something, if humans had invented time travel and you were sitting on the couch around your tween or teen years. Your mom walks in and says you’ve been a huge burden and without you my life would be better. She then says I’m going to have an abortion and time travels back 15 years or something. How would you feel?"
Abortiondebate,fofovmx,t1_foesbou,1587740178.0,"It’s human, it will be human, after a few weeks it can feel pain, has a nervous system, has a brain, has organs. Does a human, or human to be, need to be killed because you couldn’t take a pill or put some rubber on? And yes it’s sad when someone is raped and gets pregnant. No ones denying that, and a feel for them really, but that fetus has done nothing wrong."
Abortiondebate,foernb7,t1_fnwgmv8,1587712422.0,Yeah but ai disagree that pregnant people know when it’s proper to stop a child being brought into this world.
Abortiondebate,foerlmt,t1_fnwo9dg,1587712378.0,"1 week after a fertilization the nervous system starts to form
2 weeks after a babies heart begins to beat
and a babies brain begins to develop
 Only a few weeks after a baby is conceived there’s already a nervous system, brain, heart and other organs I didn’t mention. Fetuses can feel pain by week 8 (some studies disagree I didn’t really look into it I’ll admit) A baby can process emotion. Fetuses can also feel emotions, mostly their mothers emotion though. Babies are very much alive before the third trimester."
Abortiondebate,foeqmq6,t1_fo8zcaf,1587711471.0,"Yeah but you engaged in an act that you knew could create a human life. Essentially it’s putting a revolver to your head with one billed in the chamber. Except instead when you land on the bullet instead of killing you, you have to put another revolver to your head to see what happens to you because of the baby you accidentally created. If I commit murder in a state that has the death penalty, I’m baking of the fact that I won’t get caught, and if I do, that they won’t kill me. I knew the was a risk and that their could be consequences for my actions. And by our justice system I must face the consequences. On the same way a couple is taking a risk when having intercourse, and if the women gets pregnant they must face the consequences of their actions. And I know the argument is that sex isn’t a crime, but you can’t just say well sucks I got pregnant I want a do over land kill the fetus. Even if it’s not classified as alive it will be."
Abortiondebate,foeq1ff,t3_g61gi3,1587710932.0,"But what about the fetus. They have a right to exist. Just because it’s unborn is it to excluded from the same liberties as anyone else. Your argument is a two way street. For example if you could see the future with 100% accuracy and you saw a murder. Luckily though you stopped it. The murder was still going to happen but you stopped it from happening. You could also say they never committed the crime. You’ll never have it one way without the other. You have to look at it from the point of view of the future. That child is going to grow up and have friends and have fun, and stopping it from having those experiences is just as Inhumane if not worse that have it aborted. (Ps mobile so grammar and I rambled a little)"
Abortiondebate,foepfou,t3_g6tgxn,1587710385.0,I get where your coming from and forgive me if I’m not understanding something correctly but to me your argument boils down to murder is illegal and abortion is not so abortion is not murder. The whole point of the argument is to prove the abortion is murder
