TTC_PCOS,fnm6kjy,t1_fnm3bic,1587065976.0,It varied depending on where I was in my cycle but towards the end of the cycle it would be like a 8 on a 1-10 scale. Lots of ibuprofen and heating pads on those days. It would also hurt sleeping on that side.

You shouldn‚Äôt have to drop whatever you‚Äôre doing for an unknown amount of time when his phone rings. You‚Äôve offered a compromise and he still won‚Äôt listen. This is a red flag that could get way worse down the line. What happens if they come to visit him? Will you have to go stay somewhere else then? You shouldn‚Äôt be put out of your own house....

Also, The ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt deserve you‚Äù feels like his way of saying ‚ÄúI know I‚Äôm wrong, but I‚Äôm still continuing to do it anyway because im still getting away with it‚Äù The fact that he is still talking to her proves that..... here a few tips from someone who has been down this road before:

1) do not make any big decisions right now, such as buying a house. 
2) put your foot down. set your boundaries and determine what happens if those boundaries continue to be broken. Very clearly Communicate this to him.  
3) be ready and willing to stick up for yourself and enforce #2. 
4) marriage counseling. - if he is not willing to go, then he is not invested in trying to fix your marriage."

TryingForABaby,f8dnd5s,t3_e0b34m,1574499906.0,This must be so upsetting.

Endo,ewiahzs,t3_cohvnp,1565444068.0,"Hi there. So I had (and still sometimes have) this problem with my mother. It‚Äôs not like a broken leg that they can see- so sometimes it‚Äôs hard for people to even try to comprehend what‚Äôs going on with you when it‚Äôs not staring them in the face. 

With that said- it‚Äôs not okay for someone to treat you like that. In her case- she really doesn‚Äôt have any idea what‚Äôs going on because like you said- you haven‚Äôt told her. It‚Äôs completely up to you how much you share, but I found it helpful to sit down and go over everything in detail that I feel during the day to try and make my mom understand that even though I look fine,  I have good and bad days and there are things I can and can‚Äôt do. I stressed that I needed to set my own limits and not push myself every single day- and told her what happens when I do. Did this make things perfect? Absolutely not. But I do remind her every time she says something or makes comments about it that I have a condition and it effects me daily. It sounds like the ‚Äúpoor me‚Äôs‚Äù to my mom all the time- but I‚Äôm sticking up for myself and continuing to do what‚Äôs best for me. 

Don‚Äôt let anyone run your life for you or do anything that‚Äôs going to push you to the point where you are in agony. Your boyfriend should also help you out with the conversation and show his mother that he is supportive of you and that that is a much better approach than her nagging. She may just be trying to help in her eyes, but it‚Äôs causing you unnecessary stress."

I know everyone is  different but my weight def. seems to be related to when I see it popping back up the most. Have you seen an endocrinologist to have hormones  checked?
PCOS,etz7khn,t3_ce41r5,1563328002.0,"Started with electrolysis- switched to laser. Honestly it took me about 5 years of aggressive treatment because mine was so bad.

(Endo here too). 

Also, I was overweight and while it was hard to lose weight (and still is) it seems to help my hormones and I have less hair growth when I weight less. (This is just my experience, I know a lot of people have difficult with pcos and weight but I‚Äôm not making any type of assumptions, just offering what helped me).

I also have the palpitations even though I am on a beta blocker. My cardiologist and I worked together to find the right dose and it took months of trial and error. Too little made the palpitations worse, and too much also made them worse. I still get them daily, but only a few compared to getting them hourly. 

A lot is also anxiety induced for me. I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs the cause for you, but it was something that I refused to accept for a while until I started journaling and realizing that they would get worse the week before large social events. If you‚Äôre willing, I would maybe try relaxation techniques, journaling, and possibly seeing a therapist. POTS is still a huge factor, and my anxiety only makes them worse."

We tried to go up to 50mg but I couldn‚Äôt function, brain was foggy, And I was completely exhausted and weak. I feel like beta blockers do make some POTS symptoms worse in some ways, you need to decide wether the side effects are worth it for you and everyone is different. For me it is worth it- yes I have to take naps daily in the afternoon and some days I am still weak and exhausted, but my heart rate is normal most days and that makes it worth it so that I can have a somewhat normal day. I also don‚Äôt feel super dizzy all the time anymore. 

Hang with it at least for a few weeks while your body adjusts. Starting it is the worst because it really slows down the heart, which in turn kind of slows down everything else. What you are feeling is normal for starting a beta blocker, but always know you can reach out to your doctor with concerns and questions (I bugged mine a lot when I first started my beta blocker)"
