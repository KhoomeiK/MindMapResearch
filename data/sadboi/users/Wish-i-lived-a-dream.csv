depression,fa1r2gg,t3_e7nwdu,1575773319.0,"In my opinion it will always be easier to smile about being happy than to show your true feelings and emotions. So that no one will ask you what's wrong when you know they really don't care. 

Also I'd like to believe that maybe if I faked being happy and smiled at everyone, that I could actually feel happier, because they say ""fake it till you make it"". But usually I end up still being depressed or dull, even though people tell me I'm always happy and I smile alot."
depression,f9z4yap,t3_e7aagu,1575738139.0,"I have one friend that I talk to about my depression and the things I feel or go through. But everytime I message them to vent or talk to, I always feel like I'm asking for attention by saying like hey can we talk or I need someone to talk to.

They always say that it doesn't make me look like an attention seeker, but in the back of my head that's all I can see myself as. A person who seeks attention because of my depression, even though I just need someone to talk to.
 
And even though I'm beyond grateful for that friend, I'm starting to feel super dependent on them. Like I feel the need to message them always on any issue that I'm going through, which I'm scared that it would put a strain on our friendship.


I feel like once you find someone that you trust and they trust you or someone that opens up to you, then you might be able to share your depression. But I know and always believed that sharing your depression doesn't make you an attention seeker, it makes you a strong person ‚ù§Ô∏è"

That need to be comforted by someone that loves you would be nice.  A shoulder to lean on and a friend to hug someone tight is something I want too. I really hope you find someone like that, stay strong üíõ"

Hopefully something or someone enters your life and changes your perspective on things, cause that's what I'm hoping for. But untill then, all we can do is look straight ahead and continue to live. We all deserve a good life, love and happiness. I hope you find something that makes you wanna keep going."

School, friends and my parents always stress me out and it is exhausting. It will be hard to go to school, but you'll be heading in the right direction! I believe things will work out for you and hope good things come your way!"

depression,f9sl30u,t1_f9sjuvt,1575594454.0,"I understand the struggle, I wouldn't ""hate"" you cause you aren't going to school, but I would encourage you go to school. Cause as much as I dread it and hate it, I know it'll hurt me more to skip class.

The way we are taught to learn and the way they test us is all bs. Tests and grades don't define our intelligence or our potential!! It should change. 

Other than that, my social life been wack. I've been feeling distant from my friends and I suck at making new friends. I'm grateful for my friends, but sometimes I wish I had a more diverse group of friends, that is separate from my friend group right now. But idk if it's a bad thing that I'm thinking like that..."

I guess cause no one really knows what you think or what you feel. I feel empty and insignificant when I feel alone. I guess untill you find a partner in life, then hopefully you'll feel less alone, other than that you are truely alone in my opinion."
