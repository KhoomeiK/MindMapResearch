medical,f08w7qh,t3_d49n8x,1568489133.0,"22 F in Australia. Obese and smoker. 
Chest pain for nearly 4 weeks, over the past week it has changed to severe pain (think 6-8/10 tearing/stabbing pain) on exertion, chest pain at rest is around a 3-4 and is dull but tight, shortness of breath on exertion and tachycardia up to 150bpm on exertion. I've also started to feel pre-syncopal on exertion. 

ECGs and troponin levels non remarkable. 

Extensive abdominal history include appendectomy, gastric sleeve, gallbladder removal, adhesions in both pelvic and abdominal areas and ovarian cyst removal. 

Taking regular 40mg nexium BD, paracetamol with codeine roughly TDS and oxycodone 10mg PRN. 

Strong maternal history of cardiomyopathies and cardiac arrests at young age but I believe recent echocardiogram was NAD.

Any suggestions to what could be causing my pain would be appreciated. At a standstill with my GP at the moment. 

Thank you!"

My mum had a very severe cardiac history (first cardiac arrest at 21) so I just be cautious with chest pain. I'm pretty much 100% sure my pain is gastro related as I have a complex abdominal pain history but better to be safe than sorry as my doctors say haha. 

Thanks again! :)"

nursing,ewlt0gw,t3_colul0,1565535093.0,"I work in an acute ward. I was previously an AIN in a nursing home (CNA equivalent I believe if I was in America). Physically, being a psych RN is piss-easy. But emotionally and mentally it's exhausting. Some days are cruisy as, but other days I've broke down before the end of a shift. Vicarious trauma is a real thing. And also, getting abused and screamed at for 8 hours straight isn't my idea of fun. 

That being said, I love my job and I love my patients. Well, most of them."

Yes, she was being a pain beforehand and you had every right to step back and stop helping then (it was falling in deaf ears anyway), but once she cut herself, you could've been the better person and at least offered to help."

AskDocs,eurd9db,t3_chb31d,1563992633.0,"NAD but a mental health professional. 
If I was assessing you, and this is what you told me, I would said you had no psychotic features. 

I would however, say you displayed some cluster b and cluster c personality traits. In my field I am allowed to say that, but I am not allowed to diagnose. 

This seems, from my perspective, all anxiety based. 
Regardless, I'm sure it is a very terrifying time for you. Anxiety is dreadful. You should continue to reach out and seek help/therapy."

Also has there been anything like this happen before, or perhaps a traumatic event that's happened in the past that's underlying in your subconscious? I only ask because I go through the same sort of periods - get very emotional and I find personally, I have to dig around in my head and I eventually find a trigger. 

You've made an excellent step by starting therapy and meditating. Maybe have a Google of other self care options and give some of them a try to see if it helps as well. 

Things will get better."
