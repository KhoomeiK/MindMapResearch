I am a woman, so I can’t even fathom the complexities of how difficult and horrific your experience was for you. But this past summer, I was also raped. It happened while my best friend was in the room. She thought I had a “fun night” with my rapist and she was borderline excited to hear what happened because she had been wanting to hook up with his best friend all night when we went out and she thought that naturally he and I should get along. I’ve never had the heart to tell her that he raped me. 

It’s hard for anyone who is not you in such a situation to completely comprehend the effects of that sort of thing. It seems like your girlfriend was also traumatized and is trying her best for you, but don’t hold your breath for her to know what it was truly like. Maybe you don’t even want her to know. But if you know her heart is in the right place, and that she wants to support you, it can make the situation a little less shitty. That being said, it is never on you to speak about your assault in any way. Say what you want, when you want to - how she or anyone else chooses to perceive you is on them and not you. I hope you get the justice and peace you deserve."
