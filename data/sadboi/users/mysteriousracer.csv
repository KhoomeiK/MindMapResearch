depression,f02dzi8,t3_d3fdem,1568328601.0,"I understand. I was in a really bad place earlier this year. Ive been trying to improve and considering where my mind was, I can say I’m doing better.  Then I just get hit with a wave of depression and it totally knocks everything out of me. Then I question if I am actually doing better or if I’m just getting better at tricking myself into thinking I’m ok just to get some reprieve.

It’s just a reminder that no matter what your situation is, you’re not immune to feeling depressed. Whether you have a life filled with positive things, or a life that’s currently filled with misfortunes, each persons depression is just as valid as the next persons. I hope one day I can finally beat depression for good, so until then I guess I have no choice but to keep fighting. I hope you continue to fight as well. You’re not alone."
depression,f02c98k,t3_cpvwhh,1568327697.0,"I wake up, I go to work. I try to be social and smile and joke with my coworkers. For most of the day while I’m distracted my feelings of depression are alleviated, but they’re still there. Then there’s those moments throughout the day where I’m not talking to people or have a moment to myself, I can feel myself drop the “act” that I feel like I’ve been putting on. I feel like I’m fighting and pushing away my depression all day and it’s exhausting. I go home and let myself sink into that dark and familiar place. I hate going there but there’s something comforting about it. It doesn’t feel like I’m going uphill anymore. When I’m there I don’t have to fight. After acting all day it’s in that moment where I feel like I can finally stop and be myself, as fucked up as that sounds."
careerguidance,f029l17,t1_ezyn82h,1568326221.0,"I’d like to think that he’s not doing it intentionally and maybe he is just genuinely forgetting to send me. I really don’t know. I don’t live in a recreational state, unfortunately. I agree that it’s not worth it, i haven’t smoked in over 3 months and I don’t plan on doing it until I know what’s going on. It’s just really frustrating that he talks about weed like it’s not a big deal, mentions that he uses it from time to time, and says that he respects people doing what they want in their own time, but sort of keeping his thumb down on my personal life by not sending me.

We also hired a new guy who had worked for my boss years ago. He’s probably just going to remain a part time employee because he’s not really willing to do all of the work we do. So my boss has him work less hours during the week than I do. The new guy openly admits to smoking weed, and admits that he’s not willing/able to stop long enough to pass a test. So then it raises the question, does my boss actually have a drug testing policy in place? If I just decide I wanna smoke weed can I just tell my boss that I’m not going to take a drug test and continue to smoke weed and not have any repercussions? Theres’s just no line in the sand and it’s driving me crazy."
careerguidance,f028n5a,t1_f01fjta,1568325647.0,"When I first started I was told it would be a saliva test. When he was talking to his staffing people he asked about sending me for a drug test, and they said that it was up to him, but if he chose to send me at the time I would have to take a pee test. Considering I had smoked a month prior, he told me that he wouldn’t send me just yet because he wanted to make sure I was clean. Which, I admit, is pretty cool that he had my back even though I’m confident I would’ve passed. I’ve passed a drug test before after 10 days of not smoking, with no cleansers. I’m thin and I have a fast metabolism and drink lots of water.

Each time after that when the test got brought up he said it would be a saliva test. So I’m assuming it’s most likely going to be a saliva test, but even if it was a pee test I’m pretty certain I could pass that now. I’m not going to say that his insurance people “don’t care” if I smoke weed, it’s not like they’re pressuring him to test me, but I’m pretty sure that he gets a better rate on his insurance or something if he does drug test his employees. I think it only has to be once and doesn’t require random tests. If I were to get hurt at work or have an accident then I’d probably get sent for a drug test again.

Like I said, I know people probably think I’m making a big deal about something that’s not a big deal. But I like to smoke weed, it helps with my anxiety, it’s fun, and I think that if can pass a drug test and I’m still performing well at work then I should be able to do what I want in my personal time.  My boss has alluded to it not being something that concerns him as long as I can pass the initial drug test and don’t come to work under the influence. If it turns out that it’s not something that he’s ok with, or he wants me to take random tests (which again, I don’t think that’s something he wants to do), then I’ll at least be able to know where I stand with weed at this job. But him telling me that I’m going to need to take a test and not sending me for one it feels like I don’t have any control over my personal life. It feels like it’s hanging over my head and I don’t like that."
depression,eyxr01t,t1_eyxohgm,1567560342.0,"We really are in this together, and knowing that other people feel how I feel and still push through makes me feel not so alone. I hope that you feel the same way.  There’s people that will miss you if you’re not around. Even people who don’t know you. The thought of anyone ending their life because they feel hopeless or worthless breaks my heart. Being a human is an intense and crazy ride. I hope you decide to keep going, we all need you here to experience the highs and lows with us."
