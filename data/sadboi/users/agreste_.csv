AskDID,fkgpf9l,t3_fidp4d,1584168195.0,"We're a DID system who was diagnosed early 2019.

We haven't seen Trisha's videos, we've only seen reaction videos and clips from it. It's like a slap in the face for this to come out after Anthony Padilla's fantastic and informative interview. In our opinion, it is not about whether or not Trisha has DID or not. What matters is how she hurt the community and spread misinformation about an already overwhelmingly stigmatized disorder.

Something that Trisha implied in her first video was that alters exist to serve the host. This is not true in any way. Alters are their own individuals and they deserve the same amount of respect as anyone. They're not here to 'serve' anyone. The way she talked about her, what she's calling them, alters was so heartbreaking. No one, especially someone who went through so much to protect you and the rest of your system, deserves to be talked about like that. The host is not the ""owner"" of the system either. No one has more or less rights to the body. Being apart of one whole and sharing the brain, every alter has a right to exist.

It's one thing to be a troll and it's another thing to hurt marginalized communities. DID, a childhood trauma disorder, is not in any way something that should be used for clout. It is not a trend nor is it an easy thing to live with. However, DID systems can lead successful and fulfilling lives.

Dissociative identity disorder is not just about having alters. It's a childhood trauma disorder, meaning there's going to be things such as dissociation, flashbacks, nightmares, panic attacks, body memories, and so much more. DID is not fun to live with. DID is not having ""friends"" all around all the time. A lot of us, in our system, don't like each other but we still try our best to get along with one another. We work very hard to make our life work and to cope with what we've been through. To see someone who has a very large platform spread such horrible misinformation about something that forms due to the suffering of innocent children is beyond hurtful.

There's so much support for the DID community right now. We've seen so many people being supportive, kind, and respectful to DID systems. So many people are trying to learn the truth about what DID is and what DID isn't. That's one of the best outcomes that could've come out of this. It makes us grateful to see people standing for, and with, our community. Thank you to any singlet who is learning the right information about dissociative identity disorder. It means a lot that you're trying to understand DID. To any other systems, y'all are so incredibly important, loved, and valuable. Especially ones who are discovering they're a system amongst all of this."
