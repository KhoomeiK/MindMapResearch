depression,fg54ak4,t3_enrs4c,1580517913.0,I know I have depression and I'm possibly bipolar but once I heard that I left the shrink and never went back. I don't talk to anyone about it cause it seems everyone elses problems are worse/more important. My family thinks I'm joking or just aggravated when I say I want to die but I can't just correct them cause they just tell me to shut up. I'm tired of fighting... But too stubborn to give in.
