PoliticalCompassMemes,fr37bc9,t1_fr34v3a,1589851397.0,"Fairly permanent. That is a key factor. Races are far from being fairly permanent in regards to isolation. It takes a long time to get significant variation. Keep in mind: If you want the most isolationist perspective, compare the America's to the other half of the world pre-colonialism. For such a significant increase in isolation, we still have very little variation even compared to those African tribes.

People based it on visual queues, not through a predefined definition.

Races do not exist from any objective standpoint. In a coloquial sense it does. They do not exist from any scientific perspective, the only reason they are used is due to a presupposition of them existing, we then retroactively make criteria through trying to find differences, not for a specific reason, but to attempt to legitimize our presupposition.

I am saying this from not a cultural perspective, but a scientific one. You can find genetic variation, but not one that is significant. This isn't for some kind of woke leftist perspective.

Yes, intelligence is determined by genetics, but show us that this is defined by race without confounding variables as shown through studies that have passed significant peer review."
Advice,fr33red,t1_fr2w315,1589849347.0,"So suppressing them?

Emotions don't go away, you engage in them so you can move on.

Suppressing them causes subconscious issues as well as harming your ability to engage in them when necessary. When you reconcile emotions on the spot you will never dwell on them, you will handle the extremes far easier, and you will avoid excess stress and pain.

Emotions never just go away on their own, think back onto any event you suppressed emotions on and you will find that they come up. That event? It has imprinted itself onto you, if you reconcile it then the event will either not bring up emotions or will become far more tolerable in extreme cases such as trauma.

Cognitive behavioral therapy has demonstrated this very well"

What about those variations change how we function in any significant way? They are very, very minor.

Intelligence has never been demonstrated to relate to race directly. No peer reviewed study has ever been able to show this, there have never been any studies that have been done that demonstrate a difference all while removing confounding variables, thus none have been able to stand up to peer review. All have been discredited.

Give me a way for us to define races and to find new ones.

Are you saying that we should have hundreds of new races among the African Tribes? There is no definition that can be made which will be able to distinguish races in such a way that is consistent with those that were predefined.

Those races? People made them up well before there was any objective measure. We then retroactively searched for variations genetically, we did not do it the other way around. We had a presupposition that races existed and we sought a way to confirm said presupposition. We do not have a way to even define new races, if we did then you could give me the details as to how we would do so."

Those 8 traits are ARBITRARY. They aren't based on any sound logic, so much of it is either aesthetic or relating to melanin and sun cancer, neither are a trait that would distinguish species whatsoever. So why would we choose so for race?

They were defined through in and out groups, this led to groups isolating, this is why we can find 8 traits. However: None are that significant whatsoever, if you are on a blank slate for humans as a species you would not find any reason to categorize us, we are all too similar. We don't even have significantly different functions like you would see in cases of breeding. The isolation of groups was so insignificant that we see more genetic variety by a mile between African tribes versus every one of us. Every ""race""? Combined genetic variety of ALL RACES doesn't even compare. That is how insignificant we are compared to them."

Though it took about 6 trips to eventually break down them all. It was so, so painful. I felt like I was that child again, experiencing everything over and over again. I WAS there. But this made me realize the potential for shrooms was so much more.

Before I get onto DMT, I did many trips I didnt cover. LSD was able to unlock trauma of early childhood bullying (was extremely bad, I have autism, adhd-c, ocd, GAD.) Where I was constantly a target for being physically attacked. Constsnt. At the end of a LSD trip I felt the most visceral fear of my life, it took the entire day, going into night, while with my friend to break through that fear and feel everything. An hour of work up for two hours of constantly speaking my heart out. This was before the shroom trip but I feel for understanding it fits better.

The last 2 4aco rips were the most significant and the most... well, you'll understand. That first 4ACO trip was 50mg, I am confident with psychs and a week later did 100mg (80 with tolerance), 3 days later I was at my mental breaking point and took 400+mg. 200 in a pill and at least 200 snorted, likely more.

The first one I found myself in my memories. I WAS there, it was real. Like a waking dream. I was that child. The trauma I had was exaggerated into what I saw, i.e. I was raped and threatened with a gun at 4 years old to kill my mother and I if I told. The mother, her oldest son, and her boyfriend were all involved, this manifested in a gunfight where my mother and I were targeted and nearly killed. The mother had whipped me badly with a cat o'nine tails so I saw her as a fucking psychopath and she was the one who tried to kill us despite the boyfriend showing me the gun. My trauma was exaggerated, it manifested itself in a way I could see. I thought it was all genuinely real. I cannot describe how strong it was. I felt like I was healed in a sense, but not I began to deteriorate soon after. It wasnt real so my brain didn't heal. So i acted out of desperation.

That next trip wasnt as strong as you may think with that tolerance, though still very strong. I dived into my memories, unsure of the truth, scenarios played out. Exaggerated ones. But i knew they were exaggerated, I scrutinized them, I fought my mind like hell until it went closer and closer to reality. I was becoming that child and then... broke. I got the truth, but I couldnt process it all. I thought I did, but I didn't in reality.

Thursday night: Had xanax with 2 friends. Had my first ever psychotic break, delirious, full blown psychosis. Ate 26 2mg bars that night. I remember a fair bit, but it was like my entire mind was shattering and I was breaking. It is impossible to describe.

Finally: Last night/this morning. I recently got a glass vapor genie, I knew I had to face my demons. I got the bit of DMT I had left. I meditated long beforehand, remembered all that I could and prepared myself. I bever broke through, but I didnt need to. The DMT world was meaningless, but it began to shatter my mind. I heard voices, parts of me I refused to accept, things that disturbed me, made me feel... a way I can't describe. I was breaking into new personalities. For hours between hits I would repeat over and over ""This is not me, this isn't me! Don't show me this!"" Followed by ""But this is you, this is me."" The DMT felt like it shattered me but I was able to reform myself.

Today I feel revived, I can't describe it really. I feel normal, but reality s different. I broke through everything, I can truly exert myself, enjoy things, move forward. I don't need to think back to it. So much more happened than I described in these 5 months. I am too exhausted to be giddy about it, but it is over. There will still be work of course, but all of this? I am moving past it.

I have a extremely strong will and mind. This isnt boasting. I am very smart. But yet I went through all of that. This isn't a joke. Be careful. These are very, very powerful, don't rush this. You have time. Don't ruin your chances to heal through rushing it. It will be worth it. 

I have heroin, tar, coming in the mail. I am going to be careful of addiction, but I got a former addict and narcan, sometimes you need a break. I need it. So does my friend. We've earned it. But never stop being cautious.

I really hope this helped."

4acodmt,fq4fod9,t1_fq3outa,1589077160.0,"It really is. This is EXTREMELY long, I think you will find massive value in it. Will have to make a comment chain due to character limits.

I genuinely try not to boast, but I am extremely smart when applied. 9 years of therapy, now 22. I fell in love with psychology and learned it deeply. I couldnt fix all of my issues on my own or with my therapist, I had hellish trauma, literally my entire childhood. Along with a horrific experience I only just now found out, I made a post of it on reddit i believe. None of this is exclusive to trauma but it is my experience with it.

Ive used these for therapy: Shrooms, LSD, MDMA, DMT, and even Heroin.

This is what I have gathered from my experience, most of these were with a friend who had a similar past in terms of damage. We began this on new years with MDMA, we've taken back our lives by now. I dont recommend all of these, find your own path.

MDMA allows you to unearth and experience surface level traumas. Trauma that aren't entirely repressed, but are subconsciously avoided. It allows you to fully experience the emotions, however they aren't 'bad'. Best way I can put it: Imagine if Pain was still pain but in your mind it is neither good nor bad. It just is. But that 'pain' is just as visceral and just as real as it ever was. This opens up your memories a lot. This is where to start, it is the safest by a mile. Start with this if anything. It gives you skills for later along with a starting point on where to go next.

LSD I did next, it was a punch in the gut. All of those emotions you felt? Increase your ability to remember and multiply the emotions by 10. It is visceral and it is painful as hell. But in all of this- the way you heal is through experiencing your emotions, you can't hide from shit. Your brain naturally heals, but you have to remember and understand. Understand it correctly, not just believe you do. LSD allows you to feel the emotions you unlocked from MDMA, but it beats the fuck out of you. You need to feel those emotions.

Heroin was next, was intending to use it as an escape with my friend, we were so fucking exhausted. We needed some rest. But it gave us time to think, talk, understand. It was painful, but it was easy. This wasn't injected, you have to be semi-sober with it."
4acodmt,fq3c12b,t1_fq2zwjv,1589064954.0,"For therapy.

If you rely on drugs for therapeutic purposes then you wont get past the full extent of your issues.

Ill be honest, doing the sober work scares me more. Because you have to fight for it, not take a drug and be thrown into the experince.

Ive found a good mix of drugs/sober, but it is something you"
4acodmt,fq2zdex,t1_fq2tf3o,1589061593.0,"4aco/shrooms has infinite possibilities compared to many other psychs, same for DMT. 

Show shrooms and 4aco respect, they can be really traumatizing. They also cannot be used exclusively.

But comparing it to lsd? Lsd is like a filter. 4aco is a new world."
energy_work,fpmu28s,t3_gecwnx,1588741738.0,"You are. It is unique to everyone.

I specifically see and feel the energy. I move it from my body into my arms, then compress it into my hands. From that point I make my energy circulate, almost like a magnetic field or a water current. I then focus it into my palms and have the energy connect, once it connects I move inwards and condense it into and orb. I slowly contract and expand and feel the magnetic force grow.

I havent put emotion into it yet."
energy_work,fpmtdyn,t3_geaj5y,1588741217.0,"So I have a similar effect, I see both aura and directly feel energy. In a very literally sense, my physical sensations and not third eye interpretations.

Question: What does it feel like. For me it feels like a flow from my body, into my arm, which compresses. As I manipulate it, usually by causing it to spin, it becomes stronger. For me specifically it is a sense of magnetism.

I am still very new but learning quickly. I can get it to the point it is extremely difficult to even move my hands. 

Is your experience anything like that?"
aspergers,fpm2hxi,t3_gdzicv,1588724225.0,"This is something that takes time.

I am 22. Autism. ADHD. OCD. Bipolar, PTSD that was building onto itself ages 4-18ish.

This is something that takes time. Ages 11-17 were sheer depression, every single night I was like your son.

It takes action to move past it, your treat the symptoms of autism first through therapy, preferably CBT with someone who has sufficient experience.

I also HIGHLY recommend looking into potential mental illnesses paired with Autism. It is extremely common for those with autism to be paired with other mental illnesses.

It starts with understanding emotions, controlling them and seeing it in others. For reference, pre-treatment every face I saw looked exactly the same. Then you move into social interactions. I remember the only way I could start a convo was through special interests, it took years to break through that.

Find passions, build his personality from the feameworks he does have.

None of this is easy, and after so much pain it is even more difficult to jump into more pain. It takes practice.

There is many different paths that can be taken, but #1 is test for other illnesses, #2 is CBT."

spirituality,fpl8m07,t1_fpkywjc,1588708293.0,"Lol very true. Falling asleep is always so god damn difficult. My adderall helps a fair bit but only so much.

Funnily enough, the better my mental health is the worst the OCD is. I recently had the biggest breakthrough of my life and the OCD is coming back with a vengeance.

Meditation exercises can definitely help with some practice, for me I find the best way to avoid OCD is energy work. Though I am a bit lucky in that sense, energy work is extremely active for me since I literally feel it and see it, so that tends to distract me enough. Even more useful is that channeling is something that I do with it.

The reason I say all that is to give you some inspiration into ways to counter the issue. You can do clearheaded meditation while still doing certain forms of work, it just takes a bit of practice. This has been the best result for me."
mentalhealth,fpl2a4g,t3_ge1dz0,1588705104.0,"It was horrific.

The book was great, the girl was NOT painted in a good light, it was a story where she may have been pushed over the edge due to others, but she put blame onto many, some that was very justified and others less so.

Just know, I havent read the book for 7 years now, but the little I saw from the show and the subsequent reviews- it ROMANTICIZED SUICIDE.

Look, if you are put into a situation such as her, you are generally not at fault whatsoever. But you cannot expect others to act for you. You are responsible for yourself, if you are unwilling to act for yourself, fight for yourself, then you can't expect others to do so.

The show should have done this: 1 prequel, where she was alive. Then her subsequent death. Afterwords they should have never shown her again: That is what death is. One second a live, breathing human with millions of memories- the next they are gone, no redo's. They are gone. 

Sure, it is more difficult to make a compelling narrative- but writing isn't easy, and the final product should not be one that is so god damn harmful and shows the complete opposite of what the message should be."

Tbh I wouldnt mind doing it if it wasn't for my ADHD and OCD.

Mind racing and basically forcing you into not being able to sleep? Shut it the hell up with some post-nut clarity.

Though, I probably should try something such as a month. See how it goes, even with a few nights that may be more difficult to sleep, it might still be a net positive."
DecidingToBeBetter,fpj62gy,t1_fpj3c9j,1588657663.0,"Its a meme.

Due to the sheer number of individualistic characteristics to porn addiction you practically see every one having different benefits.

Cocaine generally has very consistent symptoms with addiction since it just affects your brain directly. 

With that in mind, thats why people say superpowers: Because it practically looks like every single thing in everyone's life improves based on the individual anecdotes adding up."
