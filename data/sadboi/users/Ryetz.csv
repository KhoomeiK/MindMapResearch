If you're not convinced, [The Gyakuten Saiban Saga has always been a VN title](https://vndb.org/r60512), A lot of it has. If you're also curious about Dangan Ronpa (if you know this title), [they are also as well a VN title](https://vndb.org/v7014).

Remember it is Classified as a VN if it presents more Contextual Text than the actual Gameplay, Pheonix Wright, and Dangan Ronpa never strayed away from that genre.

VNs can vary from more than 2 Endings be it bad or good. Best I've seen was around 21, but some unreleased to the west would most likely have more.

Though I may not know exactly how many endings this current VN has, but if it doesn't. It's most likely a Kinetic Novel (meaning no choices or choices that only lead to only one ending)."

Considering that you either mix/match your armor sets to fulfill your comfortable playstyle, or switching weapons based on what you feel. The Loot grind aspect of it is sort of second nature that you barely even notice it.

Been playing for almost a decade, and this has really nailed the balance of neutralizing the tediousness in grinding and making it fun instead.

If you think you'll be overwhelmed, please do not hesitate to ask questions on the subreddit or in the MH community discord groups, Vets are always glad to help out on new hunters.

As for your last questions:

1. Considering back then the price of the game was around 30-40 usd (each) this is a total steal!
2. Oh, I guess I answered it up top. **TL;DR**: Monsters are memorable, Combat is not just mash X button to kill and you have to strategize, No complicated stat leveling system, Each Weapon Feels like a new different gameplay, Armor Skills Expands it even further, And you can technically be naked (no armor) and still hunt down a monster, it's all skill."

MonsterHunter,fkdyaj7,t1_fkdwjbg,1584099783.0,"I remember being fresh in IB and once I got my Guard 5, Offensive Guard (courtesy of banbaro), I was set until I got to elders.

The very basic bread and butter combo for the lance is your usual 3 Pokes then counter, rinse and repeat. But my version is more of a 3 Poke then Advance Guard anywhere, rinse and repeat. Side stepping is faster too if the monster is down at least.

3 Poke combo is good, but fairly risky among faster and aggressive monsters.  Doing 1-2 Pokes then a Counter or Advance Guard can literally save your butt, I learned that the hard way. The 3rd poke doesn't give you enough time to let out another Counter/Adv Guard, so be wary if you want a full output on your poking. You hit more if you aren't on the floor (yes it rhymes).

Oh yeah if you aren't aware, if you back hop while you hold the analog stick back (perpendicular to the character's back), you hop farther than your usual back hops. You can back hop 3 times max, so you can implement that extended back hop in any of the 3 back hops."

And don't forget about Offensive Guard, really goes well with Counter Thrust. Rewards you bonus damage for timing a guard properly, so if you think about it that way, you get rewarded by constantly being in front of the monster's face all the time."
