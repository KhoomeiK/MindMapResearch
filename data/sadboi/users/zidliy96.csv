BPDmemes,fkex4ns,t1_fkevfo6,1584122509.0,I think you got the answer to your problem but it‚Äôs a tough one...
BPDmemes,fkev7l1,t1_fketr38,1584121370.0,"Thank you for clarifying. It‚Äôs really hard sometimes to estimate intentions of others. And the stigma makes some of us more cautious/defensive. (Just some of the reasons why it might come off offensive). It seems to be a complicated situation. Have you talked to her about the ghosting and how that makes you feel like? Also, setting boundaries and following these up is really important. 
I think it is really good to be aware about yourself, is there anyway you could talk to a therapist about it?"
BPDmemes,fkefsv0,t1_fkdr9t8,1584112282.0,"As you can tell your comment might come off offensive to some of us. But if it‚Äôs something you‚Äôre dealing with genuinely; best advice would be to consult a professional. And remember it takes two to tango. Maybe you‚Äôre enabling her behavior. Maybe it is more complicated than pointing at somebody with BPD, because as humans we are biased. BUT ANYWAY, we don‚Äôt know. We don‚Äôt know the intention, situation, you and her. So please consult!!"
BPDmemes,fked0xh,t1_fke8ej1,1584110598.0,I‚Äôve read somewhere that Topamax and Lamictal were most commonly used. But I‚Äôm not sure.
BPDmemes,fkecm1r,t3_fhx9h5,1584110344.0,"Wow, are you guys allowed to take meds? Since I started with DBT they told me to just endure the pain & sleeplessness. Not to numb my emotions and face them. Each country & therapy form has different ways to ‚Äútreat‚Äù BPD I guess. I‚Äôm curious, if anyone wants to share their experience; let me know :)"
BPDmemes,fjj8pss,t3_fdntvu,1583386628.0,"In another BPD post I got harshly invalidated and got words put in my mouth. This was because I made a comment about not having to be rude to OP because of what a struggle it is and being mindful with words is better to anyone really. It triggered memories of the past. I really feel invalidated but I know I got my facts straight as I go to DBT and learn sooooo much. Makes me realize how scary Reddit (or any social media) can be, when not being in therapy with little research/tools. I just wanted to vent... Also because I understand no one is perfect or got it all right but a little kindness and mindfulness goes a long way."
BPD,fjj693t,t1_fa6b9t2,1583384525.0,"Okay so, I had to comment again on this because it has been bothering me and being in therapy and even talking about this, has taught me some precious things. I wanted to share some facts as well as my opinion; ‚ÄúUs older and wiser‚Äù have you had experience with DBT?!! I don‚Äôt feel like you do because you are INVALIDATING. You are judging and prejudiced. Something you learn @DBT not to do. Also there are more truths to anything, what you think is right does not have to be a fact as I feel like you are making it sound like. I agree with changing old patterns to better your life quality. ‚ÄúAnd OP is having a symptom they need to manage. Telling them that isn't harsh, it's helpful.‚Äù I never said such thing nor is it clear to say I did by commenting. I feel like you are taking my words and pulling it to the wrong side. Something along the lines of putting words in somebody‚Äôs mouth. AND THAT is NEVER okay. But what is concerning to me is that people who do not go to DBT and read your comment and feel pressured to think it is the truth... I feel like you come off too aggressively with your opinion. It really is not pleasant. Honestly I felt attacked by how you worded things and my truth felt invalidated because of it. Please people, do your research, stay with the facts. Check out Marsha Linehan on DBT. This comment made me feel like people like me (with BPD) had to suck it up sometimes... and sure we do BUT in a mindful way as well as in our speech, expressing things and so on. Not because a comment makes you feel like you are too much of a borderliner and should just shut up and ‚ÄúFUCKING CHILL‚Äù. You‚Äôll get to understand to use kind words and rephrase your sentence to be more positive and kind to yourself. 
Ps: AND YES I STILL DO FIND THE CONTENT OF THE COMMENT HARSH. BE MINDFUL, ALWAYS! And thank god for the psychologist who taught me that at DBT. Credits to them :). 
Lil disclaimer; no I‚Äôm not perfect either, but damn I‚Äôm trying every SINGLE day."
BPD,fjd7f2o,t1_fjcpgql,1583247380.0,"Me (23F) for example; I go to therapy 2 times a week. And got homework for every single day. Therapy; DBT; for 1 year straight. 
Often people with no (severe) mental health issues, don‚Äôt even know as much as someone who went to therapy. How to handle difficult situations as to emotions, relationships whether it‚Äôs intimate or not. My tip would be; make sure she is willing to commit on changing her ‚Äúbad habits‚Äù by going to therapy. She has to break these ‚Äúlessening of quality of life patterns‚Äù. And trust me, it‚Äôs damn fk hard to change these. Best tip I can give you as someone who‚Äôs in a (challenging) relationship; CONSULT A PSYCHOLOGIST! ( I would suggest someone who gives DBT/ has experience with BPD to not stigmatize or give false information) Get advice, stay sane, get to know yourself better to be able to help your relationship to succeed and even to better yourself. There will always be room for bettering yourself no matter the mental state.  
Also maybe search for DBT Marsha Linehan to get more information about it. 
Good luck!"
AspiePartners,fiwuw6a,t3_fa5hu3,1582804052.0,"I met my aspie partner during a drink at a bar with fellow students who love to game. He was one of the members and soon after I signed up for it too. He always told me that he was missing something and could never put a finger on it, but since he met me it got clear. Loneliness is a b*tch. Main key here is to participate in associations/clubs/hobby‚Äôs etc. and hopefully you‚Äôll meet someone. One more tip would be; focus on your self growth. Before I met him I got this feeling of being ready to get in a relationship... before I never felt this. Eventho I felt ready and considered anything I possibly could, there will be things you can‚Äôt be prepared for. Keeping a NT relationship is already hard work let alone 2 partners with their own mental health conditions. Just my two cents. 
U can do thisü•∞!"

BPD,f782oji,t3_dussmq,1573483632.0,"He can‚Äôt play it on you since he is the one asking if it is okay. So don‚Äôt worry about that. Talk to him how you were scared to show your real emotions. And a 32 year old man sleeping over at another womans sounds weird tbh... Or is this my bpd as well lol.. 

Btw, Couple years ago I went on a date with a dude who told me at the very first date that he does not like possessive and jealous girls and would hang out with girls regardless. This made me feel uncomfy and thrown off... I thought ‚Äúisn‚Äôt your bf suppose to be considering about your feelings?‚Äù. Because of this I wasn‚Äôt able to talk openly about it and kept it to myself until I broke down and cut him off right there and then.  And now I got a bf who‚Äôs willing to listen and change things. Yours might as well, so please try to talk to him. I bet you guys will figure it out."

Maybe even write? Write peoples name down who made an impact on you in a positive way. 
You want to be a winner? Do something different rn in this situation to break the cicle."
BorderlinePDisorder,f77qx5c,t3_dt2p49,1573471720.0,"!personally! I would not be okay with this. I don‚Äôt want reminders or leftovers of an ex in our new relationship. And it is in my right to feel that way. I would have told my bf this and watch his response. If you are important to him and it‚Äôs nothing more than just a ‚Äúnice painting‚Äù it shouldn‚Äôt be a problem to get rid of it. I think most people confuse 2 cases; 1) being controlling/abusive about things he/she likes which has nothing to do with an ex and everything to do with himself and telling them to get rid of it. 2) stuff being kept of an ex or even still having contact with an ex. With #2 you have all the right not to want this in your present relationship. #1 might be your BPD and/or irrational thoughts. #2 is okay if that‚Äôs something you can get over and know for sure or trust your partner. 
The thing is, if you guys want a functional relationship you change stuff around for each other (not the toxic version of this). For example you go to therapy and he gets rid of the painting that bothers you so much even when you tried not to. It should not be a problem to get rid of a painting nor to keep it. It really depends on you, your partner and what you guys want. 
To me, if it comes to an ex, there should be no problem getting rid of every single thing of it. 

I hope I don‚Äôt get misunderstood. English is my third language. + I might be all over the place since I got adhd combined typ besides BPD lol."
BorderlinePDisorder,f77pwre,t3_dtszww,1573470159.0,"He‚Äôs toxic and it‚Äôs time to let him go! He is not sorry for hurting you or making you uncomfy. He‚Äôs not the one. You have all the right to feel this way and it already has taken its tol on you... Please leave him. Get with somebody who makes you feel secure instead of gaslighting you the whole time. There is so much wrong with this relationship... He lied to you, he does not respect you. And this won‚Äôt help you feeling respected or any kind of positive thing...

BPD,eykllw3,t1_eyjknfs,1567158347.0,"If he knows about your condition than he‚Äôs being toxic. He atleast needs to sit down with you and talk about this. If my bf were to do this; hell would break loose. 
And for you, find things to do when he‚Äôs not around. Game, write, paint, sing, dance, watch movies/series etc. You need to keep yourself busy. It‚Äôs common with BPD to depend on someone and or have them as your fave person. 
And if this keeps on continuing, talk to him. Make him understand what‚Äôs going on and how that makes you feel like. And honestly some people won‚Äôt get it. 

Take me as an example, my bf understands my condition and feels for me that I don‚Äôt really have ‚Äúgood‚Äù friends. We even start crying together because he knows it sucks so bad to have no friends. (Eventho he now has a looooot of friends). Empathy is really important in a relastionship. And from what I read it seems like he a) don‚Äôt have it or b) he doesn‚Äôt understand why you act the way you act. 

Now I don‚Äôt know all of the background story about you two, so keep that in mind as well. 

Good luck! I wish you the best! And don‚Äôt forget your FEELINGS are important enough to be heard without any judgement! Don‚Äôt get gaslighted. You are worthy :)!"
