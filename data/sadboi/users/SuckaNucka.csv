ptsd,fgvjdey,t1_fgvcbjx,1581149613.0,I was just saying this to a friend. Obviously comparing trauma is really gross and dumb. But I see a lot of people throw the word around for any difficult situation and it's frusterating.
raisedbyborderlines,f9oxj4v,t3_e5kn9z,1575516084.0,I have a BPD dad too! He is comorbid with bipolar 1. You are not alone! Thank you for sharing this article. <3
ptsd,f9m7kl6,t1_f9lqo57,1575444891.0,Same thing happened to me. Except my breakdown was Feb 2018. I am in the same place as you. Hang in there
ptsd,f43qdvu,t3_dj9sq9,1571344124.0,"Hi friend. I have been taking prazosin for over a year now. I used to have nightmares andnnitht terrors every single night. I would constantly wake up the house screaming or soaked in sweat. It has been immensely helpful. I noticed a difference within a few days. After a month or two it started to help a lot! I still get the odd nightmare every once in a while but its manageable. Just a tip, make sure you do everything you need to before you take it. If I get up to go get a snack or water, I nearly pass out or almost throw up due to how low it makes my already low blood pressure. It's a small price to pay however, its saved my life. and it helps lower my night time anxiety as well. Good luck! I hope it helps, if it doesnt work for you dont get discouraged. Keep trying things"

raisedbyborderlines,etwahe4,t3_cdrp6x,1563260593.0,"NC is liberating, but also it can have moments of isolation, sadness, and grief. Hold space for those feelings. They are as important as the feelings of liberation and relief. This is a big complicated and layered feeling. But you're doing great by acknowledging it. It is okay and even healthy to feel sad about this. It means you have a big heart."
raisedbyborderlines,etqc3i3,t3_ccvseh,1563079300.0,"I have an uBPD dad too and this same. Exact. Thing. Would always happen. I once tried to go to him about some relationship advice as a teen. I liked this guy a lot but I wasnt sure if I should date him because he used drugs. Dad lost his fucking shit. It suddenly became an attack on HIM and HIS behavior. He's never even touched drugs, idk why he lost his shit. I spent the night locked in the bathroom while he raged. You're not going crazy OP. I believe you."
raisedbyborderlines,etkq6xe,t3_cby6m9,1562905050.0,"""I'll give you something to cry about."" Oh fuck. My uBPD dad said this in both funny comtexts and scary contexts and. You never knew what you were gonna get. A fun day shopping or a road rage incident. Usually both in the same day/hour."
raisedbyborderlines,etehg6n,t3_cb7cqb,1562732915.0,"I am in the same boat, friend. In high school is when I got really bad. I thought if I was constantly pleasant and constantly well behaved I would be able to control my uBPD dad's mood swings. When this eventually failed, I spent a lot of the next 2 years of college acting out and doing a lot of unnecessary risk taking and self destructive behavior as way to punish myself, but also to take back control. Somewhere along the line this morphed and evolved into semi agoraphobia which evolved again into the paralyzing perfectionism you just described. It's a really tricky thing. I'm 4 years in therapy this August and still trying to unravel this yarn ball. I am rooting for you!"
raisedbyborderlines,etegz1w,t3_ca29vk,1562732501.0,"Welcome to the team!! You're getting involved in something really special and important. Also just a shout out to all the mods, every time I come on here, even just to lurk, I am so proud of how hard you work to make this a safe place. Your dedication does not go unoticed ❤"
raisedbyborderlines,esnj4ak,t1_esk1rs3,1562134452.0,"I've gone on the same exact emotional journey you just described with my UBPD dad. My eMom also conveniently wipes her memory of his behavior. EMom is very much an ostrich and it makes me sad. I really like what you said at the end about being accountable for her abuse, that is something that's taken me many years of therapy to learn, believe, and accept."
raisedbyborderlines,esnihsb,t3_c8gu5q,1562133745.0,What a good reminder! I am glad you shared this
raisedbyborderlines,es2gv7z,t3_c5fjj1,1561523955.0,"I feel this SO MUCH. I remember distinctly being in high school and flippantly saying I don't get angry, that the emotion made me uncomfortable and I didn't know how to handle it so I just decided didn't have it. I wish I knew then what I know now, but I think my mind was still protecting me."
ptsd,eqplbis,t3_bz1j8j,1560201085.0,"I had daily nightmares. I have found prazosin to be extremely helpful. It took a couple months of adjusting to the dizziness but it went away and it has been so worth it. It has made a world of a difference for me and I encourage you to see if it will work for you. I should also note, sometimes it completely takes all nightmares away, other times I still have nightmares but I dont react emotionally to them and I dont feel as distressed when I wake up. Its not a perfect cure and I still have bad days, but, in hand with therapy and self care, it does a great job. Its sure better than the constant nightmares that caused me to dip a toe in the psychosis pool."
raisedbyborderlines,epnxdwl,t1_epnx43w,1559334999.0,Ohh I understand! Yes I had the same exact feeling. It was triggering but in a way it made me feel less alone. I hope you have a good day
raisedbyborderlines,epnx0vi,t1_epnw50f,1559334822.0,I'm sorry! It was not my intention to trigger anyone.
raisedbyborderlines,epno9f0,t1_ep3b9uv,1559330587.0,Thank you 💞
raisedbyborderlines,epno800,t1_ep6leiu,1559330569.0,Holidays are always a rollercoaster. It's always a circus and the BPD is the ring master of the shit show.
raisedbyborderlines,epno4mz,t1_ep5e4ch,1559330527.0,"I will try to do that! And thanks, I am proud of myself."
raisedbyborderlines,epno35m,t1_ep5vxs9,1559330508.0,Thank you so much for the kind words. Its validating to hear this ❤
raisedbyborderlines,epccbxn,t3_buhmlm,1559152582.0,For me it has been helpful to pick a color and count or name all the objects of that color where I am. If nothing else it is distracting. DP/DR is not fun at all. I wish I had more to help but I'm in the same boat.
