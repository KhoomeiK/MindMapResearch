capricorns,fqx3qdj,t1_fqvu6hi,1589725105.0,"I appreciate your words and concern. And I agree with what you said.
 Well, I'll be okay once I get out of this place. I dislike getting angry a lot. And sometimes emotions are just messy and get in the way. I may have hurt a bit my Cap today but that's mostly because of subtle annoyance which led me to displace it on him, but we talked it out so, it's good. (I'm a Libra though)"
capricorns,fqx35lw,t1_fqw1qb8,1589724715.0,"Agreed, but I really hope he tries to understand what you're actually trying to imply. It surely gets frustrating when they take your words in a negative connotation. I believe you guys need to sort this out, make your partner clear that you care about him and all, but there'll be times when some stuffs would need to be addressed. You got this.üíõ"
capricorns,fqvqbv7,t1_fqvog6p,1589682800.0,"Same. I try to evaluate the situation, but yeah, as you said, it hurts sometimes and you can't help but end up confronting. I try to be gentle as possible when I'm clarifying the situation but there are times I get upset as in sad too. So I try to confront that to him later, as to avoid miscommunication."
capricorns,fqvl8h6,t1_fqvj3xw,1589679655.0,"I agree wholeheartedly. It just pisses me off when my parents lash out at me or give silent treatment, instead of pointing out what I did. I can sort of relate to your situation though. Hope you're doing okay as of now."
capricorns,fqvkprn,t3_gl2lvk,1589679353.0,"Pretty much same with my Cap as well, but I(Libra, F), try my best to confront about it and resolve things down. Sometimes I overanalyse stuffs and say it on his face, which undoubtedly has, hurt him. Later we resolved it down. :)
But I would say, clear communication is the shit."
