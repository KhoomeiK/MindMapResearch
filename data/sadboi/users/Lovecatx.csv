EUGENIACOONEY,fqx10v1,t1_fqryrdg,1589723184.0,"I wish I had doctors and people not bring up and complain at me about my being underweight, that sounds wonderful. I get issues about it constantly from doctors and people do cite it as emblematic of my apparent general incompetence in life and perpetually use it as evidence that I'm in a terrible state even if I'm doing well. I am not diagnosed with an eating disorder or anything and maybe that's why medical professionals and family think they can just be critical of it willy nilly but it causes me a lot of issues with my self image. I can be going to the doctor for unrelated things and I'll still get a guilt-trippy talking to and certain treatment denied. I have spent my entire life getting my eating habits policed and constantly critisised and made a huge deal out of by my family, to the extent that I have a good deal of childhood trauma around it. This is still nothing compared to the frequency and omnipresence of fat people's poor treatment in health and social settings as a group but it still takes a really, really hard toll and I know I am not alone in this ass I know people with very similar issues to me who are in similar boats.

 I understand that in the grand scheme of things 'thin' is the ideal and such body types are put on a pedestal but just because you have had minimal social concern put upon you as a result of your health issues doesn't mean that is universal, just as my poor treatment is also not universal. There obviously are things that need to be considered as you are suffering and that isn't a pleasant thing to experience. Yes, 'thin privilege' is undoubtedly a thing, but it doesn't negate the fact that people are still treated poorly based on their appearence, arbitralily, in various settings."

13ReasonsWhy,fcz6qm9,t3_ejmpsn,1578094794.0,"Yes, Skye has a lot of problematic behaviours. But, having been a self-infuring teen with (for me back then) untreated Bipolar Disorder, I know that that is very difficult and can lead to (but in no way excuse) certain inappropriate behaviour. I behaved all kinds of Wrong and Wild back then, and since I was young at the time, I thought a whole bunch of insensitive and horrible things that I grew out of. I can see a lot of that in Skye's character. And I like her character. 

I wouldn't label her as ""emo"" in such a dismissive way. She is legitimately mentally ill. And she is portrayed as such, moreso than I feel Hannah was. It's obviously not perfect, but I think they did okay with it.

Also, yes, self injury is a problem and is wrong. And her saying that IS insensitive. BUT self injury is often misconstrued by other people to be inherently a suicidal gesture. But it isn't. And I feel that was her gist, and it's understandable to be angry about a common misconception like that. I mean, I have permission to do it in bad times from my Psychologist who I've been seeing for years. And he has helped me reduce it LOADS. But there are issues that are (for many people) more concerning than cutting, and it is those things (like poisoning for example) that we are working to prevent. Obviously, avoiding cutting completely is the aim and for some people it reaches extremely dangerous levels but it isn't as simple as it just being another Bad Thing akin to suicide. And it's important to not feel like a failure if you have a relapse after a long clean spell. Emotions are hard.

I've been out of my teens for nearly a decade, but I can remember a lot of how I was back then and into my early 20s. It was quite refreshing, to me, to see a character like Skye - warts and all.

And then due to lack of tolerance, they die.

Also, I'm new to the sub, so, hello all!"
TheStaircase,fatkth3,t1_f9vddng,1576339198.0,"Fuck sake. I'm bisexual and have been with my partner for 14 years and have never cheated or been in any way promiscuous. The ""promiscuity"" argument is bigotted rubbish that people continue to buy into for some bizarre reason."

GreenAndPleasant,fam7v01,t1_falyjpp,1576197678.0,"Fucking hell. I traveled three hours from Dundee, where I am for Uni, to my town of origin today to vote on the opposite side of the country. And I do that every time, for every election - general, local, EU. I cannot be doing with that kind of shite reasoning. 

My partner does postal votes for our town of origin and that works fine for him in Dundee. I just prefer to go in person.

I do agree with the idea that the tories were fucking over the youth by putting the election right around exam time, and I find that to be a super slimy move."

EUGENIACOONEY,fahoqrw,t3_e99h5q,1576090289.0,"Eating disorders are quite common with Autistic people - particularly anorexia and particularly in Autistic women and girls, as far as I know. You also get a lot of just general food issues because of the sensory problems. Sometimes it's ARFID. I'm an Aspie myself and I would say there are quite a few things about Eugenia which come across as spectrumy, but that could be due to a bunch of other things just making it look like she's on the spectrum. Like her eating disorder coupled with her strange-seeming home life. I can see that looking like Aspergers. So I'm open to either notion."
bipolar2,f9nw8iw,t3_e61z99,1575491701.0,"There can be all kinds of reasons for not having mentioned the symptoms in appointments, don't worry. For me, I didn't really bring them up with my psychologist because I had been repeatedly sent to psychiatry by my GP about my symptoms and they were consistently dismissive. Like they thought I was being a silly wee girl. This upset me so much that eventually I just stopped mentioning the ""up"" side of things to doctors because they kept dismissing it.

So, I bounced back and forth for ages, then was referred to psychology and THEN after a particularly intense mixed episode, my psychologist referred me to the psychiatrist. Who then took my symptoms seriously. And that took from the age of 19 to my now age of 27."

Youniqueamua,f946v8x,t1_f93rsxt,1575079113.0,"My Granny has her eyebrows tattooed and she's 76! Although she only got hers done a couple of years back and they are as natural looking as possible, so they aren't anything like the sort of caterpillars I see younger people currently getting permanently drawn on their faces.

 So, while my Gran had hers done in old age because they became whispy and faint with time - and so they look in balance with her general look - I imagine once the folk on the younger side reach pensioner-status, those brows will look very much UNbalanced and ridiculous, unless they cultivate a really harsh style into their later years."

blunderyears,f1vv2hs,t3_dau64v,1569776309.0,"My mid-2000s self would have thought you were the coolest thing ever. '05-'07 me (age 13-15) was aaaaall about surfing those Bebo groups, y'know, the ones with names along the lines of ""Best Scene Queens of Bebo"" and there would just be loads of folders of photos from the Famous Names of Bebo. I miss all that, hah."
antiMLM,f1ncnm9,t1_f1mwfi3,1569614163.0,"Those parents make me so angry. Imagine hating your child for who they are so fucking much that you make them injest bleach. You cannot separate Autism from your child, it's not some kind of malicious disease. Autism is not the end of the world but they say these people talk about it it's as if it's a bloody death sentence! Yeah, it makes life in an NT world extremely difficult For Us, the Autistic folk themselves, but that is not an excuse for you to talk about wanting to kill your child when they are in the damn room as if it is worse for you! They seem to take it personally that their child is on the spectrum. It upsets me. We are not defective, we just experience the world in a different way. 

Apologies. Most parents of people on the spectrum aren't like this, obviously. But the ones that do are so vocal about it and it makes me cry."
selfharm,f1ip6qy,t3_d9fbla,1569513275.0,"I like when I see that. I do it myself when I'm hot so seeing a fellow sufferer also not hiding it makes me feel better about it. When I was younger it was long sleeves year-round, but when I hit about 20/21 I said 'fuck it' and switched to being physically comfortable regardless of temperature."
BipolarReddit,f0y62on,t3_d6x3lb,1569061746.0,"I'm like that but round the other way, mostly. If I'm up I'm more likely to separate my feelings from others and it goes the other way when I'm down, though that isn't a rule - it's just the usual way it goes for me. I'm on quetiapine, so I can't speak for if it's a meds thing. I've always been like this. I am Autistic though, and my wild empathy swings definitely are because of that, for me. I am either a total emotional sponge or indifferent to feelings. Keep in mind I never have ""understanding"" (?) type empathy, I have extreme sharing-feelings empathy. Sorry, that sounds a bit weird, it's difficult to express succinctly. I'm not suggesting you are definitely on the spectrum or anything, it just could be something to look into. I have a lot of Autistic pals and family members and they have similar empathy issues, just not as changeable or ramped up because they aren't Bipolar as well."
HIMYM,f0ss5fi,t3_d6egrc,1568909756.0,"Huh, that makes it only slightly younger than my partner and I's relationship! We hit 14 years together on the 8th*. HIMYM is something we both adore and have watched to death together too. :) It is still quoted constantly.

*Incidently, we have now been together for more of our lives than we've been apart. Not relevant, I just like that fact. (We were 13 in '05, y'see.)"
BadMUAs,f0p6bd0,t1_f0oqm9t,1568828121.0,"Yeah, I'm extremely pale (to the extent that I have never met anyone paler) and very much cool toned and it's nigh on impossible to find foundation that doesn't turn me yellow. Thankfully, I have good skin so I just wear very light products, but if I am in need of concealer it immediately causes problems. Yellow spots all over the place, not a good look."
bipolar2,f0m4lhf,t3_d5iuw4,1568736648.0,"I create much more when manic, and I think I create the most when mixed. Mixed episodes are the absoute worst and most dangerous thing for me though, so it doesn't even count as a plus point. When I'm depressed I'm too apathetic to do anything, really. This causes problems when you are at art school..."
