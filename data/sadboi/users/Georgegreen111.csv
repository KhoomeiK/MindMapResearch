nutmeg,fqr8pni,t3_gjzv8m,1589579684.0,Think nutmeg is bad? Try kava root. Tastes like shit. So nasty. Nutmeg tastes like candy in comparison
depression,fper9hc,t3_g9ndgw,1588553247.0,"Same here. I had some interesting experiences when I was 15 that I haven’t fully bounced back from but at the same time I feel like it made me into a better person in some ways. 

I feel like I’ve been dying slowly for the last couple of years. Both inside and out. Life keeps giving me ‘gifts’ then taking them from me and kicking me in the balls. Things have proceeded to get worse, one phase of my life out ghettos the next and so on. 

I’m really sorry to hear you feel like that. I wish you well, as feeling like that is no way to live at all. Good luck"

relationship_advice,foc7rx9,t3_g6s9n5,1587668106.0,I am really frustrated I’ve given him so much benefit of the doubt. He’s just been unnecessarily rude. I’ve asked if there’s something he wanted to talk about I’ve told him to be upfront and honest. Frankly I can’t tolerate the energy he’s putting out. I guess this is how he’s going to be...

nutmeg,fliwfdw,t3_fovvhk,1585192395.0,I haven’t taken nutmeg in years but I’ve been thinking about it. Maybe tomorrow I’ll take a tablespoon.
nutmeg,fkvqmzx,t3_fkwnyi,1584574688.0,My brother dosed around 50-54g once years ago and said it felt like a really strong all day edible trip but that he had a side ache the next day
nutmeg,fkvqbpq,t3_fkwnyi,1584574504.0,"I felt a lot of euphoria but a little anxiety in the come up. It felt just like a full scale weed high. I have a low ish tolerance to weed so when I smoke 3-4 hits I’m good for a few hours. This was like I’d taken 10 good hits and maybe popped 4 Benadryl.

I’ve smoked a lot of weed and drank my fair share. Not much experience outside weed and booze. My friends do a lot of shrooms though. I’m wanting them to try this and tell me how it compares to weed or maybe even things they’ve done."
trippy,fki7bxi,t3_fi5x03,1584213357.0,"The major problem is his tolerance is through the roof. He has to take more and more and once he puked up blood and fainted. He ate a really strong weed edible which he said was ‘the highest he’s ever been,’ and nutmeg simply hasn’t been the same since."
kratom,fkg3la5,t3_fi7c8v,1584149103.0,Oh yes. I did that at work years ago and had a gut ache of the ages.
trippy,fkfmncx,t3_fi5x03,1584137806.0,"It’s like tripping on Benadryl and weed but with a nauseating flu symptoms, 2 day hangover and headache. And the nutmeg breath that lasts for hours, don’t forget the horrible nutmeg breath."
trippy,fkfm3o4,t3_fi5x03,1584137451.0,"He says it feels like a cross between a trip and being stoned. 4-6 tablespoons gets him high and more then that he gets a tripish type of high. 

He’s done acid twice, first 100ug and the second time was much more significant with a 200ug. He’s done shrooms probably 50 times, and he’s done dangerous amounts of robitussin and NyQuil. 

I don’t understand. Nutmeg is the worst high on earth. The come up you feel like crap. You’re tired for days after especially taking that damn much. He’s grown a tolerance to it though due to crossing over to cannabis and shrooms."
kratom,fk992rx,t3_fgqj30,1583971234.0,"I take 1-1.5 teaspoon in the morning with green tea, coffee or a monster hydro energy drink. 

One t-spoon in the afternoon after lunch, before going to gym, 

One teaspoon between dinner and bedtime. And...

2-3 tspoon half an hr before bed. 

Yes it’s a lot but I have an extremely high tolerance."
kratom,fk98djc,t3_fh34ih,1583970822.0,Not as much anymore. I find mixing kratom with caffeine can make me very irritable.
findapath,fjyb3g5,t3_ff33so,1583693257.0,"I’ve had lots of horrible jobs until I finally landed the work current from home position. 

McDonald’s. This job sucked. Plain and simple. Manager was a psychopath and all the other supervisors were psycho. Yelling at everybody all the time. Literally yelling. Then they’d talk crap about you in Spanish. Everything about this job was bad. Cooking, cleaning, draining the grease traps, dishes, and working 40-55 hrs a week. 

Believe it or not McDonald’s was a piece of cake compared to one of my many custodial jobs. I worked at this large high school dumping garbage, vacuuming, the usual. The work was a lot because we were understaffed. The staff were horrible ppl. They were seriously horrible ppl to be around. They made fun of me and would make fun of another employee. They’d trick him and make him go in on holidays, and they’d lock him outside. I only worked here a month and a half it was so bad. 

Now the worst. Working at a car wash. This was horrible x5. worked lots of shitty jobs and this was the worst. The staff bullied and screamed at their workers all day. You were not allowed to take breaks. It was slavery. And they’d keep you over time and wouldn’t pay you. Dishonest, shady and disgusting. I worked there 3 weeks and quit. I literally could not do it. 

Now I work from home and I’m grateful I do. The only chill job I had was my last custodial job, I had five of those total. They’d cater food every day for all staff. Work was easy, better pay, better staff etc."

trees,fir7g0p,t3_eh80wq,1582658873.0,"I had a few first times. Once when I was 13 and again when I was 21. 

First time as a kid, my brother, his friend and I decided to have a sleepover. This was in 2006-7. We each told our parents we were going to the other house but we had going to an unfinished house in mind. We get there at 10:00 on a Friday and set up our sleeping bags and a portable tv. I had smoked pot ten times by this point but never for high. They were going to keep smoking me up till I was high. They were both 17 and I was 13. We smoked some dank chronic. I got between 10-12 hits before I began to feel a rush and euphoria. I thought this was the high, then it began to really hit. I began to space out and lose control of my ego. I freaked out. I actually had a panic attack. My brothers friend is laughing his head off while my brothers trying to tell me it’s going to be ok. I had no idea what was actually happening. I thought I was dying. After 5 minutes of terror the high significantly decreases. I just feel a floating trippy euphoria after for the rest of the night. Me freaking out ultimately made us change our plans and go sleep in the deck at my parents house. We just sat there and smoked cigarettes and weed. I only smoked cigs because I didn’t want to get high again after that. I smoked 3-5 times a week for a year after that and then quit. 


SECOND first time as an adult. Thumb will be worth the read trust me. Seven years later I was going through some shit. Been completely sober since age fourteen. Job sucked, boss was a dick, couldn’t move out of my parents etc, now this was in october 2014. This had a significant impact on my life. This is a long one.

I hit up some buddies who lived a county away. I’d been thinking of trying things again for a few months prior to this and finally did. As soon as I get there my friends are shocked because I was always the sober ‘clean edge’ guy in the group. The three of us were going to clean his house after we smoked. They let me take three hits and that’s it. I kind of gave them crap and told them I could handle it jokingly. 

10 minutes in I’m high. I’m laughing and kind of shocked because it’s my first time in many years. As time passes I keep gradually getting higher. After 35-40 minutes it really kicks in. I’m much more stoned then I could handle. I was hyper and beginning to regret my decision to ‘relapse’. I’m trying to hold my shit together so I don’t embarrass myself but I’m in the brink of ego death. I’m not kidding when I say I was tripping. It felt like I went to a strange unforgivable alien world in which I had little to no control. Everything was lagging significantly. My stomach was in knots. I couldn’t escape this high not even for a second. Every thought and feeling I had was overwhelmed by this high. I wanted it to end and even started saying that I’m not feeling good. I even asked if there was a way I could kill this high. I also asked if there was lsd tainted in the bowl to which they laughed and assured I had an exceptional low tolerance and it had been way too long. I now realize you can’t smoke lsd. I was dumber back then lol. 

Some time into the high a song came on and I’d heard this so many times but for the first few seconds the song was completely unrecognizable. It was like I’d died and was hearing the song for the first time. A song that was four minutes literally felt like 4 HOURS. I’d disappear into my own head to return like waking back up and would hear the same song playing. I thought it was playing over and over but they told me it was only the first time!! 

I was seeing the world through the youngest pair of eyes I could remember. I felt like I was very young again and seeing the world through reinvented eyes. I was anxious about driving home and seeing my parents. At one point I thought I’d be stuck like that forever. My sober life felt so far away. 

This experience changed my life forever."
