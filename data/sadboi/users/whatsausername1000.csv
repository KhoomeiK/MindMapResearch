We live in the USA but are from a European background and whenever Italy had that whole thing about banning veganism for children and jailing their parents she was so for it... I’m definitely going to try to make some vegan meals for her soon! She thinks it’s a lot more expensive but.. we already eat vegetables! + an animal’s life is a lot more expensive than any form of vegan food.

I come from a family/culture where meat is prevalent in most foods. I’ve never asked my mom to go vegan just to make the house more vegan-friendly. As a parent, what do you think I should try and ask/tell her in order to convince her to make the house more vegan friendly?"
Depop,fot076h,t1_fosvjp3,1588041757.0,omg thats what i meant! sorry i didnt know how to word it properly!! i saw a post where it was a hollister top that looked like the gina top and it stated it in the caption but the brand was tagged brandy and i commented just tag it “hollister and use brandy in the tags?? its so annoying when you search brandy and its only this stuff” and they attacked me that “its CLEARLY stated in the caption”

Up until now it hasn’t really been a problem due to the fact that I can go a lot of places with it. I’m graduating in 2022 so good to know! I’ll get a Romanian passport next summer and be sure to contact the universities I’m considering. Thank you for the reply! A lot more help than my guidance counsellor aha.

Depop,fl7m4mk,t3_fn51ov,1584904594.0,i went to her account and she had that brandy top that people threatened that 1 girl over and it was priced at $15 and an iso but she mentions its an iso later on in her caption... it also had 2 pics. if someone doesnt read the caption and only looks at the price it looks like shes selling it which is uhh...

I don’t know about all that he was about to get refunded but his “tour” which included a nationwide tour with Jerusalem and Tel-Aviv included wasn’t refunded. It was super expensive and the best he could get was that if he goes back to Israel he can get the tour then at no additional cost... because we all just go fly across the ocean and the continent of Africa wheely-neely..

They think that’s how you become a drug addict & therapy is for “people who have real problems.” So, I really can’t get professional help until I’m 18, and I think he kind of had it for me because of it.

He wasn’t always the villain, and I wasn’t either. I knew how to take responsibility for my actions but usually when I would apologize he’d continue screaming at me and telling me he doesn’t believe me. I would walk on eggshells around him even when I didn’t need to, but something that happened a year ago almost to the day that he did traumatized me and I think that me walking on eggshells makes him think I’m distancing myself. Neither of us knew how to be there for the other, I’d usually end up being told to kill myself by the end of the night whenever I’d ask for help... I would try and make him feel better the way I would want someone to make me feel better, and when he’d ask for help & I would do that, I’d get yelled at for not helping. I hope one day him and I will get back together and end up like the two of you. You guys sound really strong, I’m happy for you"
