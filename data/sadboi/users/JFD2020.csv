You both lack experience when it comes to dealing with a relationship, yeah yeah you might have life experience because you have been living for 30 years, but when it comes to a solid LOVE relationship you need the experience or might just be one of those lucky couples that does make it happen..."

weed,evls25j,t1_evkszdc,1564598482.0,Yeah documentaries are alright but when you are baked you want something like the big shot. Something that is very informative and intense as well... It also has a great set of actors that make an incredible cast.

weed,evjvgok,t1_evjlw5y,1564570607.0,Other recommendations of movies I want to get warped into? For example project almanac or the big shot are great fucking movies to watch and be mind blown. Like the big shot is full of geniuses and people who literally can afford most of the things on the face of the earth... Doesn't that fucking twist your mind towards money?
