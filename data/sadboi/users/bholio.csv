BPD,fqlnrun,t3_gj1nob,1589462509.0,"I was just thinking about this asnim in that kind of mood. I'm in my ""home"" living with my parents in the house I grew up in and still I feel like I want to go home to some where that is not here. I think I associate that feeling with wanting to be somewhere where I feel comfortable and happy which are not words I'd describe how I feel when in around my parents."
BodyDysmorphia,fqhga9o,t3_gitcxd,1589376371.0,I definitely find it easier to accept a negative than I do a compliment. Compliments make me feel like I'm being mocked where if someone says something less nice then at least I feel like they're being truthful.  Everything you wrote rings true for me.
BPD,fpdin06,t3_gcu7xm,1588527727.0,Absolutely. I feel like a blank person. What am I supposed to say to people if I'm completely empty? And the problem with asking people questions about themselves is they tend to ask you back. I dont have anything to say. And yet I'm desperate for connection.
BPD,fpcjd25,t3_gchf99,1588502720.0,"Yes. A lot. I can be hanging out with friends and having a good time and I will get images appear in my head of various forms of self harm, some that are things I would/could do and others really grotesque mutilating stuff that I doubt I'd ever do. Plus the casual voice that pops up and sweetly suggests that I could/should/might as well kill myself. I've had various forms of these thoughts for so long (mostly when I actually do feel shit) that I think it's really the only thing my brain knows what to do with itself."
BPDmemes,fp5bope,t1_fp1umn7,1588323358.0,I feel so embarrassed that I answer every question with 'I dont know'. My therapist reassures me that it's ok to not know and then will give me options of what we could talk about and I still answer 'I dont know' (mostly because I've forgotten the list of things they said before they even finished).
yarntrolls,fnt3tmk,t1_fnt2wld,1587234082.0,When I was ready to give up trying to knit I saw something about continental knitting and gave it a try instead of the English style knitting I'd started to learn with. It means I'm holding the working yarn in my left hand instead of the right and after a little practice and research on YouTube it was so much easier for me. Maybe you could have a look at alternative ways to hold your yarn/work your stitches. (I was knitting too tight but a different technique helped in changing my tension so could work the other way?)
Psychonaut,fn4q8a1,t3_fyydww,1586646629.0,"Yep. They dont fix things but definitely help me to change how I think and feel for a little while. Plus I get half a day of being giggly that feels so right but I find it hard to laugh like that when sober anymore.  
Not recommended, but I've taken shrooms while I've been suicidal and planning how I could kill myself in that moment and ended up having one of the most enjoyable days.   
I think they have helped me so much more than anything else when it comes to my mental health and my sense of self."
BPD,flo84l5,t3_fpyoto,1585333357.0,"Absolutely. I've had friends tell me their first impression of me was that I'm a bitch. I've also been told that im unreadable and unapproachable â˜¹ it's down to me being so worried about how I come across to others that I don't want to engage in too much conversation, feeling like shit so much that I feel I only have negativity to add and not wanting people to waste their time on me. It can take me months to warm up to people and feel more comfortable around them."
knitting,fln1yqs,t3_fpjloy,1585306114.0,"So cool! I'm making a similarly sized scrap blanket with any scraps 6"" or longer and held together with cream (not scrap) yarn and it's taken me forever to get to something half this size so I am incredibly impressed. I'm now at a point where I'm out of scraps and collecting them as I make other projects so I'm expecting it to take several more years for me to complete it ðŸ˜©"
BPD,fln1j0i,t3_fpp7g6,1585305609.0,"I feel like my every day high anxiety is being masked because everyone is now high anxiety. It's making me feel almost normal (but pretty guilty for not being more anxipus). Plus, I'm very suited to a slow lifestyle and most of my hobbies are things I can do at home. So for the time being, while no one I know is ill due to covid 19, I feel kind of good."
BPD,flcslh3,t1_flcqmzd,1585044757.0,"Yep, it can make me feel so unhappy, embarrassed and ashamed. Hoping for the best for you and that you find a way to manage with these thoughts and feelings x"
BPD,flcpih0,t1_flcorix,1585040797.0,Ah thank you. I do feel that way about every other person but it's hard to see for myself. It's something I am working on but I don't know how I'm going to start believing anything good about myself. Romantic relationships are definitely the hardest thing for me as the instant I like someone I feel all the bad about me is under a spotlight and then I don't want to even be seen by others.
BPD,flcopod,t3_fnk1kh,1585039771.0,"I don't do dating at all. I don't have anything to offer when it comes to looks, intelligence or personality so why would I waste someone's time?"
BPD,fl6azpf,t3_fmnzq7,1584860912.0,"Oh absolutely, I work in a primary school so it's something that I encounter quite often. It makes me feel like one of the kids rather than the staff ðŸ™ˆ Although I do think that this level of exposure has helped me to deal with it better and now sometimes it affects me less than it used."
BPD,fky8sn2,t3_fl64ri,1584643903.0,"I used to have really vivid dreams that could span years and they felt so real. Once I dreamt that I fell in love with a man and we spent years together happily, had children and lived a beautiful life which came crashing down around us when some kind of political overhaul happened and armed soldiers flood our apartment complex and killed both my children. Woke up completely emotionally exhausted and it took days for me to get over it.   
I've also had countless dreams where I've had encounters with an unkown person and had intense feelings for them.   
It's such a bizarre experience and I understand just how horrible it can be when you experience these kinds of relationships in a dream but not in waking life."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fkte7kr,t3_fkete5,1584515910.0,"I haven't been clothes shopping for years, I've only stepped into a changing room once in at least 5 years. I rarely even order clothes online anymore. Whenever I bring up issues about my body/clothes/food I am completely dismissed as if I can't hate my body because I'm 'small' and 'thin'."
BPD,fk4ns7d,t3_fgcrhs,1583864087.0,This is so relatable. I have no idea how I could ever get even a fraction of this as I'm drowning at work and not even earning enough to rent the shittiest flats around here and I have no energy from work to spend much time on hobbies. I don't want much more than to live contentedly in my own space but it's so unrealistic it's laughable.

BPD,fjrezyi,t3_fembxf,1583584751.0,"28 and never had a proper relationship. It's been 8 years since I even had any kind of romantic thing. I have so many thoughts about not being good enough and not wanting to make someone's life worse for being in it and I just can't believe that people like me, at least not for more than  a few hours at a time. I want so badly to be able to have a good, healthy relationship but it doesn't seem very likely. My symptoms get worse when I have attention , romantic attention in particular â˜¹"
BPD,fjjfm26,t3_fdqkai,1583393886.0,"I have this problem too. If I'm just sitting and talking about my problems they feel so distant that I can't really relate to them so I don't bring them up because it makes me feel like I'm making it up even though I know that I did feel that way last week/yesterday/ an hour ago. I'm so used to squashing down every emotion for fear of getting carried away by them that my understanding of them is very poor. My current therapist said he often can't tell what's going on with me when we talk because I look like I'm incredibly upset but i can't actually express it in any way to him. It makes me feel like I'm failing at therapy and I can feel the number of sessions I have left quickly dwindling. I don't have anything to suggest, sorry."
BPD,fd93lvt,t3_ekb3hi,1578227858.0,"I've got it pretty bad atm. I don't really have any positive ways to cope, usually smoke until I fall asleep but I've got no weed so I've spent the last 24hrs in bed struggling with my thoughts bouncing from ""i want to kill myself"" to ""I'm going to change everything about myself and my life"" with not enough time between thoughts to actually do something"
BPD,fd91kje,t3_ek4ca5,1578226876.0,"I get this way too. It can take me ages to warm up to my friends and relax even though I've been friends with most of them for over ten years. I finally start feeling comfortable and then it's time to leave and I almost instantly fall into this empty feeling. I feel completely outside of everyone's lives, out of the whole world, like there is nothing I could do that would have any real consequence or affect anyone else. It makes me feel so lonely and unseen.  

My parents have always been pretty emotionally absent and I could never go to them if I was upset unless there was a good enough reason like having fallen over and needing cuts or grazes cleaning and that was only from my mum, I'd never seek any comfort from my dad. I feel like they not only didn't give me emotional support but they didn't take any interest me or want to spend time with me. I think this is a huge factor as to why I struggle to open up and be around people but also why I so desperately want some attention and affection. I don't have any skills to deal with my emotions or know how to approach people for support because I never have before and now at 28 it's proving very difficult to learn how."
DecidingToBeBetter,fbeh54o,t3_ecthzm,1576785578.0,"I'm happy for you! I know how daunting the dentist can be, I went this year for the first time in nearly a decade. I was too embarrassed and scared to go but couldn't put it off after my tooth broke. I got away with it lightly too and only needed a small amount of work but now I know that I can do it and I can go again, but I need to make sure I keep regular appointments and not let it slip again."
depression_memes,f3ygtly,t3_din5kp,1571253772.0,Haha everyday on the way in to work and then on the way home back to my parents house ðŸ™ƒ
nottingham,ev934wh,t3_cimygv,1564303523.0,Yes! I know there are some groups that meet regularly but they never seem to be on a day/time I can do.
knitting,et5xh0w,t3_ca2i7w,1562495377.0,I'd also like to know what you're using for the weight. Is every hexipuff weighted? This is a cool idea that I'd like to try but I've already got about 50 unweighted hexis
