advice that sounds cliche, but has helped me a bit , is a response to the commonly asked question 'what is the purpose of life, why shouldn't I die?' but the answer is 'Why die early?'

for many of us, we will experience somewhat suffering our whole lives. but with the proper care, treatment, support, and the bettering and evolution of ourselves, it does change a bit . we will all inevitably die. If you aren't religious, you probably believe we have nothing after death. So why rush it? We have the many years of eternal peace after we hopefully, die naturally. 

 life is what we make it. I'm not saying your problems are your fault. I doubt they are. but life can become we what deserve. You deserve the best. Go for that. find a therapist, a friend, medication, a partner... and if you're unable to get those things? it could even be a goddamn song, or a book!. Whatever makes you have a small bit of hope, I want you to pursue that like never before. If you just need this time to step back and reevaluate everything... do that. life will eventually end for all of us. but ultimately, we hold the say in how it will turn out . 

every bit of perseverance you have is necessary right now. I know you probably don't want to try. That you are tired and it hurts to move, it hurts to breathe, it hurts to exist. Maybe you feel absolutely nothing. life may seems pointless to you... but you get to make the point. Maybe at the end of your life you will not have everything you want. But maybe you will have one thing you do. 

feel free to pm me. if you need me to pm you first (I get that it's hard to reach out!) tell me... tell ne what you need. whether that be to rant, just talk, tell me how I can help you. because remember, people don't always know."

It's just everyone is so happy with their provincial lives , everyone is so okay with them selves, even the worst of people, and yet I,  a relatively good guy, has to deal with ongoing numbness and emptiness.

I'm not angry at them for being happy. I'm so happy *for* them. I'm just baffled at how they're able to go about their lives with a purpose. I hope I find that one day."
