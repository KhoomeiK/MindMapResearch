It’s like a person being upfront and saying they just want hookups and casual sex. Intentions are stated up front.

But in reality having Daddy issues is not really fun or cute. It can cause self esteem issues, relationship troubles and lead to addiction if not processed properly. 

I’ve heard men joke about girls with daddy issues. They have a reputation of being easy and fucked up. I’ve heard guys say “girls with daddy issues are fun to fuck but they aren’t gf or wife material because they are damaged goods”.

I have daddy issues and it was very painful. Took many years to work through in therapy. 

Defying the stereotype, I’m actually a “cougar” and prefer much younger men.
