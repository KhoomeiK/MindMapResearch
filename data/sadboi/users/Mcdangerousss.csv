unpopularopinion,fqyl6cl,t3_glnhrc,1589750381.0,"Yes. Nobody held a gun at your head and forced you to do it. You joined that gang by your own decisions. Using poverty as an excuse is just a way to avoid being held accountable for your actions. 

Our culture needs to shift away from where it’s currently at. I didn’t even grow up in a shitty neighborhood but it wasn’t as nice as the one beside me. Nicer then the one beside that one tho. And way too many people used the “we aren’t rich like them” excuse to break the law to make fast money. 

It doesn’t help that young girls think all that shits cool. It’s cool until half your friends have criminal records, nobody wants to hire them and they have ptsd from the shit they got into when they were only 16. 

Our culture is currently glorifying stuff that should not be glorified. Coincidently, all this gangsta shit became cool after deals were signed by record labels and the prison industry. Don’t believe me? Look it up. 

We are purposely misleading the youth to fund a for profit private prison system. 

Before you blame it on capitalism, perhaps blame it on the privatization of prisons. This isn’t fully relevant but certain services should be public and others should be private. Prisons should definitely be public, as the government wouldn’t have a need to fill them to make money while corporations would. That does not mean all businesses are bad, nor am I saying all other businesses are good. I just wanna put this out there because I don’t want communist smoothbrains thinking I agree with them.

Also family is a bit tougher. I have a friend who’s whole family was highly into organized crime and not only did they not enforce any rules or make him go to school, when he was a teenager his mom did coke with him. His parents just fully let him and even encouraged him to become a drug dealer. That’s not 100% an excuse but he would have had to go out of his way to not end up the way he did.

Edit: I used to be one of those thuggish youths. It stops being cool real fast after high school."

If you see a guy with one of those bags at a bar odds are it’s full drugs. The dude in the white also looked like he had Kappa track pants. Another drug dealer staple. If I see a dude wearing kappa pants and an over the shoulder bag idk what he looks like my first thought is drug dealer. Especially if the bags Gucci. He also had a gold chain on. 

The aggression about the 500$ also implies drug money cuz ya know drug dealers gotta be tough. 

There’s also the threats of stabbing and shooting they make throughout the video. Drug dealers tend to do that to each other. 

Edit: the pants don’t look like kappa but they’re in that same style with the design running down one side.

Edit 2: my guess is that white shirt Is a newer member in a “organized” crime syndicate. I use the word organized very loosely. He fronted black shirt a pound of weed and black shirt has to pay him. After failing to collect the money from black shirt the other members are getting violent with him because it’s the groups money on the line.
