I'm doing the bare minimum I need to do to survive and if some days I can't get out of bed then whatever I won't get out. I'm really lucky to have a good support group of friends but unfortunately I'm still waiting for therapy (hopefully gonna get it soon as I've been waiting almost a year now). When I feel sad I look at videos or pictures of dogs or cats or look at Charlie Macksey's work on Instagram. His stuff is very uplifting and wholesome.

mentalhealth,f6po3jh,t3_dsi0iu,1573060615.0,"Fuck man i felt like I was reading my own life story for a while there. 

I literally relate SOOOOOO much to everything you've been through. I found the love of my life too and constantly worry how I would survive without him. Everything you wrote was terrifyingly accurate to how I feel. I even got him to make an agreement he's not allowed to die before me lmao. 

I just try my hardest to feel grateful that I have him and his love. I met someone recently who is suffering with similar stuff to me and she literally can't talk to her boyfriend of 5 years about any of it! When she's upset she has told him to just stay out her way. When she told me this I literally went home and cuddle my boyfriend and just closed my eyes and felt so lucky that he literally is my rock. I try and live in the moment and not worry about losing him in the future. 

It's fucking hard man. Honestly, you're not crazy. Well maybe you are but DW I am too so we can just be crazy together. But also, this just shows how this is normal for the type of abuse we've been through if we both feel the same?? Are you going to therapy? Also there's a book which I haven't read (lol) but everyone tells me to read called ""Daughters of Narcissistic Mother's"". Apparently it's very good. 

I will end this in my fav Winnie the Pooh quote ""how lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard"" üíõüíõüíõ"
mentalhealth,f6pmo0n,t3_dsiaig,1573059713.0,"Hey I can completely relate. Some days are really hard. I feel angry and cheated, other days I get flashbacks and I feel like I'm back in that dark place and I'm terrified and upset. 

Having said that, I'm a big believer in everything that happens in your life makes you the person you are today. If I hadn't gone through all that shit, what kind of person would I be? 

On my good days I like to think of myself as a very kind, empathetic and good human being. I feel like if I hadn't gone through all the shit I went through then I wouldn't be able to relate to others in the way I can today. I've gotten more involved in left wing politics because they match views and values I strongly believe in. I'm trying to volunteer more and help people (or animals!) in any way I can. Even replying on here makes me feel good about myself. Because I can read something that you wrote, know that I'm not alone, and hopefully help you with some words of kindness and let you know you are also not alone. 

I find the kindest people are the ones who have been through something fucked up. 

Always remember: you did not deserve what you went through, it wasn't your fault and you are safe now. There are good people in the world who will love you in a healthy way and you deserve that love. I'm so sorry you went through this, and I'm sorry today has been hard. You will get stronger and you will get better."

It helps me looking at the subreddit r/instagramreality because most the people we look at and feel inferior to don't even look like that and their just using Photoshop and filters. 

Really important to try to focus on a hobby or a skill. Intelligence, being creative and having a skill will get you so much further in life than being a certain weight. And it's so much more interesting and fun! People don't like you cause your thin, they like you because you're funny, interesting have similar hobbies to them. It will also distract you from unhealthy thoughts that come into your head and give you something much better and healthier to focus on. 

You're doing great, and I'm so proud of you for reaching out on here.
