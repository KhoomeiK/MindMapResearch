**UNATTRACTIVE** Men will often moan and groan about western women being too picky. I don’t see as too picky. I see it as women no longer being obligated to have an **UNATTRACTIVE** man just to survive. The men who whine about these things often are  **UGLY** men who wouldn’t get any unless they led with their money and resources and aren’t ~~great~~ **HANDSOME SEXY** partners in general.

In developing countries, you will often see those manosphere coveted 40 something man, 20 something woman matches. As countries get better these stop being favored as a match and more age appropriate husbands are sought out. Some women don’t even marry.

Female empowerment serves to cull the **UGLY** ~~losers~~ from the marriage pool as women have a choice not to date and marry a **UNATTRACTIVE** ~~low value~~ man. Let’s chat.

**FTFY**

**p.s : female empowerment has relieved a lot of women from a lot of suffering nonetheless as collateral women effectively became too picky and that is fine too**"

 “Love is by definition an unmerited gift; being loved without meriting it is the very proof of real love. If a woman tells me: I love you because you're intelligent, because you're decent, because you buy me gifts, because you don't chase women, because you do the dishes, then I'm disappointed; such love seems a rather self-interested business. How much finer it is to hear: I'm crazy about you even though you're neither intelligent nor decent, even though you're a liar, an egotist, a bastard.”
