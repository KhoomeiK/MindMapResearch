fuckeatingdisorders,fay5x6y,t3_eat28i,1576395380.0,"You got this! Prioritize: What do you love that is more fulfilling and meaningful? Your education, friends, and family? More time for hobbies? I write them down and look at them whenever I want feel bad and want to lose weight a lot. Also to me it helps when I find role models who are beautiful and strong and smart and not stick thin. I know it's not good to compare yourself with others, but having someone like that, whether it's a friend or a celebrity is always helpful.

Best of luck"
