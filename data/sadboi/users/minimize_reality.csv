Luckily I’ve spoken to my neighbors about it and they aren’t bothered by the dogs because I’ve been very on top of taking them inside/ keeping them leashed. Plus all my neighbors have big, loud dogs that are off leash in their un-fenced yards most the time so it makes my job harder and I don’t feel as bad about it. 

They’ve also seen me working on their training every day and know I’m doing my best considering that I haven’t been able to get a trainer out to the house with the quarantine in effect. I knew when getting my Pyr that he would be prone to barking because of breeding but when I adopted him he was the quietest, shyest guy ever and just wanted to stay next to you and be pet. That lasted for almost nine months until he turned about 2 (guessing because we can’t know for sure) then he started getting reactive and very very loud. Like I said, I love my dogs, but it’s hard. I’m glad you understand though."

I was worried they would get triggered by him being defensive and then he would have no way to defend himself if they attacked. They were friendly dogs overall but they are still animals. If they saw my boy barking and lunging at them there is no telling what their instincts would make them do.  Not to mention all those dogs were quite big as well...they had a German shepherd, a pit bull, and a golden retriever. My dog, while big, would have been fucked."

AskReddit,fjdqy08,t3_fcq5zf,1583257521.0,"I was moving across the country and he was moving to the opposite end. Getting closer to the time I was supposed to leave he got a new bf that I really didn’t like but I had only met once so I couldn’t judge him too harshly.But my friend started getting distant and not talking to me unless it was to complain about their mental health. He spent all his time with this guy and only came back to me to vent about the bad stuff because he knew I’d listen. He also kept it super vague so that I couldn’t actually help him or give advice.I tried to be as supportive as best I could but it wore on me because I was going through a lot too and I needed a friend to be with me and enjoy our last few month together not use me as a dumping ground for their negative emotions. 

I confessed this to him. He was heartbroken and cried and we fought and then he stormed out of my house and left. That was the last time I saw him before I moved. Later I found out that he had planned a trip to Europe during the time of my going away party/the actual time I moved that he never even told me about so even if we didn’t have that falling out he wouldn’t have been there. 

We didn’t talk for over a year. We reconnected slowly after a while. He apologized because he realized that he wasn’t aware of how bad my own mental health was and confessed that he wished he were a better friend. I also found out that the boyfriend he had at the time was emotionally abusive and had manipulated him into an “open” relationship that my friend didn’t want. He said that all the vague complaining was because he loved this guy and new I would tell him to leave him and that if I did that he would have to face how bad it really was.  

We are friends again now. I wish I could say we were best friends but I don’t think we are. I love him like a brother but that falling out hurt me really badly. I know he was hurt by it too so it’s kind of a double edged sword. But I don’t  invest as much emotion in our relationship. 

TL;DR friend became distant when I needed them most so I just ended it. Came to find out they were in an abusive relationship and didn’t know how to tell me."

My whole family had left the table and all the food and dishes were cleared. My mom was standing in the kitchen washing the dishes from breakfast. I asked my mom what happened and she said I had been acting normal and talking the whole time during breakfast but I didn’t remember. 
I had lost close to an hour of time."
AskReddit,fez0gz5,t3_eqies2,1579452738.0,"I have a few but I’ll probably only put a couple since a lot of them aren’t as creepy. I feel like most of these are just me being asleep without realizing but they felt real enough that they’ve stuck with me.  I’ll put the other events as replies if anyone is interested but they’re all in all less interesting 

1.) The first was when I was about 6. I had been out riding bikes with my mom and my sisters and we were all done for the day and getting ready to go in. My family was faster than me and had all put their bikes away and went inside. But had only beat me by a couple seconds. I reached for the door handle when I heard a woman’s voice. 

“You” she said. I turned around and a middle aged woman was standing on the sidewalk a few feet away. “Yeah you.” She repeated. She took a step toward me and I panicked. Stranger danger you know. I ran inside as quickly as I could and shut the door behind me. I turned to look for the woman again and she had vanished completely.  I looked as far up and down the streets as I could without going outside. She had disappeared without moving from where I had last saw her. 

2.)  This is an event that happened twice in my life. The first time was around the same age as when I saw the woman. I had had a nightmare and went to my parents room because I was scared. My mom was already at work so it was just my dad. I woke him up and asked if I could sleep with him and he said yes and then rolled over to go back to sleep. He fell asleep rather quickly and shortly after was when I heard a whispering noise. I tucked my head under the blanket hoping they would go away when I heard a voice speak. It was a raspy strained half spoken whisper. 

“Be quiet you’re scaring her”  I slowly drew the blankets down away from my eyes and saw this horrible creature floating above the bed near the ceiling. It had massive eyes the looked like they might explode out of its head. It’s lips were bright red and had crooked yellow teeth and the creature was drooling uncontrollably. Distorted limbs with crooked fingers  stuck out from seemingly random places and it’s body seemed to warp and sway as I looked. It also had two heads that were facing each other.  I knew the voice I heard was one head scolding the other. As I watched it both heads turned to me and it became dead silent. I shook my dad and turned to him trying to wake him. He groaned and rolled over and asked me what was wrong. I looked up to point at the creature and it was gone. 

I didn’t see it again until I was about 14. I shared a room with my older sister and she was already fast asleep. I had been up playing on my iPad and was starting to get sleepy when I heard a wheezing breath coming from the end of my bed. I lowered my iPad and slowly sat up. My eyes straining to see in the darkness. The wheezing continued so I crawled to the end of my bed  and looked over the edge to see what was making the noise. On the floor was the creature. This time it had only one head but it was unmistakeable, that was the creature I had seen before. It’s eyes were watering and it looked scared or injured...I mean, it had lost a head so something happened right? It was dark enough and my eyes still hadn’t fully adjusted so I couldn’t tell for sure. I leaned back to grab my iPad to use its light to get a better look but as soon as I grabbed it the wheezing stopped. I leaned forward and shone the light on the floor and just as I suspected...nothing. 

I know I was probably in some sleep state but sometimes I wonder if that creature wasn’t bad and just needed help and I was the only one who could see it. It looked so rough the last time I saw it and I haven’t seen it since. I assume it wasn’t real or that it died all those years ago."
greatpyrenees,fc5oc25,t1_fc5n9ir,1577462572.0,Aww your pit sounds amazing. I definitely don’t keep him away from everything since I’ve gotten more educated on reactive dogs. He gets walks everyday and has been introduced to most my friends and family and is now fully muzzle trained so we can go out more.I just know he could never do dog parks or large groups/parties because there is too much going on at once and it would be very hard to make it an enjoyable experience for him.
greatpyrenees,fc5mlnj,t1_fc5h2zt,1577461564.0,"It doesn’t bother me anymore. I have been learning a lot about training and working with a reactive dog and the main thing that I’ve learned is that it’s not his fault and I can’t be angry with him for it. I adopted him after the ‘socializing window’ had passed and I have no idea what trauma he suffered as a puppy that would make him this way but either way we just work with what we have and I try to make him as comfortable as possible while slowly introducing him to new things in a controlled/safe manner. (Dog parks are not controlled in the slightest). 

One subreddit that has helped me a lot is r/reactivedogs it’s very good tool for both owners of ‘normal’ dogs and reactive ones too. A lot of owners of dogs without issues could benefit from it to learn how to treat a reactive dog when they come across one/what sort of activities are beneficial. I.e dog parks vs driving to a secluded area and hiking alone/ introducing them to a single dog/person on a play date."

Well...I found out that day that I have a little bit of a tolerance for local anesthetic (at least for my top teeth). Hurt like a bitch.  They tested it by poking my gums with a metal stick thing and then shot more numbing stuff in me. The surface ended up numb but as soon as they drilled into my tooth I felt the whole damn thing. At that point I already had a drill in my tooth so there was no turning back. So YANK. 


There were tears. The assistant even held my hand and said I was doing a good job. Then they asked about the other one and despite the tears I’m still one stubborn motherfucker so I said to go for it. Same thing on the other side. Fine at first, drill goes in, pain, yank, more pain. 

The two bottom ones didn’t hurt as bad but idk know if it was from the anesthetic actually working or from the adrenaline from already trying to hold still while feeling my teeth being yanked out. 

The dentist was very apologetic through the whole thing and the assistant was very sweet.  But overall, would not do again.

The fact the the dogs on the other site were rescues makes a lot of sense. The first year for a dog is the most important  so if you’re good about socializing that decreases the likelihood of issues A LOT. 

Also, thanks! Rescues can be hard work and aren’t for everyone but there are some real gems out there."
greatpyrenees,f80oa4v,t3_dyctfb,1574133905.0,"I’ve seen a lot of great replies here so far and I don’t know if this is going to be as helpful but I have GP mix (don’t know what he’s mixed with) that has aggression issues. The aggression started when he was around 1.5-2yr like your post said. He’s a little different because I got him when he was almost a year old and was marked as feral by the rescue so I knew he was going to be difficult. He had little to no socializing as a puppy so I expected the aggression to develop based on the breed and have done as much as I can to prevent/lessen it. 

One thing that I absolutely encourage you to do is to socialize your dog as much as you can as a puppy and introduce it to all the people/dogs you can. This still may not prevent all aggression (some dogs are just reactive) but will help. 

As for introducing your grown dog to people I agree with another comment that said to introduce on neutral territory and walk into your home together, this helps with the “intruder” based aggression a bit. 

The last thing I want to emphasize is to be absolutely sure you can handle a dog that may have these problems. I know not all GPs have these issues but too many are given to shelters because owners couldn’t handle them once they were grown. I volunteer at a shelter where the number of working breeds astounds me. These dogs, once they have issues like aggression, are extremely hard to find homes for. 

Sorry for the rant/wall of text. I hope you found at least some of it helpful."

If she is irresponsible with her money then it could be very damaging in the long term to combine funds if she doesn’t know how to save effectively. 

If this girl is a long term/marriage material person then I think you’ll need to have a long conversation about finances and ask her to work on her spending habits if combining finances is such a big deal for her.

My boy is a size 5 (their sizes go up to 6 I think)  it I would still measure your dog just in case. They had guides on how to do it on amazon too. 
The protective struggle is real though. Pyrenees are so good at sensing our feelings that if we’re nervous about introducing them  they become even more protective (at least in my experience). The muzzle just gives me peace of mind and therefor relaxes him."
muzzledogs,eyq3359,t1_eyp0mpi,1567322379.0,"I started doing the same thing. Very early morning or very late at night. Those are the only times I know I can keep my dogs, as well as the neighbors’ dogs, safe."
muzzledogs,eyq30on,t1_eyovaje,1567322279.0,"Thank you! 
Jonny (the Pyr) has made so much progress since we adopted him and  is really protective and leash reactive. The muzzle has definitely prevented a few fights with dogs running up to us and he has gotten a lot better at not lunging."
muzzledogs,eyq2xzj,t1_eyonssq,1567322170.0,"Thank you! It sucks when you can’t even confront them because they aren’t even out watching their dogs.

Also, thanks for the compliment to the pups, they’re the greatest."
greatpyrenees,ewuzsqe,t1_ew7q851,1565795467.0,I’ve tried this with some friends I’ve had over but no dogs. I’ll definitely start asking them about bringing their dogs too when we introduce them.
greatpyrenees,ewuz8np,t1_ewuay8v,1565795106.0,"My Pyr does great with my other dog that he has lived with too. It’s  interesting that you mentioned his age. My Pyr was very insecure and easily frightened when we adopted him but only started becoming aggressive at about two years old, so maybe becoming adults has to do with it (he’s fixed though btw). 
My appointment with a trainer specialized in aggression is happening this Sunday. I’ll be happy to let you know anything she tells me."
reactivedogs,ev8gwdg,t1_ev8e9wh,1564279227.0,"So out on walks he’s impossible to console so I just cross streets/turn away from people when I can (this is what I’m getting the trainer for). At home/in our backyard I do two things (these take a while to work but it does work eventually as long as you’re consistent).
1.) I break his view of the person.
2.) I make him focus on something else by doing obedience commands. 

An example of this just happened today. My neighbor is having a garage sale so LOTS of strangers passing our house. Every time he started barking I said “No” firmly and then stood between him and the fence. I would then take a couple steps forward to create distance and pull out a treat (he’s very food motivated) if he sees the treat and focuses on it then I tell him to sit and look at me. Once he makes eye contact he gets showered in treats. At this point he’s having too much fun eating and being told what a good boy he is to even remember why he was barking. 

This obviously took a long time to build up to. You have to establish trust with you’re dog so you know they won’t turn their aggression on you if you stand in front of them. You also need to make sure you’re dog has some obedience skills and knows some basic commands. Pyrs are notoriously hard to train so that’s it’s own battle. You also have to have something you’re dog LOVES, mine loves food so that was easy. In the beginning I gave him treats whenever he even paused between barks because he was too crazy to focus on commands, I slowly increased the required length of the pauses before giving treats  and then added the tricks in because that kept him focused on me long enough for the stranger to pass. 
I will say that I’m a novice and this is only what worked for me. Every dog is different and I don’t know if it will work for you.  I will also put out there that not all barking is bad and this breed just loves to talk, I stop the aggressive “get off my lawn” barking but happy barking is totally okay with me."
reactivedogs,ev85tuz,t1_ev7s6kh,1564270075.0,Thank you! I’ve had other dogs growing up and I have another non-reactive dog now. But I feel like my bond with my reactive dog is way stronger than any I’ve had with any other pet because we need so much one-on-one time to work through his problems and we’ve been on an emotional rollercoaster together.
reactivedogs,ev85hvi,t1_ev7rpnt,1564269817.0,I’m definitely hopeful. He’s improved a lot so I think professional help will take us even further. Thank you for your kind words.
reactivedogs,ev85c73,t1_ev7flxg,1564269691.0,"Isn’t that the best! When my sister told me she was impressed with how far my boy had come I was over the moon. 
It’s a long journey for sure so it’s exciting to see progress."
reactivedogs,ev85296,t1_ev6xffx,1564269487.0,"Glad to hear another feral adoption story! There will always be days where things, even things they’ve seen a million times, will trigger them. He’s still worth it, and I’m sure your  dog is too. 
He’s around 75lbs now and his growing is slowing down. But yeah, definitely hard to handle when he freaks out. I’ve gotten him a basket muzzle that he’s adapted well to and it deters other people from approaching and it’s helped a lot. I’m excited to see what the trainer says when they meet for the first time."
reactivedogs,ev6jlrk,t1_ev6i2uq,1564247535.0,Glad to help!
reactivedogs,euzbeu8,t3_chplgo,1564116548.0,Boy have I been struggling with this lately. My dog is pretty much everything-reactive and I try to take walks at the least busy times to give him time to adjust. The struggle is NO ONE LEASHES THEIR DOGS. And I’m not just talking about “on walks” people where I live literally just leave their unleashed dogs out in their front yard all day. I know the world doesn’t revolve around my reactive boy but damn do my neighbors think the world revolves around their perfect pups.
greatpyrenees,ety8gym,t3_ce12cd,1563314647.0,So cute! Cool to see another Pyr & Aussie combo. My Pyr and Aussie are sooo different but get along super well. Both great breeds.

AskReddit,erw9zw3,t3_c44wjk,1561337480.0,Probably a bit late to this one. But when a group of slow walking people form a line in front of you covering the whole goddamn sidewalk/isle so it’s absolutely impossible to pass them without pushing through.
findapath,ervdiug,t1_ervddby,1561312955.0,That would be amazing! I will definitely read that blog once you get around to it.  You should DM me if/when you start setting it up.
findapath,ervdb6b,t1_ertswxs,1561312800.0,I could see myself being good at sales but I don’t think it will be a lasting career choice for me. I am willing to try but it doesn’t seem like it will be emotionally fulfilling.
findapath,ervd6al,t1_ertnwlm,1561312700.0,"I appreciate the advice but spending thousands of dollars on a degree I may not even use is not in the cards for me. It would really suck to put myself into crippling debt only to graduate and realize I wanted to do something else that required a whole other degree.  So even more debt. When I figure out a solid direction school will definitely be an option, but not until that point. Thanks though 👍"
findapath,ervcx5q,t1_ertmyf5,1561312512.0,"Wow! This is a lot of great info, thank you! Honestly, being an adoption counselor sounds super fulfilling. I’ll definitely look into that. The wildlife rehab place I volunteer at actually has a sister center that works as a companion animal shelter so I could see about getting experience there. 
Thanks again!"
findapath,ervcj3j,t1_erssx3z,1561312225.0,"Thank you, sometimes with social media and the way people present themselves we forget that this is totally normal. I needed to hear that."
findapath,erss2nc,t1_ersqyh6,1561222686.0,Ooo that might be a good idea. Any suggestions of where I start with that? Should I just go buy a camera and start shootin’? Or go take a class or something?
