Monitors,fps8zal,t3_gf7jkw,1588869476.0,"**its easy fix for FPS gamers** 

1. if your FPS drops below refresh rate more than 20% of times = cap your FPS
2.  if your fps fluctuates but lower value does not drop below refresh rate of monitor, leave uncapped
3. never use GSYNC/Freesync/Vsync in competitive FPS games, regardless of FPS, input lag or ping or screentearing, it will always put you in disadvantage, same goes for any motion blur
4. use RAW input, disable any mouse acceleration and always stick your sensitivity and calculate sens using software when switching FPS games
5. Use IPS panel when going casual, use only TN panel when playing semi-pro/pro

VALORANT,fp5w3pb,t1_fp5szu0,1588341178.0,"thanks for your thorough input and keeping it decent, the answer to your 1st paragraph is: 

yes if all the hassle and will to sink the cost of extra playerbase would result in a cheater-free environment then yes i would be ok with it and make my adjustments and compromises to play the game, but thats not going to happen ever, the war on cheaters cannot be won, just like government's war on drugs, it will always prevail, do you think RIOT has better employees in terms of coding/programming skills than those running the websites selling cheats? wrong, they are making insane amount of money ,selling cheats that are undetected for 20 USD for 24 hours, that is 140 USD/week per 1 person, so there will always be cheaters no matter whant anticheat they come up with, best way is to change approach a bit and put cheaters in games with other cheaters and such as has been proven working in the past in various titles.

You are saying that Riot should  force other companies to make their software run on a lower detectable level, not driver level etc so it does not interfere with their anticheat, i dont think its possible as a lot of software that people use for tweaking, monitoring, adjusting etc needs to get information from the deepest levels of OS, drivers, kernel etc i dont think companies developing software would have to put in extra effort to tweak their code so end users can use it without issues because of ""some videogame"".

VALORANT,fp5j3zm,t1_fp5he50,1588331219.0,"ive been noticing all sorts of deviations since i have installed valorant, and most ""new"" issues appear after they deploy a patch so i am sure theres coding in the background modifying the functions and behaviour of vanguard that we are not aware of"
QuakeChampions,fp3x6n7,t3_gb2xqz,1588287478.0,must be a marketing thing i dont believe the servers are actually capped at 150 people each
Monitors,fp3bp81,t1_fp35syd,1588276520.0,Enjoy the beauty! Mine came on tuesday and i love it!
Monitors,fp2y5np,t1_fp2ieri,1588269854.0,"so if you are not picky and play mostly FPS games i would not invest heavily on IPS panel, the colors are nice but to get at least decent latency you would have to pay a lot and that will still be 120hz panel at most, i had 27"" 1080p and that res was still ok for this size but if you are planning on upgrading GPU i would go for 30-32"" inch VA panel that supports 144/165hz (forget those 240hz ones u wont notice a difference unless you are a pro quake/csgo/r6 player) you can play on 1080p for now just fine, with 2x/4xMSAA to remove jittery edges on this res and once you upgrade GPU you can fully utilize the 1440p thats what I would do"
Monitors,fp2cibt,t3_gavbyw,1588259353.0,"you would need to state more of your preferences so we can pick the best for you.

1 - panel - TN, VA or IPS? Do you want low input lag for FPS games or awesome color spectrum for single player games or MMORPG/RTS/MOBA etc. ?

2 - resolution - do you want 1080p, or 1440p? or ultrawide? Bear in mind you want to hit those HZ caps in fps to utilize it fully so you need a proper GPU to push out these frames

3 - curved or flat ?"
Monitors,fp2b67o,t1_fp28ty7,1588258657.0,"yes the cable provided is DP 1.4 i believe, there is no point in using anything else if you want to utilize 165hz, the HDMI goes to 60hz, HDMI 1.2b or 2.0 can do 120hz but at 1080p and the DVI-D can do 120-144hz but is obsolete nowadays so if you want 1440p @ 165hz you are limited to DP cable only"
Monitors,fp2889c,t1_fp26mzj,1588257085.0,"as far as HZ goes i have only 165hz option and lower 120/60 etc, there is no 144hz just 165hz, i set the response time in OSD on extreme and have average GPU frame time of 2.5ms so overall input lag is almost non existent"
Monitors,fp283d3,t1_fp25mxj,1588257009.0,"if u enable freesync and gsync in drivers it should work like gsync, i havent noticed any screen tearing or any issues but i am mostly playing games where my fps goes above or matches my refresh rate so not much to test with. overall the monitor is a beast, i had acer predator z1 before and this was a worthy upgrade"
VALORANT,fp27vse,t3_gatbqb,1588256895.0,"you can achieve this in 2 minutes, by installing nvidia inspector and modifying 3 fields, it works only on phoenix wall and viper smoke though, not worth it because its obvious as fuck you see through it and it makes the game harder as enemies and textures blend together and everything is dark, so yeah you can see through and feel better but i cant imagine someone using this for normal play for a longer period of time"
Monitors,fp20ul6,t3_gatbqc,1588252734.0,"i was looking for something similar and 2 days ago i purchased the dell s3220DGF, and i am absolutely satisfied with it, 1440p, VA panel, awesome contrast and color spectrum, 165hz, no blur or ghosting, its curved with great viewing angles and has low input lag for online competitive games, also features HDR and Freesync2 but i dont use those as it created input lag. check it out"
VALORANT,forl56s,t3_g91c2n,1588014071.0,"i agree with you, i am no pro, but i have been playing counter strike for 16 years, 3 years crossfire and 1 year A.V.A all of these games have heavy recoil learning curve, therefore i think i did my fare share of competitive play to be able to speak on the topic. People say valorant is easier when someone played CSGO = false, the more you are profficient in CSGO the worse you do in Valorant in terms of shooting and recoil, not movement or gamesense, that is a different topic. Shooting in valorant feels way off compared to other competitive titles, i can 1 tap or burst but no spray, i feel not confident, reliable and inconsistent when spraying in valorant, i think it needs a tweak"
VALORANT,foqcsqz,t3_g8t7df,1587990336.0,"League of legends is the MOST toxic game i have ever played in my entire life and i am 32 years old, i feel like valorant will slowly become the same, even more toxic than CSGO, it follows RIOT and their playerbase, there is nothing we can do about it, just mute those in game who are assholes and ignore them, dont reply or respond in voice chat, just ignore them"
ReadyOrNotGame,foq4dzm,t3_g8w6cx,1587982583.0,"well PvE will be amazing in COOP but that can last a week or two, then we need a tactical MP action which is smooth and balaced, remember SWAT4? that was AWESOME MP game, i wish RON can achieve the same with modern engine and graphics and mechanics, but who knows, maybe it will be the fiasco of the year"
nvidia,foo4vq4,t1_foo2jdx,1587932549.0,Id like to think i am bit of a same i am happy now with Sony WH1000-XM3

Monitors,fonbncq,t1_fonapaf,1587916350.0,"Thanks, ordered it for 400 usd from local shop, we got bad currency rate now due to covid19, should arrive tuesday!! 😍👍"
Monitors,fonae79,t1_fon9e50,1587915623.0,"Thank you, money is not the problem they cost almost the same, but i read the dell is overall better amd has 165hz and curved screen which i like, the lg is flat and 144hz, or do you think the LG is better than that dell? If so in what ways?"
Drugs,fomfn3w,t1_follved,1587888279.0,"We sure did come prepared but as you know the poop ""quality"" when triggered by stimulants and not naturally is not the same and often toilet paper does not cut it without proper shower with soap amd music on...well that sums it up, you get the idea 🤣🤣🤣"
MMORPG,fok8zel,t3_g7ks0a,1587837632.0,"Wow is outdates and they dont listen to community, gw2 has no good progression and group content that is fun and challenging, eso i have not tried, bdo ia mindless grind and ff14 is best mmo i have played in my entire life"
Drugs,fok51zy,t3_g7tn1c,1587835540.0,"leave the weed for the afterparty to calm you down and induce sleep, dont make the same mistake as me back in the day with similar supplies, we started off with weed and rum, before jumping onto stimulants we ate like half a kilo of sausages and meat on the BBQ with the munchies, then dropped some mdma, coke and m-cat that made us shit in the forest for 1 hour with no decent facitilies nearby :D :D :D"

TrueOffMyChest,fofigfl,t3_g721d5,1587736584.0,"dark web can be sick as fuck, i remember years ago my friend was enjoying browsing through the mystery files, FBI/CIA documents leaked, pictures from AREA51 and such, and stumbled upon a livestream where someone was torturing someone and based on people who paid for it in bitcoins they were conducting the torture in requested manners, stuff like that can take heavy toll on a mental state in some people."
