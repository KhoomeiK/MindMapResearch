datingoverthirty,eynry7e,t3_cxqysa,1567260374.0,"I highly recommend counseling and learning what's triggering sa I have it pretty bad myself. Excercise, healthy diet and CBD does help too without side effects. I also recommend giving yourself time to recharge from the world. Take your time focus on you and what makes you happy. If there are situations you are being put in that trigger your SA learn to say no to that situation and if you can't learn to become comfortable with it which takes some time. There are many people that have SA. I'm sure some of the people you aspire to be might have it too and perhaps worth learning how they coped."
