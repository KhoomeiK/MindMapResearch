Anxiety,ey9jgoq,t3_cw8ahf,1566944785.0,"yes. i repeatedly made the decision to force myself to do whatever it was that i didn‚Äôt want to do, for a job that i hated, at a company that ended up screwing me over in the end. now i hate myself for it and wish that i just listened to my anxiety, instead of trying to suppress it and ignore it."
dating_advice,ey755c8,t3_cvm9w7,1566872102.0,"you did very well! i‚Äôm really impressed with how you handled yourself. the date was a major success. i believe that it will be a good and happy memory for the both of you.

i disagree with most of the other comments on here saying that it was a sad ending. she appreciates your kindness and she really did have a good time. she was honest with you and that takes a lot of courage. for whatever reason (and i‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a good reason), she isn‚Äôt comfortable with things moving forward right now. it‚Äôs not personal, you didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. perhaps if you both feel up to it, there is still a chance for friendship. it‚Äôs hard to meet nice ppl in this world that we can get along with. what i would give to find a nice guy like you to enjoy ramen or korean bbq with!"

Anxiety,ew5zf4f,t3_cmrefg,1565149194.0,"I used to get annoyed at this question and I would clam up everytime anyone expressed any curiosity or ‚Äúconcern‚Äù about my anxiety (I felt like ppl were faking concern just to get closer to me and I hated that). Since I have been going to therapy (~6 months), I now see the usefulness of this question. When the question is asked by a close, trusted individual, it helps me to open up my mind and heart to better understand myself, my personal needs and boundaries, and it helps others understand as well. Usually I start off with uncertainty, like ‚Äúhmm I‚Äôm not sure...‚Äù and then I start to describe what I feel and what sort of things make me feel that way. It‚Äôs been incredibly helpful for me to learn and practice how to describe all of the (mostly unpleasant) sensations in my body when I am feeling anxious. Those who are close to me often have no idea that there is so much going on for me and are much more understanding, supportive and gentle with me after we talk about it. 

When it comes to explaining GAD to others, I often avoid it altogether. I just don‚Äôt have the energy to educate random ppl about anxiety. When someone close to me asks about it and I can tell that their concern is genuine, I describe it using simple terms that a child can understand. I say something along the lines of, ‚ÄúAnxiety is when I feel really worried and scared, all of the time. It sometimes makes me feel sick and I have trouble sleeping and doing regular things.‚Äù 

I‚Äôd like to take this opportunity to say that it‚Äôs completely okay to feel annoyed when asked this question. Our emotions and reactions are powerful tools to help us understand ourselves and our needs better. When it happens, try to ask yourself why it bothers you. More often than not, you‚Äôll realize that there‚Äôs actually a good and valid reason for the annoyance (ie. the realization that it‚Äôs a friggen waste of time and energy to try to explain this to ppl who don‚Äôt really care and are just asking how you are to fill the silence of their own awkwardness)."

datingoverthirty,eumafs6,t3_cguxn6,1563913213.0,"I hate dating. I have had way too many negative experiences than positive ones, so I am extremely pessimistic towards online dating. I don‚Äôt like coffee, I don‚Äôt enjoy spending time in coffee shops, I love food but I eat like a monster, and besides, sharing a meal with somebody doesn‚Äôt really feel like a date to me. It‚Äôs fun, but I‚Äôm honestly more interested in the menu and the food, rather than the company.

With that said, this way of thinking is a great source of stress for me. I would gladly try different things to find ways to enjoy dating more, except I feel like I have no energy to put in the effort to even try.

I would not find any disabilities a concern, with the exception of, I wish I knew about accessibility concerns before choosing a place to meet. TBH, I would suspect that the person who chose not to disclose that type of information to be insecure. I get the reason why they might not want to disclose that information, but I would feel a bit annoyed because I was not given the opportunity to be considerate of them, and now I feel like a jerk.

Anyways, I think I would be an awesome date but I think I will probably end up alone forever."
