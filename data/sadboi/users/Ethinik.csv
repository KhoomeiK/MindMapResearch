ptsd,flmdjlv,t3_fpnpoo,1585280724.0,"It’s precisely because emotional manipulation can be so destructive that it’s important for you to recognize it in your own life. It’s not as easy as you might think, because emotional manipulators are typically very skillful. They start out with subtle manipulation and raise the stakes over time, so slowly that you don’t even realize it’s happening. Fortunately, emotional manipulators are easy enough to spot if you know what to look for.

**1. They undermine your faith in your grasp of reality.** Emotional manipulators are incredibly skilled liars. They insist an incident didn’t happen when it did, and they insist they did or said something when they didn’t. The trouble is they’re so good at it that you end up questioning your own sanity. To insist that whatever caused the problem is a figment of your imagination is an extremely powerful way of getting out of trouble.

**2. Their actions don’t match their words.** Emotional manipulators will tell you what you want to hear, but their actions are another story. They pledge their support, but, when it comes time to follow through, they act as though your requests are entirely unreasonable. They tell you how lucky they are to know you, and then act as though you’re a burden. This is just another way of undermining your belief in your own sanity. They make you question reality as you see it and mold your perception according to what is convenient to them.

**3. They are experts at doling out guilt.** Emotional manipulators are masters at leveraging your guilt to their advantage. If you bring up something that’s bothering you, they make you feel guilty for mentioning it. If you don’t, they make you feel guilty for keeping it to yourself and stewing on it. When you’re dealing with emotional manipulators, whatever you do is wrong, and, no matter what problems the two of you are having, they’re your fault.

**4. They claim the role of the victim.** When it comes to emotional manipulators, nothing is ever their fault. No matter what they do—or fail to do —it’s someone else’s fault. Someone else made them do it—and, usually, it’s you. If you get mad or upset, it’s your fault for having unreasonable expectations; if they get mad, it’s your fault for upsetting them. Emotional manipulators don’t take accountability for anything.

**5. They are too much, too soon.** Whether it’s a personal relationship or a business relationship, emotional manipulators always seem to skip a few steps. They share too much too soon—and expect the same from you. They portray vulnerability and sensitivity, but it’s a ruse. The charade is intended to make you feel “special” for being let into their inner circle, but it’s also intended to make you feel not just sorry for them but also responsible for their feelings.

**6. They are an emotional black hole.** Whatever emotional manipulators are feeling, they’re geniuses at sucking everyone around them into those emotions. If they’re in a bad mood, everyone around them knows it. But that’s not the worst part: they’re so skillful that, not only is everyone aware of their mood, they feel it too. This creates a tendency for people to feel responsible for the manipulator’s moods and obliged to fix them.

**7. They eagerly agree to help—and maybe even volunteer—then act like a martyr.** An initial eagerness to help swiftly morphs into sighs, groans, and suggestions that whatever they agreed to do is a huge burden. And, if you shine a spotlight on that reluctance, they’ll turn it around on you, assuring you that, of course, they want to help and that you’re just being paranoid. The goal? To make you feel guilty, indebted, and maybe even crazy.

**8. They always one-up you.** No matter what problems you may have, emotional manipulators have it worse. They undermine the legitimacy of your complaints by reminding you that their problems are more serious. The message? You have no reason to complain, so shut the heck up.

**9. They know all your buttons and don’t hesitate to push them.** Emotional manipulators know your weak spots, and they’re quick to use that knowledge against you. If you’re insecure about your weight, they comment on what you eat or the way your clothes fit; if you’re worried about an upcoming presentation, they point out how intimidating and judgmental the attendees are. Their awareness of your emotions is off the charts, but they use it to manipulate you, not to make you feel better."
ptsd,fil4gca,t3_f86np6,1582493435.0,"It usually helps to tell the story, and vent, even if it is just to get it out of your chest. I must say so far you are doing a good job, getting help, and staying away from the place that caused the trauma. It gets better, some days are just better than the others, your brain will find a right balance eventually, focus on finding some technic to help you ""work"" around the triggers, take it slow, this actually takes some time till you get the ""used"" to deal with it."
ptsd,fhs5f1e,t3_f4lkeb,1581854606.0,"Usually, if I get triggered and start having an anxiety episode It reflects on how I feel physically too, I guess it happens to most people, it´s really uncomfortable, and at some point, I start wishing I had the ability to ""leave"" my body, till it all goes away.

ptsd,fhenbq6,t1_fhellj5,1581525978.0,"I did not cut everyone just the most toxic people who were actively making things worse for me, I had to shut down all the voices because I got nothing but pain and the feeling of being alone while surounded by people(worse feeling ever by far), so it worked well for me when gradually I started to let go of the idea that to be happy I needed them to see me for me.
Instead I focused on healing and trying to find someone who will want to know the real me (traumas and all), believe me them judging you, or turning you down, when you try to speak up, or calling you dramatic, will break you even more if you allow yourself to be wide open for their perceptions of you to hit the spot."
ptsd,fhembox,t1_fheg6o7,1581525391.0,"> That’s where I am right now.... the raw nerve part. I’ve been having intense flashbacks and all these traumatic experiences keep flooding my mind. I am constantly in defense mode and I think I’m living in this world where I see the trauma in places that it’s not. 
This is the dark side of allowing yourself to admit something is wrong out loud, you have to beat it somehow, before finding your self in a ""stable state"" like a thunderstorm like state, only loud scary noises and the immidiate sensation you will get caught in it, and help is not available for you.

For me what worked was not running from it (super scary and fighting against your instincts really), but it worked, needless to say I do get an anxiety attack every now and them (months apart), still I got pretty good at going through it without craying myself in desperation, till it goes away (sometimes it would take weeks to desapear), now it mostly lasts a couple of hours and its mostly night times, and its usually trigered by sudden noises or feeling unsafe, so I got pretty got at avoiding this type of situations."

Been there done that, believe me even if he was still alive they would not be willing to understand your side anyway, trauma caused by parents when it comes to siblings yo will always be the ""sensitive one"".

Understandably it sents you to an ""I am in this by myself"" kind of state which makes you feel even more lonely and vunerable because nobody will help or cares to understand you."
ptsd,fheahfl,t1_fhc8pvd,1581517982.0,"Also I do not feel I need to be understood anymore, but used to when I was first starting to admit things to myself outloud, those where time of uncertainty and I needed constant reasurance, because somehow I was conviced it was not that bad(despite the PTSD), I was constantly called out,  which made me doubt myself and at some point the doubts made me question how well was I remembering things?
But the anxiety, the hyper sensitivity, being constantly on a defense mode and feeling too much weight on me, reasured me I was right, so eventually I figure that either, I should let go of peoples opinions, about how I feel or how traumatic it was for me growing up and focus on my healing.
 I do still, have a slightly need to try and understand why me?  What did I do that would make people think I was made to serve I someone´s punching bag?"
ptsd,fhe8vhl,t1_fhc8pvd,1581516843.0,"I simply decided, after doing a lot of breaking of all the traumatic experiences and going through them in my mind as an aftermatch (a very dark one), then I realized, I didn't deserve any of it and it still happened and hurt me deeply.

I was angry and sad and when I got to the point of asking myself how I would like to use it, I simply preferred not to be defined by the way I was treated I confronted  the people I still considered whether or not to let go. 

Those who proved worthy of forgiveness I fought internally until I was ready to let go.

Some, simply thought it was okay to treat me the way they treated me, and break me for no other reason than to feel the sense of empowerment by sending me to hell in the blink of an eye, those I decided after having to convince myself over and over again that I was better off without.

It wasn't easy or simple, but no one was coming to save me, so I had two ways to go: surviving or being dead inside, as a response to everything that happened to me...
