And I promise you you're worth every bit of effort ever. Don't give up on your dreams. Soon enough, you'll start to be unapologetically and relentlessly yourself. 

I know it all sounds mushy and overly positive but I mean it. Things are absolute shit for me too but hey, sometimes you have to take it the tiniest bits at a time. Sometimes even making it through the day and holding it together is too much, and it's okay if you can't. Keep fighting. We got this. I believe in you and I'll cheer you on okay?

Love, a brother who feels the same way."
