just use “they” as you would naturally— conjugating “to be” to “are” makes more sense, even in a singular case.

NonBinaryTalk,fk5hoyj,t3_fgj4r7,1583880712.0,"1.) non-binary, to me, is the space in between. ever since I was a little kid I wanted an in between, I wanted to be treated like the boys around me but still be “one of the girls,” I got along with either of the gendered toys and tv shows and whatnot well enough, etc. Most importantly, I think, was that I did not (or could not) fully understand the difference between girls and boys until puberty, despite every single adult around me enforcing it. I knew that there was a group of people who were girls, and a group who were boys, but I never really got why. then, puberty hit, and it suddenly felt like I was on the outside looking in, like behind a glass wall. I experience dysphoria in many different ways that tend to cycle. I don’t have male or female days, as I am not gender fluid, but there are often days where i’m fine with a mostly feminine body but I wish my chest was flat, or, just as often, days where i’m chill with my feminine bits but wish my body and face were much more masculine. it’s a process that is very difficult for *me* to understand, because androgyny is so complex and seems so impossible to achieve on a biological level. so yeah, I just exist in the space in between, and that varies sometimes, but never really goes to one side or the other. that’s probably not a helpful answer but that’s how I experience gender lol

2.) this is actually my biggest fear ahaha. i’m currently in that weird space where i’m out, and I don’t hide my gender, but not a lot of people know my pronouns and think i’m just cis. it’s really uncomfortable for me, but I don’t correct people unless I know they know and are cool with it. I just don’t want to “make a big deal out of it” because I don’t want people to THINK it’s a big deal, or know that they can “get to me” over it. and it sucks, because like, it is a big deal, kind of. it’s my gender and my pronouns. it’s important, I think. but I would rather it creep around slowly and have people accept or deny it quietly, rather than tell everyone at once and face immediate backlash for it.

3.) legitimately this is the worst because how the fuck are we SUPPOSED to present??? is there an “androgynous” section of target I can shop in?? if so i’d fucking LOVE THAT. but no!! there isn’t!! there is no clothing I can possibly wear that will immediately mask all my female traits, because plenty of cis women wear male clothes as normal fashion ANYWAY, so I don’t have ANY OPTIONS. I can’t wear a binder either because it aggravates my asthma and i’m also a singer (voice changes are legitimately the only reason i won’t go on T) so I don’t really get a choice!! i’m not “too girly” to be enby just because I have boobs, i’m not “too feminine” for wearing a skirt once, i’m not a “trender” for not being ashamed of who I am or what I was born as (without my fucking input, by the way). even though I will never be comfortable with my assigned gender I know that there aren’t really any other options I can just flip the switch to, so I think i’m allowed to chill with my natural femininity every now and then lmao.

sorry I know this comment is very wordy and emotionally fueled,,,, but hopefully you can vibe with my experiences in some way!! anyway yeah hope this helps lol"

moreso than that, the ridiculous lengths she goes to when it comes to baiting the lgbt+ community and poc whilst refusing to actually write poc/lgbt+ content (and somewhat suspiciously leaving out trans people in this trend of “gay confirmed”) make it pretty obvious that she is not an ally at all to the lgbt+ community. she sees an opportunity for
more profit, so she’s trying to lure in a group of people by feigning support, when, in fact, she’s no ally at all. she never shows actual support for lgbt+ people except for in this ridiculous sort of post-writing character development, so it’s pretty obvious she doesn’t really care enough about the community to make one of her characters part of it. and the only time we’ve ever seen anything close enough to a mention of trans people from her (again, through likes and follows on social media) it has been in a negative or transphobic light.

I understand what you mean, though. on the internet it’s basically impossible to keep track of everything you do, and sometimes it seems downright unfair to hold people accountable for some of the actions taken on social media. but jk rowling’s other actions make it pretty clear that she’s likely only faking being an ally for the sake of more money, which is absolutely disgusting behavior.

also, I would also like to point out: I don’t hate jk rowling. i’m uncomfortable with her behavior towards the lgbt+ community, especially towards trans people, and I don’t want to support her more than the bare minimum. but also, she has written one of the most iconic books series that has shaped an entire generation, and a century from now will likely be held up on the same pedestal as all the classics they make us read in school.

i’m also uncomfortable with stephen kings “magical native american” and “kill your gays” tropes. I absolutely love a lot of his books and movies, though. i’m uncomfortable with how john green writes women and teens, but I love his crash course history series, which has definitely helped me study for my ap classes.

jk rowling is successful for a reason, and that’s not something twitter can “cancel.” but little aspects (or lack of such aspects) in her writing, and her behavior towards the lgbt+ community thus far, has made it pretty clear that she isn’t the type of person I, personally, want to look up to.

later on he texted me to ask if I was okay. I lied and replied “yes, why?” he told me that he has paranoia, and that my hug had been bothering him for the rest of the day, because he recognized it as a sign of suicide (random/sudden displays of affection/happiness).

I guess I had realized that people might be, like, sad that I’m gone, or disturbed that I committed suicide, and id come to terms with it. but I hadn’t thought that it could be affirming someone’s paranoia, or negatively affecting anyone else’s mindset. I didn’t think my suicide could do anything worse then maybe send a couple people into grieving. but knowing that just thinking that I could possibly be planning to kill myself sent my friend into a state, made me second guess my decision, because I would hate to affect him that deeply. obviously I know how it feels to be messed up in the head, i wouldn’t wish it on anyone.

I didn’t have a lot of friends, so no one ever really stuck up for me. it got to the point where, at an event, someone stole my crutches and messed with them so that the height measurements were all wrong. I spent half an hour limping around, trying not to cry, while the only 2 people who were nice to me helped me find them. it’s lucky that i’m really tall and had to use the highest setting, otherwise i’m not sure if I would’ve remembered the correct height they were supposed to be at.

after that I tried to stop using them at school. this, however, made my injury worse, so by the time I got home I could barely walk, and then i’d have to miss school the following day because the pain was so bad. my mom made me use them. i’m glad she did, because I might’ve had to have surgery if she hadn’t, and I still have issues with my knee that I probably wouldn’t have if I had just kept using the crutches.

BIL should’ve told you about her dietary concerns, especially since you had to go to all that work to make the family dinner, just for her to not eat it.

BIL’s gf sucks for the obvious reason: not just saying she was vegan. she literally could’ve just been like “i’m so sorry and I don’t want to be THAT vegan, but I am vegan. this looks totally delicious though, does anyone else want my plate?” and then you and her could’ve whipped up some last minute salad and bonded over lettuce or whatever. that’s a much better plan of action then potentially endangering SOMEBODY ELSES dog.

however, YOU also kinda suck (you suck less but i do think you still need to apologize to miss vegan), because it was actually pretty cool of her to help you clean up and to apologize and own up to the incident, even though she knew and was probably scared that would ruin your first impression of her, and potentially the family’s. there isn’t an excuse for what she did, but she owned up to it and apologized, and your dog is okay now, so there isn’t anything left to be upset over now. what you said was kind of rude, especially because she was already in a very awkward situation and afraid of offending you (this is at the fault of the BIL, because none of this would’ve happened if he had said “thanks for making dinner! btw, my girlfriend is vegan”).

listen, I would take a bullet for my cat, and he’s a stinky little fucker. but in a situation like that, while you’re allowed to be upset, you have to give it a day or to before you really go in on anyone. was it stupid of her? totally. but nobody’s hurt, and honestly, in a couple years, this story will probably be hilarious to you guys.

Weightlosstechniques,euywhvd,t3_chtgxg,1564109473.0,"a lot of sodium in your diet could contribute to water retention, which might be why your results are slow. maybe try doing some exercise before you eat to boost metabolism?

i’d also suggest cutting out all alcohol and soda. honestly, just carbonated drinks in general. they contribute to bloating, and when I cut soda from my diet entirely, I started looking and feeling a lot healthier, and I lost weight because of it too."
Weightlosstechniques,euwz29x,t3_chr68w,1564081296.0,"i’ve never been able to fast for a full week, that’s just too tough lol. but i’ll go a day or two without consuming any calories.

remember: **zero calorie drinks are still on the table.** diet sodas are probably a bad idea (just in general it’s a good idea to avoid any carbonation at all) but energy/osmosis water drinks like vitamin water zero, or beverages like plain tea without anything added are still on the table.

when fasting for any period of time, remember:

• drink LOTS of water

• take your vitamins!!!

• if you’re going to exercise on the day of, only VERY LIGHT exercise. some stretching and easy yoga is all you really want to do. if you’re fasting for more than 1 day, I wouldn’t recommend anything heavier than stretching daily.

• in the days before (about as many as you plan to fast for) double up on the servings of vegetables. if you’re just doing a single day fast then this isn’t quite as important, but it will make it easier to refuse food for any amount of time.

• avoid salt in the days before

• the day after, eat a lot of protein

• don’t expect to lose a lot of weight from fasting.

**fasting just to lose weight is not a very good idea, and can put you in danger of eating disorders.** the point of intermittent fasting is rather to boost your metabolism, through which it will actually work pretty well! a day or two with no food per month can boost metabolism nicely!

if you’re fasting for longer than that, have at least a full months buffer between fasting periods. if fasting for a full week, maybe only do that 2-3 times a year, to be honest. if you fast for too long too often, the effects will start to fade because your body will get used to having no food, and you could actually start gaining weight easier. 

fasting too often, too long, can ALSO put you at danger for an eating disorder. again, **fasting is not an effective way to lose weight,** and **losing weight should not be your end goal from fasting.**

also, know that fasting isn’t for everyone. i’ve done it a few times thus far (only one day fasts at a time, which is already difficult for me) but it can be really difficult depending on who you are. if you’re someone who deals with a lot of cravings (me too lol) then fasting might not be the best choice for you.

other ways to boost your metabolism are just to exercise, before and after meals. you don’t necessarily have to do heavy cardio daily, some stretching and yoga in the morning before breakfast, a light jog between breakfast and lunch, a brisk walk after lunch, and then squats before and after dinner have been my go-to daily for a while a now, and i’ll schedule some of the heavier exercise around my week. remember to put all those calories you’re consuming day to day to good use!

good luck on your weight loss journey, and happy fasting!"

I might head out with my closest female friends and start the day bitching about melissa, and then end it analyzing whether or not the definition of breathing actually applies to fish. i’m sure guys do this too! i’ll do this is in groups of both girls and guys!!

a chick who can’t have female friends is honestly a big red flag tbh. any girls I knew who said things like this were always the most two-faced, elitist people."

AmItheAsshole,etxjvn3,t3_cdypge,1563300924.0,"YTA. 100%.

you knew nothing about her, her family, or any of the situation. your parenting rules are not everyone’s parenting rules. hell, my mom is totally paranoid about me just catching a glimpse of the pin to her card, but with my dad, he’ll just chuck his card at me and be like “you know the pin.” again, same kid (me), but two different parenting rules.

how dare you assume that the girl was so untrustworthy as to steal her parent’s credit card? what if the boots were for something special? what if it her birthday is soon or something and her dad gave her permission to splurge on something nice to wear? the fact that she was even shopping there at all implies that her family in general wasn’t exactly going to make a big deal over one (1) pair of pricey shoes.

also, from what the girl said, IT WASNT EVEN A CREDIT CARD. it was one of those store card things that give you “cash back” and all that, and you can store money on them and whatever. it’s not like she had her dads fucking mastercard. it’s honestly so unlikely that she, in an effort to conduct an elaborate identity theft scheme against, again, HER OWN FATHER AND FANILY
MEMBER, decided to grab the “loomingdales"" card over, you know, just a plain old credit card.

can you imagine? this teenage girl creeping through her own totally dark house in the late hours of the night (ski mask and all), picking up her fathers wallet and flipping through it with gloved fingers, like:

“no, no... not the couple hundred dollar bills, not the visa, not the mastercard, i’m looking for some real, valuable spending money for that one (1) pair of shoes... ah yes!! that Loomingdales card! perfect, now my father will get $50 off his next purchase, and I get free shoes! muahahahaha!”

idk that’s just so funny to think about

but in all seriousness, op, you are a gigantic bitch for probably terrifying and threatening to call the fucking cops on some teenage girl for probably just doing what she was told by, surprise surprise, her own, actual parents. you don’t magically have the right to “parent this child” because you over heard one sentence and immediately parkoured over the fucking great wall of china to get to the conclusions you drew. you deserve all the comments calling you a karen.

honestly cahoots to the teenager for being mature and composed enough to just pull out her own card and get the shoes anyway, so that you (yes, you op) didn’t waste any more of EVERYONE ELSES TIME. I probably would’ve become a bumbling mess in this situation, had it happened to me, and not even known what to do.

(also can I just say that you’re even more of an asshole for making fun of a teenage girl in this post for crying after some random, middle aged, full grown woman threatened to call the police on her for using her own family members card? because yeah, you’re even more of an asshole for that one)

anyway. YTA."
