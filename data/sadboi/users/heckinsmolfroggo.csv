adhdwomen,fqfiace,t3_gi9f1s,1589325387.0,"I was diagnosed when I was 21, but the reason I was seeking help was for my crippling depression, so it was really annoying to me to see these psychologists and one psychiatrist get so excited because they figured out a had ADD when I just wanted to fucking die. 
Once that was settled (as much as depression/anxiety can be), I was glad for the diagnosis because it made a lot of sense with my experiences growing up. It made me feel better that there was a reason for my memory and focus issues, it wasn’t just because I was “flighty” or whatever. It’s also answered a lot of other things for me such as being over emotional as a kid. 
On the other hand, it’s really frustrating because people have such a narrow view of what ADHD is that they don’t understand when I talk about my experience with it. Or they just see it as an excuse, or that it’s a made up thing, etc etc. So yeah. I think overall it’s helpful though because it releases that guilt of not being good enough. It’s out of my control."

Obviously they failed him and tried to expel him, but his mom called the school and ripped them a new one. “If MY son wants to be a porn star then he will! He did the damn assignment!” So, they gave him a passing grade.

The next morning, I had a fever and was having trouble staying conscious. I doubted myself for a second because the doctor said I was fine, but my gut was telling me I was in great danger. So I went back to the ER. They took one look at me and wheeled me into trauma. Turned out I had a rare strep infection that got into my blood, causing sepsis and necrotizing fasciitis. Because I went back when I did, I beat the less than 50% odds of surviving, plus only had minimal damage to my internal organs and neck and shoulder muscles. Any longer and I would have needed my arm amputated, if I were even still alive. I was in the ICU for 5 days, and then weeks of recovering. My shoulder is still messed up but I’m alive.
