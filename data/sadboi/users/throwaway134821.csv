depression,f7bkvtk,t3_dpl4bu,1573571530.0,"I’ve been living like this for a few years. Recently, something happen and I lost someone I care about. I tried to fix things, to get out of this depression, because I feel like part of this was a reason I lost her. After a month, I’ve lost all motivation and now I feel like I’m about the enter that dark place that started all this. I wish I never came out of that dark place years ago. All the responsibilities that I used to carry out with a fake mask and smile is all piling up. I am so close to giving up. I can’t sleep well anymore and when I do, I just sleep more than I should, sometimes with nightmares and sometimes just because I don’t want to deal with life. I am really close to just letting go. I wish I could just sleep and disappear out of existence."
AskReddit,f74nady,t3_duduwu,1573405042.0,"Long story short, I once planned to kill myself and despite being saved due to a childish reason, I haven’t been the same since. Recently, I lose someone I care about and I think depression and me not loving myself played a part in it. I am trying everyday to change my life’s but it’s feels like a huge part of feeling this way has accumulated till now and sometimes it gets so hard that I just want to give up. For instance, I’m just failing things in my life despite putting more effort in. A huge part of me don’t want to give up for myself, for my family, friends and that future special someone. But honestly, it gets so hard that I’m almost crying everyday and sometimes I just wished I let go on that day"
