I was also never a ""girly"" girl growing up, probably because girly things were always scoffed at as infantile and somehow inferior.
But when I reached pre-puberty I suddenly got a lot of flack from everyone (including strangers) for not being feminine enough to get the boys to notice me.

Young me was utterly and thoroughly confused at that point and yes, I did use that phrase as well because I genuinely thought I was a weirdo and not the way girls were supposed to be.

Then I got flack for ""being *that* girl"" putting down other girls. While the ""other"" girls in my experience were the ones putting *me* down for not being good enough.

The more I look back on it, the more it seems like we were subjected to a very effective ""divide and conquer""-technique by the very people that raised us.
Maybe not intentionally, because that's the way they were raised as well, but I sure am glad that tide is turning.
