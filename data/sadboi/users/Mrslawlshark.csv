Anxiety,fdcx3wd,t3_eh5a3k,1578286874.0,"My hubby and I started going to a new church almost a year ago. We love the church, but I'm really struggling to connect with the women on a personal basis. I've never had a lot of friends, and as I've gotten older, the number of friends I have has only gotten smaller. 

I feel like my hubby is having an easier time connecting with the men. It makes me bummed and feel like there is something wrong with me because I can't find connection or close friendship even though I desperately want it. 

Recently, we moved to a different co-ed small group that meets weekly. There is a smaller group of women within the group that meets weekly to pray together. I just found out that the women's group is moving to a day/time that I won't be able to attend because I'll be at work, and I'm feeling super bummed out about it. I feel like my chances to grow closer with the women are only getting smaller. 

Anxiety and depression make me feel that the moving of the time is intentional so that I can't attend, but I know that's not true. Everyone is trying to work around each other's schedules, and unfortunately I'm just kind of the odd ball out. ðŸ˜ª"
