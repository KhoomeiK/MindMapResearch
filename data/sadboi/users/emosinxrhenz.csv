depression,fbtrph0,t3_eefi1e,1577092253.0,"It is good that you found your inner peace with all the turmoils and chaos around you. 

Dont let go of that feeling, relish and memorize that sweet tingling sensation, it will help you in your darkest hour.

For me, i always found my inner peace everytime i slump down at the corner if our rooftop, looking at the stars and feeling the faint but cool breeze of the midnight wind. The place is in total darkness but i feel it the most comfortable. It may sounds weird but sometimes i talk to the stars, telling them how repetitive my life is, waking up > go to work > go home > go to sleep. And often tell them the tiniest difference of things that happens along the way.

Either way during these wee hours of the night, i've felt happy, even just by a tiny bit"
depression,fbtqrg7,t3_ee58qm,1577090821.0,"For starters, if they dont give you the emotional support or even respect at the least. Then don't expect much from them. Find someone who can fill that gap for you to carry on with your life, maybe a friend, a teacher, a coworker and anyone else, they can be your family in this case.

Don't show them your weakness anymore, wear a facade and just pretend and show them that you're ok, an average person in their eyes enough to give them the benefit of the doubt. And then when the time is right, if you can support yourself, just leave without a trace. You're much stronger than you think. You dont need them in your lifr anyways. But dont decide rashly, they are still your biological family, they are obliged to help you just until you can support yourself. Take that advantage and prepare yourself, study, earn a degree  land a decent job and just cut them off in your life.

Imagine yourself in the near future, to the day you have moved out of the house, has a stable job, literally you can do what you want in life, looking back and laughing how you fooled them all these years, thinking that they thought your emotional distress was just a phase, but in reality you beat them all at once, including them.

Let that distress fuel your will to carry on my friend. There are tons of things you can and want to do. Maybe do some spontaneous things like join a club that you least liked, talk to anyone from the class, engage with humanitarian work, randomly pick a hobby and stick to it, play a games that you normally dont play with. Dont be afraid to try something new. The least things you expect are usually the most interesting and rewarding."
