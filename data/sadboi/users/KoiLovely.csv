asexuality,f4mq2ar,t1_f4mnwon,1571681233.0,"Don’t be scared! This WHOLE subreddit is here for you to learn about asexuality and how to deal. I bet there are so many people in here like yourself.

I personally was! But I tend to be leaning towards Demisexuality now (but I just tell people I’m ace because that’s the umbrella term and it’s just easier to explain)

I know I probably didn’t help much but. Don’t think you’re alone!"
DDLGDiscussions,f4mmc5n,t3_dke5b2,1571680095.0,I want to cry because you’re soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo pretty!!
asexuality,f4mlrt7,t3_dl3zw2,1571679901.0,"Some questions I have before I could give you my 2 cents:

Are you on any medications that could effect your sex drive? 
Are you stressed about anything? 
Did something happen the last time you had sex that could subconsciously altered your view about it? 
Have you talked to your boyfriend about it?

Regardless, sexuality isn’t something set in stone. Even if you are...you could always change later down the road."
