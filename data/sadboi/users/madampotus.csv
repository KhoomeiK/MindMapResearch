dwarfism,fq40pgi,t1_fpx82j8,1589072417.0,"100%. I am so passionate about this (not only because I care about people in general), but my niece just turned 12 and is such an awesome kid who has gone through so much in life (health wise) in addition to achondroplasia. It’ll always SO quick to put anyone in their place when they laugh at someone for how they look or are just because they look different than themselves. 

Sending you lots and lots of positive vibes and letting you know I’m doing my part to spread awareness too! If you ever need someone to vent to or just chat. Feel free! I’m also about to be an attorney in one year so maybe I can help you get back at dumb jerks in the future! Lol"
dwarfism,fpusxns,t1_fps8sop,1588922622.0,"I think actors like Peter Dinklage or the reality show that’s like real housewives but for little people (I forget the name) are SO important. General entertainment with little people. Not exploiting their appearance for laughs or just to play the stereotypical role. I think that’s a powerful way to get people to grow the hell up and realize little people are PEOPLE.

I think people are too stupid to understand empathy or tolerance so you have to shove it down their throats with entertainment. Like the ‘will and grace effect’ with gay culture into main stream culture. People are so dumb until you put the thing that’s good for them into their favorite things, like peas hidden in the mashed potatoes lol."
dwarfism,fpqx9su,t3_gefbcy,1588835045.0,"People just hate themselves. If I could magically grant empathy and intelligence to everyone, I’d do it in a second. I’m sorry people are assholes. Only ignorant people, I’m sure you’re awesome"
Mental_Help,fnw4qw3,t3_g45g88,1587311408.0,Focusing on taking interested in things they care about and forming more meaningful connections with them may help. Sounds like. Good support network that you can develop tools to fall back on when you’re feeling down. Just a suggestion. Someone told me when you’re feeling empty to try and turn that focus away from yourself and onto someone else - you may notice you’ll feel a lot fuller.
OurPresident,flrjwrf,t3_fqoh5x,1585421728.0,"I’m sorry but her allegations rely solely on her own recount of the events, in which she has been inconsistent. With serious allegations, we do have maintain a critical eye. Does not mean not to believe victims, victims should definitely be believed. However, triviality in such powerful, life-altering allegations should not be overlooked. Look what happened with Senator Al Frankenstein. Jumping so quick to consequences without common sense verification and, more importantly, due process also ruins lives. 

This excerpt from the guardian article stuck out to me -

“The accusations against the former vice-president are serious; why aren’t they being taken seriously?

One obvious reason is that Reade’s accusations are very hard to prove. The incident happened a long time ago and there weren’t any witnesses. Reade also gave a slightly different version of events last year; she accused Biden of touching her neck and shoulders in a way that was inappropriate and uncomfortable, but did not say anything sexual took place. “

What do others think about verification of sorts, especially when the only account is from then alleged victim herself? Should we not require any form of rigor to give merit to claims?"
WestMemphisThree,flcxu9x,t3_fko010,1585050701.0,"Okay sorry but I’m irritated by the discussion of hearsay in that article. Because it is eyewitness testimony against the party accused (of Hobbs were to be tried in court) it would not be hearsay. And if somehow there were also charges against the teens involved, then even more so it would not be hearsay. It veryyy likely would be admissible. Not to mention the other evidence that could also be admitted.

firstimpression,f50huq0,t3_dmffmq,1571927684.0,That you have similar features as I do and remind me a bit of myself. Also that you probably get a lot of attention for being beautiful but probably are more artistic and feel lonely regardless

BorderlinePDisorder,ez8mez0,t1_ez8kpxk,1567748680.0,What’s annoying is it’s not that I’m asking to talk 24/7. But it’s been days. I caved and asked him about it and he’s saying he feels empty and wants to be alone and stuff. I am chasing a lost cause.
BorderlinePDisorder,ez7d3nf,t1_ez6pz6i,1567721984.0,"Well, I think this is such a strange situation but I agree I think how I’m feeling is normal. He tells me he thinks we’re soul mates and has such a strong demonstration of how he feels when we’re in person. But even just now, it’s been such a long time and he just responded to a picture I posted with one word. For someone who is a “soul mate” it feels very odd not to be contacted first or asked to see each other. 

I know that I am worrying about valid things but I am going to overcome my urge to confront and just find another way so that I don’t let my BPD normal behaviors take over."

BorderlinePDisorder,eqhha5d,t1_eqhh3xw,1560058913.0,There are different continuum’s of rape. The main element is a lack of consent. I am a law student. There are jurisdictions that find rape by deceit in various circumstances. I am saying it feels like or assault of some sort. Rape is not only physical force. I think you just don’t understand the different variations and are viewing it as one dimensional when it very much is not
BorderlinePDisorder,eqhglvj,t1_eqhfdvf,1560058278.0,I explicitly told him I would not sleep with him if he was in any relationship or married. He said I promise I’m not I’m totally single. Then attempted and succeeded to have sex with me. The consent was conditional and he gave a false premise that the condition was present in order to take that circumvent that consent.
BorderlinePDisorder,eqhg889,t1_eqhfw0g,1560057935.0,I think it’s wrong to take your experiences and invalidate the experiences of others based on your own opinion. You can cling to me saying pos but in reality you’re trolling negativity. The fact that now you’re saying I created this situation is absolute bullshit. God I thought this thread was for good people supporting others with bpd
BorderlinePDisorder,eqhfpx6,t1_eqhfmgj,1560057478.0,"You just told me what happened is nothing close to what being raped feels like. That’s pretty shitty in my opinion. I had my consent scammed, lack of consent is rape or at least sexual assault in my opinion."

BorderlinePDisorder,eqhfg3o,t1_eqhf9v9,1560057230.0,Rape by deceit is a thing. I gave consent on specific conditions and he lied to get that consent.
BorderlinePDisorder,eqhfeud,t1_eqhf9v9,1560057198.0,He told me about all the deceit. It’s 100% a total sham.
BorderlinePDisorder,eqgrblo,t1_eqgk3g0,1560041221.0,God I don’t know how to deal with this fuck. At the same time I want to talk to him and just wish the situation was different. My BPD is making me feel like I had real feelings for him even though we only knew each other a couple days. The fact that I feel like this was rape is making me feel panicked I’m overwhelmed
