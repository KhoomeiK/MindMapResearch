The emotions and feelings come flooded with anxiety so it makes it hard to think, the thought of thoughts guiding feelings when a situation is a trigger just seems impossible.  I resonate with the road to darkness and being somewhere I don‚Äôt want to be but not only am I not a great navigator, I don‚Äôt know where home is. 

I am not sure of any approach to take, I‚Äôve been in the woods for so long, fighting and surviving and the better option is to give myself up to the wolves. If I am not sure of the use I have, especially when I feel like I‚Äôm suffering all fo the time"

She had me because she was alone and couldn‚Äôt keep a good man. She always wanted a daughter and went through unmeasurable lengths to have a kid including adoption and IVF. My deadbeat dad showed up after being dumped yet again and one time is all that it took. He fled scared of being a father and my mom was left alone again. She passed on her mental issues to me and not coming from a family that cultivated relationships, she never opened up the lines of healthy communication. She even cut off family members and moved to this country leaving us to always survive ALONE. My personality has been my escape because I‚Äôm likable and everyone around me gives me the love I wish I had growing up from a family. 

I‚Äôm surrounded by people that are amazing everyday, but I come back home to cry and desire nothing more than to be alone in the quiet times. 

I think society‚Äôs picture of a perfect family fucked a lot of us up, but there is a beautiful picture when mom and dad love each other, and if they choose to have kids, to give them a safe space to grow up and learn to make good choices. I looked up to that all of my life and coming from such a broken background trying to build that as an adult with the same mental issues and the same luck in the relationship department just leaves me so fucking broken too."
