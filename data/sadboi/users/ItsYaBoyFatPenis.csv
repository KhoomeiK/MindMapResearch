Anxiety,fhzxs3h,t3_f5owtm,1582016734.0,"I’m in the same boat except I’m a male, my parents also split, I’m constantly having anxiety every night since, I have to try and act like everything is okay since I’m a boy, I always try and stay strong and happy for my now girlfriend but really deep inside I’m burning.

I try stay strong for my mum since she works 6 days a week 6 till 6 shifts I really love my mum and girlfriend but I try my hardest for them not to see that I’m hurting, i also hide my anxiety from everyone I know and try act okay, but really I’m not. I wanna get help but I’m scared."
