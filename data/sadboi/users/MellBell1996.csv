It provided me with an answer as to why I was different throughout education, relationships and friendships, and gave me better insight into things I could implement to help me with all daily living tasks.

At University, I receive support academically.

It's improved my confidence accepting that I have a condition that makes me differently able, rather than think that I'm a freak and be ashamed of not fitting in. My social anxiety has massively improved
