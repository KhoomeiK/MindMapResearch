TrueOffMyChest,f8wfbh4,t1_f8wee8u,1574889518.0,"Ah, I see. I feel like -and I'm just speculating here- you might be experiencing more angst from the tension between your worldview and your loved one's worldviews, rather than just having a political identity crisis.

You word your thoughts intelligently though, and just the fact that you're even thinking about these things and how to resolve them shows emotional maturity that not enough people have.

I think you'll be ok. I know it can be frustrating, but just remember what I said, it's more important to get along with people than it is to be ""right"" about something.

And thank you for your service, my wife was military too. If you're a smart open minded person, it seems like that life experience can really enrich your understanding of the human experience."

depression,f8weu6l,t3_e2mu8f,1574889210.0,"This can happen. It can also be a whole lot worse for no obvious reason.

I went through a part of my life where my social anxiety was soooo intense it morphed into paranoid hallucinations and delusions. Let me also clarify, I do not have a psychotic disorder but I might be bipolar. My symptoms are typically anxiety and depression with fits of rage.

There could be an underlying cause but if you're like me, the underlying cause might never be known or could be related to genetics and there's not always going to be an obvious way to deal with it.

If you get to the point where you feel like you cannot function effectively in your life to do the things you want and know you can do (I used to get catatonically depressed and be unable to talk or move for a day or two at a time), then please go see a professional. Try their advice and take meds if you need to. Pills can't magically cure you but sometimes if you find the right one's, they can take the edge off.

Try your best not to self medicate with alcohol or even weed. Sometimes weed can help but as a society (U.S. citizen here) we are still learning about HOW exactly to use weed to get the most benefit and least side effects.

Best of luck. I also highly recommend scheduling days JUST to sit around doing nothing except relaxing as fuck shit like get a massage, watch a comedy movie, smoke a joint, or even just sleep ALL day without worry about being unproductive. Sometimes you need to just be lazy when you have anxiety but feeling useless can make it worse so you need to plan for it."
TrueOffMyChest,f8we7zq,t1_f8wdnqv,1574888816.0,"Also if you live in the US and you're not an oppressed minority, just do what you can to remember what you're thankful for. Don't let the news fuck your head too much.

On the other hand, if you ARE an oppressed minority and hence directly affected by this asshole-in-office's stupidity, just know that people on the other side are fighting for you and not all of us are ignorant fucking hateful fucktards.

Priority of worries (stolen from Jordan Peterson): Worry about your own health and wellbeing, then your family's, then your community's. Then worry about your wellbeing going 3 months into the future, behave in a way that benefits your family 3 months into the future, then your community going into the future.

You aren't perfect, you'll fuck it up here and there, but just do your best. Change starts inside us. Be the change you want to see (I think that's Gandhi or the Dali Lama.... not sure, but who cares, it's meaning rings true)."
TrueOffMyChest,f8wda0b,t3_e2mio1,1574888210.0,"Let me tell you something.... I'm 32, OK?

I've been a Democrat, a Republican, an Anarchist, a Socialist, and a mother fucking Libertarian. I've run the gamut of politcal affiliation, and I""m not just talking about my official voter's registration (citizen of the U.S. btw).

I used to go to protests with the revolutionary communist party. I was part of the Black Bloc before it was fucked up by ""Antifa"" (a label that had also changed over time to become more negative).

I studied economics because I thought I'd figure something out, find some answers. Wrong. Just more disagreement and infinite amounts of different perspectives. I lived as a homeless anarchist in LA because I thought there was something romantic about that lifestyle.

Here's what I've come to learn..... NO ONE KNOWS A GODDAMN THING about what is right and wrong. EVERYONE is just trying to do what they think is best. Obviously hateful ideologies are counterproductive, let's not get into that type of shit though.

Bottom line is political affiliation is like religion. It doesn't matter. But it doesn't have to be destructive either. Don't get caught up rooting for a political party like it's a fucking sports team. Realize that if you make a particular belief or political idea part of your identity, it predisposes you to feel offended or defensive when someone disagrees.

Be thoughtful of what your beliefs are. NEVER blindly follow ANYONE. But also realize we all know next to nothing and even the people who have dedicated their whole lives to figuring it out are all still in disagreement, so the ONLY important takeaway here is that you need to do your best to get along with everyone.

Your beliefs will keep changing. Who cares in what direction that is? Again, live and let live. Fuck politics, find a philosophy. Love each other. Figure out what you really care about and hope to god politicians will get a clue at some point but don't ever get your hopes up for ANY particular candidate.

I'm not religious, but I pray this whole Trump thing is bigger than we realize, like a lesson from God if there is one to not be apathetic, but to also not fight each other as much as we are. The answer is love, and it's not easy, I fucking suck at it, but we have to fucking try."

That's why I try to only reply to posts when I'm up and only make posts when I'm down (don't try to look for them I use multiple accounts and delete old posts and so should you guys for the sake of not being discriminated against for your problems, which are normal and sometimes feel extreme and can make the general public react to you irrationally because they don't understand).

Love you guys so much, I wish everyone as much happiness as possible, especially coming up on the holidays."

It's OK if you feel sad, depressed, hopeless, angry, hateful, etc. Allow yourself to experience your emotions and then do what you can to process them. I'm so sorry you're going through this but you can deal with this and be OK. You can still have a life, and a fulfilling one at that! It might take time to feel like you do, but you can do this.

Best of luck!"
