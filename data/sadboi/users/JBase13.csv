I'm not sure how open you are but have you considered psychadelics or shrooms? They have turned my life around, just a suggestion to try ♥️ I hope you start to feel some peace soon"

careeradvice,f7a4n4v,t1_f79ka87,1573520256.0,Thanks for your input!! Means a lot.. are you still doing graphic design? I am thinking of going back to school online or obtaining a certification.. while I work a stable job of course. I know itll be a lot of work but it will pay off.. emotionally and financially in the end :)

careeradvice,f79fe8s,t3_dshfo8,1573506768.0,"I had a girl that did this to me as well. I'm sorry you're in this situation.. Unfortunately I ended up blowing up with valid reasons. She couldn't take 2 minutes to show me something and nastily said, ""ugh I'll just do it myself then!!"". I was stern with her and stated that I do not appreciate the constant negative energy and putting me down for not knowing something. I told her she came across as frustrated with me for trying to have her teach me something and if she would take some time to show me, I would understand and would be of more help. 

I think people like that are just miserable people and are like that even outside of work, because they are unhappy with themselves and their life. If it truly bothers you to where it makes you uncomfortable try being stern with this person and explain how disrespectful it is. Follow up with management if you have to but I think it might help to say something. :)"

Psychic,f71vc1u,t3_du1mf6,1573348939.0,"I hope you find a caring and emphatic therapist that will help you and guide you through dealing with the loss of friendships. That's not to say those friendships are lost forever. I would recommend focusing as much as you can on yourself and what makes ~you~ happy. What are you favorite hobbies, goals, dreams? Work towards that and you may start to feel a little better. 

Once you start to feel happier about yourself and the cool things you have been doing on your own, who knows, you might run into someone that's been in the same shoes and you've find a friend. 

Stay true to yourself and keep hold of that light, itll all come back to you!"

relationships,f71swo5,t1_f71s5el,1573347426.0,"Sorry guys new to this still trying to learn out the kinks.. I posted somewhere else in this thread but here's the jist: 

I didn't say he could or could not call me a bitch but has hurt my feelings. I also believe it's not fair to call him an ass or jerk but rather express it in a healthy way together such as ""you frustrated me by doing this"".. rather than any sort of name calling. I think you just have to communicate and figure out healthier methods to express your frustration. I would never to him it's not okay to call me a bitch and turn around and call him names. :)"
relationships,f71rzd0,t3_du3r2q,1573346815.0,"I think it comes down to what works for you and your relationship. If you feel hurt or disrespected by any sort of name I think it's best to work out ways to communicate better in the heat of the moment. 

I'm not here for arguments, just for inputting what has helped our relationship to see if that has helped others. My main point is no matter what derogitive term is used its not always the right thing to do but realistically does happen. Just have to find a healthy way of expressing your frustration other than name calling :)"
relationships,f71n8hw,t3_du3r2q,1573344105.0,"Anytime my boyfriend has called me a ""bitch"" it has hurt my feelings. It has happened maybe twice in our 7 years of being together.  
He has always been remorseful and once we calm down and talk, I ask and he explains why he has called me one. 

Introspectively, I do know I was being a bitch. I still don't think it's always right to say, however, if he is being an ass or a jerk, I have called him out as well."
