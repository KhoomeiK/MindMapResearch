Accounting,esw7usc,t1_esvvu6o,1562310518.0,"I think everyone wishes they made substantially more money. I'd rather make 70k than 50k, 100k than 70k, and 500k than 100k."
Accounting,esw7mno,t1_esvvu6o,1562310414.0,"COL is average where I live. You don't have to have a high income to live well here. If you're so concerned about money, why do you live in a place where you have to pay so much to live? Move to a place where rent is cheaper. More money for your kid's college and your family's chronic illnesses, neither of which you'll be able to afford on your accountant salary anyway. This shit is starting to get confusing."
Accounting,esw79wv,t1_esw5zlq,1562310262.0,"Also, you're an accountant, bro. What weekends? Lol."
Accounting,esw5zlq,t1_esvwc2h,1562309714.0,"The funniest part about your stance is that with healthcare costs where they are now, an accountant's salary is not enough to pay for the costs. Not even close. You act as if accountants make huge money compared to clinicians. They really don't. Major surgeries and treatments often reach 6 figures a piece. What if they need 3 rounds of a 100k treatment? Is your 70k/yr (average accountant salary) going to pay for that? You couldn't even afford it by draining your 401k. You say you can afford the ""best"" treatments. Not a fucking chance. You can afford average at best, and that's if you take out a second mortgage on your house. And college. How you going to pay for your kid's out of state Master's level education on your accountant salary? Do you have any idea what tuition costs right now, especially at prestigious universities? Doctorate Psychologists actually make more than you on average. Average pay for a LCSW is only slightly below average accountant pay, maybe 10 grand less. In terms of healthcare and education, at this point everyone in the country is f***ed, whether they're an accountant or a therapist. 

Engineers make about 20k more per year on average than accountants. Why didn't you do engineering, if you're all about the money? Lawyers make 50k more than accountants. Why not law? Hell, why aren't you a doctor?

Here's some context for you: My grandmother has COPD, CHF, and is recovering from a stroke. She takes about 7 medications, sees the doctor frequently, is routinely hospitalized, and requires 24/7 care at a facility. Costs for said care are astronomical. If not for Medicare and Medicaid, we'd go bankrupt paying for it, and that's with my parent's well over 100k combined income. I don't think your accountant's salary is going to go as far as you think it will. If someone gets sick, say bye bye to your 401k."

What is their life satisfaction?"
Accounting,esvo7lv,t1_esve4v8,1562301790.0,"Life is what you make it out to be. The meaning of life that you find is a personal choice. If you make life a ""big predator,"" that's what it is. I don't live in that world. Such a worldview doesn't guide my choices."
Accounting,estb5t5,t1_essdp0f,1562264720.0,"There are a lot of reasons. The biggest is the notion that the aim is to help a client solve their own problems, come up with their own solutions, and learn self-empowerment. So, for example, rather than giving direct advice when a client presents with a dilemma, we'd apply a solution focus and ask ""What are your options? What do you think you can do? What have you tried in the past that has and hasn't worked?"" This helps the client brainstorm and think through their own issues. Another reason is that if they take your advice, try it, and fail, you become the bad guy. Therapeutic techniques are highly individualized. Different approaches and skills work for different people. Direct advice giving disrespects that process. The idea is to get the client to find their own way, empowering them to no longer need you and think and act effectively on their own. A counselor's goal is to work themselves out of a job."
Accounting,esrlniy,t1_esqx5h8,1562228878.0,"Thank you! I do want to reiterate that accounting is a meaningful career. Not hating on it. Just for me specifically, being in the mental health/addictions field is more so. It's different for everybody."
Accounting,esrl514,t1_esqtjt4,1562228441.0,"No problem, and thanks for dropping by the thread! If you're in accounting, there are many opportunities to serve your community in the field, as has been mentioned in the thread. Working directly for a non-profit, or for a PA firm that specializes in non-profit/charities. That was a consideration for me, but I'm more of a front-lines kinda guy. Also, hospitals, churches, charities, non-profits, and public health agencies are ALWAYS in need of volunteers, so if you want to jump in, that's a good place to start. Volunteer work is great. There is so much variety. If public service is something you're interested in, you can feel out the various services and dial in where you want to put your energy."
Accounting,esrkohy,t1_esr0mln,1562228069.0,"Definitely. There are so many people struggling with mental health and addictions who have so much potential. Many of them could be stellar accountants like you fine folks, given the right support. I've seen many success stories. I'm one of them. Not to toot my own horn :D"
Accounting,esqosmk,t1_esqhvku,1562206777.0,"Oh believe me, I know that now, after having done my research and hanging around these forums (I actually like reading accountant's posts).

My expectations were a little.... up my ass. I wanted that analyst career without the analyst career. Considered finance, but really, managing investments for wealthy people is more pressure and stress than I care to take on. Half of Wall Street's analysts and traders can't outperform a monkey with darts. Fuck that."
Accounting,esqh5lt,t1_esqg31p,1562202397.0,"That's awesome! Yea, non-profit accounting sounds great. When I was studying accounting, my motivations were $$$, so I didn't give much thought to applying those skills to public service."
Accounting,esqgxny,t1_esq9h4a,1562202273.0,"Yea, I think an MS is the way to go."
Accounting,esqgus9,t1_esq96hz,1562202227.0,"Oh, of course not. Me personally, I actually really like accounting. My sophomore accounting classes were awesome. Very mentally stimulating, challenging, interesting, and often times even fun. I would have liked to have been an accountant. The public accounting tax season hours are iffy for me, as my mental health challenges make stress tolerance more difficult, but maybe I'd have done well in private.

My point is, accounting was A passion. Human services is THE passion. Also, as stated, my expectations and motivations for accounting were, shall we say, off. Lol."
