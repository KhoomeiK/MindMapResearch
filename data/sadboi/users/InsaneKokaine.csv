NarcissisticAbuse,ewho59j,t3_cnw9o3,1565414857.0,"I did. After 10 years of marriage and 2 beautiful boys, I went completely NC. Me and my kids left at 3am 2 years ago with just 1 suitcase. I changed my number, email, place of employment, my kids' school, everything. From what I hear, he tells people he left me and I'm a slut and I don't let him see our kids. I was communicating through my mother to him regarding our kids and he said he didnt want to see them. It was VERY hard at first. I felt like I was withdrawing from drugs. But now, my life has never been better!!! He goes around lying and playing the victim but I don't even care to defend myself. He has zero power over me and he was angry initially. Took him a good 6 months to accept that he couldn't reach me. WORTH IT!"
ptsd,ewhj790,t3_co88l8,1565409793.0,I'm pretty honest. Mine's from 10 years of severe domestic violence. I just tell them an abusive marriage. I appreciate people that ask questions instead of getting freaked out.
ptsd,ew8lcu8,t3_cn1cr1,1565211369.0,"The hardest thing for me to come to terms with was that person, before PTSD, was gone forever. My life is now “before PTSD” and “after PTSD” when I recall events or reminisce (which is very rare). I’m 3 years post diagnosis. I’m still trying to figure out who I am now. It makes me really sad when I think about everything PTSD has stolen from me. Chunks of time are just gone. I hate when a convo starts “Hey! Remember when....?!?!” Nope. Probably not."
holdmyfeedingtube,ew5mtj2,t1_ew5gdvv,1565140068.0,I’m so confused. Where’s the rule to censor that? I can’t find it. Help!
