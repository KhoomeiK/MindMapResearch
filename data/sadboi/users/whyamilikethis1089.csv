I feel really bad for coworker, losing her baby, finding out her fiance lied to her, her fiance having a child with his ex and finding out she probably won't be able to have kids has got to be horrible, she's still ta for trying to use op's baby to deal with this.

Some of it to try and understand this light-year ahead thinking might be advise if you want people who have never seen this or heard of this before. If you know that how your mom handled it was very different than how most others would, we can't really be expected to understand how exactly this would work with only the theory and no supporting actions or examples of what this would look like.

>For example you have a son, he's a great kid at home but you find out he's been a bully.

This example doesn't work for me. If my son was a wonderful kids on the surface but was hurting my other children would be more appropriate. Funnily enough with having kids this happens a lot. 

You still love your children but acknowledge and work on their flaws, but they are children and you are teaching them. This situation is grown adults. So even better is you know your parents is cruel to your sibling, they are a great parent to you though. In that situation you could still see that treating someone like that is reprehensible and they aren't necessarily a good person. 

You can still love a bad person, but usually from a distance is best because most you never know when you could become the object of abuse and you do wonder if that person actually can love and if they do love you. Now compound that with a lie that distanced you from the person they are treating wrongly and you it changed your view of the victim. 

So now you wonder if that person can love you and what else they might be lying about. This is a very deep cutting betrayal. Say your dad isn't a good dad, but he hides that from your mom so she can't do anything about it and doesn't know it's affecting you, after over a decade she finds out, do you think that would've changed how she handled the situation?

>However I will re-iterate what I meant by that. Essentially at each point when you take an action there will be a reaction, and different actions will lead to different branches of reality manifesting.

I hold to my argument. Dad pulled the pin, it just didn't detonate until the truth came out. Dad took the action that caused this and then he lied about that doubling the damage caused. Op had every right to her feelings and I think acted very well considering. She needs space to heal and I hope she slowly works back to a relationship with her father, but knowing he did that to her mom and her will change that relationship forever because her view of him changed. I would guess she still loves him, that's why it hurts so very bad.

>And I'm not saying he deserves any better,

Is that not kind of your argument? That she should keep her relationship with her dad because he was good to get so he shouldn't be treated like this? I may have read wrong but that's what I thought.

So your mom watched her child suffer from having a bad dad because he was a good husband? How far do you let that go? Being a good parent is a part of parents relationships, that's why co-parenting after a bad divorce is hard, you still have to have a civil relationship to help with the child's relationship with the parents.

>while you Dad has most definitely treated your mum grotesquely, this was not aimed at you

So even if family treats other members of the family grotesquely you don't need to worry or let it effect your relationship because it's only between them? You aren't supposed to have feelings about how some one you love is being treated? Just because it's someone else you love?? I disagree wholeheartedly.

Making delivery drivers follow company rules means no more delivery drivers? Sounds like a company issue not a customer one.

Companies going under because delivery drivers are unreliable and breaking rules and treating customers bad so that no customer wants to order from that business any more.

Following the rules and using the service is exactly what we're all supposed to be doing. Op is helping a neighbor out who needs that job at the pastry shop, and the driver and following the rules. The driver is the one risking it all by trying to get people to break the rules and not follow how the system works.

Hey boss who demanded that her weight lifting restrictions not be followed. You keep piece mealing the information to for your narrative. Pregnant women can't lift usually over about 25 lbs. It's usually one of the only restrictions placed on healthy pregnant women and boss ignored it. The boss ignored health restrictions on op. You don't have to be pregnant for this restriction either, there are a multitude of different reasons for lifting restrictions. And it's temporary.


>My point is plenty of pregnant women don't force themselves to apply for jobs involving maintenance at water filtration plants and there's little reason (not completely none, but little) why OP has to make herself do it and then end up with all the drama in her post history.

I haven't looked at her post history because it doesn't concern this situation. She can be ta in many other situations but she's asking about a specific one. Any pregnant woman would ""force themselves"" to take a good paying job they are qualified for and that can easily accommodate her pregnancy for financial security. I'd love it if they didn't have to though. And are you suggesting she should take a lower paying job because you think this one is too hard for her? That op needs to take your opinion and work within your parameters to make you happy is ridiculous. She couldn't lift a heavy object, that's it, that's the only example she gives of not being able to do her job and there was a person standing right by her who could do it so it shouldn't have been an issue.

A town could live or die if the factory moved so no one would help to change these tactics. I got fired from a restaurant job 2 months after announcing my pregnancy, was told I could train my replacement or leave. I was the breadwinner at the time, it was devastating and I was uneducated on what rights I had but they would have used a different excuse any way.
