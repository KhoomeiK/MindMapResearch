AskWomen,fobvzjs,t3_g6hkcx,1587664279.0,That I didn’t drive across the country to escape my crazy family the day I turned 18. Instead I was 6 months pregnant and needed my crazy family. I now have a junior in high school that I’m so very proud of and three other munchkins that make my life beautiful. My family is still crazy though but we’re not all under the same roof so it’s gravy. Haha
AskWomen,fnmxniz,t1_fnmepu8,1587080172.0,"I love this.... I am a 34AA.....always have been. 4 Children later and I feel more confident in myself now than I ever did before children. I stopped dying my hair, getting my nails done and wearing a ton of makeup a couple years ago. I threw out my push-up bras and now wear wire free natural form bras. I don’t worry so much about the changes due to aging the way I did when I was younger. Something about being a warrior of a mother who spends her days multitasking to the max and smashing goals made me realize what a waste of time it is trying to “look” like the perfect mother/wife when I knew all along I was the best mother/wife I could possibly be. I put my all into my family. 
I’ve fantasized about breast implants my entire life. Even secured financing and then chickened out at 20 years old. Something deep within me told me I’d regret it. I again tossed the idea around after my third child and had convinced myself that I deserved a boob job after we  had our fourth. Our fourth is one now and the idea of getting a boob job is the farthest thing from my mind. I feel like superwomen in this body. I’ve done some real badass things with this body. I need to respect and honor what I’ve put it through. My husband is thrilled to see me embrace my natural look and has always told me he prefers me this way. It wouldn’t matter at this point what he prefers but I can say it feels good to know he’s in my corner. I am constantly reminding my daughters where true beauty lies; compassion and kindness towards others as well as yourself. Honesty and integrity are so important. You only get back in life what you put out.   As I teach these little humans I realize that in turn they are teaching me these things as well. It’s all such a blessing"

A lot of all this is not in your hands and is out of your control. Remember that before you beat yourself up.

AskMen,flv0esw,t3_fr8uwy,1585513790.0,"So, my ex went through this. I’m the women in the relationship. He entered the picture when my son was 8 months old and we separated when my son was 8 years old. 
We still to this day have communication and when there are holidays and school breaks we always make sure that some of that time is spent with my ex and his family. It would be selfish of me to request and enforce any other way. 
My son bonded with him and although his father is still in the picture, he still supports the time with my ex. We’re actually all pretty good friends. 
Y’all need to put your selfishness aside and focus on the child. Broken families encompass our society, there really is no “norm”  We need to embrace that and leave our egos behind"

As you stated regarding 2012-2013, it was in fact an incredibly difficult time in my life full of destruction and then rebuilding and finding peace into 2014.
2014 through most of 2018 was the happiest and most serene time in my life. The end of 2018 to now has been a test to my sanity and has been impossible for me to understand because it feels completely out of my control. I have been feeling lighter as of lately.

personalfinance,fl77zqb,t3_fn16u1,1584896224.0,"This happened to me last year. I still don’t trust any financial institute with my money. I am lucky that I can handle my finances through my husbands accounts. Recently they went after our savings account which was still a joint account because after our incident last year we sat down with the manager of our bank and he assured us the levy would not be able to take from a savings account, only checking. It took them a year but they got our savings. I bought a fucking safe. Now this is all after I went to court 5 years ago to settle my debts. It was agreed on that they would take a certain dollar amount from my paycheck weekly. 4 years later they levy my checking account after making consistent payments, less the lapsing weeks during job changes where I had to report to them my new employer and could proceed in continuing to take payments from my paychecks. 
I’m sorry you are dealing with this and I hope come Monday you can have some questions answered. You most likely have a long road ahead of you in dealing with this on top of the current national pandemic. I’m so sorry you are going through this and wish I could give you more advice outside of buying a safe. Crazy, I know....but that’s the situation. I have bills to pay like the rest of us."

AskMen,fkr2rox,t3_fk3cz3,1584460710.0,"I know this is an ask/men so I hope my story will be okay as a women’s experience. I got picked up for a date and driven about 35 minutes away to one of his favorite bars. We order a couple martinis and within minutes of arriving he starts chatting up two other women at the bar. He continued with his back to me showing them pictures of his custom built home with a bar in his living room. I continue to drink my drink and give it about 10-15 more minutes of this while exchanging glances with the female bartender, both of us silently agreeing that this guy is acting like a total ass. I excuse myself to the restroom and while I’m in there the bartender meets me in there and asks if I need help getting out of my date. God bless her soul! She had already spoken to a coworker who was about to clock out and leave to see if she could give me a ride home. The bartender then snuck me into the kitchen to chat with the other girl who was leaving and we planned my escape. I threw her ten bucks for gas and it was a go. I received text messages later that night telling me to eat shit and die (poop emoji included) I laughed it off and moved on with my life, some people...
To be noted, I had known this man for over a decade. He had been pursuing me since the day we met, but I was always in a relationship. I was giving him a chance after getting out of a long term relationship. I also worked for him on and off over those years and had an instance I’ll never forget. We had custom made “uniforms” with our names inscribed. One day, years after I had stopped working for him, I decide to stop in at his place to surprise him because I was in the area. When I walked in he had my old uniform displayed in his living room and had essentially bedazzled it and had it in the center of a large collection of other uniforms that were currently being used on a regular basis by his current employees. I saw it and laughed. I asked him why my uniform was still there and why the hell he chose to bedazzle it. His reply was pretty simple exclaiming” well, you’re the best and I want my girls to model themselves after you, and you know I’m just waiting for you to come back”"

It is no longer affecting me at work which is great. More so in private conversation. The sleeping has become a bit of a problem so I started taking 10mg CBD from a licensed dispensary and it has helped a lot. I feel my body has adjusted pretty well. I tried coming off the meds last week because I was feeling so great and thought I could take it from here. I was wrong, the the third day I had a massive panic attack that had me on my hands and knees trying not to lose consciousness. Soo, I started taking it again the next day and am going to continue to take it for the remainder of the year and then reassess my needs. 
Something to note is before I started this medication I was having at least two bad panic attacks a day, usually in the morning and at night in bed. I also was suffering from frightening intrusive thoughts of violence that I could not control. It was a very scary time for me. I have not experienced any of those symptoms since starting the medication."

In regards to the social anxiety, if socializing with your coworkers makes you uncomfortable try just staying busy with side work, stocking supplies or check in with other servers if they need a hand with something.  It takes time to get to know your coworkers and feel comfortable around them. Just take it slow. I’ve learned over the years that there will always be a couple bad eggs amongst your coworkers.

AskWomen,fhavh5p,t3_f26rsg,1581428166.0,Evil runs rampant. People aren’t inherently “good” as I always thought as a child.
Serverlife,fh8l4p0,t1_fh451ts,1581362048.0,Very true. Avoid corporate like the plague
Serverlife,fh8jiy2,t3_f14y0t,1581361070.0,"I’ve worked in restaurants for 18 years. 13 of those years serving. Once you’re in it’s hard to quit. Although I have days that I want more than anything to quit. But the truth remains I can work 25-30 hours a week and bank. I can be home with my little ones during the day which means none of my children have ever been in a daycare which is wonderful. I’ve always been afraid of the idea of dropping my kids off with a relevant strangers for 8 hours a day, five days a week. No thank you.  I’m a foodie too so that helps. The people I work with are fun and keep me young spirited. Some nights are rough but the payout is always worth it. I’ve been offered management positions a few times but have always passed them up. No I don’t want to work twice as many hours and make less money! I average $35 an hour which is pretty typical. Managers don’t pull that.  I’ve rationalized with myself over the years that my title in the work force doesn’t matter. If you’re happy, have a roof over your head and food on the table not much else matters. America likes to live in excess. I’m not one of those Americans. I don’t want to work my life away either. I have good balance. Good luck to you! I wish you the best!"

bupropion,fh0x177,t1_fgsl0ud,1581208401.0,I’m on week five and the foggy brain is getting really annoying. I forget simple things all the time and find myself spacing out and losing touch with my reality for a few seconds. Really creeps me out. This morning when I woke up from some crazy lucid dreams I couldn’t figure out the difference between some of my dreams vs actual occurrences. If it doesn’t improve in the next couple weeks I’m going to ween off.
AstralProjection,fgv3s14,t3_f0kc5g,1581136306.0,"I’ve only learned of astral projection over the course of a few days and every corner I turn, there’s something I learn or hear about that sounds simply amazing and mind bending. I can’t offer any feedback or advice but, thank you for taking this journey in your life and sharing with others. Means a lot"
mdmatherapy,fgqqq2x,t3_ezzy9f,1581029477.0,I’m wondering all the same things. I’ll be following this thread
egodeath,fgpozj7,t3_ey1mb7,1581009179.0,"I had never even heard of ego death before it happened to me. I lost all sense of reality. I no longer had a physical body. Nothing existed around me. I became terrified as I slipped deeper into my trip that I would lose all sense of consciousness and self and either hurt myself or hurt someone else like that guy in Florida on bath salts (remember that shit?) crazy, anyway. I was with my husband the entire time and ended up surrendering to my trip and harmonizing with the only sound in our room which was the air conditioner and saying “love” over and over again for hours. 
For weeks after the event I was afraid to be alone and still get scared thinking of it now over a year later. I think if I had heard about ego death prior I wouldn’t have become so scared. I probably won’t ever take a hallucinogen again."
creepypasta,fgpilfd,t3_ezl8pd,1581005520.0,I’ve never heard of anything like this....have you tried researching the house or past owners? I think Zillow can tell you the history on when it’s been sold in the past few years. I’d start there and maybe check out your local library to see if they have any records or the town hall.  I’m so sorry you are experiencing this. Please keep us updated. Does it happen every night?
Parenting,fgpcb2t,t3_ezt0zg,1581001875.0,"I’m in the exact same boat. I’m on child number 4 and have never let my 3 prior children cry it out but for the sake of my sanity I’ve had to a couple times with my 4th. I’m at my wits end and if I don’t get some sleep I will just straight up lose it. I feel for you. You’re not a bad mom you’re a real mom. Yeah, and it doesn’t get easier, you’ll always be faced with a new challenge around every corner. But, I try and focus on the positive aspects of being a parent and try and just be grateful my children are happy and healthy. We all do our best to lay a solid foundation for our children and one day when they have their own children they will have a new found respect and admiration for you and you will see that all those sleepless nights paid off.  Hang in there momma and remember to make time for yourself. Find a good babysitter and utilize them! I’ve literally had a sitter just so I could lock myself in my bedroom and be left alone for the afternoon. You have to make self care a priority to stay sane. Good luck friend"
tifu,fgno1r8,t3_ezd26e,1580949094.0,"So for real, it takes a lot of bravery to even acknowledge your fetish’s to yourself, and to have those broadcasted is a serious tamper on your path to self discovery. I applaud you for getting to a point where you can recognize what gets you off and I also feel for you in your embarrassment having those very private feelings becoming public knowledge.  I’m sorry your inner most feelings and thoughts were inadvertently exposed to your peers and hope that you can take this as an opportunity to embrace YOU and not give a flying fuck what others may think of it. You’ve already climbed mountains figuring out what makes you tick. If they have a problem with it they can go fuck themselves. Also, it’s worth noting....ever think about what your peers fetishes could be all about? You’re not alone here we all have our fetishes. But some of us aren’t able to accept them. But, hey! You did!"
