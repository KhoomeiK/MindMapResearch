bipolar,f6hs6gu,t3_drf5jz,1572863837.0,"Seroquel dreams get me. I get one of three things when I take it. Sleep paralysis, super vivid dreams that I start acting out in real life (which scares my wife), or the best nights sleep imaginable."

bipolar,f602zno,t3_dq0qv4,1572602728.0,I just started on Seroquel two weeks ago. Can you believe my dumbass said I‚Äôll try it just to see how it effects me and then not take it regularly...now I‚Äôm taking it twice a day. It‚Äôs what I look forward to every night.
bipolar,f4vkihz,t3_dlqjyx,1571843868.0,I‚Äôve recently had an urge to start painting with acrylics and a palette knife but I have no idea where to start. This kind of textured art is exactly what I want to do.

bipolar,f2malrb,t3_ddowcb,1570303588.0,Preach!
bipolar,f2m8kqu,t1_f2jelxi,1570303020.0,Thank you so much. This is basically what I was looking for. I‚Äôm a 30 year old dude and I was just put on Zoloft after a three day hospitalization. My psychiatrist is on vacation at the moment and I was started on them without any mood stabilizers and I feel like it‚Äôs just a big f‚Äîk you from the other psychiatrists who doubt me having bipolar. (I‚Äôm in the military so they try to avoid officially diagnosing unless they absolutely have to because you basically get kicked out for it.) I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôm going to go off the rails hypomanic and spend every dime I have. I‚Äôm already pretty bad normally but I hear the SSRIs can amp it up.
bipolar,f2hyom0,t1_f2gi661,1570249946.0,"Quick question, how long did it take for him to start going manic after he started taking anti-depressants?"
bipolar,f2hwcze,t1_f2heijt,1570249101.0,"Wow, we‚Äôre you already hypomanic/manic? Or were you just suddenly jolted into it?"
bipolar_irl,f2e06g5,t3_dd0z2u,1570173010.0,This just made me smile :)
bipolar,f2e04m3,t1_f2dvrtq,1570172932.0,Oops I should have been more specific. I had meant to say for people that weren‚Äôt on mood stabilizers. My normal psychiatrist is on vacation and I was admitted to a psyc ward for 3 days. They started me on Sertraline and I‚Äôm really worried my next hypomanic episode is going to be really intense. (They also gave me Hydroxyzine)

bipolar,f29jojo,t1_f29i5ev,1570099320.0,Yeah I already had to do this before I was discharged from the hospital yesterday.
bipolar,f29hd3i,t1_f29f9xr,1570097635.0,These two medications are all I‚Äôm on right now. I‚Äôm on a downhill at the moment but I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôm going to start going up and not be able to stop it.
bipolar,f29evyw,t3_dcmmaa,1570094830.0,I know what you mean man. My insides are playing the movie at 2x speed and my outsides are just feeling gross about it. So I pace and I look around all over the place and I can‚Äôt sit but I can‚Äôt be productive.
bipolar,f29en8g,t3_dcoer5,1570094523.0,I honestly feel like they‚Äôre just trying a pretty weighty experiment because they‚Äôre tired of messing around.

bipolar_irl,f1svg6t,t3_daoqw1,1569734678.0,This is literally me right now. I‚Äôve been on the couch since 0500 this morning so my wife can sleep peacefully because I feel like I‚Äôm vibrating.
bipolar,f1qcks0,t3_dafp7t,1569698057.0,"It‚Äôs not just to spend money. It‚Äôs because of the possibilities of what the thing can bring. I‚Äôve had maybe 15 different hobbies/interests over the past 4 years. It‚Äôs always more about the thoughts than the spending or the thing. I‚Äôm just a dreamer.

bipolar,f1b558a,t3_d8kcnz,1569324086.0,"I know exactly what you mean. I get so over the top about everything for such a small period of time it absolutely drives my wife crazy. It ruins conversation constantly because I can‚Äôt stop making the spreadsheet in my head for what car I need based off power, size, fun-factor, long term reliability, appearance, drive train, what tires I‚Äôll need for the different seasons in the different locations we could possibly move to, what octane fuel ratings they have to make sure I can tune the car to what I believe are appropriate horsepower/torque for the car...which I‚Äôll totally not care about in a month. Conversely I get super irritated with my wife for liking ‚Äúbasic‚Äù shit like Starbucks or Pinterest things. But I know 100% that she just likes what she likes not because it‚Äôs trendy or popular. I hate being an asshole to my perfect bride all the damn time. She has got to be one of the most forgiving people in the world."
