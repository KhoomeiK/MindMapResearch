But there is definitely a trauma/poverty cycle that stretches way back in my family. And while the past doesn’t excuse poor decisions, it all somehow makes more sense.

It breaks my heart that since she died when I was young and before I knew about this that I never got the chance to lift her up specifically as a victim of this type of thing (especially after experiencing my own but perhaps less severe assaults)—to say, it’s okay, you made it through and we’re okay."

AskReddit,fa01ddm,t3_e7d1e0,1575747667.0,"My mom died when I was 13 from a drug overdose. This was in 2003z. Our life together was pretty tumultuous and there was a string of boyfriends that were varying degrees of abusive. 

I remember her seeming to reference some sort of sexual trauma once, but she didn’t give much detail (probably due to my age).

My grandma recently said, “It’s like what happened to your mother” when we were talking about something. I asked her what she meant. She said  “You don’t know?”

She then goes on to tell me that one of her husbands (who was a police chief) “did something” to my mom when she was 11. I wasn’t getting the full sorry so I tried to research public records (my grandma mentioned a trial).

I found an appellate brief where this man was appealing his sentence. The brief had many references and excerpts from the original trial. Here is what I learned:

My mom was ten. Something happened that caused her to run to a neighbors and call my grandma who was at work. Her testimony was that she was taking a nap in his bed and she woke up during penetration. He was found guilty of “molestation” (???). I couldn’t fully grasp why he was appealing, but some of the brief described my grandma as giving testimony for the state, but she actually somewhat defended her then husband. 

Also, in his defense, he tried to reference my mom’s “previous sexual experiences” to basically say she knew what she was doing and he didn’t rape her. His appeal was denied. He has since died. 

The weird thing is, when you look at the typical trajectory of people who have these types of trauma, some of it makes some sense. She had this abuse, she had to go to trial, the whole thing with my grandma apparently defending him....she ended up with a drug problem, 4 kids before she was 20, and poor relationships with men. This was fairly recent so I’m still processing it."

Came here to say, SAME. I was with a group of 3 other people (two couples). We drove 16 hrs to CO, the impetus being the show (and Red Rocks a bucket list item). 

My squad was dancing around like crazy like we always do, but quite honestly, I tell people this is the worst DD concert I’ve been to (even though the whole experience was amazing). No one else was moving much. 

The crowd didn’t have the vibe and it lacked intimacy compared to the smaller venues we’ve seen DD at. 

We made a week of it and Colorado was so amazing, but just recently, my friend and I were like, “We’ve gotta catch a winter tour date, when was the last time we even saw DD? Last March in Covington?” After a minute we were like, duhhhhh, Red Rocks! It’s the last thing I think of from our trip."

My buddy learned it on the guitar and he and his wife taught us all the words, before I ever heard a recorded DD song.

Since then, I’ve seen them maybe 12 times since 2017 (including Red Rocks!). 

First time we saw them, we got Scott’s attention and said, “FOREST FIRE?? I WEAR MY OWN _NEW ZEALAND_???” Scott said, “MY OWN _MUSEUM_,” which makes sense and is a line that is repeated elsewhere. 

I would love to hear this song live. 

Cheers and see some of you in Nashville in February!

Not stoplight related but a few months ago, I was on the interstate and traffic stopped suddenly...for everyone but the driver who was doing 80 and lost control of his car. I had come to a stop but left a decent amount of space between me and the semi in front of me.

When I saw the Jeep careening out of control, I whipped onto the shoulder, next to the semi trailer, thinking if dude was going to hit something, better the semi trailer than my compact car. This gout was fishtailing across 4 lanes trying to miss all the stopped cars. It was terrifying and almost gave me a panic attack. 

If I had used the stopped traffic as a good time to whip out my phone, it could have been a bad time. 

In an argument that boils down to 1. Should you pay attention, even when stopped or 2. Should you pull out your phone because you can’t possibly get hurt or you have no recourse anyone, #1 is the clear and definitive winner."

It is so saddening to see so many people together who aren’t compatible and don’t seem to figure that out until after kids and marriage. Because divorce and the dissolution of a family can take such a toll on the couple and kids (if they are involved).
