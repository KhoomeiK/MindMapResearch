Ingrown_Toenails,fqwbwql,t3_gla9ai,1589699028.0,Have you talked to your doctor about killing the nail cells in that area so the ingrown wont grow back? You'll have your normal toenail ofc but the ingrowns shouldn't grow back
Epilepsy,fqw1chk,t1_fqsvge5,1589690168.0,"With insurance my meds cost about $30+ totally for 3 months of lamictal, topamax and one month ativan. Without insurance it would be about $200+ but good rx has good discounts. Sometimes you have to have your doc prescribe them in a certain way for it to be cheaper. Yikes yes MRIs are expensive without insurance. That's nice that they're offering to pay but yikes its expensive."
Epilepsy,fqw13p1,t1_fqsqk55,1589689986.0,Same! It took about a week without lamictal for me to start seizing. Maybe because I had so much lamictal in my system already. Lamictal changed my life! I dont know where I would be without it.
Epilepsy,fqru33j,t3_gkl578,1589591916.0,F 22. . I went without my meds for a week and a half because I couldn't afford them. It was horrific. Before that I felt like maybe my epilepsy wasnt so bad anymore because the seizures were rare and I felt maybe I didnt need meds anymore. Not until I couldnt afford my meds did I realize how much they were controlled by my medication. It took me 5 years to find the right medication. I was trying different meds/combinations. I was miserable until I got on lamictal at 13 years old. I've been on it for 10 years this year. There was a year when my seizures were worse but it was bc I was going through a lot of stress and life changes. They added Topamax on top for extra protection. Idk how to describe it. The side effects of lamictal subsided after a year and now I dont feel any side effects. Now my life is manageable. Its frustrating and may take some time to find the right medication.
relationships,fqp0p7m,t1_fqp02m2,1589530883.0,Oh no :( that's what they all say. I said that too when I was young. Now I realize how I was groomed. If you have to say you're mature for your age to justify the relationship it's not right. I hope she realizes the type of situation she is in :/

Epilepsy,fqesacw,t3_ghz07d,1589312762.0,Happens to me. Did you hit your head or face? If it's new for you and you're concerned talk to your doctor.
AmItheAsshole,fqbf31x,t3_ghp4p6,1589235804.0,"NTA. I have epilepsy and my triggers are sleep deprivation, illness, stress and missed medication. When I used to drive if I even was a LITTLE sleep deprived I wouldnt drive because of the slight chance something could happen. Usually I wouldnt have a seizure unless sleep deprivation + illness but that was my responsibility to be careful."
AmItheAsshole,fpytixf,t1_fpuwtak,1589008955.0,Thank you. I'm sorry for your loss as well.
AmItheAsshole,fpuwose,t3_gfnsmj,1588926353.0,"NTA. My mom died recently and I would have been upset about something like this too. I joke around a lot and send reaction pics but not about someone's dead relative. Also, it was not ok for him to tell you that you were being ""too emotional"". I could've understood that maybe he was trying to make you feel better but when he said you were being too emotional he was TA. He doesnt understand how you're feeling rn. Sorry OP."
Epilepsy,fof0m16,t3_g74ubv,1587721612.0,"I feel that sometimes. My doctors have called them absence seizures, Complex Partials or Petit Mal seizures. I feel a deja vu feeling but am still aware and can still talk. I would definitely call your doctor or neurologist if you have one. If you can, record when you get these feelings. Date and time. Also anything you feel could be related. Did you eat well? Sleep deprived? Stressed? This could help find a pattern and to show your doctor the frequency.

Edit: also I'm sorry you're feeling this way! I hope you find a solution soon. PM if you need to talk or anything :)"
Epilepsy,fo5nr63,t3_g5u9qo,1587530364.0,"Hi! I started Lamictal when I was 13 and I'm about to turn 23. So 10 years on lamictal. For the 1st 6 months I would feel tired as we were figuring out what dose worked best for me. During that time I would be moody and would become angry, frustrated and irritable. Once i had a good balance of lamictal I went back to normal. I was diagnosed at 8 years old and it took 5 years to find the right medication (lamictal) and I'm grateful. It wasn't an easy journey but I'm grateful for Lamictal. Of course everyone is different."

kratom,fo2733v,t1_fnkundr,1587451819.0,Thank you for the feedback. I'm feeling more comfortable now. My brother brought me back a pound of white beer salt and it was packaged in a way that made it look like coke if not for the beer salt label and they never flagged his bag. So I'm hoping the kratom shouldn't be a big deal lol. I'm flying out of the same airport.
kratom,fo26tf6,t1_fnl5v9a,1587451568.0,Thank you for this tip! I'm going to the store this week so I'll need to pick up a protein shaker.

kratom,fo26ml8,t1_fnldv3k,1587451395.0,I'm definitely going to try tomorrow with a small dose. I've read the horror stories of a Toss and wash gone wrong lol so I'm nervous about coughing. Thank you for the detailed instructions. I'm hoping it goes well!

ChildrenofDeadParents,fnglawx,t1_fne1uag,1586935926.0,Thank you for your support ‚ù§ definitely will reach out. I'm also here for you if you need anything. I'm so sorry for your loss. I was so numb when if first happened. Not until I flew home and wasn't greeted with a hug and smile when I got home did I realize the reality of what had happened. I cant believe I've made it this long. I go day by day. I'm here for you if you ever need to talk. We're all in this together.

ChildrenofDeadParents,fnd4bzk,t3_g11u93,1586858238.0,"I feel the same way. My mom died a year ago. I've been able to distract myself. I'm in college. School has slowed down. I was living in another state and I remember being on the phone with my little brother hearing him asking the paramedics if they could please shock her heart (use the defibrillator) or if there was anything they could do. He found her cold but was in shock obviously. I see peers complaining that their parents are annoying but I would do anything to be quarantined with my mom. To hear her laugh and watch movies with her. To have her wake me up early. The house doesnt feel the same without her. I miss hugging her everyday. Her clothes smell like her. When I miss her hugs I just go to her closet, close my eyes and hug her clothes so I can feel like I'm hugging her. Life without her is miserable. I feel so alone. I dont know how I can keep living without her. She was my best friend."
Epilepsy,fk3chaw,t3_fg1e9o,1583826764.0,Lamictal 300 mg AM and 400 mg PM. I couldnt afford my medication so I was out for 5 days. On the 3rd day I started feeling twitchy. Day 4 constantly shaky and couldnt think properly. I put on my pants inside out. Couldnt talk without messing up my words. Day 5 felt auras all day but I was able to get my meds that day. I think what saved me from a grand mal was the ativan.

It may not seem like a big deal because this is the first time but it'll happen again.
Edit: he was also mad at me for being upset with him for hitting me the first time. ""I've never hit you before. Why would you accuse me of being such a bad person??"" He would be mad at me everytime for being hurt. After, he would shower me with love and gifts but never acknowledged what he did."
ChronicPain,fi36lsc,t1_fi2igs8,1582103464.0,I will Google. Is it ok to PM you tomorrow? Im going to start my lists and cooking ideas then for weekend shopping.
ChronicPain,fi36jxx,t1_fi2kiqp,1582103390.0,Okay I will look. Oh and the broth for nausea days sounds like a good idea! I would have never thought of that! Thank you for the advice.

ChronicPain,fi36d1v,t1_fi2wnwt,1582103117.0,The frozen route is sounding very good. When I'm in a lot of pain I heat up a bag of birdseye sweet corn sometimes and eat with a spoon. I'll have to expand on my frozens.
ChronicPain,fi36app,t1_fi31k1e,1582103023.0,My mouth is watering. I will look this weekend. Thank you!
ChronicPain,fi369ko,t1_fi31jie,1582102977.0,Recipes saved for reference! Going grocery shopping this weekend. We have a thrift shop a couple miles away from us so I'll have to walk there to get an estimate on how much to save. Yes I'll need one built like a tank lol! I'm into durability. Yes at the beginning of the day I feel hopeful about cooking but by the end I'm so exhausted. The crock pot is my best bet. You can cook eggs without popping oil???? What a relief. I could not make eggs without long sleeves and gloves because I was so scared. It took me 22 years to learn this lol. Thank you for the advice :)
ChronicPain,fi3632e,t1_fi313p4,1582102718.0,Saved for reference! Thank you so much. I need all the luck. I try to suck it up and I'm scared to ask for help sometimes.

I appreciate the time you took to respond to my need for help. I'm grateful. When I'm feeling alone at home I sometimes smell her clothes so I can feel like shes with me. I'm going to communicate more with my brother and set up a meal plan/schedule to accommodate my pain and any events that may come up. We're so busy sometimes we dont get the chance to just express our feelings. We're all that we have. I'm proud of how much we both have grown up since our mom died. I wish it didnt happen like this. Hes learning about housework and you're right his future family will be glad. I hope I'm doing a good job raising him. I'm just taking the lessons my mom taught me but teaching him in a sibling way. I sometimes worry if I'm doing a good job. I have an appointment next week so I'll discuss with my doctor. I'll look into a life coach. Thank you for the love üíï I feel so warm in my heart right now.

ChronicPain,fi2c7lb,t1_fi2b5pr,1582076376.0,This weekend I'll have to get sandwich stuff because these nights are inevitable and are happening more frequently. I might try the eggs. My mom would always laugh at me because I would be scared of the oil popping lol. Thank you

ChronicPain,fhrclb2,t3_f4kh9i,1581822876.0,"Hello! A lurker but I wanted to add my experience. I've been on pain management for almost 4 years. One question: does your doctor prescribe rescue doses? So say your pain is worse than usual can you have an extra dose without being short at the end of the month? Does your doctor seem understanding? I feel as long as you have 1-2 left you should be fine. You have proof that you didnt take them all at once. I've had honest discussions with my doctor even though I was scared about her dropping me but she understood and we made a plan. If your doctor doesn't understand and doesnt make a plan this is your ""first offense"" so he should give you a warning. Hopefully he is sympathetic and writes for rescue doses if you do not already have them. I also understand that not all doctors are like mine but since you dont have a history of this and have been complying with treatment you should be fine. Hope you're feeling better :)"
