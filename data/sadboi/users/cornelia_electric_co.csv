unpopularopinion,fqbi832,t1_fqb5ql2,1589237465.0,"The point is kind of like how there’s no white history month because every month is white history month. Mansplainers assume that women in particular don’t get complex concepts and need it explained to them. A popular example is a man explaining to Rebecca Solnit what her own book does as if she didn’t write it and is not an expert in it. Men are typically presumed to be experts. At, say, a medical conference, everyone assumes a man is a doctor even when he’s actually not; at that same conference, the women there are not all assumed to be doctors. Or, once, I got laid off, and the CEO of the nonprofit I worked for took me to lunch. He turned to my supervisor and said “What else could she do? She could work in green energy...,” and I said, “What I do next has nothing to do with you. I’ll make that decision.” But it was assumed that I needed these men’s help even though they were the ones who were too stupid to put Google Analytics into the website before hiring someone to run it and having her move from California to DC.  

Mansplaining (a term I have never used in real life) isn’t the same as just being a condescending prick in the same way that, while it is true that all lives matter, Black Lives Matters is important because, as a society, we do not treat black lives as if they matter. In other words, it points out that this is more likely to happen to women and that people assume women lack expertise in their own fields. It may have lost some of its original meaning via its colloquial use, but it isn’t the same as just condescending to someone. Most men don’t condescend to other men in the same way they do with women."

It’s an education program that makes citizens literate enough to engage in representative democracy (arguably, that’s high school’s job, but we’ve made high school so test centered that it barely does that now). Really, college should just be free the way K-12 is (I know it’s not “free;” it’s supported by taxpayers, but you implicitly agreed to have your taxes fund things you might not use or like when you paid them or voted or used roads or libraries or attended elementary through high school).

Also, I did not pay for college (or, I didn’t pay out of pocket). I got scholarships and assistantships to pay my tuition and living expenses. The state paid for my degrees because, at least in theory, the US values education, wants an educated citizenry, and I did well enough that schools fought for me to attend them.

Do you think that education has little to no value for society as a whole? Because that is what “You want it. You pay for it” suggests. We live in a society. Unless you live in an off-grid cabin somewhere, you benefit from things in which society invests, and that includes education."

In high school, you’re at best able to get a part-time job. You can’t pay (most) tuitions and living expenses (and living expenses can be more expensive than tuition) on the little cushion you saved in high school. I know a total of one person who did that, and he went to community college the first two years, during which he worked all year probably full time or close, and then went to a mediocre in-state school—not a bad one, just not even the best in a state that doesn’t have any “name” universities—and worked in the summer, and it worked out well for him because he works really hard and did Teach for America (I think it’s a bullshit program, but it’s good for a resume), and now he makes so much money he won’t tell anyone how much. But he was the only person I knew from high school whose parents didn’t pay for at least some part of their college. 

At 18, you’re not an adult in the same way you’re an adult at 28 or 38. Your parents implicitly took responsibility for you until you could stand on your own two feet, and most parents don’t consider a job you can get with no degree one that will let their kid stand firmly on their own two feet. If parents want their kids to go to college, they should pay for it or at least prepare the kid (and not treat one better than the other) to pay their own way."

Why doesn’t it make sense? We know:
1. Mental illness often shows up in your early 20s. Selena Gomez is 27. If she’s known this for two years, it makes total sense that she has only relatively recently displayed bipolar symptoms. That makes perfect sense
2. It’s her illness, and it’s between her, her doctor, and anyone she wants to tell. You don’t need to “understand” it, and it does not need to make sense to you. Sure, she allowed you, as a fan, to know this about her. She did not encourage you to decide she’s not really bipolar and speculate about it. 
3. Some people with mental health disorders are misdiagnosed many times throughout their treatment. It’s possible she’s been misdiagnosed (A friend wrote and published an entire memoir about her bipolar disorder only to later find out that she had been misdiagnosed, but she does still have a mental health diagnosis), or the depression diagnosis could have been wrong. But it’s not your business. Believe her. 
4. She didn’t share her diagnosis so you could say, “I don’t know. Doesn’t fit to me. I never saw her have a manic episode.” She shared it to make her mostly young, mostly female fans feel empowered to talk about their own diagnoses. You doing this here undermines that effort. 
5. “I’m just a more curious person than you” is a bullshit humblebrag you made so you could gossip about and question a pop star’s mental health status without looking like a jerk.

I experience anxiety and depression, but I don’t think they’re related to weed. I think people who are depressive and anxious are more likely to enjoy weed and other drugs that relax us. Some people don’t like feeling “out of control,” which isn’t how I’ve ever felt stoned (drunk, yes, but I don’t drink anymore; it’s bad for the pain, and honestly, I don’t remember what it felt like!), but I understand the impulse, and they’d undercut my thesis here if I didn’t think they had a different kind of anxiety than we depressives do maybe."

It’s so good. It juxtaposes her past recreational opioid use against her current medicinal use for chronic pain. Her prose is so incredible—tense and poetic and darkly funny—and she does all this cool formal experimentation (like, one essay looks like those info sheets you get with Rxs, two look like motel keys, one is a map). It’s sort of like if Maggie Nelson’s BLUETS and Joyce Carol Oates’ “Where are You Going...” had a baby.


Cathy Park Hong’s MINOR FEELINGS was way better than I expected. It’s a really detailed and nuanced exploration into Asian-American identity (like, the model minority idea and how that can hurt US citizens and immigrants. So, it’s part memoir, part social commentary, part history, part meditation. It’s kind of a cross between THE EMPATHY EXAMS and HEAVY (Kiese Laymon).

I also adored Carley Moore’s novel THE NOT WIVES (Feminist Press). It takes place during OWS and meditates on what love means in late capitalism without feeling “philosophical;” like, you want to know what happens, but you can’t help but think about your own relationships while you read it—queer and sex positive! 

Sophia Shalmiyev’s memoir MOTHER WINTER (Random House?) about her childhood in the Soviet Union, her mom’s alcoholism, and her and her dad’s immigration to the US was my favorite book of 2019. Just absolutely beautiful sentences, all fire and no ice; so good. 

Susan Steinberg’s first novel, MACHINE (Graywolf) is amazing. I read it in a day. It’s hard to describe like how all of Steinberg’s writing is hard to describe, but it’s kind of a coming-of-age novel, kind of a murder mystery but way literary. Johanna Stoberock’s PIGS is awesome—a Lord of the Flies-type story but cooler—as is Alex DiFrancesco’s work (I prefer their essay collection PSYCHOPOMPS, but they have two novels out with Civil Coping Mechanisms and and a new one on the way with a new publisher (Little, Brown? Flatiron? Unsure) this or next year. 

I’m really excited about Lisa Olstein’s PAIN STUDIES (Bellevue), a history of migraine + memoir blended in, and GOOD MORNING, DESTROYER OF MEN’S SOULS (FSG, I think?) by Nina Renata Aron; they’re in the mail on their way to me now. Sejal Shah has a great essay collection coming out soon, too, called THIS IS ONE WAY TO DANCE (U of Georgia Press). Looking forward to Sarah Gerard’s BLACK HEART and Adam Wilson’s new one (I cant think of the title, but it has a kind of neon cover with a mirrored Victoria house on it in white.

I’m asking why it’s apparently ethical to do anything you want to an animal even if what you do hurts the animal. It’s not just that I dislike animal mistreatment or feel bad for the animals. It’s that, if you adopt or buy a dog, why do you not have an ethical obligation to take care of the dog? And, if you agree that you have an ethical obligation to take care of your dog, why would you not have an ethical obligation to minimize dogs’ suffering as best you can by adopting one from a shelter rather than buying one from a breeder and that, from there, it follows that breeding dogs is unethical because there are already too many who don’t have homes.  

The dog may not be capable of moral judgment or rational thought, but you are. It’s not moral or rational to say “I don’t care about the millions of dogs in shelters who need loving homes. I’m going to make new dogs people can buy, which will decrease the chance that the shelter dogs will get adopted.” As humans, breeders know or should know that what they do contributes to overcrowded shelters. So, is the breeder acting ethically? Is the breeder’s customer?  

What if I just insisted that I wanted to have my own baby and spent years and a small fortune on IVF when I could have adopted a kid instead? Is it ethical for me to say “I know the world is already full of children who don’t have homes, and it is unlikely that I’ll conceive on my own, but I want a baby who shares my DNA, so I’ll keep doing this, maybe move to more extreme measures such as surrogacy, and create a new child even though I could adopt one who really needs me and already exists”?"

I think formal ethics and ethical decisions in the real world are different or even that this “Personhood is a prerequisite...” idea is from a certain branch of philosophy or just his educated opinion. I’ve seen some philosophers (Donna Haraway, Peter Singer) even deal with the ethics of our relationships with animals.

I think it would have worked better to give money to all people 18-24 to avoid situations like u/dirtfather’s. It’s better to accidentally give out money to people who don’t need it (and whose spending would help the economy) than to not give it to kids whose parents don’t pay for college."

Who says that animals are incapable of making moral decisions? Are you a dog? Do you have a technology that allows you to see where moral decision-making does or doesn’t take place in an animal’s brain? If so, the world would like to hear about it. And, even if animals aren’t rational beings or in possession of consciousness, why is it ethical to deny them rights because they aren’t people? That sounds a lot like a theory people would develop to justify their treatment of animals. Is the question whether dog breeding can be subject to ethics? Because dogs don’t breed themselves. We love that Bob Barker used to end every The Price is Right episode with “Spay and neuter your cats and dogs” because we don’t want to put more animals in shelters or on the streets, and we don’t want to create new animals just so they can die in a shelter (or so that the animal you would have picked had that one not been there won’t get euthanized). If you insist that ethics only apply to those we’ve granted “personhood” status, do we as people not have an ethical obligation to ameliorate the suffering of other sentient beings (especially where we can)?

changemyview,flq672j,t1_flnxk92,1585380750.0,"Sexism doesn’t mean what you think it means. It is not “when you only consider one [sex’s] desires.” In the dictionary, it’s defined as “prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination, typically against women, on the basis of sex.” So, if I told you that all men were horn-dog pigs who only liked women when the women were fucking them, I guess you could call that sexist, but it has no real weight. There isn’t any stigma attached to men who fuck a lot of women they don’t really know. You can’t just reverse the gender in these situations since one side has power, and the other side doesn’t. 

In your “It’s sexist that you say men need to change, and you only see it from the women’s side” diatribe, you ignore that the default side is the masculine side. Any other way of seeing something is non-normative and potentially dangerous or scandalous and worthy of punishment of some kind. You think I’m only seeing it from women’s sides because you’ve only ever had to see things from a man’s side. I have had to know what men think my entire life. Like how black people have to know how white people think of them to keep themselves safe (like “Your white friends might can joke with police officers, but you can’t; you might get killed”). 

If you’re “well past school,” my thinking you’re in college based on your ideas isn’t something you can use to belittle me. 

Can you clarify your point about the ways in which a more sexist society (but if you’re claiming there’s no more sexism, I can’t get on board with that, and I’m really not on board with you at all because you are being mean. I have been polite and have tried to explain my perspective to you, and I feel like you don’t hear it because you keep coming back to the same arguments. We finally got somewhere when you said “The world was way better for men but not women, so from an equality perspective...,”—I mean, what kind of statement is that? What does it mean? Sexism is not a zero-sum game. You might like Michael Kimmel‘s work on how patriarchy hurts men and boys and how efforts to make things better for girls usually ends in things also being better for men, too. 

Wait, I’m sorry. What kind of word salad is “Men are stronger than women and they use their superior physical strength to physically dominate women”? Can you please clarify that paragraph. Do you mean to say that, in the past, men were stronger and dragged women into caves to rape them, and that is simply men’s nature, and it is very hard for them to exist within human society? I mean, I get it. It’s social Darwinism. It’s bullshit. I’m sure the earliest iterations of women differed little from those of what we now call men. Or, I’m sure that paleolithic women were stronger than women are now. And all of that is irrelevant here. 

I’m not sure you understand what I said about intelligence, accomplishments, and ambition or whatever. I meant, I suppose, to ask why I shouldn’t, for instance, work on my second book because no man will care that I’ve published a book. But it’s not just the accomplishment itself. It’s that writing is an integral part of my life, and without it I would be a different person. If a man doesn’t care about things that are important to me, why am I supposed to at least devalue (at most reject) the things in my life that matter to me just because they aren’t the reason a man would love me (and would make me less valuable to a man because it makes me less like the easygoing college girls men would prefer to date)? That’s how I’ve interpreted your statements on this topic in past posts. Was I wrong to do that?

Okay. Who decided that wealth and status were important. Was it women? Did women decide they shouldn’t have power, the ability to earn money or own property, vote, etc. and should instead have to “take” them from men? That’s a pretty rich way to put it. But, no, those aren’t the things women value in men. Sure, some do just as some men value women for their looks alone. They aren’t the majority, though. Most women want men they can trust, and it happens that trustworthy people more often have the kinds of things that signify success here. We aren’t talking abut Nobel Prizes. We’re talking about jobs that pay a mortgage and provide decent lives for kids. It is possible that I just want different things in a man than most women do, but most of the time, when my sister’s friends, who are more status obsessed than mine, get a new boyfriend, they ask her if he’s nice first. Like, actually nice. Does he love you? It’s not “How much money does he make, and how big is his dick? You’d better get ready to dump him if they’re deemed insufficiently masculine.”

Your refusal to even consider any of this from a woman’s POV isn’t helping you not come across as a sociopath or at least a man with no empathy. 

There is so much misogyny and sexism in your reply that my jaw literally went slack as I read it. Have you seen a professional about your issues with women? Have your friends? 

I mean, really, it’s not that hard. Women value men for tons of different reasons, but typically, if we’re straight, we want what you want: a man we find attractive who can take care of himself and (in some cases) will make a good father, is kind and funny and otherwise all-around pleasant to hang out with (not that he can never complain—just that no one wants to date Eeyore), is empathetic and smart or witty, interesting and interested in things that are not only sports, is communicative and a good listener, and is honest and loyal and trustworthy. Or, that’s what I want. Another woman could come along and say something totally different. We aren’t a monolith. I don’t speak for all women. 

But we aren’t aliens. It’s not that hard to figure out what traits we might value. But if you keep acting as though men are entitled to mates (you’re not, and neither am I; some of us will spend our lives without a longterm partner not necessarily because we don’t deserve love but because we were unlucky or did things wrong. I’m sorry someone gave you the impression that women only value men for their money, but now that we can make our own money, we’re freed up to think about the other things we want in a partner, and we’re less likely to put up with abuse, poor treatment, or general dickery. This also frees you from the patriarchal requirement that you serve as sole breadwinner and almost never see your family and allows you to spend more time with your kids and/or spouse, have and share feelings or otherwise violate gendered norms that don’t serve you. I understand why a man wouldn’t want to dismantle patriarchy, but most men don’t understand that patriarchy limits their freedom, too. We should all want to demolish patriarchy. 

If you’re in college, I implore you take a women’s/gender studies course. Take a literature class that centers on women writers (or musicians or directors or painters or photographers—anything! You might even find one on women in STEM!). 

Read novels, memoirs, poetry, and plays by women. Try to see what life is like for us and see us as fully fleshed out, lovely, flawed, complicated people with as much intrinsic value as you have. 

If men adored women and valued the work we did in the home—keeping the house clean; the kids fed, bathed, read to, and put to bed; the clothes washed and appointments and etc.—Betty Friedan wouldn’t have been able to write The Feminine Mystique, the book would never have sold as well as it did or resonated with so many (mostly white, middle/upper class) women, and we wouldn’t still teach it along with The Second Shift (Arlie Hoschild). 

If men just want to love women who be loved back, how do you explain cheating and verbal or physical abuse? If a man would be so grateful to me for taking him up on his date offer that he would (in your argument’s world) stop resenting and treating women violently or poorly in any of the many ways available to him, why would he ever step out on me, choke me, leave me, yell at me, belittle me, humiliate me, or hit me?

And have you ever considered that maybe we don’t want to be adored or put on a pedestal? Maybe we want appreciation, respect, comfort, friendship, to feel secure in our relationships and know that our partners truly love us. But love and admiration or adulation or adoration are not the same things. Love is an action. It happens because we making choices, and one of those choices his whom to love. We spend a lot of time getting shit on by men (from middle school to infinity or, in some cases, menopause), so we might need more time before we settle in and feel solid in our partnership. 

Do you see the irony in your assertion that older women are too damaged to deserve the love of these disproportionately picky “lost men”? And how can you say men want to love women when men don’t care about women’s desires, intelligence, ambitions, or accomplishments and that, since men don’t care about these things, women shouldn’t either? Are you saying that we should care about people who don’t care about us? That isn’t love. That is objectification; we are only valuable to the degree that we make men happy. 

Not many of us will sacrifice everything we care about for someone who doesn’t care that we care about things or support us and our goals. Do you intend to say “Men only value women for their bodies and their pleasant demeanors. Men don’t care about anything women do or say or think. They only care about what women look like, what women can do for them, and how women make them feel”?

changemyview,flm546x,t1_flhk77k,1585274791.0,"So, what do we do with abused dogs? Do they not deserve to live? It’s relatively easy to predict what circumstances make dogs more likely to hurt people, and those dogs often undergo training or are given to rescue organizations that can socialize the dog or, in the worst cases, don’t even make it to the shelter before they’re put down. If “temperament” is a synonym for “personality” here, too bad; it’s still wrong to leave millions of dogs in shelters so you can gamble on a breed that MIGHT have a calmer or more obedient temperament or MIGHT be skilled at X task (unless you’re a law-enforcement officer or a disabled person who relies on a dog for assistance, you don’t need a dog who MIGHT can be trained to learn X special skill because the breed has a tendency toward X). Regular people do not need special dogs. 

I understand why people don’t want to adopt a dog who will bite them and cause them a lot of trouble, but that’s sort of not how dogs work (have you ever met a puppy? They’re all crazy regardless of breed, and they almost invariably calm as they age). You can hang out with or foster a shelter dog before you commit to an adoption and use that trial period to figure out if you’re a good enough caretaker to meet the dog’s needs. 

Any trauma-related bad behavior is not the dog’s fault, and if the dog hasn’t yet learned to follow human norms, it’s your job to teach the dog, which you’d still have to do with bred puppies at least, so if you end up with a “bad” adult dog, that’s your fault, not the breed’s.

Would you say that people shouldn’t adopt abused kids? With your own kid, you can better control what type of temperament the kid will have, and the kid won’t have to unlearn coping skills it used to deal with a stressful environment. If you have your own kid, you won’t need to train out behaviors you don’t like (“How does this foster kid not know we don’t let kids on the good furniture in this house?”). 

I don’t get the obsession with breeds at all. Why does a person who just wants a dog care what breed the dog is or what special skills it might be able to cultivate? I’m serious. Who cares, and why do they?

But behavior issues aren’t flaws that make a dog “a lemon.” They’re actions the dog can be trained to stop doing or that the human can learn to deal with or mitigate the damage the animal might do.

But, more important, what does men getting physically injured by other men have to do with how women treat men. You can’t blame women for man-on-man crime, and men also commit most violent acts against women, so the point is really that men are violent. And are you really saying that being emotionally, sexually, and physically hurt and violated against your will is the same degree of awful as getting rejected? Because it’s not (even if the rejector is mean). 

That’s a novel reply to “Why do men prefer younger women” that serves your argument suspiciously well. Do you have a source for this?

It sounds as if you’re arguing that men want women to adore them. What do the men do to elicit or deserve adulation? And how do you imagine they treat the women they date? Are the women also worthy of admiration?

ETA: Women can’t be sexist toward men. We can be prejudiced or biased, but we can’t be sexist because sexism is a set of beliefs that have become hegemonic—in other words, women don’t have the structural power to dominate men."

What is the point in breeding labs and retrievers or labradors and poodles? Like, why is that a thing people should be able to do when we already have more shelter dogs than we can home? Why is a labrador retriever better than any shelter dog?"
changemyview,flf2ug9,t1_flexnlu,1585096814.0,"Yes, I can. Because, when I go to a bar, I don’t worry about men treating me poorly when I hit on them; I worry that one will drug my drink, follow me to the bathroom or out the door, and rape and/or murder me.

It’s hard for women to sympathize with men who complain about not getting dates because we also have that problem (we hit “the wall” at 30, men want to date our younger counterparts, most men treat us to some degree like shit [including the actual nice men—they’re cold or not great at communicating or whatever], the guys we like don’t like us, etc.); we’re carrying baggage from men who have abused us; AND we‘re trying to love people who, as a class, are dismissive, sexist, and oppressive toward us.

You’re talking about the effects a few years of getting verbally eviscerated has on men who approach random women at bars. (Does this actually happen? I’ve never seen it happen and don’t know any women who are mean to men who hit on them regardless of the man’s looks—every woman I know would at least be nice out of fear—but I hear men say it happens all the time.) Women are talking about centuries of oppression at men’s hands. It’s not the same. To ask women to help men date seems a little tone deaf in that context. I understand what you’re saying, but I’m not mean to men in the ways you’ve listed, so I don’t know what I would change there unless I literally dated someone with whom I don’t want that type of relationship. 

I didn’t say men should do XYZ and everything will get better; I said it would behoove them to start there. But we might have to teach men to get over it the way we have with women. Should we tell people early on in life that maybe there isn’t “someone for everyone.” Should we make the nuclear family and the couple less important socioeconomically? Yes. But we can’t force women to date men they don’t want to date. 

You’re still putting men’s feelings at the center of this. I think listening to women and putting our needs at the center of the approach rather than centering that effort on their own desires. Or maybe men could be a little more patient. I mean, if I can date after having been raped by a date, I think a man can learn to be nice to women even if they say mean things to him when he hits on them. Perhaps try to see it from our side. Think of and treat us the way you would your friends rather than as people with whom you hope to one day have sex. There’s no secret. Attraction always works differently. But no one wants to think she’s just a receptacle for men’s feelings and genitals."

So, is it that the women in AITA (UO is almost entirely men and kind of obviously skewed toward dicks; I could have picked better examples, but I used the subs I’d just come from) are terrible and are this also terrible to other women, or is it that the women are terrible, so of course people call them assholes? I think women are more likely to be called assholes on AITA than men are (except that men are probably more likely to act like assholes and ask the internet to tell them whether they did or not), especially if they breach gender norms. But you also never see assholes on there. It’s almost always NTA, NAH, or ESH."
