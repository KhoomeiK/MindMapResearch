2. Minutemen: the Minutemen are homies! You don’t get shit for choosing this ending except feeling morally right and you get to blow up a big fucking bomb. I like their “lets all work together to fix the Commonwealth” plan. 
3. The Institute: you nailed it. Institute is trash and Shaun can suck a fat dick
4. The Railroad: pretty sure the entire Railroad storyline was an afterthought. I didn’t find it very memorable but the silenced Deliverer you can buy from them is one of my favorite guns in the game"
