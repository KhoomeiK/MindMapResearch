Instead, mix  the medications with something that will ""ruin"" them, like cat litter or leftover paint, then throw them in the trash. Meds in the water supply are difficult to remove. Or as others have said, take them to a leftover medication drop off location. Pharmacies and police stations commonly have one."

A month ago while riding a high mood, I was ranting, basically yelling, at work about how I was going to start a successful mushroom farm and be rich by the end of the summer and this job can suck it. Yes I do know how to grow gourmet mushrooms on a small scale at my house, but am I going to start a farm? Probably fucking not. I've got a closet full of mushroom lab equipment that I've barely used this summer now that the depressive side is in full swing.  

I've been at this job for about 9 months and I love it, but I hate that everyone knows how weird my head is. I suspect the shame that folks like us internalize day after day is what makes keeping a steady job so difficult."
