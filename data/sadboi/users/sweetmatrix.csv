I absolutely LOVE the necklace/key idea. I’d thought of using her diary as evidence, I hadn’t thought of keeping it hidden for the protagonist to find but I think that’s brilliant! I’d also thought of having B contact old friends, but I wasn’t sure how to make them useful, the code idea is really interesting! And it could be useful to maybe get old notes or letters from the victim that would help prove the diaries authenticity. (Seeing as they would use the same code, same handwriting, etc.)

I couldn’t decide if I would have the victim tell our protagonist who the killer was, but I think it would be really fun and more “high stakes” trying to pin the former chief of police without him catching wind of her investigation.

As for the body, I’m considering having it buried somewhere that the killer was/is known to frequent while also keeping it “public” enough that suspicion isn’t immediately placed on him. Perhaps near his favorite fishing/camping spot? Or just outside of his property line somewhere?

I’ve had trouble with coming up with the cause of death. I want the weapon to be traced back to the killer but it can’t be so easy that it’s literally a smoking gun spoiling the potential for further sleuthing. This is because I want the body to be found pretty early on and therefore cause of death/weapon used, so it can’t be too obvious.

Anyway, thanks so much for all of your help and suggestions! I’ll definitely be using some and am very appreciative!"

Supernatural,fqsqjey,t3_gkcaif,1589615340.0,"I actually disagree....I’ve binged the season tonight for the first time and I’ve enjoyed it far more than I have for the past several seasons. For a while it’s almost been a chore for me to keep up with Supernatural, which is strange because its so special to me. It’s been a huge part of my life since I was twelve, and my mom and I have bonded so much over it.

This season, I’ve actually laughed at the jokes, I’ve gotten emotional during the bits where we’re supposed to get emotional. The show doesn’t feel like a parody of itself like it has for the last few seasons (at least imo), it feels like Supernatural again. Sam and Dean almost feel like they’re back. I’m not saying it’s perfect, there have been questionable moments for sure.

I don’t know, maybe for me I just have to like the last season or I’ll lose my mind lmao!! Apart from the first few episodes which I agree were....not great...I haven’t felt like the show has been circle jerking us; for the past few seasons that’s all I’ve felt. After that though, I think they’ve done pretty well. I especially love everything they’ve done with Rowena, she’s gotten the ending she deserved. Maybe that’s the unpopular opinion but oh well!"

mentalhealth,fqmoumq,t1_fqmnl91,1589481027.0,"You are absolutely not weak. I promise you that crying does not make you weak. It’s healthy and normal. I do encourage you to let yourself feel and process everything you’ve been going through. It’s not good to keep it all bottled up. 

I know that’s way easier said than done, especially when you’ve trained yourself against it. But I commend you for wanting to try, and sometimes that’s enough.

Life is the worst rollercoaster you will ever ride. But it’s also the best one. We all have ups and downs. Things won’t be great all the time and we certainly won’t feel great all the time. If we felt great all the time then we’d be manic and that’s a whole other set of problems. And in those times where things aren’t so great it’s okay to break down a little bit. Because hopefully we come back up a little better for it.

It’s like when you work out and your muscles tears a little bit and you might be sore, but with rest and time they eventually heal and become stronger."

mentalillness,fqmmq1a,t3_gjkig2,1589480013.0,"He doesn’t sound dangerous, he sounds ill. I have a cacophony of intrusive thoughts, I’m not dangerous though.

I would talk with him sincerely about going to see someone. Tell him that he’s not a bad person for having these intrusive thoughts. He’s not a bad person for having mental health problems. And tell him that no doctor or therapist will think he is a bad person or tell him that he is one, they’ll diagnose him. And provide him proper treatment. And if he’s afraid of getting a diagnosis because he’s afraid of what the diagnosis might be just assure him that a diagnosis does not define him. It’s not an intrinsic part of him, it’s more like a malignant cancer. He’s right in saying that the intrusive thoughts and mental illness are not him, but they do have to be treated and dealt with or they will not go away and only continue to worsen.

If he has to ask himself constantly if he’s a bad person, he probably isn’t one. If he was a bad person he wouldn’t care.

There are actually a lot of benefits that come from crying. It’s a huge release. Everyone needs to do it every once in a while. I mean, there’s a reason we’re wired to do it.

I don’t know to how to help you like...induce a sob session but I guess I’ll just tell you that you shouldn’t be afraid to do it, or feel like less of a man or whatever. Because that’s stupid. Since when did a normal human action turn into something to be ashamed of?

mentalillness,fqky0ef,t3_gizoqc,1589439703.0,"I want to start off by saying that I’m really sorry this has happened to you. In my opinion, you have been treated absolutely unfairly and what they’ve done to you is so wrong on every level. I’ve been in therapy and seeing psychiatrists for years and there have been times where I actually have been non-compliant and difficult and none of them ever refused to treat me or gave up on me. I’ve also been on a multitude of medications and doses, I have a laundry list of diagnoses...so a complex case doesn’t seem like a good reason for dismissal. Mental illness is intrinsically complex.

I don’t think that they had a good reason to stop your treatment. You clearly haven’t been non-compliant, there’s no reason they should be dropping your case.

I don’t know if you can do anything about it, I would try to talk to your new psychiatrist when you find one or even your regular doctor/primary care physician about the situation. And if it helps I’m pretty sure that your regular doctor can prescribe you the medicine you need while trying to find another psychiatrist, at least the doctors where I am from (southern U.S.) can do that.

I can’t imagine how confused, scared, angry, and upset you’re feeling so I had to reach out and let you know that you’re not wrong for feeling that way and that they have treated you monstrously. I hope you get in with another doctor soon because I know how difficult it is to go without treatment. I’m thinking about you, good luck and stay safe! Feel free to message me any time if you need it."
mentalillness,fqkwg8i,t3_gjeedb,1589438324.0,"I don’t think it’s necessarily a bad thing but I also don’t think it’s healthy. Like, it’s a coping mechanism of sorts, which you can’t be faulted for, it’s just not a good one.

I can tend to do the same thing with my kindness and goodness. If I make a mistake or do something that I consider to be out of line with those ideals, I can spiral. Like killing a bug. Or tonight I had a small fight with my friends where I was at fault and had a meltdown. I can’t give myself the grace to make mistakes and occasionally be a bad person like everyone else who has ever walked the earth because being a good person is the only thing I have. As a result, when I do make a mistake or am criticized by a friend it can cut pretty deep.

I don’t have a lot of advice for you because if I had the answer I wouldn’t be doing the same thing. You’re not alone though.

It is good to remind yourself though that you don’t have to be or do anything to earn worth or value. We are all inherently valuable and worthy simply because we are human and we exist. I gather a little comfort from that sentiment anyways.

Try to work on praising yourself for other small things, or maybe develop another skill that you can place self esteem and worth into. Maybe an instrument. I mean you can get a ukulele for like thirty bucks and learn three chords to play a million songs. Or write some short stories. Anything small that can bring you joy.

I’ve been singing and working on my voice and that helps.

Oh also, know that anyone you come across is probably not any more intelligent than you are. Nobody else really has the authority to criticize or belittle you, I mean unless you’re hanging out with a bunch of rocket scientists. It’s easier not to let people’s comments bother you so much when you take away a little bit of their power.

I don’t know, all of this is pretty basic and probably stupid but I’ve kind of been dealing with a similar thing so I thought I’d try to help lol.
