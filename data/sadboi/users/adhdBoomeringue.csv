The key to being able to do repetitive exercises is to find something you enjoy and do the repetition on that. It's like the saying ""If you love what you do, you'll never work a day in you're life""

A good way to practise this would be overdoing it. For example after you release, you hold your bow arm still for 5 seconds after the arrow hits the target, that way when you settle into a shorter time it should be easier for you.

 It's like if you want to learn to stand up straight, start by over doing it with an ""arrogant"" over the top standing straight, then as you body adjusts you should fall into a more natural way of standing up straight.

  
[Khatra](https://youtu.be/NqIteDp11AU?t=153) is usually when shooting asiatic on the right side of the bow, so you can move the bow out of the way of the arrow to aid in a cleaner trajectory. Doing it with mediterranean three fingers means you're knocking the arrow off where you were aiming."

The last one i did took me 20 minutes, I did 5 drawings and i could see very obvious improvement.Also, another thing that helps me is to try to focus on drawing without thinking about drawing, just the doing. Meditation helps with calming excess thoughts.

It's similar to the technique where you turn the reference upside down so your brain doesn't label everything and you can just draw the shapes, except in this case your just trying to ignore what ever random stuff your brain comes up with.
