My grandparents got me a charm bracelet with my name on it and added a heart on it but it was never added to and unfortunately I couldn't wear it after long because it was too small.

Ah, ah, say it's alright

Under my thumb  
It's a Siamese cat of a girl  
Under my thumb  
She's the sweetest, hmmm, pet in the world

It's down to me  
The way she talks when she's spoken to  
Down to me, the change has come  
She's under my thumb  
Ah, take it easy babe  
Yeah

It's down to me, oh yeah  
The way she talks when she's spoken to  
Down to me, the change has come  
She's under my thumb  
Yeah, it feels alright

Under my thumb  
Her eyes are just kept to herself  
Under my thumb, well I  
I can still look at someone else

If she's ready to try again and gets rude while helping you, then maybe give her a warning but definitely the second time, she's done and has to leave. Just keep doing this and do not let her get away with the behavior. If you do this method and then cave after a bit because you get tired, she gets her way and learns a horrible lesson about manipulation and getting what she wants. We don't need more entitled adults. So stick to your guns, and good luck! 

&#x200B;

I'm a teacher (I've taught preschool through second grade) and that kind of behavior is completely unacceptable even at a young age. I've barely had any students who ever acted that way, but when they did, they knew they were a big kid and that's not a respectful or appropriate way to act. If they're upset with me, they can talk to me in a polite way or take a break to be alone. However, if they're going to act like your daughter does, they know there are consequences and I won't put up with it. Good luck!"

Honestly I'd be afraid to talk to them privately. You never know who knows who.

Then I had a boss who seemed normal but she was being a hypocrite and telling us not to bother her last minute with things but then would constantly throw huge things at us last minute. I don't do well with having stuff thrown on me last minute, so after the umpteenth time, I very nicely told her ""You know, you told us not to ask you for a (certain paper document for a meeting) at the last minute, and I also don't like to be asked to do things at the last minute. So, I let it go the first couple times, but it's been happening more frequently lately that you'll ask us to fit in a project last minute during class time, and honestly it's very stressful. Please tell us ahead of time."" She seemed to understand and take it well but then she retaliated against me for it. I don't think what I said was rude at all or nitpicking or demanding or anything. Plus I didn't even get into the ridiculousness of it with her-- she doesn't like being asked for a PAPER at the last minute (Not sure what the big deal is there) but yet she OFTEN tells us to do last minute PROJECTS in the little class time we already have along with everything else we have to accomplish?! And then she appears to take it well but retaliates.

I've never heard of the one-on-one dates. I'm wondering what they specifically do there. Like, ""This is how a man should hold the chair and push the lady in"" or whatever? First of all, old fashioned, but I've had it done once in my life and it was kind of nice but point being, who needs to physically go out to dinner to explain that? You'd just say ""Pull out her chair for her"" when going over how you should act on a date.

Even for the more important things like ""Don't bring up anything controversial/personal"" or ""Check your deodorant and that there's nothing in your teeth beforehand"" is like.... why do you need to take someone out to dinner to explain that? I guess I'm just not understanding the rules for dating period and how they differ from most things. Like, the rule should be in general ""Before you leave the house, check in the mirror to make sure you don't have something on your face or in your teeth and that you don't smell or have stains on your clothes."" I mean, that's like a good daily rule to go by. As for a date, I don't remember anyone telling me ""rules"" but I think it was just sort of obvious to look decent, and then the stuff about how to behave is again just normal every day rules for the most part. ""Don't only talk about yourself-- ask them questions too but make sure they're not topics that might offend them, use table manners, say please and thank you, etc."" Again, not seeing how this is different than meeting up with family or an acquaintance or whatever. 

A good rule would be to stand up for yourself and if they want to do something you're not comfortable with, you tell them that, and if they belittle you, who cares. They're not the right choice for you. Don't be intimidated. Again, the same rule applies to friendships, but I can see telling my kid that before they started dating. Not sure why I'd have to take them out to dinner to tell them though.

I don't know, I have not been successful with dating, so maybe I'm missing something? Please tell me if I am."
