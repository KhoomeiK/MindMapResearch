You are going on about genetics being the only factor in whether someone ages well... oh and ‚Äúretinol‚Äù. I assume you are referring to retinoids which are much more powerful and prescription only but still have limited anti aging abilities compared to laser treatment and facelifts. 

Youre waaay overthinking this yet with extremely limited knowledge and without the ability to be objective. You asked for the procedures she did to look younger and I listed them.

The point you keep missing is they ALL add up to her looking younger and are not available in their entirety to the average person. Just a facelift here is $15-$50k. A laser treatment is $1-3k.
