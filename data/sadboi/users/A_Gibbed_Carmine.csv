May sound salty but I feel I get pigeonholed massively and forgotten about if I tell a neurotypical women about my diagnosis that I was trying to get kushty with.

Straight up been basically blocked after talking to ages on dating apps with women, feel safe that I should come out about my mental health, or get it out the way, then I'd just get aired all the time after.

I feel again with women I'd see on a day to day that know about my label, I feel I'm seen as a beacon of mental health problems and not taking seriously enough or ever considered as a potential partner.

I feel I'm more excepted by older women and my label doesn't get put on such a high pedestal

Edit: just wanna add more context that I've been out of hospital for 5+ years and my anti psyches do very well for me. My point is that you could literally be a normal person but the schizophrenia label is so stigmatized, you'll never be considered for a lover again if you told someone you had it"

This doesn't fill me with much hope as maybe they realised they didn't need to offer the extra incentive in order to attract more couriers during the busy late year period. They pretty much stopped the promotion half way through it.
JustEatUK,fppdfn2,t3_fm20wq,1588800269.0,"I find it can vary so much due to demand of the zone. In conjunction with Uber, my best week has been £600+ in one week since i started this time last year. If its busy, it can be pretty easy to earn yourself £300 doing five to six 4 hour shifts in a week. i find usually my average is £10 an hour at least, peaking at about £15 ph if im on a really good run. If you are in a new zone, the values they'll be paying you for per drop will be really high and sometimes they even give you £5-£10 just for doing the shift, so you can end up on us much as £20 per hour.

But i haven't made that sort of money since this time last year, since they lowed the drop values.

And yes, there are times when there are no orders on and you're making fuck all, Monday/Tuesday lunch time for example."

No matter what cable I use, it has to be in a certain position or the phone won’t charge, this is a critical error as I need my phone for work constantly.

It’s a shame as I do think the Razer phone, despite its many, many bugs, was a very good bit of kit you could get when it was going for £400 new but I’m leaving them now.

I’m hoping to switch to a Pixel when I get a cash settlement from my insurance company after they tell me they don’t have any spare Razer phones to repair/replace the one I’m going to send in with.
