PinegroveBand,fqw5r9x,t3_gl4pi1,1589693641.0,"idk. i see what she’s saying, i’ve had a few close friends, family, be raped, assaulted, and yes, coerced. it affects a person more than most of the people in these comments r assuming man. i don’t know like ANY details about this situation though. still, i hate calling her “the accuser” it sounds harsh. and no band or music means more to me than bodily autonomy. did this person genuinely feel that that was taken from them by evans actions? is this like the aziz ansari situation, is it more or less of a big deal? how did this situation affect this person in the long term? they truly could be a survivor of an action that evan made. idkkkkkkkk. i have cut people, best friends, out of my life who ended up being abusers, and even when you hate a person, you miss them, you miss the idea of the person you used to know. i love this band, and remember briefly hearing about this situation a few years ago but sort trying not to be “involved” like lomelda said. i just know that it was shady but that they were taking it seriously and apologies had happened and then eventually they were back. i dont see what i, as a passive listener, can do. we’re so removed from this incredibly vague situation, this band is just trying to make a living. in the way that i have the right to no longer be involved in my old “friends” (i don’t think of these specific ppl fondly like in the actual pinegrove song lol) lives, lomelda and the person mentioned can do the same. hell, i barely even talk to people who still associate with the abusers that i knew. we never had a conversation about it, they had the right to stick by what they believe in, and i have the right to disagree with them and remove myself from their spaces. i think it’s unwise to make it another’s duty, though. i’m not supporting a person’s actions, i’m supporting music that has helped me through tough times. this is very different to me than a real life situation. an extreme example is how i don’t support chris brown and i don’t listen to his music because of repeated violent beating of women. i don’t feel that this situation is comparable to that, either. if anything, i’m here to support band members besides evan, at least until all of this is cleared up. i’m very passionate about believing women and i do believe that cancel culture isn’t as bad as many deem it to be— there need to be repercussions for actions. given the little we know about the situation and the actions that pinegrove have taken, i feel that the most that any of us can do has been done, and that’s really it. :/"
mixedrace,fqw2ore,t3_gl96wb,1589691181.0,"i understand what she’s saying and why everyone in the comments is so frustrated— but i think it’s valid to want to see visibily ethnic people on screen. it’s cool that everyone in the cast did seem to be rather diverse culturally, but they were all white-passing. so, many POC wouldn’t necessarily see themselves in these characters, which is sad considering the fact that not only LGBTQ+ content is mostly white, but also LGBTQ+ spaces in real life are mostly white. the media upholding that only further alienates QPOC.

it’s really cool that she’s mixed! i am too, and as a mixed, QPOC individual, how does representation of an ambiguous white passing person help people like me? i have brown skin, my hair is kinky, i have african facial features. sometimes i’m a bit ambiguous but if you saw me on the street you would not miss that i’m black. so, personally, it would be more beneficial to see more brown, visibly ethnic people on screen. hollywood purposely chases people with less ethnic features because they see them as more digestible to the masses— they do this on purpose. i grew up rarely seeing myself in any of the media i loved most, even more rarely in LGBTQ+ content. it’s exhausting bro. i know the mixed struggle, never feeling enough of anything, feeling robbed of your identity, but i feel that that’s a whole separate conversation outside of representation in media."

QueerWomenOfColor,fp8xbru,t1_fp8rx0k,1588406284.0,"salam!!!!!!! :)))) i didnt know that the bisexual has MENA rep!! i know one the main actresses directed the miseducation of cameron post, a movie i loveee, dunno how i never figured that her name was arab. maybe i’ll check it out now! i’ve also seen like an episode of The Bold Type, the show wasn’t really my vibe but there’s literally a WOC couple of a black woman and an iranian hijabi lesbian woman which is pretty unique and cool. 

having worn a hijab for about a decade of my life and only taken it off in the last month or so and having some noticeable arab features as well, i know what you mean about being clocked and stared at like you’re a threat to society. it’s hell. was called a terrorist for most of adolescence, by complete strangers, by friends and even teachers (as a joke, but still a bit uncomfortable). 

besides that, most of the arabs i spent my time around at the mosque/family friends were egyptians!! love my egyptian khaltis, love when we’d go to the park and order some bizza and drink bebsi and they would call you GAmil. you guys hold a space place in my heart, i love your dialect, and i’d love to spend time in egypt. 

i agree that there isn’t much of a universal culture, but i also feel that we’re all sort of just slight variations of each other and have a lotttttt in common. i’m hoping to explore more about arab culture outside of religion. of course i can distinguish the culture from the religion but the very few arabs i know are muslim, and it’s hard to find spaces to bond with other people just on the basis of being arab. hoping to visit casablanca after corona and find my place/connect with it all a little bit more. i wholeheartedly agree that there’s more to our culture than religion. i can see it, i loved it and identified with it in the very short amount of time i spent back in the motherland as a kid my dude. 

in terms of religion, i’d say i’m definitely closer to you in belief than any muslims i know personally. wouldn’t say that i don’t identify as muslim anymore, and i appreciate religion, i’ve been fasting this ramadan, but as a lesbian growing up i don’t feel that i belong in muslim spaces and i never have, doubt i ever will, dont even think i want to. i also wouldn’t necessarily call myself “religious” and that’s the biggest reason why i took off the hijab recently; it almost felt disrespectful that i was presenting myself this way and even identifying this way when i hadn’t been praying in years and barely agreed with so much of the scripture/ideals. i value the base stuff and i think i always will, but i’ve been hurt too much and spent too much time in fear to ever really be able to reconcile with traditional organized religion, i think. i enjoy the religious things i grew up with on my own for the most part, and have never had very close muslim friends outside of childhood out of fear that they’ll find out who i really am and tell my mom and i’ll get disowned or something. i spent most of my adolescence alone, terrified, and convinced i was the only queer person of color ever. it’s nice finding other queer people, but most of the time queer spaces are overwhelmingly white, and it’s been exhausting being literally the only brown/black person in the room for most of my life. not to mention the hijab until recently. i went to a small pride event in a hijab once, it wasn’t a comfortable experience for me or anyone else there. they felt threatened, and i felt bad. i’m sort of in an in between, where i’m striving to be more free but also still feel the need to be reserved and modest. not to mention i still live with my parents. i’m scared that i’ll never feel “normal” or really fit in because i’m so behind compared to my peers :(. hoping to figure it all out one day 

and i can only imagine how much worse everything would’ve been if i’d grown up back in morocco/MENA. i joke about visiting and being thrown in jail somehow, but sadly that’s a real threat for hundreds of thousands of our people back home. so yeah just gonna focus on finding my other arab-americans for now lmao. 

(sorry for all the rambling, i got really excited that someone who could relate responded. i guess i’m asking for advice/searching for a little bit of hope?) 

on a more positive note, i’m glad you’ve been expanding your knowledge on our culture and i’m happy for you! i hope to get there too!! i agree that it’s incredibly rich and i love to learn about our history and the diversity of language and thought and how passionate we are as a people. inshallah the world will see that side of us more in the future."

i didnt go through anything as bad, but it still sucks. my dads black and my moms arab/north african. i think she’s grown to really dislike blackness because it isn’t what she thought it would be when she decided to marry my dad after knowing him for seven days and coming to the US, she just saw him as a cheap way to get The American Dream. she doesn’t like our hair, hates when we say n*gga to each other, and prefers when our skin is lighter. she insists on us not marrying black, she wants arab grandchildren, she wants them to “look like her.” she says pretty often that if she’d known what it’s like to be black in america, she wouldn’t have married a black man. she regrets it a lot and it’s more than obvious. i think she has good intentions and she’s saying that she would’ve wanted an easier life for her children, but it also just kinda feels like there’s a lot of resentment towards blackness. she insists that we’re ARAB, and i agree but also correct her and say that we’re BLACK as well, which she likes to ignore. i understand why she’s bitter because my father is pretty absent and hasn’t helped raise us at all, so all she knows is that the stereotype of inactive, lazy black fathers is true. she’s been done dirty and has typical biases. it’s just sad because i identify much more with my blackness than my arabness :(. i understand a decent amount of specifically moroccan arabic and barely speak it, and outside of my childhood, i haven’t spent much time around other arabs (my arab family is half way across the world, we have black family members right down the street). that side of my race seems to be solely secured by shared religious beliefs (we’re muslim) but i’m not even very religious so i feel less connected to it and i think it’s obvious to my mom. tbh, my mom WOULD have had an easier time if she’d just married arab. too bad we’re black. :("

AskReddit,fp0yjay,t3_gaepss,1588219858.0,"we’re self-deprecating, we’re addicted, and i think we care what people think about us in an entirely new way. it’s just your peers anymore, it’s random, unfiltered people from the internet. also, fake, performative, wokeness is EVERYWHERE. i know too many ppl who think they know shit but aren’t even remotely close to being class conscious. people just post shit on their story and act like it’s activism. nearly every single thing we do is performative. hoping more people learn to think for themselves. also, more are realizing through all of those memes and shit that they repost that the real problem is capitalism. hoping we grow up and change everything for the better. we’re ultimately fucked in way more brand new and much more catastrophic ways, and i think that demands a lot of radical change and hard work, and i think we can do it"
