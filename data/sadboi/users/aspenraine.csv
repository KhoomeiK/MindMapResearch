This past year i lost a lot of weight in a short period of time. I had to be hostiplized and treatment.  I still struggle everyday. I personally think you should tell your counsoler that you may have an eating disorter. Just so he knows, and is aware so he can help you. I know it may seem like you just cant because you want it to stay a secret. But people love you and dont want anything to happen to you. I do understand how you feel, I used to convense myself nobody loved me, but now I know it isn't true. If you ever need someone you can always talk to about anything I will be there for you. I send my good vibes to you. And I really truly hope you will recover and live a beautiful life because you deserve it."

This show I believe honestly changed me cause after I watched it in 6th it helped me get through some depression and I have loved Kaya in Everything, she is the celebrity I really want to meet. I was obsessed about moving to Bristol UK where skins was filmed. And like visit the places where they filmed. Evertime i watch the show now I get really suicidal and really anxious. I get flashbacks of times I would have mental breakdowns and to times I've tried to kill myself about 4 time plus some that nobody had found out about. That show I believe almost guided me into getting anorexia and bulimia with one of the main character cassie. I love the effy and that show I don't know if I will be able to watch the series again tho"
AskReddit,etfyu51,t3_cbbubt,1562780409.0,"I'm not a parent but I'm a daughter who was a bully in 3rd grade thru like 6th grade. I go to a small school, with only about 75 students in My grade. Everyone one know everyone else. My mom knew I was a bitch in 5th grade. She is a waitress at a restaurant in our town so she talks to a lot of people. I heard from her other students would talk her I was mean, because I was, I would call a lot of kids dushbags, I didn't even know what that was then. 
My mom would constantly tell me about what they would say and with all the trama I was put thru at home, and not having any real friends at the time. To most of my close friends i remember i would hit them if i got mad, or i would scratch them. I got super depressed and changed for the better, now I have multiple best friends and I'm not mean anymore. I'm so thankful my friends and I would do anything for them"
