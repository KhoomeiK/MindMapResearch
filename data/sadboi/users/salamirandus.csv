AskReddit,fkk2zrg,t3_fiueho,1584271386.0,"I bought a house in northwest Ohio that was about 120 years old. The basement was damp and creepy, some of it dirt. I found a box of old tiles and inside were letters addressed to the previous owner who had died recently and so did his wife. The letters were dated the early 60’s and from a woman in New York telling the owner, Denver Richardson, he had gotten her pregnant. Other letters would state how the baby was sick and how they had no money for milk and needed his help.  Most of the letters were her being desperate for food and medicine and seems like he just ignored her. It was sad."
