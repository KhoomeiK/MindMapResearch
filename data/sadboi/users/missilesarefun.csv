My advice is to just live life, happiness does not come from others or things but from within. I can look up at the sky in the morning and smile and am thankful to be alive and for what I have even if it's not much. You can rewire your brain and create new pathways and change your way of thinking, try it."

I understand mental illness is a bitch and most people are ignorant to it and don't understand. My only piece of advice is to push through and try all treatments available, everything from pshychiatic meds to Ketamine. If you do everything in your power and are still not getting better, well life sucks if all you do is suffer and well... but that is rarely a point anyone will reach if you fight to get better.
Good luck, don't lose hope, there are better days ahead, hopefully you will one day entertain Reddit with your heroic tail of overcoming mental illness."
