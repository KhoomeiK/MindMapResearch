TheLeftovers,ffirveq,t1_ffhj3k9,1579981154.0,"Your situation sounds very similar to mine. My wife tried watching the series when it first came out. She quit after 2 episodes saying what other have pointed out, too depressing, etc. A couple months ago, I was curious about all the buzz, especially after listening to some podcasts from the **Bald Move** guys who raved about it so I decided to watch. I power through the first few episodes really not ""getting it"" and saying so to my wife. Finishing episode 5, I told her, ""I think there is something here."" After episode 6, I said to her, ""if the series stays on this trajectory, it's going to be extraordinary (Holy Wayne/Nora scene). Then episodes by episode went by, the acting, writing and directing with scenes like Holy Wayne/Kevin, Matt and Kevin in the diner, Nora waking up to see her ""family"" came rushing at me. I was shaken from what I was experiencing.

Long story short, I finished season 3 and was going to rewatch to catch what I missed. I asked my wife to seriously consider joining me. I told her, ""The Leftovers is an experience unlike any other. I feel changed and deeply moved . . . it is art in its highest form."" She did and we wept. We were shaken and speechless. We're moved by the scenes many of you have described and seem to be universally experienced such as Nora crying in the hotel room in Australia with what seems like rivers of tears being released from her.

The Leftovers is an experience to go through and wonderful to share. It is rare to find something that can communicate on such a personal/human level sometimes using only images and expressions (the scene in Lens). 

Yes, the **Bald Move** guys are terrific. After listening to their Leftovers podcast, I signed up to become **Bald Move** member. These guys are knowledgeable, authentic, nerdy (in a complementary way) and funny. Good chemistry too. On one of their Westworld podcasts, A. Ron out of the blue asked Jim ""if he were at Westworld, would he 'do a prospector' just for the experience?""

My circumstance was a feedback loop one element connected to another, one element triggering another. Hope you can pull out of it before it consumes you. Hopefully you can act before things occur that you‚Äôll look back upon with regret"
depression,fbik8su,t3_ede9ga,1576903541.0,"Fwiw, Google the term ‚Äúpsychomotor retardation.‚Äù In layperson terms it‚Äôs what being described. The brain chemistry is such that getting out of bed, making the bed, showering, etc takes such efforts. For me, it felt like everything I was doing took so much effort, like I was always going uphill with thought and effort. At least when I understood the term, it didn‚Äôt cure things. More or less it helped keep a perspective when I‚Äôm experiencing this - it‚Äôs something happening to me vs me being extra defective, a part of me, etc. 

How this makes sense and maybe even helps a bit."
OaklandAthletics,fbickdk,t1_fbff60c,1576897100.0,"Yep. Saw same thing. I don‚Äôt blame him for thinking like this. Feels like the A‚Äôs have had a horrible history of pitchers getting hurt. Puk, Luzardo, Manea are all coming off injuries. Their main pitching prospects in the minors are also coming off T.J. surgeries or major shoulder issues. 

To answer the main question, I‚Äôd let it play out."
TheLeftovers,fbic8g5,t1_fbhygmf,1576896826.0,"Doing the same thing . . . Rewatching Leftovers while trying to take in Watchmen. I like Watchmen and I know it‚Äôs totally different than The Leftovers. However, it‚Äôs hard to judge Watchmen while I‚Äôm still digesting The Leftovers. Feels unfair to Watchmen but I‚Äôm a little underwhelmed. Visually stunning but not the same extraordinary emotional journey as The Leftovers. Shame on me for not spacing things out."
TheLeftovers,fbhy7by,t3_edgd4b,1576885489.0,"The show took my breath away, the performances, writing, directing, etc. I am watching it again as I too missed many of the details in season 1 that circled back around in season 3. 

I also have some issues with certain elements within the show but I think it‚Äôs a sign of its impact and emotional punch (maybe it‚Äôs human nature to nick pick at something that is elevated art). 

Watching it is an experience. I found it transformative."

TheLeftovers,fb5m2rx,t3_ebgpnk,1576530123.0,"FWIW, I was in your shoes. My wife quit watching after 2 shows when it initially came out. I was half way in season 1 and read all the accolades but I just didn‚Äôt get it. I had the reaction you had but I decided to march ahead . . . I am so grateful I did. I finished all 3 seasons and was going to rewatch but talked my wife into rewatching. We‚Äôre half way through season 2

The show is extraordinary. Granted, the subject matter is not for everyone so I get the initial response but this show is about so much more. There are many powerful moments that transcend description. I feel changed, touched and profoundly moved after watching The Leftovers. 

I would suggest at least finishing season 1 and then decide if you wish to continue. My sense is you‚Äôll know after completing season 1. There are a few scenes that lie ahead that the acting elevates the scenes into emotional art. Also in rewatching I notice several ‚Äúclues‚Äù that circle back in season 3 and the finale. Good luck and keep me posted."

TheLeftovers,faq6fig,t1_faiap6n,1576298576.0,Finally got my wife to watch. She initially quit after 2 shows in season 1. I watched all 3 seasons and now am watching again. I understand the first reaction some have to the show. I did too but persisted.  Am glad I did. The show is art at such a high level and I feel internally moved in such a profound way. It‚Äôs unlike anything I can recall experiencing.
