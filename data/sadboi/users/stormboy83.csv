As to each Govt., it's tough to take drastic decisions and then look like a fool. They base decisions on data, and that takes time. It's reactionary, and that always increases the risk. Data coming from China wasn't trusted.

Regarding the virus itself, it's worse than the common flu. There's no vaccine. I'm a middle aged adult with no kids so I don't worry about it myself. But my parents and my nephews are probably gonna catch it if it spreads, and the %'s are much worse than a flu in those age brackets. 

More so if they can't access top healthcare, because it's gotten out of control and hospitals are full.

The sad part, is that we can stop it! Everyone goes out only in need and we stop mass gatherings, until there is a vaccine.

The problem is no politician will put a freeze on the economy on purpose. It's a death sentence for them. Still the economy has frozen and will be worse.

Taking a drastic decision early might attempt against our democracy or personal freedom, but it may have been the best choice.

Just go home and read 20 books in 2 weeks. Measures should have been taken to control this until a vaccine is out."
