Anxiety,flnrsow,t3_fpj3oc,1585324642.0,"I often wake up having attacks as well. They'll usually begin with a hypnic jerk and feeling out of breath. I tend to convince myself I've somehow stopped breathing during sleep. Like my brain forgets to breathe? When it first started happening I would have full body attacks where my arms and hands would stiffen and almost seize up. I've been to emerge so many times and nothing ever appears wrong. I even convinced myself I had sleep apnea, had a sleep test, no sign of apnea. I'm a 26 year old apparently healthy female and I still have difficulty believing that when I have these symptoms.

I think the important thing to realize is that there are so many of us experiencing anxiety, and it can manifest in such bizarre ways. Finding what works for you in that moment is the best advice I can give. For me it used to be going to the hospital, now I try my best to reassure myself that I've been through this before and that eventually it does pass."

OCD,fapxn9s,t1_fapwsd7,1576294905.0,"Exactly! It’s like once you start picking and see more imperfections or pieces of skin rather, you feel the need to keep picking them off until it looks “clean”. 

But thank you, I’ve been trying very hard to understand myself and what causes such a strange “habit”. I have other obvious symptoms of OCD but have never been properly diagnosed and continue to just research/cope myself."
OCD,fapex78,t3_eabl0z,1576286871.0,"I do the exact same thing, often until they bleed. I'll try to pick my entire cuticle off and I'll honestly think that the more I pick, the ""better"" I can make it look.  Sometimes I'll even squeeze my finger until the bloods pouring out and then eat it (weird I know). I've suffered from this for years, but I do remember a period of time where I didn't do it.

I would say to maybe pay attention to what's going on at the time you are picking, are you worried about something? If you can become aware of any triggers that cause you to do so, you can try to work to avoid them. I've yet to be diagnosed with OCD but I'm certain that I have it, I believe the two are definitely intertwined and that skin picking could be considered a compulsion."

OCD,f3u4oms,t1_f3u3ea4,1571152853.0,"I realize how that may have sounded and totally agree with you. Obviously I don’t mean to feed into those thoughts. Reassuring that they are only thoughts and that yes you will always be there for them is what l should have said. My boyfriend doesn’t ignore me when I am having these thoughts, or say a panic attack. But him telling me that I’m not having a heart attack and that I don’t need to go to the hospital allows me a shot at using my brain logically and knowing that I’ve gone through this countless times.

I also realize that I didn’t really give any advice on how to cope. I got a tad emotional with that posters comment.

I myself am still only learning about my OCD. I am medicated for my anxiety but find that it doesn’t at all help with the former. Not having access or being able to afford therapy is an unfortunate reality for most. My doctor offers 5-6 free sessions of counselling, and I agree that it was helpful being able to talk openly to an unbiased professional.

Without having access to either of those things, I would recommend encouraging her to talk about her thoughts and feelings as much as possible. I’ve found that being able to tell my boyfriend about my odd intrusive thoughts helps me to understand that that’s exactly what they are and that they aren’t a part of me. Trying alternative methods like meditation as you said is proven to be helpful. There are countless books, and YouTube channels like this poster mentioned that could help both of you gain a better understanding of the ins and outs of OCD and other possible coping methods."
OCD,f3tvzg0,t1_f3tu8rc,1571147442.0,"This is literally your OCD telling you that you are not good enough to be loved. If you truly love your significant other and vice versa, they will love you no matter what, ups and downs. 

There are times when it may be very difficult for your partner to comprehend the way your brain operates, but that doesn’t mean they can’t love you. And there are times when you should both be able to laugh it off because logically you understand that this is your OCD and not you. 

I’m sorry you feel this way but people with OCD most definitely can love and be loved and maybe not every partner will be able to cope and understand but I can assure you that there will always be someone for everyone. 

OP, understand that OCD can be a very tricky illness to comprehend. It can seem very silly to others when we verbalize our thoughts, crazy even. But remember that this is not your girlfriend and that she truly can’t help it. The best that you can do is give her that constant reassurance, it’s usually what’s needed most. Remind her that this is her brain, and that if she tries to think about it logically, she can look at the thought or experience from outside of her OCD and gain reassurance from that as well.

I suffer from OCD. I have been in many relationships. I’ve been called crazy, psycho, you name it. It doesn’t mean that I can’t be loved/love another. I have finally found someone who loves me for who I am and does his best to understand the way my brain operates, even if that means constantly reassuring me that the dinner he just made is cooked thoroughly, lol."
Anxiety,f3tul1j,t3_dhszpb,1571146476.0,This might be a bit of an overshare but I used to get such bad anxiety that I smelled bad after using the washroom. I would be out at the bar or wherever and I would have to ask my friends if I smelt like you know what because I would be so convinced that I didn’t clean up properly lol. I know that I am an extremely hygienic person and would always be reassured by friends but I would see someone look at me and be convinced that they could smell me. Anxiety is weird as fuck.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,ep5y9jh,t3_btx5l0,1559062350.0,"Going to attempt to make a long story short here, as a teenager I smoked heavily and for a number of years. It got to the point where it began giving me severe panic attacks and I had to quit. Since then, I've experienced ongoing anxiety and occasional panic attacks. Now I understand that many drugs, weed especially, can bring forward underlying mental illnesses. Smoking weed obviously doesn't cause mental illnesses, there are a multitude of factors within one's life that can generate the need for our mind/body's to cope.

In my case, depression/anxiety was always there, even since childhood. I just never really had words for it. But I do believe that early drug experimentation and smoking heavily brought on the panic attacks.

After a few years I started smoking again, no panic attacks, and I am still smoking. Though I frequently experience depersonalization (not directly from smoking, usually at random times), and still suffer from anxiety. Without getting too personal, I believe my mental illnesses are a direct cause from uncontrollable experiences that have happened throughout my life.

Moving forward, this is where things take a little turn. I too have experienced everything you've just described. Though I like to think of some of these things as synchronicity. A way of seeing the universe speak through unexplainable phenomena?

Just as I read this post I experienced an intense deja vu feeling, especially as I read the comments. Now refer to the top comment in this post, ""welcome to the simulation"".
