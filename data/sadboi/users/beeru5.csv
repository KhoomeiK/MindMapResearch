bapcsalescanada,fb8h6qo,t3_e97esw,1576613874.0,"Good keyboard it's currently the one I'm using(2 years), it's all plastic but it's tough plastic so little flex. Removable plug is always a plus, comes with a keycap puller as well & there's nothing else to it really. I currently have cherry mx browns, now when it comes to typing experience I don't really know if this applies for most keyboards or if it's just this particular one as this is the third kind of keyboard I've owned, but there are times where typing experience feels really rough and other times feel really good, I don't know if I actually have to do some maintenance(takes up too much time, gotta resolder to lube it) to keep the feeling consistent. Otherwise I think this is a good keeb, I ordered it through massdrop at the time I think I got for $90\~ CAD but y'know how massdrop already is, the shipping takes forever."
