I think what your looking for is the gentleman that gives you the Rotom Magazine, a Key Item for Rotom to ‚Äúswap forms‚Äù with. :)

The gentleman is in one of the house in Wyndon. He has the appearance of League Staff. His Pok√©mon I believe is around 36~40 give or take.

Once you beat him in battle, he will give you the item.

Other than that, the Rotom Bike is just that; Rotom Bike. Can‚Äôt use it in battle but to zoom around. You get floaties/floating tires upgrade for it after beating Opal who I think is the fifth gym.

You can after get more Rotoms in the Lake of Outrage during thunder weather I believe.

depression,f7w75m8,t1_f7vhm6c,1574030544.0,"In a way it‚Äôs farming for drops. But you know exactly what your getting and the percentile rate. 

There is Botanist Class and Miner Class.

Botany Class is where you harvest/gather things such as Maple Sap for the Crafting Class use (which in this case is Culinary. Culinary ‚Äúcooks‚Äù the Maple Sap into either Maple Syrup or Maple Sugar). Botany also gathers lumbars of wood for Carpenter Crafting Class.

Miners is where you gather things like Ores and Minerals. Miners best work with Alchemy Class and Goldsmithing. 

For both Gather Classes, they can share Equipment and use similar skills! They also have a means of ‚Äúsneak‚Äù now built in so you can ‚Äúgather‚Äù in peace and don‚Äôt need to worry about monsters kicking your ass while doing so. Gathering Classes work great with the crafting classes! 

They have also made it a lot easier and simpler to gather if your pressed for time with ‚ÄúAuto-Gather‚Äù meaning you can click that little box and it‚Äôll gather as much as it can for the node (usually 4-5 a node). It also is more often that not a success! :)

The little pop up window that says what you can gather, if you are able to gather more than 1, the percent of the success rate of gathering the item and the chance of it being higher quality.

It can get a little mind numbing but I don‚Äôt mind. I throw on some jazz or something and do the gathering.

Square has a trial for free up to level 30. You won‚Äôt be able to make an Au Ra (kinda dragon like), Viera (rabbit), or Hrothgar (lion) races. You also won‚Äôt be able to off the bat make the following classes:

-Dark Knight (HW)
-Astrologer (HW)
-Samurai (SB)
-Dancer (ShB)
-Gunblade (ShB)
-Red Mage (SB)

You would need the expansions for them.

HW = Heavensward
SB = Stormblood
ShB = Shadowbringers

I will openly admit that ARR is a hot mess of fetch quests. I wouldn‚Äôt ever openly put my worse enemy through that slog of quests. I would recommend if you get interested to stick through it and not skip with the jump potions.

As long as it is, the story is worth the build up to Heavensward at the very least and going through the dungeons will teach the required mechanics for each boss fight that will be seen again in later dungeons.

Shadowbringers in my opinion is one of their best tales that I loved along with Heavensward. One of the anti heroes in Shadowbringers I believe is deeply depressed in their own way and I couldn‚Äôt help but connect with em.

Sorry for the long post and ramble.

The only thing right now that makes me feel something is doing random crafting and gathering in Final Fantasy 14. It kinda makes me feel calm and it‚Äôs mind numbing enough to clear the ‚Äústatic‚Äù I hear in my head all day.
