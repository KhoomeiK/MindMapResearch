If she can't then you just have to block her. I completely understand being worried about her and not wanting to hurt her, but you're not the reason that she's in pain and it's not fair of her to expect you to be there to support her after she dumped you.

If you think you might just need a week to think about things and then decide how to go from there, then take that week off. Tell her and if she's still texting you every day then block her.

You're not obligated to take away her pain and it's possible that by trying you're just going to hurt yourself and her even more.

idk what to make of the person you texted. it sounds like they might care about you but the other stuff you say about them seems red flag-y. i obviously don't know either of you or the situation but it sounds like you really need some support in your life right now. if you think this person can provide that for you in a healthy way then go for it.

it kind of worries me that you think they're going to abuse you or make fun of you. if you really think thats going to happen, or that this is a toxic person, then id really recommend not seeing them. if instead its just that little voice in the back of your head convincing you that you deserve abuse and so it's going to happen, try really hard to silence it. because youre not used up, youre not unworthy, and you deserve more than to be used. youve been dealt a really really shitty hand with bpd but it doesnt define you or make you any less than deserving of love and kindness than anybody else. are you in therapy?

All that does is make things worse! If they weren't going to be annoyed by what you said, then bringing up and stating that you ARE annoying them is only going to make them look at the conversation through that lens. If people are irritated, or think they need an apology from you for dumping shit on them *wait for them to ask!*. You are sabotaging yourself if you IMMEDIATELY start every conversation defensively. And these ARE all defensive statements.

 By saying you're probably making things worse, you're assuming things about the listener. Then they're in a place where they have to apologize or reassure you over things that *they did nothing to imply*.

With that being said, fuck yes I did this all the time. It was annoying and my therapist and dbt group hammered it into me to *stop doing this* and that it's only making my interpersonal communication worse. Reading it now it reads as so so manipulative and fishing for validation. I know that's not why you say it! I didn't, I genuinely thought my feelings were stupid and that everybody who listened to me was so so kind and selfless for doing so, that I was a burden. 

But you're not! Friends help friends. Friends listen to friends. Friends don't need apologies for being friendly. And if they do, if you genuinely are too much one time, then the apology you should/will make will be so watered down in their eyes because you apologize every time."

Inpatient isn't for long term treatment. It's for keeping you safe for a few days until they don't think you're going to immediately go home and try to kill yourself again. They are going to try to get you on meds and try to set you up with a long term treatment plan with a therapist and a psychiatrist. Cooperate fully, work with them, explain any concerns you have about the medication and just try to be engaged with the staff.

Just try to relax, and don't worry about the future or the past. Don't push to get out. Don't spend all day crying and being miserable. As long as you're distressed they're going to just continue to keep you. To leave you have to show them that you're okay, even if just for now.

Be proud of yourself, be brave, this is the first step to recovery. Try and be friendly with the other people there, talk to the nurses, ask them how they're doing, and try to appreciate the structure that an inpatient stay provides. Yeah having a set schedule can suck in some ways, but for me it was kind of nice knowing everything I was going to do today. 

Group therapy was boring and dumb to me, but depending on how symptomatic you are it might be really helpful. On days when I thought it was pointless I tried to pay extra attention to the people who were not doing as well as I was with handling everything, and it made me happy to see them learning skills and discovering things about themselves they didn't know.

oh boy have I heard this before :) 

> he’s in my dreams almost every night and I get such anxiety thinking over and over it

it makes you just never want to sleep again, doesnt it.

but i'll say this, stop trying to fix things. sometimes things just can't be fixed. there's no clearing the air here. 

ask yourself what you want out of meeting up with him? do you just want to apologize? do you want to be forgiven? think about what he's done so far, he doesn't want you in his life. trying to reinsert yourself even for something like clearing the air or apologizing is what *you* want, and it's selfish. im sorry, i know that sucks to hear/realize.

i so badly want to try to get in touch with my ex and apologize for how shitty i was during the years we were together, but what good does that do her? she doesnt want to talk to me. she's moved on and she's happy and she's living her best life. all a text from me would do is bring up old wounds for her. all an apology would do is remind her of why im apologizing. ive decided that im never going to reach out to her. it's selfish and it'd be for me, not her. it'd be so i could look at myself and say ""you apologized! youre good :)"". but i dont need to subject her to me to forgive myself.

as for getting over the embarrassment and guilt, you just have to commit to not making those mistakes again. you'll fail eventually, here and there. but every night you get drunk and sad and dont go calling all of your friends or your ex's is a victory. it takes time. it takes distress tolerance skills. i struggle with the embarrassment a lot. i just try to focus on right now rather than the past. it sucks and its not easy but you cant change the past, you can only change the present.

AmItheAsshole,fgg7r86,t3_ey3jxn,1580756073.0,esh. leave her. you dont trust her (with good reason probably). why do you want to spend your life with somebody you dont trust
nba,fg5w44v,t3_ex0dbv,1580541349.0,"The only thing I don't like about this is pretending that this wasn't what he wrote down. LeBron had 5 days to write a speech, he did, he memorized 75%+ of it, and then said ""naw u know what? I'm not reading what I wrote...kobe deserves more"" and then just gave the same speech he wrote, maybe not word for word but the gist was the same. This is easily my least favorite speech trope. There's no shame in reading off what you wrote. There's no shame in memorizing it and doing it without staying glued to your notes. But God I fucking hate when people go ""I WrOtE a WhOle SpEeCh BuT iM nOt GoNnA dO iT"" and then they do a clearly rehearsed speech.

It was beautiful and respectful and I loved the speech, I just hate the showmanship. Just fucking deliver a speech don't make a big deal about how good of a speaker you are off the (not actual) dome."
nba,fg5v3g6,t3_ex1zap,1580540096.0,"this loss is embarrassing. Absolutely no reason for the Lakers to lose on home court tonight of all nights, against the blazers of all teams. Whiteside went fucking off and there is no excuse for the Lakers front court not shutting their 1 man paint presence down tonight. Dame's gonna Dame but Jesus Christ Whiteside should not be crushing us down low like this.


Kuz and rondo continue to let the team down. Get them out of here. Not a single reason LAL should've lost this game and the only thing I hope is that LeBron carries this chip on his shoulder through the rest of the season."
AmItheAsshole,fg56b6z,t3_ewr7sh,1580519350.0,nta. how about suggesting you'll pay for his next degree when he pays you back for the first one lmao.

AmItheAsshole,ffueo02,t3_euyevt,1580240368.0,i got through 2.5 paragraphs of this nonsense. yta. stay out of your brothers marriage.

BPD,ffdit6n,t3_esxdyb,1579821768.0,"i get so so so much more pissed at myself when its a dumb small thing that starts the breakdown. big things, like getting dumped or pet dying or big unexpected bill i can forgive myself for melting down over in time. but fuck, dumb shit like burning my rice or misplacing my dental flossers can turn me into a mess out of nowhere. i hate it. 

i dont have a lot of advice. i try to just be mindful of whats going on and how little this inconvenience will matter in a few hours, or tomorrow, or next week or whatever. if im at home i try to do the dive response thing where you put your face in a bowl of ice cold water for a few seconds and that has been literally life changing in terms of preventing things from escalating or stopping them altogether.

hope things get easier for you. im on here all the time if you ever need somebody to vent to or just bullshit around"
BPD,ffcx7xb,t1_ffcvoef,1579809152.0,">i try to avoid thinking about it and if i start to feel sad i don’t let myself 

yeah, in DBT they said this wasn't a good coping mechanism, that you have to feel your grief and acknowledge it and let it pass, but i dont get it because that just doesnt work for me. i feel it and acknowledge it but then it doesnt go away. so i dont know what else to do except just try to push it down any time it comes up. ugh. it so frustrating. if you're able to feel your feelings without them consuming your head and lingering i'd recommend trying it if you havent. it didnt work for me but who knows maybe itll help you

and yw. you hang in there too."
AmItheAsshole,ffcruvj,t3_esjhx2,1579805971.0,this is disgusting. yta. and you should be absolutely ashamed of yourself.
AmItheAsshole,ffabflg,t3_es07dv,1579731617.0,"yta. oh god i think im going to throw up. asking about an interview was cool, not an ah for that at all. asking to go to an art show to ""talk about her career"" is definitely weird but i guess i could see it being an honest mistake. texting her after her boss asks you to leave her alone is 100% way over the line and super super weird and creepy dude."
AmItheAsshole,ffa9iy7,t1_ff7azsr,1579730519.0,wow. im so sorry that sucks. this is heartbreaking and kills any hope i had left of making friends in the city i moved to almost a year ago and have made 0 friends at.
BPD,ff9y1bd,t1_ff9xajh,1579723965.0,"jesus. yeah i agree with what theyre saying, but there was definitely no need to be such an asshole about it. 

i don't think you should let your employer know, all it can do is hurt you honestly. when i was in DBT i told my employer i was getting treated for mental health and needed my schedule changed, that's it. they have no right to your medical information, be as open as you want to be about it, but just keep in mind the worst case scenarios that could come from telling them. (they/a friend of theirs dated a person with bpd who was crazy and abusive and manipulative and they think less of you now, or they have no idea what it is and google it and read all the shitty things people write about it and think less of you). i wouldn't recommend it at all tbh"
