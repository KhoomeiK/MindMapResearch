depression,fq9st1f,t3_ghdi7l,1589206317.0,"I get that. I purposefully avoid people like that coz i feel I'll never be able to relate to them lol. But ultimately, I guess I'm just jealous. I wanna know what that feels like."
gaymers,fpvjjub,t1_fpuhweq,1588946075.0,Xenoblade looks interesting! I tried the demo for  Octopath but first 30 mins felt a bit bland to me. Which is weird as I'm usually a big fan of old school jrpgs. Is it worth another try? Lol
depression,forkq0e,t3_g7yfmm,1588013864.0,"Yeah. It feels pointless most of the time but really, what else is there to do? Might as well find enjoyment in all the pointless things we do everyday ðŸ˜„"
MentalHealthPH,fctqjjq,t3_ehwvbc,1577954345.0,"I can relate to a lot of things you're going through. But of course I can never fully understand how it feels until I'm in the exact same situation and mindset as you. But for someone who knows how hopeless life can seem like, I pray that you can manage to stay strong and brave this through. I hope you love the people around you enough to survive this for them. I don't recall a time where I don't think of dying but a good friend told me once na if I do it, pinapasa ko lang sa iba ung nararamdaman ko. At wala ako sa tabi nila to help them process that. We might not have the people we want in our lives but there are still people that need us in theirs. Kahit un na lang muna siguro. We can hold on to that a little longer. I wish this year will be so much better for you :)"
MentalHealthPH,fctpvzd,t3_eihjc1,1577953429.0,"I feel you. I have the same thing going on. 2019 has been harsh to me. Buti tapos na. Haha. Pero for the past few months, I'm averaging 2-4 hours of sleep a day. Super unusual for me since mantika ako matulog. Di ako nagigising sa kahit ano na alarm. Pero lately nauuna pa ko sa alarm ko ng around 2-3 hours. And same with you, sobrang tense ko agad and I get an overwhelming sadness when I wake up. I'm planning to see a professional to help me with this and I suggest you do the same. Sabi mo nga, let's all be kind to ourselves this new year :) Good luck!"
MentalHealthPH,fctpmuz,t3_eijouq,1577953080.0,"I think it's partly why I smoke and drink a lot. Lol.  I mean if anything happens because of that I know it's something I've indirectly done to myself. Pero I guess, don't think I'd want to put an immediate and definite end to everything because I'm still kinda hopeful that things might get better eventually? And if I kill myself now and miss out on that it's something worse I did to myself? Also, I'm super scared I might fail. Haha. And be in a worse situation than I am currently in. It would be easier for me to accept death if it was out of my control. I don't really know. Maybe I haven't run out of excuses not to do it yet. Lol."
depression,fax6aoq,t3_eaqn2p,1576379351.0,"It is. Unfortunately I am also not able to do the things needed to take care of that ""problem"" :("
depression,f5vie2i,t3_dpgj0w,1572490062.0,"I can totally relate to this. Mostly due to my anxiety. I just can't stand waiting to see how things turn out. Lol. I take it as a good sign though that maybe I feel things will get better eventually. That I haven't lost ALL hope though it feels that way sometimes. But yeah, maybe we can try making the most of the present. Coz we're not Dr. Strange, we're stuck with the natural flow of time."
depression,f5vhuwn,t3_dpgk6k,1572489704.0,I do
MentalHealthPH,f5vhe24,t1_f5sz2q6,1572489382.0,Doc said i don't seem depressed naman but i struggle with anxiety issues
depression,f5s0omx,t1_f5s09lc,1572407915.0,Thank you! I hope things get better too. I understand that I need to get rid of unhelpful people but I just can't shake the thought of it could just be me that's the problem. If I weren't like this we could just be okay. But yeah i get it. Maybe I'm just scared of the things to come. If i do or do not break up. Lol. Life is hard
depression,f5s0cwl,t1_f5rzcfs,1572407630.0,"Hmm. Maybe I wasn't super clear about how he treats me. He doesn't say insults like that. He actually encourages me to take care of myself more. It's more of making me feel like I'm at fault for my issues. When I feel anxious, I'm choosing to feel anxious. When I feel sad, I chose that too. I've been blaming myself a lot lately for things that go wrong. I know that's partly true because I can think of the craziest shit that hasn't happened or will not happen ever. But I've never been dishonest about these. I tell everyone important to me about the things I go through. I don't expect them to understand. But is it wrong to expect a little compassion I guess? He tells me sometimes he's fed up. I ask if he needs space, tells me he doesn't. But does nothing about the things that bother me. I feel sometimes he's just leading me on for god knows why. I just want to feel loved I guess, despite everything. I tell him that. But he doesn't really care. Feeling like it's just my mind making stuff up. How much of it is my fault? And how much of it is coming from others? I just wanna know so I don't hate myself as much. I feel like I've ruined every good thing in my life."
depression,f5rz4ht,t3_dp1260,1572406639.0,"I feel you. My mind tells me that all the time too. I should be sleeping but I'm here on reddit reading about other people's lives just to assure me I'm not alone. And that also means you are not ðŸ¤—. Surprisingly, it does help. Lol. Doesn't make things any better for sure but knowing that people are fighting through it and surviving helps. Thanks for sharing your story."
depression,f5ryhyd,t3_dp19ec,1572406166.0,"Today is over :) Tomorrow you get a 50/50 chance of a better day. If it doesn't go well, just like today it will be over and you get another chance the next day. And I think that's a good reason to look foward to tomorrow. Hang in there!"
CasualConversation,f5khvm4,t1_f5k5zsy,1572263703.0,"If you'd be genuinely into it, why not? It could be something you both share. But i think it's enough to show him you sincerely appreciate his stuff"
CasualConversation,f5k2h5n,t3_do5ykj,1572253054.0,Maybe you can focus on something specific like the beat or the lyrics etc. and try to ask about the process of creating it. I think that way you can make him feel you're super into and also learn more about music along the way
CasualConversation,f5k1ird,t3_do60hf,1572251904.0,I started getting in relationships young and may have said those words too often than necessary. But it's always nice to hear it from someone really special and know that they mean it. Happy for you!
Anxiety,f5jy678,t3_do32ho,1572246596.0,"Happens to me all the time. Everytime I feel like I'm falling asleep I get anxious of losing that and then I'm back to square one. Lol. I've been up for close to 24 hours now as I type this. If you figure it out, let me know :p"
Anxiety,f5jxrkm,t3_dnzfv7,1572245990.0,I feel you. I've had days where I just need to let out so much but I have no one. Or no one who will understand at least. I'm here to talk if you need to.
Anxiety,f5jnpfw,t3_do32o2,1572233849.0,"I just tell them how I feel, things I worry about.. I try not to be too serious and dramatic about it. I'd often say it in a joking way. Partly coz i know most of the things I worry about only exists in my mind (which does not make anything any better, to be clear) and also because I know they'd never really understand how I feel. I mostly tell other people just to let off a little steam. It helps sometimes. To tell people you're not okay. They may or may not care. But at least I don't have to worry about how to respond when somebody finally notices and asks how I am LOL. At the end of the day i think it's really just us who's gonna help ourselves. And we do what we can to survive"
