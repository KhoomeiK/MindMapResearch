MentalHealthSupport,fqk7gt4,t3_gjcikj,1589421614.0,"in 2017 my wife told me we were pregnant with our 3rd child around mid-June, a week or two before my birthday.  I'd been off my meds for 3 months because we'd been trying to 6 months with no joy.  Stopped on March 5th, pregnant around June 5th. 

Around the beginning of July, she got some pains and we had to go for a scan at a local hospital.  Yes, we're definitely pregnant, but the sack looked like a teardrop, it was too small to see anything. We had to wait and go back 2 weeks later. When we went back it was black in the scan where it was white before. They told us we'd lost it. My wife asked about the pain she was still getting in her ovary area but we were told not to worry, that was normal and we came home. 

2 weeks later I had a phone call while at work. My wife had blacked out and an ambulance was coming to her.  get to the hospital now. it was only 15 mins from work, don't remember getting there but I remember sitting in my car crying in the car park, unable to find a space and my mother in law had just told me, ""we've not left yet, they are trying to stabilise her!""

The longest day of my life. Turns out, we'd had twins. One had got stuck in the tube and the other must-have torn away, hence the odd shape. Well, the one that had remained had carried on growing until it ruptured the tube.  She was rushed into surgery at around 6 pm, I met her in a ward at around 10:30 pm.  

Like you, they'd removed 2.5 litres of blood from her and gave her several units during the operation with several more over the next 2 days. Before she went into surgery, I had to hear her say ""if anything happens to me, give the kids a good life!"", I have been suicidal before and nearly went through with it but nothing compares to that sadness for me.  We're 39 and have been together since just before we turned 16. I don't think either of us could really cope without the other.

Luckily she didn't have the complications that you had, but, for the first time, she started to understand the mental health issues I've been plagued with for 20 years.  She developed all kinds of anxiety linked to lots of weird things, I remember her crying when we left the hospital, she didn't really know why, just full of emotions, joy, fear... 

We got pregnant again fairly quickly, about 2 months, and we lost her early on as well but, we hadn't gotten our hopes up this time, we hadn't talked names or anything so, as horrid as it sounds, it didn't really affect us that much. 

Our third child was born on Dec 21st last year, a little boy called Obie.  We still think of the twins, who jokingly I had called Wade Wilson before we even knew it was twins, I give all the bumps stupid names :)  Just 3 weeks ago a piece of music came on the TV and from nowhere I broke down, it sounded like music I'd used on another video I'd made about the loss and to announce Obie's pregnancy.  Our friend's niece had twins early January and that upset my wife. Having Obie has really helped though, he's such a chilled smiley baby and there is so much love towards him in the house. 

I see a lot of similarities in what you've written to what we, and especially my wife dealt with. I believe that, over the coming months, all those bad memories will fade, they may pop up now and then and give you a slap but it'll all seem worth it each time you look at your baby.

I've a lot of childhood trauma that still effects me, but I think that's because it's just a negative experience. In your case, ultimately it was a positive. You have an amazing little life that came from all that, so although it was bad, it ended in a win, and the first smiles, rollovers, hugs, I love you's all make that trauma seem worth it. 

Even when my depression was at it's worst, having a hug from one of the kids, that unconditional love you feel, gave me an oasis of peace and I truly believe if it wasn't for moments like that, I wouldn't be here today."

However, the abuse itself isn't a symptom, but it can be the result of a symptom.  Feeling unworthy, having low self-esteem etc can cause people to act out, some will end relationships prematurely as they don't feel worthy, some will try to control the person going out so they don't meet someone better and they end up alone. 

it's like self harm, one of my ways of self-harming is overeating. I can browse cupboards, eat food and feel rough because of it despite not being hungry in the slightest to start with.

Now, I agree that it's abuse, it's emotional abuse I suffered with from my parents during their divorce, and I agree it's wrong and we shouldn't say it's ok under any circumstances but to say it's not due to having BPD I feel only creates more stress, self-doubt and self-hatred on the abuser which in turn fuels the behaviour because they feel less worthy of their partner.

Instead, you need to understand the BPD symptoms that cause this behaviour. For me, it was insecurity, a lack of self-worth and probably other symptoms too that caused me to jealous, trying to control if my wife went out drinking/partying etc. I was a fucking vile person in my younger years looking back but luckliy my wife was and is a strong person. 

Being diagnosed with BPD allowed me to start linking that stupid behaviour with clear symptoms of having BPD.  It allowed my wife and I to understand why I behaved in certain ways at certain times.  Although I've not had therapy this new knowledge has allowed us both to develop coping mechanisms that mean I can deal with things much better than before. Stuff still bothers me but I handle it much better.  

My wife means the world to me, and I am constantly petrified of losing her, anxiety can set in easily but instead of hating myself for being jealous, controlling and screwed up and I accept it's in me, but it isn't me, I  can cope with it, I can control it."

I have a biggish one on my torso where the hair doesn't grow and 3 brownish thin ones that my 5-year-old noticed this morning. those 3 were done just before the day I killed myself.  I actually use my scars to stop me from cutting again when the need comes, which is often.  

I look at them and think of the tiny but of relief that it gave at the time, then the weeks of shame trying to hide it from my wife and kids afterwards, then the embarrassment and guilt for having to lie about how I got them when they do see them.  My wife is aware of my behaviour, but I don't want my kids knowing.

At 9 my mother left my father, she blamed him but she was screwing the bloke over the road. 

She then fell pregnant with his baby, and when he found out it was a boy he never came back.

She then met another bloke when I was 13/14, by this point I was sleeping on our lounge floor as we didn't have the room, in fact, I don't think I slept in a proper bed from age 12 to age 16, and he knocked her up.  She had a little boy again who was born a few months before I started dating my wife, I was 15.  I had a few months of living with them in a 3 bedroom house before moving out to take care of my grandmother.

I'd been the man of the house since I was 10, mowing 1 acre of lawns every week, making coal fires to keep us warm, fetching logs from the local wood, started a gardening business at 14 to help feed us. I remember my mum taking us away to a family caravan in Wales when I was 13, some bloke came banging on the door around 1 am and then tried grabbing her through the window. So I had to calm her down and sit with a meat knife all night to protect my family in case he came back. We left the next day.

I was dealing with being bullied because it was known my dad tried to kill himself, to having old crappy hand me down clothes, no money, I was dealing with my dad's emotional abuse, and his constant attempts at taking his own life. My mother constantly saying what a screw up my dad was, a waste of skin, and you can tell you're a ""dad's surname"" you're just like him.

I think for many people, it's actually less scary and easier when you have a diagnosis, it means you're not just a screw-up and there is no hope. BPD isn't your fault, it can make us do stupid things but once you know what's wrong, you can develop ways of dealing with it. You can recognise patterns and behaviour and take steps to mitigate them. So having a BPD diagnosis could make your relationship more likely to survive. 

Yes, tell your boyfriend about it, talk about it your fears, then include him in researching it, learm about it together, he needs to know how to thelp and how to deal with it as well. 

Don't think that having bpd stops you having a relationship.  I got with my wife just before we turned 16, we're 39 this year and been married around 11 years, 3 kids and a mortgage. Yes we've been through the crap together, and only having had a BPD diagnosis for 4-5 years has made it easier.

Now, Stewart was a white 6ft 4inch south African and liked to tell people about how rough it was, how tough he was, and how you had to carry a gun there. In the UK we don't have guns, this was his initial method of trying to intimidate people.

He would test people's knowledge of gambling by asking roulette questions, a product we didn't have and 98% of all chat was bingo-based. So pointless.  He'd then belittle you for now knowing. 

He once told us to go to another bingo site and ask lots of awkward questions due to a change they had made, say how bad the new layout was, etc. Unfortunately for him, our CEO knew their CEO, who gave him a bell and asked what the hell was going on.

We had really bad snow one evening so I sent all but 3 staff members home around 9 pm.  I live 30 mins away, it took me 90. The 3 that stayed lived within a 2-minute walk of the office.

I said, ""yes you're a dickhead and you're talking out of your arse, there was nothing running because I tried phoning them all!""   This was in front of all the staff.  A few weeks later, more really bad snow, he gave the Team leader on shift that night a bollocking for not sending people home, which he hadn't done because of my bollocking. 

He started having an affair with a member of staff, and other managers/team leaders started going off sick with stress due to his behavior. He was just vile to everyone, and would actually turn completely red in the face when we stood up to him.

I kept thinking about reaching out but never did.  Then he killed himself, I felt real guilt for a good 10 years after that.

My memory seemed to go to crap over a short space of time.

I was suddenly useless at the quotes game, I couldn't remember unique 8 digit codes and quantities and would need to take the picking list with me.  Other people noticed as well, so I went to see my local GP and the response I got was ""just carry a notebook with your and lose weight!""  This was at the start of the 2000s.

Then it got worse.  I forgot that celebs and some family had recently passed away.  At its peak, I couldn't remember eating things.  My wife asked if I'd eaten the last bar of chocolate, I said no. 5 mins later she comes in with the wrapper having a go at me for lying about it.  I honestly didn't remember eating it and I actually broke down in tears. 

It was shortly after this I went to seek help about my depression, was given meds and managed to dig myself out of that hole.  I still get bouts of depression, less so since getting my pain/autoimmune under control but I still suffer with BPD.

Take photos, post photos, be open to criticism and work on it. One of the hardest things to do is post a photo of something you're really happy with only for some random internet person to come along and tell you all the things that are wrong with it.  But, it's a learning experience, think about what they've said, go and try again. 

practice and practice and practice.

Learn how to use lightroom and photoshop (or free alternatives if you use them) they are essential tools and ignore anyone that says ""you should always have it right in the camera, editing is the devil!"".  Get it as right as you can in the camera but there's nothing wrong with editing.

I use photoshop all the time to remove things like fire exit signs, extinguishers or distracting objects from wedding photos. 

Always shoot in a RAW format, you can recover badly exposed photos much easier that way.

I've a Nikon D700 and D810, couple of SB900 strobes, and mainly use a 24-70mm 2.8 and a 70-200mm 2.8 lens.  Better gear won't make you a better photographer. but you may find that as you progress it starts to limit what you can do.  That's when you look at upgrading.  I used to use an entry-level Nikon DSLR but the performance over ISO1600 was terrible and as weddings are often in churches, I upgraded asap before I did one."

Me:

Dropped out of A-levels at 17 so lost my RAF pilot scholarship.  
Sold computer games in a shop called GAME at 18  
At 19 I spent a year doing a software development NVQ  
At 20 I moved into general manual jobs, picking orders, loading boxes etc.  
At 21 I moved into factory work on shifts.  Due to having a brain, I was moved off lines to work on Weighbridges and dispatch loading HGVs.  Moved into team leader roles, planning loads etc.  
Mid 20's I spent 7 years running online chat teams for online gambling sites and started my own photography business doing weddings  
Around 34 I spent 6 months developing tech for those with visual impairment then got made redundant end of November.    
I needed a job asap so took a minimum wage job running a photography gig at a local garden centre over Christmas, I also worked the tills.  
I then spent 18 months running the IT for a company of 450 people all on my own on crap money.

I now work for a decent company as a Team Leader for an Application Support Team helping banks and insurance companies fight fraud.

So, I can code, work with databases, build PC's. I can drive forklifts, manual graft, load lorries, plan routes etc.  I even did a little work on a building site looking back doing basic labour.

Your future isn't planned out but there is no such thing as a bad job, each has good and bad points.

Take your shelf-stacker, low paid, odd hours sometimes, but you don't take the work home with you. No stress, good work/life balance. Work hard and use your intelligence there is a chance to progress.

Skilled trades such as plumbers, can be good money, usually skilled for life, not much chance of progressing unless you go out on your own but then there are other risks.  Usually, a good work/life balance, when you're off work you're off.

Doctors, long hours, lots of education and debt, high stress, even when you're off you're not really off.  Lots of earning potential.

You work towards what you want to do, they are your dreams no one else's, they don't get a say. Win or fail, be prepared that things may not work out and you and you may end up doing something different. 

There's also nothing wrong with a 'dead-end' job if you enjoy it and you're happy at work and at home it's great :)

I had depression for a good 10 years from around 2007 to 2017, which pretty much masked the BPD.  It wasn't until I overcame depression that the BPD really resurfaced. 

I've done stupid shit for years though and looking back, BPD makes me understand why it happened. 

Once I had BPD I could learn what triggers me and develop ways of dealing with them.

My wife can say something pretty innocent to me, or even not wanting to have sex, and that makes me feel empty, full of sadness and wanting to self-harm at times. I've learnt to walk away and think about what was said, process it and then react to it. 

It's the same with every aspect of my bpd now, I have the ability to kind of take a step back, examine it from an external point of view kind of like being an outsider looking in and it helps me process things.

Depression is horrid, it's like a massive blanket that goes over you and stiffles all joy and happiness in the world.  

The first step is to see a doctor, who will likely prescribe medication. This for some people can be enough, it gives you a break and even with the side effects you start to feel a little. I used that gap to make some changes to my life, exercised etc and managed to break out. That was from a suicidal state. 

Some people then need therapy as well, to see what the underlying issue may be. Again, a lot of people recover from this. but it can be a longer process.

You do get people that never seem to get better. It becomes a part of them and it seems to be their comfort blanket, some people think this is because they don't want to get better. 

Depression tricks you into thinking nothing makes you happy, that you have no friends, that no one cares, that life is pointless, but that really isn't true.  Depression tricks you into thinking you're alone, it's an evil thing. It's hard but if you can try and look at the positive in life, it does help. 

Of course, i'm speaking from my own experiences with it and from others experiences that I've been involved in.  Others may disagree entirely with me, and that's ok, we all have different memories and experiences of it."

I think what you need to start doing is always thinking of your long term happiness instead of the happiness of now.  It's easier said than done but it's proven a successful way of thinking for others.

All the behaviour you do that you don't like seems to give you a little boost at the moment of doing it, followed by regret and sadness afterwards.  Try, before doing anything, ask yourself ""will I be happy about this tomorrow?""  Think about all the bad feelings it gives you doing these things and hopefully, it will motivate you to not do it.

I don't know your history but there may be an event in your past that makes you need to do it, it's something worth exploring, and if you can afford it, seek professional help to talk over it.

Another option is to have a support group of people that you can call on in a time of need, someone who can distract you and move you away from a situation you'll regret. I do this for a few friends and it can work very well.

depression,fomn5xj,t3_g877xw,1587896437.0,"I'm 39 this summer, and I still don't know what I want to be.

I've worked in shop sales, did a year in problem management. Then went to factories, working on lines, weighbridges, then worked into dispatch loading HGV's, worked my way up. Then moved to spend 7 years running a team of chat hosts for an online gambling company, then moved to develop tech for those with visual impairment, then into IT and then to a company combatting fraud and working as an analyst team leader.   

And for the last 10 years, I've been doing photography on the side.  I've done product photography for Bridgestone Golf UK before it closed, and weddings.

I'm on around £31k a year in my current office job, started on £18k 3 years ago, bring in a few thousand a year doing weddings, and if it all goes tits up, I can always go back to driving forklift trucks and loading lorries.

And I'm pretty unmotivated, I have no degree just a can-do attitude at work and sometimes, that enough. 

You have a degree, you're not stupid, but you need to decide what you want to become, and no job is as good as you think it is. Every job has its shit to deal with. 

For instance, becoming a programmer isn't that hard.  

Look in your local area to see what languages / tech are being requested.  Python, C# are the most common in my area.  Then just start learning. 

There are craploads of free resources out there, to make a start. Check out Python Programming Language on Facebook, I mod the page and it's full of stuff (but some of the other mods are overly strict knobs)

Or maybe security analyst?  Work towards being a white hat hacker.  It's great fun which I'm currently trying to get into now, along with carpentry :D  I bounce from one thing to another a lot :D"
depression,fommdhb,t3_g876jr,1587895538.0,"I have 3 children and they are being taught 4 major things:

1) Practice makes perfect - the more we do something, the better we get at it.

2) Even if we fail, come last, or didn't achieve our goal, as long as we tried our very best it doesn't matter.  If we can, we go and try again.

3) Learning is great, keep learning all your life.

4) Mistakes aren't a bad thing. We need them to help learn what to do better next time. Which helps with point 1

Just look at the great things in the world, not one was done the right first time. Not just great things... EVERYTHING.  light bulbs, phones, seats, clothes, cars, food. The final product we know today is the result of making sometimes thousands of tiny mistakes.

Even in nature, if the lions make a mistake they can lose a kill, they go hungry, do they give up?  No, they go back to hunting and try again. 

So, you made a mistake... are you going to make the same mistake again?  Doubtful, so you've just learnt something, and learning is never a bad thing."
BPD,fojycx9,t3_g7lzm9,1587831867.0,"Honestly, you've 2 issues here:

1. ignore social media, turn that crap off and you'll instantly be happier.  Fakebook and other social media sites are purely places for people to fake how happy they are.
2. if you're b/f has anger issues and upsets you a lot. Move on. Life is too long to go through it upset.  You deserve better.  The fact that he puts you down says he's completely abusing you as a way of making you stay with him. he puts you down to make you feel like crap, that no one else would want you so that you stay with him.

YOU DESERVE BETTER!!!

Now, there's nothing wrong with wanting a healthy happy relationship, and I think if you had that, you probably wouldn't care about everything else out there.

depression,fojx3zg,t3_g7rbpv,1587831164.0,"Have you considered that until now they didn't understand how you felt?

This is the first time people who are active and have busy social lives have really had to stop and slow down. That gives them a little insight into how it feels to be cut off, alone and that makes them think more about everything.

Life is hectic. people get caught up in it. I speak to my mum maybe once every 2 months because life just happens.  It's not always a conscious choice, I constantly hear from my wife ""shit, I was supposed to message X today!""  But all that crap is gone now, what's left is what really matters in life, connections to others so it's easier to find time for people.

Now, you can either dig your heels in and do the whole ""you ignored me so screw you!"" approach or maybe use this as a way of reconnecting with people. Stop holding on to the anger and bitterness and work toward making your life feel a little better. I know it would make it better because if you didn't care about it you wouldn't be so angry.

You can be the kind person you wanted them to be, show them the right way to do it, or you can be just like them and ghost them."

MentalHealthSupport,fofa8uc,t3_g76cm3,1587730967.0,"It doesn't matter how bad anyone else has it, you feel like you need help so you deserve help.

The first point would be to seek professional help, many schools now have support staff for such things. I know it seems scary to mention it to your school, but they should try and help, and getting it on record that you're struggling mentally will be considered when they look at things like attendance.

The trick I've found for dealing with self-harm and thoughts of self-harm are:

1) Wait.  the feeling you have will pass so find something, anything to occupy your mind for a bit. different people have different things, programming, art, gaming, exercise.  Whatever it is that you do that makes time pass quickly. We all have something.

2) Always think of your future happiness for everything you do.  Fancy a chocolate bar?  Will it make you feel better right now? YES.  Will you feel better in 4 hours for it? Depends, you might hate yourself for eating it when you're trying to get in shape, lose weight, or be healthier. 

Apply the same process to self-harm. Will it make me feel something now/numb something else now? probably.  Will it make me happy tomorrow and in the future?  definitely not. You'll be ashamed of the scars, you want to hide them forever, you won't want to have to explain what they are and all they'll do is make you think of the negatives you were trying to forget by doing it. 

I know, I battle with it constantly and it's best to not even start if you can.  It takes some will power to start but then it becomes a habit.  I get the feeling now, distract myself and think ""I don't want to have to explain this to my wife when she sees it!"""
DIY,foe3egk,t3_g4980v,1587695232.0,"UK - Sound Proofing/insulation suggestions

Hi all,

We have a carport attached to the house. I'm about to rip the clear plastic corrugate off it, board it and fit new metal sheeting.

I'm then putting in a raised wooden floor and then adding a front, back and sidewall to make it a weatherproof room.  Initially, it's going to become an office and storage space, then just storage with I build my cabin.

I'm ok with the woodwork etc but I'm going around in circles regarding insulation and soundproofing.  We have a loud neighbour who loves talking to her animals and I would like to block it out without breaking the bank.

I was originally just going to stick cheap thick polystyrene insulation in the timber-framed walls, floor and ceiling but the sound deadening is pretty poor.  

Any suggestions as I'd like to try and get this done asap so I can have a proper office space while working from home in lockdown.

thanks"
sysadmin,fodyp13,t3_g6mu4e,1587692642.0,"I am a team leader of a team of application support analysts.

Most calls have a 20 day SLA but that's only when they are with us, if we're waiting for the client to respond they are set to 'responded' and the timer halts. My team are very happy to keep calls on responded for a couple of weeks while clients are testing things.

We want problems resolved and happy customers.

Our manager, wants good figures to show the higher management.  

I had a day off at the end of last month, and actually had 2 of my team Whatsapp me complaining about our manager.  He'd closed 11 unresolved calls that we either needed a response from the client, awaiting input from other teams or were still working on.

The worst part is, he doesn't even respond to the client saying ""we're closing this due to a lack of response"" or whatever reason is needed. 

We then get crappy emails from clients asking why it was closed as it hadn't been responded purely so his figures look better, and if they email back, workflow don't reopen the original call, they open a second one, and half the time it goes to a completely new analyst on another team instead of the original analyst. 

Not everyone in our department are the same, I'm lucky in that my team (apart from a 1 student) want to know the underlying cause and can we fix that.  A new lad managed to completely fix an issue that was causing 116 hours a month in man-hour fixes to data, other teams are just to keep fixing the data errors.

Now, we've a supplier to us who will close a ticket within an hour of replying to us if we've not responded, even if it's a really complex issue.  That really takes this piss as we now have to go through an ex-employee of ours that works there just to get answers.

So, it's not always the person you're dealing with, we don't care about departmental figures, we care about you, the customer. You pay our wages, we want you to be happy. Our managers just want bigger numbers and lower turn around on calls."

I think the thing to remember is, it may not be a cure but it's going to help even if it's only a little bit. Physically better, fitter, happier with your body, accomplishing things... Keep it up and keep fighting x"
