I guess it‚Äôs quite a common problem - I helped the freedom kill the duty folks on the farm and then did a few more quests for the freedom and now the duty soldiers attack me every time I go to the bar. Now, I don‚Äôt remember that happening in past. Duty soldiers used to remain neutral after I had killed them on the farm. Is there a way to become neutral with them again?

In comparison with all extroverted types and even most introverted ones we are indeed rather passive and withdrawn.
