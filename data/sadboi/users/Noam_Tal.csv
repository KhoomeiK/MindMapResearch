depression,fqbeh8d,t3_gea6mo,1589235494.0,"Same, I had someone who I was a friend of his for 10 years and for a period of like 3-5 months I could consider him a very close friend.

But like everything in my life, I manage to fuck this up.

I have encumbered him with my problems and feelings about depression FOR MONTHS. And he had little choice but to end this friendship.He felt helpless, we couldn't enjoy the time together.

Those were the only 3-5 months in my short yet miserable life that I have felt that I was worth something to someone.

Fucking shit, I will never trust myself ever again.I will push people away from me now just for them not to suffer my shitty defeatist, introverted, and unstable personality. And for me not suffering yet another self-disappointment.

I do not deserve friendship, I deserve the suffering and the absolute misery in loneliness and depression.

I wish I could give you all of my remaining strength at the cost of my life (win win for all), because it sounds like you deserve to have a friend.

Don't give up so you won't become like me,  


&#x200B;

I wish you well, and good luck."
