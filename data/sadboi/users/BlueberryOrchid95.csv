BPD,fqeag8v,t1_fqea5ct,1589304361.0,I guess what I mean is you can‚Äôt change unless you want to. You won‚Äôt change until you understand jealous is an issue. I think people let themselves be jealous because they feel like it validates their feelings and urge to self pity. I don‚Äôt want to look like I‚Äôm judging anyone I‚Äôm totally including myself in this. I feel like telling myself that I‚Äôm being immature and unhelpful to myself if i get jealous over things I cannot change helps me stop. That‚Äôs how I operate though. I use a reality check to knock me out of it.
BPD,fqe8oym,t1_fqcg78q,1589303564.0,If you want to stop being jealous you should feel embarrassed to be jealous. It‚Äôll help you knock sense into yourself to stop being jealous. And removing yourself is a good idea if you feel you struggle too much with social media that‚Äôs totally fine
BPD,fqe8kb5,t3_gi3isg,1589303505.0,"we get jealous from how we were raised. That‚Äôs why not all people are jealous. I used to and now I realize that me being jealous only makes it worse. It‚Äôs a need for control and it‚Äôs important to realize that is a bad emotion. People excuse being jealous as ok, and if you want to stop, you need to be embarrassed if ur jealous. If a person makes you jealous on purpose, they deserve to be cut out of your life. If they‚Äôre doing nothing on purpose, then you‚Äôre your own problem and need to realize you need to get over the jealousy because it will eat you up. It‚Äôs just a matter of would you rather not be jealous or does this jealous make you feel valid so you‚Äôd rather sit in it."

BPD,fp06r9i,t3_gab8zk,1588203535.0,I get more jealous over bodies than faces. Or if someone has a really hot boyfriend. I like my face I think I‚Äôm pretty but I think I could lose 10 lbs (~5kg) so it‚Äôs a little annoying because I try to eat less but it‚Äôs really hard. I also honestly think I have the worst personality. Like you can get plastic surgery or diet but I can‚Äôt change my personality. I‚Äôm very awkward and off beat and not in a cute way. Like I‚Äôm sure some people have thought I had autism but it‚Äôs not autism I just grew up very secluded with not many childhood friends in my life so I struggle still with how to be socially. When people have a cool personality and good jokes that makes me the most jealous because I genuinely come across as so weird it‚Äôs genuinely almost creepy or stupid sounding when I speak. There‚Äôs such thing as a cute creepy girl I‚Äôm one of them. And I‚Äôm low key a little vain while still hating myself LOL
BPD,fp06axb,t1_foytym6,1588203292.0,Plastic surgery if it really bothers you it‚Äôs nothing that can‚Äôt ever be corrected. I‚Äôm sure you look cute. Most models look manly

Honestly DM me you prob won‚Äôt even believe it because I don‚Äôt look ‚Äúweird‚Äù or whatever lol. But the world is shifting to less and less friendships. People define friend as an acquaintance that has 1 thing in common with them like liking to get brunch or clubbing. That‚Äôs it usually. Don‚Äôt feel bad that you don‚Äôt have that because friends now aren‚Äôt that close.
From a nursing perspective, I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre most at risk for (RISK not that you will get these things):
‚Ä¢depression
‚Ä¢anxiety 
‚Ä¢eating disorders (from the anxiety)
‚Ä¢Sleep disorders (from the depression)
‚Ä¢Lack of social adjustment skills
‚Ä¢maybe you‚Äôd be accidentally a little self centered or overly giving unaware of social norms in your culture

And guess what? Even if you got these things, they‚Äôre very fixable and able to disappear. No worries at all.

Look I was the most award MF when I started college. I still am an awkward extrovert, but my social skills and confidence did get better when I finally did start having friends. I learned I didn‚Äôt make friends because I was so unconfident in myself. I was overweight, and I wouldn‚Äôt know how to talk to others because I was so insecure. Meanwhile, I saw obese people be popular in college with lots of friends. I didn‚Äôt know how to be as confident as them. For me, I didn‚Äôt find any confidence until I lost the weight and moved to a new city. I needed a fresh start. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre funny, smart, beautiful, and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre great to be around once you learn to get comfortable. Maybe a college therapist or life coach (they‚Äôre free in America if you get it through your university) can help you."

I had one laugh at me when I shared my eating disorder because I didn‚Äôt look the way she expected. I had one get emotional when I said I was r*ped. It‚Äôs like I need them to just be professional and not show emotional and they don‚Äôt. I‚Äôve seen like 50 in my life and I think that‚Äôs enough to know therapists don‚Äôt help me.
