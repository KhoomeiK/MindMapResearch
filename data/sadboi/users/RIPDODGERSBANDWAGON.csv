DoesAnybodyElse,fr05fd3,t3_glohiu,1589784296.0,"Yes I do. (Skip to paragraph four to avoid my convoluted story). I remember the month after I turned 15 I had the weirdest dream ever. It involved having sex with this girl I kinda liked at a sleepover. Then some dude started fucking with time and we were sent back to 1776. Then I woke up. It was 6 am. 

Then I fell back asleep. I was transported back to August 25, 1957 with my dead grandma to my backyard (grandma was 19 then). I had to keep my cool with the random people looking at me weird with my 2018 clothes. I explained I was born in 2003 and some of what had happened. Then my sister appeared and said that I had to save the world. Then this part ended. Then I woke up and it was 7 am.

Then shit got crazy when I fell back to sleep. I went back to 1922 with two of my friends (can‚Äôt remember who) and Gordon Ramsay to save the world from this family who owned a school in the Wild West. There was a father, son, and a grandson. The grandson was like 8 and a student. The father owned the school. He was taken care of when Chef Ramsay grilled him with facts about how he couldn‚Äôt run a school cafeteria properly. He swore and swore and all of the kids laughed. Then the real villain appeared: the son. He was destroying time. So we tried to kill him with a gift shooter (like in Christmas movies) but we weren‚Äôt allowed to. When Chef Ramsay said ‚ÄúPiss off, donkey!‚Äù to him, shit was on. We had an epic brawl and we won. Then my crush popped up outta nowhere, kissed me, and then I woke up. It was 9 am. So basically it was a beat the bad guy rescue the girl story, except wacky af.

That day ended up being one of the GREATEST. I remember being so energized and motivated that day even though I had felt like shit most of the days before it and then most of the days after. This was September 15 I believe so it was less than 3 weeks into the school year which is usually a shit time for me but this day was the biggest outlier that year by far. I went to a football game, I got up bright and early to mow the lawn, I found my baby toys in the basement, I watched baseball, etc. Not an out of the ordinary day but with all of my energy it was great.

Unfortunately that was the last really great day until like January or February. That fall was really bad and the winter was eh. Oh well.

Sorry for the long convoluted description haha.

And ps: No I didn‚Äôt get the girl irl. I stopped liking her by the end of September anyways."
