depression,fkh6x9m,t3_fihvce,1584190671.0,"I would PERSONALLY ADVICE against antidepressants; I would instead try to keep active and self help by maintaining good hygiene and exercise. To clear yourself from depression you firstly need to find your source, everyone’s is different. I’ve been on and off depression for 4 years. But now I know my source so I’m working on that. You’ll have good and bad days."

depression,fk7k14t,t3_fgxz4e,1583938051.0,"I’ve been gym’ing for years. I weigh 65kg and have a body fat % of around 7%. Id describe my physique as athletic. It doesn’t help me feel better. If anything it makes me feel worse, I personally believe I look great, I do all these good things for my body and I don’t feel any better. I still just wanna go home and cut myself. 
 
Physical and aesthetically beneficial activities only help if that’s the reason you feel like you do. I personally have been fucked up emotionally. So it doesn’t help me, it just gives me something to do for a few hours."

Try taking some ice and squeezing it in your hand
 
Lay down and just do press ups to failure 
 
 
 
See how you feel after that"
SuicideWatch,fk4errw,t1_fk477tq,1583859022.0,"I struggle to find people that want to stick around. When I ask people out I always get the same rejecting result, I’m not the most confident guy so it doesn’t help the confidence. Someone did agree to it once, I thought it went well; but I ended up getting ghosted. 
 
So I figured I’d join a couple dating apps, I chose tinder and hinge since I’ve heard a lot about them. I’ve been on there for a fair amount of time now. Unfortunately I have 0 matches. I’m thinking of deleting them now, it’s starting to make me feel worse if I’m honest. 
 
I do have a friend that I like. But it’s out of my control to see her. It’s not easy for her to see me either :/
 
Everyday I get more and more lonely"
lonely,fjnd3ay,t3_fedwac,1583504579.0,"Same here, my friends are all getting married and having kids, I can’t even get myself a date. I socialize and introduce myself to people, but they are mostly “busy”. I get that I’m going to get rejected that doesn’t help my confidence, but not everyone is busy surely. I’ve joined 2 dating apps, over the past month I’ve had no matches, one of which was hinge and the app tells you who likes you, which is also 0. And I wouldn’t actually call myself unattractive either; I’m athletic, I’m in shape and all that, Plus I keep myself in good hygiene. I just don’t understand. 
 
I only have one friend that actively goes out her way to talk to me, which is great because I like her, which also hurts because I can’t see her for reasons out of my control. It’s just sad. So I’m just here on my own all the time."

I get it in waves of severity; some days I’ll be ok and I’m just generally bummed out, and then other days I’ll be imagining my own death as I lay in bed. It’s very strange. 
 
I won’t bore you with the details as why I’m depressed, but I’d say it compounds under scenarios of failure"
