I lost about 30 lbs and have kept it off for more than three years even after returning to eating ""normally."" Although I am extremely mindful of how much I eat now, and I am terrified of gaining it all back (and it was only 30 lbs!). I don't have that kind of discipline normally, so it was definitely the major life event that triggered that kind of change in diet. Calorie restriction gets a bad rap, but running a calorie deficit is absolutely necessary for weight loss. I would never recommend anything more extreme than the 900-1200 a day you followed though."

AskReddit,fpam715,t3_gc95mh,1588451039.0,"If you are very overweight, exercise might be dangerous, or at the very least so difficult that it is too discouraging to make any progress. Fasting is the most reliable way I have found to cut calories and lose weight, and it is very simple. It can be difficult to start because most of us have a deep psychological attachment to food. We use food in unhealthy ways like stress management, and it is impossible to quit food all together to regain control over this addiction. Dieting can be taboo because people are straight up offended by the idea of voluntary food deprivation. However, it is not dangerous to restrict your food intake in a reasonable manner. Beginner fasters usually start with an 8 hour window in which you may eat. That means you have 16 hours in your day where you don't touch food, and you are asleep for about half of those hours. You will know you have an unhealthy relationship with eating when you can't stop even for 8 waking hours. It might be easy, or you might struggle. I have been a healthy weight for three years, but I still struggle with food addiction. Just remind yourself it is okay to be hungry sometimes. Whatever the amount you are eating right now, it is obviously too much. This is advice for weight loss, if you seek optimal lifelong nutrition, I'd suggest talking to a doctor or nutritionist or searching Google for that specifically.  People conflate nutrition, body building (exercise), and weight loss and roll them into one idea. It is possible to eat thousands of calories of ""healthy"" nutritional food around the clock and gain weight. It is possible to exercise and gain weight. It is impossible to gain body fat if you are consuming fewer calories than you are using. The basic idea of fasting is that you end up eating less food, as long as you aren't trying to stuff yourself in your window to make up for your time fasting."

Anyway, I kind of wish she never told me about it. I can never look at him the same because I feel guilty about what I did, but also he seems so phony to me now. He's extremely generous and genuinely nice, but according to my sister he holds grudges like this with multiple people. He probably suffers so much feeling like a victim all the time.
