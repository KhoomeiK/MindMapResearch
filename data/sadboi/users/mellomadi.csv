toastme,fhhwwvo,t3_f39ukr,1581613364.0,"Reason to live: To give us an opportunity to share with you how even as strangers we care about your life and we appreciate you being honest about how you’re feeling. Life is shitty. But it’s also not so shitty when you’re not neck deep in shit. Take deep breaths. The only thing that helps me is acceptance commitment therapy. We need to radically accept that life is shit sometimes & it’s okay to feel like shit sometimes. I’m sure you know by now that these feelings come & go. They will always come & go. There is no magic potion or self help book or strangers in the internet that will make you feel better. First comes the breath, let your emotions be. Be sad and mad and stuck. Then try to accept that this is what life is. Try to write something you’re thankful for like your socks for keeping your feet warm & dry. Or a window letting in sunlight. lil things. It’s a journey of self love and digging yourself out of shit and restarting your days over and over until you find something that makes your day. I got a puppy 🐶 May you find your peace ✌🏼 alive. Living peace. Lol."

AskReddit,f8fz43z,t3_e0p8fj,1574551504.0,"@ age 16 I was in a year long relationship with a 21 year old. Got me to send everything you can think of sexually to him. Half way through he calls me crying and confessing the truth but he loves me and i (am an idiot) choose to say with him despite him being a gross, ugly & 35 years old. Saved money to fly to TX w/ him. I was going to buy the tickets after school but my dad sent policemen to look for me & take me to the police station where my parents meet us & I testified everything. They say he did this before & sells all the videos & pictures of minors. couldn’t get solid evidence on him because he used Skype & would delete/edit sent messages. Instructed me to delete things as we went along. There was hardly any evidence. When the police found his house he was long gone & cleared & destroyed his drives/hardware because i (am the biggest idiot) told him on the way to the station. We had a code for when cops got involved........ 

TLDR: tried to run away with creep after he revealed he was cat fishing me. Year long investigation concluded nothing because I tipped him of when the police got involved. I was 17 he was 35 when it ended. 

Answer to your question: if someone is telling you to delete everything you send to them- something is definitely wrong. I thought that was normal & started deleting everything after I read it at the time. Nope nope nope.

I guess also if someone you don’t know extremely well is telling you to send them explicit because they *”xyz”*- they don’t. Send them a link to pornhub and gtfo"
