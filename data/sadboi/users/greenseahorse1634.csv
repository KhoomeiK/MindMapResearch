SuicideWatch,fiwszfw,t1_fiwqd2v,1582801693.0,"We're at opinion territory here, so I'm mindful to not suggest that you're wrong - merely that I disagree: I think you can 'last longer' for others. I'd be dead by now if it wasn't for the memories, conversations and futures of others send I'd bet I'm not the only one. The thoughts of other people can, in the moment, be one of the reasons a suicidal person stays alive.
I also don't think that there's much difference between crying for yourself and crying for someone else. The situation is sad, it brought up memories, it brought up ponderances of the individuals life. There seemed to be both a caring for others aspect and a caring for self aspect. The individual evoked that response and so I don't believe that the tears were all for the sister."

SuicideWatch,fhscwbz,t3_f4pshz,1581858766.0,"Because death might not come. 
Because I'm still a sentient being and thoughts happen. 
Because I'm a bit like a zombie just walking around doing things ""I'm supposed to do"" while I'm alive.
Because I don't want to die as much of a failure as I was before student debts and work.
Because everyone dies at some point... why do they bother? Just because the way I die will be my choice and at a statistically younger age and just because I have problems with my mental health doesn't mean I don't still have a life. It's shit because of my brain and stuff so I probably won't last all that long but I'm still living.

Last night I cried until 3am. Bawling. Making plans to end my life. Today I'm going to the library to write an essay because I'm worried I won't meet my fast approaching deadline. I might apply for mitigating circumstances. Who knows. I might die before the deadline even arrives... but I might not so...

I got a whole load of thoughts pouring around in my head and whilst the overwhelming ones are the worst ones, I still have 'normal' thoughts too. I still recycle and shit. I'm suicidal - not dead."
SuicideWatch,fhsbcaj,t3_f4l4iw,1581857979.0,"When some of my less close friends (like friends of friends) found out I was in hospital - and more importantly why - they messaged me and said they were there if I needed to talk and that they would rather hear from me about my feelings than me end up in hospital. One was saying stuff like ""I'm confused, you have my number, but I never got a message"". But I know that it'd only be the case once or twice. They'd get to feel like a hero for keeping me alive and (physically) well. But if I spoke to someone everytime I felt like that they'd regret offering.

Sometimes I feel like I might try to talk to someone, but alternate it between 4 or 5 people and save it for when I was at my most desperate so I wouldn't be such a burden on them. But when I'm feeling at my most desperate I don't (for a whole bunch of reasons) feel like I can reach out so it's a moot point I guess."

Me either. They don't want me in a hospital, they don't want me in therapy, they don't want me 'labelled'... They just don't want to know. I'm not sick enough for help. I'm not sick enough for support. They would rather wait until crisis hits (like it did before) and then do just enough to keep me alive - which was treating my blood for toxicity - and send me home. They don't care about the state of my mind, only about the state of my body. I'm not a danger to others so I guess I'm not sick enough to get that kind of help..."

offmychest,f7nf3f5,t3_dws8gx,1573899828.0,"When I get married I'm praying for my bridesmaids dresses. I'm the one who wants them to wear a certain style or colour, there's no way I'd ask them to pay. 

When I was asked to be bridesmaid at my brother's wedding it was the first I'd ever heard of any of this stuff, I was about 19 years old. I was shocked when they asked me for Â£120 for the dress. I didn't choose it, I didn't even like it, I was never going to be able to wear it again. I suggested they keep the dresses and try to sell them on as they'd probably get a bit more money for the set. My mum told me I was being rude.

It all came as a bit of a shock to be honest...I had to pay for a hotel room the night before, even though I didn't live far (like 40 mins drive) so could get there in the morning no problem, and the associated costs like dinner and breakfast adds up too.

I just couldn't get over how I HAD to do all these things and pay for them too! So now, when (if) I get married, I'm just going to ask 2 simple questions:  ""who made this choice"" and ""who benefits"" like if my bridesmaids choose to stay the night in a hotel before because it's let's stress for their journey then they can pay. If I'm asking them to stay because I want to have them with me the night before then I will pay. If I choose the colour scheme but they choose the style of their dresses then we'll probably go halves."
