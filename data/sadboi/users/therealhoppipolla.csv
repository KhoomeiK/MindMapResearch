germany,fgokzaf,t3_ezop9k,1580974058.0,"I just moved in on 1. Feb and rent is all- inclusive. 
3- bedroom, a flatmate N who's been there since May 2019, myself and another flatmate U who also just happens to move in on the same date as me. 
Internet was working for N, but it didn't work for my devices (Android phone, iPhone, MacBook), and on U's devices (Android phone, laptop). This was in the morning of Saturday 1. Feb. 

At 2pm on Saturday, I went to the agency's office which fortunately is just 12min walk from the apartment unit. They just stood there and told me ""it's not our problem"", ""it works for your flatmate N, so it is your and U's devices which are the problem"", and ""we cannot do anything about it"". 

I was getting desperate, because I needed to set up German bank account, anmeldung, proper visa issuance prior to getting my permanent German post- paid. I did not have access to internet at this point. 

Restarting the modem didn't change anything. 

On Sunday, U and N both emailed the agency stating the problem, to which they only replied on Tuesday morning to only U, that again it's not their problem, U needs to Google the solution out, and please do not reset the modem. I was out and did not get this information, so when I came home and at wit's end, I hit the reset button. (U wasn't around, and he is getting impatient as well.) 

The modem asked for Modem Installation Code, which I clearly didn't have, so in agony I went to the agency's office again to get it from them. On my way to the office, I stopped by a Vodafone shop since it is on the way, and they reaffirmed me saying to go to the agency. 

At this point I didn't know about the email sent earlier that day to U. I was screamed at and the looks they gave me were something like I had just eaten their puppies, anyway it's probably cultural difference so I didn't put much emotions into it. 

They blamed me for resetting the modem, and now I'm putting everyone at inconvenience. Sending an internet guy to my unit to check would be charged on me (because I was the one that reset the modem.) 

I didn't agree on paying, and tried to reason with them. On Wednesday morning the guy came (we were not at home) but when U and I tried connecting, it still didn't work. 


On Wednesday evening, the guy came again and only I was home, but he was baffled as well on why internet wasn't working. In my basic German and his basic English, it seems like we both understood that resetting the modem is not a problem since now we have the modem installation code.  


We were told to wait for 4 hours after 18:30, and it's now Thursday morning and internet is still not working. 

Is there anything I/ we are not doing right? Is there something we should be doing? 

Thank you."

Growing up in a one-room flat, her childhood was short-lived as she was forced to grow up early on. She lost her older brother to leukemia at the age of nine, a tragedy that still casts a shadow today.


At 12, her parents split up. ‚ÄúI had to start parenting my parents, talking to them about the divorce and helping them make a decision,‚Äù she shared. ‚ÄúLooking back, that kind of shaped the way I looked at relationships and believed in love. It took me a long time to come to terms with that and to grow into the person I am today, with help and therapy.‚Äù

‚ÄúI just wanted a lot of love, to the point where it wasn‚Äôt practical. I was insecure. When you‚Äôre insecure you just want a lot, even though it doesn‚Äôt make sense and it‚Äôs difficult for someone else.‚Äù

Sometimes the affected students will talk to me after class, and share more about what they are experiencing. Just recently a student talked and cried to me for an hour + after class, she just needed someone to listen and is going through hard time. I don't give advices, I mostly just listen. They know what they have to do in most cases, they just need the courage and strength to pursue it, sometimes time helps too. 

I know yoga teacher friends that are comfortable giving medical advice when asked, I'm not one of them. I'm always playing it safe that way. 

You don't have to develop a personal relationship with your teacher, to me, student- teacher bond is more than enough to promote healing and peace from within.

solotravel,fba1e1u,t3_ec8yrm,1576659393.0,"Thank you for posting this. I would like to share my (almost success) story. 

&#x200B;

I am from South East Asia, and have been wanting to learn Germany and live in Berlin for a long time. 2016 was my turning point- breakup, then changed jobs in 2017 and started a part time job that pays quite well. I then planned my finances to be debt- free, finance my life in Berlin (on German language visa, unable to work when I am there). I moved out of my 3-bedroom apartment (I was living alone- I was spoiled), and moved to my studio apartment which is almost as expensive as 3-bedroom apartment, but it is 5min from my office and I don't pay tolls and save 1.5 hours every day on commuting. 

&#x200B;

In 2019, I have saved up enough for the visa, paid off my loans, all the while visiting Berlin 2 times a year to re- affirm my intention and renew my spirit. I have a corporate job (9-6pm), and I teach yoga before/ after work and on Saturdays. I am teaching up to 15 classes a week, which is a lot for someone with full time job, but it has enabled me to pursue my dreams. I hardly see my friends (once every 2 weeks), only my family on Sundays. I sleep maximum 6 hours a night, but I never really needed more than that and I feel fresh in my waking hours. I do yoga and run, I eat well, I meditate, I save,  and save. 

&#x200B;

I leave for Berlin in January. It is hard work, but it is going to be worth it."
yoga,fb9rmi4,t1_fb9p214,1576647346.0,"Yes. On top of this, since you are already seeing doctor and physiotherapist soon, if you have yoga blocks, lie down on the block for a few minutes at a time to relief muscle tension. 

&#x200B;

One block horizontally on your mid back (bra line/ subscapular level), and one block under your head to reduce the intensity. It's an heart opener in supine pose. 

&#x200B;

After a while it it helps, you can place the block vertically under your spine in between your shoulder blades. Could also play around with the height of the blocks as you go along.

As a teacher, I've had more than a few cases of students crying during class, especially in my yin class.

To those that don't know, yin is a restorative type of yoga where the poses are held for long period of time (2 - 8minutes) depending on the poses, teachers, time of day etc.

I grew up having acnes all my life. My mom had acnes until her late 40s, and now in her 60s she has noticeable box/ pit scars and pigmentation. My derm told me that acnes (at least my case, severe ones) are 60-70% genetics. Anyway, I tried everything (ditching dairy, changing pillowcases every night, washing hair every other day, eating healthy, working out, everything) until I couldn't take it anymore and I resorted to Accutane. Finished my last dose a few months ago, and this is how I am managing my skin now.

I think salicylic and glycolic acids work wonders on my skin type. I did not imagine that my skin will ever be this smooth and acne- free, I am so happy. Not sharing my face here for anonymity purpose, but I am so so so happy. Having a good skin is really good for self- confidence, I used to say no to going out to hide my face at home when I was having bad skin day, which was pretty much most of my days.

Good luck. We've got this!"

I have been told that it is not common to approach strangers in public, and that people make friends through work/ friends of friends, etc.  

How true is this?   


Personally I have been approached by men a few times when I was in Berlin (not at nights, not at clubs) while I was walking around, buying stuff in the supermarkets, etc. Casual conversations (one or two progressed to asking if I have time for a drink)."

TrueOffMyChest,f7dry2g,t1_f7cwj9h,1573627209.0,"Yes. I always have the tendency of calling a spade a spade, but over the years I've learned to only say that in my head. I don't sugarcoat either, j just don't say anything if I have nothing 'nice' to say. 

In most societies it's not acceptable to describe someone as fat, even if they really are. I live in a society, so I will try my best to adapt and not offend people."
bipolar2,f7dqid5,t1_f7dorls,1573625502.0,"Do you think as the person with BP, to dump less on your partner is the better option? I understand that no one method fits everyone. I am with my BP2SO and we are better now that he is more communicative and sharing how he feels with me, and it helps that he is on meds.   


I just would like to understand more from your POV. I think my partner used to think this way too. We broke up a few times because of our lack of communication when he's depressive."
