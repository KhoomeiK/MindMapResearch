The lore is important, it's just that my MC's first course of action is getting away from her dad. The lore comes into place when she joins a guild herself. All of it is important because I want the story to span a prolonged period of time. The inciting incident is her spontaneous powers. 

I don't remember if I said this to you in particular, but it's a lot of information that comes into play as the story goes on. The reason I mentioned it is because the lore and her personal situation is what was compared to HP."

I've shared tidbits about the world of my story and its history in other replies. There's a lot of it, but I answer or clarify any questions or concerns that come up. The thing is, my MC doesn't go to a magic school, though they exist in the world. 

The world of my story has an almost universal goal, but the kick off of my MC's story has to do with her trying to get away from her father's obsession with spontaneous magic abilities (which she gets), because he has a negative background being a non-magic user. Spontaneous magic abilities are apart of the story, though you can be born with magic, or be born without it and can choose to train yourself. The downside of the training is that it can either kill you or make you go mad. 

Point is, there's a lot that I feel is different from HP to the point where it feels like a stretch to say it sounds like HP. Sure, evil is fought, but there isn't someone like Voldemort the entire world is afraid of. And if I could call anything similar to the idea of Voldemort, it's the scientists who try to figure out the reason behind spontaneous magic abilities. And her overly obsessed father happens to be one of those people."

writing,fpj5ky6,t1_fpj3wla,1588657258.0,"In mine, I find it similar to the One Piece treasure in One Piece, if you're familiar with it. There's lore and history and whatnot, but to sum it up as simply as I can, there are two that were once one. One is light, the other is dark; almost like yin and yang. According to the history, the founder of the world's magic discovered it was too powerful and tried to destroy it and himself to bury the knowledge. Long story short, it didn't work and it split into two instead. Legend says that finding either will give you the founder's knowledge and so on. So it's almost like a lifelong mission of trying to find either. Since the task had proven to be so difficult, regular life goes on but people still try. 

There are two sort of societies that magic users enter. When you're young, school, but from there, or instead of there, you can join guilds. And then, of course, there's regular school and careers for people who aren't magic users. 

As for the MC finding out they have magic, I don't relate it to HP because it's a normal, although rare, occurrence. Everyone knows about it but it either happens to you or it doesn't. 

I feel like non-magic users being inferior is almost like the rich looking down on those who are less so. That's magic worlds in general. But since magic isn't apart of everyone's life, it isn't something people are actively ridiculed for. My MC's family just happened to have a super negative relationship with magic. 

My MC doesn't actually go to a magic school. They exist but she doesn't go to one. As for copyright worries, I understand. I've heard about JK Rowling suing people. Though I heard it never went anywhere. She's also been sued, I heard. 

I can go on and on about various aspects of my story, so I apologise this response is so long, but I just want to clarify anything that comes up."
writing,fpiy9il,t1_fpitj7d,1588651613.0,"I think I have a twist. I have elements from various stories: goals revolving finding powerful artifacts, clubs/guilds, noble families. And now that I think about it, in my story there is something called (still thinking of a better name) spontaneous magification, in which people can suddenly gain abilities without prior warning, and the cause is unknown. 

My MC starts going through that in the beginning of the story which triggers a set of events because of the history of her family (father was the only non-magic person in his family which bred an extreme obsession with studying spontaneous magification, mother was ridiculed everyday for not giving birth to kids with abilities which led her to leave, my MC's brother died from attempting to gain abilities, as he was pressured from the father). All of this sets up the conflict of my MC having to figure out what to do so that her father doesn't find out about her spontaneous abilities and ignite his obsession more. 

So I guess that can kind of be compared to Harry Potter (suddenly finding out you have power), but again it's different in my world because everyone knows about it and Harry was a wizard the whole time and just didn't know. The comparisons to HP feel like reaches to me."

In my story, there are non-magic people, but there are also people who have magic from birth or spontaneously get it at some point of their life without warning, and you can train yourself to gain magic abilities but it is a very dangerous process that can result in death or a severe psychological break, so not many people risk it. My MC's life isn't even set up like Harry's. It seems inevitable but am I sensitive to be a bit bothered?"

writing,fojeffz,t1_foixm20,1587818495.0,"I appreciate your input. Thank you. I see what you're getting at, but most of what you mentioned depends on how my story's spiritual realm (The Beyond) works. Questions to be considered: What will happen if Clarissa breaks rules during her time as a human? What will happen if she chooses to defect and permanently live as a human? What would Clarissa's motives be for staying, if any? Being apart of her family's life, even just as a friend, how will she handle disappearing after her time is up? All of these questions are questions that can be formed from my basic plotline without any extra information that would come from the story itself. 

I see what you mean about a simple ""yes"" or ""no"" oftentimes not being enough to get to the bottom of a decision. The thing is, her only official option is to return to the Beyond after her time is up. Anything other than that is completely up to her but, for example, staying human isn't an option she's given at all. Ultimately, I don't think the story even has to talk about what would happen after Clarissa returns to the Beyond, if she does so. It mainly focuses on how she handles her new environment and what that means for the people she encounters along the way."
callmebyyourname,fojdf1d,t1_fojakf3,1587817572.0,"Partly, yes. I have no issue with age gaps. I think the youngest age of the age gap is what makes the difference, if that makes any sense. A 17-year-old with a 24-year-old gives me different vibes than a 30-year-old with a 37-year-old would. From now on, I'll edit that ""wholesome"" bit because not every story has to be wholesome. I think CMBYN strived for something and missed the mark because of the age gap, at least in my perspective. A 17-year-old and a 24-year-old are on two totally different planes mentally. No matter how mature a person 17 years of age may seem, the brain just isn't on the same level as the brain of a 24-year-old. That's where my issue is. 

So many people swoon over the love story of CMBYN but I personally don't think it's anything to swoon over. Aside from the age gap, I just think for someone as inexperienced as Elio to be with someone like Oliver, especially with the way Oliver handled some things, was just unsettling."
writing,foix989,t1_foiw4oc,1587800139.0,"I apologise. I was just trying to make sense of everything you said there because I didn't get some parts of what you mentioned. 

Not only does it act as a source of alienation, it acts of a source of discovery too. I don't have all the details figured out yet, but I want her to be given options. I didn't mention it to you, I don't believe, but I mentioned it in another response that she's forbidden to let them know who she is. 

She's known as a stickler for rules in the Beyond, which is part of the reason she was given the ""gift"" of spending time in the regular world. The time is limited, which doesn't cause any concern because of who she is: a rule-follower, ignorant (in terms of life), a bit arrogant, etc., but all of this stems from her having zero experience as a human. She takes the chance and slowly struggles with the limitations of her gift as she learns and experiences more. Though it's a story about grief, for the most part, I want it to end with Clarissa having to choose between going back to the Beyond or staying alive, which will have consequences she'll have to weigh against her incentives for staying."

I appreciate the compliment. I definitely want to delve into death as less of an event, but more of a darkness that the family of the deceased is left to deal with.

I don't think it always has to be conscious but somehow, I think self-awareness should be there whether it's directly through a character or something that is part of the storyline.

callmebyyourname,fog8t7l,t1_fog33wp,1587749424.0,"Oh no, I agree. It doesn't need to be. I simply expected it to be wholesome. Stories don't need happy endings or 100% positive storylines but what these books lack is self-awareness. Look at Lolita. A man thirsts on a little girl. But people know it's wrong and the book has those moments where it's like yikes. The man even is self-aware at times. But these books don't have that. No self-awareness at all. If anything, Elio being in an age gap relationship again calls to the effects of what can happen in situations like that in CMBYN. 

I'm actually a fan of stories that are controversial in some sense but I think it needs to be addressed. Write about abuse? Show how traumatic it is for the abused and what it does all around. Write about a murderer? Show that no one is ever completely black or white. There's grey and so on. It's like when a villain is evil just cause. That's awful writing because there's no legitimate reason for the actions. Here's another example: many people get irritated when an important character makes a dumb decision but I believe a character doesn't even have to be smart. They can do dumb things or make you question what the writer was thinking, but that's okay as long as there is self-awareness and a genuine reason. Hope this makes sense.

RoyalChaos,fn2eqiz,t1_fn2bno7,1586586445.0,"That's true. Even though I've been on for almost two weeks now, I'm still so confused. Forming your team is like a science. I'm currently working on switching out my heroes' virtue armors. Now that is going to take forever. I can already tell."
mentalhealth,fn2a73r,t1_fn1925g,1586582293.0,Some people like that genuinely need help. Don't be so negative.
mentalhealth,fn2a5vd,t3_fypxt9,1586582263.0,I once read a story about this pedophile that was in prison. I don't remember all the details but I think he was in the hospital one time and was asked if he was ready to go back into the world or something like that but he saw a child and cried. Just cried because he still had those thoughts after getting help for so long and said that he wasn't ready and felt like he never would be. Some people are absolute creeps but some pedophiles genuinely need help.
RoyalChaos,fn29cpv,t1_fn0o9gy,1586581564.0,I hate the maids too. Finally passed it. But I had to be 8000 above their might to do so smh. I don't have good tank characters. I'm working on Prince Jiang or Mulan but I hear that Mulan isn't that good. I'm still trying to get the hang of formations
mentalhealth,fn23jrp,t1_fn1ymj4,1586576898.0,Narrowing my search how?
RoyalChaos,fmu176e,t1_fmtz3c9,1586382665.0,"I see. Hopefully you can soon. Other than that, your formation looks pretty solid. How're your equipment and gems?"
RoyalChaos,fmtyxfm,t1_fmsx027,1586381492.0,I believe my Pan An is in the middle and my Li Bai and Renjie are on the sides. Is that bad? Should Pan An be on the side
RoyalChaos,fmtys52,t3_fx4lz6,1586381415.0,We have a similar formation. Only difference is that I have Li Bai and my MC is a scholar. Is there any way you can switch Zhao Yun to Li Bai or Lord Yi?
trichotillomania,fmty4su,t3_fx7ikw,1586381083.0,I believe so. If you find other coping skills. Best if they occupy your hands so you literally can't pull and do it at the same time
writers,fmtksql,t3_fwrcb7,1586374429.0,"It reads as if it should be spoken, not written. Reading it feels like I should be listening to it through a narrator instead of reading it on paper. Does that make any sense? Not that it's fluffy, but it should be more concise. Sorry I'm explaining it terribly."
writers,fmtk9p4,t3_fwo3g7,1586374167.0,This put a huge smile on my face! CONGRATS!!!! Please update us about how the meeting went.
RoyalChaos,fmfshrg,t1_fmffop3,1586033918.0,Scholar
RoyalChaos,fmdmtn3,t1_fmcp9f4,1585971925.0,"I just replaced gao  and  my line up is now  Li Bai, Pan An, Jing Ke, Xiang Yu, and myself. I'm not even at 200k might yet but I'm so worried about making mistakes. I wish I could just understand it. My biggest issue with Gao that I realized is that even with his passive unlocked, it didn't add much to him."
mentalhealth,fmc0c84,t1_fmadty9,1585936527.0,Really? That seems nice. Was the new plan expensive?
relationship_advice,fmbz5o6,t1_fmbvr62,1585935899.0,"I had the same reaction to the rent comment! The fact that thought even came up as a defense. I immediately thought, ""Huh? Why would you even think about rent?"""
Screenwriting,fmbyiwh,t1_fmbj503,1585935564.0,"In terms of Clint's motivation to kill, please make it more than just ""here's a mentally unstable kid"". It's either used to excuse bs in real life or is overused in fiction as a cop out to giving someone a truly planned reason for whatever they're doing."
kpop,fmbwx9i,t1_fmaxdq2,1585934725.0,"I've been a bit confused. Recently didn't she post a current picture of herself? Or was it a live? And she looked okay. Honestly, I didn't expect her to look okay so did I misunderstand?"
namenerds,fmbwdk9,t1_fmbvp90,1585934442.0,Lol I don't get it. What's the joke?
kpoppers,fmarpoj,t3_ftv3fa,1585905156.0,Link to the simulation?
RoyalChaos,fm8k436,t1_fm7j8kq,1585850827.0,"I've been trying to figure it out, what does AOE mean? And if my player is a scholar, I don't exactly need her, right?"
RoyalChaos,fm79ndw,t1_flrnxta,1585818441.0,I see a lot of people calling Gao bad but he works pretty well for me. Could it be my specific choices or does he suck in the long run no matter what?
RoyalChaos,fm79gsf,t1_fm6zz9w,1585818228.0,Thanks!
RoyalChaos,fm6uotx,t1_fm5zhvk,1585803773.0,I figured it out. I own them no matter what I do. Regenerate just starts them back at one.
RoyalChaos,fm6ufc5,t1_fm6aghb,1585803554.0,I'll shoot a dm now. Thank you so much!
RoyalChaos,fm6ucug,t1_fm6qjg8,1585803495.0,"Okay, thank you. Despite position, go with attack gems? Also just curious, should you aim toward all heroes having gems?"
RoyalChaos,fm69g3q,t1_flthhri,1585789127.0,My MC is a scholar too. Does it matter if it's equipped with attack or defense? Or does that only determine the best placement?
