gardening,flls59m,t3_fpm966,1585266634.0,"I think it is a worm like a cutworm that feeds from the bottom of the leaf.
Check it under the leaf in the eve and in the early am. You could spray it with garlic spray. I used to make a spray cocktail from lots of garlic, small amount of vinegar, and nicotiana leaves(tobacco plant). I would let it brew in the sun for a few days and then spray where they were eating. Works!!!!! There are other mildly toxic plants you can use in place of nicotiana (such as wormwood, foxglove or hemlock)just make sure its not toxic to humans or bees."
