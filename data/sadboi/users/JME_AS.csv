ADHD,fkt2ck9,t3_fkflys,1584504308.0,"I hyper focus on things I love and become incredibly dedicated to finding an answer ( Hence my career in STEM)! I cannot focus on anything else until I feel satisfied. Every new piece of information is always shinier than the last.

Because of my difficultly learning things in the same way as others, I have unique perspectives that provide creative solutions to complex problems. However, this means many people don't understand me right away and debates can get heated.

I am very good at considering MANY variables that may affect a certain thing all at once because my brain does not know how to focus on one thing. It is like I have a neat filing cabinet that explodes open every time someone asks a question. 

Lastly, because I am aware of how carried away I can get with information and thought processes, I have learned how to efficiently triple check everything from mundane tasks to creating complex protocols. This mostly comes from being afraid of being called out for being stupid and lazy or being exposed for my ADHD. However, it has resulted in my being prepared with sufficient evidence to back up my work and is thoroughly accurate in comparison to others.

I say this because if you run out early or let yourself take more than you are supposed to, your doctor may suggest taking you off the meds if you aren't up front. My doctor has totally told me to go ahead and take an extra before but doctors worry about addiction. Just something to keep in mind. Make sure to not lose the trust of your provider. I am assuming you can't call them now but maybe call them tomorrow. 

BUT if I have been in your position before and have taken another (adderall). Just make sure you don't make a habit of it and let your doctor know that your current dose isn't enough. They may be able to mail you a prescription."
ADHD,fkszuib,t3_fkhhs2,1584502421.0,"I have a long response but I hope it is helpful. You are going to be ok! Stimulants are very safe and reliably wear off within a reasonable time period. I have never been super high from it because the prescribed doses are often low enough. Here is what I know and my experience as a high anxiety person on stimulants.....

So I have PTSD and ADHD. They are definitely effect me separately but also interact in a way that keeps me from coping appropriately. I am on lexapro and adderall. I was really afraid at first because there was a huge stigma about medications in my family but I was completely surprised on how much they helped my anxiety.**I cannot believe it didn't increase my anxiety and it actually works extremely well with my SSRI.** 

**Keep in mind that stimulants can make your heart race a little bit even if you are ADHD but as long as it is within in normal range you will be ok**. I am super prone to PANIC. I had a few panic attacks when I started lexapro because I let my fears of medication take over. I started to obsess over new sensations that were harmless. However, I haven't had any panic attacks or anxiety induced from the stimulant. **It can take a little time for us to adjust to these things and I am so happy I stuck it out because I am doing SOOOO much better.** 

Here is my unprofessional advice based upon what I have learned and experienced. Please take it with a grain of salt and make sure to talk to your therapist or doctor about these things.

1. **Be sure to communicate with people you trust and your doctor about how you are feeling** even if you think it isn't a big deal because it may help you stop whirling about what a new experience my mean for your health.
2. **If Ritalin doesn't work for you, it doesn't mean you don't have ADHD.** It may mean you need to adjust the dose or try a different family of stimulants. Concerta (closer to ritalin) did not work for me personally but Adderall is perfect. While on concerta, I felt irritable and foggy. 
3. If your anxiety is the result of struggling to cope with ADHD, your anxiety will likely decrease with treatment from stimulants. BUT keep in mind that you may need to manage anxiety separately from ADHD. **It doesn't mean stimulants aren't an option or won't be helpful but just be mindful that stimulants are not always that best treatment by themselves when anxiety, depression or other mental health disorders are at play.** 
4. If it is working for you but you find yourself a little too jittery or your heart is racing, you may need a lower dose. However, **I have found that some of those symptoms are a sign that the combo of meds AND not eating or drinking enough water.** 
5. ADHD has core symptoms but can affect people differently. **If your inability to complete tasks or focus is interfering with your life, I think it is safe to give treatment a chance**. I am working towards my PhD and have coped on my own through most of it but my ability to get simple tasks accomplished caused HUGE problems in my life. Throwing anxiety and depression on top of it made it even less manageable. So I don't mean ""interfere"" as in a lack of success. **If you have to spend hours getting yourself prepped to do something or make many adjustments to sit down and work, I think it is fair to start investigating what the cause of that may be.** Sounds like ADHD to me but keep an open mind."

You can experience lows in your life because of it but you can also be very successful. I would like to say that you should never give 150% of yourself to anything. I have noticed my commitment and level of structure comes and go in spurts. When I‚Äôm not fully into something I committed myself to(my career), I try to find out what will work for me to get through it. My diagnosis has informed me on how to adjust my life to work for my ADHD brain. When a period of time comes that I am more engaged, I try to run with it. Again, with or without ADHD, long term sustained motivation is nearly impossible. Though it is harder for some of us, we shouldn‚Äôt view ourselves as incapable or fully disabled. 

In the end, try not to fixate on the negatives and focus on moving forward.

As an outsider at the time (before my own trauma), I realized he was harder on himself than anyone else was. I never understood why until recently. There is so much anxiety involved that as long as our minds don‚Äôt feel well, it is difficult to see the successes in each day. It‚Äôs easy to be already overwhelmed and then be further debilitated by recognizing you are struggling to cope.

Recently, a friend suggested that I look back on my day and note all the things I did (no matter how small) and/or positive things. I literally started reflecting back that I took a shower but honestly it did make me feel better. Identifying self care was important for me at the time because I struggled with it and I needed to reflect back on the fact it made my day a little bit better. Seems silly but it goes a long way. I have a long a way to go but focusing on the things you struggle to do just amplify the already crippling anxiety.

My doc is not planning on taking me off the SSRI but the combo works really well for me. However, everyone is different. Some people get irritable on stimulants so I wouldn‚Äôt personally feel comfortable using the Adderall to control my anxiety and depression.

bioinformatics,f098hyg,t3_d471r0,1568495949.0,I am a PhD student and self taught bioinformatician. I study somatic mutation accumulation in plants and often have to adapt bioinformatic pipelines for the purpose of my research. I wished I had computer science skills prior to my program but my knowledge in genetics is what made me really successful. You can learn the coding on your own but if you don‚Äôt understand the biology behind what you are doing you will often have to go back to fix your results.
ADHD,ezrsbgi,t3_d1ykst,1568078095.0,"Thisroughbeast brings up a really good point. If you abuse meth you may be at risk to abuse a prescribed stimulant trying to replace the effects of the meth. BUT there are non stimulant options for ADHD. You should definitely get a new doc but focus on depression and anxiety first because they are less manageable than ADHD. People often use because they need help. Go to NA if you can. I have had many family members join those groups and be pretty successful as long as you take it seriously. 

You are doing the right thing by admitting you have a problem and that there are deeper things causing this. Don‚Äôt be ashamed! Reach out and ask for help. Don‚Äôt let people shame you out of pursuing recovery and proper treatment.

God speed my friend"
ADHD,ezrp91y,t3_d203ds,1568076924.0,My favorite is ‚Äúshow them what you are made of!‚Äù. The feeling of being less than or letting people believe I‚Äôm not capable really pisses me off because I know I‚Äôm smart and/or capable of. Maybe not the best to work off what others think but I have potential and it makes me feel good to prove it. For example: I didn‚Äôt join school for this reason but I want to prove to my instructors I can figure a problem out. So ‚Äúshow them what you are made of‚Äù.
ADHD,ezr5c5r,t3_d1j352,1568068970.0,"So he is reducing points for ‚Äúlateness‚Äù, which you have accommodation for? But not content or correctness? I am a graduate TA and ADHD. I don‚Äôt personally have accommodations but we are under strict rules on handling students with disabilities. We also need to be objective as to why points were deducted and document them. We CANNOT just feel like a student doesn‚Äôt deserve a particular grade. I think a lot of the advice you got is good but when you report him you need to highlight the language he used to indicate the lack of professionalism. Print all the emails and don‚Äôt meet in person with him without someone present. He sounds shady."
ADHD,ezr3uc7,t3_d1u3gl,1568068162.0,Reward yourself with time to browse the internet in your breaks.
ADHD,ezr3or3,t3_d1u3gl,1568068074.0,"I‚Äôve tried many pomodoro apps but I really like the Pomodone app. It can sync to Trello and Evernote. It logs time spent working but also allows you to complete tasks. I have it on my computer and phone. My favorite part is when it tells you take a short break there are 3 options. Mine is at 5, 10 or 15. Also some apps won‚Äôt let you keep working or keep taking a break but this one will. Seriously give it a try."
ADHD,ezqu3g0,t3_d1wngh,1568063971.0,I need a nap after opening mail. I have 3 boxes of mail by my couch to try to force myself to look at it. Usually I just hide mail...
ADHD,eznx4dw,t1_eznwlgd,1568012933.0,Well there have been some recent research that have resulted in deaths of fairly young people with vaping. I really would just like to quit my nicotine habit all together.
ADHD,ezns68c,t1_eznp20x,1568010682.0,lol if it was more exciting I‚Äôd never probably buy it....and probably only read the cover.
ADHD,ezmx2vu,t3_d1kclr,1567998056.0,"You could ask your doctor to not talk about treatment options with your mom. Instead, maybe indicate the psychotherapy or behavioral treatment is what is being sought out. It shouldn't be her business to know anyway but instead just to answer honestly about you."
ADHD,ezlzr0q,t3_d1g3a3,1567984109.0,They should turn books about ADHD into comics. I'd invest in that.
ADHD,ezkopk7,t3_d19abr,1567963947.0,I use Evernote and Mendeley. I caved and got the premium version of Evernote. It can keep track of so much! It‚Äôs easy to look up key words in your notes. I use it for everything now. Mendeley is great but I am windows user. I really like that it offers a Chrome extension and can sync with Word. There might be options for Mac but I‚Äôm not sure. I also like that Mendeley has an option to write notes on the pdf and in a separate section. This is super helpful when keeping track of hundreds of articles.
ADHD,ezkl3x0,t3_d1bg7o,1567962139.0,I just discovered sleep masks when given one on a plane and I now fall asleep immediately even if my meds haven‚Äôt worn off.
ADHD,ezke5yx,t3_d1ccz8,1567958933.0,It‚Äôs boring. I turn my little chores into a dorky dance. Sometimes I‚Äôll even start outside after a smoke and I‚Äôll run in(literally) and start sweeping with a dorky dance etc. It helps if you have music on before you came inside. I don‚Äôt feel bad for any family or roommates.....shit got done that way.
ADHD,ezkdhul,t3_d1cn7l,1567958650.0,I am overly curious and not easily impressed by something. I‚Äôm always looking for something exciting or completely new.
ADHD,ezkcsrn,t1_ezhu7vy,1567958376.0,Thank you for this. Things you brought up I know deep down but can never seem to remind myself of them when I‚Äôm feeling this way.
ADHD,ezkc5bb,t1_ezitrru,1567958136.0,I do use separate journals for things and a variety of apps but nothing can replace my planner and colored pens.
ADHD,ezhdqot,t3_d0lb55,1567909005.0,I have a Red Bull addiction üò¨
ADHD,ezhallq,t1_ezhae6p,1567907799.0,"Yeah I‚Äôm so bad. Basically, wherever I set an item down that‚Äôs where it stays. I‚Äôm a damn mess. Someone send HALP! Lol"
ADHD,ezhaa41,t3_d11duz,1567907681.0,I basically move the paper bag to where I‚Äôm sitting. I also just started re-organizing  my house where everything is out in the open so I can each items home. Otherwise I can‚Äôt remember where it goes.
ADHD,ezh7x6u,t3_d0veae,1567906766.0,"I have 4 small pill boxes that are for one week. I have a tendency to not refill them hence why I got a few. I keep one on the counter and the others in a drawer. They are labeled week 1, week 2, week 3, week 4 so I can‚Äôt mix them up. Each of them have a little zipper case. 1 is black and the other 4 are purple. The case I‚Äôm currently using is always in the black case."
ADHD,ezh73se,t1_ezh6ts8,1567906447.0,Exactly! The right SSRI can be really hard to find and requires a lot of trial and error. Don‚Äôt lose hope if you don‚Äôt get immediate results.
ADHD,ezh6s4u,t3_d0zxpf,1567906326.0,So I just found out I have ADHD at 27 but struggled through grade school. The one thing that made me shut down is when I felt my teachers didn‚Äôt care or when they would unknowingly say things that made it feel like I was worthless. I have no way to tell you how to teach them but I remember feeling really sensitive and just read that is really common with children with ADHD.
ADHD,ezh68hw,t1_ezh5vy3,1567906113.0,Yeah you should probably talk to your doc about treating your ptsd. I‚Äôm sorry you got a lot to deal with. I can definitely relate. Adderall is fine for me but I‚Äôd assume it wouldn‚Äôt be all that helpful without my SSRI. Everyone is different though.
ADHD,ezh3i4x,t3_d11akf,1567905069.0,"I have spent WAY too much money on organizational tools. Be careful. I have recently found that I have a spot for keys, lighters and my wallet. That has really helped. No organizational tool can make you be consistent. Consistency is my bff! Otherwise, I hope it works out! Some tools help a lot."
