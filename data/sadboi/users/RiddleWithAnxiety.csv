depression,fd5z2rk,t3_ejw74l,1578183314.0,"I totally understand what you are saying, I was a senior in high school and had no idea what to do with my life, I tried killing myself, I was scared of a possible future because I was such a mess. 
But I'm 20 now, in college, I have great doctors that help me get better, some things are still a mess, I don't know what the future holds but doing so much better. 
Your life isn't over, you could be 40 and still be young and waiting for a part of your life to start, try getting medical help because once you get it, things start looking up, do things by yourself, find your own way to life."

Just hang, if you are still here you are doing fine."
