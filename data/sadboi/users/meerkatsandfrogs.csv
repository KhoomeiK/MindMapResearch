2- They do the inhuman thing of organizing oral exams for every course, which I've since learned that this is also very common in high school

3- Professors (and people in general) just DON'T speak English. And if you happen to come across one that does, they do it with a very think accent that hinders your learning

4- They have subclasses within their classes, with different professors for each class, which, if you're taking 4 apparent classes, you're really taking 10 different classes with more course load than I did in a portuguese university

5- Classes end at 2pm, which means that I actually get to have lunch at 3pm, and this is beyond late for me or any portuguese person
