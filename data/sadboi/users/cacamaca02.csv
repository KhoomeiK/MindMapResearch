You are a very handsome guy and the nose fits perfectly with your overall facial structure. Your friends are just exaggerating for some reasons I can not define myself,  maybe they are also insecure or jealous of how handsome you are, but honestly I would consider getting real friends who don't pick on what hurts you the most.  I am a big nosed person and I know that not because people tell me, but because that's jut how my nose is. I can also empathise when I see someone big nosed on the street, but it's not the case for you. I repeat, your nose is completely normal.  I completely understand the shame you must feel but you don't have to put yourself down like that anymore, you're a handsome young man with a perfect nose and it's not a compliment but a fact."
