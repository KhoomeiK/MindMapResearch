On the other hand, I (and many many others) have never experienced a full blown panic attack. there's nothing subjective about panic attacks, it's pretty obvious if you have one or if you don't. hence why i do think panic disorder makes sense as a diagnosis.

i'm just saying that i don't think GAD should have a label, because it is all subjective. it is true that there is a line where it goes from not impacting functioning to impacting functioning, but even that line is subjective from person to person. like i said in another comment, i'm not advocating it to be taken down from the DSM.  this sounds contradictory-- basically i think people who get diagnosed with GAD have more crippling anxiety, but they are still on a spectrum with everyone else, *but* labels do make it easier to medically treat people so i don't think it should be removed as a diagnosis."

the difference between bipolar disorder and depression is mania. you literally cannot be diagnosed with bipolar if you haven't experienced hypo/mania, and everyone who HAS experienced mania has bipolar disorder by definition. most people will go their entire life without experiencing mania, whereas almost everyone will have experienced depression at some point.

i'm not trying to be like ""bipolar is valid, depression isn't"" because at the end of the day, im sure what i experience is much easier than what some people with severe depression experience. all im saying is that i don't think it makes sense that it is its own condition when there's no way to objectively measure it.

to be clear, i'm not advocating for it to be removed from the DSM or something, becaues i think its helpful for that label to exist so people suffering with depression can get the help they need, it makes it much more effective for a doctor to be able to document the symptoms and put a label on them rather than just put a list of symptoms in a file."

i absolutely am not trying to discredit people who have anxiety, i couldn't go through the day without my gabapentin. having high levels of anxiety can really harm your life, i just think it's not a condition on it's own because there's no way to measure it objectively, and distinguish it from person to person except their own narrative."

depression as a part of bipolar is in my opinion a clinical condition. if you experience a true manic or hypomanic episode, you are bipolar and you will be for the rest of your life. there's no gray area except that some people's mania or depression is more severe, but if you experience mania you have this condition no matter what.

I will say that I disagree with you on the idea that Latinx came from people being upset that male is the default. I go to a very liberal uni (uc berkeley) and talked to many people who use Latinx, and 99% of the time they attribute it to wanting a gender neutral word for people who are non-binary gender. 

I can see why male being default could have sexist roots (although with how rooted it is in Spanish, I don’t think there’s anything we can do about that), BUT my point is that the male version is gender neutral so people who are gender binary can use the “male” aka gender neutral pronouns.

Besides, Spanish isn’t as simple as English where you can just say “they/them”. Almos every single descriptive noun has a gender (ex: doctora/o, profesora/profesor, jugadora/jugador, etc), so what are we going to do then? There’s really no way to change ALL of these words, adding an X to them is not going to work.

Also the idea of adding an X is very euro-centric because that’s not even proper Spanish. It’s like adding an “ñ” to English— sure I’m sure people could pronounce it, but it’s not English because that word isn’t a part of the English alphabet. So at the very least someone who actually spoke Spanish could’ve come up with it but “Latinx”? I don’t think any of my family members could even pronounce that. Let alone adding an X to every single gendered word just because a non binary person doesn’t understand that the male form is already gender neutral."

But the N word is also a racial slur, and I think we’ve all come to terms with the fact that black people can call each other the N word and not be considered racist against blacks right? What’s the difference?"
rant,f3rlrxg,t3_dhow9k,1571089257.0,"She’s definitely not alternative, but you have to admit she’s one of the closest things to alternative we have rn in the mainstream. 
It’s a little paradoxical because if it is mainstream, it can’t be considered completely alternative and vice versa. 

But her music is pretty unique, and she actually has an amazing voice. Listen to her singing Xanny live, it’s wonderful. A little overrated? Yeah probably. 

And yes her fan base is really toxic, mostly teenage girls who are r//notlikeothergirls ."
berkeley,f3oyokr,t3_dhk8bp,1571034099.0,"i don't understand why everyone gets so triggered when her confessions are posted though. They are usually posted as ####.5 so it doesn't take away from any of the other usual posts, and its not everyday either. Some people really enjoy her, and confessions cant please anyone. If you don't like her, just dont read them."
Conservative,f3onay8,t1_f3ogppx,1571022575.0,"I encourage you to learn about some Latin American history. 

Hispanics are a result of mixing between the indigenous and the European Spanish (usually because the Spanish men would rape the indigenous women). Some countries like Mexico have a higher proportion of indigenous blood, and some like Argentina are almost completely European, and everything in between. Most Hispanics have some African ancestry too. You’ve probably met tons of Hispanics and never realized because you figured they must be white.

This is why Hispanic and Latino is an ethnicity, not a race, and a lot of Hispanics get put into the white or black category if they appear that way. Frankly it probably has nothing to do with news trying to alter stats one way or another."

mentalhealth,f33od8g,t3_dfhrh3,1570642129.0,"Hard to say for sure but remember bipolar is categorized into mania or depression. Being talkative and enthusiastic one day and depressed the next is not bipolar disorder, unless those moods last at least a few days to weeks/months.
I guess to give my experience, I was also diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and then one day my doc increased my dose of sertraline and I quickly went into a hypomanic episode that lasted about 2 weeks and ended with a really bad crash of depression. 
So yeah if it’s on and off it COULD be rapid cycling of bipolar but it’s not very common. Another thing is sleep — mania often results in people getting very little sleep, often not sleeping for days. Also starting new projects is really common— thinking of new ideas and just doing a million different things at once. It seems like your symptoms mostly align with classic depression, maybe your depression has varying severity from day to day?

At the end of the day, ask your doctor! 
It’s pretty dangerous to be on antidepressants without being on a mood stabilizer if you have bipolar, so tell them ASAP."

IWantToLearn,ey05bz8,t1_exvlx7c,1566674630.0,"normally, I would feel skeptical about these methods (ie. that would never work for me, etc). But hearing how successful it was for you, I will give it a try! I have watched bug videos and been scarred for weeks, but I would rather be a little freaked out about a video than have anxiety attacks every time i find  a small spider in my kitchen. 

Thanks for the advice!"
mentalhealth,ev8uh42,t1_ev8nmau,1564292024.0,"The period of possible mania and zoloft dosage change was about 3 weeks ago. It was also around the time when I started Nortriptyline, but I take it for migraines so it's a very low dose and my doctor said I wouldn't really feel the anti-depressant effects of it. If you don't mind me asking, do manic episodes end very abruptly? Because all of this time, I didn't think much of my change in behavior, just thought it was odd that I wasn't getting sleepy at night. What really made me think about it was that the day after the episode ended, I was probably the most depressed I've ever been, I felt suicidal and slept like all day. It was such a massive contrast to how productive and driven I had been the days before. Is it normal for manic episodes to end this way, or do they end smoothly and gradually? By the way, today I feel back to normal-- not super depressed or manic.

Thank you for the help, my doctor doesn't work on weekends and this was giving me a lot of anxiety lol. Oh and my caffeine intake is pretty high, but it always has been (I drink about 3-4 caffinated drinks a day)."
