I don't know why you're looking around to reqruit JW members on a psychopath sub but honestly thats a bad idea... no wonder you guys think the world is about to end. 

Most people here are not actual psychopaths btw in case you didn't knew, so it might go well a few times and then you pull in an actual demon. And yes psychopathy can be cured but not without the right techniques, therapy and god can help but its hard. Most of the time psychotropic plants like shrooms are needed to strengthen the emotions and train this area of the brain.

Honestly it would be a good thing to do since this is not actual drugs but more like medication for your soul, god created these plants for a reason and you can buy it legally.

There is a big difference between using drugs and using medicine. Morfine or ketamine can be administered to a JW for medicinal purposes even though they are also street drugs. Even cocaine is used in some operations.

The point is that if its used responsibly as a medication which it is, and not as a 'drug' they will be okay. Its good for getting rid of demons and bad spirits if you know how to use it. All you need to do is believe he will be healed and affirm his feelings. After this the magic will happen, and he might be healed a bit, or burst out in tears of grace depending on the individual. 

And yes you are right there is a chance demons take over for some time, this is okay and you should not feed them with fear. Then everything will turn out alright.

Well it doesn't need to be, but if you want to feel the full grace of god you'll have to meet each and every form of him. Do not physically hurt people or yourself while doing so and try to remain calm.

Its actually really saddening to see that so many believers exist and yet they blow each other the fuck up.

People shit about 9/11 being preplanned demolition and shit... well let me enlighten you. It was an actual terrorist attack. My dad works in the military and had a briefing about it, you know the plane that 'crashed'? Well it was on its way to the white house after the twin towers got hit, and they shot the plane down with rockets and passengers on it. Honestly it was the right thing to do since not shooting them down would mean that they or had to shoot it down above enhabited ground, or it would crash in the white house... any of those options would mean the same.. passengers dead. They where actually already dead. On the news they told everyone that the passengers died as heroes while trying to overtake the plane, its a beautiful lie but thats about it. Its saddening how they glorify terrorism, fighting, and battle. 

Anyways this is what I know is been briefed in the military, idk if its true or just more true, not judging it.

What I do ask myself tho.. how come random people go up to an airport, hijack planes, crash in towers and then try to crash in the white house?

Its not just an idea you work up to overnight you see.. and there have probably been countless trials at communication which turned into absolute despair up to the point where they start blowing themselves up for self preservation."

People seem to be awakening including psychopaths

I have theoretical scientifical soon to be proof of what psychopathy exactly is and how it can be cured.

Its a developmental brain disorder which causes you to not give a fuck about right and wrong even though you'd rather be a good person. Curing it is actually really simple and fun to do. But don't trust my word on it I'll get the evidence soon. I have the evidence already but I just need to prove it in a way that scientists who are quite difficult and ignorant will understand it.

Much love to you because deep down you guys are all kind hearted, you just have a really small heart because it didn't develop yet ;) this has advantages and disadvantages, the disadvantage being that well... you hurt people. The good thing about this is that there probably is no 'absolute' psychopath and only something that can be approximated. Another good thing is that you developed the rest of your brain very good because of this, there is just a lot of untapped power in you because of missing connections. Once you can outsource the emotional work to the parts of the brain that are actually supposed to do this you'll probably become more intelligent and compassionate, more responsible and better able to manage yourself.

This is all hypothetical but I know its true.

To be honest I don't think you need to change yet, first all other people need to change and the psychopaths are the ones who have it the hardest with this. So blaming psychopaths for their misery is just childish.

You guys had a rough life, even if your environment treated you okayish. Everyone in the environment should be 100% focussed on helping you guys out and making your life more comfortable imo, its easily doable. And if its not for you guys then its for other peoples self preservation.

Ever since I realised why I'm traumatised I became a lot more sociable. Then they told me to take antipsychotics and they fried my brain. I stopped taking them after 2 days and I'm currently more than 2 weeks clean from them but still brain damage.

I've got a lot of experiments that can go public which easily prove how damaging and fraudulent the pills are but I choose to not release this since its currently pointless and would cause more conflict, which is not what the world needs.

I have no fear, I'm empathic

And yes you are wired differently. I'm also but still I'm wired differently now than 3 weeks ago. Wiring constantly changes and personality is not static.

You can evolve or devolve, both are equally valid options but one is really retarded to do in my opinion.

Scientific evolution went fast, emotional evolution is really messed up and if we don't manage to fix this the world will be in shit in probably 1-2 years. Nobody really wants that I think.

I took those pills and can say for 100% that its a fake disorder, I don't think its a real conspiracy but some guys are probably making really good bank from it.

After I took the pills I experienced voices, mixing up words, no emotions, headaches, I even felt my brain short cirquiting and frying AFTER taking the meds (+-80 minutrs after the pill)

Also motory issues and tics or spasms.

Those chems are pure toxic crap.

I took them the first time too, not much was going on except for being a braindead zombie thinking it was cuz of the psychosis.

(Im talking about the LOWEST dosage available btw, 3mg invega)

Anyways I gtfo after that and then found out that many of the stuff was fake and made up. Like litteraly weed doesn't even cause a psychotic break. Panic does.

Then there are the combos they don't mention...

Invega + weed = biggest panick attack and parranoia ever.

I'm so traumatised by it that I litterally do not trust anyone anymore. I'm still very sociable (which I wasn't on pills) but still have trouble with mixing up words and completely dulled emotions (I only took 2 pills about 2 weeks back.)

This crap is really messed up. If he needs to take the pills make sure he takes them while in a ""parranoid"" state. A state of fear, trauma, war, psychopathy, hate, confusion.

Not in a state where he is friendly or manic. 

If you take this shit while in a manic episode you fry your head worse than any drug I ever took (I took a lot of shit) even on the lowest dosage.

If you refuse to take the medication the psychiatrists also tend to give you some kind of sleeping pills. Don't take them especially if there is a high mg content (higher than 20mg) or if the pills have other uses except for sleep (antidepressant, mood stabiliser, ...)

You shouldn't take sleeping pills, if you do go for something like zolpidem/stilnoct and not some weird off label pills nobody knows about. Its downright sketchy"
abuse,fqnni1r,t3_gjse15,1589498052.0,"Okay the word schizophrenia has dropped. I have been in the same situation

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEAE PLEASE PLEASE

get him out of there. Whatever you do, don't become defensive or agressive. Ignore everything and STAY CALM AT ALL TIMES.

Do not think. Clear your mind and stay in the present moment, do not think about whats going to happen next year, next month, next week, next day, next hour, next minute, next second.

Be present and be a mirror of the environment. Mirror body language completely and repeat the same words she says constantly and DO NOT STOP REPEATING THEM even after she stops or feels interrupted or whatever. Copy her complete story.

Do not rationalise your way out of this, it is NOT POSSIBLE.

Don't take the meds under any condition and know there is nothing they can to to get him to forcefully take meds.

Let me talk with your friend if you want, I can help him out especially if he has psychosis like symptoms and maybe gives of a weird vibe.

If he does the most important thing to do is well.. not worrying. That is litteraly all.

But the thought train can be really hard to stop because of stress.

Gtfo there as fast as possible, I'm talking about better to sleep under a bridge than stay at home because it will not get better. Mirroring can make things easier and give the mother a real big headache that can slow down things but thats all.

Keep thinking positive, but hold your ground. Nobody can force him and he has rights, but keep in mind how fragile this situation is if the word schizophrenia drops. Litteraly the only way to get out of insanity is by staying calm and collected and laughing it off or something and have a laugh with the police officers about how much his mom worries and how stressful the quarantine was for her.

Keep things simple and mouth shut.

Don't argue, its pointless.


Please make sure he gets this message and let him message me or sth if he needs any advice or info.

This post is a lot of negative information but the only thing you can do really is give him this info and just validate his feelings. If he has delusions, don't worry about it, see it as a methaphor for something. Usually it is caused by childhood trauma (cptsd) which also causes delusions because the whole truth is too much to bear. Please respect this and don't tell him he is crazy.

Say something along the lines of, well that doesn't seem quite right yet but you're on to something. Try to stay positive and if you fly off don't forget to land too sometimes."
psychopath,fqni8wx,t1_fqndcjf,1589495324.0,"This is true, however its not the full truth.

Lsd and mdma can in fact help, A LOT.

It's pointless to spend years on recovering if you can fix it with some meds and kinda be over with it.

You see... the meds don't fix the problem they only let it surface. Once its on the surface its something mentally tangible and you can start working on it instead of wasting years of time not getting it to the surface but trying hard.

Sometimes we need to use drugs not for ourselves but for others.

You see... a flower can only grow if its environment is good. 
If you have a shitty environment, or better said... an environment that does not serve you correctly, even though it might be a 'good environment' in the cultural context... then the flower will not grow.

If the flower does not grow you don't need to buy a new flower because the flower is broken...

No... you fix the environment.

Now what you can do is the following 2 options

Go on a trip to some fucking high mountain and be alone for 2 months meditating until something finally clicks.

Take some dmt, ayuashka, shrooms, maybe even weed. Lsd or mdma but those are chemicals so idk.

And then create  the right environment inside your head.

There are a lot of different approaches.


Why for example do you say that you shouldn't use drugs for it? But when the doctor gives you meds its actually a good thing to take them?

Its a very grey area and people seem to be uninformed.

You see, meds from a doctor can fuck you up... I mean really FUCK YOU UP.

Drugs can also fuck you up, but some of the meds of doctors are way worse than the other crap, they just target different areas of the brain making it seem okay. However inside the patient it is NOT OKAY.

It supresses everything without solving it.

Sometimes people don't realise their true talents, or their true life style.

Now you can go pack your bags to tibet and join the munks for a year or just take shrooms while listening to good music and exploring your inner world without fearing insanity and staying positive, accepting what comes at you.

Both are equally valid options, just as not fixing the problem and just going along is. The end result will be the same

Death."
psychopath,fqn48gk,t3_gjmjps,1589488399.0,"Don't worry, if its not fitting you're trying the wrong hole. Never give up bro, I honestly feel you and I think some lsd or mdma would do you good together with the right kind of therapy. 
Its best to not take meds if you don't really need them."
psychopath,fqmzp5v,t1_fqm58j0,1589486223.0,"I'm willing to try but currently I'm recovering from the meds, in probs a few months I should be able to do it but I'm gonna try and write a paper on how to achieve this. Its some kind of mix between religion and science. Everything I've seen in anything that resembles science seems to match up with it, along with the essence of pretty much every religion.

It might sound retarded to say it like this but ever realised that if other people can be easily brainwashed to the point where they put on a bombing jacket and blow themselves up while running in a stadium, or where people can feel the grace of god and cry for days on end because they felt god and keep feeling him... that you probably could also do it to yourself? Regardless of the fact that you are a psychopath (which LITTERALY implies psycho path, not psycho human)

Its about which path you choose to walk in this world regardless of external factors. This is what makes someone truly happy.

To be honest I could write book upon book upon book about this. But there is no point in it.

I've read things about psychopaths developing manic depressive like conditions after becoming religious, and then going away after they blocked their emotions off.

This definitively seems to imply that psychopaths are able to feel this but they choose to suppress it, together with joy and content. They just drive on pure desire and impulse like some kind of junkie wanting his fix.

I don't mean this in a negative way but its important to realise this, also if you do not belief in god that doesn't mean he doesn't exist, it cannot be proven or disproven which means it is in some kind of 'quantum state' where observation defines reality. Quantum mechanics have an impact on both the future, the past and the present simultaniously.

There is also this statistical thing in which a group of people who guess an answer will approximate the correct answer within 1% after you take the average of all answers. 

Now I also want to point out to you that 70% of the people around the globe are religious (not sure of the exact number but its close to this and not my point)

So with our statistical rule from before this means that god is between 69-71% real.....

You get my point?

It makes no fucking sense, to be honest nothing does. People don't even realise how much shit they in fact don't know. Let alone how much stuff they think they realised that is completely wrong.

I'm not an atheist, I'm not religious.
I just kinda want world peace to be a thing and kept pressing regardless of what people told me.

Anyways about the statistics, it could also be interpretted as well religion is partially right, but there is wrong info in it, and science is even worse.

From a scientific point of view religion has the evolutionary purpose of bringing people together and keep them in group. After a while people started to abuse this because they didn't knew better and made up some crappy rules so they could take control while fucking themselves and all the others over, this catapulted us in a viscious cycle of violence and war that pretty much kept going all of history while all visionaries who actually wanted to do something about it got fucked over.

Its something close to the prisoners dilemma, except that we forget that lying and cheating is actually a really dumb thing to do that eats away at massive amounts of mental energy (all psychopaths ect get tired of acting and smiling)

Anyways I could litteraly keep going about this for days but I'm gonna leave it at this.

If you want to achieve something close to it then follow spirituality (look up buddha or buddhism on wikipedia, don't do the youtube crap... yet..)

Look to be honest there is a scientific explanation for it but I'm pretty sure that this could be an entire scientific field on its own... it can be looked to from a religious, biological, scientific, philosophical, artistical, emotional, mystical, psychological, ... standpoint. 

Looking from it at one way is going to make you wonder wtf is going on, then switching sides is going to make you crazy, but once you find the balance, aka the 'middle' perspective.. then its probably good to go.

You feel like a litteral god lol, the only problem is if you focus on violence ect. You need a 'pure soul' or need to purify it so to speak. After its purified then well... you are going to get from life what you want without even trying. I'm talking about girls just staring at you and saying hi without any obvious reason, talking going automatically, everybody liking you, energy, no need to lie or deceive, no negative shit.

This probably sounds like a dream and well really it kind of is. Idk how the fuck it works but for some fucking weird reason it just works okay, I believe this was the joke all along. God being our subconscious giving us what we think we deserve.

Anyways even if you think its your subconscious the trick is to not say this since your subconscious cannot seperate litteral and figural speech. Aka, if you repeat a lie enough times it will become reality. 

To be honest a world where everyone can just walk around, have sex, eat fucking fruits, trip out in their heads all while we have robots helping us out and a shitload of automation definitively seems a lot better than 2 stupid idiots nagging at each other about which nuclear button is the biggest while iran is also developing nuclear weapons (which will probs be done in idk few months to a few years)

Honestly everyone knows the world is COMPLETELY messed up but once you actually start naming shit they call you a 'psychotic person'. This after you where the smartest kid in the class for ages that got depressed from shitty people and dissapointment after dissapointment after dissapointment.

Then once you completely snap its like yo bitch stfu and take this ritalin u cunt.

Then they ask themselves why you became a criminal and ended up doing a shitload of drugs going to hookers and beating people up. Getting beaten up, getting threatened, threatening people. And then eventually just not giving a fuck.

The only difference between a psychopath and a sociopath to me seems to be that a psychopath experienced his trauma during labor, and a sociopath later in life.

The trauma of a psychopath is probably way deeper since the brain completely develops from this stand point. But neuroplasticity is a thing. You see a sociopath also 'cannot be cured'. Everyone is full of shit and you know it"
psychopath,fqm4eis,t1_fqlrk72,1589471315.0,"I mean fucking around with their true desires, so it kinda ends up with them dissapointed in themselves or me but they are kept hooked so to speak. And all this time I use analogies and figural speak so if at one point their perspective gets challenged, all the words I spoke still fit in the new perspective. 

Some call it psychology, some call it vudu, some call it spirituality, it is also called manipulation, demonic, ...

Truth is that this depends on what its used for and cannot be avoided anyways. We all do it all the time, the only thing we can do is become truly conscious of it.

A psychopath for example has an excelent instinct most other people lack, however other people also have something called empathy. In what I experienced there are 3 types of empathy which is already known and a psychopath has excellent empathy on one of them, cognitive empathy. Which is picking up body language with cognition and then making sense of it, there are 2 other types.

Idk what the exact names of them are but one is where you feel the pain of someone else when they are in pain. Its the most useless kind of empathy there is in my personal opinion and its probably also why psychopaths choose to not feel shit.

Then the 3th type of empathy, this one is amazing. Its actually cognitive and emotional empathy at once, its very rare to experience without drugs I think, especially at full effect. This is what munks and shit aim for.

Once you achieve this state you are 'enlightened'. You pretty much permanently feel like you're on drugs at least that is how I experienced it. It is so profound that a lot of people start going insane thinking they can read minds ect... in fact they sorta can, they have so much empathy that they pretty much know what people think and feel, I mean EXACTLY what they feel and think. This happens when mirror neurons copy everything of the person or something, idk how to explain it.

I was able to give people headaches and confusion so bad that they needed to lie down and close their eyes because they where litteraly going insane and couldn't think straight anymore. I can completely creep people out or get what I want from them, however once I abuse it it dissapears because of internal conflict.

I have made people pretty much lose their mind before, or say shit that hurt them in such a way they just started crying out all those bottled up emotions they didn't even realise they had. It is THAT powerful.

Lost it cuz of antipsychotics braindamage tho, my brain needs some more time to recover from it since I don't feel connected with my true self currently, its only a thin thread"

psychopath,fqlghix,t1_fql9920,1589457436.0,"Well its pretty hard to explain currently, but a real good sumup would be fix actual psychology and realise how it truly works.

Minds can be reprogrammed very easily, in fact everyone is doing it conscious or unconscious.

If we can just teach all people how this works exactly in a simple explanation (which is possible) and which does not use very floaty and religious stuff (which is quite a lot harder but not impossible) all of this can be prevented.

The trick is not in becoming religious, or becoming a science fan (which technically is also a religion) but in merging them. If we look at past events then we can see that the pattern of merging groups of people requires a ritual or a totem. In the current society we don't do this and just merge and expect it to work out, and to ignorant peoples surprise it just doesn't seem to work as it should.

I'm working on this problem by well... not doing anything and thinking about it, I probably sound completely crazy but I know it is possible and I also know it is needed and there is no time to waste.

I also realise that I'm not 'the chosen one' but all of us technically are chosen to spread this message, and its just wether we act on it or not.

I found a new 'mental disorder' you can give anyone. Its something like narcissism and psychopathy together with empathy. And the level of narcissism that can be achieved by this is pretty much so high you feel you are a god. It would completely fall of the scale of what we currently see as narcissism since someone who has a full narcissism score and is actually proud to be one doesn't even come close to this amount of self love ;)

Oh yea the mental disorder also includes permanent euphoria, not a lot of sleep needed (but still needed I think, althrough I could be wrong since there where people before who got a head injury and never needed sleep after that for the rest of their lifes, it would be a risk tho lol), and in its early phases hallucinations which can stay if you want them too, but I'm not sure if that is needed.

I'm keeping it kinda vague in the hopes of keeping the people who read this busy in their mind and maybe open them up to new possibilities.

I've seen things before that hint that it is actually possible and every 'personality disorder' is actually a trauma that is curable.

For a psychopath the trauma is caused by too much serotonin before birth and this desensitised the serotonin receptors responsible for emotion. This does NOT imply incurable, it only implies a heavy form of cptsd. I bet a psychopath pretty much feels like some war veteran who doesn't give a shit anymore."

I however don't go in a full on psychosis, which happened before this while I was on pills (invega).

It turns out that mixing invega and weed causes mayor panic attacks which I perceived as a part of my psychosis, its also described as such in almost all literature about psychosis and it turns out its a side effects of the meds. Idk who or what to believe anymore lol. At first I was litterally thinking about doing a frenzy and stabbing up psychiatrists but then I realised they probably don't even realise it themselves, or not even close to what extent.

So in a way you are more rewarded for extra stimulus, and more likely to seek it out because of the higher reward.

Machine learning logic is much more applicable to a human brain than all the other theories imo. Brains just work in more abstract ways thats why we haven't been able to figure it out yet. So the first step would be getting access to my own internal software so to speak. Then fine tune it. Strange way of saying it but I have no idea how I could otherwise explain it

psychopath,fq95kvi,t1_fq83zdu,1589186362.0,"Well about the autistic people part... they also told me I had autism, so I really differ on that. It also turns out that people with autism actually have really high empathy and sensitivity, but they tend to lock it in their subconscious and walk around like what we call 'autistic'. I'm pretty sure this can be fixed since autism is just a lacking theory of mind, and to me it seems like pretty much everyone is lacking theory of mind. This includes me btw.

Mdma also has great effects on people with autism, and it tends to work a lot stronger on them. This is what I experienced without drugs.

So even if I cannot say for a low functioning person with autism, high functioning autistic people definitively can.

Now I think of it I even helped someone with autism with their parents and they told me my advice was life changing.

All I did was say that they could just gtfo and stop listening whenever they felt completely overloaded.

Things really are as simple as that... and it works.

As to why? No idea I can only make hypothesis, but it seems like we pretty much evolved to cope in these ways.

Remember we evolved from monkeys and we where used to a plant based diet. Monkeys grow really strong and they just eat plants... I bet our diet would be much better on only plants and meat should only be eaten when survival is at stake.

This is a really controversial statement tho so I'm just gonna try stuff out and report my findings.

Currently most of the stuff the doctors, therapists and psychiatrists told me was wrong, so even if I'm not right I won't make shit any worse it seems. I have to carry the consequences of my actions anyways.

About the psychopaths lacking serotonin... the brain is way more complicated than that. You can lack it, or not lack it and be desensitized. There are people who feel depressed without anti depressants and who are manic with antidepressants. This doesn't mean they lack serotonin specifically altrough that is always the story you get. Someone can also be really sensitive to it or really insensitive. 

I believe it is within the control of the body to adapt to this, althrough there will most likely be some physical limitations there is no way to say to what extent.

I've heard of psychopaths becoming 'manic-depressive' after becoming religious and then stopping it and going back to nothing, so this gives a clue to me that sensitivity in psychopaths can also change depending on their beliefs."
psychopath,fq6d2eq,t1_fq5kwag,1589129178.0,"You're right about the psychopath having a different brain, however this is caused by the brain being bathed in serotonin while still in the womb, this causes desensitised serotonin receptors which in turn causes physical changes in the brain and rest of the body.

This doesn't mean its completely irreversible per se, its only going to be a lot harder to do than with a neurotypical.

I see dopamine as a short reward system for the 'I' or what you label as yourself.

Serotonin looks like a reward system for the 'we' to me. I have no way to back this up and this explanation is far from complete but this is what I experienced myself.

A psychopath thus will have problems with thinking about other people since his serotonin is desensitised and dopamine takes over. This changes the brain structure and causes an 'addiction' to risk seeking behaviour, drugs, agressiveness, ...

A psychopath gets a much bigger reward from it and any punishment to them seems to make it worse.

So the only option would be to reward them for it, our brains can do this ourselves and every human is wired to do this. In a psychopath however these brain areas are dormant. This is not equal to non-existant. They are desensitised. My hypothesis would be that if a psychopath willingly refrains from addictions, tries to be empathic, tries to convert his anger/rage to a caring understanding way he could (partially) regain this.
Eating only plants and drinking water also stimulates this by enormous amounts and is already scientifically proven altrough they don't have any idea on why tho as far as I know.

I'm more looking at where other people are wrong than where I am right since I don't know all the answers and well... my brain got fried... I bet that within this and a year I'll figure a lot of this out, anyways I'm currently pretty much running from the psychiatrist cuz fuck them, those pieces of shit don't listen to a single word you're saying if they already have preconceived notions on the topic.

I definitively beg to differ on psychopaths, sociopaths however... not sure. There is a whole lot I'm not sure about to be honest, its amazing to try and find out."
psychopath,fq5j9qu,t1_fq5hymr,1589107548.0,"You see, I also am not sure of it, I'm just stating my experience with this. It might not be a correct explanation but I'm working on that. I had my brain fried by antipsychotics and had no empathy or emotions whatsoever, however they are slowly comming back since I'm training it. The brain is neuroplastic, you can become whoever you want in your mind regardless of brain chemicals or imbalances, everyone has these... its getting rid of them that will cause you to function better but this is not possible to achieve if you already settled for what you have.

Before this I was able to experience mdma like highs without drugs. A psychiatrist or therapist would call it a 'mania' however I was not wreckless, I was very kind and empathic with more emotions than I ever imagined possible. I took the antipsychotics because my parents where worried for the crying and I didn't think too much of it until I started getting headaches, felt litteral short cirquits and frying in my brain, and emotions faded while leaving me very upset and angry.

The amounts of empathy I experienced where unbelievable and I didn't even know it was possible without drugs. It was just caused by my way of thinking and my subconscious being able to fully focus. It was like my consciousness moved from my personality part of my brain to my full brain. Probably sounds very floaty but no other way to explain it, I saw so much possibilities and could channel my emotions by thinking in specific ways. The meds ruined this but I read online that after about 3 months it will mostly recover. After the meds I started getting muscle twitches, mixing up words or 'word salad' hearing voices. This was not before the meds. 

I'm currently questioning the entire thing we call 'reality'

Call me a philosopher, a schizophrenic, a sociopath, a narcissist, a psycho. I look beyond the labels.

It shows more about the journey of their lifes and their ancestors than about the person himself or his 'soul' if you will. Generational trauma is only an unproven theory and yet they see psychopathic genes will flourish in violent areas or war areas.. its not only about a person but also the history of their ancestors.

We're underevolved apes....

Litteraly a monkey can easily beat anyone at some really basic strategy games after some training... yet their brains are less dense? Less able to do shit? I see it as only fooling ourselves since we all come from apes and other animals. We ourselves are still animals, so we share the same instincts, emotions, needs...

They can be more or less prominent depending on how the environment is, but deep down we're all human and have roughly the same abilities. There is just a lot of diversity depending on gene expressions which make some features stand out more or less. This doesn't mean they are completely gone.

We've all lost touch with ourselves, not only people with aspd, sociopathy, or psychopaths. The only people who haven't live in bushes in the amazon and are running for large industries who are burning that shit down....

Traditions and religions can be very helpful and interesting. Sticking to 1 well... definitely isn't gonna serve you optimally."
psychopath,fq5gf1w,t1_fq5fjco,1589104417.0,"I understand, I experienced it myself. You can also litteraly rewire your brain in a way that serves you even better, while also serving others better. Empathy can be a strength or a burden depending on your perspective, if you choose not to use mirror neurons because they are naturally underdeveloped yes you can do this and it will work great. However you're not running on full potential. A psychopath for example is really desensitised and yet sometimes they cry and then think it was fake. Its a bypass of this part of the brain. There is nothing preventing you from removing the bypass except yourself. This doesn't mean its easy tho. 

I agree with your point of view in many ways, and I experienced a total loss of empathy myself too. I didn't feel fear, not even anger even. Litterally no emotions.... 

Its not that because you do not feel empathically challenged that you aren't. A psychopath however completely isn't. Even they I'm sure can rewire this to some extent. How much this is? Idk. There is a lot more about this I don't know than that I do.

I only know science is full of shit and have noticed this myself, so don't be limited by it. In many ways science is right but they overlook many things. Subconsciously you still judge yourself for it, and this burden is anyones who acts like this to carry and its possible to not even realise this especially if you've never experienced it differently. This doesn't boil down to 'incurable'

However why would they want to cure something that messes with other people and in turn brings in money? 

Anyways I'm gonna leave it at this.

Even therapists think im crazy, yet I was able to fix my problems and they couldn't help me because they where stuck in this linear line of thinking."
psychopath,fq5f3gj,t1_fq5erm3,1589102962.0,"Im pretty sure it can be cure, science is full of shit and they don't realise the extent of their own ignorance. There is something called neuroplasticity. Brains are NOT fixed and any scientist who tells you its an incurable 'disorder' is full of shit and doesn't understand anything about what he's talking about. He's just copying information he has been thought without any real error checks. Anyone can reinvent themselves, even though probably not to the 'norms' of society which are full of shit and a psychopath or sociopath despises. I do to, and I am nowhere near a psychopath. I'm one of the most kind hearted people there is and one could say I'm a sociopath. Yet I barely have anger issues, sometimes I go mental and turn into this completely narcissistic fuck for self preservation. Never however will I hurt someone just to 'get back at them'. I try to teach people, talked with criminals who threatened to kill me and got them to cry and shit like that. Science is full of shit my friend, religion also is. And in both there is a truth."
psychopath,fq5e1wy,t1_fq5dtci,1589101817.0,"I mean that the brain is pretty much a computer. Say shit to it many times and it will happen and become truth. This is what cultures do, and hardly anyone looks further than their own culture. If you want to trip out and see magical immagery thats possible. If you want to become a very likable person thats also possible. Its about writing the right 'mindset' or program for your body. Meditation, controlling thoughts, channeling emotions. It prevents you from getting angry and getting a real edge at other people. If you lie you waste brainpower on covering up the lies so its very inefficient. If you get offended by something it is you who got offended. Its about channeling the emotions and thoughts. Getting a different perspective."
psychopath,fq5dhve,t1_fq5clqv,1589101217.0,"Yes, almost all people are fake. Running their cultural program full of shit. NTs also do horrible things they however believe it is 'normal' and they are 'entitled' to it. Which would pretty much classify society as a whole as ASPD. So at least ur straight up about it lmao. Other people cling on their ego and see themselves as inherently good without walking the same walk."
psychopath,fq5c8lz,t1_fq5b9j5,1589099881.0,"Well, people do the same things as psychopaths...
They just don't realise it themselves...
A psychopath is usually much more extreme and well... less irrational than a neurotypical. They can still be very irrational however depending on your point of view."
psychopath,fq5ap9m,t1_fq5ah4f,1589098283.0,"Yes a lot of them would. Its not watertight however.

I personally fit in many labels. I am however none of them.

And yes exactly, a psychopath doesn't have to be full of shit but people expect them too."
