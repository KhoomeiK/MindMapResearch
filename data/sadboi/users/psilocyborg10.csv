BipolarSOs,fm9r90c,t3_ftpbg6,1585874766.0,"It’s scary how much I related to this. Same-ish thing happened with my (30f) bipolar husband (30m).. and I can tell you the first thing that jumped out at me in your story is that you are so used to this type of behavior that you didn’t call emergency services immediately when he started acting like he was gonna kill himself. I’ve been there too— the trauma and drama from him is so normalized that you literally thought you could go back to work for a bit and then talk to him after. Just no. It tells of an extreme lack of boundaries and manipulation to the point he has completely pulled you in. When I finally started working with a therapist they were shocked at how normalized suicidal threats were in my relationship too. They strongly urged me to have a strong boundary that *every single time* he makes a serious *threat* about suicide, I have to call mobile crisis or 911. Keep in mind this is different from someone opening up about honest feelings they’ve been having. Because at this point they are escalated and using it as a threat. 

I agree with everyone that it’s abuse. I can tell you from my own experience that once I finally did set up those boundaries, they worked for a bit but he just found other ways to be emotionally abusive."

etiquette,fjky61a,t1_fjkgsgd,1583436228.0,"My husband is unfortunately not very helpful. He does feel the same way and tells me it bothers him when his parents do things like this, but kind of just allows it to happen because “that’s just how they are”. In the past when he has been in charge of communicating things to them, he won’t actually follow through with being assertive. Anyway, besides the boundary issues, my MIL and I are close enough that I prefer to be direct with her rather than leave it to chance that a miscommunication could occur.

I’m not sure why my MIL does it to be honest. Sometimes it definitely comes off as controlling (like when she drops off food to my son that she knows I expressly do not allow him to have). Other times I think she is just anxious on our behalf about money and is trying to be kind. In this case, I’m not sure. She knew it was my gift idea that I had plans for, so it felt kind of icky for her to swoop in and get it before I could. But maybe her intentions were good, they’re just not wanted."

It means that I do not want her swooping in to pay for things on my behalf without my consent. There are an abundance of other gifts she is welcome to give my son.

relationship_advice,ez94xm5,t3_d0fsji,1567773087.0,"Well, did you stick up for her or did you not? Gotta be honest, this feels like a really one-sided perspective on what happened. You left out details so I’m going to read between the lines a bit, please take my advice with a grain of salt as I may be assuming some things based on common patterns I see with couples and in-laws.

Your wife is telling you she doesn’t feel comfortable moving in with your parents. Whether she said it was okay before, she’s having second thoughts. Her reasons she stated are valid and in addition I think the underlying problem is she just doesn’t have a good relationship with them, despite what you “thought”. 

I will say that unless you have been in this exact situation, you don’t know how this feels. Moving in with your parents is going to be a lot easier for you than it is for your wife. She will have to sacrifice some of her independence, especially if your parents are busy-body types. Based on your age I’m assuming you were recently married, so she is navigating trying to build a life with you while also dealing with being under their roof, people she doesn’t even feel comfortable around, feels walked on by, and whatever else is going on. If she doesn’t feel like you’re sticking up for her, she also feels like she’s doing this all alone, 1 against 3, basically being the black sheep in the household. It’s really not fun in any way. 

Instead of blowing the argument out of proportion, just try to listen to her and understand where she is coming from— a much different place from where you’re standing. If moving somewhere else is truly out of the question, talk about what sorts of boundaries you can help set with parents and how to support her. I do think it’s your responsibility to help her feel as welcome to the family and supported in this as possible."

I’m so sorry for everything you’ve been through. It sounds like a horrible ordeal. Honestly, your ex sounds like she had borderline personality disorder or something.

Jeesh some of you guys must throw the worst parties. “Come over my house for hours please! Oh, why didn’t you know to bring your own food, toilet paper, and chair? That should be your responsibility because you’re an independent person, right?” 

This is really basic etiquette across all cultures. It’s ok to break etiquette sometimes when you communicate “btw I don’t have much to eat and already did, but feel free to bring whatever you need!” But he didn’t even think to do any of that until she was already starving in his dark living room and she was forced to bring it up *again* herself.

BPDlovedones,exj562j,t3_ct1qtj,1566342220.0,"I have too many to really choose the most extreme but the most bizarre was when he tried to convince me he never explicitly instructed me to get a dog for our sons Christmas present. It was a weeks-long, complex process of researching breeds, looking for dogs, calling up/visiting shelters and breeders, and coming up with a gift presentation idea. I checked in with him every step of the way and even tried talking him out of the idea at the beginning because I was skeptical he had as much money to spare as he kept saying. But we all really wanted a dog and had the space/time to finally do it. 

I finally found a puppy we both adored and in his price range. I even visited and bonded with it! The people selling him held the dog for us. The day that he was supposed to send the deposit in, less than a week before Christmas, he told me it was a bad idea and he never told me to do all these things or agreed to it. Which was a complete lie. Told me he would never make such a ridiculous suggestion or go along with it, and obviously I should know better than expect him to pay out for such a dumb thing. Acted like I was just being a bitch and treating him like a checkbook for frivolous purchases. 

The reality: Less than 24 hours prior he was enthusiastically telling me to confirm with the breeder we had connected with. And had been instructing me to do all these steps the whole entire time, and was in fact the one to introduce the idea of a getting the dog for a Xmas gift.

He didn’t seem to understand why telling me 6 days before Christmas (and with only one night left where I could go shopping) that I no longer had a big gift lined up for our son was a dick move.

P.S. he did finally admit that he was the one who told me to get a dog. Because luckily at that point I was learning more about what gaslighting is and called him out on it *immediately*. And I had some evidence to back it up. He tried changing the subject and blowing up on me but I kept bringing it back to getting him to tell the truth. It hurts to think of all the times he has successfully gaslit me that I probably don’t even realize."

BipolarSOs,ew65fv8,t3_cn099x,1565154662.0,"It might be a good idea to preemptively make a plan in case of crisis. It is especially important now that a baby is in the home. One thing to note is that BP people sometimes cannot recognize when they are not stable enough to parent and will get very defensive when you rightly step in. It would be a good idea to establish that you are the primary caretaker in case of him displaying erratic behavior and that it will be up to your discretion to determine whether or not he is stable enough to be parenting. Of course do this with him and talk it over, when he is in a clear state of mind."
BPDlovedones,ew5mwlw,t1_ew5ksvh,1565140128.0,"Exactly! So spot on. There was this one man there at the space I’m familiar with who was incredibly kind and devoted to various projects including improving the community space. He was so accepting of everyone and just wanted best for all. And of course he became so vulnerable to BPD fuckery because of it. This probably BPD lady accused him of being a rapist and broadcast it to everyone. 

Now, I am all about bringing awareness to women’s rights and rape culture. And indeed it’s important to point out problematic behavior. But I would never publicly accuse a man of rape just because he asked a few times while making out, and then I consented. That’s not rape. At absolute worst it’s being slightly pushy, but by all accounts it didn’t even seem like that. After hearing details from both sides it just seemed so absurd. And after being accused this guy even went so far as to attend group meetings to try to learn more about why asking multiple times can be seen as coercion (even though he used no physical or verbal force, waited for clear consent, etc). Even after accepting responsibility, taking steps to educate himself, and sincerely apologizing, he was branded a rapist and she drove him away from the organization. Like literally would yell rapist at him as he walked by. FOR ASKING TO HAVE SEX MORE THAN ONCE WHILE BOTH WERE ENTHUSIASTICALLY MAKING OUT AND THEN WAITING FOR CONSENT BEFORE PROCEEDING. it was just literally insane. And as a female makes me angry because this is the type of stuff that discredits legitimate work towards addressing rape culture.

Sorry for the side rant but it just fits in so precisely with your observations."

I peripherally witnessed an entire organization go under in less than 4 months after this woman took over.

These were good, kind-hearted people who communicated. But she had already decided they were evil and needed to be eradicated."

I’m so grateful to have a word for it though. Most people aren’t familiar with the term and don’t understand how harmful covert incest can be. So take care not to listen too much to someone who may minimize what you went through. I always knew there was something off with my stepdad but couldn’t place what it was and it really messed up my self esteem. I thought I was ungrateful and couldn’t trust my own feelings for too many years. But just because the abuse never escalated to physical penetration or genital stimulation doesn’t mean it did not effect you. I’m happy for you though that you have taken a step towards understanding yourself and healing <3"

And now she finally has some power dangled in front of her and it’s ripped away again. The pain must be intolerable.

I think watching her take out her anger on the only person she really can get away with now— another handmaid— is genius. It really just goes to show how helpless these handmaids are that they end up abusing each other just as they have been abused."

I can’t wait to hear the defense on part 2, though. I think this girl truly was sick in the mind and the psychiatrist is doing a good job painting a picture of how warped her thinking was.

And I know it’s hard, because you have seen so many times what the relationship *could* be through little glimpses here and there. But those glimpses are not the whole picture. You should see a therapist who can help you figure out why you are so attached to someone who is terrible for your physical, mental, and emotional health.

I totally get where you’re coming from about some of his name choices but it kind of sounds like you are also being unreasonable and unwilling to compromise. In your post you seem to be focusing on arguably his worst name preferences, when it sounds like there’s actually a couple of normal ones in there. Instead of focusing on slamming his name choices, and acting like yours are obviously better, you both need to just keep searching for one that’s agreeable to both. There IS a name out there you both will be okay with. And no, you don’t get any kind of special say in baby’s naming. It’s a decision you have to arrive to together, much like all future parenting decisions for your baby’s entire upbringing."

His upbringing seems pretty normal from the outside. However I know that when he was little, his father left the family for a year. He didn’t remember this until his mom recently told him. And his father in general is just kind of a very hands-off parent. He tells me he remembers being young and filled with hatred for his dad. They have a pretty good relationship now in adulthood, though. To me this still sounds like the type of trauma that could trigger bpd, but I’m not sure."

mentalhealth,erwzoqq,t3_c4i02g,1561364063.0,"I have a mobile crisis service in my area for urgent mental health needs. There are two separate services— one for children and one for adults. You can call anytime and a clinician will come out to your home or meet you at one of their office locations to evaluate you. Just used it with my husband for the first time the other day. Although the wait times were frustrating, they were so helpful once they were actually here. They helped stabilize my husband and were able to come up with other resources for us to access in case of crisis that his therapist/psychiatrist haven’t even suggested. They do require consent to see the person experiencing the emergency. But they will also come just to talk to overwhelmed family members as well. 

I think this service is amazing and I wish it were available everywhere."

domesticviolence,errjsc8,t1_err6x12,1561172723.0,"Thank you so much for your really thoughtful response. It really feels like you get it and I agree I need to put myself and my kid first. it gives me hope that you were able to find a better life for yourself. I realized over the winter that my willingness to leave this situation is the only think that motivates him to get help. Im getting better at sticking up for myself. I still regularly look up apartments just in case and he knows if he touches me like that ever again I will be gone.

For more context, I should have mentioned though that he has not been physically abusive since his arrest about 8 months ago. 4 months of that we were separated. He has been hospitalized and sees a therapist and psychiatrist. And I also see a therapist now. But he does continue to be emotionally/verbally abusive, which is probably the most painful part to deal with. I can’t even describe the suffering it causes. And none of the people I tell really seem to get it. They just don’t ask questions I guess so I don’t go into detail.

He’s been making steady progress, though. First with not getting physical, then with not threatening to get physical, then with not breaking things. Right now I am trying to set a boundary with him about not threatening suicide. From there I hope to work on the yelling/insulting/swearing. And maybe if he can do all those things I can finally work on healing, building trust back up, etc. I’m thankful that in my area we have a lot of resources and we actually had an on-call clinician come out to meet us today at home, as he has been angry and suicidal all week. It’s horrible because his normal self is very caring and supportive. When I realize he is having an episode, it’s like never knowing if you will see the person you love again.

Thank you again for your comment!"

tifu,er6q9n7,t1_er5dykr,1560554175.0,"Dude I have another cringey story of fucking up in a very similar way. I had a best friend in middle school and for years we were best friends. She did something really hurtful in the beginning of high school and I basically grew apart as a result. Not like I was unfriending her, but just stopped hanging out. It was really hard for me because I loved this girl but i was too hurt that she never even apologized after I told her how I felt. 

Well, about two years go by and I’m cleaning out my closet. There’s a gift bag from a birthday present I remember her giving me around our falling out. I did open most of it at the time, but it was random trinkets that she found around her house. Like her grandmas old dirty earrings and stuff like that. I remember at the time I was like, well this is nice of her I guess but it literally seems like she just last minute walked around her house grabbing whatever item she could find. And I was a little offended. So I didn’t completely finish opening it as it looked like more of the same. 

I start going through it after finding it and lo and behold, there was a long handwritten letter stuck to the bottom of the bag. She basically poured her heart out telling me how much I meant to her and how sorry she was. She asked me to respond to her letter if I was willing to forgive her. But I never saw it so I never did. AND I TOTALLY WOULD HAVE!! I just cried when I read the letter and never reached out to tell her I finally found it."
