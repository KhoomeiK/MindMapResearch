BipolarReddit,fhx9mwf,t1_fhx2yb4,1581948844.0,"Same here. I find showering so exhausting, it’s usually when I can smell the funk that I tell myself “You stink! Take a fucking shower!” Finally, I just do it. Then I feel so much better. One thing that has helped is cutting my hair shorter. Much easier to wash, dry, style. 

Another thing that can make showering so exhausting to think about, is that as a woman, I feel pressured to “get ready” after showering: the hair, the makeup, etc. 
Let that shit go. Unless it makes you feel more confident or better about yourself. 

Don’t feel bad about not wanting or feeling like taking a shower. It’s okay. I think we’ve all been there. Maybe talk to your pdoc about it. A med adjustment could help.

Wishing you the best and sending good vibes your way. 💜"

bipolar2,fhx7kni,t3_f4z1ir,1581947133.0,"Some days I just hate everyone and get angry about every little thing - and feel like punching someone or something. It doesn’t happen often - and it’s so out of character for me.

Other times I just want to tell everyone to fuck off and leave me the fuck alone; stay in my own little shell, and avoid everyone.

And then there’s the hypomania - which I’m currently experiencing. So many IDEAS, for so many things! Notebooks filled with copious lists, ideas for making money/starting a business - or some other random stuff.  Aarrghhh. 🤪

Maybe part of pushing people away is that for the most part, they just don’t get it. Not that they don’t want to help. My husband is very supportive but I just can’t talk to him - most of the time. I feel better communicating here, because everyone here “gets” it.

Ok, what was the question?

Scientology is all about control and manipulation - and getting your money once they’ve gotten you on board. It’s a cult. They know that the psychiatric professionals will reveal it as such. Thus they do what they can to discredit them.

Katy Holmes joined Scientology after marrying Tom Cruise (he required it), until her father (a psychiatrist) helped her see it for what it is - a manipulative cult out to suck you in and take your money.

Google Scientology- there are several documentaries about them. They definitely need to be stopped, but they have grown into a mega movement and have “churches” all over the world. They also rake in the money by claiming nonprofit status because they are a “religion”.

My premium is about $170 per month and so worth it! There are plans that are much cheaper but have more restrictions, copays and annual out of pocket costs. I don’t see how anyone can afford insurance.

Of course, everyone responds differently to medications, so it may or may not help you. Have you been on it before? I take 50 mg twice a day (100 mg total).

It’s basically to see if you have sleep apnea, which causes a person to wake up off and on throughout the night because their heart stops beating and they stop breathing, then suddenly they awake, gasp for air and start breathing again. 

Soooo if you find yourself waking up throughout the night, it might help to get checked for it, but if you just can’t fall asleep or stay asleep (insomnia), it may not be beneficial. 

But I’m not a doctor, so that decision is up to you. Maybe discuss it with your doctor first and be as detailed as you can about your sleep issues. Good luck!

I had originally seen her to get a referral to a psychiatrist, which she agreed to do, but told me it would likely be months before I would be able to get an appointment.
She said that most psychiatrists have a waitlist and because of that, many primary care docs are picking up the slack, and are knowledgeable about mood disorders and how to treat them. 

TL:DR: Just make an appointment and discuss your symptoms and diagnosis and you should be able to get a prescription.

And last but not least, I get urges to just run away to another city or state and start over - that things will be better if I do.
Now for bipolar 2, you don’t have to exhibit all these symptoms (these are considered “hypomanic”) to be considered as bipolar 2.
The disorder usually includes periods of depression, and sometimes “mixed” episodes of both.

bipolar2,ezlheyj,t3_d1fwn9,1567976763.0,"Don’t do it. Just call and quit. Don’t go. I once answered an ad for a “sex model” out of desperation. There was no modeling. It was borderline prostitution.  They took photos of the “girls” semi-nude, and then let “clients” picked which girl they wanted. Then the two would go into a tiny room with a tiny bed and the client was allowed to certain types of touching to the “model” and he was allowed to masterbate - which he did. We were told not to allow intercourse and that blow jobs weren’t allowed. 
While waiting for a client, I heard stories from model “regulars” - like one guy who liked to put a thermometer up a girls ass - and other weird stuff.
After about two hours, a client picked me. To say it was creepy is an understatement.  Basically, he felt me up, jacked off, then left. I left after that and never went back - not even to collect what little they owed me,
You’d be better off working as a waitress - or anything else. I had also heard that the place was raided often and would have undercover cops come in and pretend to be clients to see how far they could get a girl to go, then bust them for prostitution.
So please, forget about this “job.”  You are better than that. Everyone on this forum cares about you and wants the best for you. Take care. I wish you the absolute best! Love and hugs. ❤️"
