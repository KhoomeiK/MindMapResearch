ebay - easy, quick, takes the most fees, lots of extra features
discogs - also easy and quick, plus items can sell faster due to people simply checking the page for records theyre interested in buying. also takes a lesser amount of money than ebay

should probably be a touch more specific. would keeping the record in a MOFI sleeve, inside the PVC sleeve simply slow down the process? or stop it entirely? im doing this with a limited record that i care a ton about, so it's a case of :the less damage, the better:."

lewronggeneration,fqgn89p,t1_fqglz0i,1589350972.0,"sorry but it rly sounds like u aren't lookin hard enough. local bands are still an extremely large part of the music scene, and music is just as personal as it seems it was back then. (plus being able to put your music on sites like bandcamp and get popularity from word of mouth is a how a lot of people find smaller bands. ive found tons of my favorite music from just looking around and getting curious or hearing about it from someone else) with stuff like record collecting nearing an all time high, cassettes making a comeback, and older formats resurfacing such as minidisc, people can have a massive connection with the music they listen to and enjoy. this isn't even mentioning the amount of smaller labels that focus on specific genres and bring smaller artists to light. on the surface, music seems almost bland and nearly meaningless compared to the way music was experienced by people decades ago, but there's a LOT of depth under that lil skin layer that people are missing out on.

also to counter your inconvenience point: music might be more readily available on a basic level, but since people are collecting more records now, it can still be a pain in the ass to get certain albums you love physically. lots of music on smaller, independent labels isn't pressed in any physical way, and the boom of limited editions of certain albums on formats like vinyl can make collecting difficult and expensive. same with something like listening to music on the radio vs owning a copy of said album back then; while one is decent in a vacuum, being able to experience your favorite music on a physical format with extra art and information can make you appreciate your favorite music in a whole new way. //this turned into a bigass ramble wow"

the katamari damacy soundtrack. i prefer the first pressings more, but being tardy to the party left me with the (still very nice) third pressing

brockhamptons ginger. i was super on the fence about this when i saw it go up for sale, but im really happy i went through with it and got a copy

the first glass beach album by glass beach probably has some of my favorite packaging out of my entire collection. great art and extra notes and information on the jacket, really nice printed sleeves, great sounding records, and a big ol 24*24 poster of the album art.
