Blepharitis,fnmkip4,t3_fugtwv,1587073080.0,"Idk, I had a chalazion so bad my entire eye was swollen shut for a day, I took antibiotics for it but it left a large permanent bump. 

I eventually got it cut open and squeezed out but that only helped about 50%. I'm back on antibiotics, doing warm compresses and as per the opthamologists recommendation using a bit of hydrocortisone gel on it nightly. Almost been a year now, since the initial chalazion and it is still present. Not sure it'll recover much more, such is the story of my life."
depression,fncsb9u,t3_g0s1ms,1586845585.0,"They suck though, been on 9 different ones. At best they, help for anxiety in my experience. 

In general, I feel more apathetic on them, end up with a weak erection and a very difficult time being able to orgasm (this is annoying as FUCK). I've also had some make me super sleepy and a couple give me severe dry mouth.

Overall, they were a complete waste of time, money and added a fuck ton of extra stress."

SebDerm,fncpj20,t3_g0berq,1586843106.0,"It works but only temporarily. If you stop the diet or are prone to cheating on it and not in long term ketosis it will likely not work.

It has it's own host of problems, like extreme weight loss, no appetite, it's hard to eat enough calories without carbs and expensive. I'm an ectomorph construction worker so it's fucking hard as fuck to maintain my weight. I don't have the luxury of eating grass fed ribeyes all day and downing fat makes me feel sick. 

I also need to supplement, sodium, potassium, and magnesium daily or i'll be extremely fatigued, get twitchy eyelids, calf cramps and feel lightheaded etc. 

Keto and zero carb are awesome but i've grown to hate them to be honest. If I was overweight, a smaller person and had an inactive lifestyle i'd love it but for me it's torture tbh. I end up wasting away after a few months every time."
SebDerm,fncoyr6,t3_g0re9t,1586842638.0,"It along with rosacea, ocular rosacea, folliculits on my body and balding effectively ruined my life. 20 years on i'm still struggling with my health and losing, only guilt has kept me alive. 

Had a gf, captain of my soccer team, honor roll student, overall happy kid at 12 by 13 I was absolutely fucked...fml, life can be ruthless and cruel."
Folliculitis,fncje8z,t3_fwwqvw,1586838266.0,"The one problem with the keto diet, is fatigue and too much weight loss. It works well for my skin but horrible for my job (construction). If I had a desk job, it would be 1000x better...fml. I've tried to add 'healthy carbs' so many times but it never works, I have to be in ketosis for any benefit. 

I've been on and off the keto diet over 10 times since 2011, EVERYTIME it clears up my skin 95%, like accutane does. It always comes back of course, so it's just a management technique.

My stomach can't handle more than 2500kcal on keto without feeling gross, or having digestive issues, so I always end up withering away with my job."

Folliculitis,fmn9qbw,t1_fmkhr7x,1586221200.0,More of a temporary fix in my case. Are you clear forever from a round of accutane or are you permanently on a low dose to keep it at bay?

Dying on the streets, albeit sad and frightening, doesn't really bother me anymore to be honest. I've accepted all the terrible fates that can befall a human."
