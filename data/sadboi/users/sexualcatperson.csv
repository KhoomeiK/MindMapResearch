You also almost killed his child along with yourself. That's terrifying and it probably broke him.

Are you seeing a therapist weekly and a psych doctor monthly during your pregnancy? You need to be well monitored during this. It may be a good idea to check yourself into a psych unit for a few days until you are stable. If you went off your meds, go right back on.

If you show good effort, you may be able to turn this around. Couples counseling is a must as well because he needs to be able to express the complicated feelings he is going through during this time.

It's really easy to turn this into ""me,me,me"" during pregnancy and being mentally ill. I'm guilty of it as well but we all need to realize the toll we take on others around us and how not fair it is to blame them when **we** finally break things so badly they can't take it anymore.

As for taking the baby, that's not how it works. If you are mentally unstable, obviously the baby should go with him but no judge is going to separate a newborn from the mother, especially if you are breastfeeding. There's a whole long process for custody and he's not going to just be able to walk out of the hospital with your baby. If you guys aren't together, don't even allow him entry if you're that worried. It's your medical procedure.

There are a lot of people happy to foster and adopt right now, so letting your second cat go is probably the smart answer. 

It seems like your cats were/are having some pretty normal issues but you aren't able to fix it, so you let someone better equipped do it. 

Perhaps limit the amount of pets you have in the future though. You need to be able to handle the amount you have both in times of good and in times of stress."
