And to assume that you, a black woman, wouls choose to look like an oversexed halloween character shows his feelings towards black women which the world views as hypersexual(just a thought idk).

But whats worse than everything else? his ability to play ping pong with your argument and turn everything on you and actively invalidate your position on this matter.

But ive seen this before, he doesnt want you to feel good about yourself because having a girl that has confidence and self love threatens him because he wants to be the one responsible for building you up. He wants your confidence in his hands as a form of control so that if he needs to he can easily tear you down....in my opinion.

Its a tactic to make sure you feel small and would never leave him if ever you think he's not good enough for you. This is also a reflection of his own very low self esteem. It's all projection and he's being a typical abusive male and wanting to take ownership of a woman while simultaneously building himself up....in my opinion.
