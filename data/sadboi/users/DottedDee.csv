Why would Black Spider stop at 4 categories and not include ""spider""? Parrot IS a bird and so could fill a Bird slot.

And what is this altar everyone keeps talking about? I made a church. 

A unicorn can totally be classified as horse; it's a mythical horse!"

helpme,fqaaew1,t3_ghll7u,1589215668.0,"I feel you. I held my negative feelings and thoughts inside because often others seem to be going through things that seem reasonable to depress them while I'm not going through anything but just get down sometimes... for a long time. I have highs as well, having fun with students and friends online, and then I'm alone and hating myself again in the quiet, but I'd feel like my pain wasn't legitimate enough to take up a hotline agent when they could be helping someone with more substantial evidence of depression than me. 

I remind myself that any thoughts and feelings about suicide are worth talking about with someone though. Those thoughts want to stay in the dark to drag you down further into the darkness, so you've got to combat it with the light of truthful sharing, no matter the fears of the results. 

Thank you for sharing with us."
