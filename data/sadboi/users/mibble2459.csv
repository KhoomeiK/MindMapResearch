RandomKindness,fd655f9,t1_fd62yqf,1578185669.0,"Also it’s important to express your feelings. If you’re upset with someone, let them know because nobody can read your mind and it’s not worth the emotional toll to bottle it up inside. It’s best to work things out

And talking about your feelings, even online, really takes a load off so don’t let your negative emotions pile up until you can’t take it anymore."

RandomKindness,fd62yqf,t3_ek0i8i,1578184827.0,"This is a lovely idea! My name is Lauren I’m 16 from NY

My advice is to put yourself first. Do what you can to help others, but not if it physically or mentally harms yourself. Set your boundaries and it’s ok to say no if something makes you uncomfortable. Prioritize your mental health along with your physical health because it’s just as important(:

Also stay open minded and give people the benefit of the doubt, that includes yourself."
