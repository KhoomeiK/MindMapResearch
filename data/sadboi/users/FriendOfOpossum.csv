tarot,f8tym5e,t1_f8t7o27,1574814541.0,"For multiple-card spreads, I'd really recommend looking for spreads that you connect with? At least that's what has worked for me, searching for some general type of spread like ""month ahead tarot spread"" or something, and then when I find one that I can read the set meanings and think ""yeah, i could do that!"" that's when I'm able to get to work. One spread that's really good for overall readings is the Celtic Cross Spread, but that can be a lot to handle sometimes. I'd recommend just practicing a lot and if you feel like it would help you maybe joining a discord server or a facebook group or something to get help with particularly difficult card combinations you might get! Good luck!"
tarot,f8tya75,t1_f8sy3m7,1574814295.0,"A lot of people believe differently. Some people look as a deck as just a deck, yeah. Personally, I feel like I can get readings out easier when I connect with my deck, but I don't think it's impossible to get accurate readings out of a deck that you don't connect with! That being said, if you're feeling a strong \*dis\*connect from your deck, that's more likely to put a mental block in the way of getting readings out of it. I'd really recommend finding a deck you do connect with if you have the chance."

And then usually I'll refamiliarize myself with the deck by going through the cards ""in order."" And then for me, boom, they're cleansed. It's really up to you how you want to go about cleansing your deck. Some people even just kind of knock on their deck three times as a means of cleansing. You've got this!"
bipolar,f7npcka,t1_f7nhgmb,1573912469.0,"Mine are just bizarre and totally random. One time I literally just heard someone whisper ‚ÄúGayyyy‚Äù into my ear while I was in my room alone.

Like I‚Äôm choosing food for myself and she‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI want taco bell‚Äù and I‚Äôm like that‚Äôs great but you don‚Äôt get a vote. Another time I saw a horse on a freeway, which I assume was a hallucination because wouldn‚Äôt other people react to that? Like he was ON the FREEWAY that‚Äôs dangerous!!

Sometimes my hallucinations are more ‚Äútypical‚Äù I guess: bugs crawling all over me, shadow people, etc. But most of the time it‚Äôs just bizarre shit."

Like usually when I'm depressed and want to die I'm tired enough that I can just go to sleep and wake up with the feeling manageable again, but with this nonsense I'm sleeping max 3 hours a night so I'm having to figure out coping skills that include being awake. It's a nightmare. I've also been having some hallucinations but they're super atypical and that's frustrating, it's really funny that they confuse my psychiatrist at least as much as they confuse me though. Before last night I didn't really realize that I was experiencing symptoms of mania and now looking back over my past 2 weeks it makes sense but I'm like mad at myself for not noticing sooner. Could have saved a lot of money and started fewer projects that I'm almost certainly going to give up on once my mood shifts again. But who the hell knows when that will be? Definitely not me."

Like ‚ÄúHey I know I said I liked you but that was before I found out you were a guy, and I‚Äôm not gay so I gotta retract the earlier statement‚Äù or possibly ‚ÄúHey when I said I liked you I didn‚Äôt know you were a guy and I‚Äôm not gay or haven‚Äôt previously considered myself to be attracted to the same gender but if you‚Äôre willing to deal with my confusion with my own labels I‚Äôd still really like to go on a date with you to see how things might work.‚Äù But yeah that depends on how you‚Äôre really feeling and whatnot.

I'm really glad you were able to find a couple of decks that you like and I hope you connect with them well. I wanted to suggest to you the Numinous Tarot by Noel Arthur Heimpel, if you google it you can see all the cards. They're gorgeous. It's personally my favorite deck.

If the fight‚Äôs y‚Äôall had been having were based in issues relating to being in a relationship, then not being in one anymore should solve the problem? That makes sense to me.

My partner and I, when we moved in with one another, specifically got a two bedroom apartment so that we could still live together, on the off chance we broke up. Or rather, so I wouldn‚Äôt have to move back in with my parents if we broke up. Luckily for us, our relationship is still going smoothly.

relationship_advice,f6jwink,t3_dro1ni,1572901283.0,"The biggest hurdle is adjusting where you find your value in yourself. You're valuable even without the focused romantic interest directed to you during a relationship. It's a big adjustment to make, going from being in a relationship to being out of one, and it's normal to feel a sense of being lost in a way. I wish I had more concrete advice than just the general tips of time healing all wounds and all that bull, but I can offer the meager amount of comfort that a stranger can offer: You're going to be okay, in the end. Sadness doesn't last forever, even though it likes to trick us into thinking it does."
dating_advice,f6jsp90,t3_drf7he,1572899638.0,"One tip I feel comfortable giving is try to give up the idea of the ""one"" perfect girl. Having a healthy and long lasting relationship with someone you're compatible with isn't a once in a lifetime thing. Relationships are hard work, and even if you believe in fate or destiny and all that jazz, whoever you're ""destined"" to be with? The relationship won't be without faults. You have to put in the work.

That being said, feeling lonely is a hard thing to have to cope with, and I sympathize with you heavily on that. It might be good to work on being okay sitting in the loneliness instead of trying to escape it every which way.

For what it's worth, I believe we're compatible with more than one person, and that compatibility isn't always detectable at first glance. Figure out what you want, and in the meantime befriend more girls. You might just get lucky."

I can‚Äôt speak for him directly but the best you can do without any specific directions from him is just treat him like the man that he is. Like if there‚Äôs a situation y‚Äôall end up in where you‚Äôre around someone he‚Äôs not out to, he‚Äôll tell you to misgender him for safety. But unless he explicitly says something about that, just treat him like a dude.
