politics,fqiryex,t1_fqipzcs,1589400064.0,"I don’t support him. But people who twist words around and follow the liberal hive mind are sheep. Don’t be sheep. He has racist undertones but he was not implying all Mexicans were bad people in that particular context. He was clearly implying that we have many illegals who are criminals. Again this is a FACT.

For another thing, why would any American citizen support illegal immigration? My grandparents came here from Ireland and Poland and became citizens LEGALLY. As did most of our earlier bloodline. Those who seek asylum should definitely have it easier but we’re in the middle of huge homelessness epidemic alongside the fact that millions of Americans don’t have adequate healthcare, and we continue supporting welfare programs to the point where the real mentally ill cant afford to live because people abuse welfare who don’t need it 24/7 365.

Edit: it “sounded” racist isn’t justifiable in any way. Everything can sound racist if you make it so. Saying all white people are privileged, is itself racist — there are many white populations like in the Slavic countries, Europe, Russia, USA (this is where the biggest privilege is), UK, etc."

So far the DOJ along with many in the legal system have concurred that impeachment won’t work because there’s no grounds for it. Sure he’s a bit of a dickhead but hey, I respect the office not the man.
