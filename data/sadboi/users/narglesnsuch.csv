Good luck on your journey and please keep us up to date on your progress :)"

For me, I had to relinquish the idea that home was a place. It caused a lot of emotional distress because I never felt i belonged besides, well, that one house. With therapy and healing, I've come to find my idea of home was a physical thing because I never felt comfortable with who I was and my body. For me, home became myself.

I understand not everyone can or wants to identify in this way, but i hope it helps offer a new possibility or answer.

Never discussed and never mourned. Just swept under the rug.

Only 35 years ago too!!"
mentalhealth,fhgqb66,t3_f34kja,1581574963.0,"Hello,

I felt the same way you did and it was one of the best choices I'd ever made to admit myself.

If you feel like you should go, then take yourself, especially if it is a lingering feeling.

For me, it was either go to the hospital or go to the grave. That black and white.

I had decided that the thoughts feelings and actions that I kept making and experiencing was becoming too overwhelming, to the point of being scared of myself. It felt like impending doom that I couldnt describe to others.

I began research on how to admit myself to a hospital because....well, tbh, I didnt know what else to do. My family didnt believe me about the severity of my mental health and my friends saw I was getting worse and worse but theres only so much they can say or do....

I decided a day to go to the ER. I went to the front desk and told them I was feeling suicidal. They took me to the back, held me for a bit, asking me questions about how I felt, my suicide plan, etc etc.

I was turned away. I was told I wasnt sick enough. That I was just young and overwhelmed.

A month later I was back in the hospital telling them I was suicidal. Same show. when the doctor came in, she said what the last one did: you SEEM fine.

So I told her, ""Nobody takes me seriously because I'm able to perfectly explain the emptiness and fear that i feel, but I'm genuinely afraid of what I might do to myself and that's why I made the decision to bring myself in.""

I was admitted to a 51/50, diagnosed with depression, PTSD, anxiety, and borderline personality disorder. I'm medicated with therapy for the past 3 years and my relationships with people and most importantly myself has improved immensely.

Making the decision to admit yourself is incredibly difficult. Theres so much that goes into the decision because you're committing to this new idea and life. You're committing to bettering yourself, or at least understanding yourself more. Or even just to be heard more by professionals. Whatever the reason, give yourself the chance.

I'm sorry this was so long but I shared my story in case you identified with any of it. Feel free to reply. It's a good idea to discuss this since it's been something on your mind.

mentalhealth,fhgov06,t3_f33e4i,1581573523.0,"Hello,

I have borderline personality disorder and one of the symptoms that I experience with the condition is exactly what you described, so I relate intensely to what you're saying. One of my symptoms is not being able to gauge where I stand in relationships. Sometimes I over-commit to people I've known for days, weeks, months, etc; other people I withdraw from, even after knowing them closely for years.

A lot of the confliction that I experience is because I simply dont have a sense of identity beyond my likes and hobbies. This makes it rly hard to genuinely relate to others and establish if these relationships are true or superficial, and when to actually commit. In my case, the lack of an identity comes from trauma that I have yet to address. 

I'd highly recommend seeing a doctor, online or in person, to help you and officially diagnose you if you have BPD. 

There are lots of resources, including blogs and books, on the condition if youd like to research it.

I'm not recommending self diagnosis, but it could just be one answer, as it proved to be for me.

I hope that things get easier for you. It can get really lonely not knowing who you are and where you stand in peoples lives, including your own. Be patient with yourself and remember to treat yourself with same kindness you afford others.
