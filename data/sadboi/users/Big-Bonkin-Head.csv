But there is also a history behind why Texas plays more Western culture. 

Since Texas is Post-Antebellum, it has that large frontier mentality, many Deep Southerners and Upland Southerners moves west to forget the Confederacy, starting a new life, however during the 1930s, Texas took a step to redefine its culture, more Cowboys, less plantations, more ranches, less hoedowns, more desert, less green, more frontier, less laid back, even movies depict most of Texas like it’s the Wild West of the Wyoming, Nevada and other truly Western states. 

But this was because Texas wanted to distance itself from the Confederacy even more. North Central and East Texas had a big number of slaves.
