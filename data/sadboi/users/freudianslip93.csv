BPD,famupd7,t3_e9zedb,1576213402.0,Sounds like an amazing therapist.
BPD,faij35h,t1_faftivn,1576109055.0,Thanks for your advice  and listening 🙂
BPD,faflpgv,t1_fafl42e,1576025921.0,Thanks I’ll post there too. She apologised and said he had been kicked out of his parents so he stayed here and she thought everyone would get along and nobody would say anything. She had apparently done the same thing to her parents and just had him casually living there. I told her because he’s been kicked out don’t kick him out straight away but I don’t want him living here. She seemed really understanding but nothing has changed. If anything he has gotten worse with the animals and she’s started to follow suit by smacking the dog if he pee’s etc. I haven’t said anything to him yet.
addiction,f9t6w6w,t1_f9t6obk,1575610812.0,Something similar happened to me on thanksgiving. In a panic I called my grandpa and asked for advice when to take to the hospital and I’m glad I did. I think telling someone will be best because she obviously knows she’s doing something wrong and needs the support getting back on track. She will be pissed but will understand why.
addiction,f9t6kt6,t3_e6uavf,1575610499.0,I’m so sorry. I can’t relate completely but I can relate in a lot of ways. You kind of revert to that same scared little kid when something like that happens again after so long.
BPD,f9t0eca,t3_e6t8no,1575605119.0,I accidentally forgot my best friends birthday. A few of them even. I’ve got so much going on in life that i cant remember everyone’s birthday. It might have been an honest mistake
BPD,f9sxv05,t3_e6sxfi,1575603241.0,I don’t know if it decreased but I knew how to manage it better when it happened I guess.
BPD,f9sravj,t3_e6ryx9,1575598671.0,Good question. Idk
aspd,f9rfje2,t1_f9reb41,1575575618.0,😬yikes
aspd,f9qz225,t1_f9qv9u9,1575568952.0,“They wouldn’t pick up” 😂 idk why but those 9/11 videos I always watch the jumpers because I find it interesting how they fall and my mom thought that was a bit weird for a 7 year old at the time. I’ve always just had a lack of empathy towards people and idk why. I just really don’t care who is hurt or who I hurt
aspd,f9qugv1,t1_f9qppw8,1575567110.0,I can kind of relate to that. My normal response to tragic things are to laugh or think it’s funny so I’ve learned to try to mimic other people and say sorry or something but I really don’t care that much or feel anything. And anger is really the only emotion I experience really strongly.
BPD,f9qpwjk,t1_f9qiw93,1575565111.0,I went to therapy and did some DBT. Nothing else really worked for me. I guess start by getting to know who you are and your interests. Focus on those interests instead of the people bringing you happiness.
aspd,f9qpnvq,t1_f9qgo5y,1575565007.0,I deff feel like I experience all of those so idk. Thanks for your help
BPD,f9qg8km,t3_e6ij2d,1575560611.0,"Yes it’s unhealthy. I was like that and it ruined a relationship because I put too much pressure on them to create my happiness for me. They were my source of it and that can ruin them.

Also I have been on the other end of it for another BPD person and I avoided them to the point I came home and spent all of my time in my room away from them."
BPD,f9qb92l,t1_f9peq8s,1575558292.0,Oh god same. I look back at that and it’s so embarrassing lol
aspd,f9qb33a,t1_f9px09u,1575558215.0,"Abandonment is only felt with my family and my significant other 

Nah I don’t self harm. Unless you consider punching things self harm but it’s more of a releasing anger thing than I feel I deserve punishment 

Yeah my identity and emotions are unstable 

I don’t feel shame or guilt 

Personal gain and power yeah"
aspd,f9qapsv,t1_f9pighl,1575558039.0,I do also have a lot of those symptoms as well but I’ve never been told I have conduct disorder. Basically I lied that I never got in trouble with the law when she diagnosed me with BPD. I’m certain I have bpd but I feel like it’s much more than that sometimes.
BPD,f9p19bj,t1_f9p0xv6,1575518833.0,Not sure if you’re into piano covers but if you haven’t heard of Rousseau you should check the channel out. I’ll watch those videos for hours on end

BPD,f9p0g28,t3_e6bewi,1575518219.0,Hello- I see this was posted awhile ago. Are you still having a panic attack? If so take a few deep breaths and focus on the breathing
BPD,f9p08bu,t3_e6bfsz,1575518061.0,For what it’s worth I’m glad you’re okay. Bpd is a bitch but we’re all in this mess together to hold each other up
BPD,f9oz0qr,t1_f9oys85,1575517167.0,Maybe just don’t open up to her. She doesn’t seem very open to what you have to say. Find people who will validate your experiences and feelings because you’re right to be upset about the abuse you experienced. If you ever need to talk my inbox is always open.
BPD,f9oymju,t3_e6b8qg,1575516878.0,I think it’s justified because you were treated like shit and she completely dismissed your feelings.
aspd,f9oyayt,t1_f9oxxe4,1575516645.0,Maybe 🤷‍♂️
aspd,f9ox46k,t1_f9owewm,1575515789.0,? This doesn’t answer my question at all
aspd,f9ovon7,t3_e5xa42,1575514770.0,I have a question. Idk if any of you can help me. I am diagnosed with BPD but I feel like I have really strong traits of ASPD but not sure if it’s enough to be diagnosed. How did you guys know that you struggled with it?

CPTSD,f9m2v6s,t3_e5utyx,1575439542.0,I think your mom might have just been scared. Seeing as she scored you much lower I don’t think she realized a lot of things and how you struggle. It sounds like you hide it pretty well.

BPD,f9lhtqv,t1_f9lh3ov,1575423446.0,Oh I completely understand where you’re coming from. Sometimes when I get pissed off that someone has been inconsiderate I try to remember that people who don’t experience BPD have no clue how a minor thing to them can feel like the end of the world and so shitty so I give them the benefit of the doubt. I agree she could have said thanks because you did her a favor but she didn’t and it happens sometimes unfortunately
NonBinary,f9lh091,t3_e5q23k,1575422879.0,I deal with this exact problem

BorderlinePDisorder,f9l8wh1,t1_f9l1imt,1575417234.0,Oh hell yes!! And my gf just knows now what my triggers are and when I’m likely to start to get angry which helps when people are understanding

NonBinary,f9kz1q1,t1_f9kyr1b,1575410795.0,"Nice to meet you! For me something that feels validating is wearing a men’s top, or men’s shaving cream, body wash etc. Nothing too crazy because conservative bs but it’s just enough to feel like I’m being authentic. Take your time and experiment with what feels right 🙂"
BPD,f9kycha,t1_f9ky1pd,1575410374.0,"No problem. And remember that it’s okay if you struggle. It took a long time before I felt like I made any progress at all, but I have and I’m so thankful for DBT. 🙂"
BPD,f9kxr46,t3_e5ocks,1575410019.0,When doing the weekly assignments try to start with small accomplishments that are out of your comfort zone but not completely overwhelming.
personalitydisorders,f9ksv12,t1_f9kkggx,1575407195.0,Just simply tell them you think you’re struggling with more than depression and it could be a personality disorder. Good luck 🙂

addiction,f9k2ymh,t3_e5jrjk,1575391663.0,Can you involuntarily check people into rehab? I think it’s pretty severe and past the intervention stage if he’s still messing around despite almost dying. :(
BPD,f9jt33e,t1_f9jq9qg,1575385078.0,I would say that’s something a lot of us probably struggle with. Even in my sleep I’ll have those little flare ups too. But it definitely helps me to know that it’s really just the BPD being a pain and nothing else. It’s good you have enough control right now to not act on anything! I’m willing to bet once you’re getting treatment it will pop up less and less and should become more of a rare occurrence. They only seem to happen now when I’m really bored and things are going well because she’s not chaotic lol.
BPD,f9jpttx,t3_e5hmgv,1575382619.0,I have before. I asked my therapist why I feel the need and she said your brain doesn’t really know what safe and secure feels like. The chaos of it all feels more normal so subconsciously it’s more “comfortable” for you to push away and try to ruin something good. I was honest with my gf and she knows now that if I’m having an outburst and pushing her away then that’s exactly what’s happening.
BPD,f9jpk14,t3_e5he27,1575382403.0,"I think if she works on it extensively then yes. I used to lie about little things because I felt like I had to. Not because of them but because as a child I had to so that’s just how my brain is wired now. My partner has made me realize that i won’t get “in trouble” for telling the truth even if I don’t want to and am scared to. It’s made things better in the long run. Possibly tell her how it makes you feel and realize she might lash out but sometimes we need the cold, hard truth thrown at us to change our actions."
BPD,f9jp6wl,t3_e5hf0t,1575382115.0,"Yup. It pissed me off so to show her I actually am struggling just the same I wrote all of my emotions on a piece of paper and took it to therapy. It had words like hate, rage, sick, empty etc. and then i think she soon found out I wasn’t making anything up or wasn’t “dramatic or bad” enough to be borderline. Good luck."
CPTSD,f9jobs2,t3_e5gvnq,1575381402.0,:) this is the content we need
BPD,f9jo61d,t3_e5ha97,1575381269.0,I think a lot of people can relate to this feeling. I never cut but my thing has been wreckless driving and to punch things until my hands are basically wrecked. I started to become ashamed when people asked what happened and it made me find different outlets for my anger and frustration. I know it’s not that simple but basically you’re not alone in this feeling.
BPD,f9jnuv4,t3_e5hc7a,1575381002.0,You’ll definitely be okay :) you’re never alone in this feeling.
BorderlinePDisorder,f9jnq3i,t1_f9j1plz,1575380887.0,"It kinda sounds like it. When I’m feeling all out of whack I usually do nice things for myself like get my nails done, get my hair cut, buy something small that I’ve been wanting. If it doesn’t help in the long run at least for a short period you’ve got something to focus on and it’s healthy so hey lol."
CPTSD,f9jml0y,t1_f9izfnt,1575379887.0,"Thank you! My psych had mentioned starting EMDR but I was beginning to wonder why never CBT, sounds like I should be thankful she didn’t now lol. Thanks for taking the time to explain :)"
BPD,f9j0cgs,t3_e5btuv,1575351287.0,If I’m understanding this correctly I think I relate. I have trouble telling stories but it’s because my memory is horrible and I only remember bits and pieces. I have noticed though I do have a funny way of wording things sometimes kind of like the order of saying something? It might be in my head but I feel awkward socializing sometimes because of it.
BPD,f9izvmt,t3_e56jcs,1575350838.0,"It was more extreme and frequent during the beginning stages of being diagnosed. Through open communication, me working on myself in DBT and my partner learning about BPD we have made it a pretty safe place for me to express my struggle with all of it before I turn into “you are a piece of shit and i hate you” type of thinking."

CPTSD,f9il40d,t1_f9ijqox,1575339767.0,"It’s good that you’ve accepted it. I really don’t even forgive people because of them anymore because after a certain point I’m just done with them and the BS. I do it for myself so that I don’t let them ruin my day and obsess over it. I kind of just accept they’re an asshole and will probably always be one and that’s their problem, not mine. If he’s triggering you then I think considering cutting ties or distancing yourself for awhile would probably be the smartest thing you could do. That’s a personal opinion though."
personalitydisorders,f9ijvke,t3_e2m1gj,1575338918.0,Sounds a bit like borderline personality disorder. Look over the criteria and see if it fits- If so seek medical help. For right now if you are still feeling like you want to hurt yourself check yourself into a hospital. You’re definitely not alone in all of those feelings
CPTSD,f9ij2gt,t3_e59kxb,1575338358.0,I can in a way relate to some of this. My mom will brush things under the rug and pretend my life wasn’t so bad. It is true others might have had it worse but it doesn’t excuse the things people have done to create years of trauma. It is likely he will never fully acknowledge or apologize for what he has done and how he has treated you. It’s understandable to be upset and blow your top off. Your hurt is very valid and unfortunately some people will never get an apology and the only way to start to get over it is to forgive them for your sake and move forward without it.

CPTSD,f9ihcm9,t3_e54tbk,1575337155.0,My past roommate said he had RSD and it looked a lot like BPD. I often wonder if he had both honestly. He took on other people’s interests/ personality traits to fit in a lot. Any slight hint of rejection and he flew off the handle. From what I know of he had a verbally/emotionally/physically abusive childhood. He also has adhd.

CPTSD,f9h8kev,t3_e4y2bq,1575310906.0,I’m sorry you’re going through a hard time and feel lonely. I think you are definitely in the right. All you were doing was looking back at memories and he lashed out. Nothing gives him the excuse to talk to you or treat you poorly. Being around verbally abusive people can make your illness worse so only you can really decide if he is better in or out of your life.
CPTSD,f9h4tah,t3_e4ylme,1575309133.0,YESSS!!!! Once you’re up to it maybe do something nice for yourself because you deserve to be treated well.

Explosive anger but I feel like it could be both disorders. A lot of the symptoms for me seem to go hand in hand with both disorders. I’m not sure about others. I hope this helped."
BorderlinePDisorder,f9gnfuy,t3_e32xde,1575301996.0,In simple terms it can be hell on earth and is STRONGLY not recommended to do.
BorderlinePDisorder,f9gmsgm,t3_e389v0,1575301726.0,"So I have BPD and I encourage my partner to call me out on my BS. When I was in a really unhealthy state I would lash out and anything she said made me more belligerent and in a vile rage. What they say is not personal. I would not own up to my actions or ever apologize. There have been times she has said I have said or done something that I just don’t remember at all. It’s important to listen to the person with mental illness but do not enable them. Sometimes when I’m getting a little difficult to deal with we will take some time apart/ just a few hours or so and when we are both calm we will talk it out, that can really help and it’s awesome for healthy communication."
