There are other meds you can try to manage your symptoms that are less  intense then seroquel! I take mood stabilizer - carbamazepine and it works wonders for me, and I also have Seroquel prescribed but only as needed, so if I was to find myself where you are now I would take seroquel (low dose) just to basically knock myself down and go to sleep for a few days. It helps me stabilise when I go out of hand, but for the long run I didn't like it, mainly because of the weight issues. 

I'm sorry your psychiatrist left, it's such a bad timing and I completely understand how you feel. It's not easy to find a right doctor, so it sucks when you loose them. But stay strong, there are others there that are helpful! Wishing you luck."

And for me it was a bit of all. Sometimes my sleep would decrease but not enough to be detectable, sometimes I stayed in bed toss and turn until the morning came, often I forced myself to sleep but would wake up million times during the night. It really depends. On rare occasions I stayed up all night. 
When I stay awake at night but sleep during the day, usually it means for me a mixed episode though, but that pattern also do happen."

WeightLossAdvice,forhe62,t3_g9353r,1588012266.0,"What helps me with discipline is some sort of goal to work towards. Then it's easier to create some sort of plan and stick to it. 
My partner got me a fitbit watch and it counts my steps and it turned out to be a great thing to motivate me. You can also get an app to do the same job for you though.
I wasn't exercising much before so I started first with setting my goal to 5000 steps a day, I started to hit that fast so pushed it to 10 000 steps. Now I walk and jog every second day still trying to keep my 10 000steps goal. 
I used to find walking boring and had a hard time to get myself to actually get out of the door, but setting a goal helped me with that. At the start I had to drag myself out, but after I found a route that suited me it started to become easier and easier. Now I almost get a bit of an ""itch"", if I don't go for my walk."
BipolarReddit,for54ie,t1_for3vdh,1588006334.0,"Also I suppose I didn't respond in the end to your question, I actually feel very normal and stable. I was afraid that my emotions will be flattened and tbh they were at the start, until my dose was stabilised. After that my happy became happy again and sad is sad. But happy is not like jumping on the walls anymore and sad doesn't feel like I'm being consumed by darkness. My emotions are leveled and I'm able to deal with them again, which feels truly amazing tbh. I have little hiccups here and there, some symptoms will shine through every now and again, but nothing to difficult to deal with (figerss crossed it stays this way)

And yes, sleep is the most important in this disorder. Usually it will be the first indicator of an episode, so it's good to keep an eye on it and make sure that you get your 7-9h a night :) most of us need some sort of sleep aid and sleep routine is really important. 
DBT is great and I recommend it if you have an access to it. I don't to therapy sessions with DBT but I have a workbook for it and I am working through it, helps with emotional regulation. There's a lot to learn and understand about this disorder, but it can be managed. I wish you luck !"

I feel quite lucky as carbamazepine was the first medication I was put on and it seems to be working. At the start I also didn't know what to expect and what normal feels like ! I sort of went on and off medication because of that but my last episode put me back on it and I'm planning on sticking to it. 
For the most part I only take carbamazepine! Which is really great as I read so much about med cocktails that people are on and it's frightening sometimes. But we do what we can. I still struggle with anxiety, but trying to regulate it through CBT & DBT, and I seem to be more responsive to those now that I am feeling stable.
I have quetiapine to help me with sleep as other sleep medication don't work for me, but try to take it only when I'm starting to slip and for the most part regulate myself with the routine I have. It's not easy and requires a lot of commitment but it's worth it."

Before it was more like a fear/ maybe gentle phobia though, this time I was properly delusional, running around with sage and trying to find protective spells! I also had mild hallucinations and it went on for two months, day and night, at one point I even thought my bf was possessed. It was exhausting and terrifying:( 
I think my fear of darkness comes from my troubled childhood, that's why I experienced that fear before, but this time it was fueled by mania and it went out of hand."

It was a beautiful letter but it was supposed to be just for me and I was not to show it to anyone! I of course wanted to show it to everyone, and shockingly my housemates's dog stole it and ate it :D

It is such a young branch of science and there's still so much to discover and the ways they go about treating people should be verified too. 
I can understand why so many people feels hurt and harmed by this system, especially that the psychiatric doctors seems to be the most careless and unengaged for the most part. 

Yet, anti-psychiatry sub promotes so many conspiracy theories and ridiculous ""facts"" that in fact they are making it harder for the rest of us to be heard and have changes made. They creating the feeling of being either pro or anti psychiatry, leaving out the middle ground, the place where communication and change is possible. 

There's no solutions presented on that sub, no realistic changes that we could try and work towards. It's mainly caused to be anti, to be a ""hater"", to give out and to do so it often uses unverified or false information. That makes it actually quite dangerous."
bipolar,fnv1p7r,t1_fntqn8y,1587277385.0,"Well, I don't really know where that hunger comes from, other then your distress. If you did progress to bipolar I'm fairly sure 150mg carbamazepine is not a therapeutic dose, I'm much higher and started off with additional antipsychotic to keep me in check, so maybe it's something to discuss with your doctor.

I'm not a professional, so I can tell you only about my own experience here. When I started carbamazepine and experienced this intense hunger I was in the midst of a nasty mixed episode. Agitation and restlessness triggered binging for me, but at the same time I was experiencing fatigue and depressive feelings. What you're saying in your posts and sense of distress you're showing sort of remind me of myself back then. 
Antipsychotic was what helped, in my case it was quetiapine. It technically put me to bed, for like a week. But, I did need that sleep. It helped me level up and calm down, even though the sedation at the start was quite strong. I used it for like a month on the top of mood stabilizer, just until I stabilised my routine and fixed my sleep pattern, then I got off it. Now I'm feeling very stable and grateful!

Certainly, I would advise you to have a good chat with your pdoc about medication and treatment. Describe to them how you feel, emphasising your distress. (I actually did a bit of a show as I was in so much distress but at least I was taken seriously after that)."

Believe my, I don't have a strong will, this medication just works for me.

If you don't mind my honesty you don't sound very stable. From your messages I can clearly sense distress. Why won't you talk to your doctor about change of meds? It seems like the only reasonable solution. 
Of course you can also just get off it, if you feel that bad. It is your mind in the end and you have to make those decisions, but it's always better to consult with your professional."
Antipsychiatry,fntjzh0,t1_fnt44o1,1587243186.0,"Well, I agree on your points here, but the stress caused by the overall system that we live in is another topic to discuss really, but I am all in believing that we need a revolution. It is a domino effect of course and I would agree that we should start changes at the roots. Education, work environment, poverty, domestic violence, wars, inequality - all those contribute in our mental health issues. And all of them need addressing. 

I am very sorry to hear that your government does so poorly though. Many of the issues you've listed are not issues I had to deal with. In my country University is free to all (the only factor are your grades but if the work is put in, there's nothing to be worried about). 
Therapy, CBT, stress and anxiety meetings, group therapy, activity classes etc are widely available and are first line of treatment of mental distress. The diagnosis and meds are actually the last thing you'd get and still with great caution. 
Social welfare programs are providing enough money for a decent living if you're having hard time to support yourself and there's help provided if you're having a difficult time deciding what you want to do. There are many courses and classes funded by the government to help you up your skills while looking for a job. 

Life is not perfect here but we do have a lot of choices. I am sorry that they are not as accessible for you over there. I can see where you are coming from though.
Thank you for this conversation."
Antipsychiatry,fnrq95e,t1_fnrcb0s,1587197525.0,"Thank you for your your informative response. From my own experience and studies I have read not all of that information seems to match. I think, that's the issue of the world we live in. For every expert, every study you get one to counteract it. Plus there's always the personal experience or believes that impact our views greatly. 
Unfortunately it seems that we could dispute all day long without coming to agreement. 
I do agree though that there are things in psychiatry that should change. One of them is surly dropping the influence of USA, as this place is the doom of everything and unfortunately seems to be spreading fast. 
That's a different conversation thought. 

I am so sorry about your aunt. Mental illness is a really difficult one and psychiatry itself as a science is basically a toddler, we still have soo much to learn. I think people tend to forget that. Still people who suffer, the way I do, deserve help. And you saying that what my dad went through or what I am going through is ""understandable human response to adverse conditions"" feels like a simplification and not really understanding that experience. Normalizing something that is not and does not feel normal and never did. 

Also when you decide to bring down a system, you should be prepared to offer something to replace it. Something that is going to work better. So I am very curious, could you offer me something to replace my medication to help me control my moods and psychotic attacks? 
I am very aware of side effects and potential health risk caused by my meds, and believe me I was very against taking them and tried all I could, as I mentioned it somewhere in my previous posts. I am not all Pro psychiatry and meds, believe it or not, and it was the last resort I turned into; after years of studying myself and trying everything else there is including freaking shamans. Nothing work and my condition was progressively getting worse. Can you please help me so I don't have to take those meds anymore and have a fulfilling life? 

I am asking seriously. You seem like an intelligent and logical person and I'm very grateful for your input."
BipolarReddit,fno2kd5,t3_g2tevi,1587109742.0,"Same, I had the most vivid dreams when on it. But trying to fight sleep was either impossible or would end with nightmares, sleep paralysis and crankiness/grogginess. I was never able to get up fresh, so my morning irritability was out of hand and I would sleep like 10-11hours each night and it didn't seem to go down. If tried to get up earlier either my eyes were so heavy that I would not be able to leave the bed or again I'd be in terrible mood. I also experienced those hallucinations like states. It sometimes felt like I was neither awake or asleep, and in those stages my imagination was nearly to life. It was very bizarre, not always bad though.

I was on mood stabilizer as well though so in the end my mood stabilizer was upped and I got off quetiapine as I also had other side effects and I got fed up with it. I still have it to use as needed to help me sedate myself if I was spiraling towards mania."
Antipsychiatry,fno1lnr,t1_fnngtzk,1587108772.0,"Well English is not my first language but I'm fairly sure that malfunction means that something doesn't work as it should. In this case psychiatry. I do agree that using misinformation to make money is bad and having a system that is allowing for it is a malfunction as the doctors should be here to help, not sell. But it's not always the case.

Also I am guessing that you are from the USA, same as the OP. Am I right or not? If that is the case, we are from two different worlds and I understand in your case why you'll be more aggressive, though not necessarily fully right. 

I understand, what you're saying: misinformation is dangerous. My father was mentally ill and because of misinformation he refused to take his medication. We did all we could to keep him sane but it was impossible. And I had to watch his mind deteriorate year after year. I had to watch him again and again jumping from a mood to a mood and being psychotic. Had to watch him walking naked on the streets with nothing but a watermelon on his head, serving as a hat or talking to furnitures. Had to deal with him forgetting who I was, or thinking my mother is a German spy. Had to chase him and mind him until the episode was over. In the end I had to watch him die, while he was in the episode. Outside of them, he was the best person I ever knew and the best father. Illness or not, imbalance or something else, he needed help. Any help. 
Unfortunately, I inherited his mental issues, and suffer in similar way. And as he, I've been refusing medication for years. I tried everything else, healthy lifestyle, therapy, life coaches, healers, even shamans, you name it. I checked myself from head to toes to see what's happening and tried possibly everything I could. Nothing has helped me and like my father I nearly lost my life due to my issues. My partner talked me into trying medication and ever since my life has been soo much better. And I don't feel sedated, not myself or like a zombie. I feel good and happy and am again able to lead a fulfilling life. I sometimes wish my father did it too so he could still be here with us, to see his grandchildren etc. He was only 44 when he committed suicide and it hurt. It still hurts. But I don't expect you to understand that. On the other side of the anti psychiatry coin are people who don't even believe in mental illness, making people whose suffering is already difficult even worse!

Also I haven't experienced any of the drug misinformation or any of what you say really. Every doctor I've ever been to always told me of possible side effects and risks. None of the doctors here is willing to put you on medication that can possibly cause addiction. Psychiatrist are not doctors that you can get into easily and psychiatric drugs are not freely given to anyone who asks for them. You have to be referred and observed and even if you show abnormal behaviour the first line of treatment is educational meetings, therapy, mindfulness techniques, CBT and all that. 
I suppose if you are in USA, not like me in Europe then our systems are completely different, so I'm starting to feel like this discussion is pointless. 

Although, and I say it again. I understand where you are coming from. I have never said that I think medical system is perfect. It's far from it. The only point I'm trying to discuss is that nothing is black and white like OP claims. Black and white thinking is very dangerous."
Antipsychiatry,fnmlzpr,t1_fnmkl9f,1587073852.0,"And that is a malfunction of the system and I understand how that's wrong. I am fortunate now to have a doctor who explains everything to me, so I know all potential risks and possible benefits, but I am very aware that a lot, if not most medical professionals are not like that and it does need to be addressed. As I said before the system isn't perfect. Nothing is just black and white. I can see what needs improvement, but I also see what works and why it works. I'm simply against being extremists. Seeing only one side of the picture. I've been harmed by this system, I also have been saved by it. There's a grey area that needs to be explored and improved. 

I truly don't understand why people think that there's always only a pro side or anti side. while the real discussion and communication can happen only on the middle ground, where everyone is willing to listen and learn. I'm starting to believe that it's because people who only lean towards one side don't really look for solution, don't really look for change. They only want something to argue about and have someone who they can be against. It's rather dangerous, but we can see it everywhere not only on medical stage."
Antipsychiatry,fnmj0xj,t3_g1xajk,1587072302.0,"We are made up of a collection of chemicals, so anything that goes wrong in our system is technically caused by a chemical imbalance. You don't have to feel depressed or manic etc to be experiencing chemical imbalance, a regular bad mood or groginess is caused by some sort of chemical imbalance. What causes this imbalance is the question that needs to be answered, most common its lack of proper nutrition, bad sleep, lack of exercise, emotional disregulation etc etc. Most of people regulate themselves through those positive changes. Balancing the chemicals. 

Some of us are unfortunately for some reason unable to do so, even though many do try. Scientists know what chemicals can relate to certain mood or mental changes therefore they can treat them with medication, helping ease the suffering and improve the quality of life of some of the people. They still don't know the root cause, so they don't know how to fix those issues. Only lessen them or cover. 

The medication and the whole psychiatric system isn't perfect and the decent doctors know and admit it themselves. Yet it is here to help and it does help many people.
You don't have to use it yourself if it doesn't agree with you.

I started a running program around a month after I hit proper therapeutic dose and my mood stabilised and it has changed everything. Trying to count my steps and concentrating on making progress keeps me away from the fridge, even during the lock down. Having something else to focus on really helps. 
Of course if it's really bad you should consult your doctor, but from my own experience this was a good advice that I was given. My hunger didn't disappear, which I discovered in last few days when I wasn't able to exercise and do my usual thing, but it is way more manageable most days with appropriate routine.

I started Intermittent Fasting. I saw a lot of people advising it to help manage medical weight gain and it does seems to be something that works well. I cut all the sweets out and if I must (like recently during my period) I allow myself only dark chocolate (or try to, I had some sins here and there). I often start my day or somewhere around midday I get a smoothie into me, I noticed that when I drink a smoothie earlier in the day it's easier for me to maintain my cravings, if they're persistent I have dried prunes and apples handy to snack on (both good for for fiber and help with bowels movement). I try to get my 10 000steps a day either through walking or jogging (I jog every second day) and I do a bit of yoga too. And I obviously look after my sleep routine. I don't count calories, but I watch what I eat and try to make healthier choices. So far it's going well. 
It's really not as much to do as it sounds, but it helps me with my weight troubles.

With good and solid routine and sleep hygiene, being left on just mood stabilizer seems doable. I like having my quetiapine as an aid if things were to get out of hand, but at the moment I am doing really really well. (Also started to loose some weight which is a great motivation to keep up with a routine) 

I understand how you feel. I've been there. It's important to listen to yourself though. Do you feel like you're still benefiting from the other medication? Or Do you feel like you're more in control ?

Antipsychiatry,fn2ylx1,t1_fn2vppa,1586607906.0,"Any illness is cause by imbalance. Trauma affects the brain causing damage and further more a chemical imbalance. Our mood, energy and emotions are just chemical reactions so if any of those becomes odd, there's an imbalance going on. Even if you get too sad but not depressed, and it's persistent, it is caused by some sort of imbalance in the brain , maybe caused by lack of certain nutrients, maybe something else. 
Saying that something is caused by an chemical imbalance is in fact a very vague statement and can be true to many things. 

I have read that they actually do a research on how trauma can be a ""start"" of any mental illness and how the damage on the brain made by trauma probably can be passed on to children. Therefore, creating people who never experienced anything traumatic, yet struggling with mental issues inherited from their parents. From what I know it's relatively new theory and they are only starting to look into it now.

Antipsychiatry,fn2wyuf,t1_fn2u8oj,1586606360.0,"I am in Ireland at the moment and my experience is different. In fact, I got my diagnosis after working with my doctor for a while and only because I asked for it, wanting to know what is it that literally destroys me. 
I was told that here in Ireland and as I know from a friend in Great Britain too, psychiatrists are going away from labels, admitting that DSM is rather a guideline then a set list of disorders, as most of them combine and intertwine and for most of them, they don't even know the actual cause and it's really difficult to pin point them.
So they treat symptoms the way they can. I thought it was very honest of my doctor to put it that way. I was also informed of possible side effects and danger before I started treatment. I thought it was fair, but I know I was lucky to get a good doctor too. Here they would also make sure that you'll try therapy, CBT or other form of counseling before you'll get referred to a psychiatrist. 

I understand what you're trying to say. I had my share of shitty doctors and I know how terrible it is when the illness is so open to interpretation and there's no way to measure it in any significant way. I've been put on sedatives before, just to keep me calm and emotionless, which was as bad as the illness itself. I almost drove myself mad trying to see which of the disorders fits me, as I experienced a lot of trauma in my life, so according to DSM there's more then one thing wrong with me, but you can mix and match as almost everything seems kinda right. Tbh, when I was told by my doctor to forget the diagnosis and concentrate on my symptoms, it was a big relief and luckily at the moment I am on right medication. 
I really know where you are coming from, it's just the way you formed your post. It can accidentally hit a lot of people who are really struggling. The diagnosis right or not, for people who suffer can be a very comforting thing. The way you said some things, like that we have a choice and a free will, when manic or depressed, it sounds like you're dismissing a whole community of people who really do not have that choice and their will is very limited, and they try badly to keep themselves sane. If it comes to me for years I basically isolated myself to secure myself and those around me form possible symptoms of my illness. That's as much of a choice and free will that I had."

His mania would make him psychotic, he talked to sinks and furniture. One time he undressed and only use a watermelon as a hat! and went for a walk, police brought him home but noone helped me with getting him into hospital. His worst mania went on for 6 months and by the end of it he looked like skeleton, he thought we were back in communistic Poland (we live abroad and Poland was under russian regime during his childhood), that my mother was a Nazi spy and he couldn't remember who me or my sister was. It was extreme, it completely got out of hand and when the mania was over his depression got him sooo low and soo dark that he committed suicide. 

I during my last 5months episode was haunted by a spirit. Literally loosing my mind to madness, having so much energy I nearly wanted to scratch it out to get rid of it. 
When I get manic I can loose 20kg over two months, I literally don't sleep or sleep a poor few hours constantly tossing and turning. I get talkative to the point it hurts my jaw and makes me wanna hide from the world, because I cannot stop and I talk nonsense and I talk at people. My self esteem goes soo high I think of my self as if I was a God. 
It is a very different frame of mind to my usual, shy and anxious self. I won't even go into depression. 
It is a terrible and vicious cycle to be going through and yea, the symptoms listed on the website don't necessarily sound like it. When I try to explain to others what I am going through it is a hard thing to do, and sounds trivial, until they see me. The issues with mental health is that normal human reactions and responses are brought to extreme. In my country to get psychiatric diagnosis you have to be referred by your GP and it's harder to get to psychiatrist than people would have think and usually when you do get to one. Well, you probably need their help so yea, you do receive diagnosis. 


I was lucky enough to get into the right doctor now and I am medicated and it changed my life and well, it gives me a hope that my life can be better than my father's was. 
I understand what you're trying to say in your post, but stil somehow I feel a little offended by what you said there, by trying to belittle my experience  and my illness."
Anxiety,fmx4093,t1_fmx2wlv,1586458063.0,"From my experience when I asked my doctor to explain to me my disorder and how it works it was plainly described to me. My therapist also during therapy does notes on how certain behaviours are just mechanisms of anxiety. 
Doctors don't always know how to go around things, but in the end they spend years to study that stuff. While this guy is taking quite well known information on anxiety(I would expect anyway), piecing them together and trying to make money on that. 
I have some experience with people like him, good at selling their products, but in the end not really providing quality. Be wary people."

I had my fair share of shamans, healers and life coaches who claimed they know it all. It is quite upsetting to see how people try to use the vulnerable and the ones in need. And it's all for money. 
Very sad to see it, especially now during the pandemic where anxious people are more vulnerable then ever."

After what we went through last time ? "" I quickly decided to shut my mouth and stay on meds :-D

Unfortunately. 
I know online session is not great, but if you're feeling so bad, maybe it's worth to push through with it? I was against it myself when the whole lockdown started, but after two weeks I knew, I need to have someone to keep checking on me. My mother totally doesn't believe in mental illness, despite the fact my father was a book case of Bipolar, and took his own life while manically agitated. Now I struggle with the same and she refuses to acknowledge that, so I basically do treatment behind her back. But it took me a while to find enough courage and do it. Actually I was on the edge of taking my own life, when I decided to try the treatment first and see what happens. Best decision so far.

Any chance you could at least get some sleeping/anti anxiety medication of your doctor (they still do over the phone appointments and prescribe medication if necessary) ? I know when I'm mixed state, or similar to what you describe, being able to sleep and get myself into routine helps a lot and allows me to regulate other symptoms somehow. Also any chance you could email your university and explain your situation to them ( how you feel and how you're waiting for psychiatric evaluation but you're not able to get treatment right now) and maybe find some sort of agreement with them ?

I know my episodes got worse when I tired to self medicate, also anxiety can bring on weird symptoms, mixing things around. 
My last episode was pure madness with my moods all over the place and I could see my psychiatrist being baffled by my behaviour, but in the end he thinks it's due to drinking too much, experimenting with weed and sleeping pills and my stress/anxiety levels going over the roof.

I saw myself getting excited about ridiculous ideas, educating people on things, things that a moment later I could not even agree with.

Dunno if you struggle with them or not but higher appetite is often a sign of a lot of stress in the body. 
Just talking from my own experience as I used to have the same exact issue with uncontrollable appetite and cravings but addressing my stress and anxiety helped so much. To be honest I wasn't even aware for much under pressure I was until I started to work with it :)"

But my therapist told me not to give my victories and right decisions and growth away and associate them with my misfortune. He said I grew despite abuse, I make right decisions despite the mental illness. It's not my trauma or mental difficulties that made me strong, I was strong before this happened to me and thanks to that strength I push forward trying to be the best person I can. Despite the circumstances. Not everyone does it, even with similar background, sometimes people don't try to be good even though they have the best possible conditions for it. It's something that comes from within. 

When I've heard that it took away sense from my experience and I had to deal with it, but it certainly helped with my self esteem and confidence."
BipolarReddit,fltbkc5,t1_flssqe9,1585466041.0,Yeah definitely worth to talk to your doctor and address it. If your stress/anxiety balances the appetite will do the same.
BipolarReddit,flr328r,t1_flr0klj,1585411938.0,"Hmmm maybe they are not getting longer but as you said maybe I can detect them faster and I am overall more aware. I dunno.
I know when it started around 10years ago I think, I would cycle through some short hypomnia (literally maybe two weeks), followed by a bit of depression. But I could count it in weeks. With time it progressed. My depression started to settle for months and hypomnia would drive me crazy for weeks. It's hard to say exactly but when I look back it feels like it was just a short period here and there. Then I hit my first mania and I couldn't stop it for around 3 months, followed by 6months depression. I still would have more stability in between here though. 2 years ago I hit my second mania and since then I just feel like I'm constantly going crazy (I wasn't hospitalised but it was a traumatic period for me). After that I had a few stable weeks and experienced my first gentle mixed episode that threw me into a year of severe depression. Last year ended with 4-5months of my second mixed episode which wasn't gentle at all, I experienced delusions before but now I was haunted by an evil spirit for weeks, at the same time driven by aggressive motivation to do things but not knowing what to do. It was a nightmare. And it forced me to start taking meds. So it went from a couple of weeks at a time to a few months and for depression a full year at a time. I get so deep in those moods and stay so long there sometimes I forget that something else can exist than what I'm experiencing at the moment. Mixed epiosdes are also a new addition to this madness, so all this together feels like the illness is progressing in my case, and it's doing so rather aggressively in my own experience of it ."
BipolarReddit,flqyekp,t1_flqrmyz,1585409059.0,"When I was younger I feel like I had much more stability then now. Epiosdes were more like glimpses that I was easily shaking off and yea the severity wasn't that bad. That's why I went unmedicated for so long (probably around 10years or more ). Now my episodes are long and scary, they crash my soul, run in deep and cause havoc. And I feel like there's way less stability in between, but maybe it's because the after effects keep me still away from normality (getting my life back on track after mania or depression can be discouraging and stressful).

Recently I decided to finally medicate and found acceptance in myself and admitted that indeed I am ill. And ever since I started my medication I am doing really well, it seems like they found a good combination for now and I'm very hopeful. Maybe I'll get to see what stable really means for me these days :)"
BipolarReddit,flqxm8l,t1_flqrmjy,1585408574.0,"Yeah I've heard about that. My episodes are most certainly getting longer and more severe with time. But to be fair I had a quite traumatic life and I feel like it has an impact on my bipolar epiosdes. Whatever trauma did to my brain doesn't mix well with bipolar. But that's just my assumption.

I only started medication recently but so far so good and I really hope I get a few years of stability."

I know it's hard to hear but no, love shouldn't look like that. He seems like someone who didn't heal after his previous relationship and who possibly is not able to commit yet to a new one  (sexting on the side with other girls is not okay and shows lack of proper commitment) . And blaming you for his inability to deal with the situation he's creating is very immature. I know you are both very young but there's a lot of red flags here that might he difficult to address if he's not properly engaged in the relationship. He might care about you and love you but at the same time he might not be ready to build something with you. Trust me, I know from my own experiance. 
And relationship without trust is in most cases doomed. It requires a lot of maturity to move through  situations like that, which you possibly have, but ask yourself does he? And if this is really worth that effort?"
BipolarSOs,flqlt13,t3_fq4gzm,1585399475.0,"Hi, I'm bipolar, medicated and my place has been in a lock down for two weeks already. Since last night in fact we are practically in full lock down and only brief walks with only household members not further then 2km from the house apart from essential visits ( shop, doctor, pharmacy) are allowed. It's basically house arrest. In my case I discussed with my doctor how to address rising anxiety with my medication and apart from that I make sure I have something to do, especially in the morning. Keeping up with routine is essential, I get up in the mornings as I would normally do and go for a jog to clear the head and follow it up with some exercising at home. I also make sure to throw in some relaxation session in (body scanning is good) and apart from that made myself invested into learning cooking new meals or catching up with movies etc.I am also trying to stay away from the news, only check on them every now and again cause reading up on what's going on shakes my focus and makes me nervous. I am surly on the high wave at the moment, but with medication and planning it is very controllable and mild.

Where I live, psychiatrists are going away from diagnosis all together. I've got mine because I was pushing for it, but the general practice is to treat symptoms not labels as my pdoc said to me.  
I was also told by my doctors that they use the diagnosis more like a guideline than a set direction of treatment because as you said so many things can overlap or develop into something different to what it was when the treatment started. So they take sympotms as they come. Might take more time to treat in this ways but it's certainly effective in my case.
There's also that that according again to my pdoc, there's a lot of patients who grow too attached to their diagnosis which makes treatment and recovery harder and also patients who literally drive themselves crazy after receiving diagnosis. 
There are brain imbalances surly in mentally ill but our own psychology and ways of thinking can  certainly keep pushing us deeper into ""madness"" and shape it and reshape it, creating some sort of ladder effect."

Neither here or there :) I always hoped normal is somehow gently hyped and regulated happy. Now I've learn if I want to be happy I have to look for it and work on it. It can feel dull at times, but I try to focus on the good stuff, like the fact that I finally am stabled and focused enough to actually go and explore myself , see who I am beyond the illness (also a scary task but at the same time exciting, the only thing that I find discouraging sometimes is that getting to know myself at the age I am now makes me feel a little left behind but also trying to look past it. Damn Bipolar!)"
bipolar2,fll29xh,t3_fpfcnt,1585252282.0,"To be honest, my ""normal"" friends do say that stable is more about being comfortable then happy. My partner always says most of the days for him would be a feeling of being content with some emotional sparkles. 
We see things differently, for us is all about emotions and moods, so it can be a difficult adjustment to loose them or have them dialed down. 
I was told once that happiness is something that I have to discover in myself and then work on it. It usually doesn't get triggered just like that, like it often happened for me when I was manic.
Right now I am trying to rediscover myself. Besides from working on my routine I also try and look around to see where my passion is hiding. I always thought it was art or sports, because those things were well coupled with mania , but now I am trying to look beyond that and see what new I can learn about myself.

BipolarReddit,flhq4au,t1_flhosdv,1585167406.0,"Yea it's terrible. I starve myself during mania. I actually find food as an annoyance when I'm high, because who needs food when there's so much to do. But depression, then food is the only comfort I have. 
I desperately crave a routine. My new set of medication seems to be working well and I have been stable recently and with help I am trying to organise myself one step at a time. Bringing on some gentle exercises and watch what I eat. 
It is so difficult to navigate this illness though. We are given medications that make loosing weight difficult but are not effective enough, so at the same time we have to watch to not over exercise etc because that kind of stimulation can trigger an episode.

I know diagnosis can give some sort of comfort, I was sticking to mine obsessively but the reality is that your diagnosis might change a few times over next few years as they base more on what they see as you attended the visits and follow the treatment. 
At least that's what I was told along side with being advised to chill out. 
It is sometimes difficult to trust mental health professionals, I was extremely upset with them for a while feeling like they don't do their job properly, but the fact is that they do have procedures I don't know about and knowledge I don't have. I just wish sometimes they were more open about what is their plan etc , but if you keep asking questions you'll feel less in the dark.

And I hear you there, the landlord issues seems to be everywhere the same. 
I wish I could help you somehow, but all I can say is hang in there. Things will get better, just keep pushing forward."
BipolarReddit,fjjjdkz,t3_fdieua,1583398882.0,"How are you feeling at the moment? Cleaning goes faster then it seems when you are surrounded by the mess :) and two days can be plenty. Don't put yourself down. Is there anyone you can ask for help? 
And even if not you can do it, I believe in you :) just give yourself a chance. 
I understand completely how you feel and how overwhelming this illness is, but we gotta keep trying :)"
BipolarReddit,fjeoqr9,t1_fjeo937,1583275715.0,"I used to have more euphoria before but ever since the pain started I usually lean towards dysphoria with terrible pain in the body that doesn't really allow me to follow through on my wild ideas which is a blessing in disguise. But seems to bother my pdoc. 
Today I was exposed to the idea of fibromyalgia and yea I just wonder if there's any connection there."
BipolarReddit,fjeo2nw,t1_fjempok,1583275317.0,"Would your mania present itself a little different because of the pain though? Would it lean more towards dysphoric mania? Recently I experienced manic like episode but the pain and fatigue in the body would still be there causing agitation and restlessness. It was living hell but because I was experiencing pain and fatigue, and wasn't really saying that I feel good, it felt shit tbh, my pdoc was confused with it. 
Now my gp said that is sounds like I have fibromyalgia and I wonder would that effect the run of my mania making it such a difficult and painful experience.

Sorry for all these questions and thank you for sharing your experience. I am sorry you have to go through that, it is truly horrific."
BipolarReddit,fjej7pt,t1_fjegq5e,1583272701.0,"How does it affect your manic episodes if you don't mind me asking? 

I have been diagnosed with a lot of illnesses recently and most of them are not something you can test so I feel quite confused. Fibro ticks all the boxes though, I developed it around two years ago and ever since the quality of my life just goes down. Stress and anxiety make it hell to me too. 

I was also diagnosed with bipolar and as much as I can see clearly manic episodes in the past, I haven't had one as clear recently. It could be that I just didn't experience one of course, but there were times that I did feel manic, just the presentation of it was distributed by the pain. So I wonder how does the pain contributes to your mania ? If it does?"
BipolarReddit,fj7tnll,t1_fj7tinj,1583098057.0,"And hugs to you to. Hang in there though, they say it can get better ;)"
BipolarReddit,fj7qce9,t3_fbzz1v,1583095964.0,"Same here.  Totally relate. My wild moods made me withdraw a lot. And especially recently I often ask myself what happened to me? It's upsetting, completely not what I hoped for myself."
bipolar2,fj7phw2,t3_fbya1v,1583095429.0,"I get that too. Going through a mixed episode right now and really struggling with it, especially that I also have body image issues and I don't really like being uncovered... so either way it's hell."
BipolarReddit,fj67u2l,t1_fj5drhr,1583061103.0,"Thank you so much, I really appreciate your input. 
And yes I did notice that my sleep and energy levels started to be distributed a few weeks before the episode fully hit me. 
I am using emoods to track my moods since my diagnosis but for the most part I was a little inconsistent as I was struggling with accepting my illness. Now I am in a better place and hope that I can finally take control over my life back. 

Do you have any tips how to deal with a mixed state ? As I find it really disabling."
BipolarReddit,fj5b3dl,t1_fj510nm,1583028487.0,"Thanks for your reply. I tried mood stabilizer in the summer but got off it soon after, deciding I don't need it (I'm freshly diagnosed). In November I entered a horrible mixed episode that is still going, 4 months now, but since the start of February I am medicated. I hoped I'll be better by now taking meds but even though my symptoms lessened, it's still difficult. I thought my meds will be adjusted but I saw my pdoc on Thursday and he decided to keep me on the same dose for another 2months, saying that we should give it more time to properly kick in. 

When I look back I can see low and high periods, but this mixed thing that I am going through now is something else and made me very confused. I think I experienced that before in between my highs and lows but more as a transition point than a thing of its own, if you get what I am saying. This full on mixed period is a living hell and create even more questions about my illness than I already had."
bipolar2,fj483xb,t1_fj42p8s,1583002420.0,Omg 8months ? I am currently 4 months in. There are better and worse day but overall it's hell. Wish I knew how to deal with it. Started medication 1 month ago and hoping it will kick in soon.
cyclothymia,fj3fw17,t1_fj3f263,1582982228.0,"Same here. I get extremely obsessive. And often feels like the obsession is the fuel for all the other symptoms. My mind races thinking about it, I won't shut up about it, can't sleep cos I'm so engaged, can't eat . The excitement and intensity is out of the roof. And then I drop it as soon as the wave is gone. 
All the things that our disorder makes us do."
cyclothymia,fj39qx4,t3_f7hpuh,1582974621.0,I think it is. One of the symptoms of hypomania is a goal oriented activity and obsession usually in its weird way is goal oriented. I think anyway. You know if you're obsessively digging for an information and researching for days or you want to loose weight and you put all your focus into it. Or when you want to start a business and you obsessively plan it so you can start it in a week instead of carefully think about it for months. The drive and motivation of hypomania brings it to the point of obsession. That's my take on it anyway.
bipolar2,fj385k2,t3_fb62kx,1582972254.0,I know how you feel. My mental illness has become my obsession in last year and I also feel like noone wants to talk to me or like me anymore because it's intense and uncomfortable for most people.
bipolar2,fj22fmy,t1_fj21dd1,1582932947.0,Oh definitely until dawn!
bipolar2,fj1zod3,t1_fj1unn1,1582931369.0,I have not ! I have to check them out !
bipolar2,fj1u6qj,t1_fj1soes,1582927857.0,"Love jigsaw puzzle too, the more pieces the better. Only when hyped though :)"
BPD,fj1u159,t1_fj1scai,1582927753.0,"I agree with you! I definitely believe in self educating and obviously trying to actively work on your issues, also by researching them. I just think when people self diagnose, they too often hold on to that too much and have a hard time keeping an open mind and forgetting that there's more to a diagnosis then the criteria (especially in case of BPD) .  But I, of course, can only talk from my own experience.

Personally, I believe that mental health services need a transformation. The fact, that in many places psychologists/ therapists don't work hand in hand with psychiatrists, that therapy is way too often not ""prescribed"" together with medication , I think it's a big error causing a lot of issues in the filed."
BPD,fj05qns,t3_farjpi,1582890145.0,"It's a tricky one because mental health professionals don't always seem to be up to a proper standard. 

Yet I finally found one that is actually very good at his job and when he explained to me the mechanics of proper diagnosis and that the symptoms criteria is only one of the steps to make a proper diagnosis and not all that matters, it widen my eyes. 
There's so much overlap between conditions and such a variety in presentation; all that professionals have been studying to be able to see a bigger picture. 
I, myself, am guilty of trying to self diagnose. I know it delayed my treatment for me cos I thought I knew it better and I was afraid of misdiagnosis, if I am being completely honest. It did provide some insight into myself, that's for sure, but for the most part was confusing and I would consider, in my own case, harmful. 
Yesterday, after a while of push and pull with my pdoc, I received my diagnosis and it's not what I expected but after they walked me through it and showed me evidence and explained how they came up with that ( I am very stubborn like that) I cannot argue with them and it really hit the spot, perfectly explaining what's going on with me. 
For a while I have been terribly frustrated with my doctors thinking that they don't know what they are doing and feeling like I need to do their job for them. Today I know how wrong I was and that they listened and observed for the whole time. It just takes time and I think that's what we often forget, because we suffer so much and when we get to see a professional we hope for a relief, while it turns out to only be a bottom of another hill that we have to climb. It can be exhausting and discouraging. 

Anyway, in my country psychiatrist are going away from labels and concentrating on the symptoms, which considering similarities between so many conditions I think is a smart move.

Edit : just wanted to add as well that mental illness often disturbs our perception of ourselves and the world around us. It's simply a part of it, so being able to really know ourselves, to objectively judge our own experience - that can be a very tricky thing to do but is a necessity in creating a diagnose!"
BipolarReddit,fizuk7w,t3_fapjn9,1582875315.0,I have been depressed/mixed for so long that I feel like I deserve a little bit of happy bubbly hypomania :) so can definitely relate to how you feel.
BorderlinePDisorder,fiyzr8o,t1_fiyyy46,1582850735.0,"Yea taking a step back can be good but personally I wouldn't turn my back on it . But that's me . Dunno how your disorders affect you, but I got striped of everything and don't even know who I am while I let them run loose. Turned 29 yesterday and looking back at my twenties I feel like I didn't live much there, bouncing between drugs, alcohol and desperate regretful adventures, anything that would silence that never ending scream inside me. 
Decided this year for a change I try to listen and go for treatment and hope my 30 will start and go better. 

Best of luck to you too."
