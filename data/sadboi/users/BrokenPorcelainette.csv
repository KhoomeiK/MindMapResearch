My advice? Live the life you've got now, make it yours, if you want to scream your lungs out? Go for it, if you want to go out naked and dance? Go for it dude, you aren't gonna be here very soon but whatever makes you smile on this miserable earth, keep it close to you until the end."

depression,foyeji1,t3_ga5xvj,1588171084.0,"I had the courage to post an edit I made on YouTube but the first comment I got said that my editing skills sucked ass (they didn't word it like that, it was constructive criticism) but I guess I'm just to keep sensitive, I ended up just taking the video down, I'm contemplating if I should just give up editing, it's not like I'm good at it.

I see all these talented people and I just want to be in their shoes, I know that it isn't good to be envious of people but I just can't help it, I definetly know how you feel."
