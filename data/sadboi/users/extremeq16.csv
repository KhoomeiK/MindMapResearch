with how many different hints are in the first book to R+L=J, it feels like something that was pretty deliberately sprinkled in throughout the book as opposed to just being a small lore detail. obviously its not *actually* 100% the case though i was just being hyperbolic, i could be completely wrong ofc lol. to me atleast given the context it just feels like it would take a lot of coincidences for it to not be involved with rhaegar's plot"

asoiaf,fqvgbk2,t1_fqvc7fx,1589676667.0,"fair, though were anyone to be okay with it, i imagine it would be rhaegar who very much seemed to idolize aegon the conqueror. while it hasn't happened historically many times, i think it's not something you can entirely rule it out. 

in maegor's case, to me atleast it felt like the biggest thing that caused initial issues was that he just up and did it without seeking the approval of the faith or anyone else. were you to find a high septon corrupt enough (like the one at the beginning of the series), i imagine for a marriage that was intended to be kept a secret and wouldn't be public knowledge, they'd be more than happy to go along with it given you handed over enough gold as well. and to be fair, the faith was equally in opposition to incest but eventually gave in to allowing that.

to me, it feels like far too much of a coincidence to set up rhaegar as idolizing aegon, to have aegon keep two wives, to have rhaegar involved with two women, and to have the legitimacy of his relationship with one be what decides whether or not the main character of the books is the rightful heir to the throne. especially given the subtle hints at things like this, like the line with jon and joffrey about how bastards weren't allowed to hit princes. 

i definitely agree with you that it's not something many in westeros would approve of though, and thats why personally atleast my belief is that jon will technically be the rightful heir but it won't matter in the end because of how detached he is from his targaryen identity. obviously though, only time will tell and i could be completely wrong"

that being said, i think you hit the nail on the head with the bit about polygamy, and i have no idea why this isn't something people consider a lot. in my opinion its literally one of the most blatant pieces of foreshadowing in the series.. we just so happen to get paragraph after paragraph of targaryen lore talking about how targaryens traditionally would take two wives, and then there just so happens to be a massive plot point about a targaryen who was romantically involved with two different people. it's 100% why the entire bit about targaryens keeping two wives is apart of the lore in the first place"

asoiaf,fpxkoe9,t1_fpxegrd,1588984401.0,"the entire portrayal of qhorin in the show made me really sad..

he's one of what GRRM refers to as his ""boba fett characters,"" characters who have little screentime but become fan favorites because of how seemingly cool/deadly/intimidating they come off as. other characters like this are the blackfish, dagmer cleftjaw, bronn, garlan tyrell, khal drogo, and probably the biggest example, syrio. it's something i think essentially all of us are guilty of, because it's so hard to resist rooting for a character who you know fuck all about but is able to kick some serious ass. in retrospect, i never really realized why i liked lyn corbray and qarl the maid so much but after thinking about it they 100% fall into this trope.

this is why the portrayal of qhorin halfhand made me so disappointed. he goes from being one of the mysterious badasses to just another miscellaneous angry old man from the nights watch who dislikes but mildly respects jon. 

he stops being *the* halfhand, the boogeyman wildlings tell scary stories about to their children in the same way northerners tell stories about the weeper or alfyn crowkiller. the show generally just fails to get across just who he was; a ranger so talented that even after his right hand was maimed, he simply became even better with his left, a level of combat ambidexterity we've only otherwise heard achieved by *arthur dayne*. he was a ranger so skilled that even against valyrian steel, would have absolutely deleted jon from existence if he wasn't going easy on him. he's a ranger so dreaded that the fact alone that jon was able to kill him meant that the free folk accepted benjen stark's own kin as one of their own. 

for a lot of readers, myself included, this is what was so special about qhorin in the books. we never even get to see him fighting with his true strength, and yet from everything else we've been told, it's likely he was one of the big dogs when it comes to swordplay, up there with barristan and jaime and sandor. to remove all this is, to me, removing the entire basis of his character in the first place, and for such a cool character to get reduced to just some random old dude really sucks"

asoiaf,fp8zeso,t1_fp8newo,1588408470.0,"> It was damaged when characters got to have their cake and eat it too, suffering no consequences for their (ostensibly) poor choices.

the most clear example of when this changed is, imo, the battle of castle black. in the show, after being pincushioned by ygritte, he more or less just shrugs it off and goes back to running all over the place going ham with a sword during the battle.

in the books though, the dude is literally stuck up in a tower forced to take blind potshots down at the wildlings with a weapon he barely ever uses because of a leg wound. and yet the battle is still extremely cool and feels just as well done in the books. if anything, it would have been easier to pull this off in the show with no restriction on POVs"
Competitiveoverwatch,fp8c7a8,t1_fp8b7hi,1588388683.0,"100% this. the reason i always come back to overwatch is because so many heroes are just an experience you can't get in any other game. it's why 90% of my comp playtime is on rein or hog. the feeling of landing a nasty hook on a pharah or a lucio, or the feeling of outplaying the enemy rein and watching him shatter directly into your shield, are feelings you seriously just cant get anywhere else. if i wanna just click some heads, i can play cs or valorant or r6. but when i wanna outplay people and feel like a 5head, i play OW"
