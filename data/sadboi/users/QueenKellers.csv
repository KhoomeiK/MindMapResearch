And thank you, I originally adopted him from a kid who got bored and didn’t take care of him. And he’s elderly (7 or 8 years old) so I took him in to give him a better life (up until 2 months ago I had him for about 3 years) and then I met this animal lover who told me about her kid and how he’s dreamt of a reptile for years and his mom sends me pictures daily and it’s really helped him deal with things and it calms him down. So if my lovely bearded dragon can help someone cope and bring happiness I’d rather see him benefit a child who needs it."

Here have $80 so you can buy dinner. Feeling down? I’ll be right over with snacks. Sometimes I buy flowers for random people I don’t know and I’ll sit and talk to homeless people when they come up to me and ask for a cigarette. Not once has anyone done any of that for me, and I really don’t expect anyone to. But if I’m able to help or spare a few dollars I’m going to. No questions asked. 

I have everyone’s back even though I am struggling financially and in my own state of depression.  I just feel I’ve given all my energy into helping other people (who never return the same gestures) and I’ve been trying to discover extra energy to be able to help ME. It’s hard and I will never stop helping people. I just need to figure out how to help myself at the same time"
