Advice,fr688jl,t3_gmwxgt,1589921629.0,"If youâ€™ve been on r/nofap, donâ€™t listen to the propaganda on there. Health issues can only be cause by serious addictions. But stopping it can be beneficial to your life. Your brain tends to have a few hour stage during the day weâ€™re you get extra excited. When this stage hits, either go outside and take a long walk (if allowed in your country currently), go in the shower or anything to distract yourself as much as possible. It should hopefully stop your brain from feeling so excited after a while. One thing the guys on r/nofap is right about though, is that you should take it steps at a time. Donâ€™t aim for a year without relapsing straight off the bat- thatâ€™s ridiculous. Aim for, say, a week, then two, then a month, then 2, 3, so on so forth. Anyways, hope this helps and you can overcome this issue! :)

There were a couple of bosses added in which interested me, because of course, that makes for new gameplay. I felt the gameplay was pretty complete- it would be a bit strange to add in an actual boss after the Moon Lord, considering that itâ€™s â€˜the grand finaleâ€™. The bosses theyâ€™ve added are just optional ones during your *journey* to the Moon Lord, which I feel is pretty neat. I think that it would be better to integrate the bosses into gameplay leading up to the Moon Lord fight rather than after, because the Moon Lord is considered the grand finale and also itâ€™s a *really* hard fight on Master Mode."

Whatâ€™s being an ass to people going to get you other than discredit and loneliness?
