You go to left leaning media and you can see whoever wrote it was left leaning same with media on the right. Hardly any journalist just put out facts without their opinion. True journalism is dead. Second, I can find scientists, journalists, economists, etc that believe pretty much anything, which means these arent the ""great"" of our society and we are just stupid peons that must trust them. You have a brain as well and a degree doesnt suddenly make someone more intelligent or their opinion more true than yours.

relationship_advice,fqdm4zq,t3_gi7vht,1589292494.0,"Dude you are helping a kid out and that's what he still is, a kid. I also grew up with a mom that seemed to curse the very ground I stood on. I graduated at 17, early, by homeschooling myself, which cost me a lot of money and a lot of time. Im not sure how I was allowed to drop all classes at a physical school at 16 without a guardian's permission. I would just put on the LOTR extended Editions everyday and just keep working on classes until night. 


See as soon as I didn't need someone to take care of me she stopped and the last remembrance of care was when I was so delirious from strep throat that I asked if I could be carried outside, I remember looking at the sky and then fainting. After that I was on my own, on my own with a sickly little brother. Oh the times she would leave the house to drink while my brother had pneumonia, or her trip to San Fran also while my brother had pneumonia and was on breathing treatments. I would be downstairs in the basement quietly listening to him cough, willing it to stop, ready to rush upstairs if it didn't. 


I would wear all black, it worked with who I was but when everything you own is in the same color and in a dark color at that laundry is easier, especially if you have to wash by hand every night and no one can tell you own only 3 shirts and 1 pair of jeans. 


Teach your daughter that because of your hard work she has what she has. Tell her its important to you and your feelings matter too. Dont suggest helping the kid and then pull the rug out from under him. Also college is great and all but only if its done right and its very rarely done right. My brother is an engineer working on his masters. He gets paid a lot, rightly so as he has spent almost all his time on his career in the last 6+ years. He chose college drafting classes in highschool to work on his associates, he picked a career that had jobs, he went onto fulltime college while working fulltime, he landed a job after his associate degree at a firm that would reimburse tuition up to a certain amount. He is still in school but he has no loans. The only grant he received was because my mom had no income, which was promptly taken away when she killed herself but he also was considering trade school since he excelled in welding. Trade schools are usually less time, more stable job markets, and you do get paid quite a bit. Or he could just work at an entry level position and work up which is also valid and how my hubby got his position which lets us live comfortably.


Also the kid might be being abused. Watch for that. Parents switch targets when they cant reach their preferred one. So when I moved out at 17, my mother started abusing my brother, luckily she went to jail shortly after. He then lived on his own from around 17 on. When she got out he was already settled into a dorm. She returned to abusing me then killed herself. I should have stayed until he was safe. If he is being abused and moves out his brother could be the next target."

Like right now I have the extreme urge to punch a wall so it will draw my mind from my head while Im waiting for my pain meds to kick in yet Im writing somewhat coherent thoughts. Being by myself, in quiet, means constantly being dragged back to the pain. ""Your head hurts. Your head hurts. Your head will always hurt. Your head hurts....."" I usually watch something while on my phone at the same time. Constant non stop distraction. I can be in acute pain, in fact I actually welcome it.

Second issue. Freedom of worship. Im a Christian, you can poke fun, tell me how much you hate me etc. The churches Ive visited are closed and I wouldn't go worship during this time anyways but when the government sees a church at least trying to stay safe by doing a drive in service, no contact and police show up and disperse them, this is exactly what the first amendment is for! When I see people saying that the police had a right to do as such that's a really, really big problem. Because people dont like Christians and on some things I completely understand. Before all this when a Pastor would preach on a controversial topic, I wasnt scared but now? I feel how the 1st Amendment has been treated will have lasting damages. 



Lastly, you claim going and getting a haircut violates the NAP. Which it doesnt. Non aggression principle. ""Aggression"" is the most important word there. If someone knowingly had COVID and then purposefully coughed on you that would be assault and I believe you have a right to defend yourself but that isnt the case here with a haircut. You claim the risk to others is what violates the NAP except you are literally a risk to someone everytime you step out of your door, any of your actions could lead to a person's death, eye's off the road for 1 second, catching that yellow light, coughing then touching something. Hell I saw a poor man go flying after a woman had a medical emergency, sped up and somehow hit the only pedestrian within at least 1000 feet. If you are an adult you have some measure of control of who you come into contact with, that is your responsibility not mine. 


Im in a NON mandated quarantine state, except for 1 county but even then its not being enforced. Everything has only been advice but people are taking it moreso than with orders or demands. Our distillers in our Mormon state started producing hand sanitizer almost right away and the state is employing people right now to make up to 6 masks for every citizen for free. I see masks hanging from literally everyone's rearview mirror. We are at 5000 cases around 50 deaths, which is low compared to mandated states. Our state just reduced the crisis level to orange which allowed dining in, even still restaurants are following social distancing, tables have signs on whether they have been sanitized or not, paper menus etc. People have done this on their own accord. We will see an increase of course as people make their way back out and that's why Im still at home but still its their right accept that risk and go out or not."

Ah, 7th grade. New school. In a super religious town of which the religion you are no part of. You just moved. Everyone has known each other since they were toddlers. Pretty much everyone is rich/beautiful and Im the new kid. This teacher was completely bonkers which I found out later. He promised anyone who brought in a newspaper with a train on the front page an ""A"" for the term, he also made us memorize the directions from our town to a convention center. Why, though?!?! Seriously? He had a heart attack and since he never missed work, had pretty much enough tine to retire so I think they kind of forced him to after that. Anywho back to my story... On the 2nd day of a new school, yes the 2nd freaking day. I was in US History we are assigned a chapter to read and a worksheet/notes to fill out, I finished before the period ended so I did what the student manual had said and started reading my book, quietly. A few minutes in, he comes directly to me and asks why Im not reading further ahead, I just kind of stutter and turn bright red, mortified. So he heads to the front of the class, specifically points me out with my name and says thanks to me everyone would receive extra homework. I thought I would die right there. This teacher is who taught me that bad teachers first make your life miserable and second are ineffective and waste your time. After him making us memorize the directions to a convention center I transferred classes and never hesitated to do it again. Bye bye, golf teacher that masquerades as an English teacher so he can be paid and literally would just decide an assignment he had never given out was due that day. I wrote the same book report on ""Wuthering Heights"" like 3 times because of his surprise assignments.

Just like its your right to determine the risks of leaving your house everyday but Im assuming you are self quarantining as well as me, we have both decided the risk is not worth it, whether personal risk or being altruistic but if my right to decide is to be taken away Ill find a schedule of revolving church services and protests and make it my mission to be at every single one. I live in a red state, quarantine was advised not mandated, the other day we dropped from red to orange. Im not stupid I know there will be a second wave from the change but we still have relatively low numbers with 5k positive, over 100k tested, 500 hospitalizations and 50 deaths. Those numbers are a lot better than most mandated states. People will follow advice, some will follow demands but most will not. We even have a mask program and Im seeing people driving alone wearing a mask and everyone seems to have one hanging off their rearview mirror. All these people are doing this on their own volition not because it became a law."

Except this is Reddit, where society matters more than the individual even though our rights are not conferred based on society but are innate to the individual.

I will protect that all the way from Jesus, Allah, God, to the flying spaghetti monster. I am a non denominational Christian who doesnt go to a home church but all the churches Ive visited are closed and that is the right thing to do for your congregation but if you still insist on worshipping in person, that is your right.

She at first wasnt going to sign the marriage license and dragged me to another counseling visit, which happened a lot and with too many different therapists because they would all take my side and she never liked that the fact the problem with our relationship wasnt the that I was a normal teenage girl but that she could down a whole bottle of Tequila and then take it out on me. The therapist told her that if she didn't sign the paperwork I would be 18 in around a year, do it anyways and hate her for the rest of my life. Did people tell me I would fail and I was too young? Literally everyone I met. No joke I had people hear Im married kind of scan me up and down then ask my age. It got to the point I would just follow it up with ""How old do you think I am?"" because I felt I had to prove I could do this but I didn't need to prove anything.

relationship_advice,fp8c0b1,t3_gbq0kd,1588388550.0,"So my advice is first to obviously stop the 3 ways based on how your mind works. If you keep giving it what it wants that's all it wants. Its the reason men are having problems with erectile dysfunction so early now because porn and other instant gratification has programmed their bodies to work that way (Note I dont care what consenting adults do this is just how Im interpreting the situation and it sounds like the 3 way wasnt a good idea). It can also happen with women and sex toys because a penis cant vibrate, isnt abnormally large/long and isnt personally controlled by you. Second I would really look into why? Is it the excitement? The physical sensations? Etc. Then gently nudge your husband in those directions. If it continues you could seek therapy to get behind why. I dont know about telling your husband because of how men work and even though the stereotype might be they are selfish lovers I think most think its pretty important to be giving and satisfy the person they love. Speaking of being a giving lover. Is that a problem possibly? That he doesnt spend enough time on you? Just throwing things out there. If you must tell him I might speak with a couples counselor first and maybe bring him into a session to discuss it. My advice is solely based on what I think could close this can of worms as gently as possible :(. I also think time and distance itself from the last 3 way and the other participant is a good possible solution as well. Almost like how you crave sugar less after you truly haven't had it in a long time. Im sorry for what you guys are going through and I really hope you and your husband can find a good sex life balance again. I'd also probably really look into the positives and all the negatives of any future adventures just to make sure you dont go through this turmoil again."

The weapon doesnt matter if someone wants to kill people they will, with guns, knives, cars, pressure cookers and planes. Pilot drives a plane into the mountain and instantly kills more people than any mass shooting. 


It doesnt matter much though, there would be a civil war before the 2nd Amendment had any real restrictions placed on it, in fact I think in the coming years we will actually see more freedoms.

worldnews,fp27vv8,t3_gapmwu,1588256896.0,"I love the phrase ""assault style"". If you want to ban anything handguns are way more dangerous than an AR-15. My 9mm holds 17+1, since it has a double stacked magazine, that's not even an extended magazine. An AR-15 without an extended magazine holds around 20 to 30. Now my gun is considered a full sized handgun but it can still be concealed. Im tiny and Im sure I could conceal multiple, not so much with a fucking long ass rifle. AR-15 magazines (not extended) hold 20 to 30. An AR-15 if I remember right is usually chambered in .223, a multi purpose round, better at far range since it is a rifle but not so much close. The rifle would fire the same speed my handgun would which is how fast you can physically pull the trigger being semi automatic. 



Now lets think back my handgun almost has the lower magazine size of an AR-15, my magazines are smaller, is much more concealable and has better stopping power in short ranges. I think these insane lower than the lowest people see that everyone makes this fuss over AR-15s, how scary they are etc, etc. Your goal as a piece of scum that couldn't just go off himself is to kill and scare people, are you not going to pick the gun the public deems scary and dangerous? In a way Im glad no one seems to understand because I like my chances against an AR-15 versus a handgun I cant see until its pointed at my face. There is a reason Virginia Tech is still 3rd highest and that was perpetrated with hand guns. The highest being that spawn of Satan in Las Vegas but sadly he seemed to have done more research and used a rifle in a long distance situation which made sense. 



But in the end you are banning nothing but a kind of crappy all purpose firearm people like to buy because it looks cool, that doesnt fire extremely deadly calibers. I could find a rifle that does more damage than an AR-15 and still have it look like your grandpa's hunting rifle. Remember by law firearms must fire at a semi automatic rate unless you have legal authorization to own fully automatic weapons which means almost all firearms work the same one trigger pull, one bullet.

Im about to have a hysterectomy medical reason is Endo but that's not the real reason, the reasons are that I first cant take care of children, I dont really think my genes should be passed on and I pray to God that what doctors say are true for me that there is usually a decrease in anxiety and migraines once removed plus birth control is starting to be thought of as a cause of increased anxiety and depression. I dont even get to do it the easy way of going through the vagina. Ive tried years of therapy, EMDR, Ketamine. I tried to try ECT (Shock therapy) and TMS but was deemed too high risk of even worse migraines. I do not know what else to do until MDMA, Psilocybin and LSD start to become less destigmatized.



I actually have a phobia of addiction/misuse of a drug after being tormented by my alcoholic mother. Ive never been drunk or even tipsy, hate the feeling of analgesics like opiates and anesthesia and Ive never been more high than being giggly and a little forgetful. I had to look at the line I had made for myself when I first started taking pain control because it was becoming either there is going to be a bullet in my brain or I need to take care of this. I wouldn't ever take my meds more than once in a day and no more than 2 days in a row until my Doctor explained the difference between physical dependence and quality of life versus addiction, they may overlap but are not the same. So I started taking the med whenever I needed it, I had 3 refills that were suppose to last me 3 months, they lasted me a year but still there was this line I was scared I was crossing so I made sure I had control and quit cold turkey, yes it hurt both in withdrawals and the fact I couldn't bring down level 9-10 migraines but I finally understood I was in control and as long as I kept checking myself I always would be. So next came the legalization of medical marijuana for PTSD and Chronic pain and I noticed that instead of waking up in absolute terror, shakily open my clonazepam, go take a shower while literally shaking myself out of flashbacks that I could take 4-5 hits, calm down and even go back to sleep sometimes. Then I noticed extra clonazepam and even pain control  (though it doesnt lessen pain for me but being happier helps you push a little further) at the end of the month instead of counting and trying to determine is this the time that I might spiral from flashbacks or can I calm down. I also noticed that instead of being irritated and my husband dealing with the fallout I could round off the sharp edges for him and me. Better sex because I could finally shut my brain off and focus on us. Better marriage etc. No treatments have worked, others are illegal. Why shouldn't I use something that produces the wanted effects of an anti depressant everyday?



I just had this little evaluation of myself a couple days ago of truly looking at my use and deciding is this still right for me and if anything I came to the conclusion I would be fine with even more, though I do plan on taking a tolerance break soon after I fully withdraw from Wellbutrin. I do things stupidly and just quit cold turkey because the body pain doesnt bother me but I forget there is usually a mental component to it. 



Ive only seen positives (except its too damn expensive) but if I were to see a negative, especially one that affected more than just me I would have to re evaluate my usage."

So I just received this double action, hammer fired firearm. It was suppose to go to my husband but he went for a 1917 Eddystone after I wouldn't put this down. 


I mostly want to know more about it. It has Nazi party symbols all over it and while the first piece of history from WWII I wanted to own was something of the Allies I still appreciate its historical significance and will treasure it while hoping the reason it ended up in a marine's hands is because whoever carried this was no longer able to use it anymore. What Ive read is that it was mostly used in the Luftwaffe but any other info would be great. 


I was surprised on the complexity of the firearm, hidden hammer, double action, safety, etc. I guess you just always see the Luger and it looks so simple. How the gun field strips is odd as well with the slide unable to lock open, you pull this litter doodad near the trigger and then pull the slide off. I just really hope it didn't murder anyone


Edit: My grandfather in law definitely wasnt a Nazi, he was too young for WW2 but served in Korea. My thoughts are that maybe a career marine might have owned them or taken them in WW2 but I cant ask him since he unfortunately died a while ago.

One day I was trying to get home with a particularly bad migraine and was waiting to turn left and right before I did, I didn't notice someone was walking across the street and I endangered them so after that no more driving. No chances. All my actions I make sure only involve me and only want them to involve me. Could I drive safely 99% of the time? Probably but its not worth it so I sacrifice because I dont expect others to. 


We go out. We get delivery. We go on that plane ride. And with all these choices come risks (moreso now). Risks that could possibly be deadly. Hell even during the Flu there is a slight chance you will get it, be unlucky and die from it but the world still moves, rights are still protected. 


You seem to think I dont agree that people should stay home? Im in horrible amounts of pain but Im making masks for high risk people I love, nose wires, tight woven fabric, nanoscreen particle filter, full seal. I am terrified my brother (unhealthy lungs since childhood) will die from it but he chooses to go into the world, with protection but he still is the one who chooses and I wouldn't curse the infected person who touched their nose, touched the keypad and then my brother touched said keypad.


So Im gonna get back to fucking stabbing myself the 100th time with a pin, smoking some lovely MJ and waiting for the world to remember its sanity."
Trumpvirus,foczj63,t1_foc8q0c,1587677949.0,"Yea no that's not how our government works in fact that's the reason we are a republic and not a true democracy. The majority is protected from the individual and the individual is protected by the majority. These rights are not ""societal"" they are ""individual"" and by upholding every individual's rights we protect society as a whole.


Edit: Also ""God Given"" is just a term, moron. Even athiests and agnostics of the founders agreed to the wording. Is just meant innate, not given by men."
Trumpvirus,fobwie9,t3_g6hx94,1587664444.0,"People are free to do as they wish, even if its stupid. We have pretty low rates in Utah right now and we are not under mandatory quarantine because first it is a red state and second it is unconstitutional. Salt lake technically has a mandatory quarantine in place but Ive not heard of enforcement yet. I understand why people dont like it, I do but rights do not change just because we are in crisis. I am self isolating like the rest of you but if the government tries to hinder my freedom Im finding the largest fucking gathering in the state and Ill be there (with an N100 mask and all the bottles of sanitizer, though because you know pandemic and all that). Love the peaceful counter protesting though, that's how you do it, no violent interactions just quiet defiance. I actually kind of think this somewhat mirrors the 2nd amendment issues, we have the issue of a God given right possibly hurting someone but in the same way firearm fatalities are usual their owners, I think the same will happen for this.


Freedom no matter the cost is the only thing that matters to me. Yes it might seem callous but it is literally the only safe way to live, perhaps the only way to live. As I see state governments and federal take away rights little by little, I feel as if a noose is tightening and Im standing here balancing on my my tip toes waiting and watching. You forbid me to do something within my rights and Im just going to do it to spite you. Hence the reason I think you see people self enforcing quarantine and mask recommendations in my state because we arent being forced to. 


Im on no one's side only that God given rights are inalienable, unable to be taken away even in a pandemic. The whole world could be dying and if someone tried to stop you from worshiping or protesting I'd be there with you at your side."

We get into our ""socially distanced"" line except for this pregnant lady who decides to stand like 6 inches behind us and was using her hoodie to cover her mouth. It was complete irony, its like the hoodie is doing you no good but that 6 feet you are suppose to be from me would. I could tell my husband was uncomfortable as he rolled his eyes and shook his head but Im in too much pain to care anymore and told her to step back 6 feet. Then while we were in line a middle aged lady decided to berate the poor cashier for not having a mask, who does that? Im pretty sure if she had the option she would wear a mask. Maybe the asshole assumed that because we were in a fabric store the cashier automatically knows how to sew and has the materials and machine to do so... Some people are just so self righteous."

science,fmoxdt7,t3_fweihi,1586270373.0,"TMS is super expensive and usually not covered by insurance. I was authorized to receive TMS treatment because I dont respond to meds. The problem is that most treatment plans have you go in almost everyday, the clinics around me are only open during the day and I dont drive because of migraines. After speaking with the head of the neuromodulation clinic I was deemed too high risk because of my migraines which I was confused on because there is literally a TMS device for migraines. There is also ECT (Electroconvulsive Therapy = more humane shock therapy) but that's a little more intense and has side effects which I was also disqualified for because of its tendency to increase headaches. But then again I dont necessarily believe I have depression, I mean Ive been diagnosed with it but you tell me after 16 years of a 24/7 nonstop migraine since you were 12 without relief how happy you would be? I do have an accurate PTSD diagnosis but these treatments are all hit and miss with PTSD. Also tried Ketamine and am waiting for the day any state legalizes either MDMA, LSD and Psilocybin so I can try microdosing."
internetparents,fmni16x,t3_fvsrtn,1586226522.0,"Fuck. Im so sorry. I guess my advice is dont shoulder everything, its underestimated how important the grieving process is. In my small family I was always the person who took care of everything else and after my mom's death it was the same. I was too busy planning and ""staying strong"" that weeks had passed without me really coming to terms with her death. The busyness or taking on too much after a death can delay grieving and I feel make it harder to heal. The emotions are important even though they hurt and the natural response is to quiet them with distraction but its important to move through them not skip them. How you heal from it is your path and will be different from everyone else's. People say time, time will heal but its so different for everyone so dont focus on ""normals"". Time and distance causes it to sting less but Im not sure that's ""healing"". I cant imagine the fear and pain. I am so sorry. I wish it could just be a bad nightmare. I know people dont like the whole thoughts and prayers lately but I pray this doesnt even become a reality, that she recovers and this becomes some distant bad memory. I also pray that you stay safe as well, thank you for what you do."
TherapeuticKetamine,fmn5ovt,t1_fmn2pez,1586218746.0,Esketamine has a different chemical structure then Ketamine which is why they were able to patent it. The different structure is having some question if it is even as effective as Ketamine and most think its moronic to pay several hundred dollars versus a couple dollars per vial. Ketamine is used along with lidocaine for intranasal Sphenopalatine Ganglion nerve blocks for migraines. Now who looks the fool? You dolt.
TherapeuticKetamine,fmn1kgo,t1_fmmt402,1586216282.0,"Is ketamine FDA approved for depression? No. What was ketamine used for before? Veterinary uses and street use. Ketamine for PTSD and depression is a relatively new development. No I dont have children, just was an abused one and kids dont fucking need to know this. We are in a sub for ketamine, Ive taken it before it was ever even tested for depression so Im pretty sure Im in the correct sub. Second, I can almost bet you are exaggerating your child's curiosity for benefit of being able to tell them about ""mommy's issues and the medicine she takes"". Its not about you, again your kid has no need to know this, you just want to tell them. Nevertheless you are taking a chance on this hurting your child either by worry because they cant fully understand what's wrong with mom or by receiving too much information.

Now this 9 year old seems to have a stable life with a caring mother and father, she doesnt need to know about this and if she does develop a mental illness Im sure her mom would notice. The child doesnt have a stigma, she literally can't because first she doesnt know what is happening and second I doubt she has been specifically told that Ketamine is a street drug and its use for depression was a little and maybe still is fringe. If you want to destigmatize depression, go for it but a 9 year old doesnt need to know this much detail."
