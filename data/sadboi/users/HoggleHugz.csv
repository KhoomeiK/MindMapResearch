The relationships always cycled like this.

1. The new parental figure acts like the love me and shower me with compliments and gifts

2. The new parental figure gets it in their head that I am not acting right and punishments and rules are doled out. 

3. They break up and I am never to speak the parental figure again whether I like it or not because there is a new one on the back burner waiting. 

Whether they were great or whether they sucked that was my life and I either dealt with it or get yelled at. It was hell. My mom was a kind person and I loved her but she was so wrapped up in her new life each time I fell to the wayside.

He saw a future with me and wanted us to grow old together. He kept saying how attractive I still was throughout which was the biggest help. It made me less insecure. I did cry.

CPTSD,eytg84o,t1_eyte5e3,1567435742.0,"Thank you. I needed to hear this today. I've been having a hard go of it lately. I had some issues that caused me to menstruate for 3 months straight. The hormonal overflow is what started this train derailment. I was then put on more hormones to try and stop it all. Nothing worked doubled up birth control sent me into even more of a hyper sensitivity.

I have been childfree my whole life and begged them to let me have a hysterectomy. They finally decided I could make that decision for myself and I had the operation. I was off for almost two months. During this time I was cold turkey cut from birth control. Something that has been regulating me for 15 years. Take that away and add total home seclusion and my emotions have been on edge since. A few months later my fiance and I got into a deep discussion where I revealed something I haven't ever spoken aloud. A past trauma from 13 years ago. That was the thread that unravelled it all. 

I have EAP through work, aka free counseling. I called yesterday to set it up. Tomorrow morning I will call the clinic. This will be the first time I've gone to therapy since my mother dragged me as a kid. She was convinced there was something wrong with me and forced me into therapy. Each time I would finally open up the therapist would pull her in to explain why she was the problem. That went over about as well as you would expect. So we would move on to the next with the same cycle repeating. 

Those actions of hers made me fight tooth and nail that there isn't something wrong with me. I've been fighting that ever since. I am now hitting 30 and finally realizing she was right there is something wrong and I need to face that cold bitter truth."

Day before surgery:

Wasn't able to eat or drink after 11 p.m. I could have clear liquids til 3 a.m. I went to bed around 8 p.m.

Morning of Surgery:

Woke up at 2:45 a.m. Drank the clear pre surgery drink. Checked into the hospital at 5 a.m. Ten minutes later they had me in a prep room. Did a urine sample right away. Then they gave me some medicine to help with the pain when I woke up after surgery. They drew blood to ensure they had the right type in case I needed a transfusion. They hooked up my IV here as well. Signed more paperwork and spoke to an anesthesiologist. They took me to the OR around 7 a.m.

Surgery:

Layed on the table and they covered me in toasty blankets. They put something through my IV which I think was something to do with anesthesia. That part was weird. All of my orifices felt like lava hot air was coming out of them. It didn't hurt just felt super off. They said it was normal. They then put the mask on my face and 5 deep breaths later and I was out.

After Surgery:

I woke up in phase one recovery at about 10 a.m. They checked my temp and blood pressure and fed me ice chips. Throat was sore due to the breathing apparatus they had in me. (This and a catheter was put in and take out all while I was unconscious). Once a private room opened up they rolled my bed down to recovery phase 2. Here I was given a menu of drinks and food. I needed to show them I could eat and drink without troubles. Once I had food in my stomach they gave me hydrocodone for the pain. I needed to also show then I could pee on my own before leaving. The nurse walked me to the bathroom and they had a bowl in it to collect the urine for more testing. There is a bit of blood. Don't worry that is normal. Getting up and back down was really rough. Once I got back to bed I laid flat to rest. Once the pain had subsided enough I strapped myself into the girdle.

After Recovery:

They wheeled me to the inhouse pharmacy to collect more hydrocodone to take home with me. After that I got a ride home at around 2 p.m. and set up in bed. On the first day I was able to walk around and wasn't as incapacitated as I thought I would be. Still try to take it easy if you can.

Day 2:

I slept alright with the help of the hydros and ibuprofen. Woke up and just trying to stay in bed as best I can. Pain is tolerable. I can keep you posted as I go through my recovery to help you know what to expect. It's going to be different depending on each person but hopefully this is helping."
childfree,epnhxvb,t1_epngxcb,1559327733.0,"Stay active and hydrated before the surgery. I bought a post partum girdle from Amazon that I put on while still in the hospital. It helps with a lot. I bought stool softener and miralax as a back up. I also got a big bottle of ibuprofen as it's the only thing that you can take with the meds they give you. Make sure you have a heating pad and if you have more than one level of your house move everything you need to one floor.

Day of surgery I started the stool softeners to prevent pushing when you go number 2. After surgery drink a crap ton of water and keep your girdle on. 

After surgery stay in bed and lay flat with the heating pad. They pump you with gas to keep your abdomen expanded. It takes a few days for the gas to finally release from your body. Sitting up and standing makes the gas go through your shoulders and feels like a bunch of pinched nerves.

Buy pads for the day of if your menstruating. Use the pads after surgery as you will bleed a bit.

Let me know what else you are curious about!"
childfree,epnctl4,t1_epn8jng,1559325371.0,"That was also a concern of mine. The surgeon seemed to think that it shouldn't really be a concern. Most women who get hysterectomies have had children so everything has already lost a lot of elasticity. He said that since I haven't shot a bowling ball out of my yoohoo the prolapising will be less likely. 

I would strongly advise a post partum girdle and wear it day one through your entire recovery. It helps a lot with pain, inflammation and quicker bounce back. Keeps everything where ya want it while you heal."
childfree,epnc4i0,t1_epn859m,1559325037.0,"Due to trying all sorts of birth controls with no luck at negating my period problems the doctor agreed a hysterectomy would be the best option. I am sure if I wanted kids there could be other options before jumping straight to this. My surgeon was amazing and understanding. He asked me a lot of personal questions and I think he could tell how much thought I had put into my decision to not have children. 

They kept my ovaries while removing everything else. Which means I will continue to produce hormones as I did before. 

I can't say I wasn't scared as this was my first major surgery. It was quick though. They knocked me out and when I woke up in recovery I felt a lot better than I thought I would. There was and still is quite a bit of pain but they gave me medicine to help.

I would advise finding a post partum girdle. I brought one and put it on in recovery and has been my saving grace. Another thing to watch out for is the gas they pump you with. It's to keep your abdomen expanded while they do the surgery. It take a few days for the gas to release. Heating pad and laying flat are helpful. When you sit up straight the air goes into your shoulders and feels like a bunch of pinched nerves.
