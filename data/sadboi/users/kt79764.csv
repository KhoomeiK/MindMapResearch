I tried dating two ace women before.  One had a serious touch aversion and I just could not connect with her because I am a touch dependent person.  The second was way over the top on touch and closeness and she sparked my sexual side, which is rare to happen, so the mismatch was real for both of us.

Definately keep the video chats and conversation going and focus on the positives vs the negatives when you talk.  Helped me get thru months long deployments from lived ones when I was in the military.
Anxiety,flt5bu9,t3_fqmtxt,1585459742.0,I have a routine.  Always make the bed as soon as I get up then hit the shower.  After dinner I hit the shower as well.  So refreshing for me.
Anxiety,flt51uh,t3_fquoh6,1585459482.0,Yes.  Been to ER a few times because of it.  Spent the night in ICU with stress test and scans just to make sure everything was ok.
Anxiety,flt4x7u,t3_fqqqoc,1585459367.0,You are an awesome person.  Thank you!!
demisexuality,flsyn0f,t3_fqpbnu,1585454216.0,"Some people thrive in drama filled relationships, it's all they understand due to past expierences or their personality.  They tend to mock you or poke fun at you then apologize later or simply dismiss it as "" oh I was just joking"".

Personal expierence has me convinced people like this will never fully understand what you tell them because its not what they want to hear or they just can't process it because its not their normal.  Another thing is they hear it, understand it, but in their mind you will change or they can change you into being what/who they want you to be.  Had an ex tell me "" I thought you would change or I could change how you are"" before.

Best wishes to you and good luck."
Anxiety,fls726t,t1_flrtqtn,1585435737.0,"Male mental health issues have so much stigma, even today when it's accepted more theres still that stigma to it.  As a vet myself this was a huge obstacle to overcome.  Glad I did."
Anxiety,flrdbjf,t3_fqmwj6,1585417896.0,"The hardest part for me was seeking help for my anxiety.  As a man it's humiliating seeking treatment for mental health, so we were taught and most of us believed.  It was not manly to face the fact that we had mental health issues.

Suffered anxiety since childhood and didn't get diagnosed or seek treatment till I was 33.  54 now and yes life is much better thanks to anti anxiety meds."
demisexuality,flr7hyl,t3_fq22pg,1585414560.0,"If I see a woman that I find attractive, specific characteristics, it will peak my sexual intrest based on past sexual partners.  I do think finding someone I don't know sexually attractive is a subconscious thought because she reminds me of someone I was in a sexual relationship with more than a desire to have sex with her.  I do not have these thoughts with just any random attractive female though.

It's very confusing because I have met women I initially saw as sexually attractive, but once the conversation started the attraction is gone unless we connect mutually on an emotional level."
demisexuality,flr4k6o,t3_fqfy86,1585412839.0,"I didn't realise I was demi until after I had been in a number of relationships and found that I was only sexually attracted to them when we had an strong emotional bond or when in a LTR was only sexually interested in my partner when we were mutually bonded.  Didn't know the word existed until very recently but I did know I felt this way all my life.

Everyone is different so my expierence may be different than others."
demisexuality,flr1s25,t3_fqkbja,1585411163.0,Serial Monogomist and straight here.  Don't have time or energy to invest in more than one person at a time.
demisexuality,flr19wh,t1_flqzesd,1585410853.0,Yeah it was not good.  Take care as well.
Anxiety,flq2xfq,t3_fq2q1h,1585377053.0,"I had to do a career change when I was early 40's due to back surgeries and chronic back problems.  The next job I did was desk job doing IT support for end clients.  Absolutely hated it because everything was based on call handle times, meeting quotas, up selling services/ products, following specific scripts, random call monitors and weekly coaching.  4 years and I had enough, the stress was unreal.

Due to my chronic back problems I have limits on the type of work I can do now.  That is stressful enough."
Anxiety,flq1t4p,t1_flplk4y,1585375874.0,Good reply!!  Imlike that. Thanks
Anxiety,flq0p74,t3_fq7ssl,1585374758.0,"Never cared for weed in HS or thru my early adult life, beer was my thing.  It always made me feel ""blah"" more than anything.  Got some stuff laced with something or contaminated with chemical ferterlizers and it caused me to have serious panic attack.  Never touched it again."
Anxiety,flpzhf3,t3_fpzhti,1585373589.0,"Before I started anti anxiety meds, or when I went off them, this was common for me as well.  Random rotating physical symptoms where I feared the worst was happening.  Thankfully Buspirone keeps those things at bay for me now."
Anxiety,flpz9a6,t1_flpq2o1,1585373374.0,"I used to hate it when my ex would say stuff like that or if I tried to talk to her the response would be.. ""Well just fix it""."
Anxiety,flpyz4b,t3_fq8z5a,1585373099.0,"Some people just message way too much.  I don't mind a few msgs about stuff but if I don't answer a text after a few minuites it means..

A: I am busy or 
B: Working or 
C: Don't feel like texting atm.  

When I get 20 text from the same person I am like NO.. You Gotta STOP!!  When they continue this behavior it stresses me out a bit every time my sms notification goes off.

E-Mail no biggie.  FB Messenge I generally have set to away unless I wanna chat."
Anxiety,flpb8u1,t1_flp9yfk,1585355513.0,Honestly I had to let it pass and do everything I can to get my mind off it. I take anti anxiety meds so so episodes like that are very rare now.  Wish I had more info or a sure fix but never found one myself before meds.
