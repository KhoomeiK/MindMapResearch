Hitler also did a lot of good things. He created the first animal right laws and pushed technology forward. However, the best thing Hitler did, was that he killed Hitler."

The dude was also missing a leg and had corn rows as a white dude. That was just too fucking weird. The craziest thing is, that I believe he won the date at the end."

schizophrenia,fimruvu,t3_f8kqe4,1582544540.0,"I have positive results using weight training to focus my mind. I hit the gym when it opens at 5 in the morning where I am basically there by myself. When I lift heavy the voices and noise gets drowned out briefly. It is either that or sedatives, so i work out 5 times a week for two hours or untill i collapse.

Exercise can be really helpful and I hope you find a routine that works for you."

I don't remember my answer, but I do have the pictures my friend took of me when he came to the hotelroom later. I had apperently passed out drunk in the hallway while trying to take of my pants two doors from the room... So to sum up, yes they comp spirits"

It is however a bit aggressive to drink straight from the bottle i would say. So it is probably not her first drink."

Unless you are Jason bourne, you are clearly experiencing delusions. 
I know you are likely to think that this message is a part it. I do the exact same thing when I have episodes of delusions. Sometimes a try to reason my way out of it. For an example: Is there any  good reason someone like the NSA would be texting you through the people you know? Or is it more likely you who is paranoid and has not taken the right meds?,
Hope you get well soon. Best of luck."
schizophrenia,f7dxomp,t3_dvk6ya,1573635386.0,The first couple of weeks i was taking abilify was horrible. Headaches and could not for the love of god sit still for one second. I was shaking and my eyes were flickering. After that first week or two it went away. You should still talk to your doctor though. It could also be the flu perhaps.
schizophrenia,f7dxhsn,t3_dvog6n,1573635075.0,Are you sure you are okay? I seems like something i is not totally cool. Do you have someone you can talk to?
schizophrenia,f7dxe2z,t3_dvfahp,1573634909.0,I am doing the same thing. Helping other people with mental problems has given me a new purpose in life. So I hope you will find the same joy i did. Just remember to take care of yourself before you take care of others. It might seem selfish but you can't help others of you are falling apart yourself.
schizophrenia,f6omgrf,t1_f6lt7hj,1573023786.0,"Well i had micro psycosis as they told me. I rarely see complete manifestations of hallucinations, only movements in the corner of the vision. I hear internal voices but have had a few external voices. I still hear them and I know it is my own voices, but i do not control the crazy shit they say.

I was lucky, I pulled though at least to some degree. Few recover to the point i am at today but  it is definitely possible. Keep your head up :)"
schizophrenia,f6ls987,t3_drwhmb,1572959294.0,"It took me 8 years on max dosis abilify before I kicked it. 
I am turning 30 years old next year and have had minor relapses where i selfmedicate the past two years without my meds.
For me the symptoms faded a bit, but not until a dealt with all the repressed anger. I still experience minor delusions and my internal voices still encourage me to murder people a few times a week."
schizophrenia,f6lrvwl,t3_dry2lx,1572958956.0,"Wauw it really puts things in perspective. I have been told the exact some thing many times.
I selfmedicate so others will not see the insanity in me.
Coincidently i am sitting on the toilet because a needed a break from the assholes in my office. The real one and the ones in my mind haha."
schizophrenia,f32drkj,t3_df4ppi,1570603977.0,"I think we have all been there at some point. 
I was convinced that the doctors were making me insane by telling me to take my medication. So I stopped one day because the voices told me to. That was a bad idea. I lost it completely and almost jumped into the ocean. It was winter, I had drunk a bottle of whisky and taken drugs so I would have died. So trust the doctors, take your meds and you will see that it is part of your delusions."
schizophrenia,f2uqmeg,t3_decn9t,1570424934.0,"My delusions usually come crepping into my mind when I am stressed.
I have learned to take time off. It is either that or starting my meds again. If you try figuring out what triggers your psycosis, perhaps you can limit your exposure to that? Otherwise I would advise you to talk to your doctor/therapist. I take a long time to recover from a psycotic episode, so I take my precautions.
Good luck. Wish you the best."

schizophrenia,f2q7ib0,t3_ddwd4a,1570357072.0,"I have had multiple surgeries to fix tears in my rectum since i was diagnosed 10 years ago. I am only 29 today so it is quiet uncommon. However no doctor has linked my schizophrenia to my colon problems. Because of this recurring problem I suffer from anal leakage from time to time.
I have no problems with urine though.

Have any of you an explanation for a link between schizophrenia and incontinence?

My psychologist suggested my build up anger made me push enough to tear my rectum again and again."
schizophrenia,f2q61rv,t3_ddzvhh,1570356299.0,It is more common than you would think. I would (accoeding to my former psyciatrist) have been diagnosed with aspergers if my parents had noticed how odd my behavior really was as a child.
schizophrenia,f267uj1,t3_dbvltb,1569997221.0,"It is deeply concerning to see that the trend of profiting from others mental suffering still continues today. In Denmark where I live and all healthcare is free, we (usually) don't struggle with the problem of companies making money off our disease. There is however still a problem with the stigmatization of mental health patients. Especially those of us with schizophrenia. I too have lost multiple relations through the years. All I can say is that if your friends can't be there for you when you need them and can't accept that you are different, then you should look for friends somewhere else. I know it is tough as hell, but have you looked for local community groups for people with mental health issues? Maybe finding someone who understands what you are going through could help."
schizophrenia,eyy5dzn,t3_czepuh,1567571984.0,"My voices usually encourage me to hurt others in rather extreme ways. Often very descriptive about how their blood would feel. When I try to shut the voices out they tend the shift towards enforcing delusions. I only started to get better when I realized that the voices are me and nobody else. My voices is the remains of the frustration and anger from my younger self, which i have never adressed until last year."
schizophrenia,evos6m2,t3_ckdser,1564655838.0,"I am having the exact same kinda day, right now. My mind is all over the place with voices telling me horrible things. All i can think of is getting home and self medicate, which i know will not help in the long run at all. 
To make it through the day at the office without sudden outbust of anger or sadness I like to focus on my to do list. Keep the top priority in mind and repeat it untill you finish the task and move on to the next. It helps sometimes. I wish you the best and hope you are feeling better soon."
