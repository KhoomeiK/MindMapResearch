AskReddit,fozxvgm,t3_gaarw1,1588198816.0,"Any war movie that’s all about the action a d looking cool and being the hero that saves the day. For example, midway, which is about the deffense of midway is really stupid because all of the pilots are just doing backflip in their planes and cutting out there engines to look cool. And in the end the final battle where the “hero” looks cool and does the most work which confuses people into thinking they were the person who saved the day because if that “based on true events” title card even though it was a combined effort from every pilot and soldier that helped stop the Japanese from attacking midway and how that severely discredits everyone who fought, was injured and died at midway. to look cool. And while some if it is historically accurate, movies like this only get high reviews because of the action and the hero that saves the day.

Tldr: the critics are in it for the action while the movie is extremely inaccurate and is a stereotypical action movie with historical aspects."

I didn’t sleep for the rest of the night.

The next day i was talking to my neighbour when i mentioned the tv flicking on and off rapidly and they mentioned that there tv remote wasn’t working.

It turns out our tv remote signals had swapped so they were controlling mine and i was controlling theirs. As soon as i turned on my tv they thought they fixed theres so they stopped pressing buttons.
