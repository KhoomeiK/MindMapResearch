AskReddit,fq5ct2w,t1_fq493w6,1589100484.0,"My vertebrate physiology professor told me a story about a friend of his. 

This guy was a veterinarian and he lived in rural Alaska. He made house calls and had his equiptment in his car. He went out on a hunting trip and shot a deer or something and decided to cut it up or whatever people do with animals they hunt outside his car so he wouldnt get it dirty. He sliced open his leg right in a big artery and started bleeding out. He had to crawl into his van and use his vet supplies to sew up his leg while passing in and out of conciousness. Aparently he did a good enough job that he was able to drive himself to a hospital."

 They used to have people's names on their tanks (the teacher would grade us weekly on the health of the fish and water parameters) one girl broke up with her boyfriend and to get revenge he snuck into the classroom and poured a bottle of bleach into her tank killing all of her fish. Really sad. The fish were fancy saltwater fish and very friendly. You could feed them out of your hands and they would recognize their owners :("
