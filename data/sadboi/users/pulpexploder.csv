You can do everything right, everything that enables other people to be happy and succeed, and there's just a problem that prevents it.

Think of it this way. You and a group of others are hired to fill a bag with beans. You notice everyone outpacing you, even though you're doing the same amount of work, and that's when you discover that your bag has several sizable holes in it. Are you taking the easy way out by closing up those holes? No, you're fixing a problem that puts you on the same level as everyone else, so that your efforts count as much as they should.

If you're in a spot where you need meds (and I think the vast majority of people with bipolar disorder are), don't think of it as manufactured happiness—think of it as increasing the efficiency of your efforts toward self growth and stability. This condition puts us in a hole, and there's no shame in accepting the help you need to put yourself on level ground."

I have bipolar disorder, so our first episode was on Silver Linings Playbook, which enabled me to talk about my own condition and experience, and share my viewpoint. Another early episode we did enabled my cohost to open up about her past trauma.

So, important things to cover:

1. Qualification—why should people listen to you? Why are you talking about mental health? Do you struggle with mental health issues yourself? Are you a mental health professional? Do you just like helping people and you like researching how to do that more effectively?
2. Viewpoint—what can people expect when listening to you? Do you have strong views on how people should deal with mental health issues? Are you trying to combat any stigmas or common misconceptions? Do you have any advice you regularly give to people struggling?
3. Format—what will the show be like? Will you be interviewing guests each week? Do you prefer to tackle a single topic per episode? How do you prefer to research and convey information?

You can't cover everything about those in your first episode, but I'd recommend at least touching on each of these things."

I challenged a friend to inflatable boxing. We talked a bunch of trash in line, so there was a lot of pride riding on this match. So when the guy says, ""Climb in the ring and put your gloves on,"" I have to make a spectacle of it. I grab the ropes and do this little flip into the ring.

Well, somehow, my jaw collided with my knee, and when my friend gets in the ring, I'm on the ground bleeding. I don't remember this. I never actually passed out, but there's a span of about five minutes I don't remember. First thing I do remember is holding a flavorless snowcone to my lip, which was bleeding, as they're mopping the inflatable boxing ring. I have total amnesia. Don't know who I am, or why I'm there. And I realize I have amnesia, but I'm kind of amused by it. Like, I'm not worried at all, I'm just fascinated by it. Lasted about ten minutes before I started remembering things.

Funny thing is, people actually stopped in to ask if I was OK while I was standing there with a snow cone pushed up against my bloody lip, and I don't remember it. I had people coming up to me for days saying, ""Hey, aren't you that guy?"" and I had to tell them I don't remember it."

podcasting,fghkaxm,t3_eyfli6,1580786748.0,"I started talking with my cohost in late December, 2018. We recorded a practice episode in mid-January. (Doing a practice episode and listening to it critically was super-helpful for us.) We recorded several ""for-real"" episodes and launched with three episodes in March, and have been going with a new episode every other week since then.

One thing that took me entirely too long to figure out was proper mic placement. Some of our earlier episodes have me breathing heavily into the mic because I hadn't figured that out. Mixing and recording quality have also gone up as we got the hang of things.

Another thing I had to learn was simply how to be a better co-host. Listening to some of our first episodes, there were times I was talking over my co-host, or spending so much time on my own ideas and not asking her what her thoughts were. I'm much more collaborative now and make sure to invite my co-host in rather than just asking her to squeeze in between my ideas. I had no idea I did any of that stuff, so listening to some early episodes was really eye-opening to me.

I see people ask for advice on how much to prepare with notes and research. My co-host and I have very different approaches to that. I prepare a ton and do lots of research; my co-host thinks a lot about the topic, but prefers to come in with her ideas only so she gives honest feedback. Both are great. I would just say to play to your strengths. I've always been a compulsive researcher, so it's something I naturally do; my co-host is someone who ""tells it like it is,"" so her unbiased look can get to the heart of things much better than my sometimes convoluted approach. Both approaches have produced some great episodes."
podcasting,fghj2qa,t3_eyiacv,1580785948.0,"So, here's a thought...

A podcast with no real topic: kind of hard to engage

A podcast that uses one topic to explore other topics: kind of interesting

Like, it would be pretty interesting to hear about the political context of ""Street Fighting Man,"" or hear about how mental health influenced Jimi Hendrix to write ""Manic Depression."" And there are some really cool stories in music too, like the legal battle behind ""Bittersweet Symphony,"" and why Prince changed his name to an unpronounceable symbol. You can have one or two songs per episode and really dig into the background, and that opens up all kinds of avenues for other topics. Songs frequently get political and personal, and understanding what's going on behind a song could be really interesting.

I do something similar with my podcast, which is on movies and mental health, but we use those topics to get into all kinds of things, like what being a hostage does to your brain and the multiple layers of culture and philosophy in *Dead Poets Society*. We talk about a lot of topics, but it's all based around movies and mental health.

Seeming limitations like that may seem stifling at first, but it's amazing how much easier it is to come up with really interesting things to say within those confines. Research can be a daunting task, so having a direction really helps to point you toward interesting things.

An idea like that I think would be very marketable. I have no ideas on a name, but hopefully my comment helps you out!"
