depression,fkgh864,t3_fhkb6u,1584159659.0,I’m glad to hear though that you are finding peace in your decision/alone time. Sounds brave and beautiful
depression,fkgh5in,t3_fhkb6u,1584159594.0,"Babe take control of your life— you can do anything. I don’t relate to the guilt I wish I could, I left home when I was 15 and never looked back. It’s been a tough path but I found my people around 18/19 when I moved out of my home town and then again at 22 when I moved again to a larger city. I’m 24 now and dealing with a lot of trauma, but I can tell you with confidence that it may take time and be strange but there’s people in the world you will find that will give you a sense of purpose and friendship and something greater than yourself. My best advice is try not to isolate too much. You seem lovely and caring and an empathetic person. Find your passions and people who share them and let that be your compass for a while. Be safe"
SuicideWatch,fkg6vn4,t3_fhi2kk,1584151435.0,"Don't be afraid to disengage from anyone who is not being mindful of how immensely painful and traumatic this time is for you... I can't imagine how you are feeling day to day at the moment. You need to and deserve to focus on yourself and your own recovery right now. I'm so proud to hear you are trying to stick to a regular activity and sleep schedule, it feels like it's doing nothing but it's doing more than you know. You are inconceivably brave to be sharing this, and trying your best to fight to live through this.

I have lost 2 close friends in the last 12 months to suicide and found my best friend hanging 3 weeks ago she was dead and I had to give her CPR. The pain is immense and I feel really suicidal too but am also actively trying to keep myself safe and stay active as you are. Reading your post has put my pain into perspective. I can't even believe the confusion and pain you would be feeling, but I believe in you, in us, to get through this. 

&#x200B;

I wish I could make this easier for you. Be gentle on yourself. This is about you now, and you recovering from this. Do not engage with people who bring you down. Believe in your strength, keep fighting for yourself. You'll be in my thoughts. I'm so sorry for your loss angel girl, and I'm so sorry people aren't treating you with the respect and love you deserve. Listen to the voices of the people who love you. Make a concerted effort to be by people who love you and make you feel that you still have a place in the sun.

All my love"

Which probably doesn't give you much hope or relief right now, because I'm sure you want and you deserve immediate help and support. Keep reaching out, keep telling them what's going on and telling them you are at risk. Hang in there and advocate for yourself. You deserve help. I'm so sorry it feels like we take 1 step forward and 10 steps backwards, but keep trying. Use your voice and advocate for the help you deserve.

Sending all my strength and love to you to continue fighting for yourself."
SuicideWatch,fkg5jxo,t3_fhzr9a,1584150477.0,"Also I lost an extremely close friend to suicide in May 2019 he hung himself I immediately flew interstate to be with his family and our mutual friends and attended his funeral, then another close friend in December 2019 by throwing himself off a cliff I did not go to his funeral as I just couldn't bring myself to do it again. They were both only 26 years old and I am 23. So I am feeling extremely overwhelmed by the amount of grief and loss I am experiencing with like no time whatsoever to process these events because I was so confident only a month ago I wouldn't have to experience anything more traumatic than what I've already gone through in my life, and then this happened, and I just feel like that's important to add."
SuicideWatch,fkfwm5r,t1_fkeh9yf,1584144287.0,Thank you for seeing me.
SuicideWatch,fkft1ru,t1_fkeyadc,1584141857.0,"Yeah, she does have brain damage. I asked the people at ICU and they explained it was from prolonged lack of oxygen to the brain. I’m not her next of kin so a lot of information I got was second hand. All I know was that while I was in her house they worked on her for 60-90 minutes until her heart started beating again on it’s own and that’s when she was put into an induced coma. I myself wish I could understand more about the medical side of things to process it but right now I only know what I’ve seen and what has been told to me in pretty plain terms by people at the hospital because as I said I’m obviously not her next of kin"
