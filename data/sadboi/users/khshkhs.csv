detrans,fplus35,t3_gdy3v1,1588719875.0,"neither but born female, this may sound weird but

i honestly think my body is beautiful for a woman and dont have dysmorphia. growing up, my breasts didnt grow a whole lot until i gained a lot of weight in 10th grade. so they didnt really bother me and i didnt really think of them. i was made to wear sports bras usually but i didnt mind because i liked the light chest pressure (like a thundershirt on a dog i guess)

i have also only felt shame around my father and siblings for having them or them being noticeable, because they tormented me quite a lot about them.

i did start feeling bad when i started trying to wear womens bathing suits in 9-10 grade and realized that they were knda embarrassing btu mostly just because nudity is socially bad and they were boobs. i should say, my breasts sag and can pass as gynocomastia if i can pass in pretty much other way, so ive elected that top surgery would be more harm than good.

i also pretty much ignored everyones please for me to shave except for said period where i really tried to  be a girl. i loved being able to grow hair and do especially now.

i think girls are badass? i just am not one of them in any way outside of my biology. ive always loved girls and stood up for them and advocated, but yknow.

also ive been a passionate swimmer since i was like three, and swimming is the best and most fun

i hope this isnt too strange."

also, my biggest struggle at work is wanting to be the best, the most helpful, the most streamlined, but i have no clue how to ask for help and refuse to... it slows things down. but if i ask for help i feel horrible. cant do shit on my own, right?

there were... many times... growing up, my car would break down, or id bust into my own window, because i refused to ask for help in shame for being responsible for making a mess, making someone help me, not knowing how to fix my car before it happened, being a dumb stoner and forgetting my keys in my car.."
