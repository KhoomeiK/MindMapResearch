AmItheAsshole,f761ubx,t3_duhg5q,1573421824.0,"YTA. If you’re in a position where you can’t handle what’s going on, you have to remove yourself from it before things get worse.

You need to fart while you’re at a meeting? Excuse yourself to fart elsewhere so that your colleagues don’t deal with it for hours on end.

If your friend had a plan and went through with it, that’s legal problems on you."
bipolar,eu8p3y2,t3_ceties,1563561570.0,OP if you don't mind. please keep us posted on your progress :) also I'm open to DMs if you wanna talk more about mental health and college.
bipolar,eu5usn3,t3_ceyjub,1563485832.0,"Hey OP,

So I’m on lexapro, lamictal,and trazodone regularly for my bipolar disorder. For my birth control I take xulane. It’s a transdermal patch I change weekly. Both my OBGYN and I felt that my hormones go out of whack when it’s time for my period. She also wanted me to be as stable as possible and is amazingly supportive. So I take it every week nonstop with the exception of when I’m spotting. If that happens then I take a week  off my patch, essentially inducing a period so the spotting stops.

It’s not a dumb problem. I want to validate your feelings and your beliefs about your sexual health. It’s a piece of the pie you know what I’m sayin?

It’s a lot of trial and error, seeing what works for you with your doctor. IMO, if you’re birth control has worked well for you for so long, the lithium should’ve been titrated to factor that in. 

I haven’t tried Morena or any other implants. It was an option, but OBGYN recommended I stick to xulane since my body is used to it."

bipolar,eu4w8fp,t3_ceties,1563464601.0,"This is a combination of what I’ve done and what I wished I did while I was in college:

1. Have regular appointments with your therapist and psychiatrist (if you’re on medication)

I was a high-functioning depressed individual then. I didn’t make the time to spend enough time to find the right therapist and when I did find one I felt I was comfortable with, I didn’t quite know what to talk about. I also wished I consulted with a psychiatrist to put me on meds. I would’ve done a lot better in my classes.

2. Keep in touch with the people who you’re close with AND have an understanding of your mental health

Your support system is essential as you may need people to lean on when your therapist isn’t around. It’s also nice to have people that love you and accept you for who you are, and are learning ways to support you. 
—-

3. Utilize your uni’s services.

Provide a doctor’s note to the student disability services so you can have extra support. It can be super beneficial when you need extra time on an exam, assignments, papers, and projects. If you have trouble taking notes or need a tutor, they can definitely connect you with those kind of services. They should also have physical and mental health services. Counselors - both academic and mental health, are available to ensure your success.
——

4. Set up a consistent schedule 

Make sure to be on top of your self-care as possible. Know what time you need to do your assignments. Sleep hygiene is SUPER IMPORTANT.
—-

5. Have your toolbox of coping skills ready

Working out, deep breathing, grounding exercises, coloring, crocheting, walks, listening to music. If you forget what you’re coping skills are, write it down and post it on your wall. Also post positive affirmations :)

Those are the best things I can think of. If I think of anything else, I’ll keep posting here.

Good luck OP! You’re halfway there :)"
bipolar,eu05rar,t3_cdrdc7,1563342262.0,dude this is sick! it's like night and day. so proud of you for putting the effort and making TONS of progress :) keep going!
bipolar,eu05lyu,t3_cdgoii,1563342188.0,i forgot to take my lexapro last night and i had flu-like symptoms as a result of withdrawal. felt awful. took it first thing in the morning and slept through most of the day.
bipolar,etjbklv,t1_etbnnor,1562870176.0,day by day like you said. and it's okay if you need reassurance. we here for u bud. is it okay if I DM you?
bipolar,etjauba,t1_etglnur,1562869733.0,">ntly in school working on my prerequisites for the Nursing Program and I was just told by my therapist that he thinks that I may be bipolar and this exact thing was my first worry. So thank you so much for this affirmation. In my personal opinion, I think stable mentally ill people make the best medical staff as they can actually empathize with patients struggling with mental illness and such. I am a medic

we need more people like you :)"
bipolar,etjaooo,t1_et8u10e,1562869640.0,"Man I totally get where you're coming from.

&#x200B;

I've had to work on dealing with my guilt and shame from having manic episodes at work. As far as work, what helps is having supportive staff.... and even though work is stressful, it's a good thing in a sense that it gets you out of the house and puts you on a schedule like you said.  


I'd love to talk to you more if that's okay. Can we chat via DM in the future? :D"
bipolar,etjafzs,t1_etcl4r7,1562869496.0,"oh do you guys live and work together? hmm... 

i think that can be tricky. honesty and delivery of your message is key, like you can't sound like a whiny baby when you tell your wife what you want (even though the whiny route may be the easiest for some people lol)

like for me, when I told my boyfriend my current mental health was deteriorating again. it was a difficult conversation we had, as I'm the breadwinner. I did mention how it's gotten so bad due to work that I've had thoughts of SH and SI again. I'm also adamant to avoid hospitalization because of the work that I do, but I know it's an option should the need arise. We were both anxious about how we'll afford rent and such. He's a lot more level-headed about these things than I am surprisingly. It took me longer to realize things will be okay. 

I show him that I'm proactive in my self care:

1. going to my psychiatric appointments
2. eating healthier as much as possible
3. taking my medications
4. doing chores as best as I can even though I tore my ACL

He and I know this is temporary and that I'll be able to get back to working. It's a lot of conversations and reassurance and showing that you're making an effort to get and be better. 

I hope this gives you some perspective~"
bipolar,etbsbxy,t1_et8kmem,1562659580.0,Hey hey hey. You’re totally fine :). I’m glad you’re fighting the good fight with us. I totally get your perspective.
bipolar,et8mygl,t1_et8kh29,1562561752.0,Thank you. As am I. Work just hasn’t been the greatest for me that it really killed my mental health. I did and have learned a lot about myself in my current job I do have to say. It’s also made me more compassionate for my patients.
bipolar,et8j946,t1_et8iyon,1562558142.0,"i totally agree with you. surprisingly i work with people with disabilities... and it's really humbling or something like... it's fulfilling for me to help others in that capacity. I agree that it's helped me be mindful of my behavior as well.  


though i have had to take time off due to my mental health deteriorating and this time my physical health is shit (tore my ACL) so i'm FMLA."
bipolar,et8j3go,t1_et8iuyp,1562558002.0,"SOOOO:  


legally: technically workplaces have to be accommodating and non-discriminatory.

socially: ""you can't do your job because you're sick/you suck.""  


that's basically the gist from my perspective."
bipolar,et8iujx,t1_et8ig4k,1562557784.0,i'm going to push for the surgery and do intense rehab so i can work asap. it's kinda weird how this knee injury happened while i'm trying to get my life together. thank you again for your response and honesty. <3
bipolar,et8ikdy,t3_cafsb2,1562557538.0,"my dear i'm so sorry you're going through all this frustration and confusion.

&#x200B;

lithium and valproate are both mood stabilizers. both require blood draws to make sure you're at a therapeutic level of the drug = effective for you. 

&#x200B;

wellbutrin is an antidepressant. prescribed for some people with bipolar disorder to manage the depression. if unmonitored, can trigger manic episodes.

&#x200B;

also want to note that each person responds to meds differently, so definitely a discussion with your doc. 

&#x200B;

hang in there love."
bipolar,et8i8zi,t1_et8a6uh,1562557264.0,i feel you on the frustrations of walgreens. fucking dropped their ass and switched to a local pharmacy in my area. they even deliver my meds to my doorstep.
bipolar,et8i2nj,t1_et84zth,1562557114.0,may i ask how you coped with the knee cap injury ever since? i recently tore my ACL due to falling off my longboard and it definitely affects my line of work and my love for longboarding.... i am definitely gonna get back to working... but i can imagine people will tell me to stop longboarding.
bipolar,et8hrbr,t3_caf0xt,1562556841.0,"so i see two things here. being straight-forward because that's how our fucked-up brains work:  
1. you are indeed going through a lot of shit and it's affecting your ability to take care of yourself, like eating. 

2. you need to be able to do your self-care activities to be able to function/work.

3. it's okay to take time off, go on disability, and take care of yourself. your wife made a promise to you, to be there for better or worse. 

4. focus on the present. take care of yourself. things will be ok. 

&#x200B;

praying for you bud."
bipolar,et8h84a,t3_caeeqs,1562556394.0,"i'm on the other side of lamictal, in which i have seen it improve my mania and stabilize it as much as possible. i did notice one time when i went the past the max dose of 400mg -> 450mg, i had really bad brain fog, i was drooling... i felt really off. i told my doctor and immediately went back down to 400mg, and i've been okay since.

&#x200B;

again each person responds differently to meds. sucky part of psych.

&#x200B;

i would definitely bring it up with your doctor on titrating your medications. seroquel and lamictal combined could be attributing to your symptoms. trazodone for sleep... pretty low risk imo."
bipolar,et8guvo,t3_ca7tz1,1562556093.0,"dude good job for pulling through! first days will be rough since you're getting situated with a new lifestyle/chapter. remember your basic selfcare, breathe. and we're always here for you. hang in there! let us know how the first day goes OP."
