Don't torture yourself if you really can't do it, but give it a shot. Bashing your head against a wall often teaches you something. Plus, you have eight weeks. You can struggle through it in two weeks, re-read it twice in the next two werks, and by the end of eight weeks, assuming you follow up on questions by checking out other sources,  you'll be pretty great. It's just dedication. That's difficult to develop and maintain, I know, but as Schopenhauer says: life kinda sucks. Or something along those lines."

In psychology, we call this the Dunning-Kruger Effect. Ignorant people think they know more than they do, because they only see the surface of the issue; like a murky lake, they have no idea how deep it goes. But experts know so much that they even know what they *don't* know: to them, the subject is a massive five-dimensional web of near-infinite complexity. And that's why ignorant layman are more confident in their ideas than trained experts.

questioning,ewj3659,t1_ewi5w40,1565460662.0,"I'll definitely consider this model, because it seems to map onto my experience quite well. I think I'll try to live under this impression for a month or two and see where it gets me. I do have some problems with it, though: 

I'm not sure how it maps onto the transgender experience - if gender is a performance, a social construct, why is dysphoria related to behavior as well as appearance so hard-wired in the brains of trans people? It's not like, say, a MtF was raised as a woman, discovered masculinity, and decided to stick with what they got because they liked it better. The opposite occurred. Furthermore, why is it that young members of other animal species (and young humans too) have a naturally-arising tendency to behave in line with their ""gender?"" To me, it seems like there must be a robust neurological underpinning for all this stuff.

I'm just spitballing here too, but consider this model of gender: The structure of one's brain and the sex of one's body contributes to the development of certain dispositions and behaviors that create ""gender roles."" Those roles are reinforced and violated by society and the individual, which both also create new, unnecessary ones on the back of the old. The individual, though, has a much more information about their gender identity in their head than society ever could, and so it takes individual introspection to truly map out one's gender identity. So it's innate *and* constructed.

It's seeming more and more like I'm agender, so let's try to fit that above model onto my experience. It doesn't seem like my brain naturally identifies with one body over another, causing dysphoria. In my life, I never really had too much cause to care about gender roles anyway, everyone around me was pretty egalitarian. Even when my abusive father told me to stop crying, he called me a ""bawl baby"" instead of anything related to women and girls. When I was younger, my play was more narrative-based than gendered - I would strip Barbie naked and rub my fingers on her breasts like any boy would, but I would also put strong female characters in the stories I told with my stuffed animals. Because I never had any genuine neurological attachment to the male gender, but still relied on it performatively, whatever hooks society *did* get in me were easy to shake off once I started studying philosophy and tried to establish a theoretical basis for morality independent of my own personal identity. Then I got confused, because I'd always assumed I was a man, but it turned out there was absolutely nothing backing up that assumption.

I think we need categories because phenomena *must* be abstracted into concepts to discuss them properly. Imagine if I had to explicate the full extent of my gender identity every time someone asked what I was. ""Agender"" might not be perfect, but it gives me something to strive towards until I find something better. But maybe I'm wrong, and maybe you're right - I'll test out your theory in my life and we'll see."
