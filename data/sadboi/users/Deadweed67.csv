But i cant seem to finish albums like piper gates at dawn or the final cut or a saucerful of secrets. I never could. I get to a certain point and i'll skip the song or just stop it completely and change to another album by Floyd."

DunderMifflin,eqpx9gw,t3_bz1ov9,1560206488.0,When I rewatch it I feel like proud for him. He was just happy and wanted to be with holly. So the episode doesnt make me feel sad anymore. It just makes me feel content because he got what he wanted. It is like how he is crying when He is sad that he knows he is leaving but as soon as holly calls him he cheers up.
Battlefield,eqpwwga,t3_bz2tsw,1560206218.0,I love bf4. Im testing out 5. Get 5. And 4 is like maybe less than $10. Get that too if you can. 4 is really good.

Battlefield,eqico4f,t3_byj9w1,1560084272.0,I loved Bad company 2. BF3 was amazing.  BF4 was just fucking fantastic and i still play it sometimes. Hardline was fun but forgettable. BF1 was good but I stopped playing it because it got boring.  I am trying to get into 5 and I downloaded ea access because i want to try out V first and I still cant get into it. Im gonna try one more time. If i cant get into it ill never play it or buy it. Thing is battlefield games are games i loved playing but they just got boring recently.
assassinscreed,eqicdn9,t1_eqgmb8k,1560084099.0,"Hell no dude. AC1 was boring af. They should remake it again no joke. I mean if you liked it congrats, but it was so boring and repetitive.

depression,eoer9rq,t3_brffm6,1558505352.0,I had a nervous breakdown two years ago and i was in a toxic relationship and shit went so bad. I never wanted to reach out to anyone. My sister thought it was best if I was admitted to the hospital and now I feel like everyone talks about me and they all think I wanted attention or want attention. Funny thing is I hate attention.  And I dont ask for help because I fear any kind of rejection. I did go to a psychiatrist but the meds they were giving me felt like they didn't work and they were making me sick. And my therapy wasn't working and I stopped going for several reasons and yeah I should go to speak to someone but even when I spoke to a therapist it didnt seem to do anything but make me feel more ashamed of who I am. A doctor I had that helped me in the hospital just was rude to me. I asked my ex for help at the time we we were together but she made it worse all the time. She was the first that I ever felt connected to but even she hurt me so bad before and after our breakup. I hide away in my room and I have been for a year now. I work from time to time but less now and I tried to make friends but fuck that. It never works out so that is why I need to stay away for good

I didnt really enjoy the song too much before. Idk. I judt have heard itntoo many times and then too many people just only focus on that somg when they say they are nirvana fans. I dont think they are fake fans but they just havent explored the other nirvana songs but then i reheard the song again at work and i was doing late shift and i fell in love with the song. Everhthing about it is perfect and I dont care now if everyone only talks about it. But everyone should listen to other nirvana songs. I fucking love nirvana. And i will thank Kurt Cobain for eternity. Literally if i do reach old age I will always remember Kurt Cobain."
