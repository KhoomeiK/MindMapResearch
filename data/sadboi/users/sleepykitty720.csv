Her work is good but her temper and emotional intelligence is poor. I, however, am a high performer at work who is compassionate of others who aren't as able to keep up. I may know what needs to be done and easily delegate tasks by *asking* since we're all a team, but I don't go around *telling* people what to do just because I say so - I take the time to explain the reason and usually people are receptive to that. The ESTJ gets really judgmental and thinks 'well, if I have to explain it or you are asking, you must be an idiot and not worth my time' and will literally walk away.

I have witnessed the ENTP shutting down the ESTJ with a ""why are you talking to me like that? you're not my boss; we all get paid the same"". But it happens again and again and I wonder why the ENTP even talks to her."

I'm so sorry you're experiencing this while you are just trying to be a new mom and figure things out for yourself. You're not being ungrateful. This sub gets your frustration. 

I think it's time to create some boundaries. Talk to your husband about how you're feeling and explain it very calmly and clearly so he understands and can sympathize. Maybe he can help communicate to them what you need. He needs to support your side of this.

When the grandmother comes over unexpectedly, don't answer the door. Create rules like they have to call and ask before they come visit. If they come to ""help"", delegate tasks and ask for what you need, even just to get a break. If she doesn't fill your requests, say that you thought she offered to help you and that if she isn't going to help, you need to focus on the baby and you do not want visitors/company right now. Tell them straight up that you want to be left alone with the baby if that is the case, even just for the day or week. Make it about you and the baby. That is your priority so make it clear. There is nothing wrong with that. If they have a problem then they are the problem. They have to deal with that. You don't.

I hope you start feeling better. Don't let your emotions bottle up inside, but do find a way to communicate them before everything blows up. I say that from personal experience."

Sometimes I'd surprise myself with how much more I could eat after feeling full. I didn't realize for a while that I was emotionally eating and when I realized it, it made me more sad.

I'm now on a healthy diet and only eat when I'm actually hungry. Try to get your emotions out either in therapy or exercise or both. Try replacing one thing with something healthy and gradually replace most of your diet so that it works to help your body and not hurt it. If you eat healthier foods before junk food, you will get more *full* off the healthier stuff and there won't be as much room for the junk food. Also incorporate more vegetables and raw food like fruit. They can make you feel more full and last longer than meat and junk or processed foods. Don't deprive yourself either. It's ok sometimes to have a doughnut or treat yourself to some fries.

Good luck! You can get there. I think once your mental state changes, so will your eating habits."

Possibly due to the asshole jerk you said she's with. It's not up to you to make her happy. She should be supportive of your choices. 

It turns into toxic behavior because they don't allow you to be yourself and make your own decisions. Taking time for yourself is understandable and if she doesn't understand that, it will just show that she is more concerned about her own feelings than yours. It's ok if she doesn't understand and would be hard but boundaries make it so you can continue having a relationship with someone without it becoming  unhealthy very quickly."

If she gets home and everything at home is done (pets are fed/groomed, house is clean, landscaping is done) then that means she doesn't have to do that overtime work when she would normally have to if you were working. Who cooks dinner?

I mean, if you did nothing all day I'm sure then she would notice your work. Maybe list everything that you do and ask if she wants to take any of those chores off your hands or if she'd rather have you handle them all. I think it's fair for her to have a couple house chores that she does. Not to mention caring for the pets creates those bonds and she should be involved with their care too."

Also, you can record while you're not home. So then that way it won't feel like you're spying or trying to record underage girls.

I don't know your relationship history but regardless, it's your choice to forgive him or not. Maybe this will be his lesson learned. Sounds like he has been trying to prank you for a while and finally pushed your buttons and overstepped too far."
childfree,fbhyf97,t3_edi1yv,1576885663.0,I feel you! I can't even go out in public with my friends who have kids for this reason because I end up acting as a tag-along babysitter. Ugh!
GilmoreGirls,fb8g5rk,t1_fb7ye5j,1576613195.0,"I totally agree with this. The revival episodes are way too long and almost movie length, so compared to the OS it felt very empty. In the OS, so much happens in an episode that I was expecting a bigger storyline. I just rewatched the revival in a day and a half and it felt very focused on theatrics than the actual storyline. Like, one long play is okay for the writers to get it all out but you can't just have Jess reappear only to have like 5 lines! Lol I guess I was emotionally invested in the OS but the difference in writing and the amount of content is painfully obvious."
GilmoreGirls,fb5loqj,t1_fb5dyf1,1576529923.0,Agreed.
GilmoreGirls,fb5l8dm,t1_fb5f0vl,1576529695.0,"Totally. She was super spoiled and privileged. Logan let's her know this in season 7 I think, when they attend a ""boring"" party filled with rich people and Rory writes about it.

If she had earned some respect and had more dignity and insight into her actions (through punishment or discpline) then she could have a better moral compass. She complains about things that happen to a lot of other people her age but she still has many options. It's kind of why I see it as karma that she can't find a job. She kind of acknowledges that people continuing to assume or tell her that she'll be fine and make it etc, gets to her head so she doesn't ever really have an honest view of reality. 

In season 7, she turns down the first writing job for the one she really wants and doesn't get it. That's reality. But instead of realizing maybe she made a mistake, she seems to complain about not getting the job she wanted and that maybe because she declined the first job, she felt she should have deserved acceptance at the job of her choosing. But season 7 sucked altogether so idk if it was the writing at the time and then ASP ended up having to spin it off in the revival."
GilmoreGirls,fb5jsth,t1_fb5bttm,1576528952.0,"I agree with some of this and see where you're coming from but I also see how it would be for the people letting you live with them. Like if I were to say no smoking to someone living in my house, that is a definite no go. Picking out clothes for them is a clear crossed boundary.

I think what ended up happening in this situation is that Richard and Emily were naive about Rory being their perfectly well-behaved grandchild. They had no idea she was sexually active. Things that became problems for them were not issues that Lorelai had with her. Lorelai, given her history, was much more open to Rory doing things like being sexually active because they weren't ""as bad"" as what Lorelai did at an even younger age.

So given Richard and Emily's expectations, of course even Rory was still having a lifestyle that was seen in their eyes as ""wrong"" and because they felt so strongly about their own ways of living, Rory became a ""problem"". Lorelai knew all of this too, as shown when Richard goes to deliver her dollhouse and asks for her help with Rory."

hatemyjob,fap4y6p,t3_e9a38v,1576279975.0,Jfc. I usually wonder what goes on those peoples' (your boss's) lives to warrant such hostility to their employees who are literally there to help. May karma bless him.

depression,famgcn9,t3_e9w3yy,1576203204.0,"Tell me about it. In another sub, I was having to defend a guy showing emotion about his wife's risky pregnancy and other (probably older/more traditional folks) were saying the guy should grow up and is immature for showing his emotions.

It's a crazy epidemic of expecting men to ""be tough"" all the time. It's moronic because EVERYBODY has emotions, no matter who you are. What we resist persists and it's so stupid that people think certain people have to be emotionally whatever solely based on their gender - it doesn't matter. Yes, some people can't control their emotions as well as others but emotional intelligence comes after being able to feel, assess, and express them in the first place.

It also has to do with MBTI personality type and I believe in zodiac as well. Everyone shows their emotions differently, often based on their personality type just like everyone has different ""love languages"". My husband is an emotional type I love him for it. My dad on the other hand like never shows emotion, even in pictures - he doesn't smile. I don't think we would be given emotions if we weren't supposed to use them. You will find people who appreciate that side of you and your ability to express yourself that way."

depression,fam6wcs,t3_e9w5z9,1576197013.0,"Thank you for sharing. Dental problems make me feel very very low and I'm glad I'm not the only one. I am in my early 30s.

Be grateful you can afford to get it fixed and be hopeful that it saves your tooth. I let mine go too long because I couldn't afford it and now I have a gap in my smile that makes me insecure because they had to completely removed the tooth. I got it grafted for an implant but now can't afford that so I just have a gap in my smile that I am trying to get over hiding.

It makes me feel like a failure but also healthcare is so fcked right now."
depression,fam64g1,t3_e9hksr,1576196491.0,"I feel this. I am seeing how self-care really is important. Try starting with doing one thing for yourself that makes you feel better. Like taking a long bath or getting a haircut. Also, making a gratitude list helps a lot. Once you start having a better perspective of the things you are lucky to already have, it grows and becomes a bigger focus than what you don't have. 

I know it's not easy but a good place to start. I have a planner that has a spot on each day to write down what I am grateful for and it helps me."

depression,fabexd6,t3_e8f34y,1575922186.0,"They are supportive already by telling you that they are from the beginning, so they should be very understanding of your missed shift if you explain. If you don't explain and be honest about it, they can't fully support you because it becomes a guessing game. I understand wanting to shut down as I've been there before, but from my experience, lack of communication makes everything worse. Good luck! Don't be afraid to be honest!"
racism,fabefo6,t3_e83spw,1575921968.0,"I started feeling that it shouldn't be a generational thing anymore. It's a big red flag when people can't be open to something that exists and is a fact - the human race is comprised of so many different ethnicities and cultures. Being stubborn or sheltered isn't an excuse.

My belief is if you start making excuses for people like that, it is depriving those races of the freedom they deserve."
