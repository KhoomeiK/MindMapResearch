I was at your point a few years ago. Parents divorced, lived with my mum, and shit was miserable. I found drugs, wrong friends, and fucked around till I had my second attempt at 15. Another one would follow when I was 16. Shit will get better, but first it'll get worse. Not gonna lie to you. 
It's gonna be rough, but it's doable. 
I ended up in an institution by eighteen. Shit got real, real quick, and I had to own up. Then I got my own place, straight from the institution. 
I learned of an education to use my experiences to help people that suffered or are suffering like I was or am. Because shit today can still be rough.
But I sit here typing, still kicking. My girlfriend that I met in the mental institution is making some kickass spaghetti now, singing along with 'take on me' by A-Ha. Three weeks ago, I concluded that education with a certificate.
Shit will be rough, believe me. You will feel alone at night, but you're not. My sleep cycle is as crooked as the teeth of a Brit. And I am here. And I want you to message me. Okay? You're not a burden, you won't be a nuisance if you text me. I want you too. And you'll get through this."

Used even more drugs to fix a lifelong depression, lost the goals to live and the goals of my future. Flopped and almost succeeded in ending it all three times. Then I turned eighteen.
Got myself into an institution, got into a relationship.
