Here's something from an article that touches on the origin of this:

>The scapegoating of Jews has been a widespread phenomenon for over two thousand years. Probably its most damaging example is the claim by many Christians that all Jews throughout the centuries are responsible for the death of Jesus, the alleged son of God. This early scapegoating was partly fueled by the apostle Matthew who introduced the notion that the Jewish contemporaries of Jesus claimed responsibility for his death by saying, “His blood shall be on us and on our children!” Such an extreme accusation meant that in these Christians’ eyes, Jews were the embodiment of absolute evil: they were both capable and guilty of committing deicide. The accusation of Jews being the embodiment of absolute evil has, in turn, become the core motif of anti-Semitism over the millennia."

Exercise,f131gcf,t1_f130qqn,1569151261.0,Thanks for the tips.  Not sure if I'm breaking a sweat from it.  I do it for 10 minutes which is about when my body feels close to giving out.  My goal is to do 10 minutes ever two hours six times a day.  Would it be better if I did 5 minutes at a time if there was more intensity?
