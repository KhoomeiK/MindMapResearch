Anxiety,fq9ngpl,t3_ghiqy2,1589202938.0,I have this problem to a T. I constantly feel like I'm walking on eggshells inside my head. I got to the point where I just didn't want friends anymore and kept to myself so that I just had a very small circle to limit this issue. I'm getting a little better but it is so hard. I'm so sorry you're dealing with this too. You're definitely not alone.

You made the child too, and now she has to suffer because she's the carrier? You get to go have fun and enjoy yourself at your brothers wedding while she's in pain and suffering even though that child was your making too? She has had to be the one carrying the child and has had to be the one going through the awful symptoms that pregnancy brings for many months. The LEAST you could do is be there for her. What if roles were reversed and you had to carry a child that the both of you helped make, you were scared and in for a lot of pain and emotion, just to be left alone to deal with it on your own. Having other family members there isn't the same at all. That is too much pressure on her."
