For me, I've learned that doing things to boost my serotonin levels greatly reduces the amount I care, so I truly think my social anxiety is primarily caused by a chemical imbalance in my brain.

AskReddit,fpwp29l,t1_fpvvafb,1588967374.0,"This is inherently untrue. Even if someone is ""the right person"" they aren't a perfect person. People screw up. Life gets busy and stressful. People deal with sick parents and losing jobs and other really stressful life events. During those life events it can be easy to get complacent in your relationship. You stop spending as much time together. Or one partner grows a little resentful that the other one is spending too much time at work. Living life with another imperfect human is difficult. Even when you love them. It takes effort to make sure you're putting enough time and energy into the relationship.

It's not always hard. Sometimes life is going well. Everyone's happy. Nothing is too stressful. You're both happy and healthy, etc. But life comes in seasons. There are beautiful summer seasons, but then there are hard winters where one partner loses a parent and is grieving. It can take a lot more work during those difficult seasons. But one thing I've learned is that it always comes back around.

AskReddit,fpwo7jr,t3_gfnmo4,1588966929.0,"Because love is ultimately a choice and an action, not a feeling. Feelings are fickle and change all the time. True love is so much more than that. It's a constant unchanging choice and action for each person in a relationship.

I actively love my husband and choose to love him every day no matter how he changes and grows, and he does the same for me. We've been married for almost 10 years. We both went into this saying divorce is not an option and that's how we live and love each other every day. We go through hard times, but we've made the choice to love each other and work through our problems no matter what.

My husband is able to work from home, so we have lost zero income. We have zero fear of him losing his job because he works in risk management, so his job is literally dealing with the virus and how it affects the university he works for.

He no longer has to commute to work, so we are actually saving a ton of money on gas/tolls since he has over an hour long commute to work each way

We also got the $1200 stimulus which went right into savings.

So while I'm sorry for everyone else, this quarantine has been awesome for us."

Here is the summary: 

The film follows five simultaneous, loosely linked plot lines, that intertwine and scramble together. A man ([Tadanobu Asano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadanobu_Asano)) keeps killing his wife ([Reika Hashimoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reika_Hashimoto)) and burying her in the woods only to find her alive, furious, and waiting for him when he returns home. A suburban family's life is disrupted when the father ([Ittoku Kishibe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ittoku_Kishibe)) is permanently hypnotized into believing he is a bird and tries to learn how to fly. A trio of aimless youth pass time by burgling houses. A murderous advertising executive ([Kyōko Koizumi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ky%C5%8Dko_Koizumi)) tries to imagine ideas for commercials. The stories clash together through the intervention of a thuggish hitman ([Vinnie Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinnie_Jones)) and his translator ([Yoshiyoshi Arakawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshiyoshi_Arakawa)).
