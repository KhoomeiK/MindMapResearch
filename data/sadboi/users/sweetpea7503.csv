Your sisters boyfriend didn’t make that call; your dad did and he shouldn’t have tried to bully your brother to disinvite the boyfriend. It’s a wedding and he wants the important people there (you, your sister, your father) even if it means the A$$hole (the boyfriend) is there too."

I stopped receiving calls from “the IRS” after calling them to the point they stopped answering or would pick up and hang up. They struck a nerve when I got a VM explaining if I don’t respond they were coming to remove my kids and arrest me. I called and made similar threats and got hung up on. I called back about 35 times that day.

Clearly she knew you were the one she could trust to follow through and be strong enough to uphold her will. It sucks you have greedy family that want what they want now.

At the end of the day we hugged bye and there it was that look. I texted him later and asked what was with the look. Come to find out he had a crush on me and we’ll seeing him outside of work he was looking pretty damn good to me too.

AskReddit,ewwqsgb,t1_ewv3231,1565833076.0,"Here I am hitting my mid thirties and I’m more of a daddy’s girl now then I was growing up. My mother tarnished my relationship with him after their divorce. I realized entirely to late that I only saw what she wanted me too. My father being the man he was and never defended himself with words to me or spoke negatively of my mother. I guess that’s why it took me so long to hear what he told me. He told me he loved me by never missing a weekend with me, he told me he loved me by teaching me how a lady should be treated, he taught me the value of a dollar and how to manage a bank account, how to drive a car, and even how to take care of it so I didn’t need to depend on anyone, he let me stumble and never spoke negatively to me about my failures. I am beyond grateful that I finally opened up and started asking hard questions. Things weren’t what I was told by my mother. I can’t go back but I can take advantage of every vacation I get to go see him. I get horrible depressed when leaving. I can’t do enough for him while I’m here. I hate seeing his health decline as while as his quality of life. But while I’m around he puts on his brave face cooks me breakfast in the morning and plans my favorite dinners before I even get here. My biggest fear is that every visit may be the last."
