Lithium is a very good drug if you tolerate it and will have minimal sideeffects if you are on a correct dosage. As said before thirst and urination is unavoidable but not hard to deal with. Shakes can usually be fixed with a lower dosage. 

Zombiestate, meh. You have a disorder that makes you experience life a bit more...volatile.  You can live with being a little dull."

I would ask if they know how stress feels. They do. I would then describe how my stress is triggered much earlier than theirs and remind them of all the weird physical ailments that I had over the years and how they all seemed to have their root in stress. 

Stress at work is for some people something normal but for me it makes my skin break out in hives (and my brain break out in episodes) and for every time I get it bad it gets even easier to trigger. Normal people dont freak out over stuff I freak out over. I need a special workplace that caters to my needs and inability to cope, but I can take some hits if I just work 50%."
