mentalhealth,fqbhiu6,t1_fqbf8vk,1589237088.0,"I have Aspergers myself. I have superior ability that I pay attention to details. My child needs help. There is no correct diagnosis if parent input is ignored.

How do you explain a therapist that says no your child is not sensitive to loud noises while I witness her run away from public bathroom because she can‚Äôt stand the loud hand dryer? That is called gaslighting when someone denies the truth and tries to convince other people that the truth doesn‚Äôt exist.
Gaslighting is a form of emotional abuse.

The dangerous thing on Reddit is when people try to convince others without knowing the details.

By this, I would have to tell you to stop replying. Because if you go further, it turns into gaslighting and harassment.

Now, I have to block you .

First thing first, my child has issues that make us go to a therapist. I know some people cry when they get a scratch that would heal in 1 day. Probably those are the people you think about when you write your post.

Aspergers assessment does exist. Otherwise, everyone would just say they have or don‚Äôt have Aspergers.
Sorry your are all wrong .

Later on the therapist OFFERED aspergers assessment.  What ?! Did not I request that at the first time?
How can I write a thank you letter ? He might drive vulnerable people to suicide by gaslighting. If it‚Äôs physical health, it‚Äôs like a doctor performed a brain surgery without telling you it was a brain surgery while you requested him to perform a leg surgery because you were injured on your leg. Then later on he said , ok let‚Äôs now do a leg surgery.

This is a cruel , money hungry, crappy behavior.
You can walk away but the doctor will do the same thing to others . Now can you walk away? Not me.

There is an Asperger's awareness group on Facebook. Many of the members think they have Aspergers but they sound very much like NT to people who actually have Aspergers.

My lawyer talked with the judge and the defendant‚Äôs lawyer behind the door. I never knew what they talked because she never disclosed it to me and I have fired her right after.

However, after that talk with the judge, my lawyer started talking nonsense like I never let my daughter talk as if I was covering up a made up story. But the 11 years old defendant was found guilty at the criminal court 3 years ago. However his probation is over so I am pursuing a restraining order to protect my daughter. She also accused me several other things as if I were the criminal.

I was confused because I hire lawyer to help me and  my lawyer‚Äôs change of attitude was unexpected . We went in front of the judge afterwards, I thought we would have a hearing but there was nothing other than colloquy questions that I am satisfied with her service and fully understand. I thought it is a process I have to go through to start the hearing but there was no hearing .

I am not sure how bad the damages are because I never got information of what was discussed. I have a continuance hearing in a couple of weeks. I am wondering if I could argue that I didn‚Äôt fully understand the colloquy questions. I am also worried if the continuance hearing is worth anything or things were actually already set in stone."
