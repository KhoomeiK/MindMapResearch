I'm okay. Like I said it's been a long time like this and I feel fine atm. At first, when these started, I was pretty scared tbh."
Anxiety,fqj55nj,t1_fqizdq4,1589405184.0,"Sounds alot like Anxiety man. I wouldn‚Äôt pay that much either if were you. When having an anxiety attack bp can raise pretty high, pulse too. And 140 is not deadly or anything if only having once in while. 

People tend to get this constant subcounseus worrying state after their first attacks. That‚Äôs literally anxiety. Worrying wtf was that and checking vitals and reading all kinds of shit. Thats how health anxiety starts. 

Just try to relax. I would also check if theres heart problems in your family. But if those were heart attacks u would be gone already i think. Your bp is okay too bro."
Anxiety,fqiyroc,t1_fqiunhu,1589402714.0,Yeah it can be annoying. I just try to ignore em & they'll fade away eventually. Maybe try some stretches or exercise for mobility?

Anxiety,fq6owdf,t1_fq6mjyn,1589135688.0,"Yeah man i usually just ride it out. I mean the worrying makes it worse. Everything points to anxiety & I know I have it. Just hard to believe that symptoms get so bad sometimes. I'm just chilling you know, but the body does its own thing and does not wanna relax. My brain is all messed up.

Also if you think you can get peace by doing some tests definitely go!

Another thing. Have you been having it for long? I've been having these worse symptoms for 1.5 years now at least, so idk if'd be brain tumor or MS it'd prolly worsen and worsen all the time. I still have good days when i feel normal. Then the symptoms hit like a brick."
