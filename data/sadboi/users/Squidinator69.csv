2. Velma - The brains. The girl who uncovers the meaning of all the clues and shouts ""I got it"" when everything comes together. Mystery Inc couldn't function without her.

3. Fred - The man with the plan and the van. His various traps have succeeded on many occasions (mostly thanks to Scoob and Shaggy luring the bad guy).

4. Daphne - She was originally a damsel in distress but has since become some kind of martial artist. She plays many roles in Mystery Inc, mainly supporting her friends and keeping everyone motivated.

5. Scrappy - In movies and shows where the rest of the gang isn't present (Boo Brothers, Ghoul School, and Reluctant Werewolf to name a few) Scrappy becomes the brains and also a fighter, who isn't afraid to run up and chomp on the bad guy."

In Scooby-Doo and the Samurai Sword there were Scooby-Snax vending machines in Tokyo.

In The Mystery Begins Shaggy creates them from eggs, water, flour, cocoa, sugar, and dog kibble for texture. 

Scooby-Snax have gone stale before, like in Zombie Island, and when eaten we can hear crunching, so they're definitely some kind of biscuit, at least in texture.

Warner Bros. licensed Scooby Snacks as both an official brand of doggie treats and as a human-consumable cookie snack. Vanilla wafers, similar to Nilla Wafers were packaged and sold as Scooby Snacks in Suncoast home video stores.

Well, that's all I can contribute"
