BPD,fk3esln,t3_fg6p0s,1583829977.0,"I'm going to tell the side of the bf (which I experienced). My ex was always really jealous. There were some really overreacted scenarios by her because of jealousy. She cried when a female friend of hers asked me a ride to out hometown or when I gave a rose to my mother in my graduation.

I knew her fear of abandonment and low self esteem because of her father actions (mostly cheating her mother) so I spent the whole relationship as a good codependent would behave, doing everything to prove that I'm not like her father.

Eventually I became attracted to a friend and felt really bad about this, but never acted. The problem is that I told my ex (because I always told everything to avoid her not trusting me and believe or not I would never cheat).

So, even when everything was resolved, she would use this episode in every possible way to turn around and blame everything on me.

BUT, she confessed that she also was attracted to a friend of hers some years before ""my episode"", but since I'm not ""jealous"", that was totally fine for her. (She even broke up with me twice in the same year, one because she was in doubt and the other one because I would spend three months abroad working). 

Last year of the relationship, finding people attractive was not a problem anymore. I remember us spending the day in a shopping mall and rating people (men and women) by their looks and laughing about our ratings (so maybe this can work for you guys).

But if it is not bearable and this keeps leading to fights, there is nothing much to do about it. Loving is trusting. You are afraid of something that may happen but most probably won't happen."

I mean that because I only discovered that my ex have BPD 1 year after we broke up and the last year of the relationship (of a total of 9) I was totally mentally exhausted. If I knew about BPD before things could be different, I guess? Anyway, she just searched professional help after she realized the mess she made going into a rebound and ended up breaking my NC rule just because she said to me that life was meaningless and I was really concerned about her..."

If you have at least half of the field captured and place him the near as possible to the enemy base THEN he is really a threat. Otherwise, he is just a walking decoy. And about the ink, I thought the same at first, but it is one of the best counters to longshot near the base so you can damage him and one of the bases at the same time."
