BPD,fjjx616,t3_fdpysp,1583414745.0,Yes but I don’t see it as a problem or rather I’m just accustomed to doing so since it’s something I’ve done since childhood.
BPD,fj9uaar,t3_fc2mfh,1583159763.0,"Lmaoooo what!! I have several crying selfies, matter fact lemme go delete them."

BPD,fito161,t3_f9llcb,1582725373.0,"Yeah especially when my boyfriend does it. Don’t know why or what im feeling but often times i get triggered and the worse of me comes out. Sometimes with other people I feel are smarter/better than me, I immediately change my mind and agree with them about whatever the topic was, which I hate bc it’s like I can’t feel confident to stand by wtf I said."

socialanxiety,fdqpk9z,t3_emn5gs,1578672119.0,"Ha true. I can’t ever be myself or I creep people out with my awkward vibe and blow any chance of furthering friendships. I suck at one on one’s but even when in groups I fade away in the background anyways. It blowsss but I’m almost 25, getting used to this life."
BPD,fdbvm16,t3_ekdjm9,1578262671.0,Same. I can barely remember stuff that happened yesterday let alone full memories from childhood. Only bits and pieces and sometimes I even feel like I’m making shit up lol.
BorderlinePDisorder,fd39rw0,t1_fd3855s,1578156118.0,Definitely gives me some sort of comfort in temporarily disappearing  and pretending I didn’t just cause a shitshow online. Stay strong love.
BorderlinePDisorder,fcql25i,t3_eifnca,1577887892.0,that and i disable my social media accounts whenever i feel some type of way lol.
BorderlinePDisorder,fcg4qm2,t1_fcg41mg,1577636443.0,you’re too awesome lol thank you!
BorderlinePDisorder,fcg41ct,t1_fcbwo08,1577636332.0,"Wow, yeah totally similar situation as me! Except I haven’t allowed her total control of my life like that, hence the fights and why we are so on and off. I have long been tired of her and how much work it is being her friend, the loneliness is what brings me back. I sometimes think I’ma piece of shit so I’m deserving of that one friend life has given me. But after our last fight I’m def feeling everything you said about “feeling lighter” and not anxious to respond to her beck and call. I want to stay gone, I just hope I don’t end up brushing off our last fight and seeking her just to have someone to talk to. :("
BorderlinePDisorder,fcakudq,t3_egus0p,1577571190.0,"24 also and I literally just dumped my only friend because of some stupid fight. I wanna keep her out of my life this time, but the fact I have severe social anxiety and can’t make a friend to save my fucking life is prolly gonna send me running back to that toxic ass friendship."
confession,etg0w93,t3_cbglxf,1562781617.0,Lmao my boyfriends older brother was so jealous of him when he was born so he would do all kinds of mean shit to him. Even got caught trying to throw him out of a window.
