I don't really trip with people anymore I tend to have very, very emotionally complex introspective journeys that can be very dark and it tends to be more ""serious"" than other people's trips, this is fine for friends who know me and what I deal with, but not all my friends mostly the more open minded ones.

Not to be confusing but I would also suggest lowering doses first, to see if you can find a sweet spot in the low range, perhaps even micro-dosing.

microdosing,flh44qb,t1_flg56sw,1585155730.0,"Alright if we're doing this, lets do it... First of all you've changed your argument to say that it's a 1:1 ratio, regardless of size of the dose. Which in the context of generally speaking, is correct, not gonna argue that....

HOWEVER Your original argument is that larger doses maximizes profit, that's what I was arguing, I'm not arguing in generalities. I'm arguing from a realistic sales perspective.  Which in my head, that takes the following assumptions on the market:  


1. Not all customers will be taking this forever
2. Beginners ARE going to make a decision between doses
3. A significant amount will not be growing their own mushrooms (will have a set amount they will use for the preliminary experiment).
4. There is some resemblance of budgeting in their overall decision to MD

If they are planning on taking it forever, grow their own, and don't care about budget, then dose doesn't count.  My understanding of the MD community is that this isn't a lifelong endeavor, not all growers, and that not everyone that does this can cut as much money as they want.

If you can influence their decision on the portion of your market that doesn't have an unlimited supply they're taking forever (which I would imagine is the majority) then it's beneficial to influence their decision to need more purchases of lions-mane, than more purchases of mushrooms, the product you don't sell.  Therefore telling people to split up their doses smaller would increase the chances you make more sales."

It was terrifying but it didn't ruin my day or make my anxiety worse it just led me to agree that it was time to get ready for battle and to increase my positive input to this world that needs it.

Obvious lead here is the brain considering the conditions you've discussed.


There's a possibility you might just need to eat a stupid amount, half oz or more. But a glaringly obvious risk is that if there was some issue before that clears up and you're on a half oz, and you trip at the normal users tolerance, you will be catatonic and absolutely in psychosis.
