TheHighChef,f2ppalo,t3_de05no,1570348050.0,"- egg noodles

- ground turkey

- frozen broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots roasted in a separate pan with the turkey, seasoned

- all combined together, at this point I intended to add Alfredo sauce but it was moldy because my dumbass forgot to refrigerate it after opening. So I had to improvise: ketchup, hot sauce, Parmesan, mayonnaise, salt, pepper. 

- added more parm on top! Wish I had another form of cheese but my fridge is pretty desolate at the moment. College lyfe. 

Tasted pretty amazing considering... everything
