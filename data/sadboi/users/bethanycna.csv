She eventually got a metal plate to reform her skull and she could walk and talk when she left. She was very monotone, slow in speech, and got a tad bit confused but she was so amazing to me. 

There was also worst bedsores I have EVER seen. A man came to the facility thinking everyone was gonna try to kill him and ""break his little pee pot off"". He would try and fight you for who knows what reason. He came to us because his 94 year old brother was caring for him and couldn't handle it anymore.
