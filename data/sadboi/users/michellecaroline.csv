Man it’s been brutal. I’ve got chronic Lyme disease and I’ve had it for years. I don’t remember ever being bitten by a tick. It took 8 different doctors and 2 years before I finally got a correct diagnosis. It comes with joint pain, extreme fatigue, migraines, facial paralysis, vomiting, fainting, fevers, anxiety, insomnia, brain fog. The worst it got was when I started having seizures. After trying so many different treatments I’ve finally gotten better. It’s been a long road but that’s what makes me a warrior."
