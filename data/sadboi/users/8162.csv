FortNiteBR,fqmkpf8,t1_fql5311,1589479043.0,"honestly it‚Äôs a really good idea nonetheless, would be like an unlock able side quest in the battle pass on certain tiers.

would be a really cool idea if it worked like mw in a way, like deal a certain amount of damage and you get a wrap/xp/bullet designs that only you can see(like the blue trail he has in the concept), and you keep getting better rewards by doing headshots, or long shots, or multi kills, and the last level would be a new model for the gun that only you can see.

honestly i really fricken like this concept and i think epic needs to see it."
FortNiteBR,fq8bogr,t1_fpvvdcr,1589162572.0,yeah lmao double pump would actually be balanced right now if it was only allowed for gray-blue rarities. pretty much just a tac with a smaller reticle and slightly slower shooting speed
FortNiteBR,fq8blzl,t1_fq81yep,1589162528.0,exactly. it makes no sense for the gray pump shoot 2x slower than the tac and do less damage.
FortNiteBR,fpvtbtd,t1_fpug7qb,1588951457.0,"yeah and that‚Äôs what epic thought too. they didn‚Äôt want the pump to have to be balanced for a faster fire rate and rather wanted it to be a hard hitting slow shooting shotgun.

but please

understand that if you were to use a controller on a PC, not console, PC, it boosts your aim assist to pretty much be aimbot(because of the way less input delay and smoother gameplay it‚Äôs way easier to aim).

it‚Äôs to the point where people who use controller on pc don‚Äôt even use their shotgun because they know that using an smg is much more viable with their aim assist.
