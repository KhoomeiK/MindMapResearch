I, as many people do, hold a grudge for certain things that happened. A lot of folks think it's just UPMC, but as you say, it's the industry as a whole. Anytime you're managing care for hundreds of thousands of people system wide, you're gonna get treated like numbers. And their capital management (stashing away ""profits"") is to give them staying power into the future, which is quite uncertain. 

It's a double edge sword, not all bad. Of course they pay very little taxes but they're the largest employer in the state. Many people don't realize just how good we have it with health care (I'm not talking Insurance) In this region. Way better facilities and doctors than any city our size, and even bigger cities.

My biggest gripe comes from my employment there over a decade ago. I was privy to board meetings that pushed profitability per bed, expansion of testing for business' sake, and just overall blew me away how heavily they ran it as a ""for profit"" business, all while pushing this image that they're just in it to care for people. But it's a business and I do feel that they should lose their tax exemptions. Perhaps though if they did, they would not quite the leader in medicine that they are."
