Blackfellas,fqfhk99,t1_fqfdhe7,1589325012.0,"Ok, this isn't right. Those businesses were targeted because every business was targeted. The damage disproportionately affected Asian American business because they owned the majority of the property.

>At the time of the riots, many businesses in low-income, majority-black neighborhoods like South Central were owned by Korean immigrants, who were able to purchase them for low prices from white owners who were leaving the neighborhood

Your article also points to the fact that this was mostly a result of the rodney king murder, not an attack directed against asian Americans or any speficic groups. Not to condone the damage that was done.

>Tensions between the two groups came to a head on March 16, 1991, when Soon Ja Du, a Korean store owner, fatally shot Latasha Harlins, a 15-year-old African-American girl. Du accused Latasha of trying to steal a bottle of orange juice. The girl threw the juice on the counter and began walking away when Du shot her in the head. That incident, along with the acquittal of the officers who beat Rodney King, contributed to the anger that exploded on April 29, 1992.

If you read to the end of the article you wouldn't have seen the riots as a personal attack on your community.

>We, the black and Korean communities, were pitted against each other without understanding each other. We have to engage each other. I learned that the powers that be will try to divide and conquer. This is why I'm engaged politically and why I'm a liberal,"" Yoo said

I never heard it was targeted against Korean Americans. Distrust was bred in the community and the fallout was terrible, but it wasn't indicative of a larger prejudice against the Asian community by black people."
