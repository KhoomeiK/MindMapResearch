Louisville,f13tfm0,t3_d7ijgh,1569164934.0,This happend to me at bonnaroo when they had these stupid 7up light up bracelets people were throwing them... it gave me a black eye. Dont be that guy
birthcontrol,f13qbw0,t3_d7r4db,1569163748.0,I think one is fine if you're worried... plan b really messes with your hormones I didnt have my period for 2 months after taking it and stress doesn't help.
CPTSD,eztikv7,t3_d24vjj,1568131168.0,I found a new therapist when mine suggested that my S/O was the reason I felt the way I did. Not my bpd not my complex trauma not my anxiety or depression... my literal life partner who has been nothing but patient. I know were both not perfect but to put the way I'M feeling on someone else isnt ok bc were all responsible for how we feel. I'm so proud of you for finding a new therapist!!! There are some pretty crappy ones out there but on the flip side there are some super amazing ones! It just takes time to find one that gets it and doesn't push unsolicited advice or their own bias on your treatment

AskReddit,ew2jrdx,t1_ew1vzks,1565048461.0,It's like Kawasaki disease... people thinknits some made up thing when I tell them I had it.
BPD,evmiu8t,t1_evmi8ov,1564608624.0,Ok I'm 100 percent going to check this out. I've been reading the book adult children of emotionally unavailable parents when I'm well.. dealing with her emotional unavailability but sometimes it's hard to come down from my emotions to read so thanks for this!
BPD,evmimfn,t1_evmhlv0,1564608543.0,I really appreciated this. I think it's hard because in this toxic environment I'm constantly invalidated and unable to express and feelings it's all just kinda building up. Thank you!
CPTSD,evjnpi1,t3_ck31zi,1564566120.0,"Yeah that's honestly what started my eating disorder- the disconnect. My official diagnosis I got a year ago was anorexia, BPD, anxiety. They still have to give you that diagnosis if you even still have thoughts of an eating disorder, I'm a healthy weight now, but I think about it almost every day... be careful refeeding yourself one you escape the environment that makes you sick. ‚ù§"
BPD,evi1nel,t1_evfpfww,1564535596.0,I had severe panic attacks when I started dbt. They were like the I think I might be dying kind. I'd get pale and pass out.. totally a real thing when you confront deep shit
explainlikeimfive,evdwzjz,t1_evd37yj,1564449636.0,"You remind me of a bomb anesthesiologists  that I work with. So much detail, loves explaining everything. I love it."
BPD,ev1l7lv,t3_chybri,1564160641.0,Yes. In high school I was the girl who made things up and stole everything she owned. Until my mom came into school high on meth screaming causing a scene. Only the people who saw that believed what I was dealing with. This one kid specifically was there for all of these events so he knew I had it rough. He always wrote me cards telling me he hoped that it got better and I could get away. His kindness and validation was one of the reasons I never killed myself when everyone else talked so bad about me and said mean things.
birthcontrol,eukw0y6,t1_euks1pm,1563893812.0,Well since you don't like hormones kyleena is more localized. There's always a chance it could expel since your paragard did twice! I really liked the arm implant the most if I'm being honest I didn't like being able to feel my IUD. I had a few less side effects from the arm implant as well.
birthcontrol,euh4sde,t1_euh4gi1,1563820808.0,"I should probably mention I also track my cycle when using condoms and try to avoid super fertile days! I feel you on no hormones.

My uterus was too small for paragard."
birthcontrol,euh4gi1,t3_cgc1v8,1563820637.0,"Hi! Mine did this too! Twice in a row! I did nexplanon right after, then kyleena! My body does not like progestin only methods but I thought they were both amazing methods of BC.

Currently using condoms as my fiancee doesn't mind. I feel the best I've ever felt. Minus hormonal acne lol."
birthcontrol,etur6f4,t1_etuofi9,1563218331.0,"I'm in nursing school! I happened to be at the hospital on Saturday while this was all happening. It was a low grade fever of about 99 farenheit. Could have also been the pain from my migraine. Took some excedrin and that helped everything went home went to bed woke up fine.

Edit: BP and temp can vary pretty significantly with pain. Could be the hormones could be the severe migraine I had."
nursing,etsid9i,t1_etshctu,1563146403.0,I love that! I'm in the OR right now and people will be like I'm allergic to ________ why? Because it gives me a headache. Lol

birthcontrol,erqwj17,t3_c39em8,1561153856.0,i love nexplanon loved. Only negative was it killed my sex drive. But BC never had the effect on me when I was younger! Ive had 3 IUDS my body pushed every single one out.
birthcontrol,ern51n1,t3_c2wj1o,1561044778.0,Hey I have caresource as well (ohio) it should not be this difficult. Planned parenthood does them but i had my first one put in there and they placed it incorrectly. So My reg obgyn has put 2 iuds in all i had to do was call and schedule an appointment caresource literally does not care/doesnt want to deal. Sounds like ur drs office doesnt want to deal with them.

So I appreciate all the kindness. I had one girl try to push me back until my bf raised his hand and i said see thats where im going. No need to be so aggressive.

bonnaroo,equlpwr,t3_bzhq90,1560331740.0,2 years ago I held up the line because I forgot my spare gun clip (unloaded) was in my trunk. They tore my car apart (which is nice to know they take it seriously especially these days). Safe to say all the people immediately behid me were very grateful they got light searches since they searched my car so thoroughly. Its hit or miss.
