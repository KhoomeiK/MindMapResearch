So start with this: it is out of your control, so what you can do right now is stop worrying and make yourself feel better. Identify that you are looping and step out of the anxiety loop and do something that makes you stop reasoning, that reconnects you with yourself, with your intuitive side.

But the thing is you can't escape from your responsibilities ever because you are ""mom"" (hardcore mom in this case) 24/7. When do you have time for yourself? When do you have quality time with your husband? Without those things how are you expected to escape from the role of mom and enter a safe place where you can let go? Your husband needs to understand that and stop pressuring you. Pressure only makes you feel as though you are ""needed"", as if your husband is just another child that needs your care. That needs to stop.

I agree with this comment above completely! You need to find an action plan to stop caring for the children 24/7.

Different people have different boundaries as to physical contact. Some people are very touchy, others not. But in the end, that is no the real problem here.

There are two real problems. One is that she views your boyfriend as a source of reassurance and she depends on him, proven by her having panic attacks when he's not around and probably explains why she ""must not be left out"". 

The other one is that your boyfriend does not respect your boundaries. Not asking you before inviting her on dates. Telling you what you want to hear to placate you until you ""get over it"". 

As many other said, this is a boyfriend problem. The girl is maybe naive or maybe she knows what she's doing, but ultimately she only cares about relying on your boyfriend. And your boyfriend is enabling her. It's time to have a serious conversation with him."
