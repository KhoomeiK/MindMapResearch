Also it's their content. They can do whatever they want. We're not their employers. They're giving their content out for free and depend on donations. It's like when people yell at artists, that they don't like the pictures they draw and demand other pictures as if they were paying them. If you commission and pay someone for content, you have all the right to complain. 

And hear me out, that doesn't mean, we can't have discussions about what we like about their content and what not. But we should still try to be nice and understanding about it and not mean and demanding how some (not all) posts and comments on reddit, twitter and instagram were."

I really don't have to drag them. The players are super nice and amazing people who do everything, I ask them to and try so.much to make it fun for everyone. I just want the stuff to make sense in game.

I'll ask them directly again about what motivates them and to give me a backstory that's more than 3 sentences. XD"
DungeonMasters,fdq3rce,t1_fdq2vjn,1578653429.0,"This actually sounds good. 
Some of the stuff needs more explanation on my side tho, I guess. The organisation takes quests from basically everyone who wants to for a small fee and then they pass them on to the characters. The characters get paid by the people who gave them the quest and not the organisation. 
(The agency type of work is just a cover for another thing that the organisation tries to do what the players don't know of). 
I could probably have them say ""the fee was all, we could afford and we can't pay you but we really need help"" 
Later on they will have other reasons to go on the adventures (aka basically the end of the world, what else could it be) but for now it's a bit difficult. 
I asked my players to write me a bit more backstory for their characters so I get more stuff to work with and motivate them."

I just love how Garfield is obviously the lasagna cat but the description doesn't have a race for him.
THBs' expressions while bullying people are amazing and crack me up. 
I love the art in general and I pay extra attention to it because Carey didn't spent hours and days and months, drawing those pictures for us to look at them one second and only recognise the speech bubbles.

Also, I have a friend who can't listen to the podcast due to his adhd because he'd have to listen to every episode 300 times to get what's going on, so the graphic novels are a great help for him."

I found that it helped to feel taken care of and feeling extra safe with the person, which was never truly the case with men because there hasn't been much effort to get me comfortable. 

I'm not saying that was because of them being men. It's probably a coincidence. I just think it's hard to find someone who makes us feel 100% safe and cared for."
BPD,fcjl6d6,t3_ehhajj,1577692142.0,"I've learned to communicate a lot of the stuff that is going on with me. I totally agree with the other comment.

I feel like it's even more important for people who have BPD to communicate with their friends and SOs so they get a feeling for what's happening and how things can get avoided or handled before they escalate because of misunderstandings.

That went a bit off topic but yeah.. Make sure to step back for a while and live your own life a little, when you're becoming too attached. And make sure, he knows why you're doing that."
DungeonMasters,fca4ici,t1_fca2eaj,1577562944.0,"The thing that angered me is that they wouldn't have cancelled, if I hadn't asked and that they knew it way before the evening before the session. 
The players who didn't cancel got Christmas presents in game. The others won't. Now that we're back to the regular schedule (and the one, who rarely showed any interest and probably pulled the others down with him, left), I don't think this will happen again like that. 
Your suggestions are very helpful. Thank you. I want my players to act on their own and don't just follow along the story, I prepared. The four who didn't cancel, are really into the story and I feel like they're extra careful not to ruin what I prepared. I hope, I can reassure them.

BPD,fc88s67,t3_egp1q3,1577529435.0,"Similar experience here
Everyone started sharing their Wishlists on Instagram and other social media and I used the opportunity to get gifts for all the people that I thought as friends or at least close acquaintances of. I also crafted things for other friends. And two of them thanked me. They sent me pictures of their packages and were really happy. Others didn't mention it and one even put a picture of his gift in his Instagram story saying something like ""got my first Christmas present"" without tagging me or thanking me at all. He also didn't get me something back. I don't expect people to go crazy and thank me with tons of heart emojis or whatnot. But it would be nice to get a ""Hey thanks for your gift"" or something. 

But at least, I got some gifts for Christmas. I'm terribly sorry that you were so overlooked and ignored. That's awful. It makes me want to send you something. You deserve a gift. Please feel hugged! (if you're comfortable with that)"

My gf just skipped over the conversation and didn't read it at all. And my best friend has family business today and because of Christmas forgot to cancel. The one that left already missed other sessions without cancelling and tbh I don't really miss him in the group. 
From now in I'll sum up every convo in one message and tag everyone it is applying to. I should have done it like that earlier. But I'm learning and that was one step of it.

The other 4 players are invested in my story and one even joins to listen and watch, even when she's not playing. I'm really thankful for those 4."
DungeonMasters,fc501y9,t1_fc4w05v,1577436159.0,"You're probably right, I don't even try to deny it. Usually it wouldn't matter, if someone cancelled right before the session because of the system, I thought of. What made me so sad was that it was 3 players forgetting it all at once when I thought, it had been clear that everyone was supposed to play that day. 
I don't even prepare that much, it's usually not more than 1 handwritten page, a map and a NPC drawing (which is totally unnecessary, I know). I just want the plot to evolve slowly around the adventures and that the adventures themselves aren't something they'd seen everyday. I want them to be able to make theories on what happened and what's going on. The players are still in the spotlight. I do my best to get their backstory involved. I'm a bit dependent on that they don't ignore that one organisation, that's true. But I could work something out, if they just said fuck it.

It probably takes a little practice to not get frustrated like this anymore."
DungeonMasters,fc4zit8,t1_fc4qi0z,1577435394.0,"Two of my players are crazy about the game.

One of them nearly cried of happiness because she was so happy with our group because no one was toxic to her (she made some pretty bad experiences), two others at least know how to use a calendar, say in advance when the date might be difficult to them, so that we can find another one real quick, and over all pay attention.
Then there are my girlfriend and my best friend who seemingly have going on so much in their head, that stuff like that happens and usually the others have to pull them along. What's not bad per se but frustrating when I put extra work in to make them a nice Christmas special. I calmed down by now and I can see it all in another light.

I don't know what that thing is, but when he can't change it and there's nothing, you two can do about it, then maybe, you just don't fit together as a couple. Maybe both of you would be happier with someone else. Breaking up doesn't mean, leaving in bad blood. The relationship isn't good for you how it is at the moment.

I myself was hiding away for at least 30 minutes before I had the strength to join Christmas supper. And my family isn't even that bad. 
You did amazing and it's totally okay to stutter and being slower at math when under so much pressure. If they judge you, it's their problem, not yours. Just breathe. You're doing amazing!"
BPD,fc2alk2,t3_efsgbr,1577348830.0,"I broke up with two of my ex-SOs. The first time was very bad. I felt so guilty and we both cried a lot. The thing was, I didn't break up because she did something wrong, I broke up because I didn't want her to suffer anymore under my (what I thought it was at that point) depression. Somehow we managed to stay best friends. This was the better way for us. Of course it's very rarely like that. 

To break up with my last bf, I waited for myself to feel numb and emotionless, so it was easier. I cried a bit but more because it was expected. He didn't put the least of effort in the relationship. I felt like I was the only thing, keeping it going. So he basically had abandoned me already before I broke up with him. When it was done I felt better. He was giving me nothing. 

My advice for your breakup is: Keep telling yourself how he wouldn't learn the first time and how he probably won't learn now. You're better off without him. You can be strong by yourself! You can be happy by yourself! You don't need him! Especially if he doesn't respect you and doesn't respect your boundaries. You can find someone else, who listens to you and tries to make it work together with you. Breaking up isn't easy. It never is. And it's even worse for us. 
But there are people out there who aren't toxic, who respect and help us without breaking and without hurting us. People where we can be ourselves. We all need to find those people and surround us with them.

You can do it! I believe in you!"
