Now with people and friends getting pregnant and having babies. It's hard, I think we all can understand how hard it is on this subreddit. I think I started not to resent when I saw a post about a fb friend giving birth. I was just about to unfriend her, when I remembered that she had also had a loss at over 5 months. And even though she was very happy to have a healthy baby, she was also scared through out the whole pregnancy. She constantly thought that she was going to lose this one, and it wasn't fun for her at all. I've also learned that a lot of my friends have had miscarriages, and had kept it to themselves. Even the ones that have never experienced lost, would constantly worry so so much in their pregnancy.

What I'm thinking about right now is if you both were too spilt up in years to come, you can easily stop contact between the both of them. Which would then just break their hearts.

I've been treated in similar ways when family members have gone through the same when I was a kid, and it just made me develop anxiety and I felt like I was treading on eggshells. The thing is, the grieving process can last for so many years, so what happens if your daughter has to deal with that? What happens if she doesn't even want to go to your house in the end?

It's something where you know was always a possibility, but you don't actually think that it would ever happen to you. I lost twin girls when my waters also broke early. I hated calling it a miscarriage, as it felt so much more than that. I'm not going to lie, but when your won't be pregnant anymore, it's going to be horrible and hard, and you'll be crying the most random times. It's okay to cry, and it's okay to talk about it whenever you want to. Put your self first right now. But the days will get better. There will be bad days, but the good days will happen more and more. Rest as much as you can, as your body will be very weak okay. I'm here if you ever need a chat."

It's a miscarriage/stillbirth awareness bracelet band for my boyfriend and I after the loss of our girls, and there is badges to bring awareness to miscarriage/stillbirth as well. I want to get them all. It doesn't get talked about at all, and I'm not ashamed of what's happened."
Miscarriage,f7w2hdx,t3_dxo2s9,1574029190.0,"I'm so sorry for you loss. I had a loss at 19+2 weeks to twin girls. I had so many family and friends that had baby girls right after. I remember on the twins due date, one of my cousins announced that she was pregnant with a girl. It's still so hard, and it's harder when I see twins. I wish that there was something that I could say that will help with the situation, but I don't even know what to do myself. üòî"

Sometimes, no matter how scary it all is, we just have to force ourselves out there. My boyfriend and I had been friends on Facebook for awhile before I had messaged him first. We've been together over 2 years now. I know that rejection is scary, but putting yourself out there will give you better confidence. It took years for me to find my boyfriend. A lot of heartbreak and rejection, but it was worth it."

AskReddit,f5vgms7,t3_dpgrq1,1572488895.0,"When I was a teen, I was extremely overweight. I came home from school and took my clothes off to put in the laundry basket. I had this massive belt that I was looking at and for some reason, I decided to put it around my breasts as I wanted to try and flatten them as I hated how big they were. I tightened the belt more and more and my breasts looked flatter and flatter until i started struggling to breath. I tried to take it off but it wouldn't come off. I started to panic and I became more and more dizzy. I couldn't hear as well for some reason lol. All I kept thinking was that my Mum and step Dad was going to find me naked and dead with a belt around me, thinking I died from a weird sex fetish. I managed to get it off and realised that I was stupider than I thought."

I understand about wanting her again, as you'll never be able to replace her. I still want a babies as well, and not different ones, but my twin girls, and I'm afraid that I'll never have that special love for another baby like I had with my first ones.

I remember being excited last year thinking about how I would dress them up for Halloween this year, or what I would buy them for Christmas this year, but it's going to be a very lonely one without them both. I wish that it would get easier."

One woman commented saying that it was sexual assault and there were hundreds of comments saying that sexual assault doesn't happen to men and that he probably enjoyed it. Imagine if the roles were reversed.
Miscarriage,f485rqg,t3_djgpyz,1571432883.0,I remember having a massive baby bump this time last year and I was very excited to be planning Halloween 2019 with twin girls.

It would be a year tomorrow since my waters broke. Really wish that I could sleep for a few months right now.

Anyway, just because you feel that you're small, doesn't mean that you can't give a woman great sex. I had a friend that had met up with a guy that was the same size as you, and she didn't think that the sex would ever be good, but she said that it was the best sex ever. She said that there was a lot of positions and angles that made him feel really good for her. Maybe you can look online about what you can do? It'll take time, but it's a start."
