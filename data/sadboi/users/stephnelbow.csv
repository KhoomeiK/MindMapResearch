xxfitness,fr2novb,t3_gm7t9r,1589840510.0,"As with anything, it never gets easier, you get better. 

Running rewards those who are consistent. If you put in the time, and the miles, it starts to become ""easier"". If you don't, each run is a battle. 

When I first started, I did intervals. I didn't follow C25K because I didn't like being told what to do. I wanted to listen to my body. So I ran until I needed to walk, then I walked.  In the beginning this was like 2 minutes of running.  Then it got longer and longer.  It takes time, but it happens where all of a sudden you can run a mile no problem."

xxfitness,fr0scy7,t3_glvvik,1589805524.0,"Took the plunge and officially e-mailed my CF coach that I'm putting my membership on hold. 

Yesterday was awful. Started off great. Got a good run in, good food, meal prepped, etc.  THEN FOUND OUT WE HAVE A NEW BASEMENT FOUNDATION LEAK and that ruined the night (epic rain yesterday). Also noticed some new cracks in the concrete.  I don't believe they were caused by me at all, but, I think my lifting in the basement and the treadmill made them worse. ie this house is old AF and the concrete is old AF and my simply being there probably made them appear.  I simply hate this house.  

It's so conflicting. I have all the things to lift, lifting makes me happy, but now I'm all paranoid about it at home now because of how fragile this house is.  Add to that the low ceilings that prevent some movements and again, I simply hate this house.  But, I know I'm not comfortable going back to the gym yet, so holding my membership still makes sense. 

We'll see. There might just be a lot more running in my future this summer and less lifting"

Dumbbells are great to work on stabilizer muscles, and at isolating muscle groups or hitting different angles, but barbells are more efficient at building muscle mass over time. 

Lots of women here have taken the plunge to walk into the weight section if you want advice on how to conquer that fear.

I had insane nasal polyps in 2018. Needed sinus surgery that but a ban on my running (running was hard with them obviously as well).  Once I got the all clear to run, i couldn't even do 1/2 a mile. Took me a month before I could run a mile again.  My lungs were just trashed. 

Then, fall 2019, right before the Chicago marathon I trained for, I ended up in the ER for blood clots. Basically bed ridden for over a week with intense pain, chest pain lasted a month. Again back at step zero with my running.

Bret is all about building up womens behinds, with a goal on bikini/figure comp type bodies. Aesthetics. 

Powerlifting is about getting strong AF focusing on three lifts, bench, deadlift, squat.  In the simplest description. 

If you want to get into powerlifting that is FANTASTIC, but Bret is not the guy to help you. The FAQ has many programs to follow.  There are also loads of coaches who may assist getting programs together for you.   Absolutely no need to cut weight, the focus will be on following a program, eating well, and gaining strength.

Hopefully some of the items I liked for maintenance are still worthwhile information! 

If all the users saw the # of posts we remove daily it would probably be suprising.  There's a reason there are so many mods in the sub.  You are correct though, some do make it through that don't offer nearly as much to the sub as others. 
You are always open to tag/report the post to the mods if you believe it doesn't meet the requirements! This does help us see the ones that might have slipped through"
