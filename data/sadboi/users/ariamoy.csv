gatekeeping,f4jbza5,t1_f4i7ttb,1571616732.0,"Lmaooo. Same, I used to take my late fiancé to a Mexican restaurant in Indiana cause it was his favorite food, he was crazy about it. I’m peruvian, I never had mexican by that time, but eeeekk, it was bad, lack of flavor and anything that I can imagine... and I’d just chug the food happy cause he was happy.

Same thing happens with Peruvian food... we are hard to please."

Good luck 🍀🥰"

I did that once and it worked like magic.

Much love"
