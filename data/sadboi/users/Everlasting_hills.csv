UkrainianConflict,f00nx4y,t1_f00g6jp,1568304149.0,"I'm just some guy on the internet and opinions are like assholes. But so far as I can tell, the geographic position of Ukraine means that any move toward NATO protection is completely unacceptable to Russia and, whether we like it or not, they will act to prevent it; it's effectively a foreign military alliance's incursion into Russia's sphere of influence. I don't think that NATO is interested in a direct confrontation with Russia and so they will let Ukraine be torn up by ethnic conflict, Russian propaganda, and separatists in the East for however long until the country can join the EU/NATO of its own accord without military assistance. Russia, meanwhile, has no such desire for restraint except that it is not seeking an immediate war with NATO forces. 

There are two potential ways to address this that I'm aware of that won't leave Ukraine in a destructive limbo for the foreseeable future: either have Ukraine be neutralized from all military alliances, meaning no alliances with Russia or NATO would be permissible without consequences, or have Ukraine shed territory in the East to Russian influence while simultaneously joining an EU/NATO alliance in the rest of the country for protection against Russia. The problem I see with the former case is that I don't see Russia respecting such a neutralization of Ukraine -- Russia will continue to bombard Ukraine with propaganda and encourage separatism in line with Russia's Eurasian goals and NATO will continue to sit back and make supportive statements without helping materially. There are obviously major problems with the latter solution too, dividing a country and conceding to a violation of sovereignty, but I don't think there are any good solutions for Ukraine. Western Europe could give a bunch of military help and secure the country from Russian influence and that would solve it, but they won't do it because they prefer not to act directly and prefer to avoid provoking a Russian response."

>None of these positions you've listed are incompatible, you just don't fully understand what the positions are.

I fully admit I don't fully understand Chomsky's positions; in fact, I stated that I'm puzzled about them and don't know exactly what to make of them. I've seen him state these positions many times in recent years and my confusion about them has been bugging me lately, so I wanted to state these positions where they could be addressed and this seemed as good a place as any.

>How are these incongruous things? How does NATO, a military alliance of neoliberal western hegemony help democracy flourish? Your ideas of democracy (western, liberal oligarchies) are not Noam's idea of democracy (direct, cooperative, an increased share in the fruits of society for the workers as well as a direct say in the politics of governance.)

Both western Europe and Russia are oligarchic ultimately, but Russia is more obvious and overt about it. I honestly don't disagree with Chomsky's opinion on this matter -- Putin's interests are more aligned with the people of eastern Europe than are the western Powers, who are mainly concerned with controlling energy -- I just don't understand how his view fits together. I don't think that Russia has any interest in democracy per se, whereas western Europe is at least nominally committed to it.

>Crimea is the most misunderstood geopolitical move in the US tbh. The people of Crimea largely wanted it, and have been largely Russian ethnically for centuries. Imperialism isn't just ""a big state does some stuff"", there's a dedicated definition on the left that I'm sure Chomsky uses.

I agree, Crimeans want to be part of Russia and not Ukraine, much like in South Ossetia and in Karelia. It appears to be imperialism to me, though, as it disregarded Ukraine's sovereignty and was only possible because Russia has might and Ukraine doesn't. What's the definition of imperialism you mentioned?

Thanks, in any case, for your thoughts on the matter. Like I said, I've always had a lot of respect for Chomsky, but scratch my head at some of his recent positions. I'm not a libertarian socialist, though, so I'm ignorant of some of the background."

We should be charitable and patient when we point out errors, though pointing it out is important. My priest points out heresies to me in person when he, my wife, and I discuss the Holy Trinity, for example, and I don't take offense at all, knowing that it is to protect me from confusion and error. People can be too aggressive about it, especially when they devolve to anger and name calling, which is unfortunate and a result of the current division in the Church.

I don't think that Cardinal Kasper's words will move anyone who uses the word ""heretic"" when correcting others -- he's part of the Sankt Gallen Group, which traditionalists look at with suspicion and opposition, due to the group's secrecy and being the tip of the spear in terms of Modernism."

The priest can be in a state of mortal sin and lack sanctifying grace, but wiki at least says Faith is still necessary.

Edit: scratch that, it talks about Faith of the recipient and not the priest. Here's a better article: https://www.traditioninaction.org/HotTopics/f060_Intention.htm. It's something I will have to research more, but I can't outright deny the conclusion of the argument without more knowledge. It all comes down to the necessity spelled out at the Council of Trent that the minister of the sacraments intends to do what the Church does, that intention uniting them to Christ. If the priest does not believe that Christ is present in the Eucharist and that the purpose of the parish is not for distributing divine food, then how can they intend to do what the Church does?

Here's the actual text of the argument I heard on another forum: ""A modernist priest, who does not believe in the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist has no supernatural Faith (formal heresy is a sin against Faith, and sin against Faith causes loss of all supernatural Faith in the soul, and God is not under obligation to restore it), therefore he does not intend to do what the Church does, therefore the final cause of transubstantiation is not present, therefore transubstantiation does not happen, therefore those who attend such a mass do not eat Christ, but bread."""

I'm new to Catholicism in general, but here are my observations.

Traditionalists are opposed to the heresy of Modernism that seeks to undermine, the Sacred Tradition of the Church and reverence for the Blessed Sacrament. Some points: love of the Traditional Latin Mass, belief in and practice of all of the teachings of the Church (e.g. no contraception, no abortion, Adam and Eve were the first true people with spiritual souls, communion every Sunday, Christ truly present in the Eucharist), frequent confession/communion, reverence for the Blessed Sacrament -- through genuflections, receiving the Host on the tongue, etc -- no meat on Fridays, commonly three hour fasts before communion, etc. Those are typical exterior characteristics. The heart is a desire to be faithful to the Sacred Tradition of the Church and be reverent to Christ."

relationships,ewetv5d,t1_ewdtp2g,1565337528.0,Woohoo! Good move! Way to go! Take care of yourself.
SuicideWatch,ewemtcb,t3_cnx57j,1565329285.0,"What you're feeling is so painful and I really feel for you, having also faced very scary moments with severe depression and overwhelm. Reach out for support from family, therapists, NAMI, the crisis hotline, and here. You deserve support and people are here and elsewhere to support you! You obviously work hard, care deeply about your family, and have a good heart. Best wishes!"
Needafriend,ewekw5b,t3_cnxio0,1565327379.0,"I'm sorry for how your friendships and relationships have been rocky lately and for how you're feeling. I can really relate when it comes to anxiety, depression, and a feeling of isolation. That was the greatest pain for me in life. I'm wishing you the best and I'll pray for you!"

relationships,ewdbvzx,t3_cnrw0t,1565298282.0,"Leave this secret relationship behind. It's no good in the long-term. Even if she left her boyfriend for you, that would create a precedent for her to leave you for someone else. Move on."
CatholicPhilosophy,ewdbake,t3_cnrq23,1565298011.0,Anything by Edward Feser is gold. Attacks on God's divine simplicity would have us cripple God's depth and do away with apophatic theology. Good on Feser for defending the mystery of the godhead.
relationships,ewd7mtr,t1_ewcr3j6,1565296365.0,Agreed. Not having kids could be one of your biggest regrets in a couple decades. Just go in and embrace your role as a patriarch.
relationships,ewav3z3,t3_cniojb,1565252602.0,"Please find a way to leave him. You are worthy of a relationship where your feelings are nurtured and you're not treated like garbage. You should not be told by your significant other that they can just leave you like it's nothing. You are not nothing. And if he were truly repentant of his behavior, he would stop drinking and abusing you emotionally."
offmychest,ewasj52,t3_cnifnq,1565250854.0,"Talking about it is the first step to overcoming it. We all face these temptations. They become more dangerous and toxic as they grow. But you've identified that, which is like a little miracle."
offmychest,ewaie4u,t3_cnhi24,1565244328.0,"Confession is a purifying thing. I hope you feel peace.

Keep in mind that you were young and we all make mistakes when we're young. And the fact that you seem to have contrition about it and a desire to admit it here is admirable."
Anxiety,ewai1t7,t3_cnhgsb,1565244125.0,I feel you. We live in crazy times. It's like there's a tug-of-war for the public consciousness with extremists on both sides and people's brains are getting pulled in half in the process.
offmychest,ewahix4,t3_cnhe2u,1565243813.0,This just warmed my heart.

offmychest,ewae4o9,t3_cnh4vy,1565241809.0,Woohoo! That's wonderful. I'm so happy for you both.
Anxiety,ewaboqb,t3_cngwth,1565240362.0,"Absolutely! The sensory stimulation of the water is very helpful. Promotes mindfulness. When my wife is overwhelmed or I'm having a meltdown we'll often cajole each other into sitting in the shower. 

DO IT!"
