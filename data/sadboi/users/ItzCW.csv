HomeworkHelp,ff9mms2,t3_esf7d9,1579716178.0,"For the first question:

In total there are 30 children in a class. 10% of those cycle meaning that 3 of them cycle, the same applies to the 10% that take the bus. It then says that 25% of the remaining take the car, this means that 30-6 (children that cycle and take the bus) = 24. Divide this by 2 to get 50% and then do this again to get 25% which = 6 children. This means there will be 18 children remaining (30-12)

This means that 18 children walk to school.

There is another way to do percentages and that is just divide the number by 100 and then multiply it by the percentage (for example if it was 25% then by 25). But it's really just whatever you prefer.

Tried to explain this as best as I could so you could try the rest yourself, good luck."

Also, if you look closely on the first page with all the ""I am 37"" 's you can see at the bottom that there's an alteration where it says ""I am 27, 37 is coming"" - pretty sure it's intentional but at the moment I'm just looking for things that stand out to be honest. My mate also thought there could be some link to the bible but this is all just speculation at the moment. Sorry to be not much help."
