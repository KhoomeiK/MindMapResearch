I find one drop rule very old school. However, in the US even if you’re even part black they would consider you just black. Look at Obama. People classified him as the first black president.

So, I was still kind of confused on the system when I got there. The school told all the international students about the school system. However, I still needed time to adjust and learn the slang that my professors sometimes used.  

What was also different was to have more of a  higher level of thinking than what I had been taught in undergrad. There was one class where other graduate students had to ask many questions because we had no idea how the professor wanted us to answer the question.  I wasn’t used to that type of higher level thinking.  I  also wasn’t doing so much research in my different classes in undergrad. My undergrad’s system was really fast. So, research couldn’t be like three or four weeks long. It had to be less and my professors would tell me to move on to the next thing.  

I knew nobody going to my grad school. However, I made friends in my classes and met other people as well. I liked my grad school’s environment.

I’ve had that issue with people. I told them I was mixed and the next month or so they say I’m just full black. I have Asian features. My first younger sibling is around the same shade as me and her friend told people that she was concussed when she was telling people she was a quarter Japanese.

My teachers and some of my classmates never believed me that I was part Japanese. I also think the people that told me I wasn’t part Japanese have never seen what Blasian people can turn out to be. People expecting mixed kids to just be light skinned.  I selected my Japanese grandmother to prove to my teacher that I was mixed because he skipped me when I told him that the group at my table should be called mixed. He skipped me and only asked two people. Both of those kids were light skin. I hope he learned his lesson how mixed people can come in different shades. There was another kid in my class that was half white and half Mexican. People always told him he was just Mexican. 

My mother knew a family that  had eight Blasian kids. They were part Korean and part black. The skin tone ranged from very light to dark brown. They are still Blasian.
