depression,fh7f4s9,t1_fh54c0n,1581328612.0,For me its because it a familiar feeling. I feel sadness more than anything and when I feel happiness I feel ontop of the world! I love both feelings which is terrible.... and  I should go to therapy but its too damn expensive here in the states. Only time I could ever afford it was the free sessions at my university and they werent helpful at all after the 10 sessions. How do people afford it... im curious. I wish this was something that is free.. adult life sucks.
