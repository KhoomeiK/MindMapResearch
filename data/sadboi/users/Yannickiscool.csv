ontario,fl00sbh,t3_flimby,1584686960.0,I know this does not fit the narrative but I live in a busy city and during rush hour today I went out to get some essentials and the roads were empty. It took me about the same time to do what I wanted to as it would on a Sunday afternoon. The clerk that served me has gloves on and the store was empty. I haven’t been outside in 4 days but I might be the exception.
