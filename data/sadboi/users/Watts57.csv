You are coming in between the father-daughter relationship. it's obvious to everybody that  You don't want her you just want the man.

As you putting up cameras in your home you can do whatever you want. you using it as evidence to get her in trouble that's a little crazy. What you're doing is you're pushing her away from her dad just so you can get what you want a childless Life.

Liz shouldn't be destroying your stuff that is wrong."

A lot of my family members are afraid of dogs . So when we have family get-togethers I never just let them run around when my family members that are afraid of dogs are here. I always put them in the kennel lock the kennel and close the door to the room that they kennels in. It's just out of respect of their comfort level in my home. Not everybody thinks dog's are cute and that's okay.
