Advice,fqnqnqj,t3_gjkuzy,1589499611.0,I’m from Quebec and it’s the province with the most cases (even tho a very large portion of them are in Montreal) and it’s the one that seems to reopen the quickest. It’s absolute non sense to me tbh and people just didn’t care that much about the rules in general so it’s about to be a true shitshow this summer.

The only thing that gets more and more hate is the quote « Ça va bien aller » or ‘it’s gonna be alright’ because the ones saying it don’t realized that they are very privileged in their situation and that for a lot of people it’s not gonna be okay."
CasualConversation,fpyej9t,t1_fpye969,1589002524.0,"It’s basically a gas station but we call it convenience store because we sell others things than lottery, alcohol and cigarettes. Before corona, we had mini hand sanitizer bottles at like 1,89$ CAD and they were gone in like a day. Then we had some like a month ago for 5,50$ CAD (same format) and they all were gone in 2 days."
CasualConversation,fpye00f,t1_fpydm6u,1589002223.0,Well most stores will ask to use some provided hand sanitizer but we just happen to have a sink near entry so it’s less expensive to use soap and water than some hand sanitizer that is so hard to find nowadays :))

CasualConversation,fpy76s2,t3_gg2gx7,1588997508.0,"So glad to work in a place where it is taken seriously. I work at a convenience store and here are what is different from before:

-no more than 5 customers in the store at once;
-everyone entering has to wash their hands (we have a sink near the door);
-obligatory distance of 2 meters between every customer;
-we have a plexiglass panel in front of the registers; 
-No more reusable cups are allowed in the store to fill with either coffee or slushy;
-no more than 2 employees working (usually 1 at registers and 1 doing administrative work);
-We disinfect all surfaces every 20-40 mins in the store;
-Using hand sanitizer after every customer and washing our hands if they gave us cash (or every time we touch cash). 
-We can wear a mask if wished, but I’m in a region with low cases.

There’s maybe more that I forgot, but I’m glad to be in a secure environment and to also have a family that takes the situation very seriously."
dating,fov5zv9,t3_g9loik,1588095939.0,"Well I’m in a state of « we really like each other, waiting for quarantine to be over to see each other and pretty much confirm that we are dating » with a guy (which might actually be my first relationship ever). 
And of course, there’s some excitement when we flirt a bit with each other, but it’s mostly very calm in my head the rest of the time talking to him and I just feel at ease talking to him and being more vulnerable (which I find pretty special as I’ve always had this nowhere mental block when it was time to say what I really feel).
I expected a wild ride when I’d be in my first relationship, but it’s actually like being on a boat on a calm lake. I’ll guess that it is a good sign for the future? (I’m 18F, he’s 20M)"

AskReddit,foioff0,t3_g7id84,1587792034.0,"Well that would be psychological because I’m kinda hematophobic, and gore isn’t as “common” as it was since social media can really make it easier for an evil person to play with the mind of another as it’s now normal to share informations on the internet.

Then, I’d finally buy all of the books I really want to read instead of going to the library.
Then, maybe a 1000$ Steam gift card.
Then, I’d spend on cute stationary.
Then, go to Sephora and buy the most expensive makeup I’d want.

For some it’s just texting."

dating_advice,ffam3fq,t3_esgag2,1579739148.0,"I relate to you so much on that level. Like, why are  supposed to only date people in our “league” and can’t date someone that is considered prettier or uglier? Looks can do a difference, but the personality and morals of a person is so much more important than their appearance. If you want to date a person, you need to love other stuff than their looks, unless you want something shallow and boring. Like I don’t care if I end up dating someone “prettier” or “uglier”, beauty is subjective and physical flaws are often erased by someone’s great personality and morals."
