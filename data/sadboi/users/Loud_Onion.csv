But, in a way, that made it a little easier for me because my mother explicitly taught me social rules and, once I realized that she had taught me ""right"" is wrong and that ""wrong"" is right, I just reviewed in my head what the social rules she had taught me were (for example. If you drop a fork on the floor in a restaurant, make the waiter come over and pick it up) and then examined how I felt about them and how i would rather act in those situations (for example, pick up the damn fork my own self and ask for a new fork)

I imagine that most people kind of just soak up the rules without knowing it, so I don't know if my experience is 100% relatable, but the point is to really examine what you were taught and to figure out an alternative action you would rather do.
