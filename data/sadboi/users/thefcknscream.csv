mentalillness,fc4b4qg,t3_eg477f,1577411584.0,"So sorry to hear that, that's heartbreaking.. Are you under the care of a psychiatrist ?

I have derealization since.. Waw, I don't know when it began but it's been a loooong time, but it got worst with time. But, since two years and a half, I'm seeing a psychiatrist and I discovered a lot of things about me, and with her help I'm seeing the end of the tunnel.

Derealization is kind of a defense mechanism : if I'm using my own words, it's like I'm hiding in myself and I switch to automatic mode. It's like having my eyes closed and yet opened, living but not being ""there"", being non-existant. And at this point you see the benefits of this mechanism : while hiding in myself, nothing can hurt me, nothing can scare me, nothing can shock me. But there comes the worst part : I'm also cutting myself off from love, happiness, laugh, pleasure, and all emotions except stress and anxiety.

That's why this mechanism is ""evil"", because you're shutting down yourself, you lock yourself in the backstage instead of being on the scene, and it demands a lot of will to go back on the scene.. And it's all about will, only about will, and it's not easy to get it back, but it's possible, don't lose hope because as long as you're alive, you will always have will :)."

You know what ? I began to understand those little details just recently. Today's movies do not include details like that, so I learned pretty late cinema was also about that.

It really began with Shining and all of the details and clues we can find, and there's still theories today about the meaning. I remember the first thing I saw by myself was the knives above Danny's head when he's talking to Halloran, then I googled it and a lot of people were talking about this detail, so I was like "" Hmm okay, I love this way of making movies, it's like searching for a meaning in the details of a painting""

When Magda says ""him"", young Elliot lists the obvious answers : ""You mean Mr Robot ?"" then ""Elliot ?"". If we refer to this detail, young Elliot see Elliot as a personality, so we can deduce Elliot has an ""assigned seat"", Mr Robot too. So there's two seats we don't know the owners.
