In the 90s, getting a job that paid well above minimum wage and a college education was incredibly easy. Nowadays, it's nigh impossible to get out from under the mountain of debt college results in (if you go to college when you're able, the way the system works now, your kids will still be paying your 4-year college debt because you'll likely die of old age before you can pay it off).

The sad fact is most people can't even save enough between bills, rent and groceries to have extra spending money. My household of myself and my SO brings in just over 2k a month at our above-minimum-wage jobs, which probably seems like enough to survive on. But then you factor in rent ($650 for 900 Sq ft/mo) electric (between 100-250/mo) water, trash and garbage pickup (about 45/mo) gasoline so we can get back and forth to work (about 50/mo) groceries (~350/mo) and child support for my kids (~300/mo), there isn't much left to save, and that's not even counting other pop-up bills, such as car registration.

You can have all the ideals you want about saving for an emergency until you actually move out of your home and realize just how crushing the attempt to be financially stable is."

1. When the issue is ""God doesn't want you to change your body, he doesn't make mistakes"" respond with, ""Okay but you wear makeup, exercise to build muscle etc., you are not practicing what you're preaching therefore I see no reason to agree with you."" This is especially good against older ladies who put a literal inch of makeup on their face to hide the wrinkles. Maybe remind them the Church outlawed women wearing makeup in the 1800s and earlier for some time, for the same reasons. 

2. When the issue is, ""but are you thinking of how this will affect others"", remind them that they're not thinking of others by pointing this out to you. Again this goes back to the ""Unless you can practice what you preach"" argument.

3. Finally. For the idiots who just want to hate to hate, who you don't know and who don't know you - ""I don't see how the decision I'm making about MY body affect YOUR life, so I don't understand why you feel the need to have an opinion on my life choices."" Refer to the above for further arguments necessary after this.

Best of luck on your continuing journey OP. While I doubt this is transphobia and think this is more a sexist thing I hope everything smooths over soon."

AmItheAsshole,fjjijvn,t1_fjjidc4,1583397715.0,"No, you're right, he really didn't, and that's a good point I didn't really consider. The thing that got me the most was the constant complaints about me being awake and moving through the apartment late at night when I work third shift, like for my 2 days off I'm just supposed to mess up my entire sleep schedule so I could be ""awake during the day like a normal person"".

It got to the point where leaving my bedroom became taboo after 9pm and that's what tipped it for me."
AmItheAsshole,fjji6v2,t1_fjji5c1,1583397222.0,They legally can't because of that police record I mentioned. Even if they wanted to if the cops found him with certain family he'd go right back to prison.
AmItheAsshole,fjji1gw,t1_fjjhzy2,1583397017.0,He has family but they are not well off and some of them are mad at me for kicking him out but won't (legally can't) accept him into their homes. This goes into that police record I mentioned.
AmItheAsshole,fjjhw7x,t1_fjjhv0x,1583396817.0,There actually aren't any shelters in my town. The only one was closed down years ago.
AmItheAsshole,fjjhtvd,t1_fjjhp5c,1583396730.0,"True but if I see people struggling I like to help as much as I can. I don't see how that makes me an asshole. I've been in rough living situations before and sometimes people just need a little helpm
I'm not trying to argue I'm just trying to understand your stance."
AmItheAsshole,fjjhlyu,t1_fjjhhzz,1583396439.0,Because I'm kind hearted and I knew him from before. There was no indication he'd act like this.
AmItheAsshole,fjjhj4g,t3_fds4v9,1583396336.0,YTA. Sorry but if you weren't being actively helped you should have moved out of the line. That's just proper etiquette. You could have moved down the desk a bit to clear a path if it's as wide as you're indicating.

I'll probably officially start the gameplay in April and make it my game for the month at least, and we'll see how far we can take it. Keep an eye here and also in the Meta discord challenge, I'll be posting an update as the stream gets closer."
HaveWeMeta,fjfy7iy,t1_fjfy5d3,1583303982.0,Saved for reference! Thank you!
HaveWeMeta,fjfy3x0,t1_fjfxz4q,1583303886.0,No worries :) I edited the document link one more time to make this clear. Thank you for bringing it to my attention!
HaveWeMeta,fjfxrzf,t1_fjfx9zy,1583303566.0,"2 turn ons and 1 turn off in total from all options, you can mix and match categories.

Example: I make a Sim who is attracted to black and red hair and turned off by cologne.

Or a sim who likes fat and fit people but is turned off by charismatic sims.

It's not very open ended, I know, but it's the confines the game placed on its players. If you're worried about gender to gender attraction, I find using ""makeup"" and ""facial hair"" as turn ons works to enforce gender preference if necessary (Male sims do not spawn with makeup applied and female sims cannot have facial hair)"
