I started taking Dialectical Behavior Therapy, aka DBT.  During my DBT therapy I went to a class and counseling session once a week.  Now, I go to counseling 2 times a week.

I left my comment because you used the wording ""antivax parents"". There are people that are antivax.  However, I believe that the majority of parents who choose not to vaccine their children, make this choice based on the knowledge that vaccines are not 100% safe. That is why I commented. I am sorry my comment was not clear. 

In the USA,the reason there is such a big movement toward vaccine safety is because parents are being told that they are required to vaccinate their children if they want to attend public school. Most parents depend on public schooling and feel like their choice has been taken away. Parents want to be able to have a say as to what is being put in their child's body, especially since vaccines have side effects including death. There are side effects to all of your above examples. However, the difference between aspirin and vaccines is that vaccines are mandatory and aspirin is not. Also, the possible side effects of meds are usually written on the bottle or given to you, in writing, by the pharmacist. Parents are not given the vaccine insert that shares all of the possible side effects. In fact, they are usually told by their doctor that they are safe.

AskReddit,f0p239w,t1_f0o7pti,1568825467.0,"I think you point of view is accurate and important to understand. We are social creatures and want to belong. I can completely understand how someone that feels shunned or ..... Could be vulnerable to any sort of group. Validation, belonging, and camaraderie are effective tools to build trust. All the above is a perfect cocktail for brainwashing. I am happy you had the ability to get out. You should feel proud!"

 I hear you and my heart mourns. I wish you well, as well. I am a very broken person. I hope it works out with this guy. Trust is built over a period of time. My advice is to take it slow. . ‚ò∫Ô∏è"

AskReddit,eyddcqe,t3_cwj2wv,1567016598.0,"1. Self centered/selfish people.
2. People, especially parents, that know they are doing something wrong but continue to do it despite the damage and pain it may cause to others. This applies to so many things but 1 good example would be a parent that cheats.
3. People that choose to live in denial because the truth is inconvenient. Again, this applies to so many things but a good example would be when I discuss the environment or veganism with people.
4. People that act without using empathy. I have realized there is a continuum from which people have the ability to feel empathy. I am on the extreme right. I feel enormous amounts of empathy. I am jealous of people that feel less.
5. Passive - aggressive behavior
6. Devious manipulations

Everything I wrote above is tied together, except passive aggressive behavior. I have a hard time dealing with the knowledge that many people are like the above. We all, including myself, exhibit a degrees of the above behavior. I think what makes me say, ""Man, I f****ng hat people"", the most is when people don't try to evolve and choose to stay the same."
AskReddit,exyqn0z,t3_cuctl4,1566655595.0,Yessss!!!! I am going to pay attention. I love science. I can't wait to be in this world with my new perspective. I am going to learn and participate in things I have never done before. I am going to be multi-talented. I not going to pick just 1 thing to accomplish because there are so many things I want to do.
AskReddit,exl59hr,t3_ctdudi,1566406214.0,"I found it odd but absolutely wonderful that my healthcare was free. I am an American and visited Scotland. While I was there I became ill. I went to the local doctor and was prescribed medicine. While checking out, I was so scared to see my bill. It was all free!!!! I was in shock for the rest of the day.

Also, while I was in Sterling I noticed everything shut down around 7pm. The only places that were open were the local pubs.

I absolutely loved Scotland. I loved the people, towns, and their natural beauty."

AskReddit,eweo3td,t1_ewckk4s,1565330670.0,"I have a sister that sounds like your brother. I realized that she comes to me for advice, emotional support, and to do her favors. I finally realized that our relationship is 1sided. I can not remember 1 time in the past 20 years that I have for any support. In fact, anytime I am slightly vulnerable around her she attacks. I love her but I am no longer going to waste any energy on her. 

The care bubble sounds like a wonderful idea. I am going to draw one. I need to really think about it. 

Thank you for sharing. I appreciate your insight! 
I hope you enjoy your new perspective.
