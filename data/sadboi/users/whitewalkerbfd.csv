Coronavirus,fmda8t4,t3_fuf4w1,1585962887.0,"My two grandparents over 80 aren’t taking it seriously. My grandma smokes 40 cigarettes a day and has emphysema and has been hospitalised with pneumonia in the past. My grandad has been in hospital for various things over the years. They both go out every day to the supermarkets for their daily shopping more like a social sort of thing as they could no doubt get a weeks worth at a time. I live far from them my mother lives up the road. She’s tried ordering them shopping online they aren’t having any of it. “Stop bloody panicking” is their mantra. Even now with the lock down they go out every day. If they get it they won’t make it, the hospital won’t even look at them. But still they do not listen. I despair what am I supposed to do? 😟"

PandemicPreps,fll7l53,t1_fll6lu2,1585255096.0,"I’ve seen children can also get it bad, lower chance but still there is a risk. I’ve got asthma and when I was younger used to smoke a lot so trying my best to avoid it. If one of my children gets it and gets it bad then it’s going to be me that has to go into hospital with them. Then imagine that I get it and god forbid die from it. All because he needed to go to the gym (clearly life n death situation). So that leaves my 2 without a mother and having to then be raised by their father who doesn’t have a clue. I might be running away with myself here but people are dying from it and I’m going to try my best and make sure we are not in those statistics"

COVID19positive,fko5xk8,t3_fjjmav,1584380744.0,I don’t know if I was infected or not but I had a tight chest for 3 days then a slight temperature for a couple of extra days. I’d say 5 days pretty mild symptoms compared to what I was fearing. But I don’t know if that was covid. There was no cough no runny nose etc so not a normal cold. When I get a cold I get it all in my sinuses. I self isolated the house hold. My children had a slight temperature and a minor cough for a day or 2 on and off. I’ve kept them off school. Husband had no symptoms and he refuses to self isolate. Been to the gym today and god knows where else so he’s not allowed back into the family home for the foreseeable future. I have been on top of this since day 1 and I’ve been keeping him up to date. He knows the consequences. He thinks it’s just made up by the media 🤦‍♀️
