industrialmusic,fr5yfos,t1_fr2otuc,1589916762.0,"Great White Death is the epitome of 80's Whitehouse. Erector made marks, sure, transitioning their sound towards something more concetrated, direct, straightforward, but that other album is sheer orgasmic catharsis. Even though not Industrial, and more influenced by Stockhausen than Throbbing Gristle, Bennet & cia produced music that is very akin to that aesthetic. I would suggest Genocide Organ, one PE band that feels more Industrial than anything else."

It's not actually Industrial, but impossible not to be associated with the genre. Listen to the drum of Earth Died Screaming, the exquisite noises on Such a Scream and All Stripped Down, the thick repetitive beat of The Ocean Doesn't Want Me. Waits is pure genius."

Thy fall may last a million aeons, but thou shalt die at last. Because the world must end; Till then, my glorious steed, thou shalt run thy course; thou mayst please thine ear with the crunching of the heads crushed under thy feet. Thy course is long, but courage! Long time hast thou carried me: but longer time still must elapse, and yet we shall not age. Stars may be quenched, the mountains crumble, the earth finally wear away its diamond axis; but we two, we alone are immortal, for the impalpable lives forever! But to-day them canst lie at my feet, and polish thy teeth against the moss-grown tombs, for Satan has abandoned me, and a power unknown compels me to obey his will. Lo! the dead seek to rise from their graves. Satan, I love thee! Thou alone canst comprehend my joys and my deliriums. But, more fortunate than I, thou wilt some day, when earth shall be no more, recline... Man has his tomb, and glory its oblivion."
