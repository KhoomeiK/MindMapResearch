depression,fgnwm40,t3_ezk0ff,1580954490.0,"I found therapy helpful. I think I got extremely lucky though. My therapist and I clicked pretty quickly. We were actually reading the same book at the time. I saw it on his desk so we talked about the book which led us to talk about philosophy and politics, which are two subjects I love. Then from there we had debates about good vs evil, meaning of life, freedom, happiness, all that. He suggested some books and philosophies he thought I would enjoy and might help me. 

I honestly think it’s about finding a person that clicks with you. Like I said I got extremely lucky."

Then I bought back in later because I thought it would rebound with plans to sell if I lost more than 3% just to find out I was locked in my position till tomorrow. So this is my second biggest lose since I started.

Usually I get depressed because of how much of a failure I am and how much I’ve wasted. Then I start to hate myself and get pissed off at myself for being so pathetic. Which in turn I get a huge boost of motivation to change and stop being pathetic. 

Then the cycle starts over probably because I’m bipolar."
