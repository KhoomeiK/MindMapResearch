Yep but ya know, I cannot go to community college because I am an international student so that CC will be expensive for me, they do not offer fin aids. And moreover, I truly understand that Denison is a really good school and also kinda selective too, but the main reason that I want to live on other states instead of Ohio so yeah that why I tend to transfer."
