He ate the whole thing like a champ- I have a small corner to see how I felt. After about an hour and a couple beers, I say fuck it I’ll have some more. Had about half the candy and thought nothing of it. Couple hours later we’re feeling super relaxed and enjoying watching tv; end up falling asleep in the living room. Woke up about an hour later HIGH AF. I started freaking out cause like you, I forgot why I was feeling like this. Ran to the bathroom, splashed water on my face, paced back and forth wondering if I should wake my sleeping bf up and tell him how scared I am and how I think I’m literally dying. I start overthinking about how long I’ve been in the bathroom, and start thinking about how my boyfriend is going to judge me for being in here so long. I go back to the living room and sit next to him overthinking if I should wake him....for what seems like forever lol eventually he wakes up and I tell him and he stays awake with me until I calm down. 0/10 would recommend lol"
