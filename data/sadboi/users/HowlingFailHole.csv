TalkTherapy,fqjgg2d,t1_fqjf71c,1589409591.0,"I totally understand how scary it can be to say something that feels critical, particularly if you have a history of painful relationships as it sounds like is true for you.

I can't say for sure based on the information here, but if he's a good therapist this could be really valuable stuff to bring up. It's really rich material that could tell him a lot about how you experience relationships now and in the past. 

I also don't think it is a criticism to say to him you feel as if he's suggesting you should stay in these relationships (not that it would be wrong even if it were explicitly critical). I think you could just say that you sometimes feel as if he's encouraging you to stay and then you can discuss how that feels. 

I get that it might feel harder to say you worry he gets off on your suffering, so you might not start with that, but if he responds well to you talking about how you feel he's encouraging you to stay, and you feel more comfortable with him, I think the feeling about him enjoying your suffering is probably really really important to bring up.

Like I say, i might be totally wrong and it's hard to say without being there, but if you bring it up it gives you a chance to find out whether he's worth continuing to see. If he is, I think these feelings are great material (hope that doesnt sound dismissive of how they feel to you, though)."
TalkTherapy,fqj9vhp,t1_fqj941v,1589407016.0,"It's weird if he is giving advice like telling you not to listen to people in the internet. Some of the things you've mentioned though sound like they could be more neutral, like him playing back your experiences to you to get you to explore them. It's hard to tell without full context.

Like, him saying 'you could continue to date him' could be a suggestion that you ought to do that, or it could be him getting you to explore the fact that you have the option of not living with him while dating him, to help you separate two strands of something that feels to you like a single issue.

Have you told him you feel like he's encouraging you to stay in these relationships? 

And have you been in situations before where you feel like someone is enjoying your suffering in some way?"
TalkTherapy,fqj8vow,t3_gj8aeb,1589406633.0,"It sounds like you're looking for your therapist to tell you what to do and affirm that these situations are bad for you.

And to be clear I have done that (been open about my attachment and erotic transference) in therapy. I just didnt understand how it was supposed to help, and didnt feel like it did. Sure it's natural for that to be painful, but frankly I don't enjoy that kind of pain, so if there's no benefit to sharing something, and sharing something increases the amount of pain I feel, I don't get what the point of doing that is. Why would I say something that will increase pain if all it does is increase pain? 

And sorry if I sound aggressive. The pain question is a hard one for me because so many of my issues come from being raised to view pain as inherently good, and to see life as just horrible suffering that you have to endure until you die. I'm sensitive to the suggestion that everything should be painful, which I know is not what you said. It just triggers that bit of me."

I'm only challenging this since I am remembering someone recently who was convinced their therapist had made some egregious error by informing the client that they were having a reaction to them (post didn't clarify what). That poster kept saying 'but the therapist isn't supposed to have any countertransference, and they're definitely not supposed to share it!'

But if a therapist is telling a client they feel pushed away or shut out and think that's relevant to how the client connects to other people, for example, that isn't an issue, surely?"

I can see why you would focus on this now, given the circumstances you describe, but I wonder if focusing on that is a way to feel close to your therapist now, to have a reason to think of them and ruminate about them.

There's a reason a lot of us don't say this to our therapists, and I guess a reason why you didn't say this to your therapist when you were seeing her. For me, and I think for many others, there's really no possible response that wouldn't be painful. I see no way this would be a helpful thing to share, but a lot of ways it could lead to pain."

Ugly and disliked as a child but taken advantage of sexually due to her sperginess and curiosity as an adult, developed an inappropriate sexual openness in response, maybe got involved in the kink scene (autism hotspot, enjoyed actually being kind of attractive in a circle where standards were lower), maybe a cam girl, or I guess an Only Fans.

askatherapist,fny7jbn,t1_fnx5aw0,1587355351.0,"Thanks, it was quite disheartening for that to be the first response from a therapist! That's still the view of the only therapist who's replied, isn't it? 'Have you considered that you suck?' Actually in fact I have, quite a lot, that was sort of what I was hoping to do less of with therapy, not more of!

Yeah I am going to say that to him next session I think. I feel like he'll just be like 'hmm interesting', though. I don't know what kind of answer could really change the course at this point but the thought of leaving therapy and just having nothing when I'm still so incredibly unhappy makes me feel so deeply sad. I end up thinking about suicide at that point, not because I'd be sad about not seeing him but because I'd have no hope of anyone ever helping. 

I'm so mad at how bad my experiences of therapy have been. I hate that it's suggested as a way to deal with mental illness so reflexively, as if it's at all helpful. I have wasted thousands of pounds on this and come out feeling so much worse."

I just don't know whether I ought to be reanalysing my life and assuming other people do find me boring, or at least unengaging, when that's never a concern I've had before, or whether that's just giving myself a whole new neurosis for no reason other than not clicking with one guy. Am I deluding myself in my other relationships or am I now letting therapy needlessly make me even less confident than when I went in? It's so hard to know. My boyfriend and friends certainly say they don't find me boring but maybe they're not being wholly truthful?

*I* certainly feel very disengaged, by almost everything, but that's never feedback I've had from others."
askatherapist,fnx099r,t1_fnwrstm,1587328945.0,"Thanks :-). To be clear he isn't sleepy anymore, but was for several months.

The most engaged he ever was was when I brought erotic transference over a year ago (to the point that I would have thought he was interested in me if I wasn't 95% sure he's gay), and now he's interested again because of this. 

Comments like the other thread here from a therapist make me doubt myself, though. Like on the one hand he has done the 'it's not your job to entertain me' line, but on the other hand clearly you can just be a bad client who is dull and not using therapy the right way. 

In just finding it so hard to cut it off because this is really my last shot at therapy. I cant invest again after this, and I've had so many therapists in the last 16 years and he's one of only 2 I've seen long term. The others were so bad I couldn't continue. I'm moving to the other side of the country later this year and won't be earning for at least 1.5 years when I move so this is really it for me.

The chances of finding someone I click with even slightly are already so low, though, being picky about how a therapist works on top of that means I'd potentially have to try out 100 until I found one I could actually work well with. It's just a shit way to end therapy, with the conclusion I am so shitty I can't even pay someone to pretend to tolerate me. I so badly wish I hadn't gone in the first place."

It's odd though because I don't think I'm being delusional in saying that isn't how other people experience me. I'm much more likely to receive feedback in the other direction, like I'm too aggressive or intense. And I've had therapists before who didnt have this reaction.

TalkTherapy,fnp4ex0,t3_g317p8,1587139021.0,"This is a fun thing to do haha. I think the fact that the podcast was in its second season (part way through an endeavour that must have taken up a lot of his time and thoughts, and where he's expressing himself, none of which he'd told you about) and the fact that you found fliers (other people did know, and he was making it public) is maybe about your anxiety (or maybe just curiosity) about your therapist having a life outside of your relationship with him. That's what I get from that and the worry that everyone will find out about him.

I think a podcast where your therapist discusses weighty intellectual topics is a super interesting way of representing both your therapist's inner life and their relationship with other people and the wider world. I also wonder if there was any more significance to that for you, like are those kind of topics things you love (maybe you feel similar to your therapist), things you find impressive but alienating (believing him to be superior in some way), things you believe other people value highly (something about your therapist being high status in other people's eyes) etc etc.

I'm not sure about your bf's role, but maybe you get validation and positive feelings from your therapist, and want your boyfriend to kind of confirm that that's valuable by also holding your therapist in high esteem? Is there something in there about needing other people to confirm for you what you think? Not being able to trust your own judgement about someone? I might just be projecting with that one though :).

TalkTherapy,fnp2ss4,t3_g33nme,1587138231.0,"I would imagine most therapists would be able to deal with your views without feeling personally upset by them. Either they agree with you and don't eat meat, or they are comfortable with the fact they have a different moral view to you. And unless you think you are going to become so powerful an animal rights activist that you completely eradicate the entire meat industry single handedly (and more relevantly, unless your therapist believes this to be the case), I don't see why a therapist would be disincentivised to help you because that's where your ambitions lie.

I think the fact that you consider both of those things to be potential barriers to therapy is probably something it would be very valuable to talk about, though, whether or not you seek out a vegan therapist. I would personally feel interested in whether you often feel that other people's outlook on life is different to yours in such a fundamental way that they are likely to sabotage you if you express yours, and why you feel so uncomfortable about expressing a moral view to someone who doesn't share it (is it that you assume they will be unable to cope with this? Why?). Maybe I'm totally misunderstanding but from your post it feels like you  believe other people will react very strongly to your beliefs. I'm sure many people would and have, but a therapist is supposed to be able to kind of hold their own emotionally, and should be able to cope with you having very different beliefs from them.

What you actually have is one single anecdote. If someone wants actual context on this, they can look into how many people get involuntarily sectioned each year vs how many people are in therapy.

It's also very relevant to look at involuntary sectioning broken down by demographic. If you're a black ma  you are facing very different probabilities to a white woman, for instance. Looking at those figures is going to be a lot more useful than basing this on an anecdote. 

Fundamentally though the guidelines on hspoitlaisation are relevant here unless you seriously mistrust your therapist.

But you want me to present a peer reviewed study to contradict your single solitary anecdote. Of course.

What you are saying applies to just going to any therapy at all. If someone wants to have you sectioned despite you not needing or wanting it, just going to therapy at all is the risk factor there. Whether you do or do not open up about suicidal thoughts or plans is irrelevant. This is a ridiculously paranoid way to approach anything and is actively unhelpful.

Yes if someone lies about your intent they could have you hospitalised but what does that have to do with whether a therapist is likely to hospitalise someone for expressing a desire to self harm or for withholding the answer to a question about suicidal intent? 

In the vast majority of cases, you will not be hospitalised unless you say you intend to act on a plan to kill yourself. Often, even if you say that you will be dismissed and ignored, because mental health treatment is pretty hard to come by in most places. That is especially the case at the moment. I'm not trying to trick anyone into disclosing something, I'm saying bar some very unusual circumstances disclosing anything other than explicit intent to act is extremely unlikely to get you hospitalised.

Someone lying about whether you have intent in order to maliciously have you hospitalised is an extreme edge case and frankly I don't think it's a helpful contribution to someone asking for generwl advice. Unless this person believes they have good reason to suspect their therapist is interested in having them forcibly hospitalised against their will, this isn't relevant and is just a way to scare them and discourage them from trusting their therapist.

TalkTherapy,fmzietk,t3_fy7e46,1586521370.0,"Sending your therapist a link to this post seems like a really odd way to communicate this. It comes across as aggressive to me. Like you're saying 'look all these people online are talking about you and they all agree you're bad'. 

It's one thing to share what you'd written or to use the suggestions people gave you for phrasing how you felt about what she did, but I think sharing a link is really a step beyond that."
TalkTherapy,fmz18rq,t1_fmyk7bt,1586502615.0,"I wrote this last night and I remembered when I woke up that I did actually discuss this with my therapist at one point. I have asked him for reassurance in the past, though now I can't remember about what, and he said that he doesn't think it would be helpful to me to provide that. 

I actually do see his point. I would love to hear positive things from my therapist, but I'm not sure if it would actually help me long term. I know there are at least some people who like me, and who have told me so many times, but knowing that doesn't help me at all. I doubt hearing it from my therapist would be the thing that changed how I feel about myself.

I also think it would be easy to kind of outsource your self esteem to a therapist who is very forthcoming with positive comments. Like maybe it would feel good to hear that but are you then basing your positive feeling about yourself around hearing certain things from someone else? Isn't the idea to learn to feel ok regardless of approval from others? I used to base my entire self worth around hearing positive feedback from teachers. That worked fine until I stopped getting that feedback because I wasn't at school anymore.

I don't know, maybe I'm just trying to make myself feel better and it's all just because my therapist can't stand me, but I also think there really are therapists who just don't work like this."

TalkTherapy,fmw3yr3,t1_fmvzd2m,1586438985.0,"Yeah I understand your worry about being discouraging. From my perspective I'm aiming my comment at the clinician. Maybe academically this therapist knows other therapists can be bad, but hearing a clinician make blanket assertions like this therapist is doing feels very invalidating to me as a service user who has had maybe 2 out of 12 therapists who were actually interested in analysing the therapeutic relationship and who could take criticism. 

I think if someone is on this sub they have plenty of exposure to posts telling them to share whatever they're feeling with their therapist. This sub tends to offer advice on the presumption that a given person's therapist is going to be open to talking about transference, and there are many positive posts about people who have been able to share things like that with their therapists. That perspective is not lacking. I think it has a tendency to swing very far to extremes, though, as anywhere online does. I think this post is at one of those extremes and at least for me personally doesn't represent most of my experiences with mental health care."

TalkTherapy,fmvapps,t3_fx6r4h,1586410805.0,"This is nice but you are speaking as if all therapists would respond as you have been trained to. Many of us have seen multiple therapists throughout our lives. It is simply not true that all therapists will be accepting of a client raising angry or erotic or critical feelings towards a therapist. A good therapist might be fine with that, but there are plenty of shit therapists out there.

In particular, people who have been in therapy long-term and who have longstanding and/or severe mental health issues, and/or who are anything other than successful middle class white people are often seen as difficult and purposefully resistant. When a patient like that suggests to a mental health practitioner that they are not feeling benefit from how they are being treated, or raises any criticism of the people treating them, it is very often taken to be just more evidence that that person is not trying and is being difficult and resistant.

People will generally tolerate me now that I am in full time employment in a well respected (albeit bullshit) career, but the shit I got when I sought help as a student was ridiculous. I got open contempt from people who were supposed to be helping me; doctors angrily asking me 'well what do you want from us' if I wasn't able to tell them exactly what treatment path I should be put on; therapists telling me I was difficult and overly aggressive because I complained when they told me it was ok for me, as someone who had previously been hospitalised for anorexia, to be eating only 1000 calories a day (that woman is a lecturer in psychotherapy lol! She says she's a specialist in eating disorders! She's written books!). 

The sentiment behind your post is nice but it's frustrating as someone who has been in the system for 16 years to hear people speak as if all therapists are good therapists."
relationships,fmoebrs,t3_fwd6h0,1586255882.0,"Can you approach this very seriously with concern for just how unable she is to accept feedback? Maybe she'd just find that extra patronising and frustrating but I'd want to try to understand why this is so impossible for her to accept. 

I'd start by gently pointing out that she must know this on some level because even she leaves her food to go rotten if given the choice (but I'd try really hard to avoid saying that it's because your food is better, try as hard as possible not to make it into a competition). I'd try to approach it with curiosity because I'm genuinely fascinated by how weird her response is and I would guess it's extremely emotional and painful for her on some level.

Reminds me of how my mum will reflexively tell me I don't have anxiety around money. It's too painful for her to accept she passed on a massive neurosis to me and my sister so she just tells me flat out I'm lying about how I feel. I have just accepted it since there's little to be gained from pressing it but that's because I don't live with her anymore. 

If it were my partner I'd try to approach it from a position of concern, curiosity, and understanding for how painful it must be for her to hear. That's hard because in this case your wife is being unreasonable so that might not feel fair. In a way you don't owe her sympathy. But it's about whether you want to resolve it constructively. I don't think there's a way to do that other than very gently, accounting for how painful the topic must be for her."

TalkTherapy,fmnxziw,t1_fmmpfoa,1586238667.0,"Yeah I've never had s therapist who was particularly conversational.

Maybe it's not and they just think I'm incredibly selfish in conversation and that's why they find me so off putting.

I mean I've been asking the same questions for 16 years. I think it's more that you have no choice but to think about those questions constantly when you don't want to be alive. I just don't want to be alive. Honestly it's quite painful to have that framed as me staring down the big questions rather than being in pain. Is that how everyone feels and I'm just uniquely bad at dealing with it? Is this actually the most I can ever expect from life?"
TalkTherapy,fmkgjli,t1_fmi7cai,1586154204.0,"I have actually tried an existential therapist, but he was completely thrown by me saying I didn't like it when therapists just repeat back what I've just said. He started obviously fumbling for anything else to do and it was hard to see him as competent given how completely stuck he got without that tool. He'd been recommended to me by someone who used to manage me at work and is an old friend of my partner, so it was really disappointing. I had 5/6 sessions with him so I felt like I gave it a fair shot. 

I have been thinking about trying to get involved in a church. I used to play the church organ at school and was sacristan for the school chapel. But I just like the aesthetics and the textual analysis in a very academic way. I'm not even slightly religious or spiritual. I would love to play the organ again though. I play other instruments but nothing else is quite like playing a real organ in a church where it fills the whole space. And I guess I do yoga but again there's nothing spiritual about it for me beyond mindfulness.

If it's about having a cause,I was very involved in a local political group until the end of last year when it just felt hopeless, and I got some meaning from that, but it was still something that was primarily stressful and guilt inducing rather than something I enjoyed. 

I feel like I have invested so much effort into the sorts of things that are supposed to help you stop being depressed and the sorts of things that I do enjoy in a very mild way. It's not like I just stay in bed and complain I have no motivation. But I've been pushing myself to do things for so many years without it ever reaching a point where on balance I'd rather be alive than dead. I might enjoy something, but it's usually associated with so much guilt and shame and stress and obligation that it's far more painful than it is enjoyable. I think maybe I am just not someone who can engage with other people. Maybe if I were totally alone the obligation and shame and stress wouldn't outweigh the enjoyment so completely. I don't know."
TalkTherapy,fmhbm70,t1_fmgeal7,1586073597.0,"Thanks :-) That makes sense.

I actually don't have goals with my current therapist. He said it might be useful for therapy to be a place where I don't have goals (my life has been very goal oriented, to my detriment I think). Someone told me once before that that was unethical but that sounded a bit dramatic to me. I felt like it made sense in context, but it does mean I can't assess whether therapy is helping me achieve my goals since I didn't have explicit ones. Maybe that's bad, idk.

My therapist now is psychodynamic, but I guess I'm wrong to say I've never had therapists who did more than repeat things. I have had a few sessions with other types of therapists and done group work in hospital (I was hospitalised for anorexia when I was younger). 

The experience I had with CBT felt even worse. I'd rather my therapist just repeat things than do that while explaining to me that I'm thinking wrong. My problem was never that I didn't recognise the irrationality of my thoughts, it was that I couldn't not think them. CBT therapists just seemed stumped that someone wasn't cured by being told they were being irrational. Like I was being defiant for still having negative thoughts even though they'd explained to me I shouldn't do that. I already argue with myself in my head about why what I'm thinking is wrong, but that doesn't change the feeling.

When we had DBT it just felt like people accepting I'd never not want to self harm. I didn't want to ping a rubber band on my wrist instead of burning myself with lighters; I wanted to not *want* to burn myself. But maybe that's hoping for too much. I've definitely had times where this urge has been much less, though, so I don't feel like it's an unreasonable goal.

I've done the goal setting types of therapy but those were explicitly about changing behaviour, not how we felt. It works if getting you to do things ends up making you feel better, but in my case I do and did things all the time: I exercise, I have hobbies, I work, I see people, but they aren't at all pleasurable, or at least not enough to make life seem worth living when balanced with how hard everything is. The whole idea behind behavioural activation seems to be that once you get people to do things, the motivation will come back and they'll feel good again. There's not much to do if someone does things but just feels awful doing them, and in hospital they openly admitted they only cared about us doing the behaviours, not whether the behaviours made us less depressed. If we went back to work/school, they had succeeded, even if we still thought about suicide constantly. 

I'm worried I was just born without the apparatus to feel happy. I have been depressed since I was very young, and developed self harm and anorexia as I got older, though I'm better about not doing those things now. I wonder if maybe it's just wrong to expect life not to feel like constantly running up a hill when you're completely out of energy. I don't know how other people do it. It's like I just totally lack whatever it is that makes things rewarding for people. Or maybe they all feel like this but just whine about it less. I just feel like I'm constantly running on empty and nothing recharges me. If you asked me to relive any given period of my life, I wouldn't want to, not even the best times. But what can a therapist say to that?"
TalkTherapy,fmfbyil,t3_futko4,1586024059.0,"I'd ask you why the distinction is important to you? Are you worried you won't be taken seriously if you ask for help? Are you worried about being stigmatised if you do have a disorder? Are you thinking that the problems you have aren't serious enough to be a disorder and therefore don't matter? 

If something is impacting your life and causing you not to be able to eat in a way that's healthy for you, it's serious and it matters. You matter, regardless of whether your eating is disordered or a disorder or both or neither. If something is distressing you that matters."
TalkTherapy,fmf5g1h,t1_fmeusm2,1586020309.0,"In a way, but in that case I'm still a bit lost on what the difference is. What does responding strategically look like? In my therapist's case it seems to just be barely responding at all except to say hmm.  It's not strategic in the sense of giving advice, so is it just not saying particularly damaging things? Like avoiding saying stuff that's actively invalidating?

I feel like I've never had a therapist who did anything beyond repeat stuff back to me. The only difference has been in how articulate they were. Some struggled to rephrase things in a way that wasn't stilted and blatant repetition ('I sense you're feeling [literally exactly what I just said]'), while others were articulate enough to replay back what I said but with a nicer and more natural spin, so it was less obvious that they were replaying it. I have had therapists completely clam up when I've told them I don't like it when they repeat stuff back to me. Just visibly fumble attempting to do something else because that was very clearly the basis of their work, and they were lost when I asked them not to do it.

Sorry I realise I just sound like I'm arguing with you and obviously you're not obliged to reply. I appreciate the replies you've made. I'm just really sad that I feel like I have to figure everything out on my own. I never expected my therapist to be able to help me, but I did hope he could, at least a bit, if that makes sense."
TalkTherapy,fme64hl,t1_fmdjo9o,1585990948.0,"This sort of makes sense to me, but I feel like if that worked it ought to work when you find it in non therapy relationships where there is reciprocity, too. Why doesn't non judgemental love from friends or partners fix things?

If I can't really *feel* the real and reciprocated love I get from people in my life, in that it doesn't help me not to hate myself, what good is having someone provide that in therapy going to do (or in the case of my therapist, fail to mimic that)? I feel like surely this only works if your problem is that you've never had that from anyone else in your life. What if your problem is that people say they like and love you, but you still hate yourself and can't feel connected to anyone? Even if my therapist genuinely liked me I think it wouldn't help, and as it happens, he doesn't, so it's even worse."

To not just be on my own trying to figure out how not to be miserable.

It's scary to think there just isn't any guidance out there. People say to get therapy if you're depressed or have other mental health issues, but if sharing how you feel with someone doesn't fix you, what are you supposed to do then? That's really all the help we have available? I'm really hoping there's more to it, and I just don't know how to access it..."

I understand it's not give advice. But if it's just to reflect back what the client has just said or to say things like 'I sense that's very painful' etc., couldn't we just perform therapy on ourselves?

I've had the exact thought OP has. Why cant I just so this to myself at home and save the money? I don't think I lack basic insight, so it's not like my therapist ever has any insight beyond what I present to him. I read a lot about what therapists don't do, and how the client needs to do the work themselves... but surely there's *something* the therapist is supposed to be doing that couldn't be done by just any person off the street, right?

I'm not trying to be combative, I am just really struggling to understand what it's ok for clients to expect out of therapy, if anything. It's what we're 'supposed' to do if we're struggling, at least according to a lot of people on the internet, but I'm not really sure why, at the moment."

Incredibly entitled. If you cant speak to women without calling them cunts, you need to inform them of that beforehand and possibly ask to speak to a male instead.

I think the main issue I'm having is I don't feel at all grateful to him. I'm extremely angry with him. He took my money but clearly didnt even bother to think about how he felt in sessions with me for even 5 minutes after each session. Sometimes he forgets to bill me. He had to physically drag his eyes open in e very session for over three months and only admitted it was happening after I brought it up (and even then, at first he just tried to turn it into a discussion about how it must mean I usually worry that other people are falling asleep, when actually that is unique to him, and is due to the fact that he.... was obviously falling asleep).

I want to just ghost but hate feeling this angry about it all the time. Yet the more we discuss it the angrier I get because the more we discuss it the more he tries to act like this must be indicative of some wider issue and not just that I'm angry at him for taking 75 quid an hour to take a fucking nap.

askatherapist,fljgfcm,t3_fnsqlk,1585211452.0,"There's nothing wrong with being into cross-dressing. It's very common and can be fun for partners, too. My ex was a cross-dresser and we had a lot of fun with it, though we had other issues. I think a lot of the shame around it is based in misogyny (on society's part not necessarily yours specifically). It's like a character says in the Cement Garden (which I think Madonna quoted at some point):

“Girls can wear jeans and cut their hair short and wear shirts and boots because it's okay to be a boy; for girls it's like promotion. But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading, according to you, because secretly you believe that being a girl is degrading.”

That said, I think you should be more concerned about this:

\> I feel almost helpless to my desire to crossdress and be feminine.

Even with chemical addictions, at some point you have to take ownership of the choices you are making. You are making a decision, every time you do this, to be dishonest with the partner you are supposed to love. You are not only hiding a huge part of yourself, you are doing something you know they would consider to be crossing a line. You are choosing to do that. Don't pretend this is some external force that comes over you. That's just an attempt to absolve yourself of your responsibility in your relationship.

People often use this 'I was so stressed!' line to justify cheating (and I think this is a mild form of that). I feel like you're hinting at the same here by mentioning how this is a response to stress, though maybe that's unfair. But there are other ways to deal with stress. Don't let yourself pretend to yourself that this is all out of your control and just an unhealthy coping mechanism you can't help.

Why do you feel this is something you can't share with your partner? What was the worry at the start that stopped you sharing it with her? I can see why now you might feel it's too far in (though I still think you have a responsibility to tell her if you want to have a real relationship with her), but what was the concern at the start?

In my case he is a lot more responsive to transference discussions, to the point sometimes I want to say 'it feels like you only care about my therapy when we're talking about how I feel about you', which I might say next time actually. But then we go back to talking about something else having discussed how the silent responses make me feel and he either just says nothing, or like yours will just say he doesn't know what to say.

It is really, really sad to realise this, but at least it has made me realise I want to stop with my therapist and stop wasting my time with him. I understand not wanting to open up the possibility of having to deal with that reaction when you are already in a bad place, and the worry about ending up being too harsh ( I have been very harsh, which to his credit he has taken, but I don't know how another therapist would react). It's hard over video, too. That sounds like really rough timing all round, sorry you're going through that!"
TalkTherapy,flj27x1,t1_flhxe4s,1585196743.0,"Well I think the reason people focused on discussing what your therapist may feel about you is because from reading your initial post and some of the comments, it feels like your current emotional response is premised on the assumption that your therapist does want to have sex with you, or at least has romantic feelings for you. So if people feel like you're unlikely to be right about that, it's very relevant to how you should manage your emotions, because managing your emotions is going to look very different depending on what her response is.

Given that in almost 100% of cases where someone has similar feelings on this sub, the therapist is not going to reciprocate, it would be inappropriate and I think quite cruel to help people emotionally prep for an expected reciprocation. You may be one of the tiny % of cases where your therapist feels the same way you do and is willing to act on it, but we on this sub are obviously going to lean towards thinking you're one of the 99% of cases where your therapist will maintain professional boundaries and not reciprocate."

askatherapist,flhk9lj,t1_flhh80x,1585164261.0,"I'm really glad it has been helpful for you!

That exactly how I have felt in the past about my therapist, but more recently, since I challenged him about his obviously struggling to stay awake in sessions, I've pushed him on how i haven't made progress and how I feel he spent many sessions just saying nothing but 'hmm' back to me, and how his interpretations just seem like random attempts to draw a link between disparate things I've said. It took me being very hurt for me to get angry enough to be open about those things.

In my case, I haven't been satisfied by his responses at all. I don't feel he can explain how what he's doing is supposed to help beyond vague statements about resolving and repairing wounds (ok but how?) and I don't feel like he is open to the possibility that my being angry at him struggling to stay awake in every session over >3 months is mostly just legitimate anger at paying £75 an hour for him to zone out, not mostly transference. 

It's just made me very sad because now I have no real hope of things working out with him.

That said, I would still really recommend saying those challenging things. You can ask questions and discuss what you feel is your lack of progress without being directly critical, I think, and a good therapist should be able to deal with a client leveling some criticism at them, as long as it's not just you being hostile to them every session. It sounds like you have reasonable concerns that would be  valid to bring up. Either it will help you have a more productive and honest relationship with them, or you'll realise that isn't a possibility and go from there. Either way I think it's better than carrying on but feeling it's not really getting you anywhere.

Not trying to push you in any direction obviously, that's just my personal take on it."
