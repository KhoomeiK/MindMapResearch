Well, I do think I could have given more context to the situation but I think the diminished 'wholesomeness' comes from a few things.  

First, they aren't strangers. I'm not sure how familiar you are with the world of e-sports at the streamer/semi-pro and professional level, especially as one narrows to a specific game? But everyone knows everyone either directly or by word of mouth. These people have definitely interacted before. The two women in question are well known e-girls.

To be fair to you, some of the comments can definitely come off as crude. However, and I say this as a liberal, gay, feminist-female? This is kind of the standard language of the world. It'd be much more expected to compliment someone on their 24 inch biceps or their massive schlong than their biting wit. I mean, as you can see from a fellow e-sports enthusiast that also commented in this post, the man getting all the support is mostly known for his giant forehead. It's all in good fun.

I also don't think I caught both but the girls do react positively. It's just memeing. No one is taking it truly seriously and I sincerely doubt anyone's uncomfortable. Especially given the public 'personas' of the people involved and how harshly the league comes down on people that behave inappropriately. The fines just aren't worth it. 

By definition, being a wingman involves a degree of distracting the 'non-target' and hyping up the person you're wing-manning so I think the comments are par for the course. I consider myself pretty culturally sensitive and didn't really take offense to anything that was said. Just seems like a mix of cultural and age differences with a bit of confusion about their relationship/lack-thereof. I hope that helped ease your mind a little bit, though!"

&#x200B;

I game A LOT. An ACTUAL lot. And on a fair number of different games, most of them with active competitive leagues. I'm chummy with people that are a even more involved in gaming than I am. From what I've seen, there are a few standard ways women cope with this.

&#x200B;

1. Never use a mic

2. Be one of the boys

3. Have a group of people you play with

3. Be ""the bitch"" 

4. Just ignore them.

longbeach,fpsml4d,t1_fprnbwl,1588876017.0,"With all due respect, how closely have you been following this thing? I have many friends in Taiwan, Japan and South Korea. My family does business with Hubei. I've been following the news since December. When I realized it was getting worse in the US, back in February, I hunkered down. I have literally only left the house once since the and it was for a cleaning products run.

I interact with postmates/doordash/grubhub/Amazon Prime/Amazon Fresh/Shipt etc regularly. 

I interact with UPS/FedEx/USPS Daily.

I have housemates that, while they engage in social distancing and do not go out unnecessarily? Are still exposed to other people and are in high risk categories themselves. They don't have the s ame luxury that I do, staying home. They have to be the ones in charge of grocery shopping. They have to pick up their medicines. 

I've been told to have my family take off their shoes before coming home, preferably in a garage (which we don't have) but if all else fails at the front door or in sunlight. They have to wash their clothes and take showers first thing. We can't share dishes. My family is from a culture that does cheek kisses as greetings and partings. Haven't been able to in weeks. I have to wash our produce, wipe down hard surface foods like cans, transfer boxed food to other containers. 

These actions aren't some sort of obsessive need for cleanliness. Sure, I like a pair of fresh sheets. But my laundry is all over the place because I keep putting it on my bed to make myself fold it and then, as is tradition, shove it all onto my chair because I'm too tired. I don't like having to do all these things and i'm not supposed to be the one doing them. But we don't have any other choice. And it would be a lot less of a problem if it wasn't for the fact that I CAN'T rely on other people to maintain a bare minimum, and honestly? It's a minimum amount of effort not to go out in large groups for unnecessary reasons. It's not hard. It just isn't. 

While those around me do everything they can, they cannot control whether or not someone decided to hang out with beachgoers or flout the law by going to one of the businesses that have been operating despite the law. 

Other people have it far, far worse than I do. They must expose themselves and they're relying on the decency of other people.

As I told someone above: I'm not against the re-opening or against people going out. I'm just as happy as everyone else that they get to go out. But California is not re-opening all willy nilly. They're taking precautions. It's very different from these stupid mass gatherings where people don't even observe social distancing. I'm against the idea that going out to see the bioluminescence as some form of stupid protest. I'm against the ACTUAL protests. 

Because no matter how many precautions I take? If people refuse to take some themselves? It's only a matter of time. 

Honestly? I don't think the public at large are TRULY grasping how dangerous this virus is. Maybe it's because they haven't seen the effect it has on people they love. I have. The number of individuals in asia whom I know, who are grieving the losses of children, parents, grandparents? Watching my friend slowly die via TikToks without being able to SEE her family again? That was difficult. We didn't even get to see that much, at the end of it all. Watching people HERE IN THE STATES, that I love, getting sick? It's HARD. And then, after seeing that - I see morons with more guns than brain cells calling the virus fake news. I see my fellow Californians flouting the restrictions because they're tired of being home. I see people saying ""it's not my responsibility."" As if essentially writing off the lives of other people is ""worth it."" 

It's not like they have been ACTUALLY forced to stay cooped up or forgo their starbucks runs and takeout. And it's not like they won't be able to go to restaurants now and engage in other behavior. But it's about the irresponsibility of gatherings like the one that this post talks about. 

The news tells them that a vaccine maybe coming soon and it gives them a false sense of security. The countries that handled this well are the ones that took it seriously from the beginning. Meanwhile we skyrocketed to the most cases in the course of a few weeks. 

So yes, ideally i'd like there to be tickets and fines. Preferably increasing of increasing quantities and severity as repeated offenses happening. Maybe jail time for those running around intentionally coughing at grocery stores, spitting in people's food or spitting on the ground. I don't think that's too much to ask."

I'm lucky. I'm not having issues with staying at home. I always worked from home. But that doesn't mean that my interactions with people that I meet are safe in any way shape or form. It doesn't prevent the people around me from being sick. It doesn't prevent other vulnerable people who ARE having to go out from getting sick. 

You cannot POSSIBLY compare diseases that only affect or are dangerous to the individual with one that could literally kill other people. I'm sorry, you jus can't. This isn't about people taking personal responsibility for their health it's about them consciously and willfully making choices that endanger others. 

I cannot believe that you're shrugging off other people's lives and essentially saying, ""not my problem."" I honestly think it's nice that the person in the article thinks she's taking the high road.

news,flhx5ux,t3_fov8od,1585171164.0,"I really struggle with this issue.

I'm 100% pro-trans-rights, extremely liberal and a member of the LGBT community. Yet, i take issue with the idea of trans-women qualifying for cis-female sporting events. I can't find a justifiable reason in favor of it, aside from the implication that trans-women aren't women. Even after years of hormone therapy, trans women do have physical advantages (greater lung capacity, for example) over cis-women. In the same way that we separate many events by weight class, I do think that trans women should have a separate class in sporting events.  I know that sounds horrible but I just can't think of any viable workaround."

TrueOffMyChest,flhqirz,t1_flhqavm,1585167622.0,"I mean that's kind of the point too. Young voters come off as extremely entitled. If they don't get their ideal candidate, they give up and don't vote. They become disillusioned without actually having put up a fight. Nudge the needle to the left bit by bit. It's better than letting it tick its way right because you didn't."
TrueOffMyChest,flhqdcf,t1_flhq4vr,1585167544.0,"Because younger people (i include millennials) are 'too busy working to follow the primary or vote.' 40-50 year olds are just as busy working, let's not pretend we have a real retirement age anymore. They still showed up."
TrueOffMyChest,flhq99u,t1_flhp9pq,1585167482.0,You realize that voter turnout is determined by holding the numbers of those who turned out versus those registered to vote...right? Literally that's...that's how it's calculated.
TrueOffMyChest,flhq4o6,t1_flhpoy4,1585167412.0,My point is that you're calling something apathy that isn't apathy?

TrueOffMyChest,flhp9qh,t1_flhoyvk,1585166932.0,That is very literally not what apathy is? You're thinking of inaction. One can be not-apathetic and still be inactive.
TrueOffMyChest,flhp4ax,t1_flhoumo,1585166850.0,"You realize that these percentages aren't against one another, right? It's percentage of older voters registered versus those who showed up. The number of young voters who showed up, relative to those who are registered was low. The number of older voters who should up, relative to those who were registered, was significantly higher. One being high doesn't make the other low by default?"
TrueOffMyChest,flhosw7,t1_flhob87,1585166679.0,"With all due respect, one can easily choose not to register to vote. It's a pretty safe assumption that those that do have SOME political leanings or concerns. It's pretty easy to avoid registering. And again, we're talking about YOUNG VOTERS.

TrueOffMyChest,flhlrrp,t1_flhl1v4,1585165080.0,"Agree to disagree on that. And I'd love to see any numbers you have to back it up because I have plenty on my side:

https://www.hamilton.edu/news/polls/political-attitudes-of-young-americans

""In contrast to many suggestions that 18-24 year olds are alienated from politics, the survey shows most young people are involved in and aware of politics. For example, 88.1 percent of those surveyed said that they were registered to vote and 76.9 percent said that they were likely to vote in national elections. 61.7 percent said that they followed political news some of the time and 29.4 percent said that they followed it all of the time.""

TrueOffMyChest,flhl7q1,t1_flhi5wu,1585164775.0,"I mean i'm sorry but that's just untrue. Polling numbers and the actual turnout simply don't line up. Again, that's a fact. You can't dispute numbers, my dude."
TrueOffMyChest,flhkyer,t1_flhh2o4,1585164634.0,"You seem to not realize that social media is exceptionally prevalent among young voters and does serve as at least a partial gauge of where their political support (those that are politically active) goes. Representative samples in research are used in numbers far smaller than those of people active on social media. Besides, the point WAS specifically about those ON social media."
TrueOffMyChest,flhkpkd,t1_flhikg1,1585164501.0,Young voter turnout has ALWAYS been proportionally less.
TrueOffMyChest,flhkogz,t1_flhj3td,1585164485.0,"Young voters, as a whole, are hardly ""the group most effected"" by voter suppression. Add a for other factors in there and sure, some of them are AMONG the most suppressed group. But as a category in and of themselves they're definitely not."

TrueOffMyChest,flhg2wo,t1_flhfftz,1585161966.0,I mean reddit is most definitely not my entire barometer. Even if it was? You seem to have convinced yourself that your high school class is a more representative sample of social media than a social media website with millions of users.

You‚Äôre also ignoring that this is about the fact that the NUMBER of older voters who turned out, relative to those of them registered to vote, was significantly higher. That‚Äôs my point. We could EASILY offset them if we actually turned out more than they did. We don‚Äôt."
TrueOffMyChest,flhfb34,t1_flhdo0y,1585161568.0,We‚Äôre not talking about the perspective of people disposed to vote for Biden. We are talking about the low turnout among young Bernie supporters.
TrueOffMyChest,flhf6e9,t1_flhbzsb,1585161501.0,"Biden was exceptionally clear about his policies in debates. Even the media made his platforms clear. Honestly, I can‚Äôt agree with what you‚Äôre saying. Biden was presented as the most electable but it was specifically because his policies are so moderate.

TrueOffMyChest,flherqo,t1_flhbwm0,1585161290.0,"I think the point IS that so many of them care enough to tweet, but not enough to educate themselves or turn out. It‚Äôs hypocritical.

They have no easier of a time getting to the polls than students do."
TrueOffMyChest,flhejb5,t1_flhcnzt,1585161169.0,"By this logic, though I have several disagreements with you, doesn‚Äôt that mean the hardcore Bernie supporters could have done this?

TrueOffMyChest,flhebdb,t1_flhczrp,1585161054.0,"‚ÄúHigh‚Äù is a relative term here meaning, more than the absolutely abysmal low of previous years. That does not make it ‚Äúhigh‚Äù compared to the other demographics and certainly not high as a whole."
