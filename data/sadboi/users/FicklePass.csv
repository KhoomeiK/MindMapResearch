Movies you have to squeeze so much more into since they’re so much shorter compared to tv shows. Captain marvel had around 2 hours of run time whereas avatar got that in 4 episodes (6 if you take out commercials for a 20 min start to end episode) so the longer time of avatar leads to even more emotional investment. I can’t speak a ton on captain marvel since I haven’t seen it but if it was like the northern water tribe arc for the whole movie then yeah I can see why some would label it as propaganda.

Emotional work just isn’t work. It’s helpful like how you can go to the employee who always comes through, but it doesn’t count. You clearly value the personality of A over B and that’s the one reason he gets more. Let me give you a glimpse of the future.

Here’s how twins work from my experience. Attached at the hip or not at all. I’m not fond of my twin (long story) but it’s got nothing to do with my parents showing favoritism. I can tell you you’re gonna get resentment directed at the favorite twin even when it should be directed at you. So if you want your kids to not talk in the future, keep it up!

AskFeminists,fmvb58u,t1_fmv0j9x,1586411173.0,"True but it’s also set in what’s technically a medieval time so to speak, and their were misogynistic views back then. It’s also true that was a “yeah fight the patriarchy!” Arc, but it was set up perfectly! As I said we saw katara struggle through the whole season. The whole seasons end game was finding a water bending master. Once we were at that goal and this character we loved couldn’t do it simply cause she was a girl we were outraged, we were upset, we WANTED to fight the patriarchy. That’s one of the reasons it worked cause we saw the struggle leading up to it. And once they proved katara was bad ass, the show just let her continue to be bad ass because she was bad ass, not cause of the sole reason she was a girl. So yeah one part of the show was pretty heavy handed, but if someone can’t handle a good plot device that works regardless of message they can fuck right off."

The only character that really exhibits I’m good because I’m just good is azula, and that’s to establish her as a foil to zuko. As for and being overly feminist that’s not the vibe I got. I believe what they were going for was childish, which I feel you can see him mature as the series progresses.

Check out [these bad boys](https://www.netgear.com/home/products/networking/powerline/PL1200.aspx). This converts the electrical wiring in your house into your own personal Ethernet cord. Simply plug one in near your router, plug an Ethernet cord into it like you would a normal device, then place the other one near your Xbox. Grab another Ethernet cord and plug that in and you’re done! Technically it’s not quite as good as being plugged straight into the router, but it’s basically the same thing. I use it for my computer gaming. 

Now a couple things to note, if the house is old, might not get the best signal. Additionally, these have to be plugged in directly to the wall. Plugging them into extender or surge protectors cause signal degradation and will cause a bad time. Other than that they are pretty simple to use! I highly recommend them as they are much better than snaking an Ethernet cord throughout the house."

Challenging the accepted is what leads to new results, which is why I find it respectable. I just wish it went to challenging something a little less obvious."

If you are being asked in the way you are saying (where are you REALLY from) that’s a dumb question cause you told them you are from New York.

Personally I think as long as your respectful about it asking about ancestry is not a big deal. It’s not an ice breaker topic, but if you know the person why not?"
