I am going to assume you are familiar with Python. You will want the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), found here - [https://www.nltk.org/](https://www.nltk.org/)

You can also download some text corpora, the instructions are here - [https://www.nltk.org/book/ch02.html](https://www.nltk.org/book/ch02.html)

I would run through the tutorials here to gain a good base level of understanding - [https://www.guru99.com/nltk-tutorial.html](https://www.guru99.com/nltk-tutorial.html)

The above tutorial does tell you how to download the nltk and corpora however it's always good to have the primary sources for reference.

From a glance at the tutorial I would personally advise you to work up to - ""Counting POS Tags, Frequency Distribution & Collocations in NLTK"". You might find the last two topics complicated and require some more base knowledge in mathematics and ML.

Your hips are slightly shooting up out of the bottom of the squat. This is becase your back is wanting to take over the lift becase it is strong.

Deep ward when you see the opportunity to ward the enemy jungle e.g. if their jungle shows top. 

Buy pinks. Pinks > item completion (in most cases). Buy two pinks, use one aggressively in the lane to gain control. Then use the second as a defensive pink if they take the first.

formcheck,f2e6hv3,t3_dd33nu,1570183571.0,"hi there,

I can see the makings of a beast before me!

from what I see with your squat is that your lower back is taking over a lot of the work. Obviously we would prefer if the quads were doing more of the lifting. This might actually make you have to lift a bit lighter to begin with, but since the quads are better suited to lift the weight in a squat, in the long term you will be able to lift way more!

At the lowest point in your squat, look at where you knees end up. You want to keep your knees in that forward position for as long as possibe. Imagine they hit an imaginary wall. Once your knees touch that wall, keep them touched against that wall for as long as possible. This will active your quads way more in the squat. 

You've got a strong back which is great because now you can use the power in your back to really explode and push the weight up once out of the hole. You'll also be able to squat to depth more often (just like your first rep), because your lower back is fatiguing fast, your quads wont fatigue as fast.

Please watch the 5 pillars of squatting on youtube, in particular i think you'd benefit from episode 4 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVr8O7b3AHA&t=147s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVr8O7b3AHA&t=147s)

I am currently playing again [https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=theburningbrit](https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=theburningbrit) just got into plat 4.

I will pretty much always rush mobis depending on how the game is going, even before completing my the first upgrade of my supp item (I do this if early snowball). However, this is because I roam and place deep pink wards early game. I believe I am getting away with this kind of play style at the moment because of the low rank. 

Honestly, it is all situational. I like to build boots of swiftness or the tenacity boots on Soraka. For example, if I was a soraka vs leona I would 100% build tenacity boots.

I would probably always build mobis on morgana due to her shield. Same in regard to Alistar due to the roaming potential.

You should play around and really try understand what tools the enemy team have, and what tools you have to decide what boots to build.

The best thing about support is how much artistic control we have over the game, and how persistent good plays from us can lead to team wins."

gzcl,ew2f432,t3_cmfr82,1565045140.0,"Hi there,

I'll try answer a few things for and let you know what has worked for me (some of our goals are similar).

I've completely replaced lat pull downs with pull ups and chin ups. I tend to superset this with leg work. Right now I can do a max set of around 8 or 9. So I tend to superset doing 4 reps at a time. One tip, keep your form super strict! Full extensions of the arms at the bottom. This fits in with your general fitness goals. Personally I'm not a fan of press ups and crunches. 

 Now, I tend to do T3 work in direct assistance of the T1 lift that day (and any extra T2s). For example:

T1: Squat - 68kg 4x4+ REACH DEPTH

T2a: Leg Press - 155kg 3x8

T2b: Bench Press - 55kg 3x10 super

T3: Bulgarian Split Squat - 20kg 3x12

T3: Pull Up - bodyweight 8x4+ super...

T3: Face pull 11.25kg 3x15

However it's kind of up to you. My heavy deadlift day was today and I throw in some light leg extensions to get my quads ready for my heavy squat day (as above). 

I don't actually do direct ab work. I've really focused on bracing hard. Squeezing my abs when doing compounds and other exercises (pull ups work your abs quite well). From what I've seen from the online communities is that crunches/sit ups aren't the greatest for abs! People rave a lot about hanging leg raises. You could do some direct ab work on your cardio day? Just as a 10-15 minute warm up perhaps. There's lots of great 15mim ab workouts on YouTube. Though I would keep all the weightlifting to the 4 days.

I can see I have a problem with my knees getting in the way when dropping the weight. I also don't feel I'm hinging correctly. I don't really feel deadlifts in my hamstrings, but more my lower back.

I also don't believe I'm creating enough tension in my lats. 

Please let me know what you think, cheers"

Fitness,erkhfd9,t3_c2f6r2,1560963531.0,"Alright so I've fully got my Karen on for this one. This happened Monday.

Get in the gym. It's quite busy. Set up a bar for me to deadlift. Guy on my right on the 45 degree leg press. Has 4 * 25kg plates each side + 2 * 20kg plates each side. Leaves with all his weights and walks off to the squat rack and sets up the bar. I can't be asked to say something, it's busy I can't be asked for this. I rerack all his weights whilst resting between my deadlift set. 

Bare in mind this guy is like 6ft5+. So he has the bar set up to squat now. He eventually works up to 100kg and does some shitty quarter rep bullshit set. Leaves the 2*20kg plates on each side... I've now set up a bar to do some OHP behind the squat rack after re-racking my deadlift plates. 

Guy wants to do some squats, and I say go ahead. I make a joke about how people leave the gym in a state like it's our job to clean up after them. He is a bit smaller than me and slightly struggles getting them down (since the guy was tall as fuck).

HE THEN PROCEEDS TO PUT THE 20KG PLATES BACK ONTO THE EMPTY LEG PRESS I HAD JUST TAKEN EVERYTHING OFF 🤦‍♂️

I was done. Fully done, I went onto the boxing bag after that. Don't even ask about the kid using the momentum of the boxing bag to make it swing loads when hitting it thinking he was hard as fuck. Mondays...."
gzcl,er18qlp,t3_c04g2v,1560428476.0,"Ellooo people, so I don't see so many vanilla GZCLP posts in these discussion threads (because of GG I guess)! So I figured I'd chime in how it's been going for me.

What a fantastic program. I've been going to the gym for about 9 months now. I started GZCLP at the turn of the new year. So it's been 6 months running GZCLP.

Starting stats (estimate) - 06/01/19:
SQUAT - 60KG, BENCH - 50KG
DEADLIFT - 80KG, OHP - 35KG

Progress stats:
SQUAT - 100KG, BENCH - 80KG 
DEADLIFT - 140KG OHP - 55KG

So I'm pretty fucking pleased! Deadlifting has come so naturally for me, I started really low and literally only restarted the weight about 4 weeks ago. I'm going to absolutely smash that 140kg, I reckon I can pull 160kg as a one rep max right now. But all good things come to those that wait right?

I did actually test for my squat one rep max (yesterday), I got to 100kg. Squatting for me has been such a progress over the 6 months wow. It just seems squatting is pretty difficult? I had to keep revisiting my form, homing it in. I'm so happy to have been able to hit three digits. I didn't think I could do it! Thought I was more like 95kg.

 I've obviously adapted the vanilla GZCLP to better meet my needs. Have added some extra T2's on some days and added 2-3 T3's to certain days. Just because I work 6 days a week so I have to plan when I can do more volume tactically! 

Anyway, just wanted to say thank you thank you for this amazing way of working out. Looking at JnT 2.0 next for more periodic style of training! Cheers"

Your post has actually made starting the GG system less daunting to me actually. I'm currently running GZCLP slightly adapted to my needs , and I can feel myself getting to a stage where I've out lived it.

I'll probs do JNT next myself!"

Fitness,eqs2oxd,t3_bzegkk,1560275356.0,"Hey man come join us over on r/GZCL you can find inspiration from other people's routine posts in there / make a post yourself asking for critique.

Don't over think it and just go in and do the vanilla version as it is. 

Accessories are just well... Accessories. It's that ""chasing the pump"" phase of your training session. Do the vanilla version for a week or two and then add in another T3 excersise based on what you want.

Triceps holding back your bench? Add some tricep pull downs as a T3. Weak core brace when squatting heavy? Add some hanging raises! 

This is what is great about GZCLP. It is so customisable to your needs."
gzcl,eqmyn99,t1_eqmpgd7,1560169402.0,"In regards to your extra T2 selections do you know they're a weak spot already? Seems you've got a lot of deadlift variation work! Obviously if you want to up your deadlift and you know your weak spots then keep it as is.

I tend to keep extra T2 work to directly work on the T1 of that day but that's just my preference. I'd find your first work out of T1 Squat, T2 Bench and T2 RDL too taxing personally. But if you feel you can do it, then why not! Everything else looks good mate. Perhaps some direct bicep work on one day?"

Squats have been a pain in my ass. I've had to restart the weight back to low a few times whilst drilling in my form, whereas deadlifts came so naturally to me. I can deadlift 140KG for 1 rep.
