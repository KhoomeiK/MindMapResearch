flightsim,fnyxbz8,t3_g485qr,1587379172.0,"If he's looking for combat sims I imagine DCS is the one to go with. There's a big community for it and highly detailed aircraft simulations. DCS system specs would give you an idea of what you'd need to run it. I run X-plane on an older i7 3770 and with some tweaking I get nice results. I have an older gpu (rx580 4gb) which seems to run most things fine. Although I haven't run DCS. I think if you could budget for a newer graphics card that would be maybe the most critical component. RAM at least 16gb. It all depends on your budget. If you can build your own machine that is ultimately the best option to get the most value.

As for controllers you can get away with any joystick. But something like saitek HOTAS with rudder pedals or yoke is a great option. There is also the honeycomb yoke and throttle quadrant coming soon. But again it depends on what style of flying your dad wants to do. Finding used controllers in your local city/town is always a great option to save cash."

flightsim,fnceskw,t3_g0xxhd,1586835004.0,Heads up to the folks who are having texture issues with their aircraft. It may be worth while checking to see if the livery you're using is in PNG or DDS format. I couldn't load the Caravan without my card running out of VRAM in Beta 3. But after I converted the textures to DDS from PNG loading is no issue and the textures are super clean. It's related to the way Vulkan/Metal handles textures. Use XGrinder from LR to drag and drop your PNG textures and it will output DDS. Just leave your old textures in place in case something doesn't work for you.

Learning speeds and common configurations for takeoff and landing will help enormously. Landings are tricky. Some aircraft like the PC-12 is extremely forgiving and easy to land well. Others like the Q400 are notoriously difficult to consistently make nice landings. The C172 is a nice slow starter that will be just challenging enough to let you get your feet wet and figure things out.

When starting out turn off all weather. No surface winds at all. Then learn your speeds and power settings for consistent descents and a good nose up attitude on flare. You'll figure it out after doing circuits for a while.
