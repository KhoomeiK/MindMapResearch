I absolutely 100% agree. The decision was made too early, and now nothing can be done no matter what the situation is like. They should have put them on 'indefinite hold', meaning they'd either be postponed, or cancelled if the situation worsened to the point they wouldn't be possible. Of course, this brings its own issues, such as what happens with international A Levels, and what happens to students who have contracted the virus or need to self isolate due to symptoms/family members with symptoms.

>b) It would’ve been an easier task to push exams back a couple weeks than implement a whole new process for awarding grades.

Potentially. However, we don't know what goes on behind the scenes, or what other complications this could cause. I doubt two weeks would be enough of a push back to allow them to go ahead, but even if it was, this could cause issues with marking. I guess you could then say that you could push results day back to allow for this, but again this could have complications with re-marks etc. And the same issues as in a).

>c) That makes sense, but for exams, students would only have to be in for the ~2hr exam. With the primary schools going back, that’s a lot more kids, in school all day everyday. Significantly more contact hours.

Yeah, I can't really argue with this, because I don't think primary school children should be going in at all. Seems ridiculous to me.

>d) We would’ve have to teach ourselves the remaining elements of the course. At least we are in control of that, and our grades are down to us in that scenario.

Fair enough. This could cause issues related to resources (or lack thereof) provided by schools for self studying, as well as issues related to coursework. For example, some students may not have internet access or a PC where they need them, and instead were relying on school PCs for coursework. And they may not be able to access online resources at home. I know in this day and age it seems like everyone has reliable and constant access to the internet but it's not the case. Still, it is definitely a minority and I guess it shouldn't be the central concern in this.

>e) Sort of the same as c). I understand that socially distancing may prove difficult for exams, but surely schools could just split children into multiple classrooms across campus. I’m aware different centres have varying numbers of candidates, but my college for example has 1000 Y13 students and there would’ve been more than enough classrooms to accommodate social distancing practices during exams. If they’re allowing 4 cohorts of primary school students back, and claiming they will adhere to social distancing, I think it’s reasonable to suggest a bunch of 16/17/18 year old kids could do their exams, and they would be more mature and actually be able to distance more effectively. The gov. seems okay with allowing people to pile onto the tube to go to work but not for some kids to queue up to take their exam? Hmm.

First and foremost, splitting students over multiple rooms isn't a viable option due to the lack of staff. Exams require JCQ certified invigilators, of which most schools only have a handful, and certainly not enough to cover many different rooms. Even given these circumstances, the integrity of exams is extremely important, and if that can't reasonably be kept, I personally think it's better they aren't run at all.

Yes, I agree GCSE and A Level students are more likely to be able to socially distance than young kids who are going back to school. Again, I can't say anything here because I don't think they should be going back at all.

>The gov. seems okay with allowing people to pile onto the tube to go to work but not for some kids to queue up to take their exam? Hmm.

This is the one bit I really disagree with. Though I absolutely do not like the way the government have treated the situation with the tube (for example, lowering the service from once every 2-3 to once every 10 on some major lines), the tube is absolutely necessary and could not be lived without. People need to get to work, and a lot of people in London don't have a car and don't own or can't ride a bike. They rely on the tube to get to and from work. Personally, I think the tube service should have stayed as regular as it was, to decrease the number of commuters on a single train, allowing for easier social distancing. However, people do need to get to work somehow, and it isn't a viable option for them to shut down the tube. 

I don't think they've handled this the best they could (far from it), but I also don't think it's the worst, either. Worst case scenario, pretty much, is that people will need to take a gap year and reapply for 2021 entry. Of course, this isn't good, and has other implications, such as making getting offers for 2021 entry harder for both current year 12s and year 13s, but given the severity of what's going on, and considering how many people have and will still lose their lives to this, I don't think having to take a gap year is the end of the world."

I highly suggest trying to convince them, with written details to back up what you're saying, to let you take out a maintenance loan. There's almost no reason not to, no matter your parents' income.

Some centres would have multiple hunreds of pupils sitting the same exam, making social distancing impossible, not only in the exam hall (where there likely wouldn't be space to have everybody 2m apart from each other) but also queueing up before the exam, for example.

Plus I'd argue primary schools kids shouldn't be going back anyway, it sounds like a recipe for disaster to me. Good luck keeping a class of 5 year olds 2m apart from each other.

OculusQuest,fpnsvg5,t1_fpns5nq,1588771868.0,The shipping costs and times are a bit concerning but I can't seem to find anything dispatched from the UK except for some on ebay with no reviews and questionable looking quality. Thanks.
OculusQuest,fpno1oe,t3_gehgir,1588768626.0,"Any idea where to get adapters from in the UK? Thanks for this OP, I didn't realise they were even producing these any more."
heroesofthestorm,fpnlpkh,t1_fpmst10,1588766811.0,Not true. She doesn't passively regen energy while using her Q and for 2 seconds after using her Q.
beatsaber,fpkewxm,t3_gdzxjt,1588693435.0,"If you don't care about improvement, and just want to enjoy the game, then you already know your answer. Who cares what other people think?"
depression,fpgkb8g,t1_fpgecrg,1588604378.0,"Thanks. I'm not too bad and haven't been for a while, so don't want to seek it out but I appreciate the advice."
depression,fpge5e3,t1_fpgbxex,1588600836.0,"Yeah I am from the UK, lol. Though sadly I think (or at least, I've always been under the impression) that it's like that in most of the world, not being taken seriously enough."
osugame,fpgbxa3,t1_fpfun4c,1588599456.0,Yeah they are.
depression,fpgbqii,t1_fpgbe7n,1588599335.0,"Yes it probably depends. Over here where I live, getting government funded councelling is extremely hard due to it being underfunded. There's no way you'd be able to change. The whole thing is a joke."
heroesofthestorm,fpg0tqk,t1_fpdhtlu,1588590633.0,Hanzo doesn't have it baseline though.
depression,fpfz9bq,t3_gd89v5,1588589054.0,"This is exactly how I feel. Just because your problems are ""nothing"" compared to other people doesn't mean they're not real. That's not a healthy way to look at it because you end up thinking you don't deserve help because of it, and things won't get better while you think of it that way (trust me, from experience). 

I can relate to so much of what you said though. Issue is, it's a real pain with this current situation to do anything about it. I know it's easier said than done, especially with this current situation, but have you tried learning a hobby over this time? I don't know your interests, but maybe getting into art or learning a new instrument, or maybe learning programming or some other skill? I'd imagine that would really help to make it feel like you're not wasting every single day."
depression,fpfyiv9,t1_fpfnnl0,1588588294.0,I doubt that's an option considering they said that it's paid for by their local health services.
heroesofthestorm,fpd4ykr,t3_gciw70,1588519933.0,"I disagree with a lot of the people here. Body soak isn't dead, it just requires a lot more awareness of the enemy team. You can sit in lane and grab xp but it means you being visible to the enemies. It's definitely less viable but certainly not impossible, depending on map."
osugame,fpcv52h,t1_fpcsql8,1588513491.0,Either is fine.
