SuicideWatch,fo49h3h,t3_g5ejp3,1587500492.0,"I don't know what to say. But I've been there as well. Hit me up if you need someone to talk to. Might not have solutions for you, but if you want someone to listen to, I'm always up.

Also, talking to someone in person definitely is much better (my experience) but I've always found it's easier to do it over texts.

Take care brother"

SuicideWatch,fj2ibdb,t3_favuag,1582944399.0,"I was exactly at the same point. Then I figured I'll just make money and do things I've always wantad to do. I've got a project car that's shit right now. I'm saving up for it. I got a motorcycle last year, and started creating memories with it. Now, I'm also saving up for a trip. I'm focusing on myself, my physical, mental and emotional health.

It still gets so bad at times. People treat me nicely only when they need me. It always makes me feel alone and really bad to the point where death feels a comfortable choice. But I try to pick myself up. I'm trying to make myself a priority and just keep myself busy. I've also learned to manage my professional life a little better. There's still a very long way to go, and I do realise that most of these problems are only temporary.

I hope knowing all this helps you in some way."

SuicideWatch,fegdxip,t3_eoyk4y,1579089324.0,"Hey, it's okay. I'm the same way as you. For the last week or two, I've been feeling like there's nothing left for me in life anymore. Nothing excites me, there's nothing that I enjoy. I've been feeling very lonely, and have been wondering what am I living for now? What makes others enjoy their lives, and why am I lacking that in my life?

I am way too desperate to get out of this situation of mine, I feel stuck. There were things that people around me told me while growing up, things that one has to do in life in order to be happy. I come from a broken family, being a very emotional child/person, it completely destroyed me. I thought maybe a romantic partner will help me feel belonged, but 2 relationships ended draining me emotionally even more. Now, despite of wanting a partner, I know it's not in me to trust a person again. I'm almost destroyed emotionally. All I have is an emptiness in life. A void, that I tried to fill by purchasing things. But that makes me feel good only for a small time. Things cannot replace people.

I know, I need to start afresh. I'm taking a lot of baggage from my childhood. And unless I recover from my past, there's no future for me. The only reason I'm not killing myself is because of my younger brother, and a few friends. I don't want my death to be a burden, a regret or a sad and hurting memory to them. I know despite of this loneliness, my death's going to have an impact on people close to me. Though they might not understand the things I'm going through, they'll regret my death.

The mess is making me reconsider my end. The only way I have here is to start again. Need a way to deal with my past. And that's not easy for me. A part of me doesn't want to let go of it. There's a certain kind of comfort in this sadness.

So it's okay to feel the way you're feeling. It's okay to be where you are. I understand your pain. I don't have any reasons to live, or hope for the future. But I'm still going to do it nonetheless. Maybe one day I'll end up taking my own life, but till that time, I'll try not to.

And just like me, you've got time. And I'm here to help you in anyway possible. I know life sucks, and a lot more when you feel the way you're feeling right now. But let's take it slow. Let's just try to figure out one day at a time. I don't know you personally, but now that I know about your existence, I don't want you to keep going through all of it on your own. I'm not going to promise you anything, but maybe we can make it a bit better, a bit easier.

You aren't going to be alone in this. Go easy on yourself. You feel like a kind person."

SuicideWatch,fed6h77,t1_fed64co,1579001203.0,"I gave it a try, like almost an year ago when I was going through a break-up and then that thing cascaded into my professional life. Doesn't seem to help much"
SuicideWatch,fed5zfh,t1_fed55oo,1579000548.0,"Yeah, but I'm not sure if anyone can really help me here. I guess I know the answers to my own problems, I know the things that trouble me. But I also don't seem to have anything that can actually help me feel alive in the very sense of that word."
SuicideWatch,fed5v2y,t1_fed4mx6,1579000381.0,"That's exactly how I've been feeling, I don't know since when. We're scarily similar.

Well, nothing's going to change, at least not in our life time. That's how I feel about this entire thing that's going on. With technology, and the way this world has shaped out to be, people have started to lose value of things that are actually important. Real connections, deep conversations, unbiased acceptance of things, everything has been losing, and has become so rare. I don't know how the world was before we went hardcore capitalist, and started depending on technology so much. 

I used to be part of groups that I shared an idea with. We used to be on the same page, till the time it all became monotonous. People just form this idea of having to choose just one thing, one single thing and that's all. I find it stupid, and a very restricting way to live life. Loving something doesn't have to inspire hatred for a contrasting thing. And that's something I've found in every community. After a while, it gets toxic and draining.

That's the reason I've started to isolate myself. It's a bit better than the way things were earlier. But lonely.

I don't know if things will improve. I don't see any signs about that around me. In fact things have only started to get worse, and it's going to be a giant snowball, just rolling down a hill.

I don't have friends who'd actually care about the things that I do. Being honest with what I feel, I've lost many people close to me.

And it's better to rant, then just agreeing with everything that's going on in and around you. Actually, venting out helps a lot. Of course, it's not going to change anything. But it's okay the the way it is. I guess I'm just trying to find peace within myself, and harmony with things around me. People are going to the way they are. Social media is only going to make things worse. But there have been times when people have amazed me. When communities and individuals come together for something better, or worse.

Oh yeah, as much as I've grown a hatred towards this world and people, there are times when they make me re-think about the entire thing and the idea I've formed about this world. And even now, when I'm thinking about times the world, people, and friends have let me down, I can't seem to ignore the times where things have improved for me, even if for just a moment. Maybe that's how it's going to be.

And as ugly as it has gotten, there are a lot of things that I absolutely love about life. And at times, it makes me forget about the ugly side of it."
SuicideWatch,fed1cuh,t3_eoislu,1578993761.0,"Hey kid, I hear you. There's no way I'm going to justify the acts that you committed, but that doesn't mean this has to continue, or end in your death.

If you realize that you've done bad things to people, then also realize this thing that you yourself hold responsibility for your actions. Acknowledge that you made mistakes. You're just a person, we all make mistakes. But you can also learn from your mistakes. It's not too late for that. You cannot take back the things you did, but you can try to make things better around you and for people you associate with. There's still hope for you.

As a child, I've made some mistakes as well, but that was due to lack of understanding, empathy and a sense of what's right. With time, I realized my flaws, worked upon them and grew to be a lot better than what I've ever been. Does that mean I no longer make mistakes? Absolutely not. We all make mistakes, in-fact, we also hurt people whom we love. But we just have to live with that. And you can try to be better every day. Be someone you want to be, someone you can live with. Don't give in so easily to the way things are right now. It's going to be a struggle, a long walk. But will it be worth it? That's something only you can answer. You can start to be a better person from right now.

Better or worse, I'll just ask you to be a person you feel like being. It sounds like a bad advice, but you are a person, and there's someone that you want to be. Just go for it, live your life on your own terms. In a way that doesn't leave any regret for you.

Peace :)"
SuicideWatch,fed0la8,t3_eoirwz,1578992668.0,"No, I don't think your feelings are wrong in any way. The world has taken a very different turn, and a lot of things have changed in ways that only make us feel more isolated, and alone. But, there has to be more to it, right?

SuicideWatch,f933f8b,t3_e3feu1,1575048893.0,"Hey, I'll tell you my story. I was in my undergrad, and I failed in Maths in second year. During the span of four years, I gave multiple tries and I wasn't able to clear it. Then, when my graduation was closing in, I stopped freaking out, accepted the reality for what it was, and spent my time patiently preparing through the syllabus. And this time, I was able to get decent marks to clear the exams.

It was a really scary experience for me. The fact that I could clear every subject except for this one. Yet, just keeping myself together did it."
SuicideWatch,f932nl9,t3_e39vqb,1575048329.0,"I can relate to that. The only reason I'm not pulling the plug on myself is because I know on my way out, I'm going to hurt the ones closest to me.

I don't know, it's all very messed up and certainly not something that makes me want to look forward to another day of my life. So little to hold on..."
