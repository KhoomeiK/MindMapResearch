depression,eze0zmv,t3_d0kxgd,1567857648.0,"Honey, you don't need to go out with anyone at first. The first step of the process is to be comfortable with your own company. Enjoy yourself by your self. Treat and spoil yourself while outside. Eat at the mall. Get some ice cream or pizza. Shop. Do what you like. Learn to like how it is when you give time and attention to yourself. When you're finally okay, get a friend or two. Get used to having some company without depending too much on that company. I know it won't be easy but it's something. And good somethings always come from nothings."

OCPoetry,esxaw01,t3_c9dtdb,1562327924.0,"Self destruction. It's too hard to cope when you feel like every thing you do and say and think is a mistake. Like you don't know yourself or sometimes you drown in your self hatred, letting it consume you as all that you love and value slip between your fingers.

>but i can’t let my tears fall if i feel nothing at all.

This though, just wow. I really relate to this, like you're so.. Down and shit but you can't really grieve for yourself, you can't let any emotion out because despite everything, all you feel is the hollowness left in you. Leaving you a shell, unable to truly feel the depth of your emotion, like getting it behind a damn, or hiding it in a box, not to be opened at all."
OCPoetry,esx9w76,t3_c9cl81,1562327540.0,"Woah.. This is deep stuff indeed. 

>I'm alive as it seems

>Though I'm dead inside

This line is so on point. I really get how this feels, like you're dead, unfeeling and yet, knowing pain. But succumbing to it, embracing it. Like how your demons rule over you, making you question everyone and everything. Leaving you with no choice, or so it seems. Feeling empty most of the time, with only your demons as company, letting you feel, although not in a good way. And feeling as though you're the only one who has them, so you hide and never let anyone know of their existence."

The flow of the poem is good and the words, wow, it just.. Really gets to me. Lol. Sorry for saying wow too many times but ey, I really like it. I can't even think of any negative thing of this. Beautifully made. Everyone DOES have that longing for something that's out there and haven't quite known what it truly is but the longing is there, just waiting to be fulfilled by someone or maybe even someTHING."
OCPoetry,esss5ju,t3_c8zmy1,1562256890.0,"Beautiful. Simply beautiful. It's amazing how it portrays the hate born from love destroyed. The use of personification on hate is well done, it really got the vibe going and the mood of the poem was both dark and captivating. It truly captured the emotions it speaks of."
OCPoetry,essrk5p,t3_c8wcth,1562256637.0,"I love the composition of this poem, the use of colors makes a great imagery although a bit confusing because of lack of elaboration. But still, I think it's that mystery that gets you thinking and rethinking and just feeling the vibe of the poem.

In my opinion tho, this poem kinda relates to eating disorders such as bulimia, where the person eats what's in front of her and just lets its down, eating and eating and after that, feeling guilty. Getting that queasy feeling of eating too much and the insecurity that you're gaining weight which just turns your appetite to shit and makes you want to puke out everything you ate or just make it all go away. Like how you push all that bile out of your mouth, leaving you triumphant over the insecurity and yet, knowing that by doing so, it's slowly killing yourself."

Poetry,esreg83,t3_c8vmdl,1562223278.0,"I think the last line meant that even when the person, who wanted to give each and every one a reason, or even something for them to hold onto, or wanted to say so many things but just didn't know how, so left the envelope empty, despite having so many people there.

As someone who also went through this phase, I know how this feels. Having so many friends, so many choices, so many people you can talk to but can't, because sometimes, just because there's people there doesn't mean we can talk to them. And just because we can talk to them doesn't mean that they'll understand. And so it gets bottled up, left to be hidden and to rot under whatever defense or wall we have. Just waiting to be noticed again, and when it is, it's too overwhelming that it gets done before you even have a chance to consider otherwise."

He kept going on and on about suffering and all that shit and for his finalé, he said that atheists are into atheism because they aren't love and they're lacking in love because as it was said, God is love. I was doing my best not to jump him then and there. Like, come on. Can't the reason be because we're not stupid enough to believe in shit no one can prove exist? The Christians' version of history is very unreliable."

OCPoetry,esh0o39,t3_c7ihyr,1561977057.0,"Beautifully written. I really relate to this since I've been struggling with insomnia since I was 8. It's very difficult to overcome as you get used to it over time. It used to be so bad that I wouldn't get sleep for two to three days. I'm glad though that as bad as my insomnia is, I'm slowly getting over it now.

Why should I stay awake in the day? 

It's not like there's anybody else to play

Insomnia comforts me like nobody else

He says hes here to stay, and he picked me himself.

These lines really spoke to me. Kudos to you author! I really liked how you portrayed insomnia as a ""friend"". Again, awesome poem."

OCPoetry,esgyrso,t3_c7ogkg,1561974196.0,"Oh wow. That is such a strongly made poem. Its very on point regarding issues like sexual harassment especially from close family members. In this modern times, familial issues such as this are disgustingly commonplace. My heart goes to you if you actually experienced this, I myself have been through it, although not in the same circumstances as you, but I know how hard that kind of betrayal goes and it sure is ugly when it gets out. Despite the ending though, I admire the narrator for being brave enough to speak out about it because not everyone can do that. It's disappointing though that the people such as in your poem, are more sympathetic upon the ones who do it and not the victims themselves."
