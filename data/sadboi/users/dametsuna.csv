expats,fo99s9a,t3_g6fcha,1587613906.0,"Where are you moving to? For what reason (studies, work, internship,...)? 

What is the climate like? The people? Political situation? Do you fancy living in a large city or small town? Do you have relatives or friends there? 

Do they speak English there? Do you speak the language? How hard is it to learn the language? Will you be allowed to work? If you can work, what jobs are available to foreigners? Will those jobs require proficiency in the country’s language? What can YOU do? Do you have a skill that can turn into a part time job (cooking, crafting, physical labor, English teaching experience...), if you can’t look for a full-time job right away?

Do you need a visa? What kind of paperwork should you prepare if you need a visa? Will you be of age when you depart?

Those are some of the questions you should ask yourself first, and look up information. Moving countries is hard, especially for an 18 years old. I’m going to assume you only have a high school diploma (or the equivalent of it in England?) so it’s gonna be hard to find high-paying jobs that demand more qualifications.

Best is to look into which country offer free tuition university program (like France, Germany,...) and go as a student. That way you can still get a part time job to support yourself, get to experience life there with discounts/benefits accessible to European youths, and get a chance to earn qualifications for higher paying jobs.
