Parenting,fiqwba7,t1_fiq76xw,1582652814.0,"Yeah his bedtime routine is starting to become a 5 more mins thing lately. 

The hardest part is doing something one way at my house and a different way at his mother's but we do communicate a lot and help each other as neccessary"
Parenting,fiqw4si,t1_fipjdrh,1582652727.0,I'll be sure to bring it up at his next appt then thank you
Parenting,fiqw2wh,t1_fipj1pz,1582652700.0,"Yeah a lot of times I'll let him choose. ""Do you want this or that for dinner? What pajamas, these or those?"" And it works well

I was just distraught with how I behaved that morning because I dont normally get like that. 

This morning he was very good and all is well again"
Parenting,fipihgt,t1_fipi8t5,1582607957.0,"Thank you you're wonderful!

And yeah I was so upset I stayed from work and slept on and off. Trying to figure it out and go over it again, what should I have done, why did I do this, what's wrong with him, whats wrong with me

When I picked him up he was his normal quirky little self and didn't mention this morning's debacle 

At the end of the day I think I just wasnt as patient as I normally am, I know I didn't sleep enough the night before and he was pushing my buttons as soon as we woke up

Gonna try again tomorrow!"
Parenting,fipi72l,t1_fiphu7n,1582607702.0,"Yeah I'm not a fan of self diagnosing but occasionally some of the things he does, or the way he acts looks like he may be on the spectrum whether the degree or severity is small and barely noticed. Idk really. I'm sure he's fine but I dont want to find out 10 years from now when I could have found help for him earlier"
Parenting,fipi2h4,t1_fiphj01,1582607588.0,"Well thank you for your kind words, being a good dad is my biggest pride and also why I'm beating myself up so bad over today. He's very smart and usually so good for me I dont ever have to figure situations out. Normally a little distracting or diverting and were off to do whatever. 

I'm going to bed now so I guess I'll just see how tomorrow goes!"
Parenting,fipgjq9,t1_fipfvzr,1582606301.0,"He has a few things that kind of stuck out when you mentioned this, his food is always ""too hot dada"", even though it's practically cold. Same with his bath. I'm probably grasping at straws but who knows. 

And yes sometimes he's very upset and then snaps right out of it. But again I'm not sure if it's just normal stuff for a 3yo or what. 

I have little things going on too but I never looked at it as an issue really. Always wear jeans, always have my undershirt tucked in, pantlegs have to be around my boot and not bunched up or anything. Kind of always thought it was more an OCD kind of thing but it doesn't prevent me from doing anything so I've never looked into it

I'll add that book to my list though and maybe talk to his mlm other and his pediatrician thank you"
Parenting,fipffqw,t1_fiperit,1582605409.0,"I 100% agree with kids feeding off of my energy. And normally I keep myself under control and really give him the benefit of the doubt. And generally I let him choose a lot, maybe too much some days but I do think that today was a more of a fluke than anything. I'm just still really upset with myself for how upset I got with him. 

I will definitely look into the book though!

Mines been asleep for hours and I've been enjoying it in between feeling guilty about this morning lol 

Enjoy your mama time!!"
Parenting,fipf5hp,t1_fipeg5a,1582605182.0,Well tonight we just picked tomorrows outfit already. So tomorrow morning should go fine
Parenting,fipe8zu,t1_fipe3vj,1582604492.0,"I tried explaining to him that it was wear these pants or were leaving in your underwear but he wouldnt budge

And since its winter here I didn't want to take him out in the cold in his little underwear. 

I have heard from people at work that have done that and it's worked though!"
Parenting,fipe2zu,t1_fipdpus,1582604368.0,"Yeah sorry it was so confusing it was all hard to put into words. And yes it's more like jeans that he doesn't like wearing. Any sort of nicer pants pretty much. I wonder if that could be it

Any other tips or things to look for? 

I appreciate the feedback"
Parenting,fipcw9x,t1_fipcodf,1582603491.0,Yeah that's my big problem. I do let him decide a lot of stuff and let things go but I fear that he will push me more and more. Even bedtime tonight was a disaster when normally he's very good for me. I'm just gonna let him have a few more small victories

apexuniversity,ffduwy2,t1_ffci2or,1579829537.0,"Thats the biggest thing I came to say. Try to relax a little, I know its hard to just do it. Hotdrop a few times, get used to getting in engagements your not ready for. 

Specifically for this clip after rezzing your teammate I would have moved to a good position, possibly up higher than everyone and taken a second to see what was going on. Try to get some decent hits with grenades if you have them. 

My only other tip would be to try snd carry a gun with better range. PK and Alt are both close range, I didn’t notice how early/late in the match this was so I don’t know if you were just under geared or not

Just keep practicing!"
