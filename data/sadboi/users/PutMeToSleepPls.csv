I was super tangled up in my sheets for some reason and each second of me freeing myself, getting up and going to the light switch was such a sickening battle with my mind to block out fear.

I know I used to absolutely ram a mechanical pencil (which basically has a thin metal piece at the top) without second thoughts into my arm to release feelings that boiled up being friendzoned. For me it was always something that happened almost too quickly to control. The best thing that happened to me then was that my brother broke and tossed that pen away when I opened up a little bit in a very manic episode. Its really about first getting rid of triggers and utensiles that you can quickly grab to do it in a heartbeat. 

If its done calculated and careful though, I havent experienced such a thing and I believe you need to fight the mental battle and win over in order to control this emotion. Such strong and overwhelming emotions can be channeled so much better in so many other ways, like beating the shit out of your pillows.

That you do your best at work. There's so many things we can do to change our lifes. You know it probably feels like it will always feel this way because good things just never come to us, we have to sort of find them and work for them while bad thing come to us for free.
