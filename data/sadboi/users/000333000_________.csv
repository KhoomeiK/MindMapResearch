I know know the pain and I know you want answers. I don‚Äôt have the answers you seek but I do believe you will find them. How do you see yourself dealing with uncomfortable emotions while sober? What do you hope to achieve while sober that you feel you can‚Äôt when alcohol is in your life? These questions are ones I asked myself that helped me envision who I want to become and that vision helps me keep sobriety in the forefront of my mind and stick with it each day. It‚Äôll get better, even if it gets a little worse first, it‚Äôll get better. I believe in you!"
