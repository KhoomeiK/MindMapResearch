depression,fpoa6qc,t3_gea6mo,1588781032.0,"Sometimes... I've had best friends and I've gone long periods without being attached to the hip with someone. Every once in awhile you gotta get back in tune with yourself. I think its natural. My last best friend got really creepy towards me after entering into a polyamorous relationship... He just thought he could hit on anyone he wanted, including me. A mutual friend stepped in on my behalf because it was clearly making me incredibly uncomfortable and kinda brutally called him out on it. Even though I didn't say anything, he blocked me on all social media and I haven't heard from him since. I'm not saying all people are like that but I've learned to like my personal bubble quite a bit after that experience and see great benefits to keeping people at arms length... I'm kind to others but never expect the same in return. I have a few close friends who I love very much, but again, i keep them at arms length. After my former best friend blocked me on social media, these people stopped asking me to hang out. Eventually we stopped communicating all together (they were taking his side). Recently however they reached out and apologized for disowning me. We are close friends now and I've certainly forgiven them, but I remember what happened and will never risk my own neck for them. Ever lol"

I have met a lot of people who try and profit socially off of the countless lives taken and destroyed simply for being who they are, a gay person. I don't appreciate those people. There is an undeniable majority of ""queer"" people who pretend in order to get something out of it... Personally I think they want attention.

There were a lot of trees and it was kind of windy and it was far away but there was no doubt in my mind they were real people. Dark shadow people. There must of been hundreds of them surrounding this one person who was holding objects above the fire. The rest who were too far away to stand around the fire were dancing wildly. I was with a friend and it took a while for it to register that he was not able to see what I was seeing. It was so real to me and he just wasn't seeing what I was seeing. It was a very strange conversation. I was freaking out at the thought of all these people dancing in the woods. What were they doing there? Who are these people? Are they dangerous? Why are they doing this? All these questions were flooding my mind and he wasn't able to understand why I was freaking out. It was very upsetting for him and that's when I realized he wasn't seeing what I was seeing. It was like if there's an elephant standing 3 feet in front of you and the person next to you has no idea. It took me a few minutes to realize I was the only one seeing it. As soon as it occurred to me that maybe what I was seeing wasn't real and that maybe I was hallucinating or something the shadow people who were furthest away from the fire and closest to the car we were sitting at began to notice ME. They realized I was aware of them and then they became aware of me. A few of them walked up to my car and continued dancing. It was very very real. At the time I swore they were Native Americans. Why they were revealing themselves to me? I could never begin to answer that. If it was all a figment of my imagination, why did I see Native Americans? I never think about them. Ever. Ever. I have no reason to. I was so traumatized and confused by the experience I couldn't help but look into the history of the place where I saw them. All the history checks out. I even spoke to one of the members of the historical society of our town about what happened to me. She told me that everything that I had seen there is all historically accurate. She told me I must have seen the spirits of the Native Americans who lived there. To this day I have no idea why. All I know is I saw what I saw and I will never forget. Whether a hallucination or something paranormal, I saw what I saw."
