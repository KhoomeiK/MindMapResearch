Now I have one task for you, Tina a miserable person and help them get through this. I believe our mentally bricked community asks for support when needed but doesn't really contribute back. I wanna start an initiative, if anyone in Limehouse or in London needs mental, professional support please reach out to me here.. folks who have recovered, they're more like us and we need help each other out since we understand the pain the post.
We can discuss more..
Take care !
Stay Strong,"
mentalhealth,fnps53q,t3_g30uc2,1587151000.0,"Dude, I went through the same thing when I was depressed. Lack of sleep and extreme stress and anxiety led me to lack of sleep which led to more stress and anxiety. Please stay with your fam, take meds, exercise extensively, quit/ take a break from your job or studies and just focus on getting better..
I realize the value of sleep now..
Don't fuck around with it.."
mentalhealth,fmarzom,t3_ftv4zn,1585905477.0,"Stay with her dude, keep engaging her in activities, like movies games or etc. Make her stay close to her friends and family circle. You have to be absolutely sure she doesn't stay alone, get into her own chain of thoughts and does anything stupid.
Stay strong, we're all here to help you..
Somehow get a therapist at home or convince her to take professional help..
Take care buddy !
All strength and love to you guys.."
mentalhealth,fljo3yo,t3_fovy8a,1585220768.0,"I also thought like this once. Asked another guy at therapist what's his age was. Told him I was 22 and he said it doesn't matter. Things are different for everyone and circumstances might lead to happiness or sadness so don't take it seriously. In my opinion to get out of this state
1. Accept you're not well. Fuck society and everyone. Accept it. 
2. Find what went wrong, ask for help and try to move on.
3. Most important stay in touch with family and friends, ask for their support and grow yourself.
Please reach out to me if you need more mental and professional help.
Cheers !
We're with you !

Apply in all these places. They'll pay 70k + 30k for sure for a PhD is you're good in coding which I assume you would be after your PhD in AI. Don't go into service start ups. Look for machine learning Engineer or AI scientist roles.

cscareerquestions,fke1yid,t3_fhvp45,1584102992.0,"Bloomberg is a s#it for a tech company. If you're at the end of your career and the work you do doesn't matter much, and you wanna earn good money Bloomberg is ideal for you, but if you're serious about your skills, career and future, don't fall for this honey trap and look for better even low paying options. Bloomberg doesn't pay you to learn new things and write new products for them, they pay to NOT learn new tech, get stuck in their old tech and be ignorant from open source stuff. 5 years later, you find yourself technically backwards than you were when graduated from university, no drive or motivation for writing good code, spending more time debugging old shit code than re write new code.  
If you are young (and European) please avoid Bloomberg at any cost. Its a black hole, if you stay there long enough, you won't be able to get out anywhere in Industry. They sell themselves as tech company they're more serviced by finance company.  
Another reason to not join Bloomberg, they have terrible leadership. People who have stayed in company for 8 years or more, who don't know anything about ope sources, still use 20yr old Bloomberg tech only will be your leaders. One of my close friend's TL didn't know how a simple for loop operates (though i++ or ++1 would give different result).  
You have to be utterly stupid or ignorant if you still want to join Bloomberg. I you are an immigrant, join Bloomberg, do internship or Industrial Placement, find an okay company, and leave the company within 6 month. Lots new start ups in London are sponsoring visa now.

You don't get to judge me. I know where I came from, I am not entitled. I've fought at every stage in my life and I will continue for it.My manager specifically told me that, we want you to recover first, and it won't affect your eval. If I had known otherwise I would've quit early, gotten recovered and then applied for jobs. Why lie ? You corporate HR pig is of course gonna take their side you privileged piece of shit.  


I hope you'll realize this when someone close to you goes through mental health issues dumb fuck. Till then go ahead and lick you boss's ass to keep your job talentless corporate pig."
