AskMeAnythingIAnswer,fhe9uxn,t3_f0lcum,1581517544.0,"I used to be in a psych ward a couple of years back for schizoaffective disorder, so I can definitely understand how monotonous it can get. We weren't allowed to use any sort of technology either, phones and computers were completely banned from the premises. How are you holding up in regards to your mental state?

Hope all is well."
AskDocs,fh1qakt,t1_ff2kftv,1581221089.0,"Hello. I forgot to add that I take antidepressants and anti-psychotics, and I believe that the anti-psychotic is what is making me feel so fatigued. I will try to discuss the results with my psychiatrist about the possibilities of lowering the dosage of the medication or changing it so that I can hopefully solve this problem. Thank you for helping."
lonely,ffhmqfj,t3_eths5c,1579942739.0,"I feel as though as a relationship will benefit both people who happen to be lonely and not have that many friends. I personally think that the problem is that many people are afraid of crossing that boundary because of the commitment that is involved with one. I've had two unsuccessful relationships because of that reason alone, and it hurts knowing that you try to put so much into something that you want to see succeed but it just doesn't.

For better or worse, most people want to see what you have to offer them in terms of the relationship, which can mean anything in this case, but it usually revolves around sex, money and some other tangible object that can be given away. I really wish that that isn't the case in modern dating, but here we are."
AskDocs,ff2jkwh,t1_ff29mgt,1579509061.0,I'm not entirely sure. It started getting really bad during fall of last year but I didn't really do anything different. I will try my best not to self medicate though.
lonely,fem266m,t1_fem1hyz,1579237305.0,"I am sure that you will do great, just try to find your best rhythm and it will be a nice cakewalk."
schizophrenia,fem1ni7,t1_fem0zl2,1579236843.0,"Why thank you.

I used to be apart of some meetings where people like me were able to talk about different things and life in general. Sadly the group meetings were only seasonal but I've meet some great people along the way. It helped a lot and I am sure it will help you as well."
lonely,fem1fyq,t1_fem12z3,1579236658.0,"I suffer from the same problem too, my take on it is to find a way to not get attached too fast without knowing the person enough to make a connection, otherwise they may get the wrong impression. There have been many times where I was  enamored with people that I would like to meet, only to get rejected later on. I've learned to just take things slow at first and progress from there when I am talking to new people, and it helps a lot considering how bad my social anxiety is."
lonely,fem0wsa,t3_epv57d,1579236190.0,"I tend to always make mistakes when I attempt to meet new people as well, it is something that I have never really managed to control. My anxiety almost always climbs and jumps whenever I try to talk to people. I know for a fact that you are not crazy at all, it is something that simply needs support and encouragement to better yourself around others."
schizophrenia,fem0eeh,t3_epuwkx,1579235755.0,"You are not a failure for having a mental illness. Simply having an illness does not prohibit the life and happiness that does belong to you. Many people can have rich and satisfying lives with schizophrenia, it just takes the right amount of positives for you to explore and receive. Having a great support system where people care about your illness can be life changing, and I imagine that it can be of great benefit for you to explore your local communities to find the right type of people who will gladly help and support you through your struggles."
