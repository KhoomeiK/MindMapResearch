socialskills,fr28n27,t3_gm4c5n,1589833037.0,This happened to me. But about six years passed and i got it back but like... a nicer version. So you do miss the old you but you are not lost forever. You will feel like a person eventually. The best advice I have is to not avoid things that scare you and try to cut all toxicity out of your life as quickly as feels right to you. That includes anything online that makes you feel bad and any friends irl that make it harder to recover. Then just delve into what you enjoyed before until it starts to feel natural again. You will come back bit by bit but its a big process. Seriously go forward positively it helps so much.

Animesuggest,fqbbwzb,t3_ghi2rb,1589234173.0,"Im going to try and recommend ones i haven’t seen on here yet:

You could try Another!! Its a slow horror anime but it is so worth watching I promise. Just be mindful the deaths are kind of upsetting.

Deadman wonderland is also really great if you don’t mind endings being cut short/kind of messy I’m currently rewatching it because its so good. This one has been mentioned but i love it. A lot of people hate the dub on this i personally don’t mind it but you may want to view it subbed..?

Hell girl! Its an episodic series where you can exchange your soul in order for a small girl to punish people. Each episode is unique and creepy and its all about cursing bad people.

Pet shop of horrors is really old but really lovely. Its kind of like gremlins but with humanoid monsters and told by the shop owner. The horror is creative and the world is really cool.

If you like vampires Blood+ is pretty good! Its based on an early 2000s film called Blood: the last vampire

Serial experiments Lain is a psychological cyberpunk horror anime about VR and online communication. Somewhat R rated but still solid."

MeetNewPeopleHere,fpuo2nt,t3_gfdvxj,1588918241.0,"tbh i find that thats a good thing honestly. It weeds out anyone you wouldn’t want around anyways. Would you actually want a friend who only answered you back because they thought you were single?? Probably not. That shows they were being kind of a creep to start. 

You can use it like a prevention step. “Does this person actually want to hang out with me or are they being weird cus It looks like I’m single” if you mention the boyfriend do they keep talking to you?? If yes there you go thats a good friend. If not then ew drop them you don’t want them around."
Animesuggest,fpnfowk,t3_ge8oam,1588761290.0,"Check older animes! They have a lot less fanservice in general. 

My best recommendation is Cardcaptor Sakura though. It was my first manga. Shes actually portrayed as a dumb jock that likes cute things rather than being fanservice cute. Also shes like 10 so shes not fanserviced period. In fact half the time she forgets to use magic and just tries to punch things so she gets all the battle shots too. And her main sidekick is her female best friend who has at least three real hobbies she regularly participates in and is canonically gay. Which is better than ive seen most animes do.

If you havent watched inuyasha its also lovely. kagome is fully fleshed out as a character and has an entire homelife separate from inuyasha on top of her being the main heroine and never really being fanserviced at all. In fact its the opposite.

Then theres ouran high school host club where theres a little fanservice but shes usually dressed like a boy and its not sexy and her voice is super deep. the whole joke is shes ace as hell and somewhat genderfluid. fanservice is from the male half of the series.

And fruits basket: again all fanservice is men and the girl gets a full backstory/saved through friendship thing. It is a romance story but the girl isnt gawked at at all."
ShouldIbuythisgame,fpn8dit,t3_geazgt,1588753786.0,This wont be as popular as some of the other ones on here but I've always liked dragon age for things like this. Its all about having your friends stand by you in the darkest times and showing you there is light at the end of every bad time. The beginning is slow to start but it always feels like coming back home. And every bad time I've had its made me feel better. Maybe instead of anger embrace the emotions and sit with them for a bit. Your heart heals faster if you embrace your feelings and accept that better things will come. And friendships and time heal everything. Good luck friend!

MakeNewFriendsHere,fp98krh,t3_gbyiyp,1588418429.0,I think about her every day. But she chose to cut me off and never gave me a reason why during the darkest period of my life. She decided she didn’t care about me anymore and didn’t think i was worth knowing why. I will miss her forever but she chose someone else over me and after 10 years of being by her side i deserved an explanation and i never got one. Thinking back on her just leaves me with regret and the feeling that she never cared in the first place. Its healthier to move on and realize if they wanted to be there they could. At any time. But they keep choosing not to be. So the best you can do is pretend it never happened and it didn’t hurt as bad as it did. New friends always spring up eventually.

socialskills,fji6vvi,t1_fjgy32t,1583361616.0,"If they themselves are being cruel to you thats entirely different. If they don’t respect YOU then you need to get out of there because that will cycle horribly. My response was more about disrespecting other people. Ive had over 15 friends leave *just* because they were in love with me and i was aro/ace and could not reciprocate the feeling. They hated this and because i would never be a viable romantic partner in the way they wanted i was no longer worth being friends with. At first i thought i was just cruel accidentally so they left but no i asked and they all said it was just too hard. Every single one of them had stuck around only for a reward and not for me as a person. When i actually did attempt dating a person the last of them left. So if its just about love don’t hurt your friends cus they care about you very deeply and love fades over time.

But if that person hurts you, disrespects you or mocks you they never deserved your friendship to begin with."
socialskills,fji5v1p,t1_fjhoj6b,1583361108.0,Oh then yes he absolutely can go fuck himself. The question asked was “should i leave the relationship cus I’m in love with them” which is cruel if the other person did nothing. It was not phrased “should i leave this relationship because they are a dick to me constantly” I did not intend to hurt anyone i am sorry. If it is simply because you love them too much i find that that is rude to your friend but if you love them and they are actively harming you because they are a really bad person that is an entirely different kind of reason to leave and I’m really sorry that happened to you man <:0
socialskills,fjgnq6k,t1_fjgb7wc,1583331480.0,"Consider this from the other persons perspective: it makes them feel like you never cared about them as a friend if them not being romantically interested in you back was all it took to break said friendship. Thats extremely disrespectful to your friend. You are telling them that the rest of your journey together never mattered simply because they don’t like you back.

And now think for a second. What if said person has a significant other and thats why you choose to leave. So just because this person is now in a relationship you are just done with them? They are past their usefulness to you? If you really love them like you say you do wouldn’t loving them platonically as a friend and showing you care about them despite that be just as important?

The friend didn’t do anything wrong the friend did not hurt you the friend simply existed."
socialskills,fjfc402,t3_fcxz6h,1583288702.0,Im not one to be harsh with answers but if you want a perspective from the other sides perspective: most of my male friends have done this to me at one time or another and i am glad they left as they were not strong enough to just be friends with me. It would have made me feel horrible and grossed out had they stayed knowing that thats all they thought of me as. As of current day all these friends have me blocked because i told them unless they were strong enough to be my friend and *just* my friend then i didn’t want them hanging around me any more as i found it disrespectful that they kept asking me out when i was dating other people. Its a hard decision but if you feel you cant be happy just being his friend you should move on. But i also want you to be aware that they hurt me on a level i will never actually be over so make sure you let him know kindly that he does have worth outside of being a romantic partner you are simply not strong enough to be around him and be prepared for when he might feel the same.

howyoudoin,es9o1dw,t3_c6crc3,1561740601.0,"The big problem for me is that Ross never gives a real apology at any point. In the one with the beach he cheats on Bonnie with Rachel then when she gives him the letter he doesn’t even bother reading it because its “too boring” and later gets into a hissy fit because it asks him to take responsibility for his actions. 

Even if it doesn’t count as cheating its a betrayal of trust and he didn’t care enough about her feelings to apologize properly. Thats not a good partner. Instead he emotionally abuses and bullies her. As someone who has been in this situation the emotional impact is horrible. It can drive you crazy. And if your partner is not emotionally supportive its so much worse. He uses a technicality to get out of a morally wrong situation then refuses to own up to any of it. He cant claim he’s not a cheater when a few hours before that point he betrayed bonnie.

But ultimately its not about if he cheated or not its whether or not he used this situation to treat her with respect and understanding or use it to hurt her and he chose to hurt her. Which is even worse when you consider he knew how it felt (from the whole issue with mark) thats textbook signs of an abusive male partner."
