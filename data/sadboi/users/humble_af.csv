""Instead of mask wash your hand"" doesnt work when the goddamn virus is floating in the air and you inhale it. It is a scientifically established fact that the virus spreads through both droplet and airbone.

I'm nothing spcial but my point is not just me, I guarntee you A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY, if you give them money & resources of U.S government, will give you masks in 7 days. 
In fact, I can tell you this. There is already legal proccesses and ways for U.S government to compell OR EVEN FULLY TAKE OVER 3M manufacturing & all other mask manufacturers in U.S and produce masks 24/7.

2. Infrastructure, money, whatever you name it. I rightly refuse to be convinced that RICHEST COUNTRY ON EARTH cannot produce masks for even half of its population in 3 months time. Even government is not saying they cant produce. They're just saying ""YOU DONT NEED THEM BECAUSE THEY DO NOT WORK"".
3. N95 masks do protect and our government, like every other government in the world, can & MUST educate public about right size & proper care & handling of maks. It's really not rocket science. Can be done in a small 1 page brochure. This cannot be the reason we are telling 390 million people MASKS DONT WORK, DONT WEAR THEM. 
4. I've seen many chinese research already established it's airborne. Regardless, even if droplet, which it is not just droplet, but even if just droplet, it would make no sense to tell people MASKS DONT WORK, DONT WEAR MASKS. I literally know people who have N95s but dont wear them becuz they hear government say they dont work and they believe government over me :) 
5.Masks like other commodities get stolen. Good news is this is not that complicated. I'm sure there are thousands of ways already developed to handle commodities that may be stolen. I dunno. How do we protect firearms? Diamonds? Rolex watches? But we dont know how protect Masks needed to keep Americans alive!? Doesn't make sense. Also, if you provide your population with masks, like other countries, nobody needs to steal them. 
Also 5. Of course the more we produce the more people buy. But that's not a new thing. Everything is like that. i.e. Cigarette companies do not shut down producing cigarettes because people bought supply of one store? They produce more meanwhile and replace it. Again, it's really not that much of a complicated challenge to say because of this we have to go and tell the poor American people that MASKS DONT PROTECT THEM. 

ALSO --> 6. I have a question for you. Obviously healthcare workers must be far beyond well equipped, no questions there, but as a healthcare worker, are you not guys ""MUCH"" better off if government educate people correctly and provide them with masks so they dont get sick in thousands and millions?

Even during the congressional hearing yesterday Dr.Fauci when asked about how many people he thinks will be infected insisted that he ""cannot give any numbers because it literally directly depends on when you take what action"" which makes perfect sense because the disease penetration is directly related on how fast a government take action and what actions to take. And GOVERNMENT actions and decision making in all countries means those in political positions. For example, if a government keep ahead of the curve by distributing sanitizers, masks, putting regions under quarantine early, the damage can be reduced to ""ZERO"" in theory and very minimal in real world. 
On the other hand, if a government be behind the curve i.e. fails to properly test, fails to educate public and provide them with masks & sanitizers, and even tell them that MASKS DONT WORK, or delay in shutting down businesses or quarantine regions, then the damage of the virus can be catastrophic.

WHY ARE WE NOT PRODUCING MASKS 24/7, IN THIS THREE MONTHS TIME, and instead telling people MASKS dont work so they spread the virus between them? Do you really not see the tragedy here? 
You say they wanna protect healthcare workers first. THAT, will only make sense if they were saying ""HEALTH WORKERS ARE PRIORITY. WE FIRST GIVE THEM MASK. THEN PROVIDE FOR POPULATION AFTER THAT"", but they're not saying this at all. They're saying MASKS DONT WORK, FOR THREE DAMN MONTHS. And no update as to when or how if at all there will be any masks. Which take me to the next point.. 
See the irony here --> You cannot tell people to do exactly what will make them sick and then think because you protected healthcare workers they can handle this. Protected healthcare workers may be able to handle 500,000 sick people. BUT WHEN YOURE TELLING PEOPLE ""DO NOT WEAR MASKS JUST GO OUT UNPROTECTED"" I GUARANTEE YOU IN SHORt tIME YOU WILL HAVE ""MILLIONS"" OF SICK PEOPLE AND then it will not matter at all whether you protected your healthcare workers or not they just can't help.

2. If we really don't have enough masks, why our gov, CDC, media, tell us ""DONt WEAR MASK, MASKS DONT WORK"" instead of telling us that we must wear mask to protect against the disease and when masks will become available? 
3. How are masks in shortage in the first place? The outbreak started ""3"" months ago. Are you really wanting me to find it believeable that richest most advanced country in the world could not produce simple plastic/foam/paper masks even just for 30% of it's population in 3 months?!?!?!
4.To tell people that you must buy the right size of mask and dispose them or that this is the 3 steps of properly putting mask on and off is really really REALLY not that complicated to come out say ""MASKS DONT WORK"". Again I refer to IRAN since its the worst economically off country among those hit by the virus, even IRAN educated its population early on about these basics.. 
5. The fact that COVID-19 is Aerosol, just like all the other Coronaviruses is not even in doubt. There are, and have been for very long time, massive amount of scientific papers on Pubmed saying COVID-19 is aerosol like other Coronaviruses. We even knew this long before nCov. That's why when you were a child they teach you when you get flu you should wear mask!
6. Are you really in your sane mind and claiming that it's more likely to wear N95 ask but then somehow manage to pick up a virus and place it in your mouth COMPARED to going bare unprotected in front of a virus? Basically what you're claiming is that if I'm about to talk to someone with Coronavirus and I have N95 mask in my hand I should not put my mask on because by doing so maybe I touch my face and put a viral particle in my mouth and thus I should go talk to this corona person without a mask? That is the worst recommendation in human history."
CoronavirusUS,fke3uy4,t1_fke3ftw,1584104470.0,I am calm. I asked a question. I'm eager for the answer. Maybe I should say I'm actually not calm. I feel terrorized. I'm proplexed! Every TV channel ever website I turn into does not say a word about educating American public to wear mask and informing us about when masks are becoming available. You're right that I'm not calm atm. If you're calm I think you're not seeing the depth of the tragedy that is about to unfold soon.
CoronavirusUS,fke3p9s,t1_fke3l6i,1584104347.0,Media repeats whatever CDC & GOV tell them to repeat. The reason why media says this is that CDC's guidance says this. Go on CDC website nowhere it is suggesting people to wear masks but instead telling people that MASKS DONT WORK and PEOPLE DONT NEED MASK.
CoronavirusUS,fke3jzf,t1_fke2s5g,1584104235.0,"I think you're truly not understanding that these are 2 different things and not interrelated. I wash my hands. Doctors wash their hands. It makes no sense for you to tell me ""You can't wash your hands, because doctors must wash their hands in hospital"". Like it's not like Soap or foam masks are diamond or scarce or anything that it cannot be the case that both I wash my hand and doctors wash their hand without anyone being without soap? 
We are the richest country on earth. Outbreak started ""3"" months ago. U.S is literally the last country that the virus arrived at, as expected. You're telling me ""3"" months the richest country on earth could not provide mask even if just for 25% of its population given that even in IRAN, Singapore, Italy, wherever you name it, at least 50% of the population have access to masks?!"
CoronavirusUS,fke2oaa,t1_fke224v,1584103559.0,"I don't get it. Why is there a shortage? Richest country on earth with such massive healthcare need and 400 million people, at the very very very very least must have 800 million masks stockpiled. It's very very VERY basic to understand this as matter of public & national security. 
On top of that, when your 800 stockpile runs out, by that time the Richest cuontry on earth is fully capable of producing goddamn face masks, millions of them. How is it that the outbreak started ""3"" months ago, United States of America could not produce enough masks in 3 months for even 25% of its citizens?"
CoronavirusUS,fke2dye,t1_fke247d,1584103333.0,"Again, repeated reply, people before you said all these & I responded. 
The message U.S & Media give to people is not ""HEY, MASKS ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT, IF YOU COULDNT FIND AT YOUR STORE NEXT WEEK NEW MASKS BEING DISTRIBUTED"", instead, they're literally boldly saying ""MASKS DO NOT WORK, DO NOT WEAR THEM""! Which is not just a bold lie with consequences, but generally a very very stupid strategy. Because for how long are you gonna keep telling this to people and encourage them to go in front of a deadly virus unprotected?!"
CoronavirusUS,fke27w7,t1_fke20d4,1584103201.0,"You're failing to comprehend the fact that DOCTORS NEEDING MASKS has nothing to do with PEOPLE NEEDING MASKS. In all countries, even in Iran which has been under sanctions for past 40 yrs and economy is severe, both DOCTORS have MASKS, and many people wear masks too. Why are you talking like we're talking about diamonds here and they're scarce somehow? Are you telling me United States, the richest country on earth, cannot produce plastic face masks in 3 months since December?"
CoronavirusUS,fke216j,t1_fke1g99,1584103053.0,"I wouldnt hoard toilete paper. I didn't. Why the hell would I do that? You don't need TOILETE PAPER to survive a deadly virus. You need MASKS, PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. What does it have to do with toilete paper? 
& I know masks are gone, I just don't understand 1) How could they be out of masks and not have stockpile, I mean the richest country in the world !? and 2) Why are they saying ""MASKS DONT WORK"" instead of saying YOU NEED MASKS, WE DONt HAVe NOW, WE WILL DISTRIBUTe NEXT WEEK. !? Again, it's not like you wanna send a rocket to mars. It's a goddamn plastic mask !"
CoronavirusUS,fke1ksb,t1_fke16n9,1584102680.0,"What you said in 20 line is simply this --> Masks do work, just make sure you get the right size and remember that they're disposable. Which isn't really that hard to understand or tell people. Why do you tell people ""MASKS DONT WORK, DONT WEAR THEM""?"
CoronavirusUS,fke1djl,t1_fke1526,1584102510.0,"OK but that's exactly the question.. 
That how exactly is this possible that.. 
1) In ALL COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD, less or more, people find masks. In better off countries like Singapore or Hong Kong govs distribute free sanitizer & masks to protect people.. even IRAN, 40 yrs under SANCTIONS, 70% of citizens wear masks in public.. How on earth we are the RICHEST country on earth and even 10% of our public cannot get their hands on MASKS?!?!
2) Even if we don't have masks, why on earth, is government not saying ""Hey we dont have masks now, it'll arrive next week, or after that"". Like why are we acting like somehow Mask is rocket science and richest country in the world cannot get or produce masks!? Like they're boldly saying ""MASKS DONT WORK, DO NOT WEAR MASK"""
CoronavirusUS,fke11qq,t1_fke0hyi,1584102233.0,So are we now putting poor 390 million people in front of a deadly virus that they can breath in while telling them MASKS DONT WORK DONT WEAR THEM? I mean it kind of sounds like premeditated murder..
CoronavirusUS,fke0h85,t1_fkdyraz,1584101750.0,"I.E I wash my hands with soap. You can't tell me I shouldn't wash my hands with soap because medical workers need to wash their hands with soap. It's not mutually exclusive or dependent events. Both I must wash my hand with soap, and medical workers must wash their hand with soap. These two events are irrelevant."
CoronavirusUS,fke0cez,t1_fkdzdd2,1584101637.0,"People hoarding them? I don't get it. Why would you hoard mask, unless it actually cannot be found. Many countries give daily supply of Mask and sanitizer to people. The only reason now it is totally foreseeable people, RIGHTLY, hoard masks is tht GOVERNMENT IS SAYING THERE ARE NO MASKS, AND THERE WILL NOT BE IN FUTURE TOO ! Like wtf?"
CoronavirusUS,fke07p8,t1_fkdzqb9,1584101525.0,"If that's the case,
1) Why do they insist to say ""MASKS DONT WORK"" and literally say ""DONT WEAR MASK"" instead of simply saying ""We dont have masks now, it will be in the stores next week"". I mean.. We are United States.. we are talking plastic masks.. It's not Rocket Science. and 
2) With this kind of messaging, how does this help to contain the disaster if you wanna brainwash people into thinking MASKS don't work and send them unprotected in front of the virus? Like what's the plan exactly? Are we thinking we're gonna give masks to 10,000 healthcare and let millions go unprotected and get sick and then those doctors will somehow cure these people?"
CoronavirusUS,fkdzy3f,t1_fkdypvo,1584101291.0,"Good point. At first that answer may seem correct.. But it's kind of mind buggling.. 
Take China for example. If you don't wear mask in Hubei police arrest you. Not just healthcare workers, ALL PEOPLE MUST WEAR MASK. But it's not just China. In any country that you look at everyone wears mask. Italy.. South Korea.. IRAN with huge sanctions more people have masks than in U.S.A.. 
Also.. If what you say is the case, thn why don't say ""We don't have masks right now, we will produce by next week and give you all!"" ? I mean.. It's just a simple Mask.. It's not Rocket science! Why are they promoting ""MASKS DONT WORK"" and go as far as telling people ""DONT WEAR THEM"" ?! 
And .. Given that we are the richest country in the world, how exactly we ended up sooooooo pooor that we have to tell millions of people ""DONT WEAR MASK, MASKS DONT WORK""? How exactly we're poorer than rest of the world now?"
CoronavirusUS,fkdznlb,t1_fkdyraz,1584101031.0,"And why we both cannot have Masks? Again, like other countries in the world? I.e. in China if you don't wear mask police will arrest you. Did I mention we are the richest country in the world?"
