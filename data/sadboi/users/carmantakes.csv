greysanatomy,flygxc2,t1_flxz8u9,1585601944.0,"I kinda like the plot twist. So I feel like Owen was just Teddy’s grief partner, helped her through the hardest time in her life, she loves him but not like that and I think she is realizing that now. With Henry, Teddy actually loved him and that was love at first sight I believe. With Alison, which was so long ago, but when you name your child after them and wear that damn scrub cap every day, I feel like that is more of a friend connection. Because with a friend, you want their memory to live on. But I feel like for me, and like for Meredith with derek’s scrub cap, and Bailey’s full name being Bailey Derek Shepherd, it’s much harder to do those things. So that’s why Meredith no longer wears Derek’s scrub cap and why no one called Bailey by his middle name. I just feel like it would hurt too much. When the love of your life dies you have to move on because you will love again, you have to."
