Ask them candidly to try to moderate their voice when they’re upset, and follow up if they fail to do it. 

Raised voices is a trigger for me too. I’m only now getting comfortable asking people to please lower their voices. But family can be really hard—I could still never say something like the above to my mom, the original offender. I’m almost 30 and I still jump when I hear her scream at her dog :("

With compliments specifically, the way I see it, when your upbringing teaches you that you aren’t worthy or valuable, accepting a compliment feels wrong, maybe even like lying. I have to fight off the urge to say “no I’m not” or interpret it as insincere when I receive a compliment.

I can relate a lot—my partner and I struggle to keep our living space clean, and there’s been a history of tension between us over how we share that burden. And like you, I end up shouldering the bulk of the cleaning because I care more or I cave first.

I love him, I’m grateful that he feeds me, and I can live with him being more of a slob than me. Hiring a cleaning service would be a good fix if your problem was the mess, but it’s not, the problem is him not helping you when you tell him you NEED him to. That’s selfish and unfair to you.

You’re dealing with a disease that causes intense suffering and distorts your perspective on that suffering and basically everything else. It’s a gargantuan struggle. But as I’m sure you know intellectually (knowing vs believing can be hard), it will get better. 

I have chronic depression. In my experience, in the moment when you’re feeling so low, usually the best thing you can do is make it to the next day and try to do one tiny thing that’s good for yourself. Listen to a playlist you used to love, take a bath (less energy-intensive than a shower), go for a walk around the block, write for a bit in your journal and reflect on how you’re feeling. On days that you feel better, try to do a little more—wash the dishes, call a friend, fix a simple meal. Don’t feel bad about whatever your capacity is day to day and don’t feel like you need to apologize to anyone for it. It’s absolutely brutal, but the only way out is through. 

For what it’s worth, the only thing that has actually worked for me in managing, rather than just surviving, my depression is investing in self-care and the preventative stuff. I’m medicated and normally see a therapist, and I know eating and sleeping enough can go a long way when things start to get hard. Personally, forcing myself to go through the motions helps a lot on a day to day basis, but it can also be really taxing.

CPTSD,fcjbe7t,t1_fcj8uw6,1577682081.0,Wow what a coincidence! I’m sorry to hear you have to deal with it too. I have a lot of guilt about getting to be the “well daughter” but that’s it’s own can of worms. We DO got this!
CPTSD,fcj3tbq,t1_fcj1cjr,1577676576.0,Haha I’m with you! I’ll eat gummy vitamins every morning and it will be an easy win.
UnresolvedMysteries,fcj2gee,t1_fci265q,1577675616.0,I am so hung up on that detail. I love weed and I love my fat cat and I couldn’t spend that much on those things if I tried!
CPTSD,fcj0sth,t1_fciz25q,1577674450.0,"I completely understand that fear, but I promise you it isn’t true. Growing up with narcs can make you feel broken and unworthy, but you aren’t. If it’s any help, when I’m overwhelmed by feelings that I’m broken, unloveable, etc., I try to focus on healing (writing, reading old journals, sitting quietly with tea and thoughts about my childhood) because it redirects the ruminations a bit, and is also what can help ease those feelings in the long run."
TwoXChromosomes,fcive32,t3_ehey39,1577670733.0,Congratulations! I’ve had my copper IUD just about 10 years. I love it and am very sad I have to get it taken out soon.
CPTSD,fciu82i,t1_fciooyk,1577669925.0,"I agree that grey rocking can be pretty effective in these situations. Once you get roped in, you lose a lot of the control and it’s easy to recreate childhood dynamics. Creating emotional and physical distance is all you can do."
relationship_advice,fcioani,t3_ehdm7i,1577666010.0,Your boyfriend is gaslighting you and being emotionally abusive. You should absolutely leave him. You deserve to feel safe!
CPTSD,fcina5k,t3_ehcyae,1577665431.0,"My mom is very codependent with my sister and I and it makes me so, so upset. It was really bad when I was a kid because she would talk to me like an adult/co-parent and it was too much for me to handle. Now, she’s intrusive, judgmental, makes us responsible for meeting her needs, is critical of our relationships with others to keep us closer to her, and with my sister she’s overly involved in medical matters and behaves as if my 25 year old sister still needs her care like a child would. 

Not sure if this helps but I’ve dealt with it by moving across the country and limiting my contact with her. The dynamic with my sister and my mom ignoring my boundaries are incredibly distressing, so I try to limit our interactions to short weekly phone calls and 2-3 visits per year of no more than a few days. Tbh I would like to limit it more lol."
CPTSD,fcil3fz,t3_ehcyco,1577664365.0,"Yeah :( I just found out I’m vitamin D deficient and it’s hard not to hope it’s the cause of everything I feel is “wrong” with me and that everything will turn around in a few months if I just take vitamins. Or I’ll wonder if a new diagnosis for my mental illness or a new medication could fix all my problems and make me “like other people.”

It makes me so sad because intellectually I know I’m pretty great and not broken, but it’s a false set of beliefs I’ve held for such a long time that it’s really hard to shake."
relationship_advice,fc9vcit,t3_egubel,1577558752.0,"I was in a situation like this many years ago and it sucked.  Ended up in him “breaking things (aka periodic very drunk hookups) off” and me sobbing at my own party. 

I hope this doesn’t sound harsh, but I think if this guy we’re genuinely interested in being with you as more than a drunk make out buddy, you would know it already. Let him go and work on finding someone who will prioritize you and make you feel special whether he’s drunk or sober. You deserve it!"
relationships,fc9b53r,t1_fc99zfr,1577549947.0,Your morning ritual sounds so sweet!!
relationships,fc987yz,t3_egrxpn,1577548592.0,"That’s interesting! My partner and I have lived together for the past seven years and going to bed together is a big part of our domestic rituals. Admittedly we have always lived in expensive cities without a lot of extra money (thanks, media industry), so we’ve always shared a one bedroom/one bath apartment. I would like my own shower and maybe a big closet/dressing room, but waking up together is one of my favorite parts of the day. And we only have one cat, so someone (him) would be cat-less and lonely if we slept separately."
relationship_advice,fc8qg2e,t3_egqd1i,1577540116.0,"Trust is a choice. Your gf has given you no indication she’s cheated. If you can’t choose to trust her, it’s going to get in the way of the relationship progressing."
