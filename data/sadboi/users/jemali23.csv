lonely,fpwxxnr,t3_gfx4j8,1588971998.0,I’m experiencing the same. It’s got to be something I’m doing. I’m thinking maybe it’s for the best anyway because I don’t know how to relate to people
mentalillness,fpwvtbo,t3_gfk1kc,1588970895.0,"That feeling of depression is familiar and therefore comforting. I feel that quite often. I know I look for comfort when I’m really down and indulge destructively to find that comfort,that easing of pain, and getting numb."

SuicideWatch,fpkccmn,t3_gdt5n6,1588692091.0,I attempted suicide more than once and after each attempt landed in the emergency room. But no one at the hospital ever suggested seeking psychiatric help. I’m not sure whether it was because it wasn’t recognized or that no one cared.
bipolar2,fpkbq8d,t3_gdo3jz,1588691763.0,"I’ve been unmedicated for over two years basically because I can’t afford the prescriptions. I’m on Medicare and I can’t afford the additional insurance for medication and if I was to pay the insurance, I’d still have no money to see the doctor and obtain the medication."
lonely,fphe1hf,t3_gdheke,1588619617.0,I’m checking in now. I think that you’re surrounded by people who do care. Sometimes you have to let everyone know by crying out and you’ve done that ☺️❤️
