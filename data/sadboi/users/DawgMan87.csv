Were there dozens of recountable moments in the past that could have led to an intervention by a therapist? Absolutely. 

Frankly, with bipolar, until it’s bad enough, it’s not bad enough. If that makes sense.

It’s one of the most misdiagnosed mental illnesses because its symptoms are so similar to others.

Just google “lexapro induce......” and the first thing it auto filled is “mania”. There are a lot of anecdotal and scholarly writing on this subject. 

So lexapro didn’t cause your bipolar diagnosis, it revealed it."

bipolar,fpnir8j,t3_gehk67,1588764246.0,"Bipolar disorder can only be diagnosed by a doctor. 

Mania is just one part of bipolar disorder. 

Psychosis or the bizarre features can be caused by other things, too, like drug use. 

I’d be careful to not “drive-by diagnose” someone with a mental illness, though take the hard facts of what you’re observing and keep track of them. The fluff of the details are almost inconsequential, though facts like “he went to the police station, gave them my name instead of his, and proceeded to lie for no reason”. 

Concerning things would be like visual or aural hallucinations, uncontrolled spending, destructive behaviour that endangers themselves or others. 

Your long preface about their backstory either paints the picture that he has always been quirky, artistic, and unpredictable; which could indicate that they have had something like bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder. 

Look into the family support websites for mental illness and see if any of it makes sense. Specifically, how can you as a sibling in the same household, get your family member to realise their behaviour and seek out whether there’s nothing wrong or whether they have traits of mental illness that can be monitored and treated if affecting daily life. 

I would just keep taking notes on the big things that don’t add up. However, if the avant-garde drummer was found drumming in the street, is that really surprising?

In bipolar speak, we might call that “delusions of grandeur” or “grandiose beliefs”. Like if they said they were really good at drums and they really weren’t. Though if they’re teaching it, they might know what they’re doing. 

One of my design clients is a tribal/new experimental drum expert at the college level. Yeah, it’s weird music that not everyone is going to understand. Though they can explain it. They can write out the composition, the can describe the feeling and emotions a piece may carry. So that stuff doesn’t weird me out. 

Your brother might just be a really weird musician that is good at their niche in music academia. 

At any rate, if they are a threat to themselves or others, that’s when you get them to the emergency room or call the police.

Manic periods can lead to irrational decision making like alienating friends, family and coworkers, raiding financial resources and spending large sums and racking up debt. 

At the end of the day, you can’t make them do anything. 

If it were me, and i was manic, and stopped taking my meds, and was hallucinating; I’d want someone to take my car keys, lock up my bank cards, and help me get seen by a psych dr. 

The last doctor she saw prescribed her what they thought would work best. And it’s easily possible that it isn’t a good combination and needs tweaking. 

Many doctors are now doing Skype appointments with prescribers who they have a relationship with already to avoid coronavirus contact during office visits. 

It’s unlikely there isn’t anyone at their practice who can help. Maybe offer to help get an appointment. 

If you do get that opportunity, make it clear that they have gone off their meds for some time and now is hallucinating and behaving in a bizarre manner. 

Last case scenario would be to convince them to go to the ER. If they are so out of it and the behaviour is so bizarre, getting them to admit that there is something wrong and you need them to get checked out by a doctor to get help.
