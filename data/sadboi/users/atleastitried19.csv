BPD,fq9xaei,t1_fq9w4vq,1589208851.0,"maybe he just doesn't really know how to make a compliment so he tried to put your looks down in order to make u realise that he likes you for your personality as well? he probably didnt realise it would hurt someone like us, but idk... i dont think id be able to continue talking to him after that. maybe im being too dramatic"
BPD,fq9bseu,t3_ghadz8,1589192860.0,"i think he's being manipulative. i have exactly the same issue as you, my personality is non-existent so all my self worth is in my looks. whenever someone makes a subtle comment about me i get so depressed it's unbelievable. like the only sort of stable thing about me(my appearance) is being torn down. i feel like he is downplaying it, he was probably expecting a different answer from you so he got surprised when you were actually confident in your looks. to me it looks like he doesn't honestly want you to be with him if he said something like that, he just wanted to make sure you are not going to leave him. he wants to feel like he can rest assured that you'll be here and obviously if someone has a low self esteem and they think highly of you, they will stick around. he was expecting some self deprecating answer that would feed his ego, i guess? in my opinion you should ask what does he mean by that, why would he say that if he truly likes you,  and honestly if he doesn't really like what you look like then better stop talking/dating because it only leads to insecurities later on,and it's really not nice. you deserve someone who considers you the prettier girl in the world! and you will find, just don't stick around lowkey manipulative boys who subtly put you down just in order to feed their ego"

BPD,fq9bhqk,t3_ghb962,1589192552.0,yes! i just can't understand how can you just accept something that really hurts you? do you just fake it? i was told that radical acceptance doesn't mean conditioning your behaviour or giving up on your needs but then how do you actually learn to just accept something without doing both of those? it's so confusing and makes me realise in what a bad state i really am because i simply can't comprehend some things

BPD,fq5jelf,t1_fq4hfh0,1589107689.0,"yes that's exactly the thing about this personality disorder imo.

and saying that ""we shouldnt get bored of people who care about us"" is a bit weird. you can't choose whether or not you get bored by someone or you don't. as i said in a previous comment, i never approached people that i didnt like anything about. At first i liked some parts about them but then as i got to know them better i realised it was stupid and as soon as a ""bad"" trait showed up i would just pull myself out of it and just never talk to them again. currently i am in a relationship with an amazing guy and i love and like him so much and even if i start ""getting bored"" of him i just look at him and remind myself of all the good things that i fell in love with. even if deep down i slightly get bored, i realise it's a feeling that wont last for long and i dont let it get to the surface. basically i hide it but it's not really hiding, that's too harsh of a word. i just dont pay attention to it and act as if everything was normal, i guess you could call it auto-suggestion? and it works. also what helps me is physical bonding whether it be even just looking at him or some pics of him"

BPD,fq0ofvh,t1_fq0mvr8,1589035119.0,"exactly. been with my current bf for one year and he's pretty understanding of my splitting. i try not to split on him in that way, whenever i feel  even slightly bored of him i look at him and remind myself all the things he has that i love and like. i also had and have issues with cheating, i always seek attention from other guys as well, i don't like them, but i still feel the need to try and prove myself that i can get their validation and the worst part is at the end when i realise that i shouldn't have done that because it didn't give me the reassurance that i was seeking. in a way it makes me feel even closer to my boyfriend because i realise how good he is compared to others. kept everything at bay in my current relationship because i don't want to cheat on him in any way but it really happened a lot in my previous ones"
BPD,fq0ndgo,t1_fq0n0e2,1589034680.0,yes or ANY other trigger that i have. i usually like some parts of them in the beggining but by the end i find out more and just get out of it asap
