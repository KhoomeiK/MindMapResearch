InternalFamilySystems,fr50bcj,t3_gmn757,1589900208.0,We all have parts. We all have said at some point or another a part of me feels this way about a decision and a part of me feels another way about it. The goal of IFS is not to split those parts but to make them work with your core self energy to be better and do better so that your overall functioning is better. You are in essence unifying parts not splitting them.
AskReddit,fql1xk0,t1_fql13ws,1589443437.0,We live in a very sad world when I honestly can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not because this is exactly the kind of thing Trump supporters would defend and argue.
InternalFamilySystems,fqhpzxb,t3_giznnr,1589382069.0,"First off I'm sorry you're going through all of that. I'm glad you found the IFS model because it is amazingly helpful and a very versatile model for a number of issues. Second of all your partner is engaging in unhealthy and furthermore abusive behavior and you are ignoring some very big relationship red flags by not putting up some boundaries. It is not ok to be treated that way and it is not ok that your partner is treating you that way without accepting responsibility for his behavior and making changes. The IFS model is amazingly wonderful for helping with relationship issues as well as any emotional or mental issues but only if both parties are willing to put in the work. I do not see from your post where your partner is accepting any responsibility for their behavior and seems to be escalating and that can turn into physical violence down the road. Right now the best thing you can do is do whatever is best for your emotional, mental, and physical safety whether that means seeking the help of an IFS trained therapist or whether that means leaving the relationship or both. 

While the IFS model can be learned on your own I see seasoned therapists that have been using the model for a long time get stuck from time to time with a client's parts and need to consult with other IFS therapists to help figure out how to unburden a part so I suggest learning the technique under the wing of someone who knows the model well until you become more familiar with it because from there it is very easy to transition to doing it on your own whenever you need it. You have taken on a victim role in this relationship and it is worth exploring in the context of therapy why creating boundaries is difficult for you and why you are ignoring signs that can and have compromised your mental and emotional safety. I would also suggest reading the rest of the book because it's an amazingly good and helpful read. However, it is not intended to excuse abusive behavior by blaming it solely on a person's parts. While that is part of it, the other partner has to be willing to explore and commit to healthy and positive changes."

What you, I, and everyone has lived through on this sub is horrific and there's nothing good I can say about it. What I can say is that I hope the things and insights I have learned along the way on the healing path can be a guiding light for someone else to find their way which is why I post. I'm glad that it has helped someone. I don't have the degree to answer your question to the fullest extent that it deserves, but The Body Keeps The Score by Bessel Van Der Kolk is a great read on how traumatic experiences change and affect the body and the brain and I highly suggest giving that a read. It is by far one of the best trauma books I have ever read. I'm also sorry that your reaction to the book was so strong but the good news is that if you are aware and recognize yourself in that book you can heal it. Healing is absolutely possible and you deserve healing and happiness. I hope my other book suggestion sheds some light on your question."
rapecounseling,fojlwkh,t3_g7qcd9,1587824248.0,I'm so sorry that happened to you. What you are experiencing is not uncommon and you are not alone. Many people during their rapes had an orgasm or arousal which can lead to some arousal issues and confusing thoughts. Your body's response both during the rape and afterwards was a normal reaction to an abnormal situation and sometimes that can get the wires crossed and confuse the brain. Maybe you felt disgusted instead during your rape and not aroused and this may be your mind's way of trying to work through it. It's not uncommon for trauma victims to gravitate towards their trauma to try to give a different ending so that you have a healthier narrative than what actually happened. This is ok and therapy will get you through it all and I agree that you need a stable therapist with a history of working with sexual trauma victims. In the meantime you may find these books helpful for addressing some of your concerns. The Sexual Healing Journey by Wendy Maltz will help guide you through the sexual healing process as well as Sensate Focus in Sex Therapy by Linda Weiner and Constance Avery-Clark. IÂ also suggest The Courage To Heal by Laura Davis and Ellen Bass.
AdviceAnimals,fog87ya,t1_fog70e6,1587749200.0,A president is or should be limited by congress when they decide to hold the president accountable. This clearly isn't happening on the republican side with Trump so it becomes the job of the voters to hold their representatives accountable. Voting democrat is not just about any one policy but who decides future supreme court nominees and the overall platform. Biden's time will pass just like Trump's time will pass and then hopefully we can vote in someone who will support medicare for all and bring a more progressive platform to the table. Voting for a president is not the same as picking a spouse. You don't need someone who is perfect. You just need someone who can get the job done.

rapecounseling,foal1k7,t3_g6kdwa,1587648445.0,"I'm sorry that happened to you and you're going through that. I went through something similar with my rape 6 years ago. I had completely wiped it from my memory and I landed the best job I ever had in my life and on day 1 I started having panic attacks and feeling overwhelmed to the point of not being able to function. I didn't last 2 weeks at the job before I was forced to quit because the memories started flooding back and I felt angry and helpless like you. Like you I had also been in therapy for a long time dealing with my abusive childhood. I was diagnosed with complex ptsd not long after that which is a more severe form of ptsd caused by ongoing abusive situations instead of a one time traumatic event. My therapist told me that the younger a child is when they experience trauma the more likely that they are to repress the memories because either they didn't have the vocabulary to articulate what happened or they didn't have a safe environment to deal with it or tell anyone which seems more like the case for you. In short, what you're going through is normal and the emotions you feel are normal.

The good news is that it gets better and healing is possible. The bad news is that in order to heal you need to work through all of the emotions you suppressed about the rape. Some resources I found really helpful was the book The Courage To Heal by Laura Davis and Ellen Bass. It will walk you through all the stages of the healing process and give you guidance on what to expect and resources to help get you through. The Body Keeps The Score by Bessel Van Der Kolk is a really good book about trauma and how it affects the body. This will help you understand your aversion to sex and other triggers going on.  The Sexual Healing Journey by Wendy Maltz will help guide you through the sexual healing process as well as Sensate Focus in Sex Therapy by Linda Weiner and Constance Avery-Clark. I suggest your boyfriend read the books as well and also get the book Allies In Healing by Laura Davis as it is a book for partners. Since you also have a history of an abusive childhood I'd also get the book Divorcing A Parent by Beverly Engel. Additional resources that were very helpful for me was going to a sexual assault support group and contacting www.rainn.org. You can them at 1-866-656-HOPE or they have an online hotline you can use 24/7 to be connected with someone who can talk to you and help you work through your triggers. You deserve healing and happiness and it will get better. It just takes time."

nottheonion,fi215gq,t1_fi1urqm,1582069114.0,I shouldn't be the one defending here. You should be defending how much government interference is acceptable in your reproductive rights and health care.
nottheonion,fi1licc,t1_fi1hkkg,1582060073.0,I don't know how to make myself clearer than I already have. I don't feel the government should be able to intervene between the medical decisions between a doctor and patient. I don't believe the government should have the power to force anyone of any gender to go through a medical procedure they don't want. Childbirth and abortions are both medical procedures. I don't believe the government should have the power to dictate how many kids a person should or should not have. I believe that life starts when the babies rights start which is when the baby is out of the womb and viable so therefore the decision on what happens to the baby in the womb should belong to the parents consulting with a doctor.

nottheonion,fhzz4jx,t1_fhztcvs,1582018640.0,"Again here's where we'll agree to disagree. An abortion is a medical decision between a woman and her doctor. The government should have no say in what goes on between a woman and her doctor. The second they step in that is when it becomes authoritarian as in the bill you from the article you are commenting on. If your stance is that it's ok for the government to limit or control a woman's reproductive rights then you need to be equally ok with it when the shoe is on the other foot and men's reproductive rights are being limited by the government. The entire premise of your authoritarian argument is ridiculous because anyone can have an abortion. It isn't targeting a whole race of people like blacks and jews like you suggested. Being pro choice does not necessarily mean you like abortion. In fact, you're giving people the choice to equally choose adoption."
nottheonion,fhzm8us,t1_fhz9ezc,1582003580.0,I have already answered that. Life starts when you are viable and out of the womb. That is when your rights start by law. We don't jail women for manslaughter if they have a car accident that kills the baby while in the womb because in the eyes of the law life starts when you are both out of the womb and viable. In the eyes of the law a child in the womb has no legal rights because it is not a person. Its life has not yet started to have legal rights until it is both viable and out of the womb. You may not like it and you may not agree with it but that is the legal definition of when life starts. In the eyes of the law an abortion is not and more importantly cannot be murder because there is no life to murder because that life has not started yet. It does not matter if you or anyone feels that life starts in the womb because the law disagrees with that.
nottheonion,fhyxpwe,t1_fhyvtsv,1581986185.0,This scenario does not apply. You already asked me when a fetus has rights. I said it has rights when it is viable and out of the womb. At that point it is considered murder and not abortion.

What matters is should the government be able to tell anyone what they can and can't do with their own bodies? How far does that extend? Should the government decide what health care procedures are ok for you to have? A true conservative stance would be the one that has the least amount of interference between a person and their body. We already see with the bill you are commenting on and bills that jail women for miscarriages and stillbirths and force them to perform burials on miscarriages that the government can and will overstep their bounds if you allow them to make decisions about your health care."

The difference between what you went through and being racist is if you generalized what you've been through and said that all black people are rapists which is not what you're doing. Your trigger makes perfect sense and it's something that deserves to be discussed and acknowledged in therapy in order to help heal it.

As far as certain people triggering you you're not alone. I'm 6 years into therapy now and every morning at work I see someone who looks very similar to an uncle of mine that forced me to watch him rape a 5 year old boy when I was 5 and then he raped me afterwards. I logically understand that this man is not my uncle but I do everything in my power to avoid him while irrationally being angry and afraid of someone I've never even had a conversation with. I use my coping skills to get through that part of my day and move forward from it but I know this man did nothing wrong.

In cases of late term abortions where this scenario might be even remotely possible but highly unlikely almost all abortions are a direct result of finding out that the child has or will have some debilitating life long medical issue that will make the child suffer all throughout its life..This issue will likely need major medical attention most of the time if not 24/7 care from birth to death. If the pro life crowd fully supports financially and medically helping parents of these kids out and whatever special needs those parents may need such as access to a wheelchair van and money to make their home ADA compliant then sure but the option of adoption should also be considered. Not everyone can handle being a parent of a special needs child.
nottheonion,fhoa1ut,t1_fho9x7p,1581746958.0,No because that is no longer an issue of bodily autonomy. The child is born and out of the womb and so therefore not attached to the mother anymore. We already have laws for that.

It is not okay to force someone to go through the process of having a child to spare your personal feelings on the matter. Pregnancy comes with a potential of permanent health risks for both mother and child including and up to death and should be up to the mother to decide her own bodily autonomy.

It makes sense that you want to control things and make things better because your power has been taken away too. Finding the support you need which may include seeing your own therapist and being a supportive partner (if you can) is how you take back and take ownership of your power. The healing process that comes with being the partner of a rape victim or being a rape survivor is also a grief process of sorts because of how drastically things have changed and that you can't go back and undo it. In that sense something has been stolen from you too. However, things don't have to be bleak and hurtful forever. The healing process paves the way for love and happiness and moving forward so there is also lots of things to be hopeful for. It's going to take time though and isn't going to be easy but it can be done alone or with you mutually supporting each other. It's ok to be angry and sad about what happened.

Investing and innovating doesn't maximize profit therefore it's not a priority unless the government forces them to do it.
rapecounseling,f424vmk,t3_dj7ovz,1571327494.0,I'm sorry you've had bad experiences with therapy. There are lots of therapists that specialize in certain areas and it sounds like you didn't find the right fit. Make sure the therapist you are seeing is a trauma informed therapist that has experience working with rape and sexual assault survivors as well as ptsd. They are more likely to validate your experience and give you the tools that you need to heal and move forward from this. Healing is possible and you deserve healing and happiness.
InternalFamilySystems,f3rn79i,t3_dhwk9w,1571089678.0,The parts have different functions in the system and they all work together to make up the essence of who you are. Parts can and certainly do influence each other and can set each other off. If you experience a traumatic or upsetting event your parts may interpret it differently so it's possible for multiple parts to be blended when it comes to certain topics or situations because those parts are all holding on to different emotional baggage from the event.
secondary_survivors,f37gdhy,t3_dft1cq,1570725583.0,I am a rape survivor and I am stunned to the point of bewilderment at your post. You have some very unhealthy views towards sex and sexuality that you need to seek the help of a mental health professional for. It's disgusting and degrading to think that rape would devalue your relationship in some way and that you would leave someone you love because of it. She is a human being that deserves love and support and not an object you throw away when it starts to look less perfect. The fact that that needs explained to you just leaves me flabbergasted.
InternalFamilySystems,f361o3u,t1_f36192w,1570702986.0,If you are having trouble with the concept have you tried reading books about IFS therapy so that you get a better understanding of the concept? Have you tried drawing your parts when your therapist talks about them? My cousin had a similar problem and just noticing them and naming them and noticing when certain parts appeared helped her get more familiar with the concept and then she could move on to working with them.
InternalFamilySystems,f33d5z2,t3_dffdyx,1570636387.0,"I'm sorry that therapy doesn't seem to be working for you. I've had good success combining emdr with IFS therapy. Maybe that would be an option for you. 

I don't know what all you've tried before but you may want to ask the part you're working with to unblend and approach it with curiosity if you haven't ever tried that before. It sounds like you are approaching it from another part instead of the self and at that point you can ask that ""I don't know/care"" part to step aside or choose to work with it. The self is naturally curious and when you approach a part from self you can notice it with curiosity and you should be able to get something more from the experience. Also, ask all of your other parts to unblend as well so that you can focus on that part you're trying to work with."
secondary_survivors,f2kxliv,t3_ddnalx,1570290104.0,"I'm so sorry you both are going through this. My suggestion would be to create intimacy until he is ready for sex. See if he is comfortable with holding hands, snuggling, back massages, shoulder massages, or caressing. Touch doesn't have to lead to sex and can be incredibly intimate. 

I'm glad to hear he is seeking therapy. I know my therapist has been invaluable in helping me navigate the healing process. Your boyfriend's boundaries surrounding sex are not a personal reflection of you or how he feels about you. They're triggers brought on by the trauma. I know it's hard but respect his boundaries but try not to take his triggers as personal attacks because they're not. 

When your boyfriend is ready to tackle sexual intimacy I suggest the books The Sexual Healing Journey by Wendy Maltz and Sensate Focus In Sex Therapy by Linda Weiner and Constance Avery-Clark. I'd also get the book The Courage To Heal by Laura Davis and Ellen Bass as it will give you both a more comprehensive look at the healing process and how to navigate that.

In addition to that it would be a good idea for you to find a trauma informed therapist who has dealt with issues of rape and sexual abuse. The healing process is hard on partners and it's a good idea to have support and a safe place to vent and work through any issues that may arise during the healing process such as your self esteem taking a hit due to your boyfriend's feedback. Also finding a supportive friend or two is helpful but if you don't have anyone www.rainn.org has an anonymous online hotline you can use to talk through something or get additional resources."
rapecounseling,f27n0ys,t3_dccfkg,1570041856.0,I'm so sorry that happened to you. It does get easier but not on its own. It's best to seek the support of a trauma informed therapist who has experience in dealing with sex abuse. You can also find resources and support at www.rainn.org

secondary_survivors,f135dnm,t3_d7ng2x,1569154360.0,I'm so sorry you're going through that. It's not uncommon for victims of abuse to minimize their abuse and the effects of it and that is extending to her daughter as well.  By taking care of her father she may be trying to control the narrative of her abuse and take control of her story. She also equally may feel obligated to take care of him because he is her father in spite of the abuse. When an abuser dies or is sick it can open up a whole can of worms emotionally for someone who has not dealt with the abuse as in the case of your girlfriend. Some people feel happy and relieved when an abuser dies. Others feel intense sadness that the relationship they should have had with their parent was ruined by the abuse. I'm honestly not sure where your girlfriend is coming from. It may be worth finding out if she is willing to see a therapist trained in dealing with the effects of sex abuse. You can talked to a trained professional and find resources at www.rainn.org. You can also talk to their online hotline about how best to support her. If she is not willing to seek help and create boundaries with her abuser you need to seriously consider if this is the right relationship for you because she is absolutely putting her daughter in danger.
secondary_survivors,f0u0o6v,t3_d6l7ii,1568932156.0,It's not uncommon for molestation and rape victims to develop ptsd later on in life which sounds like what has happened to your husband. I'd head over to www.rainn.org and talk to one of their trained professionals about finding a therapist trained in sexual abuse and ptsd. I have also found the book The Courage To Heal by Laura Davis and Ellen Bass quite helpful in giving coping skills and a helpful guide to the healing process.
rapecounseling,f0rop3x,t3_d6boy5,1568889194.0,"I'm so sorry that happened to you. I found that building a supportive group of friends and family was one of the most helpful things by far next to EMDR and a trauma informed therapist. As you move through the healing process there are going to be thoughts and feelings that arise that will be difficult to handle alone and having a support system in place helps give you a safe place to talk about it when your therapist can't be there for you. Having your feelings and experiences validated *IS* part of the healing process. If those blame you or doubt your experiences it can be retraumatizing so I found it helpful to tell close family and friends rather than acquaintances.  Acquaintances are just that and they don't know you on the personal level that family and friends do and have a tendency to bail which can be just as traumatizing as the rape itself, but at the end of the day this is your healing and recovery process so you need to do what you are comfortable with. If you want to test the waters and tell someone anonymously you can call the national sexual support hotline at 1-800-656-HOPE or contact www.rainn.org to talk to a trained person on their online hotline."
secondary_survivors,f0o9dzc,t3_d5q1rd,1568802731.0,"I'm so sorry that happened. Yes, being molested or raped is a huge deal and can cause ptsd as well as a whole lot of issues surrounding relationships and intimacy. It can also cause someone to ignore red flags putting them in situations where they have a high risk of being raped again. 

It's not uncommon for victims of any type of abuse to minimize what happened especially if they reached out for help and was not believed. She may not feel safe enough or supported enough to start the healing process yet so just supporting her and respecting where she is at is what she needs at the moment. Let her know that you'll help her find a therapist to talk to if she wants and that you'll listen because there will be a time sooner or later that the mask of sanity she is wearing will crack and she will be forced to deal with her past whether on her own or kicking and screaming by the way of a mental breakdown or some other issue she won't be able to ignore. 

The best thing you can do for both you and her if you want to help is take care of yourself mentally, physically, and emotionally. The second thing you can do is to become educated about the effects of abuse. www.rainn.org has lots of information and an online hotline that you can contact to help find a support group or a trained therapist for your friend. Many of these therapists and groups are free or low cost. I'd also pick up the book The Courage To Heal by Laura Davis and Ellen Bass as well as The Body Keeps The Score by Bessel Van Der Kolk. The more informed you are the better support you can be."

survivorsofabuse,f0i2s4s,t3_d4z4rn,1568635071.0,I'm so sorry that happened to you. It is not uncommon for abuse victims to have problems with touch and it's also not uncommon for rape or molestation victims to engage in promiscuous sex. Therapy with a trauma informed therapist who has experience working with sex abuse survivors can help you overcome this. You may also try the book The Sexual Healing Journey by Wendy Maltz.
secondary_survivors,f0f1mh7,t3_d4opzd,1568576660.0,I'd start out by contacting www.rainn.org or the national sexual assault hotline at 1-800-656-HOPE and talking to them about resources as well as how to be more supportive. I'd also find some supportive people outside of the family to talk to to help you process. There's no right way for your mom to feel about her abuser's death. Some people mourn the relationship that was stolen from them by the abuse and the relationship they should have had had the abuse not occurred. Other people celebrate their abuser's death and feel relief. Some people feel nothing and there is no right or wrong way to feel about it.
AskDoctorSmeeee,f0cxpgt,t3_d4ityh,1568546702.0,There are lots of things that could cause that. Anxiety and stress can cause that and so could many other things. It would be worth going to your doctor and having them take a look because it could be a serious issue like low blood sugar or cancer but if it is anxiety related it's worth looking into therapy to help you work through and manage your stress.

secondary_survivors,f024222,t1_f01ons6,1568323045.0,You're being downvoted because it's extremely rare for children to make up something like that especially at age 11 with another sibling who has been abused in the past. All signs point to this child telling the truth in which case a victim advocate will be assigned to the child to help get her the resources and support you are concerned about. If anything children minimize abuse they have endured because they have little to no context of what normal should look like to express the extent of the abuse.
