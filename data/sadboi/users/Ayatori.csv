nba,fks8h1m,t1_fkrzalt,1584484515.0,"Depends on the team. A team built around Curry gives you the higher ceiling, but Durant fits better on most teams because he will ALWAYS be a generational player on every team, no matter his teammates, in every situation. Just give him the ball, maybe give him a screen, get out of the way, and hit the open shots you'll get on the perimeter. It's an extremely reliable offense with very little risk, and you'll have at least a top 5 offense just by doing that.

But Curry's not like that, he needs a cast built around him -- namely strong screeners, guys who have high play discipline, and shooters who can take advantage of defenses collapsing on him. But if you can actually build the proper cast - the '15-'18 Warriors were literally perfect for him - then you get a recipe for not just a top 5 offense, but a top 5 team of all time.
