BingeEatingDisorder,f4289aw,t3_dj7oi5,1571328655.0,"You are not alone. I had AN for five years, went to treatment and developed BED about a year following treatment.  A professor told me that it was literally impossible to go from being anorexic to having BED, and pretty much everyone else made me feel like a freak too.  But you are not alone at all. I think we seem underrepresented because a lot of former anorexics are too ashamed to come forward about binge eating."
bipolar,f3x4itr,t1_f3wmgzn,1571231869.0,"Hey, thanks for that. I started 150mg of Wellbutrin daily which seems to be helping. I was rapid cycling and my hypomanic activities included hyper-sexuality, getting tattooed impulsively, spending excessively, and smoking cigarettes (Iâ€™m not a smoker)."
depression,f3cc15o,t1_f3a9wpg,1570822304.0,What was your general experience with Wellbutrin? I heard it can reduce appetite and increase libido.

Yet I think about how much I want to die every day. 

Now thatâ€™s guilt."

bipolar,esp3r96,t1_esp0pd2,1562178468.0,"I got myself into many shitty situations because of my hyper sexuality before I officially got diagnosed. With meds, itâ€™s more under control, but I still get the occasional urge to have a tinder fucking spree or corner a single DILF into a grocery store bathroom. 

I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s anything wrong with being young and having casual sex. But I was doing it to escape, not because I really WANTED it. 

Now, I have a rule that I only fuck people I actually like, which seems obvious, but it was actually quite new for me. 

I mostly deal with the urges with sex toys. Theyâ€™re safe, often more satisfying, and give you a sense of control over the situation."
bipolar2,erlmftk,t3_c2m5wo,1560991111.0,Yup. I dissociate when I'm especially anxious and sometimes when I'm hypomanic.
bipolar,eos11dz,t3_bsyh19,1558816012.0,"Running has been a game-changer. Whenever I start down a ruminative spiral, I force myself to run, even if just for 30 minutes, and my mood completely lifts and stabilizes. It's honestly kind of crazy."
bipolar,eorpkm7,t3_bsnfuv,1558810738.0,"I think you're pretty on point with treating hypersexual impulses as urges that can be acted on, or neglected. My hypersexual behavior is pretty much directly linked to hypomania, which was undiagnosed for over a year. Before being diagnosed, I can see how one could (somewhat reasonably) use this as an excuse. However, once you have awareness of a destructive behavior and its origins, I think the responsibility ultimately falls on you. That's at least how I've decided to deal with it."
