Unlike you I was never particularly gifted in any way, and my intelligence was average (I was tested with an IQ of 103 at 15) But years of debilitating depression and social anxiety has really taken it's toll. Now at the age of 26, I struggle to keep up with simple conversations, struggle with reading comprehension (I used to love reading but not anymore) hell, I can't even watch a simple movie without getting confused these days. And to top it all off my memory is shot to pieces. It's as if my brain has been turned to mush and I'm seriously starting to wonder if I've become borderline mentally retarded.. It sure feels that way. And every failed interaction I have with someone only validates these fears. This all makes my social anxiety even worse as I know i'm just going to make a fool of myself if i try socializing, so why even bother?  It's a fucking vicious cycle alright.

 So yeah, i guess I just wanted you to know that you're not the only one that's going through this.. Hang in there man"
