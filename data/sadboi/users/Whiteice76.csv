Just venting.  Its very disheartening,discouraging, depressing as this continues to happen to me.

I don't know.  Maybe I am going about this the wrong way somehow.  Maybe I am putting to much in to hoping to find support, make friends with others that might understand."

I actually moved back to California a couple years ago.  Unfortunately, that doesn't stop the triggers.

I've become extremely hyper-sensitive to vibrations.  Could be from someone closing a door, or the airplane and/or helicopters sometimes flying by, or the AC kicking on.  But, anything that catches me off guard, my body is reacting immediately so I am instantly back in the event in Illinois.  The doctors, family, friends, all say that they know when it happens because I get this type of ""look"" on my face and they said they can tell that i am not there, coherent, but I am back in the event."
