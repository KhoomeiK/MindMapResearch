Amarillo is taking it more seriously but my town isn't. People travel to and from here for work all the time. Not the full effect of it but still very sad and disturbing. My friends and I are doing everything we can to stay inside our homes at least. I kid you not, a few weeks ago the mayor of Amarillo was calling all residents to gather up in a large group to pray the virus away. I've had customers come into my work place in groups and one said one time ""social distancing doesn't apply to us"" and laughed. They are so religious, and dense, it hurts and obviously has not gone well. I don't understand anymore guys. Lol"

And maybe since he used to hit you, your brain is thinking...""maybe I shouldn't disagree with this, maybe this or that "" but you know in your heart and conscious mind that it's wrong. 

 Things that show up in our dreams are our body/brain's way of trying to cope with them. I understand that you can't afford a therapist and want to try to deal with it yourself, but if these dreams become too recurrent and/or troubling, maybe at least talk to someone you trust about it. If your boyfriend is as caring and patient as it seems, try telling him. It could help a lot. I will say that you will have to deal with it mentally one way or another and it can take as long as needed. The brain likes to mess with us this way. I say that because the same thing has happened to me. 

This might sound strange, but whenever you DO have sex with your bf, if ever, those bad dreams COULD go away, or not. Since you have now created a new expectation of what sex is supposed to feel like, it could change, BUT I don't want you to use that as an excuse to make it go away :) 

I'm sorry you've had such a terrible dream about such a terrible person. You're doing well by isolating yourself from him. If at all possible I wouldn't even let him be in your presence ever again. I wish you luck. 

(Hope I don't sound too preachy or strange. Not trying to be.)"
