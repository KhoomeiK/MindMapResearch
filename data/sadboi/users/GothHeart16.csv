Also you need to understand there’s two types of self harm. One form is doing something that causes you physical pain, the other causes mental pain. There’s a huge difference and some  people don’t seem to understand that. It’s not the same. I admit both are coping mechanisms, but they accomplish it differently. You’re not getting endorphins from someone cyber bullying you. When you physically mutilate your body it’s the endorphins (usually) that you get addicted to. If nobody acknowledges this, it can be really triggering when someone compares listening to sad music with literally cutting yourself. I listen to sad music all the time and I don’t call it self harm. I also don’t use it as a coping mechanism. But would you ever say that cutting yourself intentionally isn’t self harm?

Also I’m not saying that people who bully themselves are any less valid, but there needs To be a distinction."

I agree, I don’t think it’s wrong to tear down an article like that. I guess it was honestly a misunderstanding on my part for not picking up on the fact that he mocking the article. I was therefor hasty in my private dm with him. It would’ve been nice for him to have clarified that his post was satire. I may be young and inexperienced, but it just felt wrong. And what egged me on further was In a comment he made earlier when I asked him what he hoped to accomplish he said he (not word for word) that he had something funny to share. That made me mad because at that point I didn’t actually know the meaning of satire or that it might have affected the situation. I may have also been a tad biased because I’m not proud of my scars, and people get very judgmental in public if they’re showing. But are we all agreed that the article is bullshit through and through?"
EDAnonymous,fl7vcps,t1_fl7gk1x,1584910176.0,"First, it doesn’t make a fucking difference which word you defined. Second, from the post, he was targeting girls with eating disorders and just in general being disrespectful.  That’s not my shit to deal with by your logic. I can’t prove it, but who’s to say he wasn’t trying to hurt them? But he also said HE FOUND IT FUNNY! How is that justifiable? Tell me! First he says he was being sarcastic, then he says he finds it funny. Plus, In our private chat, why didn’t he make it clear that he was being sarcastic?? Huh?? He just said “go chill and watch some anime” 

Can you seriously not see why I’m upset? You gotta be more open minded for fucks sake. Now you’re going to say that I need to be more open minded, but I’m telling you that there is a time and a place for dark humour. I myself have made those types of jokes. But only when I’m confident that that the other person will take it well. Key work “person” as an example I wouldn’t ever post a self harm joke for everyone to see, but me and my close friends sometimes reference it. The difference is that we actually know each other. The op doesn’t know any of us personally. (I am a self harmer) 

About what you said regarding triggers, thats completely true. We are responsible for ourselves, but I would hope that people have a little more decency to put a trigger warning. I’ll acknowledge that there isn’t a right or wrong answer to this, as everyone has their own opinions and neither of us is completely in the right. I’ll admit that I was a little harsh with my words in our private chat, I don’t believe I was fully in the right, I will just say it was about 3am and I was tired at the time.
