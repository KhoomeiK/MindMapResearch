JUSTNOMIL,fr69nm7,t3_gmw1rf,1589922352.0,"I don't like jumping to divorce or separation right away but I think that DH needs to stop giving his family access to your DD. They clearly have no respect for you and won't respect the way that you will raise your child. When DD gets older she will be very hurt by all your ILs do and say to her. I can tell that you don't want that for her.

If DH cannot agree having your DD go NC with his family then you will have to do what you need to in order to protect her. You also should be protecting yourself as well. If there is a record of the report with the incident with your FIL make sure to get a copy of it. You will want to document, document, and document so that you can put as much protection around you and DD as possible.

I hope that DH comes to his senses. I really do but please know that there are a lot of people out there who will respect you for protecting your daughter and yourself."
JUSTNOMIL,fr68ei9,t3_gmvkzf,1589921714.0,"Honestly, I think this is both and SO and MIL issue. If you and SO are on the same page about not having kids then he needs to make sure MIL knows that and that there is no reason to bring it up. Also, if MIL does bring it up again then you and SO need to agree on how to handle it. Personally I would just get up and walk away. Is it rude, yes, but she is being rude by trying to get a rise out of you.

Having kids is such a personal decision. It is one that needs to be treated with respect and if MIL can't give you that respect then it is up to SO to deal with it. No how much you try to say something to MIL it won't matter because in her mind SO still wants kids. SO has to let her know that he no longer wants kids and no longer wants to discuss this.

You and SO should also talk about other ways to deal with MIL. This is probably not the only thing she will put up a stink about. She seems like she is controlling and manipulative, the best way to deal with that is to make sure you both are in agreement about how to react to her ways."
JUSTNOMIL,fr662si,t1_fr5wkar,1589920550.0,"I think she is as well. It is so silly to me because she has never been able to control me, you would think she would just give up by now."
CasualConversation,fr5rbhj,t3_gmpzpt,1589913350.0,"I am only half way through this video and my goodness! You are amazing!!! You moved the furniture to clean and picked up the cushions! WOW!!!! I can't get my husband to do this. I always have to remind him to move the furniture to vacuum under it.

Amazing! Awesome work!"
JUSTNOMIL,fr5q0lf,t1_fr5ohh7,1589912723.0,"I know that my post does not give all of the context needed because I am trying to maintain some anonymity. As I said in my post, I suffer from anxiety and depression, these in combination with a high risk pregnancy are very bad. It means that, unlike with non-high risk pregnancies, I stand a greater chance of loosing my baby before it is born. I have to watch my stress levels, sugar intake, food, weight gain, much more closely than someone one else who is a non-high risk. It also means that something could happen to the baby while it still developing that would make my pregnancy non-viable.

JNMIL knows all of this because DH has explained this to her. He even explained to her why I didn't a mother's day gift. I was protecting myself and my mental health. Protecting those things also helps me to protect my baby. JNMIL was told that she was causing distress and that she needed to stop.

JNMIL refused to listen and decided to ignore DH's birthday so that she could send a gift that she wanted to send instead of acknowledging her own son. To me that is much more rude than returning a gift.

DH sent her a message letting her know the package was received and said thanks. He didn't tell her we were returning the gift. The store that the gift was returned to was the one that alerted her that the gift was returned."
JUSTNOMIL,fr5onvl,t1_fr5gpfp,1589912065.0,When you have some repeatedly message you and ask to use your posts elsewhere even after you've posted a disclaimer it makes you very cautious. Especially when you are already dealing with a boundary stomping narcissistic MIL who you thought would at least give you same respect that any human deserves.
JUSTNOMIL,fr5bfrz,t3_gmrakx,1589905777.0,"I am not sure if it is possible but do not let your MIL take care of your daughter ever again. Also, call the new doctor's office and tell them not to expect any medical records for your daughter. You are the child's mother and the MIL has no legal authority over your child.

Not sure where you are geographically but you could also send them a notarized letter (in the USA this is something that proofs you are the person you say you are although I honestly don't know how well it holds up in courts) saying that as the child's mother you will not be allowing your daughter to get treatment there.

I think you should also reach out to a lawyer. I hate to escalate this but you need some kind of family lawyer involved to make sure that MIL can't get access to your child's records."
JUSTNOMIL,fr5afxk,t3_gmoj8j,1589905298.0,"This is so like a JNMIL! She doesn't get her way and everyone has to be on her side. NC for awhile seems like the best thing to do. As for her spreading lies on social media unfortunately I have no good advice. I don't use social media so if JNMIL posts about me on there well that's too bad for me because I don't see it. I'm not saying this is the way to go, just explaining why I don't have advice.

You could ask DH to respond to her post and say: JNMIL, there is a pandemic going on and I am trying to keep my child safe, just like I would hope you would have kept me safe if you had gone through the same thing I am going through when I was a teenager. If things were different in this world right now then maybe my answer would have been different. Right now the only thing I can do as a parent is to make sure that my children are kept safe and also don't become carriers for a virus that has no cure yet.

I don't know if your DH is someone who would do that, mine probably wouldn't because he is opposed to all social media. Also that message would probably get removed, you can remove comments on the book of faces can't you? But it would at least let her friends know that y'all have your reasons for not arranging a visit."
JUSTNOMIL,fr4f7st,t1_fr483qk,1589886314.0,"She is always trying to milk thank yous for the gifts she gives. Half of which are things no one ever needs and are just junk. I seriously try to be NC with her because I can't be bothered to lie. I know lying would be easy but I just don't have the energy to deal with her narcissism, not talking is easier. This is why I have decided to just let DH deal with his parents and I deal with mine."

JUSTNOMIL,fr4eojl,t1_fr3cd30,1589885814.0,Thanks! I'm going to look into them. The pinched fingers thing is another reason I'm considering door knob protectors. We don't close many doors in our house but we will need them for the doors to the outside for sure. Plus bathrooms.
JUSTNOMIL,fr39p9c,t1_fr35zq4,1589852790.0,"Yes! LOL. Honestly I feel like we are going to have to throw half the stuff away in our tiny townhouse before the baby is born. The only saving grace is that there are a lot of other people in our development who have had kids so I know it is possible to make it work.

I'm a little worried that DH and I might have to have a talk about reducing the number of books we have. He is an avid reader and loves buying books but we are so limited in space."
JUSTNOMIL,fr399dj,t1_fr35vn0,1589852535.0,"I always send a gift receipt with my gifts. If I found out someone returned a gift I gave them I would shrug my shoulders and say, oops, guess I got the wrong thing. As I said in my post, I always give gift receipts because if I got the gift wrong then I would want the person to be able to know that it's okay to return or exchange it.

I understand what you are trying to say, I get it. But JNMIL was warned not to send baby related gifts, several times. I am high risk and I am not ready for baby related gifts. She also totally ignored her son's birthday and instead choose to stomp in the boundary we gave her."
JUSTNOMIL,fr38ucq,t3_gm9ny6,1589852292.0,"Hi OP! My good word, you do have a full blown JNMIL on your hands.

First of all, JNMIL should be happy to see any future kids whenever you and your FDH decide to go visit them. She does not get to dictate when she gets to see them.

So I will give you some background on how I handle holidays with the JNMIL and JNFIL. We alternate them. I honestly hate it but it is what is fair, and we decided to do it, it wasn't a demand that the JNos made.

Things have gotten pretty bad staying with the JNos so DH and I have agreed that the next time we go we are staying in a hotel. Honestly don't know when that will happen because I am pregnant and we do not feel like taking a new born anywhere before they reach 6 months of age. Plus the whole virus thing and the fact the JNos couldn't social distance to keep JNMIL's dad safe so I don't think they will do it to keep my baby safe. JNMIL's dad is fine, she just keeps visiting him and putting him at risk even though he is part of the high risk population for the virus."
JUSTNOMIL,fr364m0,t3_gm9k59,1589850717.0,"Ugh!!! My narc JNMIL tried to get me to call her mom. It will never ever happen. I have very strong opinions about this because I am adopted and to me my mom is my MOM. Not anyone else. I know some adopted people don't feel this way, but that is how I feel. Whenever someone asks me if I want to find ""my real mom"" I tilt my head give them a weird look. ""I don't need to find my real mom, I talk to her all the time and I visit her and my real dad several times a year.""

Sorry, about the vent.

I don't have any real advice other than to just keep calling her by her name and maybe talking to your SO about it."
JUSTNOMIL,fr33pmp,t1_fr32rxk,1589849318.0,"We actually do our gift exchange so the surprise is who got you the present. I like it that way because it is kind of fun to try to guess who got who before the presents get given out. Sometimes you know who one or two other people have but you still don't know who has you.

I do like that Santa idea. LOL, makes him the bad guy instead of mom or dad."
JUSTNOMIL,fr31gg3,t1_fr315on,1589848028.0,I'm assuming it's so that clever kids don't try to go bolting around into rooms that aren't safe for them. I personally don't understand them.
JUSTNOMIL,fr31au1,t1_fr2yr5l,1589847941.0,"To me that makes sense. Honestly, if the store hadn't notified her that the gift was returned then it wouldn't have been an issue. I have to wonder why they did that, it just seems weird. It's not like the money went back to her card, it was put in a gift card."
JUSTNOMIL,fr2z4ok,t3_gmde31,1589846707.0,"That is amazing!!!!! Super glad your DH is respecting the guidelines, it is so important. My mom and dad don't even want me to come visit them (they are like 3 hours away) because I'm pregnant and my dad has all of these underlying medical conditions.

It's sucks but I don't want be the reason that anyone gets sick. It would upset me so much. I don't even like going outside anymore."
JUSTNOMIL,fr2yli4,t1_fr2vb00,1589846408.0,"You have no idea 🙄. I spend ages trying to think of things at all different price ranges and make lists that she has damned from us, only for them to be ignored. My family does holidays differently, it's more of a gift exchange so it's so much easier since you only have to think of one thing to put on your list. It gives us time to actually enjoy time with each other too rather than just opening up presents and being exhausted at the end."
JUSTNOMIL,fr2y9x5,t1_fr2uyni,1589846232.0,"She never will be good at it. She is such a narcissist that she really can't imagine that no one wouldn't want exactly what she is giving them.

JUSTNOMIL,fr2k11k,t1_fr2j6z7,1589838648.0,He has told her several times. She just doesn't get it. I have told DH that if she asks about me just to not let me know. We've had to have a few discussions about this because normally I would give input but lately it's just too hard for me to do without getting upset. So he is slowly getting better at just not involving me. I'll probably have to remind him again because normally we are a team but oh well.
JUSTNOMIL,fr2jo4m,t1_fr2e8u4,1589838468.0,"I always include a gift receipt! I feel bad if I get someone something they already have or didn't want. My purpose for giving a gift is to bring joy. Maybe it's because my grandmother (she has passed) was such a bad gift giver and I tend to be a practical gift giver, that I know I can be way off the mark. If someone returned a gift I gave them I would never get upset.

Also, seriously, gift registries and wishlists are my favorite things! I love them! I feel like it makes my life so much easier."

I actually caught her recording the family at dinner one time, she didn't tell anyone she was recording what everyone was saying. It is just so invasive.

I have no advice, sorry. I just wanted to say that I get where you are coming from. It is troubling, especially when you aren't asked if you can be recorded."
JUSTNOMIL,fr28uc0,t1_fr27gl8,1589833136.0,"I was kind of thinking of doing that too. The only thing that would really upset me is if the pots all fell out or if they decided that the kitties need food. I can see kids doing these things. I guess maybe we will just have to get more creative about where we hide the cat food.

Plus I can totally see me getting stuck in the bathroom because of the door knobs. I would get hysterical too. It would not be good."
JUSTNOMIL,fr28ix6,t1_fr27pz9,1589832979.0,"LOL, thanks! Yeah, someone else was telling me how those socket covers are fire hazards.

I am not sure if she really needs them right now but my niece and nephew are 9 and 7 so it might make her feel better to have them."

We have very mismatched ones so it would be nice if they were all the same type so when we actually need door numb covers we can get the right ones.

I actually had to get a little heated with my mom because she was like, oh don't you want a bookshelf for holding the baby's toys. I told her no, I'm getting wall mounted cubes because they are mounted to the wall so I don't have to worry about the baby tipping them over.

I get the stocking thing totally! I'm fortunate that my family doesn't do stockings so if JNMIL wants to make one she can. Although I would rather she made face masks and wore them when she went out, but oh well."

I don't let her pick on DH or BIL, which she loves to do. Even though DH is her ""golden child"". She is so self centered that even when there is a family trauma going with her dad everyone has to check and and see how she is doing. She lashed out at DH and BIL because they weren't giving her enough attention and I replied back saying that my mom would have never talked to her kids that way when my dad was in the hospital. FYI, my family has done more than their fair share of trips to the hospital because of my dad's health.

Don't even get me started on how she is going around her immunodeficiency parents while she isn't social distancing or even wearing a mask, which she could easily make because claims to be so crafty."

So I agreed that after we got everything back from the NTP (*or something like that*) testing that we would tell his parents. Oh man, I was so not ready for it. 

If we have another kid I'm just going to do my best to keep it between DH, my therapist, and me for as long as possible. I'd feel bad for my mom but I rather avoid the guilt of knowing that I told my parents first and that DH can't tell his family until later.

Thanks for the heads up about the wall covers! I didn't know that about them. I had seen socket covers that covers both sockets, so you just open them on the side, I guess it's because of what you are saying about the plugin kind.

We have tried to call the JNMIL and JNFIL out before about not respecting us our or our wishes but they never listen. It's sad but we both have just given up. I do my best to be NC/LC with JNMIL. I let DH do whatever he wants with them but tell him to leave me and the baby out of it."

He was, and probably still is, her golden child, but she can't control him anymore. Since he and I've been together I've helped him stand up for himself and slowly am getting him out of the FOG. It's hard for both of us because my mom, while not perfect, is really wonderful so sometimes I feel guilty when things happen with JNMIL.

Anyway, she is gonna just have to deal. I've been paying my own way and doing my own thing for almost 10 years now. Even my own mom gave up trying to control me ages ago."

She tried to send us pregnancy books, which we didn't need because we had already done all of our own research. But of course why would we have done our own research. It's not like we are two grown ass adults who have been doing this adult thing for the last 5 years 🙄

She is a narc so really what else should I expect."

When we got married we put a lot of time into our gift registry. JNMIL and JNFIL decided to totally ignore it, even though they hounded us about the registry. 

I have been holding in all of the emails and texts that I want to send to JNMIL to tell her off and now I'm glad I did. That would have just played into her need for drama.

Instead I've just been making sure that DH feels okay and letting him know I'm here if he needs me."

JUSTNOMIL,fqy8d1q,t3_gllnmu,1589744346.0,"Not in your place but I will let you know that people like this rarely change. In order for real change to happen the person has to recognize the issue and want to address it. That is why therapy works for some people and not others.

It seems like MIL doesn't want to do anything unless it suits her. Some people are just that selfish and they will always be that way."
JUSTNOMIL,fqtbq46,t1_fqt7afw,1589635513.0,"Maybe try interviewing a couple of therapists before you have a session with them. That's what I did before I started therapy again this time. I also made sure not to go to a therapist that could prescribe meds. You have the right to ask a perspective therapist about how they have treated other patients in the past. If their methods sound good to you great, if not then you can move onto the next person.

I used text messages when I was in the car with my DH. My MIL had said some things to me that upset me and I explained to DH what she said and what they meant to me.

I think it will also be helpful to make sure that DH understands your PPD more. Knowing how certain things make you feel. It is important that he understands that your feelings are valid and you should be supported not belittled or told that ""they didn't mean it like that""."
JUSTNOMIL,fqt6klv,t3_gkti9d,1589631533.0,"Since you are dealing with PPD it's really important that you go to therapy. Also I hope that MIL doesn't know about your PPD, she will probably try to use that against you if she does.

Both you and your DH need to go to therapy together too because he needs to understand how to be a supportive partner while you deal with PPD.

Never let MIL be near LO unless you AND DH are with her. Before you have her around you and DH should develop a signal for when she says something nasty. That way you can let him know that she saying something nasty and he can say something to MIL.

I really hope your DH becomes more supportive, PPD is so hard!"
JUSTNOMIL,fqk7jfq,t1_fqk6qla,1589421653.0,You are welcome! I hope things go well and get better soon. Even as you all are caring for MIL make sure to take care of yourselves. It can be easy to forget that you need your own self care because of what MIL is going through but it's really important to take care of your own health so you all can take care of her.
JUSTNOMIL,fqk6cl1,t3_gjcoeo,1589421003.0,"I had a very dear friend who did this a few years ago, no coma thankfully but she did try to kill herself. FYI: We are no longer friends because she tried to ruin my wedding and just isn't a good person to be around.

Anyway, the only thing to do right now is to not blame yourself or let DH blame himself. Also, when she comes around it's best not to say how her attempt made you feel. Often times the person already feels guilty and sad, having others express their anger and fear right away can make things worse.

I think MIL needs to go into some type of rehab program, full on. I know generally these programs don't work. I liken it to therapy, they only work when you put in the work. However, the program will hopefully keep her sober for duration.

Please don't forget that you and your DH need to take care of ourselves too. Be kind to each other of the next few weeks."

The most important thing is that you and DH are on the same page and that you protect your LO. If she is surrounded by love and acceptance it will shield her from the hate of others."
JUSTNOMIL,fqk3ja0,t3_gj82b9,1589419560.0,"I feel your pain! My JNMIL is a narcissist and my DH was her golden child. He is still in the fog about her but things are getting better slowly.

The texting thing really irritates me because DH only turns the sound off on his phone if I am about to really get pissed off. Anyway, I would ask DH to turn the sound off on his phone before bed and when you all are doing something together. When I can't hear the texts it helps, I've also stopped looking at his phone because it just frustrates me. 

Strangely enough me looking at his phone kind of encouraged DH to tell me what his mom was texting. This wasn't good for either of us because I specifically told DH, if you want to communicate with your JNParents I want no part of it. Putting the boundary up has kind of been working. I don't hear about texts and DH handles his parents.

Coming out of the FOG is a long process. Even though I really never want any contact with JNMIL sometimes I feel guilty for being the one that opened DHs eyes. Then JNMIL does something awful (like ignore DHs birthday because she is mad at me) and I don't feel guilty anymore."
JUSTNOMIL,fqk17gi,t3_gj7l5v,1589418412.0,"Hi OP! I feel like we aren't getting the full story, maybe because you were rushed or you were trying to preserve anonymity.

I understand both things. I've had similar situations when I've posted on here.

If you've not already talked to DH about it then I would ask him if he cares about the clothes buying thing. Especially if they are clothes he doesn't want or won't wear. If he doesn't want them then he needs to deal with the MIL.

Now in terms of gifts, that is unfortunately just not something any of us can control. I am not sure how long you and DH have been together but maybe they don't know you well enough to buy something nice so they go for something small? However, if they use gift giving as a way to express affection and love then they are basically brushing you aside, which sucks. It's petty, manipulative, and really something you can't do anything about. I wish I could be more helpful.

My BILs fiancé got a ton of gifts from the my JNMIL this year for x-mas, it was so obvious she was trying to buy BILs fiancé's love or affection. It didn't work though because the fiancé felt so embarrassed by all of the gifts, even JNMILs sons got fewer gifts."

JUSTNOMIL,fqfzbjd,t3_gio15x,1589334709.0,MIL is a witch and a hypocrite. Any child is a blessing. People like her are the epitome of what is wrong with the organized religion. You can't go saying that you are a good Christian or a good Catholic if you refuse to acknowledge your only grandchild because of their name.
JUSTNOMIL,fqd5qsi,t3_gi8ocm,1589280680.0,FH needs to tell FSIL that FMIL is offering your family's home for her wedding without even asking you. I don't know how FSIL but if someone told me that they didn't even ask if I could use someone's house before they offered me the venue I would be horrified and mortified. You just don't go offering houses that aren't yours for an event.
JUSTNOMIL,fqc0oti,t3_gi0cpw,1589247711.0,"Congrats on your future LO!

I don't think you are overreacting at all. As long as you and DH are on the same page about how your mom is treated then I think you can just ignore JNMIL. She clearly has no interest in her first grandchild so there is no reason to give her any information."

It aggravates me so much that people don't get this. I'm pregnant and I'm terrified that my DH is going to have to go back to work next week, even though it's only 2 days a week. As soon as he gets home he will be changing his clothes and his work clothes will go in the hamper.

Stick to your guns OP. The family doesn't see you doing the right thing but I do and I thank you for it!"
ptsd,fpxoiqg,t3_gg3i2z,1588986439.0,"Hi OP! I don't know your financial situation but if you have any type of mental health insurance I would suggest going through them if at all possible. Also some therapists may do a sliding scale for patients that don't have insurance or have a low income.

You can use this link https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists and then use filters to find the type of therapist you are looking for. When I started looking for a therapist I called five people. I did kind of feel bad about doing it this way but I wanted to find someone fast. Those who called me back I did a little info session with them and asked about their experiences with PTSD and explained my story a little bit. After that I choose who I wanted to work with and it has been great.

It is really important to interview your future therapist, you want to make sure you are going to be comfortable with them. That they will listen to you and respect you. Yes, they went to school and did all the work but you are still paying for a service. For me therapy has only ever worked when I made it work and when I felt comfortable with the person I was working with."
ptsd,fpxnllj,t3_gg3j1z,1588985947.0,"I find self talk helps sometimes, not all the time though.

For example if I know I'm going past some place that may trigger me I tell myself, I am going to be okay. It will just be for a minute and I am in control. Then as I go by the place I keep telling myself that I am in control.

It honestly only works though if I have enough time to prepare."
ptsd,fpxn4kl,t3_gg3t3k,1588985696.0,"Please be kind to yourself OP! Loosing a pet is awful. My SO and I had to put our kitty down a few weeks ago and I can't look at her paw print without my SO around because I just start ugly crying and can't calm myself down. Our kitty was very sick and it was her time but I still feel awful about it. I even saw our current kitty shaking in her sleep and freaked out because I thought there might be something wrong with her.

PTSD can trigger many different things in all of us. Especially right now with all of the uncertainty going on in the world.

If you feel like you are able to I really do encourage therapy. I have been through a lot these last two years and I honestly don't think I could have done any of it without my therapist helping me and giving me tools so that I can cope."
raisedbynarcissists,fpxmg0k,t3_gg5ba0,1588985336.0,"Hi OP! I've actually had a lot of luck using Psychology Today's therapy finder section. My SO's parents are both narcs but I go to therapy because I suffer from PTSD, depression, and generalized anxiety disorder.

One thing I would do when looking for your therapist is to arrange a phone call with them before agreeing to a first meeting. You want to be sure your future therapist has experience dealing with patients who have narc parents or narc significant others in the lives. It is very important because NPD is not widely understood. 

Also some therapists may try to get you to talk to the people that you are keeping out of your life for your health. You want to let the therapist know up front if this is not what you are looking for. 

I made sure to tell my therapist my full history but to also say which things I was not looking to address. Remember, you are paying for the therapy, they should let you guide how you want the session to go, especially while you are establishing a relationship with them.

I hope this helps!"

It's part of the reason my DH and I doing order takeaway anymore, we are trying to limit contact as much as possible.

Good on you for being responsible even though it is tough and can be lonely. Sorry, if that sounds condescending, I really don't mean it to be.

As for dealing with JNM I really don't know. I think maybe a card or text with a short message. But only if you want to. You shouldn't feel like you are obligated to.

I told my DH the same thing about his mom. If he wants to send her something he can but he shouldn't feel like he has to.

I hope things go okay. Please don't feel pressure to do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable."

With everything going on DH agrees with me that we will not be letting her be near the baby because she is not doing any social distancing whatsoever.

DH and BIL both got mad at her because she went to go see their grandpa but she hadn't even been wearing a mask when she is out.

I keep remind DH that the squish is going to be very vulnerable and that we will have to protect them, he understand and so far seems okay with the fact that his parents won't be able to be around until they can prove they can at least self isolate for 14 days. Even then there will be no baby snatching. I'm making everyone but DH stand 6 feet away. 🙅🏾‍♀️"

I have a niece and nephew who are mini terrors, my niece is in 4th grade. Their BM, my exJNSIL, let's them do whatever they want, never made them pick up after themselves, never makes them eat food, or anything. They are rude to guests, don't listen to any adults. Honestly I fear for the future development, but thankfully they aren't my problem.

We may not have other background on what other interactions with JNMIL and JNFIL are like. Sometimes things get left out of posts for the sake of anonymity.

I am sorry you had to go through this OP. I hope that in the future you can go LC or NC with these people. They seem like boundary stompers and JNFIL flippant reply shows this.

You wanted to celebrate with all of the kids and you there. For a 3 year old it wouldn't have mattered if they were a few days late.

Instead of respecting you and your husband's wishes they went ahead and did exactly what you asked them not to. It shows they clearly don't respect you as people or as parents and that their wants and needs come before yours.

If maybe they had decided to call and say, oh LO is acting so sad because no one is saying anything about their bday then maybe it would have been different. Although really, I would be suspect of that too because a 3 yr old really doesn't know time or days or the week yet. Especially because you said LO doesn't understand dates yet. As the LOs parent I believe you know what your LO can and cannot comprehend."

JUSTNOMIL,fppeln0,t3_ger5y7,1588800865.0,"Hi OP! Congratulations on your baby! This is such an exciting time.

I'm pregnant with my JNMIL's first grandchild, it has been an emotional roller coaster ever since we told her that we are expecting.

Anyway, I agree with everyone else, no means no.

This is your wife's and your child. You make the rules. Trust me I get guilt trips. The thing to remember about guilt trips is that they are a form of control and they stop working on you when you don't let them.

Her: Well I wanted to do a gender reveal party but OP said no.

You: *shrug* then change the topic

I had to the same thing with my MIL because she wanted us to fly to her state an extra time last year so we could have a wedding shower with a bunch of people we didn't know. She brought it up two times and both times my husband or I redirected the conversation. She eventually stopped bringing it up because she saw it wasn't getting her any kind of sympathy from us.

Of course you know your mom the best so this might not work for you but it is the best advice I have.

We've had to turn down multiple attempts from JNMIL to throw unwanted gifts at us. She cries and whines all the time but we just ignore her and then keep her on an info diet.

The most important advice I have is to stick to your guns and present an united front with your wife."
JUSTNOMIL,folzv8a,t3_g86gvp,1587874551.0,"First of all let me offer cautious congratulations. I totally get where you are coming from in this early period because it is very scary.

When DH and I found out I was pregnant I was very cautious as well, still am at 20 weeks. I sat down and explained why I wanted to be cautious about telling people.

It is important for your pregnancy that you be able to control when you want to tell people. We waited until we got back all of the tests that were done and even then waited a little bit longer.

I hope that if you explain to your DH why you want to tell people in a certain order and how it will be less stressful for you that he will understand.

I knew my JNMIL was not going to be able to keep the secret as soon as we told her and we were basically bullied into having to tell the immediate family so that we could share our news before she shared it.
