Can anyone shed light on what kind of turnaround I can expect for finding a single family detached for move-in around that time? I.e., is it going to be possible to secure a lease a month or more in advance, or will I have to go out like two weeks prior and hope I find something?

Thanks!

P.S. -- in case you are renting out for move-in around that time -- looking for fenced yard, small dogs allowed, single-family in or near Lakewood."
