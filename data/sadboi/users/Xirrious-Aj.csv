The guy goes into deep symbolism and seems to make some sense but then,  he kind of goes off the rails a bit and suggests that mankind needs to build a space ship to fly into a hole in the sun at a certain time to reach other planets. 

I mean,  who knows?  But what the hell even speculate for? 

The symbols are basically all alchemical and describe the Cosmos and the human Soul at the same time,  all of existence and it's principles and energies,  how they relate and how they came about,  is all told in these ancient stories and symbols.

So,  if one day we combined science with esoteric wisdom,  we could have a culture like the ones that built the pyramids or other megaliths that we currently are clueless about really.

If you read my posts you'll see I'm pretty down to earth... 

I was just saying,  there is some solid scientific theory behind this and efforts being made to directly measure it. 

It has to do with the precession of the earth's axis not being a very good explanation for the astronomical observations we have.

A more accurate model has been produced that explains it with a binary (maybe more) star system,  basically our Sun and Sirius orbiting eachother. 

This is a highly logical solution,  and we will one day know for sure.  For now we work with the best math available.

It's esoteric significance on the other hand is more subjective,  but suffice to say another Sun coming closer to earth would have some dramatic electromagnetic influence...

There is a story that we were all telepathic before the last big extinction event,  the few that survived were traumatized to the point of losing their talents for it. Some druidic order preserved some elements of it in our first languages.

Also yes I have experienced these things,  in fact I use it to my advantage and send people energy and thoughts on a regular basis.  Pretty wild how well it works,  actually.

I'm mapping the effects of as well as my responses to all 8 forces mentioned here (healthy vs unhealthy, masculine vs feminine, parent vs child). Once I can do this, I can respond to anyone about anything. Human behavior is not actually all that complex. I'm pretty sure this covers the majority of it. I'm still generally in the spoken realm of it, but I imagine I will expand this stuff to behaviors once I prove the model. Behaviors are generally the most expensive implementation



I get that,  however these parameters are ultimately arbitrary. 

When your consciousness gains more elevations these parameters will lose their significance, and the developed map will become less useful. 

The only solution to understanding archetypal energy is to find it within yourself.

This post is centered around finding it externally. Nothing wrong with that,  but it does show that you do not yet have a universal grasp on these concepts, 
>I'm talking about masculine and feminine as they pertain to people. There are definitely unhealthy and excessive expressions of both forces. I probably could have changed the title so that it was more human themed, though.

There are no unhealthy expressions of these forces,  there is unhealthy expression *through* these forces,  but not of them.  

If you see it otherwise you're not really observing true masculine of feminine energy in its pure essence, but a sort of distortion that is refracted off crystallized emotional beliefs built into your energetic (psychological)  structure.

Again,  neither good or bad really in the big picture."
awakenedliving,fqbyqmj,t1_fqbxxog,1589246577.0,"To me it seems to be skewed towards the material and emotional,  versus say the ephemeral or eternal. 

This I'd say is perfect for the nature of the sub,  but without really feeling and experiencing internally the archetypes it's hard to draw clean and accurate conclusions as to where their individual influences are showing up. 

The main reason I see for wanting the basest understanding first and work up (out) is to get a feel and be able to manage the energy as close to the source of universal consciousness as possible.

Feminine or masculine natures themselves,for instance, aren't malignant in any way,  so to use those sort of qualifiers as descriptions of universal masculine or feminine is an ""untrue"" distortion. 

It also reflects a bit of your current world view to me too,  which I won't venture a comment on.

Just giving my thoughts btw, I don't see this as a negative or positive thing either way here."
awakenedliving,fqbxssc,t3_ghuuk8,1589246044.0,"I agree with a lot of this,  but don't think that you've really described the true nature of either masculine or feminine, rather just a rather dark refraction of them. 

Masculine is push,  willpower, heat,  drive.

Feminine is pull,  creative, subconscious,  dark,  mysterious

So you've got the traits pretty accurate, but I don't agree with the total assessment,  it is like its skewed too far for me to agree with entirely. 

These energies can't be described very well in words that rely on literal interpretation.  The nature of symbolism is a deeply feminine quality but one that is critical for truly groking and relaying a true representation,  even if that representation cannot be interpreted by a majority.

Just offering my two cents because ive investigated these energies in different forms quite a bit and it's a tough subject."

That shape is what most people learn first. 

An E minor barre chord fits perfectly underneath of this right in the 12th fret.  The shape outlines the chord,  so any time you play an eminor shape barre  chord,  that pentatonic shape will be available to play over it, whichever key you're in.  Or vice versa. 

There are chords for each of the positions of the major and minor scales,  this is just an example to get you started.

It may help to learn the CAGED system too,  this will link 5 chord shapes together across the neck and allow you to find the chords beneath the pentatonic shapes easier as well

Right above that E barre chord is a D chord shape that will fit in the next position of the scale. 

Hope this helps,  I'm still learning this stuff too,  it's a lot so just take your time and have fun with it!"
guitarlessons,fpgf68l,t3_gdbl8b,1588601463.0,"I learned e minor pentatonic first. I think a ton of people do.  I'm self taught so it's difficult but possible. 

Learn all 5 shapes,  which chords they go over,  and then get used to moving around in one key. 

Then,  you move the *entire* pattern up or down to change keys,  still the same relationship between notes. 

Same shapes,  different starting points, different roots. 

Also,  major and minor is the same way,  all the same relationships between notes with different starting points for the root note.

It's important to know where your roots are In The position you're playing,  otherwise you'll get stuck pretty fast.

So learn one key first,  very well,  then the others will be much easier. 

Also look for patterns within the scale itself,  the major and minor scales and modes are all variations of 3 patterns,  which repeat over and over up the neck. 

If you know where the notes are on 2 strings,  you can find the rest of the notes by following this pattern. Rick graham did a good video on that on YouTube"

Cool for.. lighting candles or,   crashing computers I guess."

 You know on second thought,  this idea probably isn't good to share with a huge group of people since it's so likely to be taken the wrong way."
Soulnexus,fpd5bk3,t1_fpd46sg,1588520151.0,">There are processes and patterns here that will continue regardless of how we may subjectively interpret them. 

So I agree here with you. 

But,  I also view reality a most basically a phenomenon of resonance.  And all under the archetype of the cosmic Mind. 

So this here could be viewed as simply another limitation to overcome. 

The density is a thick resonance in the fabric of space-time.  But still able to be bent.

I like the open endedness of this because it doesn't limit us at any point either way up or down the line.  It's obviously a philosophical point of view rather than a wholly practical one, for I am not able to teleport at this time lol,  or bi locate,  etc.  But,  these things are also possible to anyone who works to raise their consciousness to that level. 

And beyond that,  we become creator of Worlds as logic would imply. 

So yeah,  I do agree with you and can stand with equal footing on your statements,  but I also wanted to elucidate a bit of my thinking behind this particular idea."
