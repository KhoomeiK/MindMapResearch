Lots of guys strung along, being cutesy/hipster/twee (it‚Äôs been my authentic esthetic and still is to an extent)

Adhd/trying to cover up whatever it was that was innately ‚Äúwrong‚Äù about me Combined with a strong social media/blogger ‚Äúinfluencer‚Äù (2008ish lol), being performative and seeking outside validation was how I survived. 

I left the small city where I was a big fish and moved out where I knew no one and suddenly didn‚Äôt matter that much anymore.

I've been working to discover and unpack/undo the 30 years of survival skills and internalized self-loathing that's been driving my actions, habits, and internal thoughts. It's hard work but really rewarding when I can put the things I've learned into practice.   


Since isolation, I've started doing self-compassion meditation audio/videos on YouTube, and it's been a game-changer. Helping me accept myself - that I'm not a bad person who is a fuckup, but a normal person who makes mistakes sometimes, and deserves to be loved just as I am.
