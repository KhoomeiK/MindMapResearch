AskVegans,faoz62u,t3_eaaesg,1576275957.0,"I am a huge fan of campaigning against fast fashion. I almost strictly thrift, and i ask family members friends etc to buy from thrift stores or sustainable brands if they want to buy for me. I also use reusable eco friendly kitchen stuff like bees wax paper instead of Saran Wrap. I also only buy cruelty free makeup and cosmetics, as well as shampoo/conditioner etc(which also often happens to be sustainable).  I also drive a Tesla , and my family is working towards installing green, energy efficient tech into our home over the next 8 years. There are sooo many ways you can reduce your negative impact on the planet alongside veganism, I think veganism just really opens people up to them."
