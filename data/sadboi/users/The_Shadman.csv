For example, I have battleships with hangars, and battleships without hangars (tbh, I largely put in the hangars for visuals sake but they're quite useful for mine destruction when they get in the way).

The big thing for Battleships is to always use the X-tier weaponry. Tbh, Mega Cannons and Tachyon Lances are the best; they've got range and can deal devastating damage.
For destroyers and cruisers, *point defense is very important*. Flak artillery or Guardian Point Defense are mega useful.

As for the corvettes? Just use phase disruptors... your enemies will lose shielding *very fast*. The AI tends to be a shield junkie. Sure, the little corvettes are usually the first ones to get shot down, but the damage dealt is useful...
Overall, I'm a point defense, plasma cannon, and kinetic artillery junkie.

Those, along with Tachyon Lances and Mega Cannons, seal the deal in combat.

Also, my admirals are cybernetic and synthetic in a materialist, egalitarian, militarist empire. So yeah, have an edge in fire rate over the AI is a big help."

Stellaris,fn1fe43,t3_fwn3r0,1586560867.0,"This is going to sound incredibly cheesy, like very cheesy. 

In this game (well, console version), I've been giving a visual of the difference between having a tyrannical government and having a more egalitarian, tolerant government. 

For example, I once conquered most of the galaxy as a Despotic Hegemony. My empire had been fighting a Federation of democracies allied to bring down my expanding imperium and won each and every conflict. As I continually expanded, I began to wonder ""Why does the galaxy still hate me? Shouldn't they just be more docile right now?"" I seriously asked myself this question because each and every pop had full citizenship, regardless of race, and even *synthetics* had full Imperial rights.

Then, I had an epiphany.

My empire was actually an Orwellian police state that maintained order through a meager social welfare system and an absolutely *massive* military; each and every planet was filled to brim with armies as a means of discouraging any form of protest and unrest. Furthermore, my empire was governed by a group of aristocrats who came from elite ""Party"" status instead of the hardworking general masses. Even though slavery was illegal on paper, the very nature of the empire effectively rendered each and every pop a slave to the state. Moreover, my empire went out of its way to tear down spiritualist temples so the masses could not flock away from the materialist ethos of their Imperial overlords. This worked well enough so as to completely smother religion. And when the pops rebel? The empire would activate chemical bliss, making certain races less productive, but happy and more likely to comply with Imperial ethics. In fact, the Empire used Chemical Bliss so frequently that ***withdrawal symptoms trigger whenever it so much as tried to alter citizen's rights.***

So... the final result?

A seemingly all-powerful, ideologically homogenous empire with total control over most of the galaxy... a control that's very fragile, for unhappiness and unrest are present on each and every planet. 

The Empire spent most of its history and resources in the repression of the masses.

At that moment, I realized that the Solarian Empire was more malicious than the Fanatic Purifiers or even the Scourge. It's future... is not bright. I honestly believe that one day, in spite of the tolerance that the citizens have for the Empire's nonsense, they will have that *one* monarch that pushes them over the edge, their equivalent of Louis XVI or Louis XIV, and when that day comes... Solaria would implode and take the galaxy along with it. 

As for its polar opposite... it is a less dark story.

As I played the role of an egalitarian society, I found that... expansion was rather easy; due to Utopian Abundance being assigned to each and *every* pop, the people were largely happy- and with happiness- came much more productivity.

The benefit of democracy came from being able to switch leaders according to the one needed by the times. Unlike the totalitarian Solarian Empire, the United Solarian Republics had a leadership that could routinely alter itself; it was not bound to a single figure or family.

For this reason, the USR rose and rose very quickly. Immigration and synthetics were a boon for this republic's growth. These pops were assigned full citizenship and the same living standards as everyone else in the republic. 

This was not the only benefit... for the real money maker *came from the fact that I did not have to dump half my earnings into smothering my own citizens.* 

Unlike the Empire, the USR left spiritualist temples and faction period alone; the spiritualists could practice their faith without government persecution. Moreover, if any faction wanted to partake in government, they very well could. Likewise, chemical bliss was never utilized on any pop within the republic's borders.

This was great for resources.

 I could spend all those minerals and energy credits into the construction of megastructures, habitats, science, and a military made to *defend* the republic and its interests abroad.

To conclude this very, very, very long post, being egalitarian materialist rocks."

depression,fhzij3m,t3_f1yg2s,1582000475.0,"I 100% relate to this statement. This is why I somewhat take issues with societal portrayals of depression; in that we like to portray as the person not being entirely alone in their struggle. Though people may provide support, their capacity to provide support has limits; the first limit is their ability to help another person. We cannot expect a neurotypical with no professional experience to be a savior figure in our lives. That's just not how it works. Some people can only tolerate so much and sometimes people can only *do* so much in the face of an illness defined by chemical imbalances in our brain and/or poor life experiences. At the end of the day, depression is basically our battle to fight, and against our own demons, we're essentially alone. 

The second reason is the nature of depression in itself. Depression is not a mood or a fad; depression is a long term illness that wires the brain into being self destructive. It's basically the illness that defines our lives and how we see it. Depression, along with anxiety, essentially perpetuates itself like a free energy machine; through self destructive behaviors, depression is able to sustain itself via the emergence of new forms of negative emotions or emotional numbness.

I know you may think that this is just me rambling and shit like that. And I also want you to know that if you are thinking that, you are totally right. However, in my opinion, I feel like depression is an individual battle with problems, mistakes, and personal demons. For this reason, nobody can fight our battles for us. There is no ""savior"" figure that will come and solve the problem of depression. That boyfriend, girlfriend, or even close friend we wanted... we may get that person, but they won't be that ""savior"" figure, for depression will still exist and keep going strong.

So... no other person can save us, right? Does that mean we're hopeless?

The answer is... no. That doesn't mean we're hopeless in this war at all.

*We can be our own saviors.*
We score small victories all the time, be it getting up in the morning, eating breakfast, going to work, going to class, doing the things we like even for the tiniest bit, or just remaining alive. Though these things are small, history shows that plenty of small victories go a long way into winning a war. So the little things we do everyday? *They are signs of strength.* They are signs that we still have fight left in us. They are signs that we can still move forward. They are signs of a better tomorrow, of hope.

So let's keep fighting the good fight, and hope that we win."

needforspeed,ex3rju3,t3_cr3mu1,1565990175.0,"Here's my breakdown of the trailers;

Heat has a feel of a Need for Speed game; cop chases, street races, and even races in the style of ProStreet. It's high octane, feels crazy, and it feels NFS.

NFS 2015 feels more like NFS Underground and a somewhat more toned down interpretation of street racers (They race for the lulz). However, cop chases are present and the trailer feels like Underground, so its NFS.

Payback's trailer feels like the Fast and the Furious, which is different from the traditional tone that Need for Speed games have. The game is trying to highlight the conflict between the protagonistic crew and a mafia group, while largely neglecting the role that the police play in the story (I know the cops barely matter in Payback). The acting is also less emotional in comparison to the dire situation that Tyler and his crew were presented to be in during the trailer. Therefore, Payback's trailer was a bit different.

In my opinion, anyone that says Heat is a Need for Speed Payback 2 is reaching; as I inferred from the trailers, Heat has an intense tone in contrast to Payback's more laid back tone. 

Hence, I don't believe we have anything to worry about NFS Heat's being similar to Payback beyond the game engine."
