TheCannaSchool,fqeyv1f,t3_gi9x4z,1589315876.0,"I've only had the fortune of working at one legal dispensary in Caliornia but my experience was thus: it was in our contract that we signed when we began employment with the company that we had to follow regular workplace policies in regards to working while intoxicated as well as a strict policy against smoking on site.

So, for the former, coming to work high was, on paper, something you shouldn't do. This made it hard for some of the old school trimmers who had been doing that work for years and sometimes decades to adjust because they were used to a different work environment, which was more lax, meaning they could smoke and trim at the same time. As a more professional setting, it wasn't encouraged or allowed at all. Did people come in high? Sure. If it didn't impede their work, no one cared. However, this didn't always apply to the budtenders because they are the face of the company and held to different standards. Some staff were let go for coming in high and unable to function in a professional capacity.

Now, for the people who smoked on site and were seen on camera (which were legally mandated to be located throughout the business) they would be written up or put on restriction. The reason I was told for the harsh consequences for that infraction was because it put the businesses' license in jeopardy. Of course staff would get together after work and hang out, smoke, drink, what have you. What was conducted after hours and off site wasn't an issue.

This was just my experience. The dispensary I worked at was very high end and we tried to maintain a standard among the staff but I mean, I don't think anyone ever got drug tested or anything. Background checks were required as part of the hiring process. But I know from the managers that they didn't discriminate against you if you had a nonviolent drug charge on your record. Most of the staff smoked regularly, or used medicinally, or had family that used medicinally or recreationally. It was part of the culture of passionate care that we had, many people spent tremendous time doing their work to educate themselves on the newest data on cannabis, or were incredibly passionate about how they cultivated the plants themselves. I can't say much for other businesses, but I know that at least in California, background checks are required, there might be legalese in the contract you sign about workplace intoxication, but it's all reliant on the work environment the actual staff work on. The more protections the business has against any risks for their employees, clients, and business model, the better leg it has to stand on to avoid getting shut down. If you're looking for working legally, ask a lot of questions about the place you want to work for. Research if you need paperwork or permits to work legally (Oregon I believe requires a worker's permit for cannabis). Go in and get a sense of how the staff behaves. Maybe ask them how they like it.

Edit: TL;DR it depends on how ""legal"" the business is and how strictly they adhere to state and local policies and regulations."

There are some grounding techniques for some types of depersonalization that can be triggered by cannabis use, but they're basically bandaids on a gaping wound. The best method is to practice strong self care such as therapy, plenty of regular sleep and exercise, and self soothing methods like taking a warm shower, going for a walk, or paying attention to symptoms and acknowledging them as temporary and unharmful. Definitely talk to a cannabis friendly doctor, and begin therapy for a good handle on building a toolbox of coping mechanisms should side effects occur."

I want to tell you there is a sure fire way to cure what you are going through, but there really isn't enough research on the long term effects of cannabis on some individuals like yourself. Some ways that I've found to be helpful are grounding techniques [such as in this article](https://californiahighlandsvistas.com/marijuana/depersonalization/) or [this one](https://www.dpmanual.com/articles/drug-induced-depersonalization/). Another thing you might try is purchasing a container of black pepper and sniffing it. The terpenes in pepper are similar to terpenes found in some cannabis but can help ease the sensation of being high. Unfortunately, you might also have to stop smoking all together until you receive psychiatric assistance. It sucks and I'm sorry you have to, but it would be better for your long term mental health. Remember, this experience is temporary and you are safe. Best of luck!!"

Marijuana,flpz3ki,t3_fqcmil,1585373218.0,"You could be one of the lucky people who just don't respond to edibles. Or those edibles could have been improperly dosed. It's hard to say, really, because there are so many factors that go into edibles. They take a while to kick in because they have to go through the liver first, and then if you ingest CBD, you might have even more trouble getting high using edibles. 

In California before legalization when it was medicinal, we used to have these chocolate bars that claimed to be 420mg of THC. I have a friend who's smoked since the '60s who swore by them. I also have another friend who used to pound those things down and claim to not feel a thing. Everyone is different, there's so many different possibilities. Now that recreational has succeeded in California, I've noticed the dosing has gotten slightly better. I had a tester of Kushy Punch hybrid gummies that were 10mg each teeny tiny square, ate 2, was so high I couldn't see straight, and on top of which I had horrible heartburn. 

TL;DR there's too many different variables to be sure because there's very little in the way of proper dosing, every individual's reaction can be different, and sometimes they just don't work."
Marijuana,flpvopk,t3_fqd9e5,1585370176.0,"Depends on how recently you smoked the CBD carts. CBD tends to ""dampen"" the effects of THC [because they counteract each other.](https://www.leafly.com/news/cbd/cbd-vs-thc-cbd-not-intoxicating) If you haven't smoked that day and drink the soda, drink half which will hopefully be about approximately 5mg, wait 30 minutes to an hour, and if the desired effect isn't reached drink the other half. It also has to do with what you've eaten that day, your mentality, overall health, metabolism, and a bazillion other factors. How one affects one person doesn't necessarily mean how it will affect someone else. Smoked THC hits the system faster because it goes to the [bloodstream through the lungs](https://www.leafly.com/news/health/considerations-before-ingesting-edibles) while edibles take time because they have to go through the liver to be metabolized.

QueerWomenOfColor,fifa9tw,t1_fien8ix,1582387614.0,"I appreciate your post a lot too because colorism needs to be talked about and addressed especially for Latinas because our lives aren't in bubbles you know? I was on Tinder trying to talk to mujeres and I realized I didn't want to fetishize or tokenize them especially because of my skincolor and lived experiences. If you were to give advice for mujeres/nb folx who want to do better and be better lovers, friends, and comrades for AfroLatinas what would you suggest? And thank you, you as well!!"
CPTSDmemes,fic74v4,t3_f7jif6,1582339273.0,I wish I was an empath but I'm just traumatized and conditioned to be as accomodating as possible to avoid conflict :/
QueerWomenOfColor,fic5c59,t3_f7je8d,1582338004.0,"I'm Xicanx (agender lesbian) and don't speak Spanish well AT ALL. I'm learning a little more every day but I try not to subject anyone to my bad Spanish lol :/ Everyone I've dated has been either white or white coded but mostly trans women. I know I have a lot of internalized racism and antiblackness to work thru so I'm taking my time being single because I don't want to date gueras for the rest of my life. I would date you in a heartbeat!! But I gotta work on myself first, so I can be a better friend and lover for las mujeres."

Every time I'm struggling and my friends say they're going to call the cops for a wellness check I remind them of him. Rest in power, Kelly Thomas."

CPTSD,fi9fnai,t3_f72786,1582264251.0,"Did I write this? Because I think I wrote this. I am totally in your shoes and I finished undergrad several years ago. Still living at home, home is major source of my cptsd, cptsd is why I won't leave home, oh and I got laid off in October and I'm super depressed and can't find a job and won't settle for anything less than minimum wage because I need a job that'll help me. move out but that severely limits my options. Every day is just struggle and anxiety. I even started smoking again even though I barely make any money doing postmates and I had quit for three years!!! Anyway sorry for going off on your post. You're not alone."
