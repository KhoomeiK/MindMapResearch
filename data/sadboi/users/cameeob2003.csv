NewSkaters,fr133uj,t3_glnwyp,1589812319.0,Like the others said its weight/foot placement but also it looks like your not committing. Gotta commit. Both feet on the board and you got it. Dont fear falling!
NewSkaters,fr12ggk,t3_glcvr8,1589811951.0,Deff clean af. Awesome work.
NewSkaters,fr081i4,t3_gljss5,1589786611.0,Try bringing your front foot back further on your board and speed up the drag a bit. I find this helps me get the air i need to get over decent sized stuff like 2 board stacks and stuff.
NewSkaters,fqear85,t1_fqe9ij8,1589304498.0,"I gotta agree with this statement. In my opinion skating is more of a personal journey. The truth is no one cares if you ""good"" at skating, the thought they do is in your head. They will hardly notice the mistakes you make and if you take a good slam dont fret it, slaming the pavement is a part of the journey and most people will just ask if your ok. Dont let other people hold you back. Put your headphones in  and skate!"
youtubegaming,fqaphni,t3_gg780g,1589223034.0,I had this same thought but i found its just the preview that wouldnt go above 360p. I went to the actual live video link and it was 1080p@60. Kinda threw me at first so possibly this is what you are experiencing.
youtubegaming,fqap8im,t3_gg9cpi,1589222911.0,Hit the live tab and you should see it
Damnthatsinteresting,fo7bvmu,t3_g5zt42,1587575695.0,That is awesome. Want that for my wallpaper in my house.
New_World_MMO,fn989aw,t1_fn96hoz,1586762945.0,Lol. Sounds good! Take care good sir.
New_World_MMO,fn939vz,t1_fn92q5d,1586757964.0,Hey I respect your opinion. Mine is just slightly different than yours. Not trying to disrespect the guys making New World at all but in my opinion there could have been better ways to let the people who pre ordered know sooner that the deadline wasnt going to be met. I've been in software for the last 10 years as an engineer and trust me we know well before 2 weeks to the due date that a project wont be done in time.
New_World_MMO,fn7buu2,t1_fn5wuqt,1586717258.0,"Nah, communication is key no matter what type of businesses you run be it a development studio or a coffee shop. Also im not upset with the delay, i understand the situation had them behind. The communication was the only factor here."
New_World_MMO,fn5p6ve,t1_fn5n20j,1586671288.0,Love the positive outlook and that is a really good way of stating how you feel about it. Gunna keep that quote in my back pocket for future use.
New_World_MMO,fn5lgh2,t1_fn5kixs,1586668114.0,Fair enough. Will take it into account on the next one!
New_World_MMO,fn5k6hm,t1_fn5f5gd,1586667093.0,I haven't been in the alpha yet but I have heard from several people that are that the game needs more content in order to be fun. Still hoping and praying on my alpha key but we will see.
New_World_MMO,fn4pxko,t1_fn4ortb,1586646446.0,The pandemic is completely understandable and I have no issue with the delay. The only thing I wish they would have done better is be more open in communication. At the end of the day the game is still in development and we all have a shot at getting into alpha. I'm not upset about the delay but the lack of transparency up until the last minute is what gets me.
New_World_MMO,fn4lsaf,t1_fn4kxwg,1586644013.0,I'm not sure why they chose that date with WoW and Cyberpunk being around that time. I honestly hope that the game comes out more polished and picks up traction but the other games releasing around that time makes it less likely.
New_World_MMO,fn4lmvu,t1_fn4jpg6,1586643922.0,Honestly can't blame you. I'm still on the fence about it but trying to hold out.
New_World_MMO,fn4csm9,t1_fn4cjew,1586638724.0,"I agree. There was a real lack of communication and transparency in this situation is how I see it. Like I said in the video even a simple tweet saying ""Hey guys we might have to delay the release."" would have been better than saying nothing until the last minute."
New_World_MMO,fn44tog,t1_fn4475y,1586634075.0,I feel you. I was waiting for the closed beta to drop as well and my luck with getting an  alpha key has been less than stellar. Being locked up because of COVID-19 also doesn't make the situation better in any sense.
New_World_MMO,fn44nk2,t1_fn443t3,1586633977.0,In general it has been a very negative response from the community and I feel like in some regard they have the right to be a bit salty about the delay. It was within at most 2 weeks of when the beta was going to drop. Although there are those that see it as a positive and the people who are salty are generally more vocal than those that don't mind.
startups,fk2meez,t1_fjwsjsh,1583804218.0,Why would you say that? If they are extensible activley maintained and provide the functionality why would you bother reinventing the wheel. I'm a sofware engineer as well (over 10 years in the space) but honestly curious as to your reasoning.
summonerschool,fjepdwg,t3_fcvq6m,1583276096.0,Sounds dumb but what works best for me ia saying what im about to do out loud. Makes it to where i catch myself on really stupid choices i was about to make. Also saying my thoughts in general out loud has helped me as i play. May not work for everyone but deff works for me.
SuicideWatch,fcmmb60,t3_ckuqxj,1577781348.0,"I was rsised to believe in heaven/hell and your spirit passing on but honestly im not in that thought pattern anymore. Our brains are complex and animals experience many of the same things we do (take dogs for instance). I never read about dogs (or any other animal for that matter) going to heaven. Honestly humans arent above anything else on this earth we are just different in a way that allowed us to pass on information. Reliegion isnt bad in general but when it starts messing with your well being it can be. Believe what you want but ashes to ashes dut to dust should mean something.

Either way im choosing to stick this out for the highlights of life (as few and as far inbetween as they may be). Have a few little ones so once they are out of the house well see if my general outlook on life changes. Doubtful but who knows."
skateboarding,fcc79gk,t3_eh1p2y,1577595188.0,Looks good. That park also looks like a lot of fun.
skateboarding,f3afyr9,t3_dg877i,1570771677.0,Awesome! I can only hope to be there one day.
apexlegends,et8pzx4,t1_et8no6d,1562565095.0,Just seemed faster than usual for being an alternator. This was just a brief example of it feeling OP in general. Not meant as an end all be all showing  its OP. Still feels a little weighted to me but just my opinion.
apexlegends,et8myji,t1_et8mq1m,1562561754.0,"I'm thinking the same. Still seems to melt people, but that's just me maybe."
JustBootThings,esz68y9,t3_c9by46,1562355978.0,"If they had ever been to ""war"" I can promise they wouldn't want it anymore... kids these days..."
insurgency,eqvvvy4,t1_eqv3zdt,1560350289.0,Glad to hear!
JustBootThings,eope7ql,t1_eonxvop,1558761650.0,"A good number of private security personnel come from a military background, have passed all qualifications and are honestly overqualified for the job. Like was already said they do it because it pays way better than the military ever will."
