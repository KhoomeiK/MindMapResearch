The challenge is finding the right mentor that can help you develop, in this case, someone who can help you get more comfortable in your role and remain productive. If you are being assigned new responsibilities, you're within your rights to ask for that. You could also network with a local professional group and find a mentor there. Or trawl LinkedIn an cold email people that might be a fit (even better if you can have a mutual connection make the introduction). Good luck!"
