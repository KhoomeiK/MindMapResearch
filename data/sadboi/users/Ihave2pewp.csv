For now, can you just try to ignore her and not let her get to you, as best you can? I know that's hard. And surround yourself with people who make you happy (or at least staying in touch with those people over messaging). Being around toxic people is very draining"

Its so interesting how we all physically store emotions in our bodies. Sometimes I like to lay down and pretend I'm dead, and then I let my muscles completely relax like as if I was literally a dead body, like let your mouth open and everything.
