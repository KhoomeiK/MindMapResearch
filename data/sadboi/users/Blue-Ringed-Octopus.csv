introvert,fmjb32l,t3_fvj1xq,1586126687.0,That was me! I remember getting in trouble and  the teacher putting my desk in the back away from everyone because I would talk to anyone and everyone back in early elementary. Then middle school comes along and I’m so shy I don’t make a single friend. I wonder what happened exactly. I’m sure constantly being yelled at and scolded by my teachers didn’t help.

exmormon,fj0yjd8,t3_farinv,1582909850.0,Ooh yes! That sounds exciting. I’ve had the most amazing experiences on shrooms and they’ve helped me overcome some of the negative thinking I was taught as a member. I’d love to hear about your experience afterwards. Good luck!
shrooms,fizfuil,t3_fallb3,1582861737.0,"I was on Prozac(the generic), Wellbutrin, Seroquel and before that Trazodone. I completely stopped taking my medication for about a month before I took about 5g of mushrooms. I don’t know you or your situation but honestly I would advise against stopping those medications or at least discuss it with your doctor. I went through a hellish month before I took the shrooms and while the trip was a great experience and did help a lot with my depression and other symptoms, it didn’t make up for being off my medication. My family, friends and therapist have all noticed the changes in me and have mentioned that I was doing better before. Anyway, I’m stubborn and I just want to trip more but I know I need to get back on my medication and work on things that way until I’ve progressed more and can consider getting off my medication the right way with my doctor and therapist approval. Anywho, that’s just my experience. Everybody is different and you know yourself better than anyone. Good luck my friend! :)"

loseit,fg4tzh6,t3_ewq3lz,1580511059.0,I lose weight really easily and I’m female. I see the will power and restraint to be the most difficult part of losing weight and that’s difficult for anybody regardless of gender. I’m sorry people have discounted the hard work you’ve put in. I agree a lot of it is likely people projecting their own insecurities on you. No matter what weight loss takes a lot of work and you deserve to be proud of yourself despite what others say!!! You’re awesome!
shrooms,ffjncg8,t1_ffjk4e3,1580002237.0,"I remember my art teacher in 7th grade forbidding anyone from making any art with mushrooms in it. I had no idea why. It took me until my 20’s to understand. Lol, I was very naive. Just saying it’s definitely possible."

It was actually somewhat traumatic for me but even so I don’t regret it. Having everything paid for and getting money back made it totally worth it in my opinion. Just make sure you bring interesting books to read. I only brought one book and I finished it, so I just had to lay there for a few hours."

mentalhealth,feew1gw,t1_feetw59,1579042436.0,"Oh I don’t? I guess all that time and money spent in therapy was for nothing! So you’re telling me the psychiatrist who diagnosed me is just an idiot and you know better? You call people with mental illness crazy!?! Telling someone who’s hurting that they’re selfish is just judgmental, insensitive and unhelpful. You think people go out and commit suicide because someone tells them they’re not selfish??? What kind of logic is that. I don’t think you understand."
mentalhealth,fees82h,t1_feeqrml,1579040096.0,Where the hell did I tell anyone to end their life?!? I spent a week in a behavioral unit after a suicide attempt. As well as several other attempts. I’m very happy to still be here. Currently I’m saving up money to get my degree in nursing to specifically help people who are struggling with mental illness. I would never tell someone to end their life!!! I was arguing that it’s not selfish. Which I wholeheartedly believe. You grow up!!!
AmItheAsshole,feerfg1,t3_eopd7q,1579039611.0,"Eh, I guess you’re in the wrong but I would’ve done the exact same thing. Fuck paying hundreds or thousands for a ride to the E.R. I would’ve just wrapped it up really well so I didn’t get blood anywhere."

mentalhealth,feenp98,t1_fedmsvj,1579037447.0,"Duh, it’s the easy way out! That’s the whole point. It’s easy to say get help but in reality, our understanding and treatment of mental health is still so lacking. Many people don’t have access to proper treatment or simply can’t afford it. Not to mention there’s not really a cure for these things. Many people are resistant to medications and nothing seems to bring them relief. Get help is such a pointless thing to say. You think people don’t try? I think it’s selfish to expect someone to continue living in pain and misery. Yeah those who are left behind may struggle greatly because of it but why should someone continue living just to keep from making others sad. That’s selfish!"
Health,fecmgcw,t1_febv9s4,1578977552.0,"I completely agree. If I wasn’t able to get an abortion, I’d be flying to wherever I could get one and if not then suicide it is. Not being edgy at all it’s the complete truth."

PublicFreakout,fe44aaq,t1_fe4105h,1578855680.0,"Cool. The guy in the video is talking about war crimes being committed, innocent civilians being killed to fight our wars, meanwhile we can’t even put money to better the lives of our own people. Such as education, healthcare, etc... He’s talking about what he saw and his experience. Did you even watch the video? He’s not simply sad about some soldiers dying in war. Not even close to that. Not to mention how many people are backed into the military because they have no other choice. They can’t afford education, healthcare, they need a decent job that pays and so they go into the military out of necessity.  What about how little support our veterans get when they come home from war.  Many don’t get help for their PTSD, depression, etc... The government doesn’t care that you served.  Obviously it’s complicated but you don’t seem to even understand  the video you commented on. You’re not worth arguing with."
PublicFreakout,fe402ci,t1_fe0vz94,1578854515.0,All I’m saying is you clearly have no clue what you’re talking about and you sound very foolish.
