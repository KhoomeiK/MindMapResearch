Unless you have problems breathing, blood pressure problems, thoughts of suicide or extreme bouts of paranoia or severe heart arrhythmias or palpitations you should be OK. Dizziness, yawning, brain fog and extreme tiredness are on the “typical side effect” list.

I don’t know why I dug my heels in and argued with him and tried to make him feel foolish for his ignorance and then realized I was wrong. I had never done anything like that before, I think I felt threatened which again I think was being fed by my growing insecurity at being able to perform my job. It’s a really sucky place when you spend your whole life really good at something and all of a sudden basic tasks become difficult. I spent an hour and a customer site troubleshooting a communication issue when it turned out just to be a loose cat5 cable in the back office. I cost everyone a lot of money that day for a 10 second fix that should’ve been the first thing I checked. Scary and sad stuff!"

Since stepping into that I’ve found my old coping skills were insufficient and now I’m diagnosed with PTSD and taking Lexapro while we try and recover a functional baseline. This stuff isn’t easy and all my friends and family blame my therapy as the problem, not the abuse. 

At least people here and in recovery circles understand"
AdultChildren,fbkrply,t1_fbkpjxr,1576954641.0,Agreed! In those rare moments that I feel like someone gets me I cry too. Almost like I’m mourning not feeling that more often in 50 years.
AdultChildren,fbkr1qf,t1_fbkngub,1576954387.0,"“The more I tried to talk myself out of it with logic, I ended up being very judgmental of myself for not letting go as I wanted to.”

That’s profound for me! I’m constantly beating myself up for being incapable of the ideal emotional maturity I long for. 

As an example I have a new neighbor with a dog they put in the back yard who barks all night. So when I finally met him I welcomed him to the neighborhood and pet his dog. I’m terrified of conflict yet logically the fear is absurd, any “adult” would simply mention it but instead I become very resentful and fantasize passive aggressive ways to deal with it like reporting to landlord or opening his back gate in hopes the dog would run away. Instead I do nothing and suffer in silence.

My belief is if I say something it will then “become a thing” and I’ll be the bad guy even though it is his damn dog and his responsibility. And I see the whole world through that lens. Don’t rock the boat, walk on eggshells, be an enabler, people-pleasing codependency. I’ve always thought I was “just a nice guy” but it’s born of my child abuse and sadly knowing what healthy “should be” doesn’t mean my emotions/fear center agrees. 

I’m in the middle of the grieving process for months now and have no idea if I’m “doing it right”, I just get up and press on and pray this is only a necessary and beneficial season and not a forever thing."
Anxietyhelp,fbiiu05,t3_edkzyx,1576902295.0,"Definitely find a way to not hide it all the time. I grew up having to stuff my fear and other emotions and I’m pretty sure the “not talking about it” with people who could help (safe & respected adults) or people to at least listen and understand (cool friends) is why I’m now struggling in my 50’s with understanding and dealing with my emotions.

It’s awesome that you are aware of your feelings and skill in hiding them when needed, gaining that kind of self-awareness at the age of 11 is going to give you super-powers in relationships as you continue to grow and mature.

You are definitely not alone so FIND SAFE PEOPLE TO CONNECT WITH and talk about what makes you anxious, it takes a lot of the bad energy away from the hard stuff.

And have a great life!! It’s too short to waste energy on hiding how we feel!"

Even when watching tv or listening to music the tone in ALWAYS there. It could definitely drive someone insane if you don’t learn how to not focus on it.

Did you gradually get worse and this is where it is now or the most severe stuff “just started happening”.

I wish I had some advice but instead I feel like I’m headed towards where you are. Obviously the dissociation and other impairments are pretty common from all the pressure we walk around with in our head. For sure counseling, meds, meditation, support groups like ACA and self-love work can all be beneficial if not already doing them.

Until a couple days ago. I just started Lexapro for depression and GAD and waiting for something to change. I also have CFS so I can’t tell if excruciating fatigue and dizziness is the meds or cfs.

The very thing that has tried to destroy is the one thing that is connecting me to others and pointing me towards finding greater purpose beyond just being sad or striving all the time. 

I believe surviving trauma of any kind gives a person a sort of resilience and deeper life understanding than that if non-sufferers and with that we carry the burden of internal hardships to overcome but also the blessing to lead and love on others in unique and special ways.

My thought is to just “stay the course“ and let your spirit evolve through this season. I’m still deep in the mess myself but I have total faith this is well worth the hardship."

So I’m really in a position of pushing as hard as I can then recovery at the moment so hopefully I can get some kind of life back on the other side. That’s part of what prompted this posting is that I feel like I’m getting further away from being able to get a job than closer which creates its own kind of anxiety. 

So yes, I could take a break from therapy… I have enough savings for a few more months before I’m going to be forced into taking some kind of action and that is kind of my question. It almost seems like the fact that my inner world is in total chaos that we are actually starting to make progress.

AdultChildren,f9s3gzw,t3_e6lwxe,1575585312.0,"Without a doubt! Self worth sits at the core of what many if not most or even all children of dysfunctional families grow up with.

When we don’t get the nurture and the connections and the affirmations and the boundaries that we needed as children to develop “properly” (I use that term loosely) we get a narrative written for us that absolutely isn’t true.

The challenge I’m finding is I’ve had that cognitive awareness all of my life but only now in my early 50s have the wheels come off my emotional bus as it were and I am hard down with complex PTSD and depression and have been crying for more than a month. 

I’m discovering that it’s my neurological brain/body that is hanging on to the pain and my cognitive brain, as wise as it is (or I believe it to be) doesn’t have access to that part of the problem and therefore can’t fix it.

In a nutshell, I don’t believe I’m worthless anymore but I still “feel“ worthless. 

That actually makes sense because as a kid I was never directly told those exact words “you are worthless“ but I was made to “feel worthless“ by the way they treated and talked to me.

Through gestalt and EMDR type therapies I’m getting in touch with my body’s reaction to my childhood trauma and at times it’s seriously overwhelming. I now recognize that I’ve used addictions, workaholism and codependently maintaining toxic relationships to seek my childhood “normal” (which was chaos, condemnation, performance based affirmation and stuffed pain).

Recognizing the huge heart that I have always had and focusing on the good and valuable things I have accomplished in my life, along with therapy and new healthier affirming relationships are helping to push back against the false narratives.

The good news: Just like a broken arm can heal, a broken mind and heart can heal as well. 

We just need to create the conditions that are favorable for healing. Learn to love and nurture ourselves (self-parenting),  surround ourselves with people who understand value us (ACA or 12-step groups if applicable), and continue to do the things that make us feel good about what we have to offer others (support and compassion) and continually rebuke the lies buried deep within.

Symbolically this whole conversation of taking a nap at a family members house should be a no brainer, that means someone is relaxed enough that they can just let go. And to be able to do it at someone else’s house like in-laws!

It’s interesting in therapy I am discovering that even though my dad was the physical abuser I resented my mom more for not protecting me. And that’s the role I played in my own son’s life, I think they call it learned helplessness where I’ve always felt like I had no power to step in and protect/confront. 

The shame I carry of protecting my own emotions over my son’s well-being haunts me. But to your point, that has been my biggest focus; that it’s not my kids job to fix me nor is it in my power to “fix” him. As much as I hoped my sobriety was going to break the generational curse the emotional unaivailability (neglect) on my part cuts just as deep as emotional abuse and I recognize that the best way I can help him move forward is for me to become the best version of myself and simply be available for anything he identifies as a need and be very aware of not heaping new stuff on his plate.

I even had to set a boundary and not go to my family‘s Thanksgiving celebration this year because the entire tribe is a dysfunctional mess. My therapist tells me that was a good choice yet self care still comes with so much shame. They can’t understand my struggle and they take it personal and feel rejected and in a sense I guess I am rejecting them because I don’t feel safe around them.

Unfortunately my biggest struggle and deepest shame is in the form of not knowing how to parent the inner child and that my own 20-year-old son grew up with an angry narcissistic mother and me living in fear unable to help with his emotions because I couldn’t deal with my own. I actually feel resistance from the inner child not wanting a hug from me because I have ignored and disregarded his needs for decades just like my family of origin did. It seems like such a long slow process and for me sadly things have been getting worse in the last six months since this Pandora’s box has been opened.

Some of the biggest hurts I have experienced throughout my 50 years of life has been when bad stuff happens, which it always will, that nobody wanted to talk about it or the feelings it generated. As I recognize this deep need for intimate connection with others I recognize how hard it is to find people willing to face their own bad or scary feelings. 

Pretending everything is OK doesn’t make everything OK and I don’t know if this is just INTJ or some other pathology but it makes it very hard for me to trust and let anyone in."
socialskills,f9haso8,t3_e50dcx,1575312015.0,"It’s unfortunate but that describes 50 years of my life. I’m just now realizing however that my family dynamic as a young boy was performance-based people pleasing. Be perfect so you won’t get hit, yelled at or put down. 

I’ve spent my whole life pursuing narcissists and self-absorbed controllers (unconsciously) and trying to “please them“ for my self worth, and of course never getting validated. Or possibly more accurately, fulfilling the relationships that I felt I was worth. 

I’m just now learning that as I begin to love and value myself I’m no longer interested in having shallow people in my inner-circle. Shallow friend groups are fine provided we don’t need validation or support from anyone in it. But to find deeper relationships, I myself need to be willing to invest more deeply in other peoples lives as well. 

Ain’t this fun stuff :-)"
AdultChildren,f9h8gzb,t3_e4ym91,1575310861.0,"I’m in my early 50s and just now seriously opening up this Pandora’s box. From hard-core personal experience in a decade of therapy and recovery groups and still struggling with what you describe I can tell you that the core problem that needs to be faced was the invalidation many of us experienced in childhood and learning to love ourselves first.

You have great insight into the struggles that you have to overcome which already makes you farther along this growth path than millions of people who can’t even admit they are narcissist and isolating.

My accountability brothers and I constantly say “your heart is good and this is what it looks like“. 

You are on the path with great awareness, if I can offer one piece of advice find a way to celebrate the journey and stop condemning yourself by thinking your struggles are your fault.

The burdens we face were given to us, sometimes even by loving parents who just didn’t receive the very same things they weren’t capable of giving us.

Inner child work sounds silly but it’s ridiculously important. We have to learn to self-love and self nurture ourselves and encourage ourselves and learn to love ourselves just as we would our own child. For many of us it wasn’t modeled so we don’t even know what that looks like.

I can tell you one thing, it doesn’t start by thinking we are a piece of shit because we have all the the struggles.

The odds of us being born are astronomically against the odds, every single person on the planet today represents mankind and every single person has value and purpose, nobody tells us that though. We get beaten down saying that our feelings don’t matter, our curiosities and desires are stupid, and that our failures make us bad. Lies lies lies!

It sounds cliché but fighting that inner voice that says I’m no good and reframing it to “I’m a work in progress” can change everything.

I had a therapist tell me once “if only you could see yourself the way I see you“. I bet you have a huge heart with a lot of great qualities and you just haven’t been surrounded by people who see it and value that. Begin to see it in yourself and eventually you will recognize the people you’ve been hanging around aren’t your tribe. Sometimes distancing from family is important to gain healthy inner-perspective.

Anyway, I know it’s difficult and frustrating but what I see between your words is a man who know there’s better and longs for it and I believe you will accomplish what you desire, you can do this, one day at a time!"

AdultChildren,f90ljch,t3_e331x1,1574973984.0,"Wow you articulated very well what I’ve been going through for the last year. I’m in my early 50s and had everything and it’s like a nuclear bomb went off for some reason out of nowhere and I’m dealing with PTSD type stuff from my childhood. 

I’ve even said very recently stuffing my emotions and pretending everything OK was a better life than the fear anger and depression that continues to overwhelm me now.

But I have to believe that’s not true, my therapist and other people in recovery groups all confirm that I’m just doing the hard work that I should have been taught how to do as a child. We don’t get to choose what emotions come up when but if we choose to stuff them instead of deal with them it’s just like dirty dishes. The longer you put them off the bigger the pile and the harder it is to get through them all.

The key I’m told is to just stay the course and give myself tons and tons of grace. Every dish that’s picked out of the pile washed and put away is a huge victory and it’s just going to take time and that’s OK.  

As you put very well, burning down the house is not the answer and I love that visual because that’s exactly what I feel like I’ve been doing. I’ve lost my job, shoved away friends and i’m sitting home alone on Thanksgiving.

If you can it sounds like really taking some time to be thankful for all of those things you listed and knowing that if you don’t burn them down they will still be there for you when you start feeling better. That that foundation is there to help you during the season and they are not the enemy. 

You sound to be very blessed, stay the course and go easy on yourself. This is real and you didn’t create it and you can’t “make” it go away. There’s a wonderful new season for us on the other side if we  just have the courage to stay the course.

Walking on eggshells and pretending things are OK is taught to us and becomes a matter of survival and it is so incredibly toxic.

Sadly I carry around tons of shame because I am as you describe your father. I was emotionally unequipped to deal with my sons mothers drinking and narcissistic rage and so just trying to “pretend everything was OK“ was my best efforts at protecting my son. I now recognize I was perpetuating the same damage that was done to me, not teaching how to experience emotions and honor them as legitimate and let them do the work they need to do.

Above all else get in touch with people who understand what you are going through and where you can share your frustrations fears and hurts and be heard and known and understood. Lord knows the people in this group get it but it can’t hurt to find someone close who can legitimately give you a hug and make you feel safe.

That may sound weak and stupid but I’m a 50-year-old man who needs some of that myself often still today and sadly my family is too entrenched in the dysfunctional dynamics to be the ones to do that for me. It’s sad but that’s OK, it’s reality and I’m learning to face it instead of deny it or stuff it.

There is healing from this stuff but sadly while you’re in it it just keeps adding to the wounds instead of giving you space to heal. 

I would think moving out and creating safe boundaries is a really important place to start, especially at 26 years old. Like so many of us, you are behind the curve but also know you are way ahead of where I was at 26 because I couldn’t even articulate what you are sharing.

I haven’t been to an ACA group yet but I know the 12 steps are very powerful and that likely could be a great place to get plugged in if you haven’t already.

You will get through this!! And you’re surviving and thriving will give you a testimony that will help others get through this. None of these experiences are lost if you turn them into wins. 

You have an opportunity to break the family cycle. I love the idea of connecting with your father, I expect he would be willing to talk about this stuff and if you had the courage to bring it up he “might” be able to meet you in a way you never imagined. It’s not about blaming and shaming your mother, without question you both love her and want to help and I think you can do that by discovering new ways in connecting honestly in the tough stuff.

It would seem you called out a very big trigger, finding a new way to connect with your wife, maybe even sharing that when you guys argue it reminds you of your parents fighting and makes you afraid which comes out in anger. make her an ally in those vulnerable spaces if she’s mature enough and willing to go there with you.

Obviously I don’t know you or your story but I would hazard a guess that you are not the person you were when you started this journey and even expressing in the extremes right now is a form of expressing your emotions which is something us addicts don’t do well.

I’m not sure how old you are but I agree with the other commentor that having a outside awareness of the dynamics taking place is wonderfully mature and a blessing greater than you’ll likely ever realize.

I’m writing from the perspective of the dad. I grew up in an abusive household and it has taken years of therapy and now being in my 50s that I learned how to step out of receiving the hurts dumped on me from my father and blaming my mother for her inability/unwillingness to protect me.

Now I’m a dad and sadly my son’s mother fights just like you describe, my son is so wise and will try and have just an honest conversation and she gets personal and angry and vindictive and mean and it’s too close to my own childhood and I shut down. I’ve actually been diagnosed with CPTSD which explains why I’m able to love on my son but not protect him from his mothers emotional abuse when she’s triggered. 

I carry tons of shame from my inability to do more for my son but he amazes me by saying things like “come on dad it’s just mom, we know how she gets“. I have no idea where he gained that kind of wisdom but I’m incredibly grateful that he’s off to a better start than I was.

My only advice would be to connect with your brother often and let him know he’s right and that mom is just hurting and dealing with her own stuff and it’s not personal even though she makes it that way. She’s not reflecting who you guys are, she’s reflecting how she sees herself. It’s really tough and I’m sorry you guys are going through that but expressing your emotions even in Reddit and knowing you’re not alone and knowing your perspective is accurate should help some. 

She has to be willing to look inward and for lots of people it’s just too much. Prayerfully God will move her heart to recognize you guys aren’t the enemy but until that day lean on each other and keep expressing your emotions and find safe people to be around and talk about the stuff so it doesn’t eat you from the inside out like it has me my whole life."
addiction,f893mys,t3_dziwe5,1574366402.0,"First off for sure congratulations! And everyone else did well to bring up some self introspection as to what has changed or what has aligned similarly to early childhood experiences. Trauma can lay dormant until our own children reach a certain age that we were at when something went down. There may be nothing like it happening currently but the situation reminds our subconscious of the days when...

Make sure to be kind to yourself, having seasons where things come up I equate to an old fat cell that may have had some drug stored in it and it can burn decades later, but only for a moment. You have nothing to fear, it’s just “something“ going on and you, your family, and your higher power will get you through it.

On the flipside, I had 14 years sobriety and had some life events go on that I wasn’t equipped for emotionally and no support structure and I relapsed. On my very first drunk I almost died from alcohol overdose and blacking out in 23° weather on a camping trip. What they say about the disease being progressive even If we aren’t drinking is true. That first drunk led to a 10 year relapse that nearly took my life several times.

The point is, much like the Israelites wandering in the valley and missing their old captivity, they forgot how miserable it was in their old life. Don’t make the mistake of glamorizing alcoholism and thinking it will solve any of your problems. It’s a living hell that we fought with every ounce of our lives to break free from. 

I’m now coming up on nine years of sobriety again and I still occasionally have thoughts when life gets hard if using but I don’t know if I have recovery from another relapse left in me, staying sober is the only way to survive.

I myself have recently been diagnosed with C-PTSD which is basically I grew up in a fear and condemning-based environment as a child and spent my whole life striving to run from those lies that were fed to me through people-pleasing, workaholism and perfectionism.

The hardest battle no one ever teaches us is the one where we learn to love and care for ourselves first before we try meeting the expectations of the world around us.

You are awesome, you just don’t realize it yet. 

Being right where you are with all of this is perfectly OK and it absolutely will get better if you cut yourself some slack and allow yourself to be human. 

Our insides never match what people look like on the outside but you can bet most people battle with the same stuff you’re describing.

You got this, being 19 and on the path to greater self-awareness, self love and self actualization means you have an endless number of opportunities ahead of you,  and time to figure it out, how exciting!"
Anxietyhelp,f7cgbw2,t3_dvb4ya,1573591651.0,"Somewhere along the line too many of us were taught that trying something new with the risk of failing is a bad thing. 

Hard things do not equal bad things. In fact hard things  often lead to better things. 

The pursuit of comfort and easy and security and safety and assurances is what keeps us stuck where we are in life.

The battle is in how we frame opportunity. 

We can see it as an opportunity to grow and experience new things and live life on a more exciting edge or we can frame it as risk and danger and an opportunity for failure and shame.

Reframing is critical

An example of how we already know how to do that could be someone being afraid of a job interview but loving Halloween scare mazes. Some fear we frame as good and enjoyable and even desirable and other fear we frame as dangerous and undesirable.

The tragedy is how often we face our fear on stupid stuff and let other fear keep us from experiencing the best things life has to offer.

I’m truly excited for your opportunity to find a full-time position and take your career to the next level. We never know how to do something before we start doing it, 

If they are willing to take a chance on you then embrace the opportunity and take a chance on yourself.

Bottom line, you are free to make your own choices and responsible for taking ownership for them. You can take a chance and see where it goes or choose to play it safe and potentially be unemployed when the contract runs out. 

Good luck with your decision 👍😃"

I’m now trying to figure out if what you describe is healthy reframing or unhealthy denial. Nothing in my world has a gray area so it’s either super awesome or really horrible, not sure which, sorry. Give me a few days of isolation and rumination and I’ll have a answer for ya."
addiction,f71n5rs,t3_dtybaw,1573344073.0,"I had 14 years of drug and alcohol sobriety and I had some personal crap go down that was so emotionally overwhelming that I hit the bottle again. I thought it would just be for a weekend and it turned into a 10 year relapse that nearly took my life. I don’t know if you’ve heard the statistics but they say no matter how much time you have clean our addiction continues to get worse behind the scenes.

One drink or drug could cost you your life, the price is too high! 

In five years you have successfully navigated so much of life without needing it. Is there really anything worth giving up five years of sobriety? That’s really going to improve your life? 

Remember what it was like before you quit? 

Remember how difficult that first year of sobriety was? Wanna do that all over again?

Praying for you bro, you know you’ve got everything in you to get through this moment and it’s only temporary. I look forward to reading about your testimony about how you got through this successfully 🙏👍

Edit: I just read that you lost your pre-born child, that is a horrible pain, I’m very sorry. There’s no way I can know what that feels like but I will share that my closest friend of nearly 10 years and his wife are pregnant again after losing their first child a couple years ago. The memory will always be with you but your victory in overcoming this will give you a testimony that can help the thousands of other couples who have and will experience this. You are not alone, connecting with others will help I promise

cfs,f661cuo,t1_f654iar,1572707012.0,"That’s great your job is supportive and non-toxic. I think many of us with cfs can feel guilty or weak-willed or told it’s in our head and as a result we place higher performance expectations on ourselves than others do. 

If you can’t perform at the same level as before you got sick make sure to stay aware of self induced push/crash risk. I self-sabotage still when I feel even a little better thinking I can “push through”.  
 
We may not be able to push through like before but there are things we can pace through.

I looking forward to hearing how day two goes 🙏"
