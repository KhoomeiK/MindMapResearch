I don‚Äôt know why I dug my heels in and argued with him and tried to make him feel foolish for his ignorance and then realized I was wrong. I had never done anything like that before, I think I felt threatened which again I think was being fed by my growing insecurity at being able to perform my job. It‚Äôs a really sucky place when you spend your whole life really good at something and all of a sudden basic tasks become difficult.

Since stepping into that I‚Äôve found my old coping skills were insufficient and now I‚Äôm diagnosed with PTSD and taking Lexapro while we try and recover a functional baseline.

That‚Äôs profound for me! I‚Äôm constantly beating myself up for being incapable of the ideal emotional maturity I long for. 

As an example I have a new neighbor with a dog they put in the back yard who barks all night. So when I finally met him I welcomed him to the neighborhood and pet his dog. I‚Äôm terrified of conflict yet logically the fear is absurd, any ‚Äúadult‚Äù would simply mention it but instead I become very resentful and fantasize passive aggressive ways to deal with it like reporting to landlord or opening his back gate in hopes the dog would run away. Instead I do nothing and suffer in silence.

My belief is if I say something it will then ‚Äúbecome a thing‚Äù and I‚Äôll be the bad guy even though it is his damn dog and his responsibility. And I see the whole world through that lens. Don‚Äôt rock the boat, walk on eggshells, be an enabler, people-pleasing codependency. I‚Äôve always thought I was ‚Äújust a nice guy‚Äù but it‚Äôs born of my child abuse and sadly knowing what healthy ‚Äúshould be‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean my emotions/fear center agrees.

It‚Äôs awesome that you are aware of your feelings and skill in hiding them when needed, gaining that kind of self-awareness at the age of 11 is going to give you super-powers in relationships as you continue to grow and mature.

You are definitely not alone so FIND SAFE PEOPLE TO CONNECT WITH and talk about what makes you anxious, it takes a lot of the bad energy away from the hard stuff.

Did you gradually get worse and this is where it is now or the most severe stuff ‚Äújust started happening‚Äù.

I wish I had some advice but instead I feel like I‚Äôm headed towards where you are.

I believe surviving trauma of any kind gives a person a sort of resilience and deeper life understanding than that if non-sufferers and with that we carry the burden of internal hardships to overcome but also the blessing to lead and love on others in unique and special ways.

AdultChildren,f9s3gzw,t3_e6lwxe,1575585312.0,"Without a doubt! Self worth sits at the core of what many if not most or even all children of dysfunctional families grow up with.

When we don‚Äôt get the nurture and the connections and the affirmations and the boundaries that we needed as children to develop ‚Äúproperly‚Äù (I use that term loosely) we get a narrative written for us that absolutely isn‚Äôt true.

The challenge I‚Äôm finding is I‚Äôve had that cognitive awareness all of my life but only now in my early 50s have the wheels come off my emotional bus as it were and I am hard down with complex PTSD and depression and have been crying for more than a month. 

I‚Äôm discovering that it‚Äôs my neurological brain/body that is hanging on to the pain and my cognitive brain, as wise as it is (or I believe it to be) doesn‚Äôt have access to that part of the problem and therefore can‚Äôt fix it.

In a nutshell, I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm worthless anymore but I still ‚Äúfeel‚Äú worthless. 

That actually makes sense because as a kid I was never directly told those exact words ‚Äúyou are worthless‚Äú but I was made to ‚Äúfeel worthless‚Äú by the way they treated and talked to me.

Through gestalt and EMDR type therapies I‚Äôm getting in touch with my body‚Äôs reaction to my childhood trauma and at times it‚Äôs seriously overwhelming. I now recognize that I‚Äôve used addictions, workaholism and codependently maintaining toxic relationships to seek my childhood ‚Äúnormal‚Äù (which was chaos, condemnation, performance based affirmation and stuffed pain).

Recognizing the huge heart that I have always had and focusing on the good and valuable things I have accomplished in my life, along with therapy and new healthier affirming relationships are helping to push back against the false narratives.

The good news: Just like a broken arm can heal, a broken mind and heart can heal as well. 

We just need to create the conditions that are favorable for healing. Learn to love and nurture ourselves (self-parenting),  surround ourselves with people who understand value us (ACA or 12-step groups if applicable), and continue to do the things that make us feel good about what we have to offer others (support and compassion) and continually rebuke the lies buried deep within.

The shame I carry of protecting my own emotions over my son‚Äôs well-being haunts me.

As much as I hoped my sobriety was going to break the generational curse the emotional unaivailability (neglect) on my part cuts just as deep as emotional abuse and I recognize that the best way I can help him move forward is for me to become the best version of myself and simply be available for anything he identifies as a need and be very aware of not heaping new stuff on his plate.

I‚Äôm so incredibly happy for your marriage and in-laws being healthy, it speaks to the deepest longings of my heart to find that before time runs out."
CPTSD,f9n3ed9,t1_f9myojt,1575476149.0,"I‚Äôm glad I read your response before I replied because I was going to say the same thing, I‚Äôm just now starting this inner child self parenting work with my therapist and the previous response was right on!

Unfortunately my biggest struggle and deepest shame is in the form of not knowing how to parent the inner child and that my own 20-year-old son grew up with an angry narcissistic mother and me living in fear unable to help with his emotions because I couldn‚Äôt deal with my own. I actually feel resistance from the inner child not wanting a hug from me because I have ignored and disregarded his needs for decades just like my family of origin did. It seems like such a long slow process and for me sadly things have been getting worse in the last six months since this Pandora‚Äôs box has been opened.

Anyway, thanks for this post, the dialogue and suggestions are helping me a lot both in providing affirmation on what the road ahead looks like and comfort that I‚Äôm not alone or crazy."

I think the biggest on your list that stood out for me that I‚Äôm just now getting in touch with through lots of therapy is that I hate phoniness or lying. Some of the biggest hurts I have experienced throughout my 50 years of life has been when bad stuff happens, which it always will, that nobody wanted to talk about it or the feelings it generated. As I recognize this deep need for intimate connection with others I recognize how hard it is to find people willing to face their own bad or scary feelings. 

Pretending everything is OK doesn‚Äôt make everything OK and I don‚Äôt know if this is just INTJ or some other pathology but it makes it very hard for me to trust and let anyone in."

I‚Äôve spent my whole life pursuing narcissists and self-absorbed controllers (unconsciously) and trying to ‚Äúplease them‚Äú for my self worth, and of course never getting validated. Or possibly more accurately, fulfilling the relationships that I felt I was worth. 

I‚Äôm just now learning that as I begin to love and value myself I‚Äôm no longer interested in having shallow people in my inner-circle. Shallow friend groups are fine provided we don‚Äôt need validation or support from anyone in it. But to find deeper relationships, I myself need to be willing to invest more deeply in other peoples lives as well. 

Ain‚Äôt this fun stuff :-)"
AdultChildren,f9h8gzb,t3_e4ym91,1575310861.0,"I‚Äôm in my early 50s and just now seriously opening up this Pandora‚Äôs box. From hard-core personal experience in a decade of therapy and recovery groups and still struggling with what you describe I can tell you that the core problem that needs to be faced was the invalidation many of us experienced in childhood and learning to love ourselves first.

You have great insight into the struggles that you have to overcome which already makes you farther along this growth path than millions of people who can‚Äôt even admit they are narcissist and isolating.

My accountability brothers and I constantly say ‚Äúyour heart is good and this is what it looks like‚Äú. 

You are on the path with great awareness, if I can offer one piece of advice find a way to celebrate the journey and stop condemning yourself by thinking your struggles are your fault.

The burdens we face were given to us, sometimes even by loving parents who just didn‚Äôt receive the very same things they weren‚Äôt capable of giving us.

Inner child work sounds silly but it‚Äôs ridiculously important. We have to learn to self-love and self nurture ourselves and encourage ourselves and learn to love ourselves just as we would our own child. For many of us it wasn‚Äôt modeled so we don‚Äôt even know what that looks like.

I can tell you one thing, it doesn‚Äôt start by thinking we are a piece of shit because we have all the the struggles.

The odds of us being born are astronomically against the odds, every single person on the planet today represents mankind and every single person has value and purpose, nobody tells us that though. We get beaten down saying that our feelings don‚Äôt matter, our curiosities and desires are stupid, and that our failures make us bad. Lies lies lies!

It sounds clich√© but fighting that inner voice that says I‚Äôm no good and reframing it to ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a work in progress‚Äù can change everything.

I had a therapist tell me once ‚Äúif only you could see yourself the way I see you‚Äú. I bet you have a huge heart with a lot of great qualities and you just haven‚Äôt been surrounded by people who see it and value that. Begin to see it in yourself and eventually you will recognize the people you‚Äôve been hanging around aren‚Äôt your tribe. Sometimes distancing from family is important to gain healthy inner-perspective.

Anyway, I know it‚Äôs difficult and frustrating but what I see between your words is a man who know there‚Äôs better and longs for it and I believe you will accomplish what you desire, you can do this, one day at a time!"

AdultChildren,f90ljch,t3_e331x1,1574973984.0,"Wow you articulated very well what I‚Äôve been going through for the last year. I‚Äôm in my early 50s and had everything and it‚Äôs like a nuclear bomb went off for some reason out of nowhere and I‚Äôm dealing with PTSD type stuff from my childhood. 

I‚Äôve even said very recently stuffing my emotions and pretending everything OK was a better life than the fear anger and depression that continues to overwhelm me now.

But I have to believe that‚Äôs not true, my therapist and other people in recovery groups all confirm that I‚Äôm just doing the hard work that I should have been taught how to do as a child. We don‚Äôt get to choose what emotions come up when but if we choose to stuff them instead of deal with them it‚Äôs just like dirty dishes. The longer you put them off the bigger the pile and the harder it is to get through them all.

The key I‚Äôm told is to just stay the course and give myself tons and tons of grace. Every dish that‚Äôs picked out of the pile washed and put away is a huge victory and it‚Äôs just going to take time and that‚Äôs OK.  

As you put very well, burning down the house is not the answer and I love that visual because that‚Äôs exactly what I feel like I‚Äôve been doing. I‚Äôve lost my job, shoved away friends and i‚Äôm sitting home alone on Thanksgiving.

If you can it sounds like really taking some time to be thankful for all of those things you listed and knowing that if you don‚Äôt burn them down they will still be there for you when you start feeling better.

Walking on eggshells and pretending things are OK is taught to us and becomes a matter of survival and it is so incredibly toxic.

Sadly I carry around tons of shame because I am as you describe your father. I was emotionally unequipped to deal with my sons mothers drinking and narcissistic rage and so just trying to ‚Äúpretend everything was OK‚Äú was my best efforts at protecting my son. I now recognize I was perpetuating the same damage that was done to me, not teaching how to experience emotions and honor them as legitimate and let them do the work they need to do.

Above all else get in touch with people who understand what you are going through and where you can share your frustrations fears and hurts and be heard and known and understood. Lord knows the people in this group get it but it can‚Äôt hurt to find someone close who can legitimately give you a hug and make you feel safe.

That may sound weak and stupid but I‚Äôm a 50-year-old man who needs some of that myself often still today and sadly my family is too entrenched in the dysfunctional dynamics to be the ones to do that for me. It‚Äôs sad but that‚Äôs OK, it‚Äôs reality and I‚Äôm learning to face it instead of deny it or stuff it.

There is healing from this stuff but sadly while you‚Äôre in it it just keeps adding to the wounds instead of giving you space to heal. 

I would think moving out and creating safe boundaries is a really important place to start, especially at 26 years old. Like so many of us, you are behind the curve but also know you are way ahead of where I was at 26 because I couldn‚Äôt even articulate what you are sharing.

I haven‚Äôt been to an ACA group yet but I know the 12 steps are very powerful and that likely could be a great place to get plugged in if you haven‚Äôt already.

You will get through this!! And you‚Äôre surviving and thriving will give you a testimony that will help others get through this. None of these experiences are lost if you turn them into wins. 

You have an opportunity to break the family cycle. I love the idea of connecting with your father, I expect he would be willing to talk about this stuff and if you had the courage to bring it up he ‚Äúmight‚Äù be able to meet you in a way you never imagined. It‚Äôs not about blaming and shaming your mother, without question you both love her and want to help and I think you can do that by discovering new ways in connecting honestly in the tough stuff.

I‚Äôm not sure how old you are but I agree with the other commentor that having a outside awareness of the dynamics taking place is wonderfully mature and a blessing greater than you‚Äôll likely ever realize.

I‚Äôm writing from the perspective of the dad. I grew up in an abusive household and it has taken years of therapy and now being in my 50s that I learned how to step out of receiving the hurts dumped on me from my father and blaming my mother for her inability/unwillingness to protect me.

Now I‚Äôm a dad and sadly my son‚Äôs mother fights just like you describe, my son is so wise and will try and have just an honest conversation and she gets personal and angry and vindictive and mean and it‚Äôs too close to my own childhood and I shut down. I‚Äôve actually been diagnosed with CPTSD which explains why I‚Äôm able to love on my son but not protect him from his mothers emotional abuse when she‚Äôs triggered. 

I carry tons of shame from my inability to do more for my son but he amazes me by saying things like ‚Äúcome on dad it‚Äôs just mom, we know how she gets‚Äú. I have no idea where he gained that kind of wisdom but I‚Äôm incredibly grateful that he‚Äôs off to a better start than I was.

My only advice would be to connect with your brother often and let him know he‚Äôs right and that mom is just hurting and dealing with her own stuff and it‚Äôs not personal even though she makes it that way. She‚Äôs not reflecting who you guys are, she‚Äôs reflecting how she sees herself. It‚Äôs really tough and I‚Äôm sorry you guys are going through that but expressing your emotions even in Reddit and knowing you‚Äôre not alone and knowing your perspective is accurate should help some. 

She has to be willing to look inward and for lots of people it‚Äôs just too much.

Make sure to be kind to yourself, having seasons where things come up I equate to an old fat cell that may have had some drug stored in it and it can burn decades later, but only for a moment.

On the flipside, I had 14 years sobriety and had some life events go on that I wasn‚Äôt equipped for emotionally and no support structure and I relapsed. On my very first drunk I almost died from alcohol overdose and blacking out in 23¬∞ weather on a camping trip. What they say about the disease being progressive even If we aren‚Äôt drinking is true. That first drunk led to a 10 year relapse that nearly took my life several times.

The point is, much like the Israelites wandering in the valley and missing their old captivity, they forgot how miserable it was in their old life. Don‚Äôt make the mistake of glamorizing alcoholism and thinking it will solve any of your problems. It‚Äôs a living hell that we fought with every ounce of our lives to break free from. 

I‚Äôm now coming up on nine years of sobriety again and I still occasionally have thoughts when life gets hard if using but I don‚Äôt know if I have recovery from another relapse left in me, staying sober is the only way to survive.

I always say yes to invites and special occasions ‚Äúhoping‚Äú that I will be having a strong day when the event comes around but nine times out of 10 I end up disappointing everyone and backing out last minute. I have close friends who are supportive and say that self-care is always the best choice but it just doesn‚Äôt feel that way when letting people down"

One of the 5 bosses I had I trusted so I shared with him in confidence but everyone else I just told ‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking some time off for personal reasons‚Äú. I‚Äôm assuming the boss I trusted probably told at least one or some other people however nobody questioned me when I got back, they were just happy to see me."
cfs,f7d9o59,t3_dv1lbj,1573611150.0,It‚Äôs a real thing. I am an INTJ and a strategist so thinking used to be my good friend but 15 months with CFS and out of work I am losing my mind. I got into therapy and started uncorking some childhood stuff and now I have been diagnosed with CPTSD. I think I managed it somewhat OK my whole life because I had a career which I loved but with that gone it feels like it‚Äôs my mind now creating the exhaustion.
cfs,f7d90jo,t3_dvht4m,1573610689.0,"My primary care physician looked me in the eye and said ‚Äúmaybe in five years you‚Äôll get bad enough that we can see what is going on‚Äú. 

And I had a rheumatologist say ‚Äúthis is serious, don‚Äôt you know you could lose your job if you don‚Äôt go back to work‚Äú. As if I had a choice! 

That was eight months ago and I have since lost my 30 year career. No more doctors or specialists, they quit seeing me. 

Because I‚Äôm now on Medi-Cal I now have a new primary care physician and at least he is willing to try some new testing again, but I‚Äôm less than optimistic.

It truly feels like we are all alone in this battle. Yes we‚Äôve got each other but seems like nobody else believes us."
Anxietyhelp,f7d6fku,t1_f7ct2sa,1573608819.0,I love it! The beautiful thing is you are never trapped. At worst you gain experience and move on. At best you love it and move up. Either way you win. Best wishes!
Anxiety,f7chkn5,t3_duscnx,1573592408.0,"What you‚Äôre describing is a very real place and the previous commentor has nailed it. 

I‚Äôm now in my 50s and have lived my whole life with those levels of fear and insecurity and have been successful but miserable. The hope I see in your message is that you are already aware and able to articulate your fears and insecurities and self-doubt, it took me my whole life to wake up.

I suspect those thoughts and feelings come from stuff that was told to you earlier in life and not based on your actual life experiences. 

Perfectionism is a cancer that destroys the soul.

I myself have recently been diagnosed with C-PTSD which is basically I grew up in a fear and condemning-based environment as a child and spent my whole life striving to run from those lies that were fed to me through people-pleasing, workaholism and perfectionism.

The hardest battle no one ever teaches us is the one where we learn to love and care for ourselves first before we try meeting the expectations of the world around us.

You are awesome, you just don‚Äôt realize it yet. 

Being right where you are with all of this is perfectly OK and it absolutely will get better if you cut yourself some slack and allow yourself to be human. 

Our insides never match what people look like on the outside but you can bet most people battle with the same stuff you‚Äôre describing.

You got this, being 19 and on the path to greater self-awareness, self love and self actualization means you have an endless number of opportunities ahead of you,  and time to figure it out, how exciting!"
Anxietyhelp,f7cgbw2,t3_dvb4ya,1573591651.0,"Somewhere along the line too many of us were taught that trying something new with the risk of failing is a bad thing. 

Hard things do not equal bad things. In fact hard things  often lead to better things. 

The pursuit of comfort and easy and security and safety and assurances is what keeps us stuck where we are in life.

The battle is in how we frame opportunity. 

We can see it as an opportunity to grow and experience new things and live life on a more exciting edge or we can frame it as risk and danger and an opportunity for failure and shame.

Reframing is critical

An example of how we already know how to do that could be someone being afraid of a job interview but loving Halloween scare mazes. Some fear we frame as good and enjoyable and even desirable and other fear we frame as dangerous and undesirable.

The tragedy is how often we face our fear on stupid stuff and let other fear keep us from experiencing the best things life has to offer.

I‚Äôm truly excited for your opportunity to find a full-time position and take your career to the next level. We never know how to do something before we start doing it, 

If they are willing to take a chance on you then embrace the opportunity and take a chance on yourself.

Bottom line, you are free to make your own choices and responsible for taking ownership for them. You can take a chance and see where it goes or choose to play it safe and potentially be unemployed when the contract runs out. 

Good luck with your decision üëçüòÉ"
mentalhealth,f79lvp2,t3_dur7yd,1573509524.0,"Thanks! As if I don‚Äôt have enough to overthink about already. 

I‚Äôm now trying to figure out if what you describe is healthy reframing or unhealthy denial. Nothing in my world has a gray area so it‚Äôs either super awesome or really horrible, not sure which, sorry. Give me a few days of isolation and rumination and I‚Äôll have a answer for ya."
addiction,f71n5rs,t3_dtybaw,1573344073.0,"I had 14 years of drug and alcohol sobriety and I had some personal crap go down that was so emotionally overwhelming that I hit the bottle again. I thought it would just be for a weekend and it turned into a 10 year relapse that nearly took my life. I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve heard the statistics but they say no matter how much time you have clean our addiction continues to get worse behind the scenes.

One drink or drug could cost you your life, the price is too high! 

In five years you have successfully navigated so much of life without needing it. Is there really anything worth giving up five years of sobriety? That‚Äôs really going to improve your life? 

Remember what it was like before you quit? 

Remember how difficult that first year of sobriety was? Wanna do that all over again?

Praying for you bro, you know you‚Äôve got everything in you to get through this moment and it‚Äôs only temporary. I look forward to reading about your testimony about how you got through this successfully üôèüëç

Edit: I just read that you lost your pre-born child, that is a horrible pain, I‚Äôm very sorry. There‚Äôs no way I can know what that feels like but I will share that my closest friend of nearly 10 years and his wife are pregnant again after losing their first child a couple years ago. The memory will always be with you but your victory in overcoming this will give you a testimony that can help the thousands of other couples who have and will experience this. You are not alone, connecting with others will help I promise

cfs,f661cuo,t1_f654iar,1572707012.0,"That‚Äôs great your job is supportive and non-toxic. I think many of us with cfs can feel guilty or weak-willed or told it‚Äôs in our head and as a result we place higher performance expectations on ourselves than others do. 

If you can‚Äôt perform at the same level as before you got sick make sure to stay aware of self induced push/crash risk. I self-sabotage still when I feel even a little better thinking I can ‚Äúpush through‚Äù.  
 
We may not be able to push through like before but there are things we can pace through.

I looking forward to hearing how day two goes üôè"
