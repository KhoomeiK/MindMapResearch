Making up a story to cover his actions is super shitty, though I do think its a good sign that he answered honestly when you confronted him. 

Given your history, this is obviously a huge trigger and your feelings are so valid. You said yourself that it stems from not feeling like you are enough, sexually. No wonder you're hurt! I have the same reaction to when my SO did the same thing. 

We had one incident a few months ago where I could hear him masturbating and asked him if he was, jokingly. He said no. But I knew it was a lie. And lying to my is my biggest rule. No reason to ever lie to me. I asked him 2 more times and he still denied. I got serious and said it was a big deal. He told me he was but he felt totally stupid when I asked so he just checked out of the situation. From that moment forward, we have a safe word for instances where we feel like deer in the headlights and just want to talk about it later. We have used it often and its so helpful. 

Since I have complex feelings about not being desireable with the porn stuff, these are some things that have really helped. These arent things that Ive asked, but things that have kind of evolved over time and stuck because of positive reinforcement, I guess. 

I dont see porn as a threat in my current relationship, logically or mentally, but I still get complex emotional feelings about it. He has started to ask if it's ok if he watches porn during our sexy session. (98% of the time, he watches solo videos I've sent him, or videos we made when we were together. This turns me on so much and makes me feel so wanted.) Its pretty rare when he asks but I appreciate it so much when he does. I like this because it gives me the option to tell him how I feel. Sometimes I say no, because Im currently needing all his attention because Im feeling exceptionally vulnerable and needing extra love and care and intimate connection. The times I do say go for it, he assures me whatever hes watching hes thinking of me and him. I love this, too. Makes me feel so loved and secure. Sometimes I even ask to watch it with him because I want to see/feel the mood hes in and see the delicious and terrible things he wants to do to me next time we meet. Most of the time I have zero desire to watch because I feel it might trigger a mental clausterfuck and take me out of the mood. 

I try to remind myself that just because he needs visual stimulation doesnt mean he loves me any less or that Im not good enough. The moment I start to feel myself get anxious about it, I try to remind myself that I too need porn sometimes. And thats usually because Im too tired, stressed, distracted, etc. I just need a lil jump start. As long as my needs are being met, Im ok with it. Its his body. But its important to me he doesnt lie, and it makes me love him even more when hes so respectful and accommodating with my issue. 

I hope you make the best decision for you and can find yourself in a place of confidence and trust."
TwoXChromosomes,foxy90i,t1_fow06z6,1588160259.0,"I agree with you. But depression isnt rational. Suicide, largely, isnt a rational decision. 

I thought I would feel the same way after having a kid. But his birth was traumatic and gave me ptsd. Took me years to feel bonded to him. I had severe PPD. I knew all of those were possibilities, yet it still couldnt have ever prepared me for the level of despair it caused me. 

You see, the depression was telling me my family would be better off without me. My SO would remarry. He would find a better mom. A selfless stable grounded loving mom. My son would be too young to remember me. I was convinced of this, every day, for years. 

Think about how sure you are, how convinced and stable you are in the fact that you would never do that to your kid, and thats the level of confidence I had that my family would be better off and happier if I didnt exist. I thought about running away. But I thought it would be easier for my son to accept and know that I was dead, over not knowing where I was or how I was doing. 

For me, suicide wasnt about wanting to die. It was wanting to end the pain and mental turmoil. Think about someone who was in crippling and agonizing physical pain for 19 years. Lots of therapies and medications didnt work. Would you have more empathy with their decision to end their life? Or should they stay alive for their children? Is it about quantity or quality of life? I might be the odd one out but suicide isnt a blanket ""always bad"" option."

Maybe try cooking with bone broth? Cooked marrow is delicious and rich, too. Take fish oil supplements. Cook with animal fat. Add colligen to your smoothies. Dont feel like you need to use the entire amount of meat a recipe calls for. Like do spaghetti (squash), but use less than half the meat and bulk it up with a lot of other veggies.

Edit: Try Applegate breakfast sausage. If you liked the fastfood meat, they have some sweet ones with maple syrup but the ingredients are relatively clean. Applegate makes Whole30 breakfast sausage, and Pedersons makes Whole30 bacon as well. Both are a bit cleaner. Organ meats come to mind as well if your goal is mostly nutrition."

Some people have more severe reactions to different types of dairy. *Avocado or coconut cream were some of my favorite dairy subs. (And whole foods has wonderful dairy subs. Check out miyoko, kite hill, and tree line brands for starters!)

If you're wanting to go hard, I highly recommend doing a Whole30. Its strict paleo for 30 days. It was revolutionary for my health. You slowly reintroduce foods and see what upset your system in different ways. Its 100% worth the research, time, and dedication. I learned so much about my body, my intolerances, and things like hidden ingredients and labels when shopping. Whole30 can be done cost effectively and simply. Theres so many resources and inspiration on instagram, too. 

I wish you the best of luck! 
It took me 3 years to tweak my diet to find what was not only physically healthy but mentally healthy, too. I find when I eat paleo vegan, thats when I feel the brightest. Do I have occasional dairy or meat, 100%. You have to find some balance and a groove that works for you."

I’m so sorry you’re hurting.

I (F29) also have BPD, and have been in an open long distance relationship for the past 6 months. (I was in a 2 year off and on LDR before that. Half the time in his country and half the time with me.)

Regarding the things you’re struggling with,

 

Self control over emotions (and excessive overthinking) – I recommend reading about DBT therapy and possibly picking through some work books. One new technique that’s been helpful is when Im having an intense emotion, I imagine it on a leaf, floating down a creek that sits before me. And I do my best to acknowledge it, accept it, and just let it pass by. Meditation and looking into “radical acceptance” has been helpful, as well. I also use “spock brain” to calm myself down. Try to analyze it with emotions removed and just look at the situation with logic/facts/etc.

 

Depersonalization  - I know depersonalization can look different for everyone. For me, I just mentally check out. Like kinda not all present. Like my lights are out. I usually just go lay down with a weighted blanket, or cuddle if my partner is available. When I feel it coming on, I give my partner a heads up. You can develop your own check-in system with your partner and find what works for you. Getting some extra reassurance when I feel “out of it” and him asking “is there anything I can do to help?” does wonders for me. I usually just ask for memes or funny videos and will let him know Ill check in later when I can.

 

Self-blaming – Reading “Love me, Don’t leave me” was really eye opening in learning about the (rather fucked up) core beliefs I have of myself. And therapy allowed me to explore where in childhood those things came from, and then work to heal them. I found that for me personally, the self-blaming was learned early on. I have to constantly remind myself to be gentle with myself. One thing that’s been helpful, is imagine the 5yo or 10yo version of yourself. Talk to yourself you way you would to them. You wouldn’t be mean or impatient. You would probably be very loving, understanding, and kind.

 

As far as your comment about being honest and you pulling him down with you, personally, I’m finding that I don’t need to share everything I feel. When we are having intense or heavy discussions, sometimes I am triggered into a reactive state. I can tell because my heart rate is elevated, my solar plexus or stomach is burning, sometimes I get shaky. It feels like a rush of adrenaline. First, we started using a separate app for heavy discussions or potential triggering topics. This way, if one of us doesn’t have the spoons, we don’t have to open and read the message till we fortified and ready. Secondly, I try to make myself wait a couple hours, or even sleep on it, before I share something. When Im feeling reactive, I don’t make any big decisions either. And I’ve started free writing when I’m upset as well. It helps me feel like I’m “telling” someone but not sharing it with my lover. Most of the time, the next day, I don’t feel as strongly, and I can discuss the highlights with my partner in a much calmer and clearer state. We also use a safeword during our discussions that if one of us says it, we know to end the discussion and we will pick it up later.

 

Have you shared with him how you like to receive affection?

“He’s a bit more quiet and modest in expression than me…” Same with my partner as well. When I’m having a rough day, stuck in my own head, I just ask him for reassurance that he loves me. This can go a long way on shitty days.


Sorry this is all over the place. Just wanted to share some tidbits because I can relate a bit. BPD is a bitch but can be so much more manageable with work. I wish you all the best with therapy! I suggest checking out r/BPD too!

(And feel free to DM me anytime.)

I would dumb down your diet to very simple (paleo) staples, and build up from there. I would look at starch content, too. Stuff that turns into sugar in your gut. 

I find grains to be most inflammatory. Legumes upset me, too. I wouldnt try adding those back in till your stomach is healed. 

Poke around at FODMAP and candida diets. 

(My grandpa just told me about a Mediterranean diet that has a protocol for what order you ingest foods. Like, you dont eat potatoes after meat because meat takes forever to digest and the potatoes ""rot"" on top of the meat since they break down so much faster. I know nothing about it but thought I would mention since you said you felt like the food just sat there.) 

Have you had your stomach acid tested? Or stool checked? 

Im so sorry youre going through this. It's so frustrating! I hope you find relief soon. 

Oh, as far as protein, Ive poked around on vegan threads for help, too. I feel best when Im paleo vegan. It means I cant really eat a ton of stuff, but I feel really good."

Paleo,fjnvd42,t1_fjnsvgp,1583515108.0,"Peanut oil SHREDS my guts. Gives me an upset stomach for a couple days. The soy and corn make me SUPER puffy. It looks like I gain 20 pounds overnight. Its not a big deal (like other stuff makes my stomach upset or gives me terrible brain fog, bad acne, sour mood or worse anxiety, or muscle and joint pain, etc.) but its just very obvious to me that its not agreeable with my body. And I feel like when my body is fighting the things I put in it, it can cause a lot of other issues. So my goal is to make my body as happy and healthy as possible. 

(There could be more effects that I dont remember but I havent had much of it in my diet the past 3 years so its hard to say. Other stuff, like dairy, that Ive had more of off and on over the last couple years, I know my EXACT reaction. Every time, I get sensitive gums, systic acne, bloated/hard stomach, my mood takes a dip, quality in sleep suffers, and if I eat it a few days in a row I get inflammation in my neck and shoulders and sometimes wake up with a crick in my neck.)"
Paleo,fjn21vu,t3_fec0ng,1583495011.0,"For me its the oils they use. Im sensitive to corn/soy/peanut oil. 

This is actually a huge plus when looking at restaurants. If they say they use olive/avocado/coconut oil, they most likely have other clean options. 

Places that have food labeled take a lot of anxiety down for me. Whole foods has their food bar labeled with ingredients. Theres a Mediterranean buffet near me that has everything labeled. I usually call ahead to ask questions. Going out to dives/bars are damn near impossible for me to eat out at. Since I dont drink or eat much meat, I usually have the most basic salad you can imagine.

Im actually in my second long distance relationship with a kiwi because I got on Tinder when I took the holiday to visit my first kiwi, despite breaking up months before. Its now been 6 months. I revisited last month and met some more of his friends and family. Hes coming in May to meet my friends and family, and to decide if we want to give this a go with a 3 month visa. It was totally supposed to be a one night stand. He wanted to stay single. I didnt want another long distance relationship. But by the end of my trip we were both talking visas. Whoops! 

First kiwi was a regular at my coffee bar. I was a barista. He was over here on a visa. We chat every morning. I fell head over heels. His visa got cut short and he had to go back early. I was lucky that he could come over here for months at a time. We did LDR off and on for 2 years. 

I've been anxious about introducing my new partner just because I met him in New Zealand. I know I'm going to look crazy. (I am. A lil bit.) But hes fun and amazing so Im trying not to overthink it."

There was a girl my age. Came in every day. Twice a day. Ordered the same thing. We geeked out about health stuff and spent many long chats together across the coffee bar as I worked.
