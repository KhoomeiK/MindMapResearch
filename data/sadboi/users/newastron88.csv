depression,f6ickhy,t3_drd1r4,1572876148.0,"Sometimes my mom and my relatives talk to me about how hard lives can be for other people and how I should appreciate what I have. Such talk doesn't give much effect onto my state of mind. All I keep thinking about is why I can't have a normal life and feel simple happiness like others. I think they try their best to make me feel better. That's their best pep talk. And I wish I could be better for their sake but it is hard to shake off all these endless negative thoughts. 

I hope you go seek help from a doctor. It can help! I am having medication as well and I do see some small changes in my thoughts."
depression,f5w2mgq,t3_dpadbk,1572512004.0,"I'm sitting alone here. I feel the same. I am too lonely. I feel a bit sick in my stomach, hungry for connection. I don't know what it is and how to cure this hunger. I wish there is someone I can talk to. I wish I can find out what i wanna do. Everything is such a puzzle for me these days. And I'm afraid. So afraid. People say that just do something, try something new, better yourself... but i feel that everything is just a temporary hit and I always come back to my lonely and confused self."
