I'm not sure if I'll ever fully get over suicidal thoughts but I think once the world returns to normal, I'll give the gym a try. Maybe that'll help in some way. Cheers for the reply man, means alot."
SuicideWatch,fprcg39,t1_fphrzhc,1588850114.0,"No worries man, and yeah I can see how that would be hard to get around. I'm in a similar position of wanting to do something but having something holding me back. I guess all we can both do is hold out and hope that our persistance pays off in a way. I believe it will, but we all have to keep moving forward for that to happen."
SuicideWatch,fpgx2z7,t3_gdcrnk,1588611060.0,"Hi, I read your post and I'm sorry to hear that you're having a hard time. Having to join the army must suck when you have other aspirations and goals that you want to get to as quickly as you can. 
Maybe the army might be a good experience? I'm not sure which country you're from but I'm assuming it's a chance to meet people, work on your body physically and experience things that you might not have experienced if you hadn't gone? 19 is a young age for anyone but at that time it feels like you need to immediately chase all your aspirations otherwise you're incomplete in some way. But like the rest of us, your still evolving into the person that you're going to become, you're still discovering new things that you might want to pursue in life. The situation isn't great but maybe try facing it with a different perspective could be beneficial. I'm sorry if I've assumed anything here but hopefully you're able discover your positive qualities that motivate you and carry you going forward. If you ever need someone to talk to outside of the comments, I'm happy to have a conversation with you! 
Hopefully you will find a path that you're happy to follow and begin to feel better about yourself."
SuicideWatch,fntgeke,t3_g3sz2y,1587241122.0,"Hey man, I'll just start by saying thank you for the work that you've been doing during this crazy period. I can't imagine the stress and anxiety that yourself and others in your position must be going through. Viruses spread. You made a mistake but that's all just part of the sector you work in. I think it's difficult to fully shelter anyone from any of this. You can't blame yourself, you're doing your job as well as you can. Whether or not you made a mistake is something you have to accept and move on from. Forgiving yourself is such a big part of all of this, errors will be made just because it's so crazy for healthcare professionals. You guys could definitely use more support right now and you have a right to feel angry about that. Maybe allocating some time to your own wellbeing could be beneficial? Give yourself a set amount of time everyday to pamper yourself, however you choose to do that. I've written alot here but I'll never be able to fully understand as I'm not in that position but if you want someone to vent to at times I'll be around man. Thank you for everything you're doing right now and I hope you can start to be more forgiving towards yourself."
SuicideWatch,fnahb8s,t3_g0ie5n,1586797504.0,I'm sorry to hear you're feeling this way. I'm feeling similar to how you are especially with the quarantine (in the UK) going on. I can't tell you how to live your life but if you're looking for someone to talk to who doesnt have a bias then I'm happy to listen. It'll probably be helpful for myself aswell.
SuicideWatch,fjyv4vm,t3_ffhzm0,1583705246.0,"I'm there myself mate, I used to not really notice it but now these days, I mostly hear the voice that's telling me to end it all from waking up to when I'm falling asleep. Sometimes I hear the ""positive"" voice encouraging me to get out of bed or make sure I eat a meal today etc. But I find it almost weird to hear that voice now, as if I forget that I still have the capacity to be positive towards myself and my life. I guess right now focusing on that positive voice is the best thing you can do for yourself. Even on days when you would rather completely ignore it. It takes so much to gather the motivation to follow that voice, but even doing one positive thing for you will atleast have an uplifting impact on your mood, even if it's only for a second. And that's amazing about beating the cancer by the way, it must of been really tough. Think about all the obstacles you've overcome in life and use that to get you through the days when the negative voice is almost screaming in your head. Keep going, like the other comment, I'm around for a conversation if you need it."
SuicideWatch,fjr29sl,t3_fesfq0,1583580567.0,"Hey man, I'm sorry you're having a difficult time. It's a horrible feeling when you feel stuck and as if you radiate this negative energy which pushes people away. I'd say college/university is a stressful time for a lot of people and I'm sure there are others that attend the same class/school that feel similar to how you do. 

Have you tried talking to her a bit more when walking back to your cars together? Could be a good time to ask her if she wants to do something outside of classes? And I relate to you on the friends thing. It can be hard to meet people, especially when it seems like everyone already has their own groups. Clubs are a good way to socialise, especially if you're into casual exercise. 

If you need someone to talk to man, I'm happy to hear you out."
SuicideWatch,fjn8b2x,t3_fecegj,1583500989.0,"I think you can have a happy life, just like anyone else. Like yourself I'm quite a sensitive person and experience low points frequently. It feels as if putting yourself out there will inevitably lead to a negative. 

But life isn't determined, it doesn't have a fixed path. The amazing thing about life, is that if you keep putting yourself out there, you can adapt and begin to read situations more positively.

I don't think that many people are constantly happy, but I do think there is something or someone for everyone in this world which provides them with happiness. If you feel as if you need a chat, I'm happy to have one."
SuicideWatch,fjm8oup,t1_fjiv969,1583464209.0,"I see your point. Most people could probably assess how their life would go and the paths that are most likely open to them. I think the problem with that however is assuming you'll always be in the same mindset as you are right now. If lack of wealth was the cause of the void in your life, maybe the pursuit of it would bring continued dissatisfaction. However staying in the same place that you are currently will keep you in that mindset. Even if things don't change right away, just by pursuing that goal and actively trying to change your life could lead to satisfaction. People adapt to different situations. If you stay in the same place or don't try to go beyond your own boundaries from time to time, then there's no room to adapt. Whether you believe in the afterlife or reincarnation etc, death is final for the life we're living right now. Even if you believe to know what you'll experience in the next 5, 10, 20 years, that's purely based off what you know in the present. Change is inevitable even when it isn't obvious to us right away. The fact that everyone has this chance to find something or someone that gives them purpose. I believe there is value in that. Death maybe the best thing we'll experience or it could be the worst. In a way life is no different if you continue to invest in it. But with death comes a transition which you can't return from, atleast to the same life. I don't think the validity of your life is determined by the quality of your future experiences but having the belief and drive to keep looking for them. Situations and relationships can come and go. But those things that give us meaning always have a way of coming back in a different form if you keep allowing yourself to be apart of life."
SuicideWatch,fjgwv89,t1_fjflzgd,1583337114.0,"I'm new to reddit, this is actually my first comment. I read your post and agree with it to an extent, I've spent much of my life thinking in that way. Yet I think there is a purpose to us just by having the opportunity to exist and to decide what we want to be or even having the capacity for aspirations. I think having a specific purpose or ""destiny"" isn't very realistic for anyone. I think the single purpose that everyone has is the purpose of moving forward and discovering what lies beyond where you stand right now. Everything else after that is through you continuing to discover things that keep giving you the motivation to move forward. Some people will overthink this to the point where they question why moving forward is necessary if the path you're on will eventually come to an end, why bother? I'm not sure myself, I like many others have tried to take my own life using this reason. I'm still actively suicidal, but I can appreciate there is potential for something new to be experienced. Death is the biggest mystery in this world, yet maybe to abandon your own life without fully experiencing it is a wasted opportunity. As you said death is inevitable, so why be in a rush to die? I know emotions and situations play a complicated part in it all. Sometimes they cloud our judgement and force us into feeling like we have to leave this world immediately to relieve the pressure of what we're going through. Maybe sometimes it's for the best and maybe sometimes it isn't. I have no way of fully understanding another person's reasoning. But if you're still capable of independantly thinking and there is an absence of feeling content, then there's still a purpose for you. To find something that fills that gap which leads you to question the validity of your own life. Whether you choose to take this purpose is up to you, but I don't think anyone truly has no meaning in this life. In a way we are all tied together through chance and that gives us all an equal purpose."
