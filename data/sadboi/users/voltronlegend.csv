Anxiety,fm9x2me,t1_fm9vcy4,1585878520.0,"So I am to lazy to go through and find sources but I can offer my non scientific opinion based on what I've watched and read with this virus vs the Spanish Flu.

This virus is very unlikely to mutate that rapidly or more severely. This is not the flu. The flu mutates rapidly. It's why the flu shot is new each year. This virus appears to mutate much slower than that. Can't give you an exact time but it's a years process, not months. Also unlike the flu it's very unlikely it will mutate into something even worse or more severe. If anything it will mutate into something less severe in order to not kill its host.

Any comparisons to this and the 1918 flu are just scare tactics. If people talk about a second wave they likely mean that this thing dies down by summer time but picks up steam again in the fall. Not so much a more severe illness."

Often times they help people going through the legal process of immigration navigate the very complicated system.

My wife and her family needed one to assist with all the specific paper work and other necessary documentation needed. They're now citizens and have been for several years but going through that process would have been near impossible without a immigration lawyer.

If my diocese can help those who don't have the means to hire one navigate these processes I think that's great. Immigration is a long complicated and confusing process and if there is a language barrier it can be even tougher."
