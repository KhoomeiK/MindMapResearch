KerbalSpaceProgram,fq7729o,t3_ggz5v7,1589142621.0,Was sitting here just now drinking playing KSP looking to build a Minmus base and post it. Glad someone had a similar idea. Gave me a chuckle.
Cyberpunk,fnz2d1m,t3_g44z5l,1587384050.0,"Appears this post was quiet divisive. Obviously this is a temp hospital constructed to combat the pandemic. Obviously these people are what we should all consider heroes. Seeing as most posts on this sub are ""conceptual,"" why not post a photo with an aesthetic akin to many of the narratives utilized within the genre? While I agree this particular scene isn't portraying anything necessarily dystopian, the visuals can easily be imagined in a cyberpunk dystopian. I think people took it too literal."
KerbalSpaceProgram,fnvdl3w,t3_g3zrih,1587289291.0,Reminded me of [this](https://youtu.be/tYbwZfS3x10) starts around 2:00

Cringetopia,fmecthp,t3_fum5ef,1585999145.0,What tragic is the same inability to process her emotions that likely lead to that situation is the same thing keeping her in it and sabotaging efforts of getting out of it.
gifs,fjg1z7c,t3_fd4mqo,1583307987.0,Seen this video many times before but just noticed he’s wearing a lav/lapel mic. Was this filmed for something specific?
space,fhuz5i8,t1_fhuysv9,1581891664.0,Interesting! Any idea the capacity difference between Soyuz and Dragon? Starliner?
space,fhuvale,t3_f4qwjj,1581890498.0,What do the different colored tags signify? How was this recovered? The latest Soyuz recovery or an earlier one?

BPD,fg4ut6c,t3_ewsfsr,1580511575.0,Just learned about this recently: look into transference and countertransference in therapy relationships. May provide some perspective.
BPDmemes,ffuhwtb,t1_fft74m1,1580242304.0,It’s not easy but people say it works. I’m hoping they’re right.
BPDmemes,ff94mpq,t3_es4hx1,1579704729.0,Too relatable.
BPDmemes,fds6xg8,t3_emw7u1,1578695728.0,"This is what scares me. Whenever I start to improve or get over an FP, it feels much harder to work on myself, practice DBT, etc. Then months/years later I’m in crisis again and feel like I’m back to square 1."
Documentaries,fbho7qu,t1_fbhlt7g,1576878376.0,"Yeah, not entirely clear but the narcissistic angle leads to it being Luca. Also, all the puppet accounts he apparently had. I felt some of these ties weren’t really addressed, just left for the audience to conclude."
Documentaries,fbbwxqf,t1_fbbwjk2,1576710035.0,Good point. They brought that up but never addressed it. Unless I missed it?
Documentaries,fbbkgic,t3_echgl4,1576702319.0,Binged all three episodes today. What a ride. Great structure. Left with a few existential questions from the ending. Curious what everyone thinks.
videography,fb7j6j0,t1_fb78lsv,1576591610.0,Can you explain more? Just bought a Panasonic and want to know what to look for/be cautious of.

BPD,f0py66w,t1_f0o2ixd,1568850233.0,Yup. This is just how raw life feels with BPD. Thanks for getting me. I get you. Hope things get better.
BPD,eyk0me0,t3_cwytkx,1567133393.0,Yup. Whenever I feel myself starting to lose it I try to turn to mindfulness and DBT. I feel like a child trying to fight a grizzly with good intentions. The scariest thought for me is how easily I could really ruin my life if I don’t manage these emotions in the right way at the right time. It terrifies me.

As and INDYCAR fan having dealt with years of Verizon blackout, I was more than happy for a chance to pay for the content."
INDYCAR,er711wp,t3_c0lusj,1560563571.0,Any info on who produces this poster or where it can be found?
INDYCAR,er3ygu0,t1_er2wg4y,1560476222.0,"This is my feeling. The kid is pushing hard and a return could be one of the greatest storylines in motorsports history. A long, hard road for sure, but not out of the question."
BPD,er3y65j,t3_c08oio,1560475989.0,"Thank you. Currently surrounded by triggers, and nearing the end of a toxic relationship. Picked up smoking again and other bad habits and drowning in the shame of it all. The simple reminders like yours are a breath of fresh air."
