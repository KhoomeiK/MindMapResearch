Do you use protection? Condoms/other birth control?

Also, do you have limits to what you're willing to do?

What happens if a customer crosses boundaries of what you're comfortable with?

Reason I'm asking is because I've been looking into sex work. Almost entirely due to financial issues. I am in a country that it is not legal and I am also a victim of sexual abuse so I have triggers that make me feel like the job wouldn't be possible.

I have the utmost respect for you because I understand how emotionally exhausting it can be to be a sex worker. It is some of the hardest work out there. I hope you're having a good day and that you are happy."

rape,flmo05v,t3_fpjsyx,1585289825.0,"The best thing to do would be to report the assault to the police district where it happened. The district attorney will decide whether or not there is enough evidence to proceed with charges. Even if there isn't enough, they will have that info and if he does it to someone else who reports that will help that person's case.

Idk the laws in your state (assuming you're in the US?) but in Wisconsin, you have the right to have an advocate with you when you report. I highly recommend this, as reporting can be very traumatizing and they will be there to support you and make sure the cops aren't being total dicks.

AskReddit,fhdr6tw,t3_f2goj1,1581497523.0,"This made national news. (I actually looked up an old article about it to make sure I have all the info right.)

When I was in middle school, a high schooler was found to be a serial rapist. He was an 18 year old senior and was catfishing young teen boys online with a fake profile of a girl. He got them to send him their nudes, and then set up to meet them in various places around town (libraries, parks, etc). He'd meet them there and rape them. He'd tell them if they didn't do sexual acts with him, that he'd show their nudes to everyone at school. The way he was caught was that he sent in a bomb threat to the high school (as a prank I guess?) and they were able to trace back to his computer and that's how they found out about all the sexual abuse stuff. At least 31 of his victims came forward but there most likely were more, and he had 300 counts of child pornography on his computer.

As far as I'm concerned, he's still in prison. Was sentenced to 15 years and it's been about 10 now. I hope he's rotting."

It happens, and it sucks. But you'll get through it. The good news is you can enjoy sex again. It takes time and patience with yourself.

The first thing I'm going to recommend is to talk to your boyfriend. For me, it is absolutely vital that my partner knows about my assault. I have conversations with them beforehand about what my biggest triggers are and what to avoid doing. It makes a major difference. My ex used to remind me, even during sex, things like ""you're safe right now,"" etc. You basically have to reprogram your brain into believing it is safe during sex. Like I said, time and patience. And safe words are really important. I am happy to hear you have a trustworthy partner to help you through this time.
