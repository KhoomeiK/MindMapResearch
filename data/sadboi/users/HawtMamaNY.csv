If I was only diagnosed earlier I would have been treated and in college at the age I am.  I wish someone helped me.  I could hav√© had life so differently right  now.  I wouldn't change it but it would have been different.
bipolar,fn5n906,t1_fn5mxbb,1586669618.0,wait they don't know?
bipolar,fn5mpwk,t1_fn5lq0m,1586669166.0,What's worst being a burden or having an episode?  They would rather your taking your meds then trying to save them money.  If you can afford it...take your meds.  If not for you take it for them.  I'm a parent of older teens.  Of they needed their meds I'd never think it was a burden.  The illness is the burden.  PS It's me with the illness not them.  I take my meds everyday so they don't have to see Mom during an episode.
bipolar,fn5m6p2,t1_fn5lava,1586668714.0,"The list of side effects for that amount of pills are endless.  From the mind to the digestive system, muscle spasms, muscle weekends and tingling in your extremities.  I can't recall the name of the side effect but when I was getting Invega shots I had a side effect that made me pace all the time...oh akathesia.  Probably not spelled right but the moral of the story.  That amount or even a few pills could have so many side effects.  I couldn't stand the pacing so I changed to a daily dosage of something else."

Do you have any type of insurance?  Walmart does have quite a bit of lower cost antipsychotics or SSRIs.  Tell your doctor and they will figure something out.  Be honest with them.

Like I take a 3mg pill of risperidone bit if I know I'm to vibrating I can take up to 3 more.  I also take 3 or 4 mgs of Xanax depending how I feel.  I always take 200mg of Lamictal and 2 450mgs of lithium.  So that's 13.  When you get to a point of controlling your disease you know how to customize your dosage...the the amount of pills is not a shocker to me.

Unfortunately yes is some cliques it is looked upon as cool no matter what you have experienced.  I wish that group didn't exist.  I think Selena coming out is a double edged sword.  Is she doing it for herself or for her illness.  I think it's great she came out but you have to understand Hollywood shows you only what it wants you to see.  It is all placed there for a reason.

These are the kids of the future.  I agree with the idea of seeking out help because it is ok.  Yes people will seek help but I don't think it is because Selena has come out as bipolar.  It was already in the cards that it would happen.  A person who is really bipolar dosen't need Selena Gomez to seek help...talk about maybe but not the only reason.  If Selena never came out they would still be on the same path.  I just think it's too perfect to be reality like Hollywood is.  It's  perfectly pictured.  Perfectly placed."

Your feelings will be cast aside when she is in an episode.  You can not control it...she can.  Love her.  Drive her to her appointments.  Don't miss one!  Support her.  From the other side make sure you know the signs.  Combat the precursors and it will lessen the episode.  Learn her signs so you can make her aware that she's entering an episode.  It will only be to your advantage.  Good luck.  Take a real hard look at yourself and ask if your willing to experience being bipolar with her cause you will be experiencing it at the same time.

I can also agree with you about the sugar pill...I have ADHD.  Why does everyone else get to focus in?

MakeupEducation,fli4com,t1_flgussb,1585175071.0,Unfortunately you have to reapply sunscreen every two hours to be effective.  This is according to the National Cancer Society.  Basically it's a false sense of security but it's better than nothing.  I use Murad and it has a 50+ sunscreen in it and that makes me feel better about it.
makeupflatlays,fli3sb2,t1_flguzne,1585174765.0,Double Wear is not light at all.  It has great coverage but 8 hours later I have an oil slick between my brows like no tomarrow.  That's when I have to add a finishing powderüòü
makeupflatlays,fli3f1t,t1_flh3aaa,1585174566.0,I don't usually but one time I did and it was on point ü§≠ Depends on how dramatic I want to goüòÆ
makeupflatlays,flghdy3,t1_flgdfux,1585142611.0,I use Baked Balanced-N-Brighten Color Correcting Foundation.  I would not trade it for the worldüòâ  I started using a beauty blender instead of a brush and It gave me a bit fuller coverage.  I switched all my Laura Geller brushes to blenders and absolutely stunning üòÜ
makeupflatlays,flgg06s,t1_flfq2l9,1585141652.0,I love it.  These pigments stay true to color after you put them on.  Price was good @$10 or so.  I only use a few religiously but at that price it's worth itüòÜ
MakeupEducation,flebwhc,t3_fo939b,1585081406.0,It's recommended by the Skin Cancer Foundation to reapply sunscreen every two hours... so unless your applying it that often is say no.
MakeupAddiction,fle99jm,t3_fo3ifl,1585079977.0,"Best one ever...Laura Geller.  Baked Balanced and Brighten Powder Foundation...I use medium.  It has a swirl of multiple color tones so it makes your face just glow..No joke, I've worked out in this stuff and when I'm done I still didn't need a touch upüòÆ  I also love her swirl bronzer and blush too!"
