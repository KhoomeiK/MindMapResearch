AskReddit,fj0ucwp,t1_fj0q99h,1582907888.0,Thank you!
AskReddit,fj0hum9,t1_fj0ekwf,1582900321.0,Yeah I learned about it in DBT and it worked so well that I would keep breakable ice packs in my purse lol. Be out in public probably looking ridiculous but after a while the urge to self-harm went away
AskReddit,fj0d92p,t1_fj084d7,1582897032.0,Glad you find it helpful! Years of therapy had at least some good practical use lol
AskReddit,fj0cxh1,t1_fj06tlo,1582896781.0,People self-harm for a lot of different reasons but many times it's because their emotions have reached a height that they can't deal with. Basically if you place something freezing on where your pulse is (the neck is good) it calms you down enough to where you can think without your emotions leading. It's been a few years so I forget the science behind it. But aside from that it's an intense sensation so people who are looking to feel something can do so with the frozen item as well.
AskReddit,fj0b4ts,t1_fizzyev,1582895335.0,"Pretty great actually. Not freezing all the time, don't have fainting spells, my hair doesn't fall out anymore, and throat doesn't hurt anymore. Thank you for asking!"

AskReddit,fivilvp,t1_fiv9hgj,1582761015.0,Why is this a thing? Why does anyone do it let alone enough people for there to be a subreddit on it. Slightly disturbing
nextfuckinglevel,fivhla6,t3_fa1gnj,1582760439.0,That's fuckin awesome
AskReddit,fiv50ab,t1_fiv4ifz,1582753926.0,Wow it's amazing you were able to calm yourself down enough to think clearly. I'm so glad you got out okay!

At one point his eyes went black and his facial expression turned blank and he said ""if you ever talk to me like that again I'll kill you and make sure no one can find your body."" One of the scariest moments of my life."
AskReddit,fisvl5q,t1_fisinlf,1582694652.0,That shit is scary. Especially because you were alone. Good thinking on pulling it out.

It's not perfect because I still waste hours on reddit but it has helped me be somewhat more productive on days off."

AskReddit,filygio,t1_fikoe3p,1582513417.0,Congrats on 27 days!! I just did a year. Never in a million years thought it would happen.
AskReddit,filv9ru,t1_filqalw,1582511181.0,It's not harmful but like others have said you do develop a dependency for it. I took it every night when I had trouble sleeping and eventually it stopped working for me at all. I would say use any sort of sleep aid as a last resort for this reason.
todayilearned,filnzmp,t1_filgzk2,1582506125.0,I'm a fast reader and hear every word. I don't think I even know how to read without hearing the words in my head. The only time it slows the reading down is when there's a word I'm unfamiliar with and can't pronounce. I have to sound it out in my head in able to read it and move forward.
creepyencounters,fikb077,t3_f89mtt,1582476817.0,Glad you're okay! That could have been a whole lot worse.
AskReddit,fi4n19h,t1_fi3h4qk,1582144477.0,This comment is underrated
SlyGifs,fi20rmr,t1_fi207m8,1582068871.0,The clip is harmless but the point is that the behavior is inappropriate
SlyGifs,fi1sieg,t1_fi1ptmj,1582063904.0,"The point is that the boy should be taught now that the behavior is unacceptable, rather than ignoring it. Because it definitely has the potential to escalate as he gets older."
SlyGifs,fi1rvkm,t1_fi1hv5s,1582063547.0,Great point. Although I don't think any girl would go up to an adult male and kiss him. Kind of goes to show how children are taught at an early age what roles to play based on gender. In this case people thought it was funny or cute. If the roles were reversed people would be outraged.

AskReddit,fi0lf4j,t1_fi03j2r,1582039638.0,Legit didn't know what this was until I saw your comment and googled it. But I have questions. Is this supposed to replace toilet paper? Does it have a drying option or what do you do about being wet after? I'm very interested in this strange product now.
creepyencounters,fhzpjmg,t1_fhz8ziw,1582006669.0,I think it might be one of those situations where you have to be there to really be able to read the situation but it does seem like something was a little off.
