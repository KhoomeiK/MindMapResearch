BPD,flwqf17,t3_framg2,1585560971.0,With what's going on..it's been hell on earth with how shits going at home. Feels as if I'm a caged animal and some people have not been very considerate of some of my ticks... I had to leave today for hours before returning... to come to the same feeling over again is overwhelming.
