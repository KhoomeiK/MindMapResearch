I wonder if we’re going to get a song written by Minnie and a song written by Yuqi on the album."

GIDLE,fhac8rv,t1_fhab4zw,1581404219.0,"To add on: I think (G)I-DLE is so original and different from most groups in this current landscape, this could be a benefit of Soyeon being thrusted into self-producing for the group. She’s spent alot of time training and living with the other 5 members so she knows them and their vocal qualities really well and she always emphasizes that she aims to make songs that showcase I-DLE’s identity and each members’ strengths.

They’re still in their 2nd year of their career and I think they’re going to grow even stronger. Aside from Soyeon producing, Minnie (2nd Oldest, Thai Main Vocalist) has also produced 2 of their songs, has credit for the re-arrangement of the song Show, and is producing more in the future. Yuqi (2nd Youngest, Chinese Lead Vocal & Lead Dancer) has been taking production lessons and is currently working on a song that will be revealed in the future. (This is just my speculation but after seeing Miyeon’s guitar videos I feel like in the future we could see her produce a song or two). With at least 3/6 of their group passionate about making their own songs, I can see them strengthening their unique sound even further."
GIDLE,fhab4zw,t3_f1oiwy,1581403015.0,"In one phrase: (G)I-DLE is defining their own unique brand in the current K-pop industry, their songs are mesmerizing, and they have incredible potential for the upcoming years."

leagueoflegends,erpkuev,t3_c39zs3,1561120928.0,"Everyone expected the lineup to be Yoshino (TOP, sub until Zeros gets unbanned) - Levi (JG) - Kiaya (MID, laneswap from top to accommodate Zeros) - Minas (ADC) - Slay (SUP, roleswap as a duo with Minas). Then GAM pulls out this laneswap. I think that this could be an experiment but not sure if it will work."
leagueoflegends,erpk55m,t3_c39y6x,1561120283.0,Probably some lane swap shenanigans. Kiaya is normally their top/mid laner and is in the jungle.
