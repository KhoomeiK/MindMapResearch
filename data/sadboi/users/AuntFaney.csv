They are very religious and believe being sexual with someone before marriage is a hardcore sin. Then I met my husband, also would never tell them were having sex before we got married. They would die."

I hate underwear. Now you're a grown women, He's a grown man but he sure as hell has growing up to do. I think you need to seriously consider the pros and cons of this relationship. BUT BUT BUT As we all know, relationships are a working progress. If you genuinely enjoy his company and love him and think this is worth working through, then I wish you the best.  Heaven knows my marriage is a booty ton of work but I love him. Just try to be as mature in the conversation as possible. Be the adult. You got this, don't doubt yourself!  #goodvibesyourway"

AskReddit,fn7g8ex,t3_fzncbg,1586719711.0,"My brother took his life 8 years ago when I was 15 and he was 22. He was the silliest, goofiest guy and everyone loved his personality, he was so sweet and likeable. One particular thing he did that always makes me smile was taking my mom's olive oil at dinner and pouring it aggressively on her salad while yelling 'REBEL' whenever she told him he had to help with a project or chore or he couldn't stay out late with his friends that night. It made all of us laugh and is a fond memory for my family of him."
relationships,fn45tjq,t3_fz17aq,1586634650.0,"Bruh, she's overreacting. I've DATED  two of my (one was really close at the time)  friend's brothers. After I, myself,  broke up with them, we all still remained good friends. People put way to much drama into things and MAKE everything awkward and more complicated than it needs to be. Tell her that you think she is overreacting, it was consensual and you see no issue. Because fact is, there is no issue. She just has seen too many drama movies."

My Supervisor says this usually after being super condescending with ""advice"" or ""suggestions"" that either makes no sense or would make the situation more complicated. My coworkers and I just hate it when he says it. I've never heard the saying before but now it makes my blood boil."
relationships,fh0fo7o,t3_f0w05m,1581203420.0,"My take here is that you have been together for this long and he hasn't done a thing to help the situation whether it's a mental illness or not. I believe you can't spend your life waiting around to be happy. You deserve to be happy, and he's not giving that to you and doesn't care to give it to you from what it looks like. I think it's time to move on...
Good luck."

I had a boyfriend like this, and I'm going to tell you he ain't worth your time when he doesn't respect you. Dump his ass and never talk to those friends of his again. I know easier said than done, but I really wish I listened to that advise sooner with my ex, waste of my time.  Good luck girl!"

If you want an insane amount of orbs so you can summon on every single dinky banner, then you're honestly having the same attitude as an entitled rich kid that kicks and crys when they don't get what they want and APPRECIATE the bomb things you already have. Real world my bros, ya can't have everything. Plus. Idk why you would want everything anyway, a lot of the banners I don't want to even waste my time with (ex. Halloween banner)
You can't blame klab either, they're a company, they need money to keep the game going, if you want them to only give you free stuff, then you got no game. Cost money to keep a game going.

Her friends also sound like assholes gotta get away from people like that. I know breakups hurt a lot, it'll take time to heal of course but this is the right course for you not be with her. You'll find someone who will respect how you work and when you need to recharge. My sister is a huge extrovert and her husband is a HUGE introvert. They have the best relationship I've ever seen because they respect how each other cope with different situations and take time to really understand each other. Good luck in finding someone!"
