I stuge with a similar situation. I have “friends” but no a lot of times I’m still lonely. They’re more acquaintances minus a few. I can get dates and have sex but the connection just isn’t there and I feel worse after. My friends don’t get it. They don’t understand how I can be so lonely when I have family and friends.

I more mean I didn’t want to bring up any feelings or situations that may not be his favor. Such as if I was mad about something he did, it’d be - someone who loved me wouldn’t be upset about that. Or if I didn’t do something he wanted to benefit him - it was someone who loved me would. There were never apologies just - I’m sorry you feel that way but really that’s not what I intended so it’s basically your fault for having feelings and misinterpreting my actions and I don’t like being misinterpreted so I’d apologize. He is a narcissist and manipulator and moved onto the next one fairly quickly while still manipulating me to believe there was a future - “i wish things were different” “I miss you” “I don’t know what the future holds but maybe we will be together” all while he was already in another relationship.

He made these comments to be able to get me to do what he wanted. Things were good when everything was how he wanted it but if I deter from that - I didn’t love him. It was a way to manipulate me to get what he thought was best for him even if it eventually broke me down and I ended up depressed and suicidal and in therapy from it all."

He tried very hard at first to stay friends after I repeatedly told him if he didn’t want to work on things and fix things than there’s no friendship. He would still text me for quite some time. Just a few months ago actually about something I posted on social media where he is blocked from EVERYTHING.  He says he doesn’t care, but me ignoring him makes him more upset than me expressing my emotions.  He cares the only way he knows how - by trying to control the situation in his own benefit. 

I was naive to think maybe someday he’d realize and want to fix things, but he won’t and now I see that I never want to. I went on one date with someone else and realized very quickly how I should be treated.

I recently added a serum to combat redness and have noticed a huge difference on days I do and don’t use it. I got dr. Jarts. 

The best advice I was given was only add one new item at a time to give your skin a chance to get used to it and if it gives you problems it’s easier to know which product isn’t good for you. I just read online by googling basic or simplistic skin care routines.

My boyfriend and I broke up. I knew I couldn’t be with anyone for quite some time because it’s not fair to them. He started dating someone long distance within 2 months. I was heart broken and devastated all over again. To think I meant so little to him, that he was onto the next one basically as we ended.

I don’t know why he did it. I tell myself it’s because he was lonely and she was the first thing to pay attention to him. He was always the type that got a high off being liked, a lot of narcissistic tendencies. He never had empathy and doesn’t understand how I was hurt because what’d I expect? Him to stay single forever. Doesn’t change the hurt and I’ll never know why. He chooses to throw it in my face now how amazing she is. Which in the end, it won’t last. It’s a distraction from having to deal with his real feelings.

I do know why I didn’t date. I still loved him and I could never fully give myself to another relationship until I healed from that. He’d always be in the back of my mind. I don’t look at people and relationships as replaceable and that’s what I felt I’d be doing. I work every day to build myself into the person I was before I was hurt. Trying to get to know myself again. It’s not even worth online dating because I too only seem to find people unavailable or looking to boost their self esteem from someone else like my ex did."

BreakUp,f339j3p,t3_dfhg78,1570634358.0,"I’ve been going through this for the past year. I struggle. It’s not easy. But try and focus on yourself. It has been stressed to me so many times YOU DO NOT GET YOUR WORTH FROM OTHER PEOPLE. It’s a hard truth I’ve had to face. I tell myself they lost a lot and they just moved on so they didn’t have to actually deal with it and realize what they lost. There may come a day that they do, but there may not. But you need to do it for yourself."
BreakUp,f2svsdz,t3_de633l,1570387584.0,Letting it out really helps! I do this! He never hears it but it helps me and I hope it helps you. Also writing it helps me too.
Baking,f2oba7d,t3_ddu8av,1570325552.0,Looks amazing! Keep it up!
BreakUp,f2kjxz2,t1_f2hrtqd,1570286356.0,"I mean I didn’t think I was nothing but after this I felt like that. And then when he moved on so fast. Even if it was a long distance relationship and everyone told me it’s laughable and he was just lonely. Just felt worthless that it’s worth it to be with some girl across the country but not worth it for one that’s clearly in love with you and right here. It definitely shook me but that’s part of the reason I’m in therapy. I know I have a lot to offer, it’s just some days hard to see when I feel so shitty."
BreakUp,f2hotr7,t3_ddau7j,1570246260.0,All the time. Especially with him.
BreakUp,f2hnhe1,t1_f2hlknc,1570245771.0,Maybe not the upper hand but I definitely think I put more effort in and was more invested. Especially since he moved on like I was nothing.
BreakUp,f2hfy7k,t1_f2hdrny,1570243161.0,Not always that he’d leave but that I was making a decision that wasn’t right for me or us. That is push it too fast or slow that it’s ruin us. Whenever he was mad at me I worried he would. But not consistently
BreakUp,f2hczav,t1_f2hbfc6,1570242176.0,I’m sure you’ll find yours. Especially if it’s something you want to do. It takes a different path for everyone to reach it. Hope you find it! Thank you!
BreakUp,f2hblj2,t1_f2ha1gn,1570241717.0,"I just mean I was so focused on what the right decision was for us and our relationship. Like on any decision. Like when we fought or the decision to live together. I was so fixated that if I chose the wrong one he’d leave but in the end it didn’t matter because it ended anyways.

And you’re right, it’s just as much his fault we failed as it is mine."
BreakUp,f2hb3sm,t1_f2h7iir,1570241558.0,Thank you! That means a lot. Not many people take the time to see that and say that.
BreakUp,f2h633o,t1_f2h3f59,1570239866.0,Thank you. Just wish I could be there already.
BreakUp,f2h2j57,t1_f2gxzbu,1570238574.0,"This! I try to but most don’t want to listen anymore. I have my therapist and one of my closest friends but I also don’t want to bother them ya know? But I try. Honestly reaching out here helps. Even with strangers, knowing I’m listened to and not alone is entirely comforting and reassuring."
BreakUp,f2h2c1r,t1_f2gxdi5,1570238501.0,"That’s very true. It’s hard to understand someone’s pain when you were not in the relationship. My therapist always tells me it’s grief and it’s ok but I have no one but her to talk to anymore. It really is nice to know I’m not alone like I feel. For some reason, it helps. It’s comforting! Thank you."
BreakUp,f2h1z66,t1_f2gsoo1,1570238368.0,"I am starting to think that’s normal. To feel this way or at least it makes me feel less alone. So thank you for sharing. Mine hid it from me, for five months. So that made me even more upset."
BreakUp,f2h1nam,t1_f2gsfnp,1570238248.0,"That’s very well put. And I am terrified of dating again because of the possibility of it all falling apart. It’s so much effort to put in for it to just be over. My pain is missing him and our relationship and I have a tendency to look back and think of all the things that I did wrong. I spent so much time trying to figure out the right move that In the end it didn’t even matter. 

I hope some day to meet someone else. That helps forget he existed. But until I heal I don’t think it’s fair or possible to be with someone else."
BreakUp,f2gpixt,t1_f2gn3ap,1570233789.0,That’s exactly how I feel! Go to the bathroom or outside. Try not to let them know! Mine knows I’m still struggling and it’s awful. He gets an ego boost knowing he has a girlfriend and his ex is still hurting. I feel ridiculous honestly.
BreakUp,f2gmmcf,t1_f2gm2ip,1570232622.0,"I agree. I just know I’m not that strong. I’d cause a scene I’m sure! 😂 and look like a fool! But if you can keep your head held high, I hope you enjoy your evening!"
BreakUp,f2gm754,t1_f2gk7fp,1570232459.0,"I’m 30, he’s 35. His is a long distance relationship so everyone tells me it’s laughable and sad but it’s still real to them which hurts me. I’m in the same boat though, everyone is off in relationships and I sit at home with my cat baking treats for the people I work with since I don’t want to bother anyone. I can’t speak to him either. Just the thought makes me upset. Knowing he doesn’t give a shit yet here I am a year later. I just don’t know what else to do. I’ve literally done everything I’m “suppose” to and I still would work on things. It’s sad really."
