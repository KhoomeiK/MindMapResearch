Because I've seen that, and been on the receiving end, so many times for absolutely no reason other than the asshole wanted to tilt, and used the same disgusting excuse you just did, that weak people don't have a right to play a game they otherwise enjoy.

LoL and RL are both stressful to some people but as long as no one tosses the ""kys"" out, they melt my stresses away.
When I'm told it, I spiral, and when others are told it I tell the offending person to leave, and ask the person it's said to if they're ok. It's the most fucked up thing you can say.

Oh and the worst excuse I've seen for someone saying it is, ""I bought the game I can do what I want, it's just fun for me to make people feel bad.""

If it's just simple tilt stuff though like, ""git gud"" or whatever that's cool. One thing that shows a sad, yet laughable, lack of class, is when a match is incredibly close and someone on either the winning or losing side says, ""ggez"".
I always get a good laugh because it's ALMOST always the least useful person who says it.... except the idiots who say it on the losing side who clarify that if it weren't for their team... mhm."

Is a world war really something they want to be known for? In this social media age, it will be remembered.

They already are involved in a war, a smart, clean, war, where all the world goes to the victor.
They can't afford to take responsibility, because doing so wouldn't just set them back, it would take them off the board. They might just flip it if it looks like they can't play anymore.


If I were a world leader, I would suggest China either pay for damages [COVID19 related medical expenses, and deaths], lost wages, and stimulus payouts, as applicable.
That or have them wipe debts entirely.

As for the US government knowing, is that legally obtained knowledge?
Either way, in the future, there should be some sort of measures to prevent anything like this from happening again.

Is it still going on in China or did they already clear it up? If so, how, and if not, how bad is it?"

I would climb onto the counter and sneak bullion cubes, baby crackers, dry milk, powder jello packages, and then eat in the bathroom and drink lots of water.

I was tiny. I pooped maybe twice a month. I was always tired.

I've been in psych hospital three times, the first time I don't remember much, but the other two times I very much remember abusive staff.

Intentionally provoking patients so they can body slam them to the ground, acting angry while laughing and making rude comments. 

The last time, there was a lady who hated me. I don't know why. I fell, which I do sometimes even in my house where I know where I can brace when I get dizzy, and she said it was on purpose. Then she handed out peanut butter sandwiches and waited until I started to unwrap mine to run over and say very loudly, ""NO THAT'S NOT YOURS YOU HAVE A SPECIAL DIET!"" And then even louder, ""HE HAS A SPECIAL DIET!""

Before my allergies developed I loved peanuts. There's nothing special about developing allergies to just about everything. 

I told the social worker and she was upset and I never saw that nurse again. I think she got fired.
That social worker was so kind.

When I read what you said I can only imagine that's who you are like. A kind, caring person who protects from the bad mental health workers.

When I see how some mental health workers treat patients I've honestly wondered if they are patients that took over. Then I heard about the story about that through the movie about that a few years ago.

But I guess it's not about what you have. It's how you treat people.


The first time I was sent to a mental health hospital I was 5. My mom was negligent and my brother almost drowned with me in the room. She blamed me.

I've always seen those places as a punishment, not a place to heal. And she... always uses it as a threat. Don't talk back. Don't question her. Don't this don't that. 

But seeing the cruelty some have. Is that allowed?
I know it doesn't help. 
When I first saw them attack someone seemingly for fun I thought maybe they were testing the person to see if they had recovered enough to be released.

When I was about to be released the last time they asked if I have nightmares, if I'm scared, ect, and I said no. I lied which is something I don't like doing and I've been told I'm really bad at. But I was scared it was a test and they wouldn't let me go.


Based on what you said, I would trust you. 

I hope you don't quit. 
I understand if you have to for you. But please don't quit because of other people.
Knowing there's good people in the system gives me hope.

Right now I just see it as a place that abusers go to get paid, with a few people who actually care."

ptsd,fn24lio,t3_fyphuu,1586577697.0,"There's time when I just miss whole parts of shows and movies because it makes me think about similarities between things.

But... I've noticed these days people want to get rid of anything that might be a trigger to anyone. Every time it happens all I can think... like... there's a show called Stalker, it was on for one season, and so many of the bad guys reminded me of men my mom chose. It was definitely a big trigger show but it made me realize how important that stuff in media is.

Except in comedy. Like, Three Stooges, yeah it's old and maybe that's why I don't like it since it's more something my grandparents and great grandparents watched, but it just made me feel bad. It wasn't funny at all.

Home Alone to me was something between a nightmare and a desire... the home intruders were scary but Kevin getting to beat the villains was great and something I wish I had been able to do.

See... I think too much. People get angry at me a lot and say I read too much into things.

It's easier to get away from the real and imagine what could be than be stuck in real memories and get sad and angry.


That's why I play video games, I can forget the horrible things and just exist in games more than shows and movies because it's like being there rather than experiencing second hand.

Watching a show I'm always thinking what can go wrong, even in comedies, and they yeah often have worst case scenarios as comedy.

Comedy that is natural is so much better. And puns, play on words, references to pop culture, and that sort of stuff.
I'm listening to an audiobook and they very naturally referenced 'turn down for what' and I laughed pretty hard. It's Alumni - Divine Dungeon Series, in case anyone is interested.

I much prefer that sort of comedy. But... some people enjoy abusive comedy, as long as they aren't using others for that or because of that, I don't see the problem. But... for example I knew a kid who watched WWE all the time and he recreated the moves on everyone. I already disliked that stuff before I met him but I hated it after. They should just take it off air or make it for adults only.

Anyway... I was trying to get to a point but I got lost.

The point is, some triggers are important so others know what not to do.

Others are useless, serving no purpose. Like I said, wrestling should be banned... in my opinion...

WWII would be so far away from what all the other games were. It's either a gun game, or a spy game. Following what all the other games have been would be foolish.

I don't understand why those that don't believe even come here and say, well what you said they say. How are you supposed to prove by old stuff? I sometimes think for sure I can find, like an old FotL shirt I had in the garage, Shazaam VHS, old world atlas, ect, but even if I find the old stuff, it's changed. 

There's no physical proof.   


My grandma has been reading Danielle Steel\[e\] for as long as I can remember, probably before I was born? And the name on the books always said Steele. But none of her old books say Steele.  


Physical proof doesn't exist. If it did, there would be no Mandella Effect.   
Those that haven't experienced an ME... I don't know... everyone I've talked to about it, shown YT vids about different ones, think it's fake, think the YT videos are fake, that stuff must have changed, like the remaster of the original Star Wars movies.

It's like ghosts. Lots of people say ghosts don't exist. All they need to do is go somewhere with lots of paranormal activity and they'll either believe, or lie to themselves out of fear.  
What are ghosts? Memories trapped in limestone? Spirits stuck in a loop?   
Maybe we'll never know. But I imagine it would be easier for someone who doesn't have any ME experience and doesn't believe in ghosts, to realize that just because they don't believe in something doesn't make it real, by going to a real haunted site. 

Saint Joseph, MO, is pretty haunted, but I know there's plenty more places back in the Eastern US, and around the older parts of the world, that can prove to people.

Why ghosts? Because people who don't believe in ghosts and people who don't believe in ME's seem very similar. They don't believe in something because they haven't experienced it.  
ME's are easy to recognize for those of us who have experienced them.  
Ghosts are easy to recognize for anyone. You don't have to have memories from another reality to experience ghosts. Physically seeing ghosts in person is proof. Seeing photographs, video clips, audio clips, ect, from a second hand source is often times questionable, really easy to write off as home made special effects and audio editing.  
But for those that experience ME's, that's what it seems like when you see a clip or picture of how something is now.  


So that's why I chose to put ghosts and ME's together. The believers and disbelievers are so similar. 

  
I don't expect anyone who doesn't believe in ME's to believe in them if they see ghosts, just to understand that just because they don't believe in something doesn't make it any less real."

I have sever depression. I've thought about suicide every day since I was four years old. I was diagnosed with sever depression when I was five.
So while it is a stand against ignorance, I am worried that my stand will show me how little I matter, and it'll take me one step closer to actually doing it.
I thought about it as I thought of the response... but I was so mad I did it anyway.
The rules are simple, I have 2k karma, when I hit 0, I suicide. That's all they know. It's in response to a tweet that takes social distancing all wrong, punishes those that want to play together.
So as far as they know, someone's life is on the line... and maybe it really is. I want to live. I've lived my entire life thinking about how to end my life, but that's made me resilient. I want life. Sometimes things, memories, thoughts, and other people, are too much. I just hope that that community can show enough compassion to keep their up and down votes  alone.

I'm actually on disability.

I know I sound erratic but in my head it is a good show of how much compassion people can have.
