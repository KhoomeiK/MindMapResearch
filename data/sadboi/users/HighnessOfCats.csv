My Papa (grandfather) loves politics. As a child, I didn't understand why he loved watching the news every day and why he found politics so important. He's quite liberal, back in the 80/90's he fought for First Nations rights in the area we lived in, apparently to the annoyance of a lot of our family members (He's a white southern American that moved to Northern BC, Canada to create his own business). Most of our family is liberal as well, they were still quite racist towards First Nations individuals. Well, as he got older, he got more combative about politics. He drinks a lot now and that tends to play into how angry/combative he'll be. My grandmother and I often avoid talking politics with him because we're always wrong. However, my partner graduated with an Honours degree in Political Science and is currently in Law School. Whenever my Papa started to go on a train of thought regarding politics, my partner was amazing at handling the situation. He was the first person to stop my Papa from a full out rant. He was able to counter every point my papa tried to make. My grandma and I watched as we could see Papa's reign over politics talks crumbled before him.

For us, it requires a student to send their accommodation's letter to their prof/TA's that show the required accommodations. However, when doing it ask for a meeting with the instructor just to talk and let them know, beforehand, that your disability includes other aspects of it. I highly recommend going back and getting the updated accommodations list and fight for those absent days.   
Someone I know has ME/CFS, which makes them incredibly and constantly exhausted and in pain. Whenever they hand in their accommodation letter, they always sit down with the instructor and inform them upfront about anything in addition that might happen because accommodation letters can be quite sterile. Many instructors are good about it and understand, if you have an asshole, inform your disability counselor immediately.  I know someone who is autistic and a prof once told them ""ah well, everyone is a little bit autistic and labeling yourself as it, isn't going to help"".

I have bipolar disorder and I have a long term SO. He is fantastic, amazing, loving, and the best person I know. We've gone through a lot together both negative and positive. He has brought out the best in me and makes me want to be better. 

With that being said, you've only met him a little over a month ago. Relationships with bipolar people are intense and often very quick to get serious when we want it. You've experienced the ""fun, lovey dovey"" side of things and you're now experiencing the opposite, and it's okay to feel like you don't understand it. We a lot of times don't understand it ourselves, our brain's are misfiring and giving us some seriously intense emotions/states we are trying to control. It take a lot of time and energy. Depression is an extremely vulnerable state and he might not feel comfortable sharing that side with you yet. It does not mean he doesn't love you. Depression changes a person; the way they act, their ability to process events and their energy levels. He might be scared because he doesn't want to lose you. It might be because he doesn't have the energy to be able to be lovey dovey (check out spoon theory, it can give a basis to understand illnesses). 

As a partner wanting long term, the best thing you can do is learn about the disorder. Learn everything you can, when he's not feeling depressed, ask him about his experiences, his medications, what he does to stay stable, his triggers, etc. The more you learn, the more prepared you are. This is an illness, a disease, it will make you want to scream your head off, there might be moments you're questioning why you're dating someone with bipolar disorder, you'll want to argue with the illness, but you always have to remember the person behind the illness.

IAmA,flyq2yz,t1_flybjfz,1585606877.0,"Every brain is different and can have different side effects to certain medications. It's very possible that you experienced one of the more severe side effects that aren't talked about as often as the manic side effect of antidepressants for bipolar disorder. When I took my original antidepressant, I had every side effect under the sun with the exception of ""coma and death"". It may be unusual, but it doesn't make it impossible. I once had a professor tell me that ""all people on medications are experiments"". Comforting xD 

Basically, the way that a lot of these types of medications work is they target the neurotransmitters. Just going over the basic antidepressants: A SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) works for depression (and other conditions) because it causes the synapses clefs to slow down it's uptake of serotonin. Kinda like, serotonin is produced, but isn't automatically picked up by it's receptors, it's able to chill in the clef instead of automatically being transmitted through nerves. When done in the brain, it allows for additional serotonin to positively effect the brain. A SNRI stands for serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake Inhibitor. NDRI for Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (this is the classification Wellbutrin is under and it's the most commonly used antidepressant for people with bipolar disorder with hard to treat depression). They kind of all work in the same way by allowing the brain to take in the additional neurotransmitters. There are also more types, but these are the most common/well known ones. 

Mirtazapine is a tetracyclic antidepressants. I'm not going to lie, I'm not as familiar with this type, it is a less common one normally given to elderly individuals. I did a little bit of research to better give you an answer; it also blocks the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. The main difference, it seems, between an SNRI and a tetracyclic antidepressant is that an SNRI blocks/slows down the neurotransmitters from reuptake as the tetracyclic prevent or stop the neurotransmitters from binding. This then increases the amount of those particular neurotransmitters in the brain.

Like many psychiatrist that don't want to admit it, I'm going to say, quite informally ""your brain be wack"" xD. Medications can effect us all differently. I'm glad to hear that you're managing and doing well on your medications. My half-sister also has bipolar disorder, she can't take seroquel (quetiapine), which is one of my saving graces. She takes zyprexa (olanzapine); otherwise, we take very similar medications."

I have Bipolar disorder myself and it most certainly can trigger both. From personal experience, it caused severe ultra rapid cycling between manic/depression every three hours. It is highly possible for it to happen like that. 

As for why it happens, mirtazapine is a NaSSA. It's a more of an uncommon antidepressant. Without using a lot of biological talk, it affects certain neurochemicals in the brain that work for clinical depression; however, a bipolar brain doesn't match a clinical depressed brain. Due to that, it causes the brain to try to compensate... Which causes the cycles.

The piercer that I went to was a really old school piercer and did the ""don't fucking touch it"" rule, which basically meant, you don't use any saltwater and you don't touch your piercings other than when you're taking a shower, and while you're in the shower you run the bar throughout the piercing allowing water to get all the way through it. A few times, my piercing flared up and I used saltwater on it and they've healed relatively nicely.

Here is a textbook from 2019 called community Psychology. One of the biggest thing that this textbook talks about is how being on a lower socioeconomic status scale makes you more prone to many disadvantages later in life. Blue collar workers are much different than minimum wage workers. Blue collar workers tend to have full time jobs with benefits, they may not make the best money, but it is steady and possible to save some money. In comparison, minimum wage is unsteady, stress inducing, and extremely hard to save money. If someone has an unsteady job, any factor not planned for causes additional stress on the family. People lower on the SES are more likely to have lower life expectancies, worse health outcomes, and lower education prospects than individuals higher on the SES. Idk where you're from, but look up the social determinants of health. That's another great resource for understanding why people struggle.

This textbook discusses how stress affects the human body, especially when children are younger. Children put through higher levels of allostatic loads (stress) are more likely to develop autoimmune conditions, mental health, and additions. Children born into abusive homes are more likely to have increased neuro-connectivity in the amygdala causing a drastic increase in ""fight or flight"". 



I'm not saying that the original couple are likely to be abusive, but, financial troubles is a major issue for why couples break up. There is science behind that, I'm not even going to skim my textbooks for information regarding this. If you look up anything related to finances and couples, lots of results come up relating it back to it.

However, the way you reacted is very much YTA. Yes, there is science to back up your claims, but that does not mean you should ""play the devil's advocate""."

I have to start with the fact I had a supportive medical team behind me that allowed me to get one as young as I did. But the process there is most likely talk to your family doctor, get referred to a gyno, if they approve, get referred to another gyno for confirmation. Then get a surgery date. 

The survey day itself if different everywhere, but mine went like this: arrive two hours early before your surgery. No eating after midnight the evening before and only clear fluids (apple juice, black coffee or tea, ginger ale, etc) up to two hours before your surgery. You're going to be moved in and out of multiple rooms as they double check you and take blood, hook you up into an IV and give you sedation medications to help your through surgery. Finally, they'll bring you to the OR. 

The OR is what freaks me out the most. Here I am sitting on a table and all the doctors and nurses introduce themselves with me and explain why they're there. I had two nurses and three doctors including the anaesthesiologist. They put something in the IV that makes you extremely drowsy, it's like instantly behind it with an extreme body high (if ever had weed edibles might understand the feeling, it's just stronger). It becomes hard to concentrate, and they will put an oxygen mask on to make sure you are doing okay. 

Eventually, everything goes black and you're just out. Waking up is different for everyone, I have very negative experiences waking up since I wake up in a panic attack. This is a me thing though and nothing bad on the procedure. It's happened before to me.

I'm currently sitting 7 hours out post op. I have back pain (common side effect from the air they use during the procedure) and I'm using a heating pad on my incisions and a electric blanket on my back for soreness management. 

I wasn't given any type of pain meds to take home. Just take Tylenol when needed. No antibiotics. So, using heat currently is a good thing to help soreness and pain. It honestly feels like really bad cramps right now and that's about it."

Still to this day I refuse to shop there. Basically, when I was in grade 11/12 I went in there with my dad. I'm not going to lie, I'm a pudgy/curvy woman on the bigger side. At the time though, I was ranked second in the province I lived for wrestling in my weight class, yes I have fat on me, but boy, am I strong. I've also done multiple backcountry week-long canoe trips. I was looking at purchasing a canoe/kayak for myself (I had always gone with family and borrowed their canoes) and a specialized kayaking lifevest. I was looking around and there was an associate in the department I was in, she originally was helping another person, so I continued to browse. After she finished, I was the only person in the department and I was looking directly at her about to ask her for help (SHE MADE EYE CONTACT WITH ME) when a mother and young teen daughter came into the department. She turned around and helped them. Whenever another person came into the department, they were all skinnier than me, ""fitter"" than me, she helped them. She completely ignored me. Finally, my dad came into the department, he had been looking at something in another department. The next thing I know, she's beside us, asking if HE needs any help. I was almost in tears because of the way she treated me while I was there. I marched out of that store basically dragging my dad out I was so frustrated.

I told him what happened and he noticed how quickly she responded to when he came into the department area. I found out while I was talking to him that when he was in the mountaineering section, the man helping him started basically telling my dad (who's 6'3 (191 cm) and fit) that he couldn't be into mountaineering because he was too tall and didn't have the right body for it. My dad was buying all the appropriate materials to walk on a glacier with my Uncle, this sale associate basically talked his way out of making a couple hundred dollar sale because my father doesn't buy cheap.

&#x200B;

Same store, different sections, basically both of us were told that we weren't good enough to be there. That we didn't 'fit' the 'athletic' body type; therefore, we didn't belong. I ended up sending an email to MEC's head office complaining about how they treated me instore. They actually emailed me back apologizing and said that this was unacceptable; they told me that a memo was sent out to - not only the store I was at - but all MEC store telling the managers to speak with the sale representatives at a general meeting about how to treat all customers. They offered me compensation, I declined. That was my first experience at MEC, I've never been back. I was about 16 at the time and it really messed with my self-esteem.

My mom's family was not religious at all and my dad was the black sheep of the family. As a kid, I never realized how much my dad's family got into my head. How sheltered from sexuality I was. My father is homophobic and I'm bisexual, etc. The reason I'm bringing all this up, in particular, is that for me to enjoy sex or masturbation required me to ""get out of my head"" in a way. Unlearn what I was taught as a kid from the people I looked up to and try to look at what I wanted from this experience.
