GOTWinterIsComing,ethoar4,t3_cayoo0,1562821718.0,"1. Reduce the number of troops of your enemy. Anything is valid: Attack on hives, attacks on multiple castles (if he owns more than one etc)
2. If your enemy owns more than one castle, scatter him. Attack multiple castles while placing a small one on your target (let's suppose King's Landing) just to buy time after he gets it back. After imposing losses on your enemy and throwing them into disarray, r come back full force to your target.
3. Learn to buy time. Will diversify your siege tactics.
4. Only the banner leader needs to be real strong. Send your other big guns to place other kind of attacks to weaken your enemy.
5. Don't send more than 1 tier lower than your biggest troop tier to rallies. They will die quickly and lower your troops morale
6. Watch your banner leader commander military passive skills. Send your best ones.
7. Defending only really works if you're the stronger alliance.
