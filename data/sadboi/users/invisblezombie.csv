AskReddit,f1niv5y,t3_da5rws,1569618288.0,"Firstly, the referendum offered the public no options on what sort of Brexit they would like and it seems likely that many who voted leave would not support a No Deal scenario which looks like what we are heading towards.

Economic recession in the short term is bad for most people, increases in food prices will affect those worst off in society (in a time where use of food banks has only been increasing since Cameron took office) the same people who I believe were manipulated by the charlatans in office to achieve Brexit for their own economic gain. Furthermore, effects to public services will disproportionately affect these same people, and as the family of a cancer survivor I have serious anxieties regarding the accessibility of life-saving medicines of all NHS users in the event of a poorly negotiated deal or no deal at all, and hold ups at the border could literally cost lives.

Furthermore, as a British and Irish dual national of direct Irish descent, the issue of the backstop worries me immensely. The history of Britain and Ireland is exceptionally complicated, sensitive and intertwined. There is an exceptionally good reason why there is no hard border between the North and South, that reason being decades if not centuries of violent sectarian conflict which has killed thousands. I honestly believe that very few of those in charge of Brexit have any idea of the delicate nature of this environment and may re-ignite such a conflict either through ignorance or apathy.

Brexit is far more complicated than any of us realised, and whilst I respect the results of the referendum in 2016, I am seriously concerned for the economic health of the country, the physical health of its inhabitants and the possibility of war in Ireland and the division of the United Kingdom."
