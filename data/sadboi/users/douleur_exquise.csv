BPD,eqx9i9b,t3_bzequr,1560366695.0,"This thread is interesting, every single relationship I've been in has ended up with me getting used and abused and ultimately binned off when I'm no longer useful or someone better comes along

I turn into such a doormat when it comes to relationships / people I'm interested in romantically and I invest so much into them at my own expense usually. Sometimes I'm even conscious / aware of how badly I'm being treated but the carrot and stick approach sucks me back in and then it's back to square one again

Even after everything I still give them another chance or benefit of the doubt because I'm terrified they will leave so I will make excuses for their behaviour or tell myself that things might change / improve and I just need to try harder or do xyz

Not saying I'm without faults by any means but this narrative that everyone with BPD is a toxic abusive manipulator baffles me because if anything I've been on the receiving end of it rather than inflicting it on others"
