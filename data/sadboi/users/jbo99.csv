Why should some children have it worse? Well because unless you want to guarantee absolute equality on every dimension then some people are going to have it worse and some will have it better. The key is to raise the collective standard of living so that “worse” in the context of 2020 and beyond is still quite good in the context of all of human history. Capitalism has done a great job at this. 

And you didn’t say anything about child rearing but your implication is that differences between parents ought not affect children, correct? It would follow logically that in order to ensure equality we should mandate that parents raise their children identically otherwise some children could grow up with advantages that others don’t get."

Passing on exorbitant wealth completely untaxed is one thing but if hard working people want wealth passed onto their children for the sake of their wellbeing I think it’s a major infringement to deny this. Not letting parent’s quality be a differentiator in their children’s outcomes is ridiculous. If parents aren’t to affect their children’s life outcomes then it would follow that the state should mandate all parents raise their children identically lest one child be provided advantages through their education or personality traits that others don’t receive.
