SuicideBereavement,fmi6v68,t3_fvfx4x,1586103625.0,"without a doubt, it will be a big deal. read through a few of the posts on this subreddit and you‚Äôll see. forever and ever these people are haunted by this fact, that they couldn‚Äôt save their friend, or lover, or family member, or even a stranger. 

no matter how much your brain tells you nobody will care, they will. people will care

people bereaved by suicide will have to live with it forever, it‚Äôs not something that passes from one day to the next. they have lost not only someone else, but also a part of themselves. death is already painful as is, but suicide hurts all the more because there is the inevitable feeling that it might have been preventable. maybe if they had said something different, if they had noticed, if they had just smiled to that person a little more, perhaps today that person might still have been alive.

but no matter how much you regret and how much you wish you had done something differently, it won‚Äôt change that they‚Äôre gone, and that they now only live as a memory in their loved ones.

some would give up everything to talk to their best friend, or their sister, or their mother, or their father, or their brother, or their wife, or their husband, or their cousin, or their uncle, or their aunt, or their grandparent just one last time. one last time

it is absolutely soul crushing to hope for someone to return that you KNOW never will.

they still write to their phones, listen to their voicemails, look at their old pictures in hopes that it‚Äôll revive some part of them. they‚Äôll never feel their breath, or their touch or hear their voice or smell their scent ever again the same way.

people do care and people will care
