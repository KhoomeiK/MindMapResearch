Every few months i get a strong chest pain that goes up my throat i can also feel it in my back . Its not exactly painful but incredibly uncomfortably to the point that i cry. I have a high pain tolerance when it comes to period cramps or head aches . I rarely take any pain medication at all for anything unless it‚Äôs unbearable. Last time it happened was two weeks ago and i was very concerned i stayed up for two hours tossing around trying to get into a position that would sort of lessen the feeling. I didn‚Äôt find anything helpful online. This is the first I‚Äôve seen someone have a similar experience.

BPD,fabnow0,t3_e88o8o,1575925986.0,"I think it has to do with genetics and how good your metabolism is .

When i go too deep into my depression i loose my appetite and wont eat till i feel better and i end up loosing weight. Bpd may affect your appetite but I genuinely do think its just all genetics, how your body processes food ."

BPD,f9q9285,t3_e64j4f,1575557262.0,"In my relationship i try to communicate as much as i can . Sometimes it may come out wrong because 1 im a very emotional person and 2 i am very blunt . But i try to express myself as gently as i can with as much composure as possible . I used to become hysterical and snap at him, then communicate whats bothering me . That never did anything good except have him began to be bitter towards me but we are really trying to work through it. Things are better now for the most part . But when my boyfriend does not listen to what i say i quietly do the same back . ( i do not recommend this for every thing ) i dont do it often, only for the smallest things like if he is being distracted  and says things like ‚Äú mhm ‚Äú and is on his phone while im talking to him. I stop talking and do the same then in a few minutes he comes back to me and gives me attention . He likes when i give him attention even when he‚Äôs half appreciating it. So he notices when i am acting different and comes back to me .
If i were you i would do the same to him. Not call him, not give him attention since he isn‚Äôt been 100 . Get on the same level. He honestly doesn‚Äôt seem to appreciate you. Its hard to realize because you want that person you love to be in your life always. Your gonna want to call him and text him and your going to be wondering what he‚Äôs doing every minute of the day but you are gonna have to hold yourself back with all you got. Dont give in . This took a lot of practice for me. Literally almost a year of practice to not give in and just let things happen, then try to calmly react and communicate . But if this person does not react correctly then you are going to have to let them go. No matter how hard and painful it is."
