SuicideWatch,fpyv3un,t1_fpyrtqo,1589009495.0,You don’t have much to lose if you’re already feeling this bad. I would also recommend keeping a mood tracker while taking them (or you can start now to see your “before”) because change can happen gradually and you may not immediately notice. I like the app Daylio because it’s simple and you can easily see your progress.
SuicideWatch,fpyqcfj,t1_fpyp4bm,1589007864.0,"There are so many different brands out there. It’s important to find a doctor that you really trust so you feel comfortable switching if you want to. Many of them take some time to adjust to, but if side effects begin feeling unbearable, then definitely ask for a change. Lots of people take antidepressants and they work for a lot of people too."
SuicideWatch,fpyo3kg,t3_ggahoz,1589006992.0,"Quarantine sucks. If all you can do during the day is stare at a wall, then so be it. You’re doing your best right now.

SuicideWatch,fpr27js,t3_gez9g8,1588839773.0,"I am not a gay man, but for well over a year, I had a persistent fear of contracting any STIs, even when my partner had been tested. I was even worried about picking up spare change because I thought that I could get infected through that. I’d spend 7+ hours a day googling symptoms and risk factors and I went to the local health center and made them test me for HIV 4 times over the span of 3 months although I was very low risk. 

I had to go to a therapist because it was ruining my life. Later, I was told this (plus a combination of other things) was a sign of OCD. Obviously, I’m not an expert, but the way you discuss how you obsess over it reminds me so much of my own story. I know you said getting to a health clinic was a concern, is there anyway you could find a counselor or therapist in your area to specific talk about obsessive thoughts?"
SuicideWatch,fpmx2eg,t3_geb76s,1588743997.0,"And if you don’t like the person that you’re talking to, tell them that you feel safe to hang up and call a different line or try again later. There are some people who definitely should not be on those lines, but there are some that do a wonderful job.

Be careful about hanging up on them without saying anything though. It may be interpreted as intent."
SuicideWatch,fpf8r1m,t3_gczxgo,1588564534.0,"You’ve hung on for this long. Is there anyway you could hang on a few more years until you’re able to move out? When you turn 18 and leave, you don’t have to keep them in your life anymore. Block them in all areas of your life and don’t look back. It’ll be a little easier to heal without them in your life.

If you’re considering college, you can take out loans/ apply for scholarships and live on campus. Many colleges have free counseling on campus as well, so you could take advantage of that. I’m at home because my university is closed due to the pandemic, but I was very happy living on campus. I’m 22 and it’s like I’m 12 again with the shit they’re putting me through, but now I know what it’s like to not be at home and I know that I’ll be a little better when I can get out again. Of course, I don’t know your whole situation, but this is just a suggestion."
SuicideWatch,fp8yw5s,t1_fp5twsr,1588407925.0,"It’s nothing too exciting, but it did get me through the rest of that day.

I had gotten myself into a pattern of cyclical thinking where something had happened and I had to die because of it and if I lived, then my life would be ruined. I have really bad health-related OCD so I fall into these patterns often. I decided to call the hotline and basically wailed my problems into the phone to her. She asked the standard questions about where I was, if I had a plan, etc. I answered everything and she was calm and relaxed the whole time. I told her I locked myself in my dorm room and she asked if I had eaten that day.

No one on a hotline had every asked smaller questions like these to me before. I told her I hadn’t eaten yet and she asked if it was possible to get something to eat first and then suggested that I take a walk and a nap. At first, I was reluctant and told her that I was much too upset and that there was no way I could leave my room. She gently asked if I could just try these things for a little bit and told me that she could stay on the phone as long as I needed or that I could call back later if I was still feeling bad. 

I thanked her, took her suggestions, and did not feel a need to call back that day. She was so personable and kind. I definitely wasn’t cured of suicidal thinking, but I was able to get through the rest of my day because of her."
SuicideWatch,fp4yvbt,t3_gbb9oo,1588311118.0,"I was hung up on before. The guy said he didn’t know how to help me and that it was time for him to clock out. I feel like he could’ve transferred me over to another person or something, on the bright side, I’ve had really good experiences as well."
SuicideWatch,fp108if,t3_gagt4k,1588221033.0,"I feel exactly the same right now. I can’t even leave my house without feeling panicky. It was bad before the pandemic and it’s gotten even worse since I’m not forced to go anywhere. I can’t sleep, eat, or think without being consumed by anxiety about something. My heart rate pretty much stays over 100bpm at this point. 

You are definitely not alone in this and feeling this way."
SuicideWatch,foy0aoo,t1_foxzeny,1588161980.0,"Well there you go! I’ve been with guys who came too early, couldn’t keep erections, couldn’t come at all, etc. Honestly, I was just worried that I wasn’t sexy enough for them and was SO relieved to find out that it was an issue on their end and not mine. They still enjoyed it though which is what really mattered. 

Some of the best sex I’ve ever had was with a guy who had issues getting off and could only get off in one position. He was so good in many other ways that it didn’t matter at all. He always listened to me and was fantastic at reading my body.

There are so many ways to pleasure a partner that don’t involve penetration and like you said, there are pills to help you with getting an erection. Be honest with your partners and listen to what they’re wanting and I promise it will be okay. If it is psychological like your doctors say, maybe gaining confidence in yourself will help."
SuicideWatch,foxv1mj,t3_ga6wpx,1588157252.0,"Do you still enjoy sex/ have a decent sex drive? As a woman, I can’t always stay wet during sex which sometimes has to do with my medications and sometimes it just doesn’t happen. I keep a bottle of lubricant next to the bed and just tell guys that my heart is willing, but my body doesn’t always cooperate. 

The guys I’ve been with were more worried because they thought they were doing something wrong and were relieved when I told them that I loved it and it was just my body not cooperating. Lube makes things more comfortable anyway. If you explain that you were injured, I don’t know how somehow could hold that against you."
