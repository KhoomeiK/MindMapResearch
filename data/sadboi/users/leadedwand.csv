“But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.”  -luke 19:27

""Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth; I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.”

 “and if you don’t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one. It is written: ‘And he was numbered with the transgressors’; and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me. “ (very dubious quote as it’s thought he might have been trying to get arrested by making it seem like his men were armed, it was used to justify some crusades)

“Put your sword back in its place,” Jesus said to him, “for all who draw the sword will die by the sword. 53 Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels? 54 But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?” (supporting quote for the above statement)
