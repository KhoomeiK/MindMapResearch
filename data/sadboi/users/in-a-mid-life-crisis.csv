depression,fqn48nh,t1_fqmt8l3,1589488401.0,"It’s a strange feeling. It’s like you’re physically present, but your mind and soul are someplace else. I guess it feels like a waking dream, maybe? Nothing seems real and it’s almost like you’re a mindless drone being operated remotely from somewhere (and by someone) else. I call it “being on autopilot”. I’ve only experienced it a few times, and it’s usually happened after a trigger or traumatic event.

Last time it happened to me was the day after I met someone from my childhood. I was bullied a lot, but this guy was always nice and cordial with me. We’ve been friends on Facebook for a long time and I thought I would try to focus on the good people from my past. I met him for coffee one day and had a pleasant time. I woke up the next day feeling absolutely horrible, and then... nothing at all. I was like that for several hours until I was able to gain control of myself again.

It’s scary afterwards because you’re aware that you were capable of doing anything without fear, remorse or even consequence. You are completely void of emotion and have no empathy or moral compass.

We’ve all had that one girl/guy we’ve had our eyes and heart set on, only to be rejected by them. That’s life, dude and we all experience it.

There’s nearly 8 billion people on the planet. Half of them are women. Your chances to find one who’s perfect for you look pretty good, my friend.

There used to be a YouTube channel called “Simple Pickup”. It was started by 3 average looking guys (one Vietnamese American, one Indian and one white) who would go out and use cheesy pick up lines, or dress up like nerds, use Pokémon references, etc and get girl’s phone numbers. The videos were 100% legit and they developed a huge following of people like yourself who were inspired by them. They later launched “Project Go” which helped guys with their confidence.

They’re all millionaires now, and they have all went their separate ways in the past few years, but some of their videos still exist on other user’s accounts.

Their story is interesting: the Vietnamese and Indian actually met on an online forum regarding meeting women. They met and became friends. They would encourage each other to approach women by playing a game they created called “Go!” It went like this: They would go to a public place. One of them would point to a random woman. The other had to approach her and talk to her. If he hesitated, even for a second, he had to do something embarrassing that would bring attention to himself. The point being: you can either feel embarrassed by making a fool out of yourself doing something dumb, or you can approach a girl and possibly get her number. You’re going to hear “no” a lot, but that’s ok. Think of the “no” as a resistance that will build up your confidence. It’s like lifting weights; the weight is “resistance” and you’re essentially breaking down your muscles and that’s why they hurt so much the next morning. BUT! They’re developing calluses, and becoming harder and stronger! The more you keep at it, the more you’ll see results.

I (on the other hand) was a skinny, unkempt kid with cowlicks and crooked teeth. I was bullied a lot and had zero self esteem. You speak of being the “last one picked”. I wish I was “that” kid. He got picked, at least. I was just the last man standing who went to the team with less players by default.

Anyway. My cousin would go through girls the way some go through underwear. He admitted to me that he had what he called a “disease”. He only wanted the thrill of the chase. He only wanted to go after the girls that were playing hard to get, but once he wore them down, and they confessed they were in love with him, he would be done with them and would move on to his next conquest.

It drove me absolutely mad. I mean, I loved him, but I was really depressed how he could have most any girl he wanted, but I couldn’t get a single girl to give me a second look.

The irony: my first girlfriend was a girl who dumped him for me.

Having intimate feelings for a blood relative is definitely a taboo, especially in Western cultures. It goes against what’s deemed as the social “norm”.

If you wait to make your move, the more emotional attachment you’ll have with the girl and if she plays the, “I like you, but not in that way. Can we just be friends?” card; you’ll be devastated.

Alternatively, if you’re upfront and honest from the start and you crash and burn; no loss. It will suck, but it will only be temporary because you didn’t make any sort of connection with her to begin with.

Think of hitting on girls like a workout. It’s going to be difficult at first, and you’ll feel figuratively “sore” at the beginning, but you’ll be stronger the more you keep at it. You don’t develop a six pack over night. It takes daily discipline. Remember, practice makes progress.

I’m not a hockey fan, but I do like the quote. Lol

Good luck!

Edit: these guys use to have their own YouTube channel. None of their videos exist now on their current site, but can be found elsewhere. These are 3 ordinary guys. In this video, they’re dressed up like nerds and say nerdy type stuff to women, and they still manage to get girl’s phone numbers. They insist confidence is all that’s needed. Enjoy!

bullying,fo8ki08,t1_fo8fu3c,1587598330.0,"I wouldn’t say “nightmares” per se, but I definitely had some that I found disturbing.

I have a wife and daughter. I think they’re the reason I’ve made the attempt to get better. I don’t know how many years I have left (I have several health issues) and I don’t want to be remembered as an “old, bitter alcoholic” in the end."
bullying,fo8fofl,t1_fo8drkb,1587595658.0,"I didn’t tell my teachers, either.

I reluctantly told my mom early on that I was being bullied, and she called the school without my knowledge to report it. I was pulled out of class one day and reported to the guidance counselor’s office. I refused to name names, and I suffered in silence for the remaining duration.

Repressed memories began to surface in my mid-30s. I developed multi mental health issues (i.e. depression, anxiety and panic disorder) as a result. I also developed a drinking problem as a means to cope.

I was diagnosed with CPTSD last Fall. Therapy has helped me a lot, and I’m proud to say I haven’t had a drink in nearly 2 months.

That being said, I am truly sorry for what you’ve went through and what you’re going through, now. I can relate with you 100%."
socialskills,fo8dio6,t3_g5y1fp,1587594492.0,"Just be yourself. You’re not going to be liked by every girl anyway, no matter how you act. (I want to emphasize the word “act.”)

Everything comes down to law of averages: the more women you strike out with, also means the more luck you’ll have finding a girlfriend or dating partners.

Just be direct with women regarding your intentions. It’s better to be direct than attempt to come in “under their radar”. Don’t make the mistake of, “I’ll be her friend first, and then make my move at a later time.” This may eventually work, but wouldn’t it be much easier to find out from the start if she’s into you? Besides, a woman may be turned off if you do this because you are subconsciously communicating that you’re not very honest. (This is how guys end up in the “friend zone” because they make the mistake of initially coming across as just wanting to be friends.)

If you like a girl, tell her. If it’s mutual, great! If she doesn’t reciprocate, move on. It’s better to find out ASAP rather than prolonging the agony of, “I like her. Does she like me?” You’re just torturing yourself and wasting time.

If anything, people tend to respect others more when their being honest. Plus, you’ll always be comforted in knowing, “Hey! I tried, at least.”

Live and love unapologetically.

bullying,fo7ycao,t3_g64isr,1587586651.0,"I feel for you.

I experienced the same bullying in middle school back in the mid-80s. It really shaped the way I saw myself for decades. I didn’t finally accept myself until my early 40s.

I wish the channel was still up, but there was these videos I watched on YouTube of these 3 guys who would do really stupid things in order to get girl’s phone numbers.

They were totally ordinary guys, who were all introverts as children and were never good at social interactions. Especially when it came to women.

Two or the three original guys met on an online “pick-up” forum. They got together and started experiencing ways to find the courage to approach women and conquer their social anxiety, thus instilling confidence in the process.

It was hit and miss. They crashed and burned so many times, initially. However, they soon overcame their shyness and their self esteem was altered in a positive way.

They’re all millionaires, now, and are in relationships. There’s only one original founder remaining and he changed the channels content. It’s unfortunate, because their videos were genuinely inspirational.

I am married, so I wasn’t interested in meeting women, but their philosophy was very sound. It made perfect sense. I applied it to my own life, and I have to say it really changed me and the way I now perceive myself.

I still have demons regarding my bullies, and I’m still an introvert at heart, but I am completely comfortable in my own skin, and have accepted me for me and that has given me the confidence I didn’t have the majority of my life.

I don’t know how much you can relate to this, or if this even helps, but I hope you eventually find peace.

Best regards!"

I’ve made attempts to contact past bullies in recent years, and most have chosen to ignore me. I’ve had a couple of apologies, but I also had one tell me to “get over it”.

You have an excellent opportunity to make amends to those you’ve affected in a negative way. A sincere apology or even acknowledgement of your actions to those you’ve wronged will go a long way in the healing process, and perhaps bring them one step closer to having closure."

bullying,fjt917f,t3_fewaq3,1583605282.0,"I agree with changing schools if possible. There are some schools here in the US that cater to kids who face daily problems like bullying, domestic violence in the home, etc.

I was bullied extensively during middle school, and I did very poorly in school. Fast forward 30+ years later and I have been diagnosed with CPTSD.

I have recently learned that your Hippocampus is the main learning center of your brain. It also controls the amount of cortisol your body makes. When you’re being bullied (or experience any type of trauma for that matter) the amygdala (fear center) kicks in and hijacks your Hippocampus to produce more cortisol. This is known as “fight or flight” mode. When that happens, the learning part of your Hippocampus is under-activated, thus cognitive learning takes a back seat and you have a lot of trouble trying to retain information and make new memories.

Ask anyone who has ever been robbed at gun point. I guarantee the description of their attacker to the police is not 100% accurate.

That being said, you’re not stupid. You just need a different, safe environment to learn.

I’ve been at my job for 19 years. I had this younger guy as my supervisor one time, and he would always tell me to do something as I was either already in the middle of doing it, or about to. I would often remark, “You don’t need to tell me what to do. I already know what to do.”"

bullying,fj8g30y,t1_fj8chva,1583112583.0,"Honestly, I’m at the point that I no longer care if I get apologies or even acknowledged. It’s enough for me that I made a valiant effort to confront my demons.

It’s a sad reality to accept, but I stopped expecting most of them to do the right thing.

The first person to apologize came after I tagged them on Facebook in a drunken rant. (I’m not even friends with this person, and how I was able to successfully tag them remains a mystery to me.) They apologized and seemed sincere. I replied that their apology might have meant something to me if I didn’t have to solicit for it 30 years later. They agreed. 

We chatted on Messenger after that. I eventually gave her credit for being the only one who at least responded to me up to that point.

I’ve had two people block me after I confronted them on Facebook.

One of my bullies is a 3rd grade teacher at a nearby local school. I lost count of how many emails I sent him. I never once got a reply, and I know he received them.

I guess what I’m trying to say...

Don’t allow your happiness depend on the expectations of past bullies developing a conscious. 

There are some rare cases when I’ll hear about a former bully seeking out their victim to express remorse, but that doesn’t happen very often.

I just had to accept the fact that most have no memory of what they did to me, or have no remorse, or are filled with guilt but can’t bring themselves to admit to me (or themselves) that they were such horrible people at one time. It’s cognitive dissonance. No one sees themselves as the “bad guy”.

This is no way a means of me saying “get over it.” I’ve been in therapy since October and it has helped, but I am far from “over it”.

As I said, for me it is enough that I have reached out to these demons and let them know badly they’ve affected my life, both then and now. If I get an apology, great. If not, big deal. They at least know how I feel, and that will give them something to think about. It provides me with a little satisfaction, anyway."
bullying,fj85cli,t1_fj82p6m,1583105499.0,"I think it was more of a “nervous” chuckle as Lance (the bully) was in denial. You can even hear him say “unbelievable” under his breath.

I have contacted Mr. Barrett and we have talked on Messenger on several occasions. He told me that he didn’t originally intend on calling Lance out by name, but wanted to address school bullying. He was hoping Lance (as a former bully) would recognize the problem and implement changes for the good as his position: superintendent of the school system.

Greg told me that while he was in the middle of re-telling his experiences, Lance began to smirk/smile, and it just rubbed him the wrong way.

Maybe he’s (Lance) still a jerk after all these years, or maybe he crapped his pants when he recognized Greg and became very nervous. (Thus the smile and laughter.)

He was forced to resign shortly after the story went viral. There was even talk about Lance and the school system talking about suing Mr. Barrett for defamation. (That never happened, thankfully.)

Lance has yet to admit or apologize for what he did, according to Greg.

I can’t really tell you what’s best for you. Me? The chances of me running into anyone of my past bullies are pretty much nil. I haven’t seen them in over 30 years, so I doubt I’ll ever see them in the future. 

That’s why I decided to reach out to them; it doesn’t matter what they think.

Please keep me updated and let me know if you ever need a word of encouragement! Best of luck to you!

bullying,fj7xl7o,t1_fj7427l,1583100492.0,"That’s a tough one. Being “successful” can be interpreted in different ways.

I think some of them have possibly been financially successful, but most seem to be happily married with a family regardless of their occupations. (I absolutely loathe seeing their profile photos of their dumb, happy smiling faces.) I guess the fact that they’re so happy (as I still feel miserable regarding how they treated me) really gets me down sometimes.

I do know some went on to college and got degrees and others went on to vocational trades. I didn’t even finish high school, so my lack of higher education has prevented me from working anywhere other than “service related”, jobs, so it bothers me that most of them  have been more successful than me in that area.

I recommend you look up the name “Greg Barrett” on YouTube. Look for a video of a man addressing a school board meeting. This man inspired me to reach out to my bullies. I shared a very similar experience as he did. I’ll post a link here if Reddit allows it: https://youtu.be/Pmuw1E0D6CM

Thank you for sharing your experience. It really, truly helps to know I’m not alone. I sincerely hope you can find closure and finally be at peace with the past.

bullying,fj6l3m4,t3_fbs5lg,1583074656.0,"I was bullied in middle school 30+ years ago. I’ve made attempts to contact my past bullies in the past couple of years.

Warning. You’ll be opening a proverbial can of worms.

I’ve had mixed results. I’ve had some completely ignore me. I’ve had one tell me to “get over it”. 

I didn’t graduate, but I would’ve been the class of 1990. There is a Facebook group that was created for reunions. The 30th is happening this summer.

I’m still Facebook friends with a few people from that time, and I saw some of them were tagged in the group regarding the upcoming reunion.

In a drunken stupor, I went on a 500+ word diatribe.

Three women expressed their sympathy (but I didn’t have problems with them back in the day).

I did receive a message from someone who was tagged express sorrow for the way he treated me. There’s that at least.

I’ve only had one other person apologize, too.

In my experience, there’s going to be people who have no memory of what they did to you, or they have no remorse. It’s also possible that contacting them will inflict guilt on their part and they will not respond because of it.

I’m not sorry for attempting to contact them. I may have not quite gotten the results I hoped for (i.e. apologies or acknowledgement), but I feel like I finally stood up to them after all these years, and I have found some closure in that.

I’ve made attempts to contact my bullies and tormentors from 30+ years ago in the past couple of years.

Some of them haven’t replied. 

One (who did) had no recollection. He told me everyone has problems in life and that I should “get over it” and seek help if I couldn’t do it myself. I responded with, “would you say that to a girl you raped a long time ago when she confronted you years later?” He blocked me.

I have been seeing a therapist since October. She told me there’s a good chance that some of my bullies have no memory of there past behavior.

Even though I know that’s most likely the case, I still let it bother me to a certain extent. I find it unfair how I am left with the horrible memories which have caused me depression, anxiety, panic attacks, CPTSD, etc issues back then and even to this day, yet they live with absolutely no guilt whatsoever as they have no memories of what they’ve done to me.

I saw a post on Facebook regarding an upcoming 30 year reunion being planned. I did not graduate, as I feigned sickness so many times to avoid going to school and I got so far behind as a result. 

I’m only aware of the reunion because I am still friends with some of them and I saw they were tagged in these posts.

Long story short: I went on a diatribe Christmas Eve. I posted somewhere along a 500+ word rant. I was upset, yet I refrained from being overly aggressive and vulgar. I was civil, yet went on the offensive at the same time.

I received a few replies, and a few texts from Messenger. The post was deleted a week later as I believe it hit a nerve.

It was a low point for me, but I have no regrets. I wanted and more importantly “needed” to say what I did.

One good thing came out of it: one of the texts I got was from one who said they don’t believe they bullied me, but admitted to not treating me very nicely. He apologized for it.

So, some do have memories, but they’re probably somewhere in the back of their mind.
