depression,f75e9v6,t1_f74je5n,1573414278.0,"'If you go big or go home, you will always go home.' fucking hell dude that describes me perfectly. I need to write that down. I always wanna do too much and end up not doing anything at all haha.

Say what do u think is the best way to remind yourself of that? Cuz I'm aware that i need to take it slow but i always forget that and completely forget to use the breaks, which ends up in a crash. (mentally speaking)"
depression,f74cevm,t1_f7420w3,1573400553.0,"I consider myself to be a social cripple as well but the only way to get better at it is to talk your way out of it ain't it?

And thanks so much man! I definitely need those well wishes cuz what I'm saying and my actions are very different but i just need to stick to my words and do this thing. :D"
depression,f73zvap,t1_f73tg46,1573396652.0,Yeah pretty much. I'm terrified of failure even tho logically it's not that bad plus you can always learn from it. But that fear keeps me from advancing in life and makes me stay in my 'safe' spot where I'm unhappy af anyway. But it's great that you that you started trying to get better! I've been at this for years as well but I'm pushing myself to do better now. Let's do our best!
depression,f73pxyn,t1_f73lyky,1573393876.0,Thanks dude. I'll take your advice. I'll go to the gym today and try to beefen up enough to psychically kick depressions ass one day. Small steps right?

depression,exlruoe,t3_cth66r,1566418298.0,"I'm 24 myself and I've given up. I have a shit job that pays and a place to live, it's enough. I've tried for a long time to fit it but recently I've given up. People are too much, it's scary, so fuck that shit. Sometimes i have enough energy to try to get better, and always fail, thus repeating all over again. The only reason I'm not ending it yet is cuz we're all gonna die eventually so no need to rush, might as well live for a change."
depression,etrwlmn,t3_cd0hjp,1563130738.0,Wow i thought i was the only one! That's kinda relieving but also sucks that so many people are affected by this :(
lonely,esftygp,t1_esfn1m2,1561934942.0,People are surprisingly oblivious sometimes aren't they? I once was sitting on break at work for like 20mins and only once I was about to get up I realised the guy next to me was crying. I didn't know him so i had no idea how to handle the situation. I guess most people would just leave you alone because they don't want to embarrass you or smth
lonely,esfgz4u,t1_esfgomi,1561925903.0,Oh no haha. How do you hide it? I work in a factory so I go to the freezer and pretend it's just my eyes watering from the cold xD

depression,ero5v68,t1_ero4eox,1561069036.0,"Oh no, I don't think it's more serious than that as my breathing goes back to normal if someone talks to me and makes me snap out of it, or after my low point passes. But thank you for your concern."
lonely,ercbubi,t3_c197mh,1560708008.0,Same. I get an adrenaline rush when I post any sort of comment lol
