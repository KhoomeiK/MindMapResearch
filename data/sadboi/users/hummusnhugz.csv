BPD,f5983wz,t3_dn97ho,1572075709.0,"Those attempts you’ve taken against your life shouldn’t be seen as a failure. You are worthy of this life and the love you continuously give to others instead of yourself. I know I sound like another ‘it gets better’ trope - but, it truly does. I would not experience all the blessings I have received if I left this earth. I would not of had the opportunity to see my brother get engaged or taking my rescue cat home after adopting her, head banging at my favorite artist’s concert, standing up for myself for the first time, growing in my talents, making friends and finding a love that lasts. 

This pain feels like it will last forever. It is a black tunnel with only a shroud of light seeping through. When looking at the light infiltrating the crack it is impossible to tell if it is 2 feet or 2 miles away - it feels like the latter, but I promise you, you are closer than you think.  

This life is not easy for this community, but I promise you, it is worth it.

If you want someone to talk to, my messages are always open."
BPD,f597px9,t3_dmzqd6,1572075092.0,"I feel the same way with poetry. I love it so much yet when I’m too weak I cannot survive the words or enjoy it.

BPD,f597nce,t3_dn37s0,1572074979.0,"I understand what you’re going through. I started splitting on my amazing partner and I don’t know how to get back even though our relationship is now steady again and I do know I love him. 

I’ve always been on the ace-spectrum but sex positive (meaning I’m willing to have sex with my s/o and I’m not repulsed by sex) to the completely opposite end of the spectrum where even the thought of it bothers me. Sometimes I think that the combination of my pills (mood stabilizers) with my splitting amplifies it’s affects. It does not help that he is a very sexual person.

I do not know of a clear way to navigate this, but speaking with a therapist along w this community is a good start. Ask your therapist what helps ease splitting and how to reconnect trust within a relationship, and write down triggers you notice that make you split (other than the obvious like big fights) and where this splitting stems from.

The situation we both are in is tough, but I believe through healing we can get return to a balanced love for our partners. 

Do not give up on the relationship just yet - this is something that can be resolved even though it doesn’t feel like it."
