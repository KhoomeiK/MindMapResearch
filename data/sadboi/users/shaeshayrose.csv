The more comfortable she is the less painful anything will be and hopefully not at all. I would check with your fingers, you'll be able to feel if she is wet and relaxed if not you have some more work to do. You seem to have the right attitude by asking and not wanting to hurt her. You may have to be really patient but remember vaginas can have babies, you just might have to work on expanding her to fit you. Keep in mind that if she does feel pain it could lead to fear which you really don't want. You may not be able to be in there for long but don't get upset with her, be understanding and loving and positive that it will get better. Edit: feel free to ask more questions"

You need to do serious damage control before she has insecurities about this that could effect her adult sex life. Ask your husband how old he was the first time and how scared he was because of his religion? Ask him If he walked in on his son would he have felt the same?  he would have probably congratulated him...I honestly would be packing up my things because he's only going to get crazier the older she gets which means she'll start hiding things and probably start using a real penis not in the safety of your home...

DNA matters

So don't try and convince me that

I won't end up like you

Because when it comes down to it

We are the same

And I'm in no position to believe that

I will turn out to be different

So rest assured

I can fight where I come from

Until I'm blue in the face

But no matter what

I am you

And I'm not going to pretend

I am so much different

Because whenever I look in the mirror I always think

Well I turn out like you?
