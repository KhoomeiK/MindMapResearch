I do also plan on getting into HD video editing and encoding so I was hoping with 32GB of RAM and a crazy proc I would be ok for the next couple of years or so. I was looking at a 1660 Ti or 2070 super but I would have to shell out another half stack to get a monitor to benefit from the proc gpu combo. Not an issue I just don't want to run into the problem I had last time where my DVI monitor did not work with my DVI-D plug. Wound up getting a decent 27 in monitor 1080p for a good on sale price and also it worked over HDMI which I got for cheap too. I had a 1060 3gb card and it was fine but that was 2017. It is now second quarter 2020 and I was waiting or hoping to get a good deal on a i7-9700k or 9800k but I don't think I need that. 

My old pc I was thinking when covid lifts just taking it to a computer shop for a diagnostic. See if I can pay to replace the board if they determine the issue have them deal with it and gift the pc to my friend Jen who would love this PC. Hers is a all in one from hp that suuuuucccccccccckkkkkkkkksssss

I checked all connections. My mother board is the type that allows the mouse and keyboard to still have power when the machine is down so I am thinking it had enough voltage in it to shock the system and kill it.

Creatine does not lead to male pattern baldness, that is from Testosterone and genetics. My dad is bald and so is his and I am losing my hair in the front. I only have been using creatine in the last two to three years or so. 

&#x200B;

You can start creatine supplementation now but to be honest with you it is almost a waste of money if you eat a lot of meat on the keto or carnivore diet. It does help for that last rep or for endurance however. People are on the fence about it but I do supplement with it regardless of what diet I am on. 

Creatine also helps if you are in a fight as well. First hand experience, I knocked this punk ass bitch down several times and taunted him. He got up swung at me and missed horribly. Down he went. ""Your kung fu no good!"" Everyone laughed at him. Good times. 

Do light weight squats even if it is only bar with 25 or 45 pound plates. Keeping your legs sharp is great because your quads digest a good amount of calories in a day. You can do light weight dead lifts too, this is a full body taxing workout. Even if you are only dead lifting 185 pounds, you can do 5x5 and do cardio this way. With creatine I got up to 385 dead lift but I do it 5 sets of 1. Pick it up put it down rest. repeat another 4 times.

Your brain thinks it is starving so it advertises you eating sugary foods in order to survive the upcoming famine. Your evolution comes from Homo habilis and further back, but with modern agriculture and you can also probably roller blade to a super market to get food. With food being so readily available you are not burning calories to hunt or fish. 

Your brain has no idea what kind of shape you are in. The part of the brain that wants sugar, also wants alcohol, cocaine, cannabis, nicotine, heroin, playing the lottery, or having any other dopamine blast. Your brain is designed to go out and find shit that is addictive. Just drink some tea, have some keto junk food and ride it out. You will be glad you did.

tl;dr your brain sucks just ignore it"
leangains,fmb5asm,t3_ftq81k,1585918711.0,"You only need carbs to gain weight. There is an entire sub dedicated to weight lifting and being ketogenic, r/ketogains there is also r/keto and r/carnivore where people just eat meat drink water and get electrolytes such as salt, calcium, potassium, and magnesium. 

I stopped eating carbs for months, walked, weight lifted for 5 days a week. I went from 295 pounds down to 225 fairly quickly. I am back to 295 on Standard American Diet. My medications have to be taken with food otherwise they do not catch. My gym is closed, I have no freezer space... the excuses go on and on.

&#x200B;

You can eat your maximum amount of carbs, which is 20 grams 10 to 15 minutes before a 45 55 minute Power Lifting barbell session such as Strong Lifts, Starting Strength or whatever. This is a cyclic keto diet. However I got to a 300 pound squat, 185 bench, 175 row, 135 OHP and 385 dead lift not eating carbs and felt fine. If I needed a boost, black coffee as preworkout, if I was feeling sluggish I ate butter and bacon for a snack and felt better in 20 minutes or so. Hell you can even drink olive oil, coconut oil or avocado oil too. 

&#x200B;

There are a million or so recipes on the internet where you can do alternatives to carbs. Almond flour, coconut flour, coconut flakes, eggs, cream cheese, vanilla extract, sugar free sweetener, and peppermint extract all are good ways to satisfy the sweet tooth without eating food that just makes you fat and fart."

BipolarReddit,fmb2y1b,t3_fu2efy,1585916860.0,"I would suggest the r/keto ketogenic diet. It helps keep salt out of your brain, and helps your brain run on ketones made by the liver instead of running on glucose. It helps with the swings and you will lose weight if you are starting to gain from psychiatric meds. I am on Geodon and my fat ass sleeps twice a day and I have to take the meds with a minimum of 500 calories in order for it to catch. 

I would also recommend barbell training with Alan Thrall, Untamed Strength on youtube, Ketogains or even Stronglifts5x5. These programs are helpful to put lean muscle on so you will feel better. Not to mention you get to eat more in a day if you want. 

&#x200B;

You will be bipolar for life. There is no escape. I do use cannabis at leisure and I also avoid alcohol.

meat,fmax7qb,t3_foysbx,1585911368.0,"A carnivore or ketogenic diet is way better than a vegan diet. There are more vegans that stop being vegan and then eat meat for health benefits than there are carnivores that stop and go vegan. 

Cow Farts release methane but this is a natural process that does not really impact the atmosphere as much as carbon dioxide, though the scientists are working on a way to make cows fart different gasses other than methane. 

If you load up on plant based protein, carbs and vegetables you will fart more than someone on the keto or carnivore diet too, so there is that. 

Vegans are like Christians, they feel that since they are vegan that they are better than you and there is no other diet to be a better person than vegan. Carnivore and Keto is more like Satanism, it is more about individualism and being a better person for personal needs than it is herd conformity. Keto and Carnivore have better health benefits than eating a vegan diet. I know a few vegans that lift weights and they do not look like they lift weight and can't do barbell exercises, more like light weight cardio isolation exercises. I do not know any vegan power lifters. I know plenty of Power lifters that are keto, r/ketogains for example. 

Personally, I prefer keto but with out a freezer to use I have to go to the food store like every three days to get meats, cheeses and what not. With my gym closed because of covid, I am doing maintenance calorie eating and I am trying to preserve my muscle mass.

Alternatively you could do vegetarian. Cheese, Milk, Butter, Fish, Veggies, Nuts, Carbs, Eggs, Fruits, Grains, bread, and shit like that. Vegetarian is like being a Catholic, Jesus but with ""false idols"" that are wrong in the eyes of Vegan Christianity. 

Please for the love of ""god"" eat meat, you will feel better and be more healthy assuming you do not eat carbohydrates and get 70% of your TDEE calories in Fat, 20% in Protein, 5% or no more than 20 grams of carbs. I usually eat a Wawa (Philadelphia deli that has an assortment of foods and the such, it is like a 711 without the grime) packet of honey 20 minutes before a 50 minute barbell session. enough carbs to give me energy but I have also gotten through the session with black coffee."

You are highly compatible with the sheep of 1991 and rabbit of 1987. Avoid snake 2001 1989 snakes will coil around you and squeeze you to death. Ox 1997 1985 is too stubborn to put up with your bullshit and the monkey will bring trouble. 

&#x200B;

You have an easy love life except you are prone to marital strife regardless of who you date. Pig people are usually happy and jovial and giving, people take advantage of this leaving the pig pissed off and criminally mad at the world. Pigs love cooking, even if you only know how to microwave stuff, you will over eat but always in good taste. Pigs live for fine dining fancy cigars premium wines, champagne and expensive cheeses. Pigs help themselves to their friends stuff and are glad to let others do the same, though no one likes this at all... ever.

&#x200B;

Pig women are artistic, creative, and know how to have a good time. Pig men are loving and jovial. Pig dating another pig will be fine until they move in together. Both hate cleaning and rather ignore the responsibility. They live in a pig sty. Only a handful of pigs actually clean. Pigs are either super tidy or messy and disorganized. nothing in between.

&#x200B;

Taurus is compatible with Virgo and Capricorn. I think you are female so look for a Significant other born 1991 for best pick. 

&#x200B;

Sheep of 1991 is indecisive creative natural caregivers that love nature art and enjoy luxury. Sheep's thoughts are a ball of yarn. Get them a magic 8-ball to make decisions. Sheep is good with kids but get one that does not drink alcohol because sheep will tend to drink too much too often."

Do not date a man born 2000 or 1988 you two will fight constantly. Rat 1996 is a good match, and it is a stable union with a fellow of 1985 or 1997. Sheep is your enemy. 1991.

Ox is stubborn, they give solid advice and are excellent medical staff, business managers, and anything that lets them be the boss. Ox people work harder than anyone else and expect the same in a partner. You are a pain in the ass to date because you expect your man to be like Link in Legend of Zelda, he has to get the master sword, silver arrow, the triforce defeat gannon and what not in order to qualify to date you. Ox women like to decorate their homes with nice stuff they worked so hard to achieve. You need to let your hair down once and a while and have a good time otherwise you will have a boring life. Ox and rooster are a good team, so is snake. Your ultimate pick is 1977 but he is like 42 going on 43 haha. If you want kids I would suggest a rooster or a snake. Never the sheep. Pig 1995 is too jovial and fat for you, dog will bark at you, rabbit is ok but you two are better off with other people. Tiger and Ox will kill eachother at first glance avoid 1998. Monkey 1992 will  not stick around long enough. Horse of 1990 2002 will go their separate ways rather quickly.

Water sheep pout when they don't get what they want. Sheep are indecisive love art and dream of marrying a wealthy person to sit back and enjoy life. Their projects are a work of art.
