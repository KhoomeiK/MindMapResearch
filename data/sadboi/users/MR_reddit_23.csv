Thanks for all the suggestions, and yes I have spoken to professionals and done a lot of counselling but it always went the same way I would start to feel better , stop my sessions , then relapse go back and repeat , but sadly they won’t extend my ‘program ’ so sadly I’ve lost faith in doctors/therapy etc, but srsly thank you for taking the time to reply and I’ll try the suggestions  and hope to see some change."

depression_help,fdb85nt,t3_ekg93r,1578254817.0,"Hey 
I think I understand your pain , 
And I know it’s shit and it seems like it doesn’t end and u have no one , but ppl does care , and if u haven’t already talk to ur bf try to explain what’s going and remind him how much he means to u and hopefully he’ll u defy and stay and support u

As for missing lectures and over sleeping drinking eft,I suggest getting external professional help if u are not already. And look after ur roommate who tried to OD but don’t let it control u , try find a way to organise ur life that benefits u. 

As for your parents, if they do love u they would never say ur a failure and although they maybe be disheartened by any bad exams , they should still live u 
Maybe try having a in-depth conversation w them listening to their concerns while voicing your own , without it becoming a screening match between you.

And remember, their are ppl here for u , friends , family , uni staff  or even this sub 

Stay strong it gets better"
depression_help,fdb59u2,t3_ekgwbh,1578253969.0,"I would suggest having a conversation w/ her explaining what u think , and listening to her thoughts and not dismissing them or getting upset or angry , cuz that can sometimes make them feel isolated and alone , try to connect and understand as much as possible then put forward any suggestions u have whilst listening to hers"
depression_help,fdb4sat,t3_ekhx0f,1578253818.0,"Hey , 
I feel I can help w what’s happening , 
The feeling of emptiness is likely emotional exhaustion and possibly anxiety. I can suggest taking some time off the daily grind take. Break do something you genuinely enjoy , and see if u feel anything , 

As for the dark thoughts 
Just remember people love u even if it doesn’t seem it ,  
And things will get better eventually if u can just hold on , and I’m as well as the whole sub is here for u 

Hope u feel better soon"

depression,f9vlkqs,t3_e75d8p,1575673453.0,"Hey ,
With the feeling of emptiness and loneliness here’s some advice 
Try and find a hobby you enjoy and find people who also share it , then you can have a meaning and more a sense of self worth. And I know it is way easier said than done but it’d you put in the effort it can really pay off 

As for opening up I can tell you from personal experience that your mum does love you and it may be hard to get her to see your side of things but maybe a long calm conversation with her might help you out.

But just know that everything gets better and you matter a lot to a lot of people so just stay safe and wait out the storm maybe get some professional help of you feel you should . 

P.s I’m sorry I’m not very good at advice I’m just trying to say that you matter and everything is gonna be ok"

depression,f9vkpt7,t3_e74uyo,1575672845.0,"Hey ,
It’s pretty normal to feel bad after a thing like this 
But always remember YOUR FEELINGS MATTER 
And however you feel is important. In my opinion I think you should be straight with this girl and your friend tell them how you feel.

As for the smoking and drinking, I can’t really tell you what to do, but I think you should know that there are loads of ways to get over a event like this 
Sometimes it’s finding a new hobby , getting back into an old one 
Seeing friends new and old 
Get into something you enjoy and although it’s way easier said than done try and slowly move on 

And also if you feel depressed or low ,it never to talk to someone weather that be a therapist , family member or friend. Sometimes just having someone to Vent 2 is a real help with this kind of stuff 

Remember,
Your loved , cared about and you and your feelings are important and you deserve to be happy. Slowly move away from the pain and it will in time get better 
Stay safe. :)"
