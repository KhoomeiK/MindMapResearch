My days vary, a good day is a day I appreciate because I can get things done, socialise and stick to routine. A mixed day can be anything from feeling Ok to then being triggered by something (everyone is different) and that can cause anxiety, i sometimes have panic attacks. Bad days can be anywhere from being upset to being on the verge of a self harm relapse feeling full of self hatred,fear and self frustration. I used to have extremely bad times when I was suicidal or dealing with frequent suicidal ideation but medication is helpful with that. The best thing you can do is just listen, if you're far a way a text, consistency is key.  When people want to support a loved one a lot assume that they have to do big gestures to show support but in reality small little ones mean more - like someone bringing me a cup of tea means the world if I'm having a bad day and can't function properly. 
I think the fact you want to help and understand is great, you might have already but if you look into dbt it can explain things from a treatment side and that might help you link it to people's experiences here?"

bipolar,f806u83,t3_dxzomz,1574121856.0,"medication is I'm on lamictal about 12 months now and whilst it has helped my cycles, it has really impacted on my memory when in a depressive episode, I try to do what I can to help with the brain fog but sometimes it's worse than others, perhaps your medication is also a cause of your memory problems when you're in a depressive episode? It sucks"

Asthma,f7azopl,t3_duz84v,1573547707.0,"I dont have suggestions as I'm sort of in a similar situation, I've been told before that my chest was clear and dismissed when I mentioned feeling like I had a chest infection, yet hours later I was bringing up phlegm again so I don't understand why my chest can sound clear and then not. There's another condition I read about that mimics asthma symptoms and asthmatics can be misdiagnosed (not saying you are) but it's also able to Co exist alongside asthma, it's called vocal chord dysfunction. Definitely get a new Dr if you feel you're not getting the help you need at the moment, they can prescribe things but you know your own body and lungs."
Asthma,f7azg9z,t3_dv6hv5,1573547358.0,"I noticed if I'm overwhelmed and stressed it can trigger chest tightness for me, it took me a while to figure out if it was my asthma or anxiety, mentioned it to my doctor once and he said intense crying etc can trigger asthma symptoms because your body is under pressure"
Asthma,f76y6dn,t3_duk10t,1573438881.0,"Bring it with you but take preventative measures, wearing a thick scarf around your neck and up on to your mouth will warm the air before you inhale it so you won't get that sharpness. When it's winter here I sometimes take one puff of Ventolin if I feel I'm heading towards symptoms and the weather isn't helping but I don't think you should take it unless needed, or if you feel a flare up is likely having spent time at your destination, Just keep it with you :)"

Strange but liberating I guess!"
