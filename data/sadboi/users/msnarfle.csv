Creation,ew7kxuf,t3_cmutw9,1565193399.0,"I am a firm believer in my Faith in God the Father, His Son and Word made flesh; Jesus Christ the messiah,  and the promised Holy Ambassador,  Christ's Help; The Holy Spirit. 
I believe what we call science is a hair thin sliver of the shadow of the outer layer of understanding of just how awesome He is.
We can slightly grasp this. He literally spoke the Word and made the whole process start, which we have a city sized machine under Europe somewhere that has a circle top that is shooting molecules at each other trying to recreate the same things.  Basically they are gonna blow a whole in the side of the Earth. And failing. But, the vast differences in the two are enormous.  

I have a truth. Which is GODS glory is shown through Salvation for the Gentiles plus the kept promises of the Jews and people unbeknownst to themselves through their lives in kindness and God raining His blessings on the Just and the unjust. If we spend so much time on the creation belief of this doomed Earth then we will miss the way to the new one. 

We literally waste our time with this in the regard that it is turning people away from salvation.  That's not good.

So I feel compelled to intertwine the beliefs. There was a teaching I sat in for and the teacher concluded that the word ""day"" had been on the translated list,  few times. And basically what he said the word honestly means, an undermined amount of time but it was complete. So, it makes sense if the Earth was denser and the atmosphere perfect and the mists that kept everything perfect obscured the perception of the days and nights, since there was never a clear blue day or a storm of any kind, so they would have never known. 

So, if the beasts of the earth were created it could have taken millions of years. Or maybe man just did. But to be honest with that knowledge people are like ""no no, they are the Devil!!!
No I'm not saying that God could not,  like some kind of restriction on the being who did the creating. GOD CAN DO WHATEVER.  So believing this makes Gods work actually more intimate because he would have taken millions of years sculpting us uniquely starting with. Adam.  The breath of life could have been awareness for Adam. I have a document for this. If you would like to read it in full I will make it happen for you.  I wrote it. It's called.

I can hear me screaming for them to shut. That final time, wishing for it. But my face does not appear. Just this empty. Then I smile, nice and appealing."
AskReddit,ew3ktbf,t3_cmgdvx,1565084016.0,"The recent discussion??? Lol. 
Look. School shootings were bound to happen. The concept of killing is not new, the children killing themselves and each other is not new, mass murder is not new. Death and killing is not new........ here... Africa recruits the children of villages by making them kill their mothers in front of their houses. If the kid doesn't they usually are castrated and left to bleed out, as early as 9 years old..... China mass murders are done with knives with just about as much frequency as America with guns. Police in America have killed more unarmed compliant victims than the Iraq war little Bush started. 
Video games have a point.  These dont. It's a lack of moral control taught in the house. This is not a gaming, tv movie, or book issue. It's the system. Excessive fear, Shaming, bullying and bigotry are taught by the parents. They send their kids away for more hours than they see them and then they ignore or shame them constantly. They are taught moral compasses and how to hate and defend themselves against other bullies in school. They are demanded of to listen to useless information while expected to cope and deal with a world gone to hell. 
They are subjected to comedies that berate and mutilate and if you get offended your a ""snowflake"" so their hearts have hardened.  They are racist and dont know why. 
They took the Savior away a long time ago, was replaced by a false perception of who/what God was then mocked that and mocked them. Taking hate to the next level as God is love  
They don't teach them anything except how to regurgitate useless things that do not aim for the betterment of life, rather just their wallets.
Racism is still a thing.....
Guns are not being treated like a tool they are demonized,  there is too much fear around them and not enough actual education. 
Faith is considered unintelligent 
Intelligence is the only thing they grow.
Violence is ok ash long as your angry in the agreed ways.... violent things are never ok..... ever
We elect racists and billionaires... 
We hate each other. 
The problem is deep inside the human core. We are horrible creatures and this planet deserves to implode taking all of us with it.....
School shootings are not uncommon for us. School is a warzone now and we should literally stop the system all together and open up trade school and social and mental health classes and if you end up needing more education for academic purposes,  then go to college.  
We should have a law. If you say something racist,  ANYONE! ANY RACE AGAINST ANY RACE! ANYONE AT ALL THAT ISNT THE SAME AND YOU LAUGH, BULLY, STEAL FROM OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT IS TRULY EVIL. JOKING OR NOT. SHAMING OF ANY KIND, Ic your bullying behavior is noticed by anyone,  or you threaten other humans believing that you are superior in any way or fashion. You should be sent to a hospital where you are required to stay in the psychiatric ward for 5 days where they set you up with outpatient treatment for your bigotry and if you did something violent you must work with the state and your parents must also go through therapy with you and the parents, also they must go on the local tv news station and record an official statement that declares you're racist and abusive and the consequences of the actions is declared in court and shared with the area that it was affected. 
Parents should watch their own children and their individualism is not a super good concept,  but they were able to make it work.

Morgellons,evr49dp,t1_evp22o3,1564701445.0,"This will be an extremely long response but I hope it helps in as many ways as you can make it work for you. Please take the time to shift through this information.

Do you feel like spider webs across your mouth and eyes at times,  especially when something profound or really important is being said and/or shown to you?
Do you ever get (ewe) little pubic looking hairs appearing randomly on your forearms, collar bone area, creases or armpits,  crotch area that are not attached to your skin, are not your skin? Do they seem to get thinner or dissolve or become transparent once removed from the surface of the skin either under or just on the top? 
If you grab at the crawling and feel as if removing a flea or spider and keep your fingers pinched then turn the (possible) transparent ""bug"" upward keeping a tight pinch on it, does it look like a bug or squid like vapor writhing around trying to escape?
Have you taken any stimulant medications or on recreational illegal stimulants and/or gone without sleep,  bathing or food in the last two days?
Is it a little or much worse when you're sweating or super muggy. Or sick sweats making it worse, or alcohol sweats?
* Just like the monks and their fasting and sleep depravity meditations that they use to open the door ways to become enlightened,  these methods of sleep deprivation and stimulation can cause Morgellons to occur.
*  It's not a discussion of your being crazy and drugs are just making you think it. It's very real and these methods can speed it up or open it further for your experience and reality and in truth ours as well.
* Just because it cannot be seen does not mean it does not exist.  Felt, mathematically equated or scientifically understood also... does not mean it does not exist. 

Have you noticed these black flecks to resemble 'flea dirt' if so does your pets have fleas? It can help reduce the symptoms to reality check these things as well as eradicate any possible forms of irritant that would progress the Morgellons and your pet would love not to have fleas ðŸ¤ª

Is your health declining quickly? Or off and on?
Have you had your ears checked for being overly waxy lately?
Do your finger tips ""feel"" farther away from objects? Such as hair, electronics that are on, metal, especially magnets? 
Do the black flecks respond to you as you reach towards them as if they are magnetic? Do they change color once placed on a surface and no longer in contact with your physically body? Do they seem to jump off you or on you?

I know that this sounds insane.  I have been trapped with Morgellons since I was 17. I'm 37 now. I have had a multitude of symptoms that have scared parts of my skin and have numbed my right hand, turned my skin several different tones of white and native American tan in splotches like Michael Jackson.  I have had my vision blurred from these spider webs. 
Even right now my left nostril has been being filled with these ""webs"" that are invisible and turn to vapor when I pull them off.  

I am clean and sober. I have a mental diagnosis that came before the drugs and (Actual ADHD and Adult ADHD,  they have given me antidepressants/antipsychotics and benzodiazepines for stress and anxiety and anger and pain. 
I have been told yes its in my head, and yes there is something going on. 
I had isolated Shingles when I was 20. Yes the old persons virus of chicken pox.....
I am a healthy person. Yet I have unexplained painful symptoms and my condition has no patterns or symptoms when I go to specific places.  I eat well, sleep well, and am currently not on meds because of the negative effects that they will bestow upon me when I am older. My Morgellons is under control currently.  Except now the crawling on my tongue and temples.  

##You May Skip this As it is conspiracy theory according ""them' my experience and beliefs after that I will discuss my methods of having a higher quality of life with Morgellons##

**The fact is, yes the meds help...... but they don't cure anything or even reduce their risk and symptoms.  They make you unaware of your affliction.  
The facts this is man made and the truth that in the 1600's was the the first real case, by Sir Charles something, (I will look it up and edit) in an Asian provenance I believe, which he was later hung for zealotry.  And he was was an ordained person in the area. The fact that that 68% of people who are afflicted are from the US. The fact that the conspiracy theorists are starting to be proven mostly accurate is that the internet has no way of being completely ignored by users who are capable of doing real research on it, makes the processes of ""big brother watching"" more invasive; proving that they are engaging and engineering some sort of parasitic species of synthetic organisms bound to bioluminescent marine species and invi species of parasites are being planted in food and medicine and distributing them to the masses. **

## HOW I DEAL WITH MORGELLONS##

I use Selsun Blue. It literally serves the purposes for more than dandruff.  It can burn on spots and it is a b(*)h around the eyes. And it is an expensive remedy. I buy a bottle every two weeks and during super bad flares once a week. I sometimes go without for a month and apply when remembered.  But that's in the summer and I am a sun lover and the sun will help as well. Not too much though and depends on area, lots of pollution more apt for the emissions to absorb into your baking skin.
I use magnets, regular bathing,  cleaned up facial hair.  Clean house and bedding washed weekly or bi weekly. Meditation (prayer also) and anxiety coping mechanisms.  Regular exercise and outside activities, including camping. The itching from Morgellons and the itching from plants and insects can be very similar but bugs in the forest can be very helpful in building your body to stand the invisible and remain calm around both the physical and the transparent (not overreacting will save your mind)
So run down list::

Selsun Blue; thick layer so it is opacity is just blue thinned over skin tone. Leave on for 5-10 min ( turn water off and rub in the solution keeping it on the most affected areas being very careful around private parts and mouth and eyes. 
At first Every shower for a month.  Then taper down to when needed but scheduled once a week in between. Space the scheduled out to 2 weeks then eventually monthly,  using if needed between. 

Magnets; small and strong, round and smooth; ace bandage or brace, or any ways of keeping the magnetic field to the tips of your fingers or toes to the biggest joint system stemming to the shoulder blades between your spin and plate mid back,( where you should feel a great amount of pulling and stress)

Never leave a magnet around your face as it will attract the morgellons upward and make it worse,  everything from the crown down should stop around your center and be a slow sweeping slowly down and a quick and further away from skin up stroke to help improve blood flow to help flush Morgellons down and out.

Blood has iron it will respond to your magnetic field you produce as a living being, the magnetic resonance you are having with the fields your creating with the magnets and the Morgellons 

Exercise; I walk 15miles on average a day. Arm curls and push ups. All for blood flow and mental prosperity.  Morgellons has a hard time affecting one space when your blood flow is good and your pathways are healthier because Morgellons starts in the blood and seeps up into the Derm while it's being formed during its 45 day renewal process and becomes part of you...... creepy I know.
 Again I will post links for my findings. Hopefully I still have them in my notes app. It's been a month)
But basically these synthe black flecks could be resembling flea dirt because that's what your neurons in your very powerful brain is telling you that's what they are and because its part of your DNA pattern and its responding to your electrical nerves it forms that way and appears on your skin .....
So keeping the blood flow going, keeping those lungs pumping will push the Morgellons out as usual material does through urine, breathing, sweating and mucus. Excersis is the beast you need. 

Keeping it simple; when speaking of it, make it less mystical and strange and so over powering that it makes you sound mad.
For example I use these kinds of statements
""Oh yea I have a skin condition that causes me to expel common and foreign toxins from the body in weird ways, it drives me nuts cause it can be super uncomfortable for me. But from what I understand from some doctors it's not contagious because everyone's got it, mine just goes nuts sometimes.""  Or ""yea I have a skin condition"".  ""Its not a contagious thing"". If they seem worried about that part anyways. 
Or
""I had an itch"".  then use mental discipline to excuse yourself to the bathroom then go wash your face or scratch like a loon in the stall. Or both. 

Lotions make it WORSE!!!!!!!!

If you need immediate relief like an anti itch cream

Baking soda, no whitening needed,  toothpaste, a big tube, cheap is fine, put a layer of it, yes even on your face, if your home at least on the itching area and an inch radius around the affected area. Apply generously and every once in a while wet your fingers and gently message the toothpaste back with moisture.
 The abrasive texture of the toothpaste will feel amazing as you gently ""scratch"" the itch with your smooth pads of your fingers, and not digging your nails in will help reduce painful scratches and rashes from tearing up your skin. Wash it off after a few hours.

Rubbing alcohol.  Its vaporous in nature and pulls out Morgellons but dries out skin.

That is all I can think of right now. I will get back on in a little while for the resources.  Thanks for reading. There may be information that's off until the edit."

My affliction got worse. Eventually I was over ran with it and started getting fibers. Ive seen it on others so its real. I prayed the first time it went away. The second time I became stuck with it. 
Now I use magnets and it works. prayers are ongoing. works too

Had a friend clone my IP create a reddit account, post something  cryptic to see if there was something going on in my area. Couldn't shake it until i got that message. Not more than five min later, the account was banned from all activity for ever!  Calling it a spammer. It was no spam. It could have been seen as nonsense, but it was a legit question. 
They talk to me. Saying nasty things then turn their heads last min to make it seem that i am having thought projections into my head. My girlfriend tries, she can not anymore. She has been part of it for awhile. But, she has honestly fallen in love with me as well, for real though. She. Despises me for it. Yet she cannot hate more or less because she is only doing this because they have used the daughter as leverage, so, she obeys. 
My entire family has ousted me, ""let me go"" to rumors and debts to pay, in trouble with the law. That sort of thing. It was the healthy choice. So, successful sister has no contact or her growing business suffers, both reputation wise and financially. Very conservative mother who used extreme male shaming and sin shaming to raise me is at a loss and needed to sell the house, my stuff is the last to go. I get it out of the attic and then she moves, to where?? Idk? And she has not contacted me since.
I am a superb father and excelling teacher and wisdom/critical thinker impartar. I have no contact with my daughters, my son, visitation supervised...... i have never hurt those children. 
Here is the script more or less from EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO HAS KNOWN ME OR CURRENTLY IDENTIFIED AS SOMEONE WHO KNEW/KNOWS ME>>> 
oh man that sounds awful, does it really get that bad for you. That sounds exhausting. Get on your meds, go to the hospitable.<<<<<< 

They tried the state mental facility scare during my jail time. Got picked up years and years ago for self medicating. 
My other sister is a survivor. Amazed my dad didn't die sooner. When one of her last texts came through it said > i don't even know who you are anymore..> fought a little more then done, no contact. Around the same 2 weeks coworker pulls me aside, ^^^ heard from self medicating pusher his SO says i forces myself, violating my extremely important belief system of ""consensual everything"" which i practice daily, in everything, even myself, for rewarding myself with icecream for not talking about this delusion more than five times in a day for two days. My record is 10 hours. Because i am not totally delusional. People are really following me. 
Made a suicide attempt real, couldn't help it. I was done being a yo yo and being hurt emotionally and broken up with then told I'm not. I  didn't want to be committed and i had the craziest experience with two very well done plants. They now have my blood from a job that fell for planted drugs, the bandages from a good deep cut were in this garbage the drugs were in. My spit, from two alcoholic beverages consumed that they had offered. I am fairly certain they saw i had taken full inventory of the entire place what i touches and why. Plus he went to bed amd she came onto me and i said no. So she claims i touched her after. There is nothing in the scene that can show that. I got away, all they need it sperm, couldn't give it to my girl, she claimed she's preggers and the clinic will swan before the abortion. And we always got in the biggest fights for two days where she says if i don't please her soon she will leave.... pressure sucks. 
Bluetooth pen for camera stops working around people i need to snap shot with hands free use of camera function and voice suddenly fails= control over phone.
Statements to adhere to delusions. My delusions are usually supernatural. My girlfriend, the only one not trying to commit me, says its demons its the only thing that makes sense since it is the entire metro area. But, my delusions are never actually sanity questioning for me.
Let me say this with this. I seriously questioned my sanity with this one
 While the other ones i was throughly convinced that i was in whatever supernatural thing is happening. Then there is this. Everyone in my direct location look at me like some kind of monster. Suddenly in my extremely poor building, everyone has money, everyone knows and a43 saying evil nasty things. If a cop rolls by, IF they are seen, then they are there to kill me, no other ways about it.
My third suicide attempt is the one i OD on it as much as i can put in the body before fully passing out. The cop stopped me, my girl is wailing in the back round, day before she was venomous and saying i should off myself. So, its convenient for this to be the thing that happens. I get on the strapping stretcher. Its cool but suddenly dispatch comes on wondering where everyone is. They all started laughing. The ambulance driver has markings that remind me of my girls love for us and mine for her, i say something, she jams the hand needle thing so hard and terribly i feel it in my elbow. 
She is calloused, like my girlfriend. By the time i am in the safety room i notice needle marks on my man parts including the sac, between my thumb and finger. Odd i thought. They have me pee in a cup, no patient #'s. They never collect it. They bring in a guy, he.claims to be the mental guy, he says I'm dealing with depression and i should be fine. Oh in the safety room i still had a belt and shoelaces on......
I get in the lobby, only wearing jeans one soc, both shoes and a tank top
 Got my wallet and phone. Messages from my girlfriend saying she will miss me and the best parts of her life are in those moments. I realize this now. I am being played by the world, oh well i still love her. I will turn her to good.
We make up again. I promise not to threaten death, she promises her breakable promises. We move on.
Things are the same with every single person around me. Same blasted sirens, same void of certain elements. The same dirty stories but different on public transit. This all is crazy. So, now i act as if it is a game. So i dance for the repeat cars or the convenient market cell phone video recording sessions..its is a comedy.

Evolution also supports inbreeding as the foundations of genetic mutation and individualism. The mutations could not have occured within a species able to survive as exact replicas, which would have occured within the beginning stages of a-sexual reproduction, no mutation would have occured as the organism would be exact. Us being unique is a result of deformities that cycle through exact genetic combining. Which is where all the old national leaders were like pharaoh, were inbred to remain pure, their deformities the same (clubbed feet) but because we evolved male female the asexual organism died off to support its offsprings survival.
We are technically inbred through mutations of spawned by asexual organisms that needed to inbred to populate Pangea. Without inbreeding we would have never gained higher functioning brains because that also is a deformation. For survival Â it causes people to be unable to survive due to emotional outbursts, negative eating habits, personality disorders, and random killing for pleasure. If we did not have these deformities our survival would be guaranteed. 
To establish what I mean. The detriment of tools is excessiveness, evolution is organic and pack, predator, prey minded. Offspring survive on nurturing or alone. The strongest of the particular species will survive through development. We deformed in the early stages and the mutation set us apart from the natural order, creating the most destructive force on Earth. 
We began over populating because of pleasure, we became aware of resources and began dilapidation of Earth's planetary balance, we gained control of animals needed in the food chain. It is now to the point where we have destroyed our habitat we have not survived or thrived we destroy.
Cross race (specie) is how to correct the imbalance by retrigging genetic mapping to restore survivability, so genetic disorders can be eradicated. We were not supposed to win physically as the strongest species. We literally used a flaw in our mutation to gain the upper hand and begin destroying everything. We are literally evolution's biggest flaw. 
Intelligence and pleasure is harnessed by both humans and dolphin, they survive due to communication and staying in certain numbered groups. We are killing them.
The theory of evolution pushed as truth will state what i say, however will glorify ourselves. Because we are too blind and hopeful which leads to current evolution progress
The next step is taking away the higher functioning brains (autism, retardation, etc) and remap the code again, causing the species to drastically reduce the population seeing that in most circumstances that they would be unable to grow food. Hunt, or find potential mates to conserve the traits needed to survive, thus inbreeding would occur 
Or
Have faith that Gods adam and eve were very base and were living through His creations evolution period and when they ate of the tree it sparked everything said above still on pangea, and inbreeding then added the higher functioning brain with animalistic inferior instincts and it kept going and then the flood happened and the Fertile Â Crescent was full of human based genetic species, it caused the earth's crust to break open and the atmosphere to change, creating a less harsh one outside the crescent, (theory: ice age) and now we have the traits of noah and his sons and the animales that God called for the survival of this new shaped land, (and an entire populated pangea under the fertile crescent; oil middle east) 
I do not believe you can disprove God because He is literally THE energy. we have theories on what this means I Began realizing you can't throw science away since it is truly just fraction of His power that we barely understand, i mean He created it. Â Like, He said ""Lets there be light."" and matter exploded into the void creating an eternity of space that He is not bound to. Big bang, something out of nothing, created from a dimensional being outside our understanding. 
This theory supports facts on both sides, yet both unseen, science is discovered never created, cause it is God's. 
Evolution and God in theory could be true, both requires a grear amount of faith
All of evolution is theory, so is God, aliens, and other ideas. And if you have not researched, doing due diligence then call another person stupid for their understanding, you are a fool."

Our relationships are suffering from people who cannot love with sacrifice in mind.  They build up this process of thinking that they are more important than others until they introduce themselves into another person and they still live with their separate lives.  Then we coin off those bonds as codependency and minimize our partners needs. If an issue arises from the separation of the two people who want one way over the other, they say screw it and just walk away.  They were not capable of doing anything but what served oneself. 
You can only correct and grow from discipline and education of the growth.  But,  we prefer to be afraid of being completely vulnerable while in relationships,  which is why they don't work. We get tainted with your selfish walls and coin it off as well,  calling them boundaries.  If you are not in a relationship, you can't create healthy boundaries as you utterly believe that you know them well enough by your standards you have chosen alone,  once you've been in the relationship, you learn how you truly feel about the boundaries and how much you feel about their boundaries. Again,  if you don't sacrifice,  if you don't need them,  if you are better off alone,  then you are the product of this society and its unfortunate behavior and selfish actions brought on by this idea that you have to be perfect/prepared to be in a relationship.

Parenting,eohmhqg,t1_eogc7xj,1558585628.0,"So, I'm fuzzy on the process of projecting.  I didn't realize how uncomfortable with my statement was.  If you're looking to invalidate my life and my positive results with my child due to my impatient attitude towards parents detrimental attempt at normalizing their children.  It's an important step forward from shaming and fear. If your reaction is a anger flares and your kid will accept that they don't get it and they may never get it,  and if they don't ever get it the parent will be angry and yelling and telling them they have to get it.  It will ruin them. This is common and it's wrong.

I know it's not that easy for parents to see their children as untypical.  I am not typical as well as a parent who has a untypical child. He is also known to their parameters to be ""unsuccessful"" so I taught some of his lessons and he learned from my perspective and it seems that he has to solve problems in a different manner.  They don't like it, they mark him down because they don't know how he can do it without having been indoctrinated.

I don't see any of my kids because the moms don't want me to leave my mental illness with my kids in some way. Shocking, I know! If she does not want me to see them she just won't. I have no choice in it. If I were to go through court I wouldn't lose. There is no reason to keep them from me.  But, I can't afford it,  I'm sure she would probably indoctrinate the kids who don't have a chance to be honest and good people.

If it hurts you say something,  if she says she doesn't care or have to stop, then you have no choice,  you have no control. It's a girl who has social injustice security, you have nothing and no one on your side.  She can play with your heart and shit in your pillows,  then she will take her justification to make sure you understand that she has always been in control over the relationship.  If you say anything about it,  she wins,  cause you are a controlling asshole who doesn't respect women.  If her mad your abusive,  you can't do anything about her.  Just let her go through her irrational behavior and manipulations and then when she starts talking about her feelings of the abandonment issues that you are displaying,  let her walk away with her or anything you are, will be used against you and she will find a way to utterly fuck up your life in devastating ways.

AskAChristian,eo94f7m,t3_bqzed7,1558381940.0,"You are allowed to ask anything about anything.  Never let someone say otherwise.  The fact that its speculation about how old it is it isn't necessarily a matter of truth. It doesn't matter in the grand scheme of life and Salvation.  That is truly the only topic that is the most important. The curious must question.  It is perfectly valid and good. But it doesn't mean that if we disagree on the age of the contents of space then God isn't real and creation a farce. The idea is not a matter of being right about something only God knows for fact. We can ask Him when we get there. If it is even important to us in the eternal life. 
I have been kicking around theories about it for years. I have come to the conclusion that we don't know how long, but we believe moses and such. If the timeline is wrong does it matter? What if God made it and they are incorrect about how long Adam and Eve lived pre-sin and it was billions of years.  So what.  Are we going backwards in time to make a point. It didn't matter how long because before sin they were eternal.. . The entire universe is going to be destroyed and rebuilt,  so non of this should develop a resentment or an argument or anything else that it has.  So. If the question of it still burns in you then research all the stories of it, all the theories of it. Then discern through the Spirit which is the one.  If you find yourself being able to be given the answer and its true to what God has given you. Then why not accept it and make sure in the end. I didn't get anything from my prayer, I had been given something else,  the understanding that it causes descent and the world is trying to find out the ""truth"" to just disprove God. I doubt that I can make them see how futile that is. Time is irrelevant to a being not bound by it."
