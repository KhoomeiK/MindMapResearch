What defines the right response to an instigation? The reason why I ask is a gay couple making out can be seen as instigating to a person against homosexuality. The desecration of a holy book can be seen as instigation to a devout follower.

People can be assholes trying to push buttons, but physical responses should be a last resort imo. What's your take on this?"
PublicFreakout,fqzdwi6,t1_fqzbt1m,1589765325.0,"So? A racist won't change their mind cause I suddenly started beating them, nor does it justify me hitting them cause they said something hateful to me.

As long as someone isn't physically threatening/assaulting me, they can say whatever they heck they want to me. I could care less and I live a pretty decent life.

My point was that just because someone says something offensive, assaulting them isnt the right response (especially if she's a 80+ year old wheelchair bound person, she's clearly a dumbass, treat her as such). If you want to go back and say shit to them, go right ahead, but don't go assaulting people cause they say something that offends you.

The way you break it down is so basic yet powerful! And you're right! My gut reaction to such subreddits was always that off, meh, I know better, these guys are weird, too extreme etc. But the more I thought about it, it is slowly starting to dawn on me.

As /u/Snowboard18 suggested, I've started reading the sidebar with a much more open and receptive mindset. My gut reacts in a very closed off manner to certain things, but I am keeping your analogy in mind and that is helping me internalize things better.

""The idea here is that if you bombard your brain with the same message or pattern, it will take it and accept it as a more constant truth.""

This here is key! I asked a different question surrounding being unable to defend myself physically or feel scared enough to freeze and a person basically said I need to drill things in my head so that if a situation arises my *gut* reaction becomes different and I don't freeze.

I've been in sales for the better part of the last 2 decades so talking to strangers comes to effortlessly to me that others are just in awe at how I can do it. I need to implement the same process in other areas so that they become second nature.

So I am focusing on the physical and subconscious part of my personality. Things wont change over night, but I am in it for life!

Like imagine a gun being pointed right at your face, and then imagine the wimpiest of guys reaction, that is how I react to someone physically confronting me.

So you're absolutely right, that is the true test and one of my biggest paint points I am actively trying to resolve. Instead of avoiding any such altercation by pussyfooting my way in life, I want to be able to deal with it head on!

I've started reading a book called No More Mr Nice guy and it described me pretty well. I also plan on enrolling in a few self defense classes (once this Covid thing dies down) so I can get used to that situation so my mind can overcome it's innate inability to deal with it as well."
seduction,fn9mazx,t1_fn9jb18,1586778254.0,"Yep, I signed up for a few classes but can't go anymore due to covid 19 lock down in place. I wanted to do what I could mentally before jumping back in. Heck, I'm willing to pay extra for a few one on one classes with someone that can push me around and teach me how to snap out of such a situation so I can train my mind not to freeze in such moments. Was thinking of joining a Krav Maga class since self defense is their primary focus. 

For me it's honestly not about winning, it's just not freezing. I am a relatively a fit guy and I'm sure I can beat a good percentage of guys up IF I learn to overcome this. I just need to overcome this hurdle because it's having a pretty negative impact on me psychologically."

I don't like the genetic material my dad gave me, so my child would be a disappointment in general. 

I don't have the patience or money to have a kid without worrying about it. 

The world has enough kids and i dont want to add to that."
seduction,fn7ta0r,t1_fn7i1u7,1586727187.0,"Oh yea, just went back and read your original comment! Thanks man! I spent a good deal of last night reading it and honestly felt like the book was explaining so many aspects of me that it might have had me in mind.

Will continue reading it this week, but if any other book comes to mind that falls in the same line of thinking, do let me know.

Really appreciate it :)"

seduction,fn7dcvl,t1_fn4g8f8,1586718105.0,"Women are the least of my concerns. It's being a strong individual man that others don't fuck with is what my primary concern is. 

That is the purpose I want to pursue."
seduction,fn7d6ht,t1_fn46wfn,1586718006.0,"These are some deep questions, took me a while to think about these.

Honestly I think it is genetic. My father isn't exactly a strong role model and a pussy if I'm being completely honest. I've seen a lot of parallels in my personality and his when it comes to confrontation. 

I've seen him completely shut down physically. Recent example was someone broke into my house and started beating me (long story I'd rather not get into) and it was my mother and sister that stepped in while he just stood by. 

The one big differentiating factor b/w us is though I am aware, while it doesn't bother him which has it's own weird sort of advantage. But I wont allow myself to be that way and that brings with it, its own misery and opportunity for growth."
seduction,fn7bpuh,t1_fn41o2q,1586717181.0,"Oh I know. I have very little male friends since most guys I've known feel highly insecure around me cause their girl friends take a liking to me.

But I need to find better men to hang around with. That much I've realized."
seduction,fn7bl5f,t1_fn44w4a,1586717107.0,"Someone recommended No More Mr Nice guy and holy crap is that me! Just the first 15 pages in, but damn! Really helping me understand my own issues.

Also the talk is really good, half way in. He talks a lot about the kind of attitude to have in life, but doesn't really give specific ways on achieving it. But it is a good start."

seduction,fn7bbrh,t1_fn46pzu,1586716960.0,"I am working with a coach on these things, but it is a struggle wont lie. Thus asking around to see if something clicks from someone else.

And I did join a muay thai class, but Covid 19 has kinda put a dampener on things. I wanted to focus on the mental side of things while in isolation, thus reading up. Someone recommended No More Mr Nice guy and holy crap is that me! Just the first 15 pages in, but damn! Really helping me understand my own issues."
getdisciplined,fn7agns,t1_fn1dtit,1586716468.0,"That helps! And you're right, I think I've been forcing myself to just look at my issues from a singular perspective. I am going to approach my issues from a different perspective and see how that works.

Thanks!"
getdisciplined,fn7abpx,t1_fn10f0p,1586716392.0,"I think the enormity of the task I want to accomplish just made me zone out and not do the work required. Instead I found myself doing a lot of avoidance behaviors to not feel the ""suck"".

I had a long talk with myself last night and identified things I need to let go off, no matter how much comfort they gave me.

Should be a tough week, but I'll come out better as a result, I know that much."
getdisciplined,fn7a58t,t1_fn0yms0,1586716289.0,"Hey,

Thank you for your response. I think the pointers you gave are excellent, especially the 3rd one. I used to project future me as an exercise, but never really talked to myself looking back. That really helps in creating a much more grounded perspective on things.

Thank you!"
