I’m sorry you’re having a hard time right now :( when I was at my worst and felt like I was completely out of control was when I got on medication. There is no cure all drug for BPD but there are some medications that CAN help with the shitty symptoms. I used to get really mad and snap about the smallest of things that now I find much easier to deal with. I was significantly more depressed. It’s not all gone, but life does feel more tolerable now. And looking back on my journal from those days is tough to read. I was struggling so much and it’s even hard to relate or even remember writing most of it. I want to say it does get better, I hope you can find some sort of treatment that can help with this. Even if it’s just some meditation, not medication lol"

I have BPD and the breakups I have been through were all incredibly tough to deal with, but having a friend there does help to not feel so alone. It’s truly important to not lean on any unhealthy coping mechanisms in that state of vulnerability.
