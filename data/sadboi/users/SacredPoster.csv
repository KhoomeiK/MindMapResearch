CODWarzone,fqfn2h3,t1_fpravzi,1589327880.0,"actually, yes you are.. part of the fun of a BR is watching yourself get better and improve. The fact that SBMM for a BR is even in conversation baffles me. it seems to me that the warzone fan base has become so disconnected as to how a BR should actually be.  Lobbies should be completely random. What makes a BR fun is achieving mastery.  i don‚Äôt care about how a noob feels or plays. why lie to people about their actual skill level?"
