Maybe you can begin by taking care of yourself, by getting the nutrition your brain needs to feel happy. L-tryptophan, vitamine D, HDL cholesterol... Take some cod liver oil too! You can do it! Destroy the old you and build a new!

Stay alive buddy, what you see in other people is only your own mental picture! You have seen happy people, those were images in your own mind. You can be like that picture if you heal your brain. Falling in love helps, it releases oxytocin, but perhaps safe that for the moment you feel better. Hey, your brain needs you to feed it! I am proud of you!

There may be many reasons you are not reaching out to people: not being good enough, not being fun enough, not being empathetic enough... So many reasons! I suggest you find out what part you dislike about yourself. Try having compassion for that 'challenge'. Allow yourself to have those troubling beliefs. 

The moment you stop fighting yourself, you start to heal. Your ego can take an insult, so just allow your negative beliefs. 

It's your soul (or your awareness) where you want to find inner peace. You are way more than your thoughts. So, if you let your thoughts be, it's easier to connect to your soul.
