AskWomen,fgw1qny,t3_f0lrtk,1581155701.0,"Emotional abuse can be so insidious. The abusers can slowly put intrusive thoughts in your head that makes you question even little decisions you make in your life. “Did I buy the right lightbulbs?” “Will they be mad I bought jeans?”  Then they DO make you feel about those choices and you start losing confidence in everything. 

The only things that helped me were therapy, cutting off the toxic relationship, and giving myself small goals that I knew I could accomplish. Those small accomplishments gave me the confidence to move on. 

It’s a process to get out of that mindset but it is WORTH it."
