For example, I have friends who can stay up as late as they want and sleep in as late as they want (when there's no school obviously). I can usually stay up as late as I want, but when there's no school my parents make me get up at 8 am every single morning. It definitely sucks sometimes, but at the same time I get so much more out of my days than my friends, I'm less caffeine addicted than my friends, and it's a lot easier for me to wake up and be productive when I need to. 

Enforcing the rules is definitely a slippery slope, because it's super harmful when parents are too controlling, but it's also harmful when parents are too lax."

* Male penguins propose to female penguins with pretty stones. If they are rejected, they are shunned by all of the females for a few days, after which they try again. When penguins become mates, they truly feel love (or some semblance of love) for each other.
* Certain species or birds have been shown to give names to their chicks. Social species of birds will also learn the names of the birds in their gangs.
* Bob Ross received fan letters every day, and when frequent writers lost touch, he would call them every day
* Cows like music. A study was conducted, and dairy cows that listened to music produced 3% more milks than the control group because they were slightly more relaxed. It was noted that they seemed to especially like Bridge Over Troubled Waters by Simon and Garfunkel.
* Mr. Rogers had a fishtank, and whenever he fed the fish on his show, he'd always announce that he was doing so. This is because a blind girl wrote him a letter saying that she knew he had fish, and wanted to make sure that they were fed."

I ended up buying one bag. I got a monthly card, plus the 500 dias that go with it, and the bag was Magic recipe. I'm satisfied.

I think if you really like the hell event, and all of the lucky bag suits, it might me more worth it because you'd end up with like 15 suits. If you can rationalize spending $100 on a mobile game, it is objectively a good value.

That being said, times are really uncertain right now, so be sure that you won't need that money for other things. $100 is a surprisingly large amount of money, and you'll want to be confident in whatever decision you make."

askteenboys,fopjufk,t3_g8rvp1,1587963403.0,"My opinion on r/teenagers has changed a lot. When I first found the sub, I thought it was awesome. I really felt like part of a community, it was great. When I joined also happened to be the time that girls were first getting really annoyed with the ""girls aren't real"" jokes. I actually didn't agree with that, I thought those jokes were pretty funny for a while. Then I started posting more, and anytime people knew I was a girl, I'd get ""girls aren't real"" jokes. They're funny the first time, but it starts to feel like what you have to say doesn't even matter. 

Anytime I'd post a selfie in r/feemagers I'd get a lot of support there, but guys from r/teenagers would see the posts if they looked at my profile, and many would continue on with their lives, a few would start simping, and a couple would start *creeping*. Getting DMs stops being fun once all the messages are just guys who was to play the number game (the picture with the numbered questions that get increasingly sexual) and guys who ""love your confidence and would like to see more pictures of you."" I know this isn't just an r/teenagers thing, but it started happening around the time I started loosing touch with the subreddit.

The final straw for me was the boys vs girls memes. When it was just the locker room I thought it was actually pretty funny. Then it started branching out to things like wearing funny clothing, having goofy phone wallpaper, chaotic sleepovers, peeing in the shower, masturbating, etc. It kept reinforcing the notion that girls were basic and uninteresting. I was an am not offended by such memes. There are girls who were, and I think they were overreacting. That being said, seeing memes constantly pop up on your feed talking about how girls are boring and guys are quirky gets old, and it can really start to make you feel unwelcome. I'm not trying to be the joke police and act like everyone has to be included in everything, because they don't. But in their peak these jokes were everywhere, and they were excessive, and the subreddit stopped being fun. 

I ended up going completely to feemagers. I was super active there, and for a long time I had the top post on the subreddit. It definitely wasn't my best or proudest post, but it made me feel like I had finally found a fun community. But feemagers got bigger. And I saw the same kind of dismissal that girls got on r/teenagers happening to boys on r/feemagers. I'm not surprised. r/teenagers is such a hivemind at this point, I can understand why girls might lump all guys together, even if it isn't fair. That being said, posts on that sub started to be more attention seeking, low effort, and karma whoring. It's starting to look more and more like an effeminate version of r/teenagers. 

At this point I'm not in either sub. I feel like they both breed hidden layers of toxicity, and that they are creating a lot of animosity between the genders. A lot of guys dislike feemagers, and a lot of girls dislike teenagers (sub) for the same reasons. 

Now I just hang in askteenboys/girls and it's all way more chill :)"

I was taking a super advanced class that I was very lucky to get into, and it opened my eyes to all different passions. It's the first year I did Model United Nations. I was finally brave enough to stand up for myself and tell my emotionally abusive father that I was done playing piano and I didn't care if that ""made him sad"". That proved to be a really good decision. I got a cellphone so I wasn't constantly isolated anymore. I got into anime, and made even more friends because of it. I was doing track and field, and I was shitty at it, but it was the first sport where my teammates weren't always mad at me because I was bad. I had an amazing, supportive classroom environment in my geography class, which restored my faith in teachers. I was finally allowed to get therapy, and it really helped me deal with a bunch of the childhood trauma that I carry. I was happy. I remember lying under the table with one of my friends, giggling, and in that moment it was like nothing bad existed. 

That summer, 3 of my close friends moved away, one was one of my best friends. Two of my friends that gave me a lot of my self confidence were a year older, so I was stuck in middle school when they got to go to highschool. My dad decided that therapy was a waste of money and had me stop going. I started self-harming again. A ""friend"" decided to cut me out of his life and bad-mouth me to everyone I held dear. Anyone he could rant to about me, he did. It didn't really damage my reputation, because people knew he was overdramatic, but it destroyed my self-esteem. 8th grade sucked ass. 9th grade was okay, but nothing can beat 7th grade."

It's very off-putting, and it's one of several reasons I'm not very active in r/teenagers or r/feemagers anymore. Then again, it's difficult to keep a conversation going on Reddit anyways. I have way better luck finding friends on the r/teenagers discord server than on the sub itself."

I don't think I believe in any sort of afterlife, but I feel like it hell *were* to be real (I obviously can't prove that it isn't) people who destroy families and people who condemn people for their mental illness instead of supporting them are more likely to end up there than people who are suffering and simply want a way out.

Stay strong, stay safe :)"
