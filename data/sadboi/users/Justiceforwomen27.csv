AmItheAsshole,fk1dwy3,t1_fk10aos,1583777692.0,"‚ÄúSimilarly, compliance with movie ratings is entirely voluntary. Theaters have no legal duties to ensure that children do not watch R rated movies. And, there are no legal consequences to teenagers or their parents, if a child under 17 watches a NC-17 movie. (However, some states may have laws against showing minors obscene materials, and those laws are legally enforceable)

Theater Enforcement

If they want to, theaters can strictly enforce the ratings. Business, generally, have the right to refuse service to anybody as long as the reasons aren't discriminatory. The protected classifications of race, religion, gender, national origin, do not include age.

So, a theater can enforce the ratings by refusing to sell a ticket to an NC-17 movie to a 14-year-old. If theaters do make efforts to not sell tickets to R and NC-17 movie to children, they can also remove children from the theaters for those movies. Chances are the kids did not buy a ticket for that movie, but for a different movie instead.

However, if the theater sold you a ticket to an R-rated movie, even though you're under 17 and not accompanied by an adult, then you have a right to be there. If you are removed, the theater will likely have to refund your ticket.‚Äù

First off, his biting can probably be disciplined out of him. You are the boss! If he tries to bite you, or jump on you, push him away/down and say NO sternly. Or even no bite. He will probably take a little patience and work but huskies are super loyal and wonderful dogs. Another suggestion for  biters is to keep their mouths busy - nylabones & Kong‚Äôs with peanut butter work fantastic. Deer antlers are also great.

If you do decide to keep him you need to have a talk with your parents regarding whose dog the dog really is. Get it in writing and have them and you sign it, give them a copy. I worry when you move out they will want to keep the dog and then you are out all that money. Which IMO it‚Äôs bizarre that they‚Äôve sprung this financial burden on you. If you don‚Äôt want the dog anymore then reach out to as many rescues as you can. I‚Äôd start first with a husky specific rescue as they are usually more responsive and helpful. I‚Äôd even search for regional or national husky rescues that network and have fosters and adopters all over the US. Being a younger dog/puppy will really help his chances at adoption.

I am 5‚Äô8 180 lbs. I‚Äôve always liked bigger guys since I am no waif myself. My husband is very handsome with an amazing personality.

The anxiety has dissipated a lot but he still didn‚Äôt feel motivated to lose weight. 

His weight loss is now the main focus of our sessions. I‚Äôm extremely worried about his health. We are limited in how we travel, where we can sit in restaurants, what rides we can go on when we actually get to a theme park, etc. it‚Äôs also rolled over into our sex life.

It‚Äôs crushing to me that I do everything for us in our relationship to keep us afloat and moving forward but he can‚Äôt do this one thing, which will also tremendously benefit him.

legaladvice,fjdpxrz,t1_fjdoleo,1583256954.0,"I think the first step would be obtaining whatever documents you can from the first go around. You can get these from the courthouse or possibly the attorney your mother used. This should detail the ‚Äúcharges‚Äù and whatever resolution was reached (or if it was dismissed). 

Typically a judge would still rule what they think is legally just - I.e. jail time, a settlement, etc - without a victims input. Victim input can help sway a judge one way or the other. If your mother simply said she didn‚Äôt want him to go to jail then the judge could have taken that into consideration and ordered your father to something else - either a fine, a settlement, community service etc. OR it could‚Äôve been dismissed. If it was dismissed then you have a stronger & potential case. If he was ordered to something, like a fine or service, then he‚Äôs technically been reprimanded for the missed child support. 

Our court systems prevent double jeopardy, so you can‚Äôt keep trying someone for the same thing unless you have new, and usually earth shattering evidence/info. So if he was still obligated to pay support after this judgement was  you could potentially have a new case for all of those years, separate from what he missed before. Step one : obtain the documents - which your mother will have to do. Step two: find a family law attorney. You might be able to find someone who will do a free consultation, which would be your most feasible avenue. 

Also, please explain to your siblings that your mother is not at fault for your father not getting jail time. That really rests on the judge. The only reason your mother would even be partially to blame is if she upended the proceedings and pulled all the charges. Which would‚Äôve prevented the courts and a judge from handing down a judgement."

offmychest,fjdnyvo,t1_fjdmfdi,1583255862.0,"Have a counselor recommend a psychiatrist. You would probably benefit from an anti depressant, especially if talk therapy has not been helpful. You may also need to see a few counselors before you click with one."

Edit: I looked up the statue of limitations in NY on child support and this is what I found:

Under state laws, parents must financially support their child until they reach the ‚Äúage of maturity,‚Äù which is 19 in New Jersey and 21 in New York. Once a child support order has been established in a court of law, or through a written agreement, the non-custodial parent is under legal obligation to pay a certain amount until the child is emancipated. When these payments are missed, this is known as child support arrears or back child support.

In the state of New York, the statute of limitations allows parents to collect unpaid child support for 20 years from the date of default. 


so your mother has 20 years from the VERY FIRST missed payment, however I‚Äôm not sure how that works if your mother has already been in front of a judge. If she still hasn‚Äôt received money since that judgement, and he was supposed to still pay, she could potentially have a new case opened for the few years of missed support."

AmItheAsshole,fjdlugi,t3_fcxg1q,1583255044.0,"NAH. If you choose not to go then tell your best friend that your re-evaluating your life, drinking and friendships. Be very honest with her. Both of you may just be party girls with little reason to change, or one or both of you might have a problem. In which case one or both of you would be an enabler to the other. :/ if you were able to stop for a whole month with relative ease then you may fall more into the party girl category and less into actual addiction category."

I would not be surprised if some of that pay day went to your ex and they just double screwed you. Sounds SUPER shady. Not sure if you need a bankruptcy lawyer, a divorce/family attorney, or a litigation lawyer. I find it hard to believe that they can come back post bankruptcy and say that you still need to pay. And I‚Äôd find it harder to believe that you‚Äôd magically be responsible for your ex‚Äôs half that she can‚Äôt pay? That‚Äôs her personal debt. Also look up statue of limitations on these sorts of things!"

However, I would abstain from sex with her while she is still with her boyfriend. I say this mainly because STDs run rampant on a college campus. For all we know her boyfriend is porking someone else too, who may also be porking someone else, and before you know it everyone has gonorrhea or chlamydia. No Bueno! Personally I‚Äôd temporarily end the friendship/fuckship snd tell her to hit you back up when she‚Äôs single."

offmychest,fj7krlt,t3_fbz8v2,1583092989.0,"Definitely molestation. A similar thing happened to Jessica Simpson. An older female friend assaulted her in bed whenever her family visited the girls family. It turns out the older girl was being molested by an older boy. I wonder if your cousin was being molested or exposed to something else very inappropriate that made her act out that way? You have every right to be upset. However, I would look at it as being less angry at her and feeling more sorry for her :/ and do not feel bad about liking what happened. Children do not know how to appropriately distinguish pleasure from sexual pleasure. If you‚Äôre really struggling with it I highly recommend a talk therapist."

Pre-presidency she was photographed from time to time, usually just at special events. She apparently enjoyed a life that consisted of taking care of her son, her parents, Pilates, spa, and going to mar-a-lago. Now her every move is photographed, entire teams of security everywhere she goes, forced to take on a platform, attends never ending state dinners, summits, panels and travels to countries she doesn‚Äôt care about. We will see her smile again whenever this presidency is over."
