mattcolville,fkdkie9,t1_fkdkc6n,1584082390.0,"So using the term skill check makes me a dumbass? Interesting, and what else do presume to know about me even though we have never met?"
mattcolville,fkdkcx8,t1_fkdk54s,1584082208.0,"I know the terminology and I choose to use the widely accepted term instead. You are like the dumb fuck who insists on using scientific terminology when you could just as easily use laymen's terms. In fact ""laymen's"" is considerably more effective communication because everyone knows what you are talking about."

mattcolville,fkdd940,t1_fkd7tev,1584074853.0,"The assumption that your reason for playing the game is the same as everyone else's is pretty narrow-minded tbh. There are many reasons that people play d&d and as a dm you should know the reasons your players play. Knowing will help you build a game that caters to the group, and overall you will have a much smoother game. Imo at least."
