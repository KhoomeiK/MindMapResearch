BPD,ff7ya03,t1_ex1ifw9,1579661231.0,"I’ve been cutting people like that out of my life, or setting boundaries if they’re my relatives. That helps. It may be lonelier at first (this part is really difficult) but at least you stop having so many people around you who keep taking up the spots but not delivering the support, the disappointments eat away at you. When you do this, you would at least free up those spots and there’s a chance of finding better friends who can actually support you. 

For me, after cutting out around 80% of my “friends” and freeing up that time and space in my mind and heart, I was able to recognize the good friends who have always silently been there for me but I somehow overlooked and took for granted and never really prioritized. I started investing quality time, care into these friendships instead and realized they always return my efforts with more effort and more love. They always made me feel full, and safe to share my vulnerable thoughts, be myself, and that I’m always cared for. My darkest thoughts are embraced. It was a world of difference from the friends I had before. letting go of toxic friends took a huge leap of courage, and the transition was scary and lonely as hell, but being with the right people is so worth it! I was never confused anymore as to why my past friendships were so uneven."

SuicideWatch,ff7q9u5,t1_exvv81x,1579655736.0,"Have you watched “What Dreams May Come”? I think it helped me not exactly to feel better, but to think twice about committing suicide. The movie showed how our soul and mind continue on after death, and so the negative mindset we were stuck in, that led to a suicide, persists after death, thus trapping our soul and mind in a personal eternal hell for those who commit suicide. And not because a god decided to punish those who commit suicide, but because suicide is a condition where your mind is stuck in a negative spiral, which you can’t get rid of even if you kill your body. So suicide doesn’t end the suffering, suicide makes the suffering eternal, and getting our mind and soul to a better place plus building a more genuine support system is the solution."

Intellectually I know to avoid doing this, but trauma patterns are tricky precisely because they tend to happen very subconsciously and training yourself to be able to spot it as it’s happening, which is what I’ve been working on, takes years.

If you suspect you have this, I agree, see a therapist, or if that’s out of the budget, I’ve tried BetterHelp.com and it’s a decent alternative."

ModernLoveTV,f7z20kd,t3_djjmpv,1574104117.0,"This episode made me so sad, and I cried for myself, for others like me, like the main character. It’s so important to have stable caring, loving, supportive constants growing up. Without this, we search our whole lives for mothers, fathers, sisters or brothers in strangers. As a kid my parents were rarely around, they worked late, and the only one who was there for me was my older sister, but even she was taken from me when I was in 3rd grade. She was sent to a boarding school. Thinking back, that’s the exact time I started to become rebellious. 

Watching this episode made me realize I’ve been searching my whole life for big sisters, mothers, and fathers in my colleagues, in my friends. I made certain people in my social circle my mom-figure, made certain colleagues my big sister, a certain CTO my dad. 

They always disappointed me in the end because the chances of finding someone who could really live up to being your unconditionally accepting and loving family member forever is low."
ModernLoveTV,f7ysot4,t3_dln4aj,1574100134.0,"These are stories of real people from the New York Times column, with a few fictional bits added. So yes I believe they’re based on reality. Also, personally, episode 5 (*In the hospital, an interlude of clarity*) reminded me a lot of my boyfriend and myself. So I guess in that sense the stories are very close to the truth too.

My boyfriend and I were colleagues, and long story short, we were very lucky to somehow have gotten naked metaphorically right in the beginning of our relationship. Otherwise I used to be the type of girl who tried to always always act and look “perfect” with men in the past, which is an exhausting and painful way to have nonstop mediocre lukewarm relationships. But not this time.

Because of how vulnerable we got so early on, we knew how to understand, protect, and love each other immediately from the beginning. And because of this, the trust I have for him from the beginning has been on another level, like family. A lot like the moment they had in the hospital bathroom, where they felt like they caught a glimpse of themselves as an old couple. We were like that from the start as well."

My dad refuses to see it. And gets annoyed that I can’t act happy-go-lucky like my sister.

But that’s a good word to use, “ugly”. Maybe I’ll say that to him next time to help him see his own behavior. 

My dad acts so ugly sometimes and for me to even continue the conversation (to have any chance of reconciling my wounds instead of giving up on him again) I must not react at all. Otherwise all hell will break lose. I have to be infinitely patient, infinitely kind, infinitely gentle, and infinitely absorbing of all the ugliness even if it makes me feel like bawling and banging my head against the wall.

relationships,f3n7oap,t3_dh34g6,1570995597.0,"Agree about the grief counseling and possibly couples counseling working out issues with your girlfriend. That’s always helpful. But... I also believe you and think it’s extraordinary that the kid is so much like your brother and was born so close to the time of his death. This type of anecdote is common and being completely serious I believe he could be a reincarnation of the same soul. There’s a school of thought that believes that souls who love each other stick close together throughout lifetimes, they are reborn as special people close to you, be it family members or close friends. In this school of thought, souls also choose their mothers.

It’s not entirely impossible that this soul picked your girlfriend as his mother because he knows you’ll be in her life. 

I think it’s worth trying and seeing if you can work out your issues with her. From what you’ve described, the issues don’t sound irreconcilable. This is the type of ups and downs that many marriages regularly experience and survive through. You said she doesn’t even seem particularly interested in herself, that clearly means she’s going through something. Being completely serious again, maybe individual counseling is needed for her. (Not a great reason to leave someone if I may insert a bit of my personal judgement. You know the Marily Monroe quote, “If you can’t handle me at my worst, you don’t deserve me at my best.”)

Also, I think you should let her know your thoughts about all this, if you haven’t already. Do find a considerate way to communicate this to her where she’ll be comfortable and not react scared or outraged or think you’re insane. After all, you are in an intimate romantic relationship, where communication, trust, and mutual understanding is critical."

relationships,f0ypbea,t1_f0ykv07,1569074752.0,"Well, so I’ve been in his shoes and although I chose not to tell my partner so I wouldn’t hurt him (so just to be clear I do agree it’s unnecessarily hurtful to point out what he perceives to be OP’s flaws like that) I thought those superficial and judgmental things in my mind, and it was more from ignorance of how I was influenced by society’s toxic values and having the wrong friends (whom I’ve gotten rid of since) and not from a plain vicious, evil intention. More people have this problem (toxic societal values, fake friends) than you think.

From my experience, most people do not go around trying to be straight up evil, but rather they lack courage to do the right thing, are ignorant of or clarity on what the right thing is, or just needs assistance. This is the unfortunate struggle of human nature, and yes we can do better but condemning people as evil like you never make regrettable decisions yourself is naive.

Edit: ok well I was only trying to offer the other perspective in this situation. Never do I say I agree with what he did or condone it. But digging into all perspectives usually helps to see the deeper truth. But I guess most of you just want to hate? I don’t get it. The boyfriend has his perspective (however unpopular) but isn’t it worth looking at? I also really doubt he’s been with her for two years just to use and abuse her."
relationships,f0ylvnu,t1_f0xvbi2,1569072982.0,"Same and I agree with everything you’ve said. I also kept my boyfriend of two years from family and friends for too long, but decided to excommunicate those friends because of their toxic values and the fact that I would be worried that I would expose my boyfriend to their unfair judgment if they were to meet. My parents are sort of the same way but less horrendous. The process of loving and accepting everything about my boyfriend has been an incredibly eye-opening shedding of societal toxic values. Now I see his “flaws” as adorable quirks and they make me warm. And I’ll admit I was too concerned with what others think of me, and that I was wrong to see a partner as a reflection of myself instead of an individual who has decided to go through life together with me. 

This whole comment section is filled with people who see OP’s boyfriend as a one-dimensional evil abuser who’s intentionally using her. I think it’s important to realize that kind of “othering” is dangerous, close-minded, and shuts off many possibilities.

relationships,f0ygk7o,t3_d74qw8,1569070026.0,"I am that guy, well not exactly: I am the asshole girlfriend [32/f] in an almost identical situation with a boyfriend [31/m] of two years I haven’t introduced to my parents (or friends except a selected few.)

I know I’m being the worst human but honestly I do love him. How we met: we were coworkers and friends, the whole company knew he had a massive crush on me which I thought was cute. Then when he decided to go on to a different company, I realized I missed him and called him up. We’ve now been together for 2 years and a half, living together for 1 year, I’ve met his entire family and am friends with his brother and his best friends.

A few things I’ve realized from this situation:
1) He does deserve better.
2) I had a group of friends I’ve known for 15+ years that I primarily hung out with whom I never wanted to introduce him to because of the same reasons the OP’s boyfriend stated. Now I see those reasons are not good enough to do what I did. Eventually I saw the problem was them and not him, they’re superficial, pompous, and not real friends to me (if they can’t see beneath the surface and would do/say anything that could hurt someone I love.) I got rid of them all. Although, I haven’t introduced him to my parents, maybe the same problems exist with them too.
3) The attractiveness thing is a real issue. Maybe this alone is grounds for him to leave me, for OP to leave him, I don’t know, I wish it wasn’t because I do adore him and try to show him every day how much he means to me. OP’s boyfriend may have true feelings for her. But I am not sexually attracted to him, I have never told him this because I think hurtful words like this you just can’t take back and it’s not his problem he’s not attractive to ME. The reaction you had after hearing his thoughts about your attractiveness is the catastrophe I try to avoid. So please, OP, know that in terms of attractiveness, the problem lies with him not you. Attractiveness is highly subjective and may have more to do with what you carry with confidence in yourself than physical traits. What I mean is, you may be confident when you talk and that’s sexy but when you’re dressing up you aren’t as confident and that’s not sexy. Maybe the solution is simply to find where your physical confidence lies, maybe you’re an athlete, who don’t always have the most feminine bodies but are sexy because they’re capable, strong, and so healthy. 
4) The process of loving and accepting everything about my boyfriend has been an incredibly eye-opening shedding of societal toxic values.

And I’ll admit I was too concerned with what others think of me, and that I was wrong to see a partner as a reflection of myself instead of an individual who has decided to go through life together with me. 

That’s all I have to say for now. Will add more later if I think of anything.
