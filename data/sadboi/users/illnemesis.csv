I'd find a huge amount of comfort if I was a woman's second sexual partner. I'm always with women who end up explaining they've been with 25+ men, and have stories to tell about threesomes and fucking maddening shit I can't stand.

When you made the point about a woman having two kids by two different men shouldn't have any time to date, that's a valid point.

They keep the kids, get the child support, and come away unscathed while leaving the kids at home and going on Tinder dates.

Not only are they ""dating"", they're having threesomes with strangers. Getting pregnant and aborting the ones in between. I can say this, because I've seen this... Many, many times. With women I've dated; women I've married. *shudders*
