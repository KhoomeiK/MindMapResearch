CPTSD,fqv3lyc,t3_gksxiz,1589669195.0,"The fact you have identified this action/event as a trigger is part of the battle to healing it. Whether you decide to work on it is up to you (you might have bigger problems to deal with), but it’s an opportunity for self development.

My shrink set me the exercise of using social media to learn how to argue - not in a douchebag, nasty way, but like proper debate and being able to voice an opinion or fact without fear. 

As a kid, I was beaten and shunned for complaining, saying no, or daring to talk back. As a result, I developed extreme anxiety about speaking or being perceived to disagree. I could not handle the idea that someone might get upset or angry by something I said, so it was easier to not talk. As a result, I didn’t acquire conflict resolution skills, or any confidence that what I said or thought would be accepted.

So, learning how to interact, argue, and not get upset if others disagreed was an important thing. The safest way was to start anonymously, on the internet, where the value of my words and ideas would be the most prominent, not me as a person. Yes, there are some awful people on the internet, and it can be a cold, nasty place. But at the same time, there are some great, compassionate minds behind usernames, and it is an important tactic to decide who is worth listening to and who isn’t. Plus, if it all went to shit, then delete account and start fresh without any judgement. You can’t do that with family and friends. Also, I found not all trolls are equal. Some are just funny shit-stirrers that can fight back. Those are useful life skills.

Not every downvote or comment is equal. Working out what counts and what doesn’t it part of the puzzle. Also, realising that most downvotes and comments are in response to something you’ve said or posted, not you, is the key. You may find people are reacting to something you’ve said because it doesn’t fit with the common bias of that subreddit or group, or they have a different experience.

If you’re feeling brave, take a look at the comments that got you the most downvotes and see if you can find a pattern. Was it “right words, wrong place”? Was it phrasing, such as seeming rude or disrespectful? Was it something else? This might help you put some much-needed distance between your posts and you as a person.

I sincerely hope this helps.

Or, if he was the kind of person to think the bible was a book of generally wholesome spiritual teachings, intended to help people be “better”, then that again symbolises something different again.

Having someone say “I want to help but don’t know how best to support you”, can be both a bonding experience (because you’re working stuff out together as a team) and comforting because you are hearing and seeing someone admit they don’t have all the answers, but care enough to reach out.

It can be offensive to be told what you should be thinking, feeling, or doing, by someone that doesn’t understand trauma or have experienced what you are going through. Then there’s the painful silence that comes from people not wanting to hear about your challenges or won’t step out their comfort zones to help unless specifically asked in precise detail what you want or need. 

Example: I asked a sibling to help me complete some paperwork, as my condition was at severe level and I had trouble getting into the shower and doing basic stuff, let alone paperwork. She agreed on the condition I email her the forms and wording for every section that she would need to complete, and supply all the supporting docs in PDF. I explained I just wanted someone to come over to my house and help me work out what the questions mean, but even that was too vague for her. I ended up doing it myself as it was clear her “if there’s ever anything I can do to help, just say” was just a polite but insincere “let’s do lunch sometime”.

Even just a “how are you going?” asked with genuine caring and willingness to listen for as long as they need to speak, and without judgement or trying to solve their problems, is important. Nothing is as isolating and invalidating as a supposed friend or support person asking how you are and not interested in the answer - we learn fast not to bother with these kinds of people. If however you are genuinely interested and ready to listen and care about what is said, that’s some of the best kinds of support out there.

ptsd,flmyxg0,t3_fpswc4,1585302546.0,"Fellow C-PTSD person here. 

CPTSD is a different and more complicated beast than regular PTSD, and can take longer and means a different approach is required, as there are for multiple aspects at play, not just a singular trauma.

First up, meds are your friend to help quieten the storm going on in your head, heart, and body. 

Secondly, a good psychologist / therapist is essential. It’s going to take a lot of work delving into stuff that might not even seem like it relates to your trauma that initiated your diagnosis, but believe me, it will make sense later on as all the themes and origins of the causes of your present trauma come together. Hence the “complex” part of C-PTSD. Be prepared to delve into repressed childhood stuff you never really dealt with, but are absolutely impacting on you today.

When I was first diagnosed with CPTSD, I didn’t really understand what that meant, or why my initiating trauma (for diagnosis) wasn’t just plain old PTSD. I mean, everyone has bad stuff happen in their past, right? Everyone has things they went through, but survived and turned out just fine, right? So I thought. Turns out, the survival mechanisms and behaviours I’d developed did work to survive those earlier traumas did work enough to get me through at the time, but they came with hidden scars and burdens. This seems common for CPTSD sufferers. Later in life when something challenging occurs that a person should be able to survive “just fine” (but still trauma enough for anyone to be impacted by it), but old coping mechanisms fail or have become outdated or just make it worse somehow, well, that’s when it turns to shit and welcome to CPTSD town.

There will be a bunch of old, unhelpful negative scripts no doubt running rampant, like “why wasn’t I smart enough, strong enough, whatever whatever to avoid this?” Or maybe it’s guilt, or shame, or supreme unrelenting anxiety, hypervigilance and some really dark, scary thoughts ... not to mention the nightmares and feeling trapped in those feelings. It may seem too dark, too big, too consuming at times to get through, but you will. Meditation, breathing exercises, physical exercise, and lots and lots of therapy will be life changing and enriching. 

Don’t expect a quick recovery or miracle cure. Somethings will help, like CBT therapy, or even EMDR, but might not be right for you. The point is to keep trying, keep fighting, and don’t beat yourself up over bad days or what feels like no progress. Don’t be afraid to grieve, cry, mourn, be outraged and furious, or to be honest with yourself and others. It is all valid and healing.

Above all be compassionate with yourself and be as gentle and nurturing to your own wounded self as you would a cherished, loved one.

Thetruthishere,flmtlvo,t3_fphi80,1585296106.0,"I was 10. It was late summer and my best friend invited me to join her and her family and their friends at a local swimming hole for day-long BBQ and swimming fun. The place was a tidal river with a causeway that was mostly covered by water when the tide was high and became fully exposed when tide was out. 

Adults camped out on the shore with their drinks and snacks, played cards and did general boring adulty things. Kids being kids, we stayed in that water from morning when it was high, until afternoon when it got so low there were just two waist-deep pools either side of that causeway. The water no longer flowed sedately, but rushed through the concrete pipes underneath the causeway so hard it made a sucking noise like what the bathtub drain will do when you empty the tub.

I didn’t notice the snake at first, just that the other kids moved away to further down the stream away from the causeway, and having been exposed to far more dangerous snakes in the past than red-bellied blacks, I knew if I just stayed still, it would cruise on by as it swam on top of the water past us. And it did. But, the 4 year old girl behind me that hadn’t noticed it until then, decided now was the time to get the heck out of there.

Except the force of the water draining under the causeway created so much suction she was swept into the deeper part of the water. By the time I heard and saw her, she was being sucked into the nearer of the two concrete pipes running from one side of the causeway to the other.

I managed to grab her hand and then the other, and plant my feet either side of the concrete pipe to stop us both being pulled in. At first, I was just focused on keeping us from being swept in, and I felt like I was straining against a huge wall of water on my back while staring at what lay at the other end of the pipe: jagged, dirty jumble of rocks, broken glass, and big spikes of exposed reinforced steel rods poking out of the broken concrete. She was screaming and crying, just loud noise and snot and terror. I was shouting and screaming for help, scared I’d not be able to hold on long enough and she’d go first, then me, and we’d be smashed into those steel bars and bits of concrete.

I’d been shouting so long it had turned to sobs, and I managed to twist my head enough to see an adult finally look over, while the kids stood around in white-faced silence. It took me scream-shouting “I can’t hold her anymore” for the adult to pick up their pace from walk to a half-lope.

Then he was just there, scooping the girl up and carrying her away, and I somehow managed to get out of the water myself. I must have sat on the ground for a good hour until my body stopped feeling like numb with pins and needles and could finally get the strength to stand. Nothing was said. None of the adults seemed to show any sign anything remotely unusual had happened, and just kept up with the drinking and laughing and eating snacks. 

I stopped talking for a few weeks after that. No one noticed. I stopped playing with that friend and one day, months later, she came up to me and said her family wanted me to know I was a hero. I couldn’t deal with that, I’d been trying to block out the nightmares of jagged steel rods and water that roared over my shoulders. And worse, the sounds of laughing adults being oblivious and unseeing. Still don’t like concrete much to this day."

AmItheAsshole,fkt7ljm,t3_fkawk1,1584508735.0,"Two thoughts on this situation, both NTA:

1. An employee has the responsibility to manage their medical conditions. 

This means they need to be FIT FOR WORK to perform their duties as described on their job description or agreed duties when employed. This means taking meds or undergoing physio, therapy, or rehabilitation to bring them up to capability to do the job they were employed to do, under the terms agreed to at time of hiring. If they can’t, they need to get a medical certificate for time off work or reduced duties / hours. 

If an employee is genuinely unable to do their duties because of their medical condition, they need to find a job they can do. Sometimes this means job hunting, sometimes talking to the boss to ask if there is something else in the company they are better suited too. An employee can’t just expect pay for showing up

(Before anyone jumps up and down with the “oh but mental illness is different” argument, it is not. I have Generalised Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, Disassociative Anxiety Disorder, Complex PTSD, and Major Depressive Disorder (GAD, SAD, DAD, CPTSD, MDD) and I, like many others with genuine diagnosed conditions, manage my condition so it doesn’t impact on my work performance.)

2. A supervisor has the right (and often legal responsibility) to send a sick employee home if they are too unwell to do their work. 

If the workplace provides sick leave (10 days per year is the norm in Australia), then the employee would go home on sick leave, get a medical certificate from the doctor, and return when the doctor has decided they are FIT FOR WORK again. In those places where no sick leave provision, or the employee is a casual or paid cash in hand, then the sick employee goes home and misses out in pay until they are well enough to work again.

Not sure about elsewhere, but in Australia if you’re sick, have a medical certificate from the doctor but are made to go to work while sick, the employer gets into huge legal strife. 

Something else to consider is that an employer has the right terminate an employment contract on grounds of non-performance, especially if the employee is refusing to carry out duties but has not provided a medical certificate. Laws around this will vary country to country, and by Award and Enterprise Agreement / job contract, but the underlying concept is when you are at work, you are paid to do the job you signed up for, not lie on floors and waste company time shirking duties."
