And I most definitely don‚Äôt feel indifferent to (some) men‚Äôs mistreatment of women and I definitely didn‚Äôt fly off the handle, unlike you. 

I was being sarcastic with my original comment and you decided to take the easy road and assume that I, not ONLY was a man (which is sexist on its own since you‚Äôre assuming anyone who speaks negatively about women is automatically a male), but also hated women, which I do not no matter how much you can try and claim I do. You can criticize women without being a misogynist, Holmes. 

And I really hope you didn‚Äôt just group all men together by saying ‚Äòmen hate women‚Äô because that‚Äôs a vile, toxic mindset to have and I‚Äôm sure you know it. I‚Äôd counter by reminding you that there are PLENTY of women and people who make THEIR hatred of men (*cough, cough*) known through THEIR words and actions and in actions regarding addressing the problem, but I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äòll go back to sticking your fingers in your ears and calling me a salty man if I do so I won‚Äôt bother lmao.
