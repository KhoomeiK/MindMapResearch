panromantic,fr3p0sz,t1_fr3li67,1589862476.0,I feel like there are a ton of us panro aces! I'm not non-binary tho.
asexuality,fqwtoj0,t1_fqwkl64,1589717257.0,"Exactly, especially with questions as frequent as this that is explained extensively in this subreddit and elsewhere in the online ace communities. It's not our job to explain again and again, even if you come with the best intentions. You're awesome for being curious and wanting to learn more, just remember that intentions don't excuse certain behaviours."

bisexual,fqffn67,t3_giaf20,1589324039.0,"There are other words you can use to describe yourself. What I'm hearing is finsexual (sexual attraction to femininity) or polysexual (multiple genders) but a lot of sub identities fall under the bi umbrella so ultimately use whatever is best for you. If you feel like you're accurately described by the label you choose, then go for it."
CESB,fqc6h2t,t3_ghqx48,1589251121.0,"Isn't it great how some courses require proctorio now, which requires you to have a webcam, microphone, stable internet connection, quiet private place to take your exams. This meaning some students need to fork out money for new tech if you haven't already, pay internet bills, have a nice router, and pay rent. All of which is, at best, barely covered by CESB. 

On top of that the conservatives proposed lowering the CESB amount in order to incentivise us to work. Thank god the other political parties disagree."

BPD,foekr89,t1_foei7w5,1587706401.0,Yeah it's never our fault that we're crying or being angry our BPD just makes our reactions more intense. Everyone else's assumptions and actions make us feel the way we feel.
GirlGamers,fodhazg,t3_g6ul2f,1587684686.0,"Ever since I got the drop I've been to anxious to solo queue and after reading posts like this I'm convinced even more not to. I wish there was an option to solo queue for non-toxic, inclusive party members. I wonder what would happen if they made player comfort and safety a priority instead of just throwing everyone together. I can't enjoy the game like this."
BPD,fo9xudq,t1_fo88duj,1587634428.0,was assaulted and someone helped me through it. the first few months were so confusing and i kept wanting to talk to him cuz he understood the first time. his life ended up being too busy and ghosted me. it was so hard i kept trying to message him...so yeah
BPD,fo9xjwb,t1_fo3vv05,1587634164.0,"the power difference is very real. especially when asking for professional help, in my experience ive had ppl not believe I have bpd, think im crazy when they do believe, and think im immature and irrational like everyone fits the textbook definition of bpd."
BPD,fo9xdwv,t1_fo531d8,1587634016.0,I like the thought of being touched but reel at the real touch
BPD,fo9x4to,t1_fo9ftnf,1587633810.0,"ugh my new therapist, wanting to abandon for a while now. also ppl claiming they are really good at deep talks and try to teach you what to do when you have an existential crisis."
ENFP,fo9ww8l,t3_g6ai5k,1587633622.0,omg how tho
GirlGamers,fo26fqv,t3_g55ht7,1587451222.0,"Hi I'm new here too! My first games were mario kart, minecraft and those online minigames like fire boy and water girl. I also play dnd!"
BPD,fo25nx0,t1_fo18veo,1587450512.0,I put up a front too and it is exhausting! ugh I've just been getting involved with online BPD communities and it's made me so happy to see that other ppl get it.
BPD,fo25ikb,t3_g533kd,1587450378.0,YES this is verryyy me. I only unleash my BPD when I'm alone and everyone else thinks I'm okay. Especially when you have to put a face of confidence on like at work or school. My therapist says I act competent but it takes a huge emotional toll on me when I'm alone again. One doctor I visited was not convinced I had BPD and they mislabled me with depression even though I told them that diagnosis did not fit me. My anger outbursts only exist and are only external with a select few people (family). I think how BPD plays out in our lives has a lot to do with how we uniquely experienced our trauma and it can show up different in everyone. I wish my therapists and doctors would believe that I do live with BPD.
VALORANT,fo20jem,t1_fo1w7lj,1587446154.0,Yeah they made her Chinese üòÅ
ENFP,fo1q0s2,t1_fo1m4be,1587438815.0,Yeah it's mixed feelings for me but online school is definitely a negative especially with quarantine. The words on the computer screen have no significance
GirlGamers,fo143xm,t3_g4nbxs,1587425348.0,UGH this is why I haven't played my first game. I just got the beta drop and the thought of solo queuing just gives me anxiety. I cant do it. Even if the people don't end up being that bad the anxiety is still there and the toxicity is internalized. Does anyone else feel this way?
VALORANT,fo1295u,t3_g4uk5b,1587424297.0,This is exactly the reason I couldn't play CS. I just got the drop and I'm nervous to play my first game. I thought Valorant would be a little better and it's disheartening to see that it became toxic within 1 week. I don't have the best game sense because I don't play much comp from being nervous to solo queue. I'm a cis female so you can probably imagine what they say to me. I really want to play but I don't think the community is for me. I wish there was an option to request more inclusive ppl than just having teams be made randomly or something.
VALORANT,fo0zedt,t3_g4x8ar,1587422690.0,omgg looks sooo good. the minute I saw sage I knew I wanted to cosplay her too so bad esp cuz I have long black asian hair.
UBC,fl9k10i,t1_fl98jf8,1584959214.0,You're so not alone. Everything I say is gathered from other people's voices in addition to being a student in this situation. I feel the need to post this on ubc confessions now lol
UBC,fl8767e,t1_fl7elhv,1584917299.0,Every time I look at the clock a bunch of time has passed even though it felt like 15 mins. esp after 12am. anything after midnight feels surreal. my bedtime is at 4 now
UBC,fl86ob7,t3_fn3u8x,1584916999.0,"No one can study. Everyone is stressed about the global pandemic. idk about you guys but being aware of the situation around the world, getting groceries/food, reaching out to ppl, taking care of yourself, is the most important for me and takes a lot of effort. We know nothing about finals and have little emotional and other wellbeing supports from the university, much less learning supports bc UBC seems hell bent on shoving our noses into the books despite wellbeing on a global scale being shit. These are hard decisions to make. Grades are super controversial too. Profs and students are doing all they can but it feels a lot like the entire ubc community is fracturing.   


Does ubc even think about including our voices if the changes they are going to make is affecting us so much? Who is UBC even?  


Thanks for listening to my fragmented rant. UBC needs to stop hiding and reach out, something they've been historically horrible at so idk what to expect lol."
UBC,fgo4orh,t3_ezl8j2,1580959708.0,"Every term feels different to me. Generally, 1st term usually more exciting and innocent, 2nd term more lonely and yeah youre right about the cold."
