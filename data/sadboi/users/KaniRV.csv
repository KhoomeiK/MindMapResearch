Swedes are such sweet people, no racism personally experienced(I am not white), it is a lovely country and that is great! Much love to the Swedes! All that said, I have to agree with you. Never has this been more apparent than during this coronavirus outbreak. Slow to act on it? Check. Procrastination? Check. Being nice and polite? Yes but at a time like this? People ought not be out on the streets, ought not be having fika outside! The PM apologised for causing inconveniences to the lives of people? I am sorry, but it sounded like he was scared of offending his people by forcefully asking them to stay at home.

depression,fke1b9f,t3_fhtx84,1584102454.0,"I both agree and disagree. I am not beautiful/attractive either. And time and time again, I have felt sidelined and ignored in favour of my more attractive friend. People don't even try to be discreet about it. It sucks, I know. I battled with this for a long time and was even heart-broken. But I also realised that not everyone is looking for beauty. It is hard to see, but people will talk to you for you. Think of some childhood friend or someone outside the circle which makes you feel this way and talk to them. Try to talk to new friends, you might be surprised. And slowly, we will start focusing on things that are not appearances. Not everyone is beautiful either. Try to talk to someone about appearances and slowly they might reveal that they too have these insecurities. 
Also, appearances change. I dressed so badly 5 years ago. I researched and spent time on dressing well, it helps a bit. Also, people get old, they lose their beauty. So keep at it. Be good and true like you always have been and time will test your friendships. 
I am sorry if that sounds too preachy. I dont mean it to be. Just that I have been in the exact same place you have been and it has taken a lot of effort and time to see the truth.  I also stopped using the word ugly. It was a conscious choice and I believe it has helped. 
What helps is to focus on other things and people to see that not everything is about beauty. I wish you all the best and hope you will see your own value."

It may be more spicy in some states not so much in others.For ex, in Tamilnadu, the standard breakfast is : idli/dosa with sambar, podi and chutney. Mildly spicy.( it can vary...the chutney can be super spicy)

Lunch:Rice with sambar/some other curry with a  vegetables preparation and yoghurt with rice and then rasam(a watered stew with lots of pepper). Except the rice and yoghurt everything has spice(chillies, chilli powder) Usually goes with pickles, which are spicy.

Dinner: this varies greatly across households, probably the least spicy meal of the day. Anything from yoghurt and rice to dosa or poori or chappati with curry may be had for dinner 

Yes, to sum it up, there's a lot of spice on an every day basis. They may appear mild if you're used to it, but definitely spicy if you're not!"

Introversion is not characterized by the fact that she barges into compartments- I am an introvert but if the situation demands it (in this case helping Neville, for Hermione), I can step up and ask people stuff. Also, I answer all questions I know in a classroom situation- feels like if you know the answer, then this situation authorizes you to speak up(a shy person, as opposed to an introvert, might hesitate to speak, even if they knew answers). An introvert can also have strong opinions and can debate. They prefer quiet, they prefer to have few close friends-fit Hermione to a tee.
This is not to say Hermione is an introvert- I think she is, but she might even be an ambivert. My point is it cannot be stated with absolute conviction that 'these are not the actions of an introvert'. They could be."
