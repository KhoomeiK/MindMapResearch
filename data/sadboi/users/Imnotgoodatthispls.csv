depression,ewv3y06,t1_ewu8xp4,1565798114.0,"I‚Äôm on week 1, I think, of Lexapro and Trazodone and I feel the best I‚Äôve ever felt. I was afraid of taking meds before but it‚Äôs doing the job"
depression,ewv3sfr,t1_ewr4ldt,1565798015.0,I feel you. That‚Äôs rough
depression,ew2fkav,t1_ew1q031,1565045456.0,"It sucks, to say the least..."
depression,ew1iupm,t1_ew0z104,1565024334.0,Np
depression,ew0ymjs,t3_cm4u1m,1565010416.0,"Depression is a mental health issue. Major Depressive Disorder or severe clinical depression is a mental illness/disorder/disease. I know exactly how you feel because I felt that way for years and tried to hide it and keep it to myself. It progressively worsened throughout the years until I had a major episode/breakdown. Do yourself a favor and get help before that happens. Maybe it won‚Äôt, maybe you‚Äôll find something that gives you purpose and peace. But at least talk to a counselor/therapist to talk about what‚Äôs going on."
depression,ew0xucx,t1_ew0xbfj,1565009739.0,Lexapro (escitalopram) is an antidepressant. Trazodone is both sleeping aid and antidepressant. Thank you !
depression,ew0xl0s,t3_cm6z9c,1565009509.0,"A lot of good advice here. I just wanted to add what helped me out in the process. Sometimes it gets overwhelming keeping track of all your feelings, emotions, thoughts, and symptoms so make sure you log it (write it down, bullet points on iPhone notes, whatever works for you) so that you know what‚Äôs going on. You‚Äôre already headed in the right direction asking for advice and posting here. Speak with others about their depression and you‚Äôll quickly realize you‚Äôre not alone and many of the experiences are universal. Research classic symptoms and behavioral traits caused by depression and anxiety, if you find it hard to ‚Äúprove‚Äù to your parents or anyone that you‚Äôre struggling with it. Stand up for yourself, don‚Äôt let others ignorance deter you from knowing what‚Äôs wrong and that there‚Äôs a problem (only you can know). There are steps I took to get the help I needed and tbh, it wasn‚Äôt an easy quick process. Be patient and don‚Äôt give up."
depression,ew0uwsj,t1_ew0pxlv,1565006972.0,"Hey thanks for checking in. It went a lot smoother, quick process with the psychiatrist. He prescribed me Lexapro and trazodone; it‚Äôs only been a couple days but I do feel better/sleeping better. And I was able to write down a lot for my next appointment."
depression,evzxy9c,t1_evztf2z,1564970263.0,"I have ‚Äúgood‚Äù-ish days, where I realize where I‚Äôm at (probably 5 or 6 in total out of the 4 months) but those days can also be filled with waves of pure anger, spite, and resentment or they can be oddly calm and apathetic. I say that to say it doesn‚Äôt end so I learned to write everything down because I will forget (emotions, thoughts, feelings, symptoms, habits). Get evaluated (mine was obviously so bad my father had to call). I saw a regular primary care first, just to see if I wasn‚Äôt actually dying from the personal neglect, but to also get a referral for a psychiatrist -> had to get evaluated first-> then i was scheduled to see him. Take my notes (whether mental if I‚Äôm capable or from iPhone notes) and describe to him everything happening and he prescribed me what I need. I‚Äôve only been on it for a few days (Lexapro and trazodone-for sleep). They scheduled me for a check in in October. From then I‚Äôll see if I need psychotherapy as well. 

TL;DR - Get help... seriously. Medication and therapy (CBT) are your friends."
depression,evzszzd,t3_cm32n2,1564966463.0,"Woah, I legit have the same problem. I‚Äôm currently in the after effects of a major episode (months in bed, lost 30 lbs, no hygiene etc). But the major thing I realized is how paranoid I was as I was spiraling down, even went as far as to block everyone trying to contact me, deleted all social media and group chat apps. I literally felt like everyone was plotting on me, lying to me, and making fun of me behind my back. I even remember telling my dad (resented him for a bit too), that I felt like my friends are condescending towards me and probably only hang out with me out of pity. It‚Äôs wild how distorted and warped my mind was and it‚Äôs even more wild to actually be able to remember it and look back at everything."
euphoria,evzsbyx,t3_cm26ge,1564965949.0,This show is eerily relatable..
depression,evzeh68,t3_clzejo,1564955590.0,"Yeah, I notice I fall deeper into depression immediately after whichever person I‚Äôm hanging out with leaves. I can be cold and distant, but I definitely notice that I get clingy to people I spend a lot of time with and even begin to want to feel special to them (mostly in platonic relationships). I definitely get touched starved. Humans are supposedly social creatures, doesn‚Äôt have to be romantic to want intimate contact and interaction. Even knowing this I‚Äôm still depressed and hate that I get attached."
depression,evvajyu,t1_evuywnm,1564828390.0,Thank you
depression,evu2koy,t1_evsrp0g,1564784087.0,I was surprised to see how many people can relate to this so deeply. I really felt like I was stupid and I‚Äôd try to express that and I‚Äôd just get brushed off.
depression,evsrg0o,t1_evsh6l0,1564754484.0,"That‚Äôs actually really helpful. There‚Äôs so many things over a span of a lifetime and all these layers, it does get overwhelming to try to touch on everything. Thank you"
depression,evsew49,t1_evs1e7f,1564743682.0,Yeah I feel that. I just want to be able to talk but it feels like one of those dreams/nightmares where you suddenly lose your voice no matter how much you try to scream. ( sounds dramatic but it really is frustrating)
depression,evseqpu,t1_evrzuax,1564743505.0,"Never thought of it that way. Could be the fight or flight system, the anxiety is definitely there. Thanks"
depression,evsen8k,t1_evrzqne,1564743387.0,Thanks friend!
depression,evrz6q4,t1_evryqyd,1564723422.0,Sounds like a great therapist. Hopefully my new one will be this helpful.
depression,evrz4s8,t1_evryo28,1564723365.0,It‚Äôs hell to deal with. It ‚Äúmakes‚Äù you suffer in silence in a way
depression,evrz1s4,t1_evruu2l,1564723280.0,Ahhh a day after they happen is a good option. Trying to write while I‚Äôm going through it more than difficult. Thank you
depression,evryyv0,t1_evrte4r,1564723196.0,"Oops my bad, don‚Äôt know where I saw brother. Might have been thinking of my own. Thank you tho and good luck with your sis, I wish the best for her."
depression,evrsgvz,t1_evrrsea,1564717130.0,Lmao that concept is actually the main focus of therapy.
depression,evrs458,t1_evroxde,1564716826.0,"Thank you! Same to you. It is night time, goodnight."
depression,evrs0sb,t1_evrpix3,1564716748.0,"I get where you‚Äôre coming from, I feel like the more articulate you are in explaining yourself, the easier it for people to say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not depressed‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôve got it figured out, jus keep doing __‚Äù. Might be from intimidation or just the fact that they‚Äôre human as well and have their own insecurities. Seems like it takes a process to find the right therapy for all different spectrums. I was turned off from getting help for a couple years until a major breakdown occurred and I had to get outside medical help. I hope you can find the right one that‚Äôll understand your struggles. Maybe mentioning the fact that you over analyze and do a little too much introspection? Idk but I wish the best for you."
depression,evromc3,t1_evrmb1v,1564713949.0,"Yeah man, it‚Äôs tough. Wish we didn‚Äôt have to go through all this but hopefully we‚Äôll get the relief we need"
depression,evrm9rm,t1_evrl6yq,1564712106.0,Thank you
depression,evrm66j,t1_evrl4px,1564712028.0,"This gives me so much hope. Even though I tried to self medicate before, the idea of prescribed meds turns me off because of all the mixed reviews I hear. Thanks"
depression,evrm31a,t1_evrkxzw,1564711959.0,"Yep, the cycles of doubt and guilt start pulling me down further into it."
depression,evrm19b,t1_evrk4ue,1564711922.0,"I feel you, everything in the mind is distorted and warped; anything that was once there in any sense is all gone in an instant.

I know exactly what you‚Äôre going through, but just letting you know that you sound perfectly clear and concise. This is what this twisted disease does to our minds, it wraps everything and makes you believe things that are untrue. Even when we do anything noteworthy it‚Äôs all swept under the rug. This all makes perfect sense to me and you‚Äôre not alone in this. Don‚Äôt apologize, you have every right to vent about your frustrations. I hope both you and I get some type of relief from this by getting help or whatever."
depression,evrli7a,t1_evrlavz,1564711513.0,I feel you. And it hurts even more when they say stuff like that (even though they might mean well)... it just feels like they‚Äôre dismissing your problems.
depression,evrla5u,t1_evrjgsa,1564711342.0,Just a constant vicious cycle. I feel you
depression,evrl93v,t1_evrjbcd,1564711320.0,Same
depression,evrl7w2,t1_evrbvd7,1564711295.0,I felt that... that feeling of everyone thinking you‚Äôre lying or something is rough
depression,evrl46d,t1_evr8upc,1564711217.0,"Ahh I see, thank you I‚Äôd appreciate that"
depression,evrl2ii,t1_evr8rq2,1564711181.0,Smh that‚Äôs rough. I would‚Äôve been so frustrated and even more anxious
depression,evrkylc,t1_evr7f57,1564711098.0,"Thank you, I‚Äôll keep this in mind!"
depression,evrks4x,t1_evr606u,1564710966.0,It‚Äôs good to hear about a therapist that is aware and understands. Thank you. My thoughts are a little more discernible than they were before so I have more hope for my future session
depression,evrkm8x,t1_evr4xm2,1564710843.0,"Lol! I can relate. I had someone tell me to walk to her therapy sessions after telling her about the major depressive episode I was having (being unable to do anything, including eating and basic hygiene). But I‚Äôll get that good ol vitamin D that I‚Äôm missing tho right :D!....... needless to say I wanted to fight her but didn‚Äôt have the energy to do it. It definitely gives me hope to hear you found a good one. I hope so"
depression,evrkc2l,t1_evr4qyk,1564710631.0,"I feel you man, sorry to hear. It‚Äôs like the expectation of doing all that work to get the help makes us believe the one time will alleviate the suffering. But sadly, it doesn‚Äôt work like that"
depression,evrk9dd,t1_evr3wgl,1564710574.0,"I would scrap trying to talk to your mother and go for the help tbh. I had such bad experiences with trying to open up to people ignorant to the disease and I quickly learned that it‚Äôs best to get the help and later when you‚Äôre better, have the talk with loved ones."
depression,evrk4t5,t1_evr0803,1564710479.0,"Yeah I‚Äôm working on doing it more often, especially during the bad times.... easier said than done though. Thank you"
depression,evrk2kt,t1_evqzbk9,1564710432.0,"I didn‚Äôt know psychiatrists do therapy as well? I always thought it psychiatrist for meds only and psychologist/therapist for talk. Thanks for that, I‚Äôll keep that in mind"
depression,evrjxu6,t1_evqz5qo,1564710332.0,Facts! Well said. My mind feels like an abusive partner or something whenever I try to come forward with the truth. Holds me hostage in the abuse.
depression,evrjrbi,t1_evqxoj2,1564710198.0,That‚Äôs good. I need to work on being honest about my experiences... I‚Äôm working on it.
depression,evrjpaw,t1_evquqzz,1564710155.0,"Exactly! Saying I‚Äôm hard on myself is an understatement... and even if I wasn‚Äôt lacking in anything, made accomplishments or progress, it wouldn‚Äôt matter during an episode because I forget anything good about my life."
depression,evrjjfv,t1_evqtsng,1564710034.0,Good luck!
depression,evrjh67,t1_evqtm8x,1564709987.0,Lol it really is man.
depression,evrjfj4,t1_evqtlm3,1564709951.0,"Isn‚Äôt it crazy how we‚Äôre the ones suffering but we try to be so mindful and sympathetic of others feelings. I do that a lot too, just saying things people want to hear... it‚Äôs wild."
depression,evrjakp,t1_evrek26,1564709846.0,"Yeah even when I use to bring notes, it would feel weird talking about it because I didn‚Äôt feel connected to that experience anymore? Idk how to explain it but it‚Äôs weird and I‚Äôd just be confused talking about anything really..."
depression,evrj6co,t1_evrg2pc,1564709759.0,Dang I‚Äôm hearing about wayyyy too many shitty therapists. It sucks that some of them really don‚Äôt seem to care about what they fucking signed up for and studied.
depression,evriumk,t3_ckmvf8,1564709513.0,Same here with culture and parents. That‚Äôs why I had it for so long with no hope and pure confusion. Caribbean/English parents and culture don‚Äôt ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù in mental health issues unless it‚Äôs an extreme and even then there‚Äôs no healthy solution in their minds.
depression,evqummn,t3_ckslk6,1564697593.0,"If they work and prescribed and does more good than bad, it‚Äôs never too much"
depression,evqu94m,t3_ckqonh,1564697443.0,"Functional Depression, is what you‚Äôre describing. Still part of the disease, still a problem..."
depression,evqti3n,t1_evqrfbz,1564697151.0,"Yep, I relate to all this man. And then after all that and being so frustrated I was crying... she started asking irrelevant questions about work, school, dating that made me feel even worse...."
depression,evqt1ub,t1_evqqxeu,1564696964.0,"And that‚Äôs such a dangerous thing to do with someone struggling with any mental illness, who knows what someone is going to do when a professional downplays their struggles . And don‚Äôt bring it up, fuck her lol. Just leave and find someone else but not in that order. She doesn‚Äôt respect you as a patient, she doesn‚Äôt deserve a ‚Äúreason‚Äù . Just tell her you are no longer interested or able to continue the sessions. I don‚Äôt want to make it sound simple but yeah..."
depression,evqrsmi,t3_ckuc0g,1564696471.0,"You are such a good brother and that‚Äôs an understatement. I know this doesn‚Äôt answer your question but I just wanted to let you know that your efforts won‚Äôt go unnoticed by her. I wish I had a supportive brother like this when I was younger. Continue doing what you‚Äôre doing and if she‚Äôs young enough (for you to ball for her) and is willing, get her evaluated to see a psychiatrist and the rest will follow from there. Take her to see a reg primary care physician so they can also do some bloodwork to check that everything else is good and mention the depression to him/her. They‚Äôll give her a referral to a mental health specialist. Hope this helps."
depression,evqqwol,t3_cktt5m,1564696123.0,Currently going through this. Lost about 30lbs in 5 months. And when I do/can eat I suddenly have a wave of exhaustion flush over me. It‚Äôs crazy.

depression,evqpy1v,t1_evqamoo,1564695746.0,That part
depression,evqpvt7,t1_evqawiw,1564695722.0,"That‚Äôs exactly it! The vicious cycle! Or I‚Äôll tell myself I was stupid and overreacting atm and yeah same as you, ‚Äúit won‚Äôt happen again‚Äù smh"
depression,evqpobf,t1_evqcte9,1564695642.0,"Thanks, that helps a lot"
depression,evqpgk7,t1_evqd4g0,1564695559.0,"I hate that. I don‚Äôt see how people trained in this field constantly underestimate what a person is going through.

depression,evqox60,t1_evqgjt5,1564695354.0,Yeah it gets overwhelming
depression,evqomda,t1_evqh2xb,1564695245.0,I can relate. Probably should change the therapists. Doesn‚Äôt seem very helpful.
depression,evqoapj,t1_evqj5y9,1564695125.0,Yep same with me and then I question if I should really be there in the first place... then the next thing you know.. another breakdown. Fun....

depression,evq2jzx,t1_evpzcv0,1564685086.0,"I feel you, I‚Äôm trying to be more self aware of everything but that‚Äôs hard when I‚Äôm spiraling down and everything is distorted. Anxiety plays a big role too, I get extremely paranoid about everything."
depression,evq265d,t1_evpyqhb,1564684865.0,"Same af . & that complaining part is me because I didn‚Äôt want anyone to even have the chance of thinking I was just whining, being over-dramatic, being too emotional, being ungrateful, or just complaining. So it was difficult to open up to anyone."
depression,evq1tx4,t1_evpxfbr,1564684676.0,I feel you. It‚Äôs a rough process finding the right help for sure
depression,evq1q15,t1_evpvr0o,1564684615.0,"Very good advice, and now I see why. Good to hear a mental health professional that knows what they‚Äôre talking about. I can definitely feel for those of us who had trouble at a younger age because I even had trouble distinguishing the feeling of guilt, the maybes and what ifs, I would second guess myself a lot when there were questions I couldn‚Äôt answer or when I was just confused period. Now that I‚Äôm older it‚Äôs easier to stick up for myself and my needs. Thank you for this!"
depression,evq0xif,t1_evpv64g,1564684154.0,Sounds like a good idea to see the psych first. Good luck man
depression,evq0ux7,t1_evpta6o,1564684111.0,"I wish I had that option before, even when I have people willing to help I push everyone away. Definitely do that if you can, she might be able to explain the habits you don‚Äôt even notice and it‚Äôs nice to have that emotional support."
