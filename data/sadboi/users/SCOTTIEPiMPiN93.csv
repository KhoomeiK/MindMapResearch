BreakUps,fi4vefi,t1_fhyvro1,1582149218.0,I’m trying hard to be here. I haven’t given up yet but it’s hard just existing.
BreakUps,fhyj3i1,t1_fh8ea1y,1581976933.0,I’ve tried so much but I just don’t have interest in anything anymore. I’ve been asking for help but don’t have to resources to get it. I know it could be I need to get better for me first off but I’m also doing it for her. One day it’ll get better and maybe me and her can work on it.
BreakUps,fh7hxb5,t1_fggv0cj,1581332722.0,I hope I can get through this. I feel so helpless but not because we broke up. At the same time I know I need her and I fucked it up. I’m trying hard to work on myself and I’m hoping I can get better. I want her back more than anything in the world but I think I fucked it up. I just hope I can’t get back with her because she is literally a piece of me. I haven’t gotten better I’ve gotten worse but I feel like if I had her she could help me get better.
BreakUps,fgfhbcm,t1_fgc19tb,1580738729.0,"I’m not doubting she’s hurting, but she acts like she’s not on social media. I really need to focus on myself but I’ve been so self destructive. I’m hoping if I make myself better I’ll get her back. It’s just so hard right now. Thank you so much for believing in me <3"
BreakUps,fgao8kn,t1_ffjgx44,1580653596.0,I have gotten more depressed since we broke up. I’ve actually been at the lowest. She seems alright like she acts like she is but idk If I believe it. She blocked me I blocked her but I regret leaving her everyday. We basically threw 7 years down the drain but she seems to be okay. It hasn’t gotten easier. I messed up and I regret it.

BreakUps,ezo8k7k,t1_ezev0wu,1568018383.0,"Yeah I’m afraid of her moving on but if it makes her happy that’s all that matters to me. I did this because I wanted her to be happy and I felt like I was bringing her down. Through our 6 years she’s been there for so many traumatic events that’s gone on through my life. She’s seen me super depressed but usually it’s temporary like month on month off depression. This time it’s been since December and got worse. I had no more emotion, didn’t tend to her, never spent time, had sex once every couple months. I felt like I couldn’t give her what she wanted even though she never said so. I lost all my emotions and felt like I couldn’t make her happy if I’m not happy with myself. I broke it off because she deserves so much happiness. She’s the best thing that has happened to me and all I want is for her to be the happiest she can wether it’s with me in the future or without me. She’s said she wanted to be with me forever, but I don’t think it’s fair to bring her down into my depression. I wanted her to get what she deserves. She was willing to be there with me but I didn’t feel like I was getting better at all. It sucks and I hate this whole situation but I feel like she’s better off without me."
BreakUps,ezo7s4w,t1_eze9mk1,1568018001.0,I’m trying to go to therapy. I’m not good at talking because it’s brings all that back up but I need guidance. I don’t wanna go just to get her back. I left her because I didn’t want to bring her down with me. I’m trying to be selfless and she doesn’t understand. Hoping I can get happy and if she’s not moved on try and make her happy again. She claims she wasn’t bothered by it but I just feel as if she didn’t want me to feel worse. So I’m trying to better myself and hopefully I can have her back when I feel good enough.
