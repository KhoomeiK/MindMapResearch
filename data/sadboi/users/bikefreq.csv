Anxiety,fn7pcvs,t1_fn7ky4d,1586724932.0,I haven't tried the two together. Sounds like a great idea!

Anxiety,fn4piq2,t3_fzkvtq,1586646196.0,I only do that under the influence.
Anxiety,fn4gtb3,t1_fn4fnhe,1586641094.0,Thanks buddy. You too. I guess the official term is r/blanketforts
Anxiety,fn4ff27,t3_fzj90j,1586640273.0,"I think that might have been true earlier in this pandemic, BUT doctors have learned quite a bit over time, such as ventilator settings needed to be tweaked specifically for this disease. Furthermore, most doctors are trying to keep patients off ventilators in general, and they are preferring to apply high flow oxygen instead.

All in all, things are getting better, day by day.

Read what Dr Cameron Kyle-Sidell is saying for reference."
Anxiety,fn4cizu,t1_fn4a799,1586638566.0,"It's a tough time for everyone, and there's no shame in feeling the feels. I'm nearly 40. I've cried, panicked, self isolated and been mad with others for not doing things as I would do them. It takes a bigger man to admit his weaknesses and not give a fuck how anyone else feels about them. You do you.

I really like this thread for good news:

DM to come."
CozyPlaces,fn3dikd,t3_fz78al,1586618491.0,Pretty kitty!
Anxiety,fn3bqf6,t3_fz60n3,1586617396.0,"For sure, mine has. I don't typically experience anxiety, and I was pretty good with this coronavirus stuff until everything shut down. I work in an essential industry, my wife is in healthcare and our 4 y/o daughter is still in daycare because we're working. I had a night where I showered just because my wife touched me, and that was after we all showered when we got home.

All I can say is reading about the positives has helped me a lot. I've made a list of experiential treatments and links to scientific studies on trial vaccines. I feel better seeing that things are getting a little better, day by day.

Also, blanket castles never hurt. I'd post a pic of ours if I could figure out how."
Anxiety,fn38t4q,t3_fz62wu,1586615567.0,Anxiety is an asshole. Glad you're on the up and up!
Anxiety,fn2gqgw,t1_fn2gg4w,1586588410.0,You WILL get through this. Try to read/focus on the positives. It helps me. Good luck!
Anxiety,fn2gjaq,t1_fn2equh,1586588209.0,"Seems pretty logical to me. There's a lot to be anxious about right now, and you shouldn't feel silly because you're feeling the anxiety. We all need to be easy on ourselves right now.

One thing that helps me a lot is reading about the new treatments and vaccines that are being tested. Makes me feel like there's some light at the end of the tunnel."
Anxiety,fn2g0n8,t3_fyxzfh,1586587692.0,"That sounds rough. Life is difficult enough right now without dealing with a breakup. However, sadness and anxiety seem like pretty normal emotions considering all that going on."
relationship_advice,fn2f9dy,t1_fn2epu8,1586586952.0,"That sounds like a start. I hope the best for you. As tragic as this is, just remember that you have a lot of years ahead of you. I couldn't see that 15 years ago.

Good luck!"
relationship_advice,fn2dve0,t1_fn2ddk3,1586585616.0,"No fucking way. How is that using her anyway if she's living there too?

She doesn't need to know your intentions just as you didn't know hers.

I would be filling for unemployment and getting your own place asap. I'd imagine she has too much control of the situation between you two if y'all are living together."
relationship_advice,fn2d6dy,t1_fn2c55t,1586584954.0,"So, you've already moved out? That would be better than being stuck in a house with someone who did that.

If so, I'd say focus on yourself and where you'll find employment after all this BS is over.

If she's helping you financially because she feels bad, good. She should. I'd string her along until you're back on your feet.

If she's pushing too much for interaction that you're not comfortable with, just tell her you need some time to buy yourself some.

Once you're independent again, you'll be able to look at this through different lenses."
relationship_advice,fn2b99w,t3_fyww2p,1586583233.0,To answer your question: practice. Indepence and feeling content doesn't come on it's own for everyone.
relationship_advice,fn2ahpw,t3_fywza0,1586582551.0,"I feel for ya because you're married. You painted a lifelong picture in your head, I assume. To see that crumbling down can't be easy.

That being said, you're young, and it's better to find out now that your wife doesn't know what commitment is. I say, try to see her for what she's done to you and cut your losses. Sorry.

My wife and I have said and done everything in the book to each other except cheat on each other. I just don't see the point of being married with infidelity.

Hope that helps."
