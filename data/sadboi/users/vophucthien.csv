Chẳng những bố chăm lo cho con mà còn cho cả Hayden và mẹ bằng cách làm việc từ sáng sớm, và con chỉ muốn nói cảm ơn bố cho tất cả những gì bố đã làm. Con ước con có đủ tiền để đặt cho bố mẹ một kì nghỉ vào ngày sinh nhật bố. Khi con đi làm và kiếm tiền, đó là điều đầu tiên con sẽ làm để trả ơn cho công lao của bố. Con không có đủ can đảm để nói trực tiếp điều này với bố, nhưng con muốn bố biết rằng con yêu bố rất nhiều dù con không nói ra. Con muốn nói rằng con rất quý trọng tất cả những sự hy sinh và sự cần cù mà bố đã dành cho con để nuôi con lớn khôn, và con rất tự hào vì có một người bố như vậy. Con xin lỗi vì không thể bày tỏ tình yêu của con dành cho bố và không luôn luôn cố hết sức làm một người con ngoan với bố mẹ. Nhưng con hứa với bố rằng từ nay trở đi, con sẽ luôn đặt lên hàng đầu những điều quan trọng nhất để bù đắp công ơn bố mẹ. Chúc bố có một tuổi 50 hạnh phúc, sống một cuộc sống dài và sung túc trong nhiều năm tới.

Con yêu bố.""

TL;DR: Bigger sensors are better at taking portrait photos since they isolate the subject from the background well.
