Stay - Sam Foster (Ewan McGregor), a psychiatrist, has a new patient, Henry Letham (Ryan Gosling), who claims to be suicidal. In trying to diagnose him, Sam visits Henry's prior therapist (Janeane Garofalo) and also finds Henry's mother -- even though Henry has said that he murdered both of his parents. As reality starts to contradict fact, Sam spirals into an unstable mental state. Then he finds a clue as to how and when Henry may try to kill himself, and races to try to stop him.

The Jacket - Amnesiac Gulf War veteran Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) can't explain why he's been found at the scene of a murder. Ordered to a mental hospital, Jack is subjected to Dr. Thomas Becker's (Kris Kristofferson) unusual treatment plan, which involves mysterious injections, sensory deprivation and confinement in a straitjacket. Locked away on his own, Jack discovers he can travel to the future, where he's compelled to help a onetime acquaintance (Keira Knightley) and investigate his own odd fate.

Requiem for a dream - Imaginatively evoking the inner landscape of human beings longing to connect, to love and feel loved, the film is a parable of happiness gloriously found and tragically lost. ""Requiem for a Dream"" tells parallel stories that are linked by the relationship between the lonely, widowed Sara Goldfarb and her sweet but aimless son, Harry. The plump Sara, galvanized by the prospect of appearing on a TV game show, has started on a dangerous diet regimen to beautify herself for a national audience.

Ticking Clock - A reporter (Cuba Gooding Jr.) stumbles upon the journal of a murderer replete with plans to butcher specific people, and investigates on his own, finding that every trail leads to a 9-year-old orphan living in a group home.

Memento - Leonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. The difficulty, however, of locating his wife's killer is compounded by the fact that he suffers from a rare, untreatable form of memory loss. Although he can recall details of life before his accident, Leonard cannot remember what happened fifteen minutes ago, where he's going, or why.

Eyes Wide Shut - After Dr. Bill Hartford's (Tom Cruise) wife, Alice (Nicole Kidman), admits to having sexual fantasies about a man she met, Bill becomes obsessed with having a sexual encounter. He discovers an underground sexual group and attends one of their meetings -- and quickly discovers that he is in over his head.

Seven - When retiring police Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) tackles a final case with the aid of newly transferred David Mills (Brad Pitt), they discover a number of elaborate and grizzly murders. They soon realize they are dealing with a serial killer (Kevin Spacey) who is targeting people he thinks represent one of the seven deadly sins. Somerset also befriends Mills' wife, Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), who is pregnant and afraid to raise her child in the crime-riddled city.

Dark City - John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) awakens alone in a strange hotel to find that he is wanted for a series of brutal murders. The problem is that he can't remember whether he committed the murders or not. For one brief moment, he is convinced that he has gone completely mad. Murdoch seeks to unravel the twisted riddle of his identity. As he edges closer to solving the mystery, he stumbles upon a fiendish underworld controlled by a group of ominous beings collectively known as the Strangers."

relationship_advice,fmqrf8f,t1_fmqp717,1586305447.0,"Great!!! I really wish you two the best and that things go back to normal for both of your happiness

Don't feel crazy about him treating others better, it can be a mask to hide how he trully feels and not show his emotional stress, definetly sounds he feels safe with you and maybe he treats you different cuz he thinks you won't mind and his able to let out his true colors of his feelings, especially since he broke down to you and couldn't talk about it after! Also he did choose to quarintine along your side!! So definetly I assume he cares for you and likes your company and bassically are his main rock!! :)"
relationship_advice,fmpgy2z,t3_fwof6n,1586280644.0,"Harsh to say, but let her go man, your just gonna keep on torturing yourself with emotions, she clearly lost the interest, definetly saw something in you and it turned out it wasn't what she expected, as simple as that, so yeah move on, stop chasing her, if you have mutual friends keep distance from her and keep it hi and bye with her unless she's the one that initiates conversation, would be really cool if you do get to patch things up and keep a friendship but yeah don't focus on that now as you need to get her out of your system to move on lol so yeah man work on getting a different girl, and most importantly keep hitting them books!!!"
relationship_advice,fmpfb6d,t3_fwo7np,1586279814.0,"I think this sounds like your kinda being selfish and your insecurities are the main damage in this, work on that for both of your happiness, get some confidence that someone can be with you because they like the way you are, sounds like he's just having a really hard time, your probabilly his main rock right now so if he's not treating anyone better or more special then you that's a good sign that it is not you doing something wrong and it's him dealing with things so don't let the negativity get to you, give him some space and show alot of affection to him, surprise him, cook him some nice meals, small things so he can cope better!!"

relationship_advice,fmpbyln,t3_fwnizq,1586278116.0,"This is a tough situation your in! Lol move away as far as you can alone with your bf? Lol j/k

Ok, well I gotta say great job how your handling this, really well done!! Your definelty not just overthinking this situation as it looks shady, well good thing it sounds like bf is seriously interested in you, but she sounds really bad/toxic individual, I would recommend to wait it out a bit longer since like I said the problem seams to be her and not your bf, so if things get worse talk to him about it later, since she is a ""important"" roll on your bf, his friends, and family, try not to do the me or her thing, but if you do strongly feel he starts prioritizing her over you who is his official actual girlfriend, it might be smart to move along, but wait a bit longer before taking decisions, you have been coping really well so a bit longer I think you can handle, goodluck hope all resolves well!"

Personally there's nothing wrong with liking someone in a relationship, but ok don't wanna sound like a dick but be realistic and ask yourself do you have a chance? Is there a chance of her that likes you back? If no then yes unfollow her cuz those updates and pictures are gonna bother you and if you keep seeing that you will never get over her!"
mentalhealth,fmp6smg,t1_fmp5suc,1586275497.0,"Hey just re read your post lol 

Please don't answer my 1st question

My previous post feels meaningless and dumb to me now lol

Stay sober! You don't need to break that to enjoy this time alone!! but I do get where your coming from and especially if your home alone, can be really tempting,  especially if your bored out of your mind!! So I recommend try to keep somehow bussy and stuff mainly to get that feeling off your mind! Goodluck :)"
mentalhealth,fmp5suc,t3_fwmmlz,1586274970.0,"Hope you don't mind this question but what where you hooked on?? 

To tell you about myself, I'm heavily into getting my mind altered and have always loved that since a early young age, I also don't see myself ever being completely sober

Now here is the thing, over the time I got burned out of it, was getting out of control and I was always doing dumb things, saying them, and just not enjoying it anymore, people around me didn't mind it but I did, felt like a asshole piece of shit, so I would be mentally fucked up man and really affected by my  actions I would feel physically sick

Anyways few months back I started to take the route of avoiding going out and the usual binges, decided to stop drugs and cut back on my drinking, I did this without telling my friends pretty much just not hanging out as usual, then I started to appreciate and enjoy my time alone and do different activities, saving money and everything that came along, then this lockdown situation happend and it's badass to me!"
relationship_advice,fmp4sex,t3_fwmnnb,1586274434.0,"Move on man, you two are in a different page, also if she said no respect that and don't convince her or pressure her just for your needs, she will regret that in the long run especially if it doesn't work out between you two and you will always be that jerk to her that she lost it too just cuz you wanted it!

Anyways on the bright side if you do decide to move on and let her go, think of it this way, you already had one girl friend, you can for sure find another one!!

Goodluck man!!!"
mentalhealth,fmp3n1u,t3_fwlzuy,1586273810.0,"Idk if it's possible to learn how to mute your mind since that's a normal human feature but there is people who are born with no inner dialogue(which means they dont have a voice inside their head) and also without a minds eye(which is when there's no visuals inside your mind) both these make them process information different than normal people, really interesting stuff and recomended you to look it up, read some stuff on it or YouTube some videos, again this is a born condition and they have been adapted to this method since birth, it was not caused by training ect to them is just normal and in alot of cases they are not even aware they are different and process information different than others

To answer your question, it takes alot of practice but here's a tip that worked for me to stop bad mental habbits, Try to catch yourself as soon as these thoughts and memories start, tell yourself their just bad memories! Repeat this and After a few times of practice it becomes easier to cope and bad feelings go away easier, I use to even laugh as soon as I catch bad thoughts and talk myself out ""like ahh I see you, not today"" kinda weird but helped me alot lol also make up a mantra, pretty much you wanna train your mind to think positive and throw away the negative, that way your body/feelings will start feeling positive, so you gotta train it by repeating things, kinda like when your on a diet and your like no, nope not gonna eat that! Takes will power, but all Is possible, so I hope that can help you"
relationship_advice,fmp0wdg,t3_fwm02f,1586272279.0,"Dosnt sound like your nagging him tbh, I would advice you to ahead talk to him and make it clear to him your really interested in him and like him for how he is, find him attractive ect, dosnt sound like he dosnt like you and more like he has personal insecurity or something is holding him back so yeah"
relationship_advice,fmoxqs1,t3_fwkr00,1586270577.0,"Yeah sounds like you are over thinking it too much, maybe even beings a bit possessive or selfish? give her some space, if you haven't done nothing wrong to hurt her feelings why are you over worried? Especially in these situations we are living in the US we can be going through alot, for instance I havent talked to my close friends quite in a while over the phone, just simple short txt, it's a stresfull situation we are in and some people want space and hang with their families, or pretty much be lazy, sleep in, ect do you have other friends aswell? Does she have other friends too? She can be bussy communicating with them too or something, Also I get it, you guys are great and have a great bond and things but it definelty sounds like you have a hope of romantic interest in her!! Just that something is holding you back from taking that stage, I assume that cuz ive been there before and it sucks lol over a fit we stopped talking and never heard from each other from our pride, so that's my next point, people can change as time goes by, you will be surprised alot by that as you grow and realise it, circles and crowds change, friends branch off, there's new people coming in, you start getting along with old friends, all that, im basically saying this to let you know that sometimes no matter how perfect it seams and hard you try, change can happen and that's ok cuz that's life! I surelly hope and wish you the best"

Not saying anything is wrong with you but there's just no romantic connection from her side, she doesn't click with you on that level, she just dosnt wanna make it clear to you perhaps? She also sounds like she wants nothing serious and wants just to have fun and meet different people, she may care for you alot and find you amazing and important and a priority to her but just as a friend, Move on as hard as that sounds! Your just hurting yourself!!"

She doesn't have a scar as ive never seen it and I play with her and have picked her up

What you said makes sense to me! theres also other stray male cats in the block but she doesn't go too far from our building from what that I know of/seen so the reason can be that, anyways thanks it's good to know it's just some sort of cat communication thing lol"
NoStupidQuestions,fmokh5s,t3_fwjcg9,1586261799.0,"Hey is it mainly to lose weight? Or just a healthy way of living your aiming for?

Nutrition is really important and well explained if you research and read on it, there's alot of delicious meals and options out there I'm sure you can find and can cook up!! It's more of a dedicated lifestyle and alot of discipline

In my case I'm pretty healthy imo, that's how I feel and I'm happy, sure could be in top notch shape, but I'm satisifed where I'm at, there's oviously foods I stay away from and only eat out here and there, so yeah the most important thing to do is feel good about yourself and focus on avoiding what it's clearly unhealthy for your health!"

Sounds like your not a bad person and your very lucky and well determined since you sound successful

What makes you feel this way?? Is it your thoughts that YOU feel unworthy and evil??

Will give you a short run up since I was the same way, I hated myself in a way I can't explain, masked it up really well, no one noticed, everyone would say I was great but I was deep inside unhappy and miserable, I couldn't accept nice things, Everytime I would be interested in a girl (many times) I would tell myself she can do better, stuff like that, once a teacher made a comment saying your smart since I had a solved a problem in a different way over the correct way and got the correct answer, I literally couldn't accept that comment and my eyes got watery, I went thru hell, got help and worked on my sanity and over time I started to built myself up from these bad habbits and terrible feelings I felt and finally noticed alot of my problems where deep in my head, that I was the one from stopping myself to be happy, so hope somehow you figure it out and start feeling well, enjoy your life and be positive!!!!"

If you need space then go for it, and don't mind his feelings cuz what you feel in the end is more important than just staying with him because he's nice and sweet to you, this opinion is based on how I would feel if someone was with me even though I would be heartbroken I would prefer to know there's no more romantic interest on me and move along"

breaking up a relationship on purpose, being the side girl, spreading gossip, ect 

All that stuff is more common that you can imagine, even normal to say in the traits of certain ""healthy minded"" people

A bad manipulative example to me would for instance making your partner kill himself just because you cant break up with him and that benefits you to become single, or seducing people when you have aids or something in that extent
