For essentia family she said it would be like 1:1 in each room (wild!) But that was all she said for that. It was at the end of our zoom meeting so nothing was really clarified or anything.

Oh I just remembered she said temps taken of everyone and parents drop off outside.

We stayed open until April 1st, and by that point we were working 6 hour days and I only had a handful of kids, with two teachers in the room (and another with 2 infants in another room).

I'm honestly not mentally prepared to go back. Not prepared to wear a mask all day and not prepared to be potentially bringing this home to my family.
