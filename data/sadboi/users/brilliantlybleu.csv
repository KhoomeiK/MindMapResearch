rape,fhdyc98,t3_f2pdp1,1581507513.0,"First of all, I’m so so sorry this happened to you. You didn’t deserve it. And that man deserves all the pain in the world for what he did. But it’s okay if you’re struggling with how you feel about it. I’m going to try to explain why I think you might be feeling bad for him. 

In moments of trauma, sometimes the brain will take insane leaps of rationalization in order to cope. It might be easier for your brain to cope with what happened if it rationalizes that this person is sorry for what happened. It wants to think that this person isn’t so bad, and therefore, that what they did to you wasn’t that bad. Your brain wants to trick you into thinking it wasn’t a big deal, because that’s a whole lot easier than admitting that it was. When faced with severe  trauma like this, the brain’s first reaction is often to either deny that it happened or deny that it was that bad (often through rationalization like “he’s sorry” or “he didn’t mean it”) simply because that’s less painful, at least at first. 

In summary, your brain is just trying to cope. One might compare your experience to Stockholm syndrome. Your brain is trying to survive after trauma, and in order to do that, it’s tricking you into feeling bad for the rapist so that you can cope with the rape. 

Just know that it isn’t your fault if you feel bad for him. It’s a common reaction of rape victims. That feeling will go away with time. Go easy on yourself and surround yourself with loved ones. Please take care."
relationship_advice,fh1qs9l,t1_fh1oia6,1581221496.0,Completely agree with you here
relationship_advice,fh1ppns,t3_f0qhj3,1581220613.0,"Like everyone has said, my heart absolutely breaks for you and your wife. You wanted a child, you raised that child, you loved that child, and now that child doesn’t seem to see you as his real parents. I hope that with age he will learn how much he has hurt you both with this. 

Again, repeating what I’ve read in the comments, it seems like John is enjoying all of the vacation/fun time with Sam and his family. John might be mistaking all that vacation time for being his potential “other life,” and that if he moved with Sam, that life would be fun all the time. He doesn’t seem to understand the implications of moving out. 

I do strongly believe that John should not move into Sam’s home. He is your son. You raised him when Sam couldn’t. I think it’s selfish (though likely just naive) of John to want to leave for greener pastures when you and your wife have been struggling lately and are “less fun” than Sam’s youthful family.  John should stay with his parents, which are you and your wife. He should be allowed to visit and hang out with Sam, but no more than he should be allowed for any sort of friend in his life. Sam can grow to be a very close friend of John’s, but he is NOT John’s father. You are. Just because a boy likes hanging out with his friend more than his parents doesn’t mean it’s in his best interest to move out. Sam gave up his parental rights, and it would be unfair to claim
them now after you’ve done the hard work of raising John, even when it wasn’t easy. 

There isn’t any doubt that your son and Sam have a good connection that won’t disappear anytime soon. I might suggest that you consider moving closer to Sam’s family. Maybe it would be helpful if your home and Sam’s were closer, so that your son could move between them more fluidly without feeling the need to leave you entirely.

I understand that your love of your son is probably what’s making you think it’s better to let him go. You love him, and you want him to be happy, and you might even feel that Sam is a better fit to be John’s father. But that isn’t true. You and your wife chose to take in this baby and raise him. Sam chose to let him go (regardless that it was in the best thing to do in his situation). You will always be a better father to John than Sam could ever be. John may not see that yet, but he will. You may be doubting yourself now, but I want to let you know that you are an incredible father for loving your son as much as you do. 

I hope that you reach a solution that you find peace in.

depression,fd8zm0d,t3_ekbvjq,1578225925.0,"A lot of times, it’s hard to open up about depression because it’s like digging into a wound. Sometimes, it’s better to just ignore it and enjoy the times that are somewhat good with the people you love, rather than spend that time delving into what makes you depressed. 

However, opening up on occasion is also healthy. I would say that if you want to help your friend, you’re already doing a great job with what I see in this post. Recognizing that what they will tell you is difficult to understand and empathize with, but STILL wanting to listen, is a great step. As a depressed person, I fear that opening up to a non-depressed friend will lead to two things: 1) they will say “oh I get that completely” and dismiss my feelings and experiences entirely, or 2) that they will be so uncomfortable with my depression that they will forcibly change the subject. The fact that you understand that your friend’s experiences are unique and difficult is very helpful. 

Overall, I would say that you should just try to hold out an open offer to listen whenever you think he’s having a rough time, and if he says no, don’t push it and just offer again next time. Basically, keep the door open, but don’t try to pull him through. Can’t emphasize this enough. 

Let him know pretty much what you’ve said here: that you care about him and want to help, and that you *still* care about him when he’s depressed. Let him drive the conversation about his own depression, and be an active listener. 

You’re doing great OP, and I wish you luck."
depression,fd8y1ng,t3_ekbumb,1578225181.0,"I get this feeling a lot. I’ve been depressed for half my life. It feels exhausting imagining myself living  even another 5 or 10 years, when I know my natural lifespan is more like 50 to 60 more years. I think about suicide all the time when I think about how much longer I have to live. 

But, I know that suicide is not the answer, no matter how much I wish I could. So the way that I cope is by, instead of looking at my future in a matter of years, to process it one day at a time. I don’t have to live another 10 years, I just have to live until tomorrow. I just have to get through this day. And then the next day, I tell myself the same thing. 

It can be even more helpful to take larger chunks, like months, and frame them around what you’re looking forward too. I don’t have to live another 10 years, I just have to live until next month when my favorite video game gets a sequel. I just have to live until June, when I’m supposed to go on a trip with my loved ones. I just have to live until December, so I can see the snow fall again. Little things are great. 

Anyways, good luck OP. I hope to see you next year. Take care"
depression,fd8x566,t1_fd8wznl,1578224758.0,"Oh and since I’m dumb and forgot to explicitly say this, what you talk about experiencing here are all symptoms of depression, and exactly what a psychiatrist will ask you about."
depression,fd8wznl,t3_ekbysh,1578224689.0,"OP, I’ve been in your place before. I thought I couldn’t be depressed and I had to be faking it, even though I had all the symptoms. The very first time I went to see a psychiatrist I got immediately diagnosed. It was a shock, but in retrospect, completely obvious. It makes sense that a person with all or many of the symptoms would have the illness. But depression does funny things to your brain. If you’re even *worried* about “faking it,” you’re not. If you were faking it you would just be faking it. 

I won’t diagnose you, but I will strongly, strongly encourage that you see a professional psychiatrist as soon as you can. Personally, it helped me to be validated with a diagnosis, so I could finally tell that voice in my head that I’m not evil and faking it, that I have a genuine medical problem. It felt freeing to be able to label it, rather than grow to hate myself more. 

Anyways, sorry if I’m talking about myself too much, I’m just trying to explain that I completely understand how you feel right now. And I have to say, you have plenty of reasons to look into a diagnosis. You are NOT faking it. Good luck, OP"

relationship_advice,fc52ks7,t3_eg8xw5,1577439837.0,"It’s possible that she wants to consider polyamory, but it’s also possible that she’s worried she isn’t enough for you. Maybe she’s worried about holding you back, and wants to give you as much freedom as possible so you don’t resent her. This might stem from a previous relationship, but I can’t say.

relationships,fc3subf,t3_eg1cpr,1577397746.0,"As someone with depression who suffers similarly to your boyfriend, I have to say that he’s taking advantage of you and your kindness. Letting yourself go when you’re alone is one thing, but fully leaning into someone to take care of you 100% is another. He is unfairly putting too much responsibility of his own well being on you. Maybe he doesn’t realize it, but he’s certainly too comfortable with using you as a doormat. Relationships are partnerships. You need to have a serious discussion about him taking his journey to get help more seriously. He can’t continue to use you as a comfort zone, allowing him to stop trying to change or get better. I understand you love him and it’s really hard to feel like you’re leaving him out to dry, but trust me, he needs some real consequences if he’s ever going to get out of this safe space of relying on you. It’ll be better for the both of you if you start to draw boundaries. And in the end, if he completely refuses to try and continues to use you at his disposal, it’s okay to leave. You don’t need to set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm."
