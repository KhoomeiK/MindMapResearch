I don’t doubt for one moment that there are many Muslims in this world who are decent and honorable. People who I would be proud to stand and die beside. Even I concede that some Muslims don’t get enough respect.

However, I am also not stupid. The right’s aversion to Islam may seem harsh, but Muslim gang rape is kind of harsh, too. No, not all Muslims do such things. But enough of them do that for me, it’s a problem. Sorry, I just don’t like innocent people being hurt. And it’s not our job to take in every Muslim on the planet.

Now, there are plenty of other groups in this world that have dangerous elements in them. It’s not just Muslims. This is why it’s best to end (or at least severely limit all immigration. (There are other reasons too.)

Regarding foreign policy: I actually agree with you - more or less anyway. I do NOT believe it is our job to bring the gospel of democracy to the Middle East. Nor to conduct nation-building campaigns, nor to fix any of their own conflicts. Even if it was our responsibility to do all those things, history has shown that we tend to train and arm all the wrong people (usually with enthusiastic support from both the left and right). Most or all of our troops in the Middle East should be brought home and put on our border.

I also question the ongoing demonization of Iran. No, they are not a perfect country, and I’m definitely not saying they’re our best friend. But in short they are one of the most well-educated and civilized of the Islamic nations. We don’t need to kiss their rear or give them any handouts, but I don’t think we need to start any wars with them if it can be avoided. Of course, if they (or any nation) attacked us, we should respond without mercy.

Last thing, and I’ll shut up. We need to stop all welfare payments (“foreign aid”) to every Middle Eastern nation - including Israel. I think this, along with greatly reduced immigration would go a long way.

In our family it has been helpful to let the child watch the parent/older sibling of the same sex use the potty. Sometimes we gently talk them into using the toddler potty simultaneously. Even if they just sit on it without actually going, that’s still a small victory imo. I make a point to just randomly ask “Do you want to go use the potty?” several times throughout the day. With one of our kids, we used a potty watch. ie, it has a musical alarm that you can program to go off every x minutes/hours. Whenever the alarm goes off, it’s potty time. Make a game of it. We don’t get real firm or force anything until we feel they are ready, and I honestly think that is going to be a different age for every child. Not every child is trained instantly. I think sometimes it has to happen *very* gradually. Nothing in your post makes me think you must be a failure.

AskConservatives,fptxod7,t3_gfetav,1588900358.0,"I will give you my response, although it is not shared by most conservatives:

In instances like school shootings or bombings, we usually have overwhelming evidence of the perpetrator’s identity. ie, security camera footage, eyewitness testimony from survivors as well as law enforcement, DNA when needed, etc. 

When we have that irrefutable mountain of proof that person X deliberately murdered multiple innocent people, I believe they should undergo significant corporeal punishment, followed by execution. 

To answer your other question, I support responsible and legal gun ownership for a few reasons. When you find yourself the victim of a home invasion, attempted kidnapping, assault, or worse, law enforcement can’t always be there within the seconds or less that would be needed for them to save you. That’s not a criticism of law enforcement; it’s just the practical reality we live in. And there are criminals out there that don’t even need a gun to kill you. 

I actually respect leftists for pointing out the fact that innocent people do die every year from firearms. Guns are fatal weapons, and ownership is not to be undertaken lightly. However, this is not enough to convince me that we should simply ban them all. Guns are also used to save a lot of lives. 

Tens of thousands die from car accidents every year, but we don’t ban automobiles. Tens of thousands acquire or die from HIV every year, but we don’t outlaw sexual intercourse.
