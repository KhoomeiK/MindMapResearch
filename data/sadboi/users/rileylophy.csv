DysmorphicDisorder,f39wqon,t3_de3hqx,1570757181.0,"You want to be something that you never can achieve because this person doesn't exist. You have you. I feel the same way. I play, pretend to be something I think others may see as 'good' such as taking substances to pretend I'm something else, someone else. I hear you, looks seem like everything at some vulnerable times. You are more than an outside person perceived by others. You have an inside, you can come back to yourself, project, live from the inside. That is what I hope to do. Emotional abuse will make you leave yourself. That's very valid. I have felt emotional abuse since my earliest memories, not that I completely know what it is like for you. I just want to let you know You aren't alone, your real self exists right here, right now, and there's more to life than just a projection of yourself that you see and perceive yourself to be."

     Thank you for pointing that out, gnosiscna. I feel that’s something perhaps overlooked. Our relationship to BAD foods, that we may only eat in private. I’m not comfortable myself yet to even do what she did, it’s so inspiring. What do you think about secret eating of foods; any more thoughts you have on it? 

     I’m struggling with eating during the day, and I make my boyfriend do takeout so we don’t eat in public, I feel picky and listen to Ana during the day, yet change into a sloppy, gross person (in my own head, still feels real but is not) that eats more until I’m full. Then I feel that the weight is put on me, I’m completely a different sort of person, I feel disgusting in my own body when I eat around others, yet disgust myself on my own, just fighting and wounding myself. 

     I’m vegan as well, so I already feel isolated in my eating. I am vegan for moral reasons, but it is making me sick and less sociable. 
     
     I recently dropped a lot of weight, not meaning to or doing anything differently. Now I feel more obsessed about body dysmorphia. The more I think about the scale, the more it triggers phobic, debilitating thoughts of binging that I don’t and haven’t done in so long. My image of what my body’s appearance is and how body dysmorphia plays a huge part of what I eat.

      Do you think any of all my ranting(haha) can come from Depersonalization Disorder or at least plays a role in my ED?"
EatingDisorders,exg3cfp,t1_eueza8b,1566254537.0,I agree. That was such an insightful description of our culture and the cycle of dieting industry. It’s such a major part of ED’s. Thanks for your thoughts ❤️
