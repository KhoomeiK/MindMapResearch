I'm sorry you never had a celebratory holiday growing up."
bipolar,esmzd8f,t1_eskqjvm,1562118822.0,Seriously ... I'm like everyone loves me and everyone needs me and I am going to start a cultural revolution.
bipolar,eqpfp26,t1_eq99ydc,1560199165.0,"Exactly ... I can ""appear"" normal because I know what I should or would do when I'm not manic or depressed. It just takes every ounce of energy and like I said it's like having a second full time job to appear that way."
bipolar,eqpfcw4,t1_eq9agku,1560199064.0,"There are so many people with all types of mental health diagnosis , I wish it wasn't so taboo /stigma that it does because we are awesome people .... just need a little help keeping balance.

I'm open with what I've struggled with in Hope's that it becomes ok for people to seek help if they need to !"
bipolar,eqpex70,t1_eq9kafl,1560198926.0,Exactly. Fortunately I've had a job out in the field so ADHD was manageable.  Sitting at a desk... I probably would have failed.

bipolar,eq90w6c,t3_bxpoqs,1559881767.0,"I wasn't officially diagnosed until my early 30s with BP2, BPD and ADHD. I had successful relationships, great jobs and was overall successful in terms of having these mental health diagnosis. 
I've been down the darkest of paths and made decisions others questioned very frequently but at the end of the day I took responsibility seriously and always managed to continue growing.  Then life just exploded in my face and months later, hours of resting , 5 psychiatrists, several therapists and hospital visits... I now knew what i had.
I was functional but the work it took to be ""normal "" or functional was a second job always and it was exhausting even though I didn't realize it at the time. Years later, lots of therapy and cocktail of a few different drugs my life is sooooo much easier, my mind far more peaceful and my episodes are self managed without me going to far off the deep end in either direction. I am comfortable sharing my diagnosis with others especially those closest to me and its helped relationships that were already great blossom into so much more !"

bipolar,eohvz2y,t3_bry6ty,1558598953.0,"Me! I even had a friend take me to high end stores for a ""shopping "" spree. I didn't actually get anything but I felt like a queen for a day and really thought all those goodies were going to be at my house.

This did not happen and I ended up living in a dream for a couple of months before my crazy mixed episode went away and my harsh reality set in.... whooops"
AskReddit,eohvukg,t3_bru8zt,1558598740.0,"My father promised me an ostrich egg on the way home from camping so that I could hatch it and have an ostrich (along with every other animal I already had).... I did not get to hatch and raise an ostrich. 

I was especially upset when I hit 14 years and really wanted him to be a Chocobo had I had one."
