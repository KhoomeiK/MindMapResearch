EatingDisorders,fc3w1fv,t3_efqc15,1577400083.0,"Okay so you’re going down the path of an ED. I started out calorie counting and it ruined me, fast forward five years later and I’m still recovering from my binging and purging spells. Please get help and save yourself since you’re still early in it."
heartbreak,eyr2wrs,t1_eyjvunp,1567359887.0,"Sounds like a situationship. I’m sorry that it’s not more and the official relationship that you may want. It’s good to look back on the times that you had with that person because there were good times and definitely much to learn. And you can transfer what you learned to your next relationship with someone who wants the same as you. That’s what I’ll do, but taking time to re-find myself is what is most important."

EatingDisorders,es626q4,t3_c5yy29,1561638173.0,"I love this, I love this so much. Congrats, I hope I can one day get to your level, you’re showing me that it’s possible. Keep up the great work, you’ve truly come far ."
EatingDisorders,erxus2d,t3_c4mip1,1561393987.0,"I myself am in a similar boat, and so far I’ve been pretty good at avoiding the number. I was in a dark place with calorie counting and binging/purging. And I’m still on the road to recovery but I have come a long way and I’ve stopped restricting myself less and did end up gaining weight, but I coupled that was going to the gym and I know that a good portion of the weight is muscle, and I’m not an obsessive gym goer either, I just go about 3 times a week for 60 minutes and do some cardio and weight training. Try to think about how you felt about yourself before hearing your weight, and remember that you’re still that same person and that one number doesn’t define you. For losing or maintaining weight I would say probably picking up an activity that you like to do or going to the gym with friends. It also just makes you feel like you’re doing something good and it’s good for a healthy lifestyle ."
EatCheapAndHealthy,eqa8v12,t3_bxrot0,1559927867.0,"Well I’d recommend canned/frozen veggies. Adding Regular potatoes and sweet potatoes to dishes, cooking chicken breasts/buying them in bulk (it’s more expensive upon purchase, but saves you money in the long run). I’m in a similar rut, where I’m trying to eat healthy, but also affordably. So to make up for protein I usually have Greek yogurt, peanut butter, or eggs with turkey bacon.  I usually buy a tub of Greek yogurt and add in raw oats with honey, or have oats with milk, peanut butter, honey, and add in banana. Another option is that I’ll make and egg, turkey bacon, sandwich with multigrain bread. Eggs also go a long way if you’re familiar with Asian dishes and adding it to rice/noodles. For dinner/lunch I’ll have some form of starchy vegetable (ie. Corn, sweet potato, etc.) with some type of green, and add a form of protein to it like chicken breast, chicken/turkey sausages (one sausage makes four meals for me!, also easy to cook). Also simple deli meat sandwiches are thing too. I occasionally buy fish because it is on the pricier side, but buying the packaged tuna is cheap and another good protein source."
EatingDisorders,eq8vmpp,t3_bts0ve,1559876740.0,"As a person who has had an eating disorder for almost 3 years and is into the gym/fit life. I can say that going to the gym has helped lessen the intensity of my ED, and I do see it possible that one day I could stop completely. I’ve noticed it in other people with EDs who stopped and transitioned over to going to the gym. But I can’t say that it’s an unhealthy thing in the same was that my ED is and it’s nowhere nearly as obsessive. So I think it’s genuinely possible for some influencers claims to be true, but other could have just replaced their old habit with a new one?"
