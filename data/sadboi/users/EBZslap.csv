Harrison tactically fought him on the back foot evading most of Charlos big shots and having the better of the opening exchanges your boy Charlo was hitting gloves and arms all night long making fans like you believe his hype. And you love to bring up the fact Harrison was using his jab a lot, no shit mastermind he is a counter puncher against an aggresive brawler he has
to use the jab for the distance. Also Harrison's lunging left hook was more effective then any shot Charlo threw just wild horrible punches. This fight showed the difference between a pure boxer and a brawler."
