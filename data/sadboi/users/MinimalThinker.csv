Before that I was in Ben Dunne by Jervis St and in comparison Flyefit is much better. I think most/all gyms will be busy in the evenings when people finish work and I've found some of the Flyefit gyms can get quite overcrowded if there aren't separate areas for classes but considering the price and number of locations it's worth it.

I'm in no way a professional but to me it sounds like you might have some form of anxiety/OCD/self-esteem/body image issues. If you spoke to a general therapist or your family doctor they should be able to direct you/offer you help.

Just a little addition, high-carb foods aren't necessarily bad because they're high in carbs. Carbs are one of the three main macronutrients alongside fat and protein."

I'm from a very rural area originally, 20 minute drive to the nearest town, 30 minutes to the next nearest in the opposite direction. My parents' house is a 2-3 minute walk from the local church which is the local dealing spot for well over a decade. The local priest called them out on it during mass when they just started when I was an alter boy so I asked my sister about it at the time (she's 7 years older than me) and she filled me in on the story and how coke was their main sale, not weed like many would expect.

I'm in my mid-20s now and it's become so popular with a lot of people I know (not necessarily friends). I think it's a drug that once you have disposable income a lot of people think ""sure, why not?"" almost like it's a status symbol or they're too mature for MDMA, weed or ket."

I think because you're boyfriend has been through something similar he will be able to help you hugely, my mother assumed that role for me. 

The most important thing is to get medical help, even if others tell you that you don't need it. I didn't want to get medical help because I was afraid of being diagnosed with depression but because I went to my doctor he was able to refer me to a psychiatrist. Ask someone to go to the doctor with you as a further support if you need it but you are not a burden. You would seek medical advice if you had a broken bone and this is no different.

Seeking help is looking after yourself and those who love you will recognise that. You can do it, OP. I believe you can!"

This Brexiter idea is becoming almost as popular as the theory that German carmakers would demand a good deal for the UK. It is built on a similar misunderstanding of EU interests.

Neither Poland nor Hungary have anything to gain from frustrating the other 26 by vetoing an extension for Boris Johnson. Both are net recipients of EU funds and have their own fights with Brussels.

These countries’ reluctance to spend political capital on the UK was demonstrated at one EU summit. In front of the cameras, Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, kissed Theresa May’s hand and told journalists he was opposed to “punishing the British”. Inside the privacy of the summit chamber, when he had the chance to speak for the UK, he said nothing.""
