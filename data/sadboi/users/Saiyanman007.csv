When I was about 11 years old, I nearly died from an asthma attack caused by my mother. My mother was a heavy smoker at the time. This was in the early 90's. Smoking just wasnt seen as that big of a health risk as it is now. 

I was asthmatic as a child. My mother would smoke wirh in the car and in the house and I'd have severe asthma attacks that would cause me to go the the E.R.

All the doctors told her to quit smoking around me, my father just ignored it. I complained.  She continued to smoke around me, in the house. Everywhere. She smoked so much that elementary school had accused me of sneaking cigarettes.

Well...one night... I had the mother of all asthma attacks. Right from the get go I knew something was different. I tried my rescue inhalers, but each puff just shot out my nose. I couldnt get any air in. My airway had completely closed off. I couldn't even talk. 

She had been chain smoking in the house all damn night...I remember that much. Panic setting in. 

I remember running for the front door...trying to make it out to the car, I think, to go the E.R. My mother was still fucking smoking as I collapsed
 I go into respiratory arrest. 

I wake up a few days later, in the I.C.U with a tube down my throat, Foley catheter in, is in both my arms and one in my ankle.

They had to do C.P.R to keep me alive. 

It took her nearly fucking killing me to take what the doctors had been telling her, seriously. She finally quit smoking in the house. Magically, my asthma got better. She still smoked in the car though. 

I hope it never gets that point with your sons life. I just wish someone would have had my back on that, back then, as you do your sons health conditions now. 

TLDR; Mother chained smoked around me as a kid, me being severely asthmatic at the time. One night she was chain smoking in the house that caused an asthma attack that caused respiratory arrest and LOC. It took her nearly killing me to finally realize this was no joke.

I also keep quite to avoid spilling the beans on my crazy side. 

It's as if I'm in a theater, watching a really old film with bad special effects (the kind that make you question the realism of the movie) and blown out speakers that makes everyone sound like they're just talking gibberish, yet all the characters still understand what is being said (and I'm the lead role)...yet the plot continues to play out regardless of my interactions."
