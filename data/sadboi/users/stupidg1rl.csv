spirituality,fma93w6,t3_ftzuc9,1585887054.0,"what the fuck!!!! I swear I started having REALLY weird dreams that all relate to either something I did that day or something that happened recently, they’re really vivid and detailed, much more so than “normal” dreams i’ve had in the past and that’s so weird that so many other people are having em too"
antidepressants,fhrou33,t1_ff93iv2,1581832844.0,"i used to take prozac and wellbutrin combined.. i could always feel the prozac more tho and i hated it too, it gave me insane nightmares and just made me TIRED. i think it would be a good idea if you asked him what he thinks about a different ssri to go w your wellbutrin bc once you find the right balance it really is crazy how much different you will feel"
antidepressants,ff897vr,t3_es5t2d,1579669719.0,"when I started wellbutrin I was extremely irritable and anxious and jittery for about a week or two, my doctor informed me that taking any new sort of antidepressant will take that long for the side effects to tone down. it definitely got better after a couple weeks however it still persisted to a noticeable degree personally so i told my doctor and she upped my SSRI that i’m also taking (lexapro) by .5 milligrams and ever since it’s been the perfect balance. if you take an SSRI along with your wellbutrin consider asking if you should up that dose to decrease the anxious effects, if you don’t take an SSRI consider asking your doctor about one to combine with ur wellbutrin, or maybe take a lower dose of wellbutrin OR just try another antidepressant altogether! very important to tell your doctor/psychiatrist everything!!!! good luck! :)

edit: I started at 150 mg of wellbutrin and moved up to 300 because i didn’t feel enough change; after moving to 300 mg is when the irritability and other side effects began, just for extra info !!"

depression,ezxqj3c,t3_d2pnl8,1568247109.0,"Jesus it’s relieving to know someone else feels this way. I can feel myself starting to forget who I used to be and what I liked or thought was funny or interesting or generally worth my time.  I haven’t hung out with any of my friends in months because I fear they’ll see through my fake ass smile and “I’m okay”s because I don’t feel as tho it’s worth it to try n explain and I don’t like to burden people or worry them, especially because I know they can’t do anything to help me"
depression,ey3z8yw,t3_cv67zm,1566777648.0,"Yep it feels so pointless to explain. And when you actually do, and they don’t get it, I feel so fucking stupid and this is the reason I still haven’t gotten help after a year even tho I’m getting so much worse and I MISS MY OLD SELF I feel like I will never have her back"
