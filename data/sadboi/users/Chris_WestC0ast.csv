I remember reading somewhere that nerfed cards give you a full refund in dust or something, but even then wouldn’t it just be a 1:1 trade off? I’m assuming there’s some way to play the system that has to do with crafting cards that later get nerfed?"

I’m naturally too trusting/ forgiving/ understanding honestly to a fault, but I do have a deep understanding and empathy for people/ animals/ whatever that get shafted by life because it kills me when I see how people just don’t even give an ounce of care for people that are hurting so bad that even just brushing your teeth/ looking in the mirror/ living through a normal day is a brutal fucking grind. It’s like if you’ve never experienced that, you don’t even know it exists so you have zero sympathy for it. But I feel like most people even go a step further and get pleasure/ humor/ some kind of sick enjoyment from sensing that in someone and then verbally and emotionally poking and prodding at it to see your squirm and wriggle in pain and shame. Its like you see this faint, faint twisted smirk on their face and in their eyes, and they’re like a shark smelling blood. I had really bad acne growing up (not comparing to your situation or trying to say that’s equally hard to live with) and I know the exact dismissive, cold, stoic, grossed-out, condescending look you’re talking about, and you’re right it does hurt, it’s fucking soul crushing. I’m not trying to be a messiah or get my ego off by “throwing the freak a bone”, all im saying is that whether you think I’m a “chad” or not, my personality is really the opposite of that, and I just wanted you to know that I truly get it. Maybe not to the extent that you do, but I do get it man."

TikTokCringe,f9age6t,t1_f8u8fx4,1575202420.0,"Yeah bro like snoopsky said, I honestly highly, highly doubt any of your perceived issues have anything at all to do with your height, or even you’d looks for that matter. When you said 5’8.5” my honest to god thought was, “wait, is he serious?” I absolutely would not categorize 5’8.5” as even close to short. It’s honestly your hopeless, helpless, attitude and confirmation bias of wanting your assumptions that all your negative overgeneralizations to be true that repels women. It just oozes like, this dweeby, mouth-breathing, lameness that just makes people feel like, “Jesus, this guy can’t even be helped” so they don’t even want to try, thus wanting to get away from you and not even engage. I’m sorry if that’s harsh but I think you know that deep down. Just stop yourself when you get to that point where you’re like, “see! This is why I’m right that I’m never going to be what women want because they all want _____” You don’t know what they want, because that’s a case-by-case basis thing. Everyone is different and has their own wants, kinks, and things they’re individually attracted to. Like someone in a thread above said she has a thing for eyes, there’s no way you would have ever called that without her saying it. Honestly it’s simple, you just gotta make the decision to put in some effort and not shift responsibility or blame on others (in this case, women). 

Just FYI man, I’m 6’2”, Ive always considered myself decently attractive, always was really popular growing up, and I’m 26 and haven’t had sex in like a bit over a year and a half. “Tall” “dream guys” are unique people with unique problems just like anyone else on the fucking planet. I can’t tell you how many times in the last few years I’ve envied unattractive confident guys who are sure of themselves with a hot ass girlfriend enamored with them. I’ve struggled with super heavy depression and anxiety basically since high school ended. I didn’t have to share that, but I just wanted to just level with you man to man so you know you’re not alone and that the guys you look at don’t have some secret club where we laugh about how perfect life is and how shitty all the “short guys” are. You have everything you need to be the guy you want to be already inside you, just like I do. You just need to keep your head up, not keep digging yourself into a hole, and keep pushing through til things change. But the kicker is, you have to be open and allow them to change"

It’s basically two very close friends (Cody Ko and Noel Miller) who started out as viners, now both do YouTube and have a touring comedy show together. They’re not cringey douchey social media stereotypes at all, don’t worry lol. Basically just them shootin’ the shit, cracking jokes, riffing, talking about current pop culture events, etc."

opiates,f4ujf97,t1_f3exeii,1571813392.0,"Fair enough, I’m not judging man, I’m generally a pretty neutral, passive, open minded person. I didn’t ask that to insinuate you didn’t know what you were talking about, I was just curious about your life experience and why you were so adamant about what you were advising. The reason I asked is because just as a third party who didn’t feel too strongly one way or the other, the net sum of your comments on this thread came off to me as almost bitterly, or spitefully hyper-focused on being independent and not allowing a woman to have an iota of input into his life. Like it came off to me not as a “confident-of-yourself, healthy independence,” but rather as an angry “screw women, don’t EVER let them have an INKLING of control over you no matter what.” (I know you didn’t say those things literally, that’s just the gist of how it came off to me personally) My thoughts here are that logically, considering his original post involved asking for advice on dealing with the situation in relation to his girlfriend, it’s obvious that he cares about her and is trying to navigate and resolve the situation while still considering her feelings and their relationship as a whole. I thought it was a little one-sided that you were going so gung-ho on telling him to basically choose drugs over her and just kick her to the curb for even suggesting that his opiate use worries her and might have negative consequences. And her suggesting that is one in the same with her being a controlling bitch that doesn’t want him to do the things he enjoys. There’s obviously a very clear distinction between the two; the first one comes from a place of caring, worrying about him, and a lack of understanding about drugs, while the other comes from a place of selfishness and control.

Sorry I’m 10 days late lol, I don’t use reddit (TMG reference, anyone?) much, but there’s my $0.02. Cheers!"
opiates,f3edcv7,t1_f3dk1d5,1570870418.0,"You’re right in a way but that seems like such a cop out. If you’re passionate about your career or something in your life, you can, and within reason should try to work towards getting better every hour of every day. Obviously you won’t every waking hour but I feel like the mindset you present is the same quicksand-like mindset that made me start getting into drugs and not living up to my full potential. Finally on the right track career wise, I still use, but idk man. Maybe I’m just projecting my own inner conflict onto you but I feel like thinking that way breeds complacency and settling for less. I’d rather shoot for the moon and hit the stars than convince myself that hitting the stars is just fine and then not even make it out of the atmosphere."

And it is. If you’re doing something above your baseline, that means you pushed yourself beyond your comfort zone. It doesn’t matter what it seems like compared to anyone else, all that matters is compared to YOUR normal, you went above and beyond. Which is fucking awesome. Don’t shame yourself for feeling good about that. The more you can push yourself like that, the more momentum you’ll build, and the better you’ll feel. Good job man."
