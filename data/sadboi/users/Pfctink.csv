Another thing, binds being better than 240 is subjective, it's all personal preference. Me personally, I prefer 240, but a lot of pro players play with binds. It's good to experiment with both and see what you like and dislike about each system and pull the best from both in a hybrid system, where you use binds in certain situations where 240 fails for you, but you use 240 for other situations."

I explained the situation and he simply told me that he didn't know enough about Reddit to do anything about it.

In this current post, I blocked out the identifying information (as one should) to prevent anymore issues.

Though I only posted that the person could easily be found by the limited information that was given. (hence ""that didn't take long to find him.""), so my expectations were to see OP's post get removed. *it didn't*, but mine got me banned.

I put the first edit to say what my thoughts were about the original situation with the guy.

The second edit was after I had been banned. The only reason why I assume that the moderator who banned me might have done it due to me being trans is because they didn't remove the original post, which is still up at the time of writing this."
