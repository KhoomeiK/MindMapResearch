BPD,fqymhpl,t3_gl6xfh,1589750995.0,"Addictive personality is a wild thing.

I think because we have shallow sense of self that we get addicted to things so easily and so heavily, we literally become obsessed with them. We identify with them in a sense.

It's also getting obsessed with someone to fill the place of the person we feel abandoned by. For example, I'd get obsessed with a girl and project my perceived abandonment from my mother onto her. I'd portray a perfect image because I felt like expressing myself is unacceptable because I am unlovable, then I'd get so nervous that when she found out the real me she would leave me or I would become so emotionally numb I would leave.

It's important to ask why these things happen; the first step to healing is intellectually understanding, then we feel these emotions. Allow them to come up. There are no good or bad emotions, they are just information. Feeling is healing.‚ô•Ô∏è"

In other words, though he may seem like a monster on the outside, there's a reason behind why he did what he did, he is not purely evil, nobody is. People will ALWAYS do what they think is best, even if it's the worst thing they could do. I'm not saying sympathize and stay around because thats not my decision, but it would definitely help to try to understand why he would do what he did. For example, if it's a rape it's probably because he felt powerless, and resistance is overcompensation so he did something to make him feel ""powerful"" even though it's totally motivated by powerlessness. Understanding does not mean agreeing

Depending on how serious these charges are, I would tell Steve the truth, tell him what's on your mind. People can sense authenticity and if he's known you for 8 years he'll probably know if you're fabricating it or not.

It sounds like you've been through hell, yet you're still here. That shows resilience; often when we're being strong we feel weak.

When anxiety, depression and negative thoughts keep coming in, do not resist them. Counter intuitive, I know. But that's what makes this so effective. Our first instinct is to look away, to find or do something to distract ourselves, so we go on our phone, watch TV, we work, we drink, we do drugs, we indulge in sex, etc. But when this negative thinking comes in, sit with it. Do nothing else but sit with it. Allow those negative and toxic thoughts come in. It will be uncomfortable at first, but you will feel more comfortable as time goes on. You are not the voice in your head, but the presence behind kt

This is what I mean by you're not the voice in your head, but rather the presence behind it: Personify the voice in your head, pretend it's sitting int the couch next to you and you guys are watching a movie. A scene of someone who reminds the voice of an ex comes on and they get emotional and visibly upset. Then the scene changes and they start laughing because they find the scene funny. Would you trust this person, nevermind take everything they say with full conviction? Probably not. The voice in your head makes a big deal out of nothing, it's always trying to rationalize. Observe it when it speaks. As you observe, you will notice this ""silent voice"" behind it, its like a feeling but not an emotion. You just know whats right, or what truly feels the most right to you.

Sit alone with your mind, self control is huge. This will help you adopt a more accepting and understanding mindset. Make sure you're understanding with yourself, humans will always do what they think is best at the time.

And for PTSD, start seeing a therapist. That's extremely difficult to treat without it. If you can't afford it, there are psychadellic therapy trials going on for people with PTSD and other mental illnesses. The research has shown that shrooms, MDMA and LSD have theraputic benefits. There was an experiment where they did guided therapy with veterans with PTSD after taking shrooms, and I think it was 5-10 weeks later 80% of them no longer met the criteria for PTSD. I know you may be skeptical, I don't blame you, but do some research before saying no. It might just change your life for the better."
BPD,fpd5gnr,t3_gcp3jp,1588520235.0,"Its really easy to get lost in social media, seeing other people with their friends doing all of these seemingly exciting things. You feel left out, lonely, and probably abandoned (because as people with BPD that's kind of our trademark). 

It's good that you recognize that it's only people posting their highlights. Even better, the pictures they post 99% of the time arent as great as they seem, it's made to portray perfection and we idealize it as being perfect in our minds because all we see is this one snippet where people really try to look like their life is perfect. But chances are if someone is really trying to make their life look perfect, there's alot going on that nobody else can see. Resistance is overcompensation.

Work on getting to the core of your abandonment issues. Do you push people away from you because you feel they will abandon you, so you take that power into your hands first before they get the chance to because you feel like that's the only thing you can control? Why? What caused that fear? How can you stop that behavior pattern? Dig into yourself deeply, it'll help with that shallow sense of self as well. With friends, the only way to get past that fear of abandonment is through it. Face it when you feel it in social situations. Be mindful of your madness, it's okay to fear being abandoned. You can't control that. However, one thing you can always control is how you react. Sane insanity is key. It's not easy but it's a way to change your life. 

I got into meditation and that helps. Sitting with your thoughts that make you uncomfortable can help tremendously if you're consistent with it. Your thoughts will be toxic, you will feel alot of resistance, but the longer you sit with that uncomfortable feeling the better you will feel. You got this. You can do this.

So the question was raised; is this narccicism? 

It depends on the motivation behind why you're doing something. For example if somebody is asking you to do something for them and you say no, it's not narccisistic neccessarily. You SHOULD be selfish, the best relationship we can have is with ourselves. But at the same time if you're saying no to somebody just to have power over them, then you go around talking about self love, then I would say this is narccisistic. 

Everybody is a narcissist in their own way, and everyone has their own toxic traits. And you mentioned how you might have upset people on Instagram? Don't worry about making everybody happy. Because if you're so busy trying to make everybody else happy, you're not gonna be happy because you're going to be a people pleaser, and people pleasers act inauthentically because they think the true version of themselves is unacceptable.

So how do you not be a narcissist? There's no clear cut answer, but what's worked for me is to look at others with a very understanding point of view; ask yourself why? Why did this person do this to me? How must've they felt? Why might they have felt that way? Then notice how you react. Why am I reacting this way? Why am I upset? What insecurity of mine did this person hit?

Lastly, control the only thing you can control, and that's how you react. You only feel helpless and hopeless when you try to control things you can't.

If so, sit down and explain to them that sometimes even after something is resolved you still fear abandonment. Communicate with the people around you.

Also, accept these feelings as they come in. Resistance makes stronger, and resisting the way you feel will only make it worse. Delve into those experiences that you can't let go of, explore them, understand them and why they ended up the way they did. Don't sugar coat it, but don't be too hard on yourself. Be real.

socialskills,fldi398,t3_fo1i31,1585064970.0,"If you're not noticing person to person connection with people, here's a few things that can really help.

ASK THEM QUESTIONS AND SHOW EMPATHY WHEN THEY ANSWER. For example, if someone looks distressed, just say to them ""long day?"" And they'll probably tell you all about it. If they just say ""yeah"", respond with ""so tell me about your day"". People want to feel HEARD. If listen to understand, not to react. If they talk about how nothing has been going their way, respond with ""That seems so frustrating"" and they'll probably respond by saying ""It is!"" In an animated tone because you are showing you understand them. If you do 20% of the talking and they do 80%, they'll probably really start to like you. This works in attraction psychology as well, as it makes you seem mysterious.

OPEN UP FIRST. Some people are scared to be vunerable. I think most people are to an extent. You may be scared to be vunerable as well, but if you're scared, it probably means you should do it. Liberation is on the other side of fear. So if there's just awkward surface small talk, tell them about something that happened in the past week. It doesn't have to be a full explanation, you could just say ""Yeah, this week has been tough"" or ""The past few days have been pretty good"". They might ask why, or if they don't, say ""what about you?"" Vunerability requires strength, and if someone sees you being vunerable first in a conversation, chances are they will follow."

The best growth for me was/is being alone. It's going to suck at first, you're going to be bored out of your mind alot of the time. But what helps is meditation, every day I spend 10-20 minutes just laying down and sitting with my thoughts. Allow your mind to roam, there's going to be toxic thoughts and that's okay. Everybody has toxic parts of them, and if we don't confront them they will come out in other areas of our lives as destructive for ourselves and often for others. You will be uncomfortable at first, that's totally normal. But the longer you sit with yourself and your thoughts, the more comfortable with yourself and your thoughts you will become. 

If writing is your passion, then awesome. Write daily, do what sets you on fire from the inside out. For me that's psychology helping others. Do what fulfills you like nothing else can. If you don't have that yet, then that's okay too. It will reveal itself the more you sit with yourself.

Be okay with failure. I can't even begin to tell you how many times I've had to fail to get to where I am, and I definitely am still not where I want to be.

What I mean by that is don't beat up on yourself and tell yourself you're worthless or not good enough and that you're weak for having thoughts or impulses that you have.

Death is an inevitable part of life. Life and death are 2 sides of the same coin. So many of us fear life so much more than death, ironically. We fear the hurt, the pain, and the feeling of failure than can come with living. Often it's when we face death that we realize how much we let our fear hold us back and that we overlooked the true meaning of life that we desire. Death is the greatest motivator there is, it can liberate us from our fears. We can realize that everything we feared stems from projection and displacement of others insecurities onto us. All negative emotion stems from fear.

Understand why you over share. Does it come from a shallow sense of self looking into people's reactions to see who we might really be? External validation is an addiction just like drugs or alcohol, we have to be mindful of it though.

Meditation really helps, it gives me time to intellectualize and just be with myself, it can be uncomfortable at first but we have to push through that period with ourselves.

The going numb is a defense mechanism that is used probably due to abandonment issues; I know my abandonment issues pop up in my head whenever I care about someone and suspect they might hurt me.

Also, I know you said you are feeling a little better now knowing this is normal for those of us with BPD. But I want you to know something that really helped me: realize that there's a reason behind every emotion you feel. Your mind is gravitating towards that emotion for a reason. Never feel that what you're feeling is invalid, because it is, in fact, valid. If it were invalid, you wouldn't be feeling it.

So sit with the emotion (or the numbness) and it will be uncomfortable at first, but you will get more comfortable as time goes on. Our thoughts will be toxic, but sitting with them is key. Get comfortable being uncomfortable.

I hope this helps, best of luck ‚úä"
BPD,farb0fc,t3_eaea34,1576314121.0,"I still have this problem. But I've figured out a couple of ways to get past this.

Remind yourself that what can be is not what is. There are so many different possibilities, and the chances of me being right are pretty slim. It's just a fragment of my imagination.

Distract yourself. Go for a walk, watch TV, listen to music, exercise, meditate, etc. I don't really like to distract myself alot of the time because I like to face an understand my emotions, but sometimes nothing you do will help. You can't out think overthinking, so get up and do something. You'll probably feel better after.

Hope this helps."
BPD,faixla5,t1_faiaspa,1576119047.0,"The problem lies in trying to make everything better. It's desperation, because by you ""messing up"" that what you last said, it reinforces a belief that we are stupid, not good enough, unlovable, annoying, whatever it may be. And it's painful to feel that. But life changes when you do a small, but courageous thing: use it as a lesson, understand it, and move forward. I recently started to acquire this skill. If you mess up when speaking, understand where it came from and why you said it, accept that part of yourself it came from, and look on how to improve next time. It takes practice, but it really helps.

Radical acceptance and consistency are key. Life is too short to stress about what you said previously that you didn't like. We all have things that make us cringe, we've all said things and thought to ourselves ""FUCK why did I just say that?"" The only way out is to accept, understand and move forward.

Every loss is a step closer to victory."
BPD,faggeo8,t3_e9045j,1576053494.0,"Yes, it's very possible. Growing up I always had shallow relationships, I always mirrored personalities because I didn't know who I was. I would tear apart every relationship because of my shallow sense of self and I would identify with my partner, so when I would lose them I would lose myself too. Sometimes my thoughts don't even feel like my own.

But take the time to get to know yourself. Intellectualize for a couple hours wkthis weekend. Meditate daily for 10-20 minutes and just let your mind roam. It wi gravitate to certain things, your job is to understand why your mind is gravitating towards those things. There's a message whenever the mind gravitates, it's up to you to find it. Sit with the thoughts, they will be toxic. Yet, we still have to give them the attention the deserve. We have to understand and accept them. It wi be uncomfortable at first, but the longer we sit with them the more comfortable we will be. And I mean really look at yourself from a realistic standpoint. Don't sugar coat things, but also dont be too hard on yourself. It's all about finding the middle road. A key to living with BPD is self control and choosing the middle road, because we have addictive personalities and an all or nothing mentality.

As you're learning about yourself, you will notice different passions. For me, I never understood how people think, so now I want to be a therapist. We can be great therapists and psychologists due to our empathy. It's a way of using your wounds to your advantage. Maybe you'll end up following the same path, maybe you'll be a business person, just know that choosing something you're truly passionate about is the best way you're going to be truly happy and living a fulfilled life. 

Love the process of failure in self growth. Check out school of life, infinite Waters and other videos along the lines of self improvement on YouTube. Use your resources to your advantage.

Take notes of thoughts that you have on your notepad on your phone. If you have a thought you think is useful, write it down. If you notice a tendency you want to break that you have, write it down and address it.

You can meditate. Throw on a bineural beat on YouTube with some headphones and just lay down and inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth. You can choose to let your mind roam to wherever it wants, it will gravitate towards something for a reason. Understand the thoughts your mind gravitates towards and why it's gravitating there. You're going to find alot of surpressed thoughts, feelings, and emotions/experiences. Your thoughts will be toxic when you meditate, and that's okay. Understand them and accept them. You will be more comfortable the longer you sit with them. Look at them from the presence behind your thoughts. You are not your thoughts or the voice in your head, that's just something we listen to. We are the presence behind them. This is probably the best for trying to get to know yourself, because you're intellectualizing. You could also choose to focus on your breath and the sensations you feel, that's for bringing you to the present moment.

Your mind will always gravitate towards something for a reason. Observe and understand your thoughts, good or bad. Sit with your uncomfortable and toxic thoughts. They will come. Feel them.

Your uncomfortable thoughts will become more comfortable the longer you sit with them. What made you who you are today? What can you do differently now? Consistency is key.

I also have BPD so it's easy for me to get addicted to things because it gives me something to identify with (since I struggle with a strong sense of self). 

Ask yourself, was it your upbringing that had an effect on you? Do you have a shallow self concept so this is what you identify with? Are you doing it to distract yourself from you? Is it all of these things, or more?

I want you to know that helping people and feeling good is not selfish, it's human. It's fulfilling when you know you actually helped someone.

Anger is an emotion that is desperate hopefullness mixed with rage. We are SO hopeful that the world will be a different way, the way we would like it to be. Our mistake is that we are TOO hopeful. The way around this is radical acceptance and understanding. Look to understand why people do certain things; you don't have to condone it or love it, but look to understand it.

Quit any addictions you have. Whether it's nicotine, weed, or any other drugs, a person, or even thought patterns. In order to grow, you must go without. Stoicism can really help with BPD, study up on the stoic philosophy and see what you think of it.

mentalillness,f75cavu,t1_f73krjo,1573413719.0,"Agreed. And if he doesn't change, or he tries to flip this back on you somehow, leave him. That's not a healthy behavior to deal with, it's manipulative."
BPD,f71gn1y,t1_f71bl27,1573341432.0,"We are addicted to the emotional state we were in with the person, not the person themselves. That's the story of every toxic relationship as well. Next time you're with a person, ask yourself: what exactly is this person bringing to the table to benefit me and help me grow as a person? If it's just their attention and them making you feel loved and not so lonely, then that's a personal issue I think almost everyone (if not everyone) with BPD has struggled with, and it's time to walk away and grow ourselves. If they genuinely contribute growth to your life and as a person, THEN it's time to consider something serious with this person. Just food for thought."
mentalillness,f6rkyb1,t3_dsk6dx,1573108055.0,"Get to know yourself better. Even if it's torture at first.

I have BPD, and I have to spend time to myself daily to get to know myself better. For me, I learned how to help others through my own experience. Show yourself understanding and empathy as well as others, there's always a reason why people do things. A great piece of advice I got was ""Everybody's the main character in their own story; people will always do what they think is best, even if it is not."" That made me realize that hurt people hurt, angry people are angry because the world is not as they had hoped; in some odd way, anger is a sign that we want the world to accommodate to the way our mind works, to be a certain way to get rid of our deepest fears. 

Notice what you're insecure about. Where did those insecurities come from? Did your parents do something to have an extremely deep set of insecurities in you (the answer is 99.9% of the time always yes)? Maybe a relationship? Or your friendships as a child? Question everything and give yourself an honest answer. Being honest doesn't mean sugar coating it and making excuses, but it also doesn't mean putting yourself down; have some empathy for yourself. You're doing the best you can with what you know.

Seek out new knowledge, especially on YouTube. My personal favorites are The School of Life and Infinite Waters on YouTube; watching those videos for free were such a blessing. Take advantage of your resources in order to grow.

Last but not least, be honest with your sister about her situation. Don't always try to make her feel better by being positive all the time, but don't put her down with negativity. Make her concerns heard and show you understand, and then perhaps talk with her about where these issues come from. Analyze, dig deep into yourself and your sister.

Best of luck, friend."
mentalillness,f6pphdk,t3_dsewza,1573061462.0,"I think I understand where you're coming from; it seems like you're trying to be portrayed as ""perfect"". After all, Instagram isnt real life, but it involves things that are in real life. Social media is the only place where you can portray yourself as you without any flaws or mistakes. It is, quite honestly, a place where we can overcompensate our imperfections with that absolutely perfect picture. 

I want you to take a week (yes, a week) break from Instagram. Notice how you feel during this time. It's an addiction, let's acknowledge that. Be mindful of your thoughts during this time. Why do you feel the need to be perfect? What's the reason ? Where did it come from? Be obsessed with understanding why you love portraying this perfect image; your mind will naturally breed results, especially if you don't go on Instagram at all for a week. In order to grow, you must go without.

Seek a therapist too. They can help you get you to the bottom of these reasons as well, as they likely were caused by the ever growing feeling that you're not good enough.

Best of luck‚ô•Ô∏è"
BPD,f69fbmc,t3_dqlj72,1572741134.0,"Man, this really hits home, especially recently.

But there's going to be different challenges in your life. Different chapters, except you have new tools each chapter to work with. You may forget about some of your older tools, but try to be mindful of them, as they can be of great help.

Embrace all of it. Embrace breaking back down to your core again and again. Embrace all of the pain; it will make you stronger than you ever imagined. Embrace that the greatest relationship you can have is with yourself. Learn to love the struggle, as difficult as it may be. There's going to be times where yes, it sucks. But you have to keep looking for opportunities to grow.

It's just like working out in the gym. You have to break down the muscle in order for it to grow stronger. The same is with the psyche. I know it's hard, it's not supposed to be easy. But learn to love the process, not the result. That's something that those of us with BPD struggle with because we are so focused on external validation because we find it difficult to identify with our own emotions. But it's possible, it will take time though.

Best of luck, friend."
mentalillness,f5zrenu,t3_dpw54s,1572584681.0,"I went through something similar in 7th grade. 

I told the girl who molested me that if I was going to kill myself because she didn't love me (I was in love with her). My parents went through my phone and saw the texts and all I could do was blankly stare back at them when they questioned me about it. My parents didn't know she molested me until 8 years later.

You might feel so negatively about them finding it because it's so embarrassing. You may feel like you let them down, or perhaps you simply don't want their help and you want to do this on your own.

Regardless of what the reason was, all you can do now is accept it and move forward. When your parents question you and if you don't want to talk about it with them, tell them the honest truth: you were going through an extremely difficult time where you felt trapped and the only way out was through death. Embrace this experience, don't resist it because you can't control it. The only thing you can control is how you react. 

See a therapist if these thoughts continue. I know it can be extremely uncomfortable to share these types of deep thoughts with family."
mentalillness,f5zq755,t3_dpsg9e,1572583618.0,"I have BPD as well, and while it may seem hopeless now, it is 100% possible to get into a better mental state. I started working on myself and my BPD about a year ago and I've made progress, MUCH better than where I was a year ago. 

I want to be a therapist after I graduate, and I've developed quite a bit of knowledge due to my experience with mental illness, so don't be afraid to reach out. I get what it's like to have a personality that drives away. It's frustrating.

If you want to try working on this over time together, send me a message:)"

BPD,f5zowgy,t3_dpo2vc,1572582525.0,"This is frustrating, you probably feel powerless and lost. It's an awful feeling, like someone placed a sheet of negative emotions over you and you can't escape.

This is from our abandonment issues and our lacking of self identity/low self worth. Often our fp is someone we identify with because since we lack  that solid identity; we have addictive personalities because of this. Whether it's to people, drugs, alcohol, or even thought patterns. We can identify with almost anything. So when we lose the things we identify with, we feel like we're losing ourselves too. It's a scary experience, but if we use it the right way, it's a perfect opportunity.

Take time to yourself, get to understand yourself. Look up acceptance and commitment therapy, that's what I just started using and it helps me to be more mindful and accepting while also moving forward. We need to find that balance of ""I'm good enough"" while still realizing ""I need to keep moving forward and growing"". If you're not already, start seeing a therapist. There is absolutely no shame in asking for help.

In order to grow, you must go without. Best of luck‚ô•Ô∏è"
BPD,f5vts6t,t3_dp78ns,1572499831.0,"Yes, it definitely comes from lack of self identity. Notice if you think of that person differently based on how they answer. Be mindful of that; I tend to like people more if they say something good about me.

The best thing you can do is to be mindful, spend time alone with no distractions and understand yourself. Think. Think of past traumas, memories, and relive them. Get the novel, not just the essay. Process those emotions; part of the reason we struggle so much is because of unprocessed emotions.

I've noticed all my fantasies have one common denominator: to be admired and well liked by others. Be mindful of what you fantasize about and what you hope for, it really gives you a glimpse into your subconscious motivations"
mentalillness,f5s9b1d,t3_dp2bhj,1572417655.0,"There's been one common theme in every single person I've met, and it's been that in some way, shape, or form, people never feel good enough. That's my big problem is feeling good enough.

You have to realize that yes, a piece of what you said in your note was true: nobody is going to be happy by you trying to make them happy. What to do about this? Focus on making YOU happy. Everybody is the main character to their own story, you can be the writer of your script of you control what you can. At the end of the day, the only thing you can control is how you react to situations. Put your energy towards being happy with yourself and finding inner peace. Peace and happiness come internally, not externally. No matter what you have (money, the girl/guy of your dreams, etc), it will not bring you true inner peace until you are at peace with yourself. 

See a therapist, delve into your issues. There's a reason behind you not feeling good enough, likely some past trauma. Learn to understand yourself. Understanding leads to acceptance, acceptance leads to love of oneself. Best of luck."

mentalillness,f5j93e7,t3_do0agc,1572222922.0,"It's always scary telling people that something is going on with ourselves mentally at first, but in reality everybody has something going on mentally. 

The best way to do it is to sit them down, and convey to them exactly how you're feeling. Anxiety stems from the desperate want to escape the present moment. About half of our anxiety is about the actual situation, the other half is because we're anxious; it's paradoxical. The best way to fight anxiety is to accept it and feel it; resistance makes stronger. 

Good luck, rooting for you."

It seems like a decent amount of the discomfort you're feeling is because everybody is telling you that you should be excited. But like I said, they aren't you and they aren't in your shoes. Not letting other influence the way you feel is half the battle.

Because we have such a shallow identity, we have an addictive personality. Whether that's to drugs, alcohol, people, or thoughts patterns depends on what we surround ourselves with. But it seems like you're identifying with the environments around you. Maybe it's to cope so you don't feel so lost and shallow all the time, it's definitely something to bring up to your therapist.

Best of luck‚ô•Ô∏è"
mentalillness,f4ywy23,t3_dm5dne,1571887446.0,"As someone who used to have intrusive thoughts, I understand your pain and frustration. It feels like it's never going to end, and you can't run from yourself. It's terrifying.

From my perspective, I think that your ""fake memories"" is your never ending need for things to be perfect. You want to see all possible circumstances so badly that in your mind they become somewhat of a fragmented reality. Especially from the way you described it, ""Did I actually do it? I can't really remember what happened so there's a chance that I actually did do it"" really highlights the need for perfection.

One thing that's helped me is to observe your thoughts and to realize you are not the voice in your head (the one you hear while reading this), you are the presence behind it. How so, you may ask? Well, let's personify the voice in your head. Pretend the voice in your head is a man on the couch next to you and you're watching a movie. A scene comes on with a beautiful woman, and he starts getting upset and visibly so and starts talking about how much he misses her. A split second later the scene splits to something humorous happening, and he bursts out in laughter. At this point, you'd probably be looking at this person sideways; the voice in your head is HIGHLY neurotic. Would you take advice from this person? Or better yet, would you believe everything he said with full conviction? Of course not! You are the presence behind your thoughts, the problem is you're just getting sucked into them too much.

Now, visualize this: you're on high ground and there's a war going on beneath you. You're watching it play out, just observing, not disturbed. This is what it's like to observe your thoughts and to accept them.

On the flip side, the problem seems to be you're judging your thoughts, probably pretty harshly. The more you resist, the stronger they become. When this happens, you're no longer at high ground safe and undisturbed, youre in the middle of the battlefield with dust and gravel flying in your face.

Acceptance is key. Accept the thought, observe it, and let it pass. It may take awhile for these thoughts to diminish, but they will. Observe, accept, pass on. 

I hope this all makes sense, mention these thoughts to your therapist. Rooting for you‚ô•Ô∏è"

That's coming from within them, they are absolutely 110% in the wrong, you did nothing wrong. Get some therapy and get away from your parents, they sound emotionally abusive.

I also have uncomfortable thoughts that I obsess about. But we obsess with these thoughts because we resist them.

Resistance makes stronger. Acceptance is the key. Sit with your uncomfortable thoughts. It seems impossible at first, but the longer you sit with those thoughts, the more comfortable you become with them. Take time to understand the problem. Empathize with yourself. Understand why it's there.

I try not to leave any corner of my mind unexplored. I think that's important, especially for people with BPD since we have such unstable self images. It really does make a difference."
