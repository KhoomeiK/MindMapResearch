What do u feel about the signs (beside the fact that they surprisingly appeared), do they disturb you, like a feeling that it just needed to clean up cause its dirty? Is it a form u like to watch or have drawn urself someday or du u remember anything when u see them?
Would u mind to take a picture?

I really think that it must be something good to receive such signs, even if they do not have a positive meaning, they may appear to warn or remind u of something and that is always with a good intension.

Sorry for bad spelling or poor grammar, i'm not a native speaker as u might know now:D"
