montreal,fitpu4d,t1_firvw18,1582726624.0,"If you compare to Toronto or Vancouver, yes it is cheaper. The thing is that the average income is also much lower than these two cities. We have a problem of people from other countries coming in for 6 months, paying overpriced rents for their time of stay and when they leave we have to pay the price they paid because landlords won't lower their rents. Thing is it's not possible for most of us to pay these prices with our salaries. I am 30 years old, work in IT for a bank and still cannot manage to have my own place. I have to live with two other roomates to pay the rent.

Don't get me wrong though, I don't think its anyone's fault EXCEPT the Government for not putting enough laws to counter landlords for raising illegally their rents prices.

I'd actually probably be doing the same exact thing if I was from Europe and could be able to work for a while in another country that speaks the same language than me while paying lower rent."
