AskMen,fpl91zh,t1_fpj1yk2,1588708512.0,"This, and if you want easy things, look for stuff you can do in the oven or a grill or crock pot, as opposed to a stove. I love stuff you can do in aluminum foil. I’m a woman and  I used to love cooking and even wanted to be a chef but after majoring in chemistry where I took endless labs, I got tired of measuring stuff out and cooking it and cleaning up. Putting stuff in the oven With foil is less work. Here’s 3 delicious but easy things:

when it’s apricot season, wash them, break them in half, removing the pits. Put the halves in foil with some water and a little brown sugar and bake ~350 for about 10 mins or until they are cooked. Top with canned/real whipped cream. This can also be done on the grill and is a great desert. The apricots don’t even need to be perfectly ripe.

buy some red peppers that are square in shape. Wash and cut in half and remove the seeds and stem and pat dry inside. Lay on a tray on foil and put each pepper half in a foil you can wrap it in. Drop an egg in each half. Bake until egg and pepper are cooked then add cheese on top and cook til melted. This one can also be done on the grill. The square/flat sides help the egg to stay in the pepper shell.

an easy one is to wrap some salmon in foil with teriyaki sauce.

you can also throw veggies in foil  packets with water and steam them in the oven 

Foil= easy clean up
Oven = no babysitting the stove"

A pet peeve there seems to be when women specifically state in their profile that they don’t want to date a  man with kids and the guy ignores it and tries it anyways. Those don’t end well from what I have gathered. I would state from the beginning that you have a child. Saves everyone time and energy and once you put that out there it will exclude women who don’t want to date single dads. I’m not saying there aren’t women who aren’t open to it, just that you need to be up front. I’m older so it wouldn’t be as much an issue for me because the guys kids would probably be grown.

I’m a long time out of medical school, but I don’t recall being taught that vasectomies lead to low testosterone. I’d have to do a literature search though to be sure.

I didn’t know what to think because I was a young female medical student and I thought he knew more than me. He did some damage. One neurologist worked me up for MS/ stroke in a young person. One family doctor told me it was CFS but I didn’t get this diagnosis officially until after about 20 years. Seven years into it a neurologist found thyroid antibodies and diagnosed Hashimoto’s Encephalopathy. I think part of the damaging thing about this illness is that we have no test for it.i hope that will change someday soon.

You shouldn’t let her comments change who you are or what you do with your own body. If you want to build your muscles, you should be able to do so without feeling harassed. It’s sad that many people who become parents don’t understand that they are not raising children but they are raising adults. I hope you can correct this now instead of continue to suppress who you want to be as did I. Maybe the next time she makes a comment that you feel is creepy and invasive, you can say something along the lines of “when you comment on my physique, I feel very uncomfortable “. If she keeps doing it, you rinse and repeat like a broken record. You don’t have to be mean or angry about it, but just keep letting her know that these comments are not helpful."
