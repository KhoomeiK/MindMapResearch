I was in the same boat as you. 22 year old with little to no work experience, trying to get a basic source of income. Didn't know many people and help from the community or government was pitiful or non-existent. 

Just have to keep applying. You will apply for well over 20. I applied for hundreds. Only a small percentage end in an interview. Take advantage of the fact that you are young and therefore, aren't expected to have a long or impressive work history but rather a fire in your belly and a determination to prove your worth.

I got so tired of people acting as though I  can walk into any womens fashion retail store and be handed a job because I am a tall, young,  thin girl. 

We don't live in Disney land, you don't get a job by standing around and batting your eyelashes. Especially in retail. Employers want people with charisma who can sell ice to an Eskimo. Not some delicate wallflower who's too timid to make a recommendation to a customer.

 It's all about the ability to sell, looks are just a bonus. But if you don't have the ability to sell, your looks mean nothing. I got rejected by dozens upon dozens of retail stores because I was introverted."

But I did not write it in a boring, generic way. Using my love of creative writing, I wrote a short poem. It was straight to the point yet playfully written and I ensured it flowed well when said alloud. Rather than covering specific skills, I covered my work ethic which is something relevant and valued by all employers.

I was invited to inyerviews from people saying they we're impressed with my resume even though I had none of the skills or experience that their ads listed as nesessary ."

Unemployed,f5uwmwq,t3_dpct2k,1572480424.0,"Unfortunately you will quickly learn that this is common practice. When they say ""I'll get back to you"" just be polite, acknowledge and express your eagerness to hear back but take it with a grain of salt because they say it to every candidate  before they even decide who's successful and who's unsuccessful. Even if they give you a specific time.

From my experience, employers rarely inform unsuccessful candidates. At the most, they will send  a generic message. Out of the dozens of times I heard the words ""I will get back to you"" only 3 people actually did. 2 were to inform me that I was unsuccessful and  finally the golden 1 to inform me that I was successful.

My respect goes up for an employer for remaining true to their word and taking the time to personally inform me that I was unsuccessful. They probably cop so much anger from rejected candidates but imo they are far more worthy of respect than the ones who lie straight to your face with a big white grin."

Yeah, and all the while we are seen at by the working community as lazy bums who live life as one big holiday and mooch of the government. It couldn't be further from the truth.

mentalhealth,f4p4hnr,t3_dkxsh8,1571715775.0,"I think I am fairly easy to read in terms of basic moods so unless I am a complete stranger, people generally pick up on my mood without me having to mention anything.

I think the difficulty is reading me in regards to how I feel about other people. I have been told I am difficult to read in regards to gauging whether I am annoyed, repulsed, attracted or comfortable around someone. 

I find it very difficult to say "" you make me uncomfortable"" or ""I think you're attractive"" because it ruins that comfortable level of distance that I like to maintain with people. If I tell someone I don't like something they are doing, I am worried they'll never want to talk to me again and If I tell someone that I like something they are doing, I am worried they'll never leave me alone."

Once my dad left, all authority left with him and my sister: the socialite, as you could imagine, went off the rails. Did drugs, stole, partied, banged a bunch of dudes. Now me, who was a socially awkward weirdo that nobody liked, had nothing to do with the new freedom since I had nowhere to go and no one to see anyway. Instead I just became so distant and averse to intamicy that even once I got a life, some social skills and began attracting men, nothing happened because I would nope out and create distance anytime any man showed any sign of being attracted to me. I wouldn't say I am asexual, but I don't get fulfilment from being close to people. I just feel weird and trapped."
