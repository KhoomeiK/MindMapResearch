Gen x people grew up in a time where racism was acknowledged, woman's rights were acknowledged, they grew up in a time where social respect and diversity wasn't very big and just started to kick off. I was talking to my friend about how most homophobic people tend to be elderly, because they grew up in a time where they didn't know how to respect people and the only thing they know how to respect are christian morals.

If you ask someone why they hate something I'm sure they'd have their reasoning, valid or not. Like you said, I'm not surprised elderly gay men might be woman hating. tOnS of gay gen x gay men grew up hating LGBT and marrying a woman, because they were so delusional and thought it was the right christian thing to do.

So basically, woman hating gay men they don't know how to respect and it's the opposite of what LGBT stands for. LGBT does not promote any hate, but you're acting as if this is a generally large and common problem to society, which is not. And LGBT does NOT promote this behaviour."

rant,fqpvd3e,t3_gk70oz,1589554660.0,"Gay guy here.

I've had countless homophobic experiences in my life, everything from verbal to physical. I think me, and a lot of other gay people often make heterophobic jokes. I remember when my and my friend would hang out we'd see a straight couple and jokingly say ""ew a straight couple"" to ourselves. I think the reason me and my friend to this, is to mock the homophobic experiences we've had. Straight couples can feel confident holding hands in public, they can kiss and show public affection without having to worry about ""dOiNg It In FrOnT oF KaReN's kIdS"". Think of these as a coping mechanism, we're not generally hetrophobic or have anything against heterosexual people, obviously without heterosexual people there would be no gay people. Although, heterophobia is nowhere near as big of a problem as homophobia, so many of us don't see much harm in making heterosexual jokes.

Many people, like me, say these things in a joking matter. I think you can confuse jokes and mocking for general hate. Just like how someone might make a gay joke, but it doesn't give me me right to call them out for homophobia unless their intention was to generally spread hate.

I think often times people like to think LGBT is ""hetrophobic"" and just want the world to themselves. Don't get me wrong, there are a very small portion of uneducated people that may be heterophobic, but most of LGBT is not like that. We support everyone for who they are, not what society wants them to be. We understand sexuaity isn't a choice so there's no logical reason to hate on someone's sexual preference.

Awareness of heterophobia can be a good thing for LGBT too, because now you know how much gay jokes can hurt people. (Not saying you should be heterophobic obviously.)

So yeah basically don't confuse and take jokes as hate, LGBT doesn't hate straight people nor is against it, homophobia hurts just like heterophobia."

Honestly no one even asked for UGC. I mean yeah it's cool and all but I'd prefer it if Roblox still focused on events and limiteds. Yes, Roblox will let UGC creators make accessories limited. I predict at the start creators are going to feel entitled and superior so they'll release limiteds for fun and clout, but they'll eventually realise they'll make no profit off it so they'll stop making limiteds. 

Today, the trading community's just filled with scammers feeding off the inexperienced traders. Traders have one goal: to upgrade. No matter how cool a limited item is, now all people do is try profit. The trading community is filled with desperate people wanting to make some Robux and get rich, because its extremely hard to do so nowadays on Roblox. Especially   
 because of the huge population, there's only so much Robux that goes around. Most of it get's feeded to the Robux making machine front page giants like Jailbreak and Welcome to Bloxburg anyway. There are thousands of new developers with underrated games that are finding it extremely hard for their recognition to start out.  

I remember I'd stay up passed 3:00 AM on a school night to be the first to hopefully get a new limited. Worked a few times and was honestly the best feeling of my life because of the income I made. This is what got my into trading in the first place. Now it's extremely hard to start out trading. Tried a couple times, you won't get very far.
