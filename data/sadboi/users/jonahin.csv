iamverysmart,fp5a48z,t1_fnuxtng,1588321691.0,"This is a great opportunity for me to rant about this, so let me enlighten you:

An INTJ is one of 16 personality types according to MBTI. Now, when you go further down the rabbit hole like I did when I was a teenager, you'll end up reading about Jungian Typology. This whole ""theory"" is predicated on the idea that the human mind uses 8 different cognitive functions to take in and understand what is happening around them. Your type is the result of which of those functions you use the most.
When I was 15 and stupid I would argue that this is a theory to understand how people perceive the world and I jumped onto it very readily because the behaviour of other people confuses me a lot of the time and it allowed me to put people into 16 different and neat little boxes, but now, with the most basic understanding of how science works (and I do mean most basic, I'm not an expert on anything by any stretch of the word) I can see that this whole theory is a bunch of pseudoscientific horseshit.

In theory, even if you take away the fact that it's basically worthless, it's *supposed* to only tell you how your brain perceives the world, and doesn't necessarily tell you anything about who you are as a person or where your interests lie. In reality, these different types become something you integrate into your own sense of self. That's why, when you visit /r/intj, it feels like you're reading the same thing over and over and over again. A lot of these people think rationality is a personality trait and not a process you can get better at. Their lines of argument are laughably stupid (""I am an INTJ and I use Extroverted Thinking as my second function paired with dominant Introverted Intuition, therefore I am correct, and if you disagree with me it's because of xyz and not because I could actually be wrong""). They're perpetually more rational because of their personality type, the irony of all that of course being that that's an irrational line of thinking. If they actually gave a shit about being correct they would stop using this 'theory' as a way to feel superior and smart and smug, but alas, they don't."

Not having any access to medical treatment to help alleviate your dysphoria sucks even more. Getting openly ridiculed for being transgender must be incredibly painful.

She gets asshole points if she sent not only the texts, but the nudes themselves.
She could have gone about this more maturely, but I'm not sure how much I can fault her for her reaction. I don't ever impulsively act on my emotions, but that's because I'm really good at suppressing them, and that's not productive or normal either and that's why I can't really say whether this was an understandable response or not.

The next part is the reaction from the rest of her family. That, I think, was pretty extreme. Again, I've never been cheated on, much less been cheated on by my hypothetical boyfriend with my hypothetical sister, but straight-up disowning her seems really, really extreme. As a parent, isn't there supposed to be some sort of ""buffer"" that makes you want to make sure your daughter is going to survive you kicking them out? If she has a place to stay and prospects for future jobs and some kind of safety net she can rely on (even if it's staying with friends until she has secured a new job) the asshole factor decreases substantially.

Furthermore, she's 19. She's not a child anymore, and *should* be able to foresee consequences, but that (a) depends on her intelligence and maturity level and (b) I don't think ""my whole entire-ass family is going to disown me if I hook up with my sister's boyfriend and I might end up on the street"" entered into her decision-making process. It feels like there was no moderation to how the adults handled this situation.

The problem is that she got caught in a lie and tried to flip the script on you so she could be the victim instead.

I really don't know what it's like to break it off with someone who you've spent five years of your life with like that, so I can only imagine and I'm sorry that this happened to you.

You're definitely not the asshole, and her friends could very well be biased. I've read she has conveyed the situation realistically, but depending on how much they care about staying friends with her and how much/how little they care about being morally correct, they might still side with her."

That took a sharp turn when I got older, so as hard it sounds, I think them splitting up when I was younger was preferable.

I don't think both him and June are intellectual heavyweights, but I also wouldn't call June a grifter. I think she genuinely believes what she's saying, and I think she fell for alt-right talking points because she isn't that great at critically dissecting these things (which is bad, because she should be much better at this since talking politics is her career at this point).
She also explained why she now knows that calling black people gorillas is racist in her convo with Vaush. I think she even prefaced it with ""I know this is bad, but this is what I believed"". She took the comment ""Leslie Jones looks like a gorilla"" at face value and explained she thought that wasn't racist because people resemble animals sometimes, regardless of skin colour. Claudia Brown sat her down and thoroughly explained it to her, and afterwards she changed her opinion and admitted fault.
I also think her laughing isn't necessarily an indicator she was genuinely bemused. People laugh out of nervousness all the time. I can't read her mind and know this for a fact, but that's how I interpreted it.

I feel like he relies more on his rethorial abilities now instead of actual research and conviniently forgets that winning a debate doesn't necessarily determine whether you're right or wrong. It's certainly not helped by the fact that he is a really, really talented debater and very intelligent. 

I mean, he actually read Lauren Southern's entire fucking book and did tons of research before he ""debated"" her (I say ""debated"" because Lauren Southern wasn't equipped to have a debate by any stretch of the word) and now when it comes to left-wing politics? He relies on what he thinks leftism is, what he thinks communism leads to, and if he finds even the tiniest of inconsistencies it proves the entire ideological framework of the person he is debating with wrong because it confirms to him that he was right all along and that lefties are stupid bad-faith actors that don't deserve further attention or consideration. The fact that he refuses to talk to Richard D. Wolff makes me think I'm correct on this. I feel like the debate between Destiny and Vaush could have a pretty huge impact on Destiny's community I think (at least those parts of his community that don't think he's an absolute genius who is always right). Provided Vaush does a good job, of course.

Oh, and I'm not even sure if I'm further left than socdem because I want to read *The Theory*™ before I decide on that, but Destiny managed to very effectively make me feel unwelcome in his community and it's so much more reactionary now than it was a year ago, it's fucking nuts. Like holy shit man. Vaush is literally pro violent revolution which I feel very uneasy about, but I feel more welcome and ""safe"" in this community than I do in Destiny's."

Just like her, one of those weaknesses is to understand other people. I would suggest she looks up theory of mind as a point of reference and while she might not ""get"" it, recognizing that her getting other people isn't something she is particularly good at could be something she just lacks natural talent for. Understanding it in theory is the first step. Evidently, there are people out there who are great at reading other people and do have the natural talent for it. So they're inherently good at something she isn't good at. Human beings as a species are incredibly diverse, and because of that talents are diversely distributed as well. There's always some baseline because we are all human beings and procreate all the time, but beyond that there are many, many things that make us as individuals unique."

One of those cars was an old postal car, so the end of the car was pretty high. It was parked on a field of grass and my friend and I decided jumping down from it again and again was a really good idea. It got a pretty good kick of adrenaline out of it, but one day I felt a ""snap"" in my back. We stopped and I didn't pay any more attention to it. That night I woke up with the most excruciating back pain I have ever felt. I went to a doctor because of it, but he didn't diagnose me with anything serious. He told me to get more exercise or something, but that was it. Now that I think about it, I don't think I have ever mentioned to either my parents or that doctor I had been jumping down from a car multiple times, because I knew deep down how fucking stupid that had been. I still get occasional back pain. I think I should make another appointment."

I was depressed as hell and slowly started coming out to my friends. On one particular day, two friends of mine and I went to a McDonalds. I had asked them to pick me up because of conflict at home (my family knew. They weren't gonna shun me or anything but they didn't accept it for multiple years). I felt like shit and was just glad to get the hell out of the house. The one I'm still friends with is as old as me, but the other one was 18 at the time. She also lives a few hours away from us and stayed with my other friend for a few days. I don't know what the fuck made her think this was okay, but she and my other friend started loudly pressuring me and telling me how I *needed* to come out to my dad and grandma (my dad's mom). In a fucking McDonalds. With zero shame. Like, dude. Shut the fuck up. It felt like they had prepared a goddamn speech. They wouldn't stop. They had pulled a similar stunt to this just a day or so ago where they would call me the name I told I wanted to be called in the future in confidence and they just ... called me that in public, like that's normal. I very much looked like a girl. I can't remember how I reacted, but I felt so betrayed. I'm told I look like I want to go on a murder spree when I'm really angry, so I might've looked at her that way. The next day she went back home and we were supposed to bring her to the train station together, but they conveniently ""forgot"" to pick me up even though my house was on the way. I felt even more betrayed, but it also made it very conveniently easy for me to just stop talking to her altogether. That was the last I've heard of her.

I nearly ended my friendship with the other girl as well but somehow we were able to move past that. Reaaally can't remember how though, but it took some time and was complicated."

I've had days and weeks where I've felt genuinely happy for the first time in literal years. I've had issues with splitting ever since I was 11 or so. It felt like an emotional rollercoaster I couldn't ever leave and was trapped in - without even knowing *what* I was trapped in. The older I got the more aware I became of my problems, but there was fuck-all I could do alone to work on it. The only strategy I had was writing stuff down and trying to 'logically' work through my feelings, and that was the mental health equivalent of putting a band-aid on a headshot wound.

Edit: Getting to know the name of my diagnosis felt also really validating because I'm very prone to questioning my own experiences. I had concluded I might be suffering from black-and-white thinking multiple years ago, but if the person I was trying to explain that to wouldn't 100% agree with me I'd instantly question my own judgement and go from ""I'm really bad at seeing nuance"" to ""I'm actually the greatest at nuance"", which is ironically fitting."

insaneparents,fdup6oj,t1_fdinnec,1578736665.0,"Granted, my knowledge of Christianity is very limited, but I read 2 excerpts about him a few days back. It was two bible passages dumbed down so elementary school children could understand it and it just made me mad. One of them was Jesus giving three servants one coin each and then telling them to take good care of it until his return. When he came back two of those three servants disobeyed his very unambiguous instructions to take care of that one particular coin and instead engaged in (if I remember correctly somewhat questionable) business ventures to increase their wealth. He praised the first two and got angry at the third one even though he was the only one who had done exactly as he was told. 

Like, just fucking tell the servants who are there to fucking *serve* you and obey you what you want instead of this backhanded shit.

The second one concerned Jesus hanging around town and two brothers approaching him. Their father had recently passed away and one of them decided to hoard all the wealth for themselves. So the poor one approached Jesus and wanted him to tell the other one that he should share and the first thing he said was ""Why should I be the one to judge this/right this wrong?"" (Dude, you're Jesus. That's kinda why you're there. You'd be doing a piss-poor job being the saviour sent by God when you refuse to give moral judgements and tell the people following you what is right or wrong. You also don't have a problem doing exactly that every other day of the week.) Then he was like ""hoarding all wealth for yourself is bad"" and told a story about a farmer who had harvested a significant amount of crops one particular year. He thought he would be smart about it and build a bigger shed so his produce didn't go to waste. That evening God spoke to him, and God was having a normal one. ""So you want to hoard that all for yourself? Well, too bad bitch. You're gonna be dead tomorrow. Good luck finding satisfaction with your earnings when you're dead"" 
And like, if that farmer explicitly wanted to hoard all of it for himself and not share it, this reaction would still be stupid, but it'd be congruent with what Christians say is important or whatever. The problem is, that never happened. For all we know, God didn't like him trying to cleverly handle his resources. 

I mean, the first story clearly paints gaining wealth as a positive, but the second states it's *not* fine, actually. According to my (liberal) family members I'm taking these stories too literally, but I don't feel particularly inclined to give some stories from multiple thousands of years ago much leeway. What you're saying and preaching either makes sense or it doesn't. Maybe I just happened upon the two stories that make Jesus seem like an asshole and everything else is fine, but like I said, I really don't know much about Christianity."
