I've cut contact with one of the greatest people in my life, because with my current mental health I was just toxic and unpleasant. Causing him so much distress and negativity.

I'm seeing my therapist tomorrow, and I'm scared of talking to him because the sound of my own voice pisses me off, and my problems all just sound like some moody teenage bullshit.

I'm trying to stay strong, because I know my mum worries a lot. But it's difficult. I was also scared of posting here again because I feel like I'm abusing the kindness of internet strangers.

Life's just confusing and scary tbh"

DigitalArt,f93bc52,t3_e3igyo,1575054655.0,"You can get a lot done with ""cheap"" equipment. I'm just a teenager that does digital art as a hobby, and I use my laptop and a Huion H420. The Huion H420 is quite cheap, and it works well and is small enough to carry with you most places, if you plan on travelling or something.  
When it comes to drawing software, like I said, you can get a lot done with cheap alternatives. I use Medibang Paint Pro (which is free, and works wonders) on my laptop, and it takes a bit of trying and guessing to get everything working the way you want it to.

I use my school laptop (HP ProBook 440 G5) as a smaller and more ""travel"" worthy laptop. It runs Medibang just fine and works for schoolwork as well :)

Drawing with a separate drawing tablet is a bit wonky to begin with, but when you get used to it, it is a lot more freeing and works just as well as drawing directly on a screen. To me, it feels like I get a better view of my art, rather than my hand being in the way and taking up space."
