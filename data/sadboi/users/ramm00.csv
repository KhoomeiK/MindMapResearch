SuicideWatch,fcwfa9t,t3_ej46vg,1578024139.0,"I tried twice. It wasn't easy. I gonna do it in a more effective way this time. There is a stupid habit I do. Every time I am in doubt I watch the time, if it is a pair number it means yes and is it a non pair means no. I been doing that since I was a kid, most of the time works, my favorite number is 22, so when that number appear it means definitely yes. I being through a lot lately, I lost my job, girlfriend, I have a huge debt to the bank and my alcoholism is almost destroyed my body. When I was rehearsal my suicide note I noticed that I did it at 2nd of January at 12:22am in 2020. Too many twos. So I thinking maybe is meant to be this way. maybe my suicide will bring a lesson to somebody or a will to live for another. So I think the universe is telling me to do it. It might be something positive. When you know is the right choice you just do it."

SuicideWatch,fcujw0r,t3_eizc1s,1577982675.0,"I am 34 and I am a nihilist. I don't think there is hope for humanity. I grew up in South America. I lived through terrorism, civil war and hunger. I saw people hanging from bridges when I was 8. I became a drug dealer to survive hunger. I remember I sold drugs to a 10 year old boy. I honestly don't have any social consciousness, gay rights, women rights, social equality, those subjects don't have any affect in me. Humans are disgusting, we are meant to destroy ourselves, is in our nature. My last partner is a writer, so smart and so damaged, she was rape when she was a child but, it's completely over my head, she is an activist, she fights for women rights and environment. Through her I tried to create hope, for humanity, for myself. She left me of course, she said I am a hopeless pessimist. I know I am, but I can't be something else, after all I lived. My father died of cancer year ago. He said he will kill myself if he is putting family through pain. He didn't, he suffered so much, even I couldn't see him in his last days. I am struggling with suicide, I been struggling with this for 15 years, 2 attempts of suicide and a very painful alcoholism. I won't put my family through pain, I just gonna end this soon before it gets worst. I believe in the self right of suicide, I think is the most kind thing you can do, save some resources, save yourself the pain of existing. I truly understand how you feel. I wish I can think differently."

I remember the first time I tried to kill myself I dreamt about a beach cold and full of rocks, I was naked and I was concerned that I stay there forever. I honestly don't think there is more than loneliness. I planning how to kill myself. I am very scared. The thing that gets me the most fear is what if I can't stop the pain? That's my only concern."
SuicideWatch,fctshdf,t3_eiv4g6,1577957165.0,"I live in South America and been a drinker since I was 14, I am 34 now. Killing yourself by alcohol is not gonna work and is extremely painful. I have horrible stomach pain and I often black out when I drink. I tried to kill myself 3 times already, I want to say suicide is never an option but I considering do it tomorrow when my mom leave the house. I am not here to tell you that is hope bc I honestly don't think there is. But must be something that you like and appreciate in this earth. I like music and my friend convinced me that there is no music in the afterlife. That saved me the second time. Must be something."
SuicideWatch,fcts1po,t3_eiues1,1577956525.0,"I heard when you kill yourself you reincarnate in the same person over and over again. There is no escape. We are living our lifes in an endless loop. There is no God or any hope out there. Try to enjoy the ride, there is nothing more than that."
SuicideWatch,fctqkwt,t3_eiuwn1,1577954398.0,"It's not about sex. I am a suicidal myself and I had way too many failed relationships. Today I woke up next to a person I find annoying, we had sex and after I felt disgusted, the worst loneliness is the one you feel next a person. I was about the get married once, i was very promiscuous when I was younger, I always in relationships, all of them failed, I hate myself and I want to die. The problem is not world around you, is the world inside the one is broken. Hope you find the actually hope to keep living. I lost mine."
SuicideWatch,f6ni4r4,t3_drx1tj,1572992012.0,"I don't know how this stage of depression works, I haven't eat in a couple of days. Everytime I try I feel nausea. I haven't got out of bed since the weekend. I was drinking last weekend and I think I wrote my friend, I can't remember, I get blackout really often when I drink. He came to see me but he only stayed 15min. Didn't want to talk to anybody. He is also suicidal but he is getting better. Don't want to even think the effect my suicide will do to him. 
Is Tuesday. I gonna buy the razor blades tonight. Tomorrow morning I will try to find pentobarbital in a vet store. Don't know if is legal to buy it, hope it is. I heard is painless.
I don't know how this stage of depression works. My arms and legs are getting numb all the time since a couple of days, and I am sweating a lot. I feel nausea all the time and my stomach hurts. I don't know if is the lack of food or my body is actually reacting to my desire to kill myself."
SuicideWatch,f6lkiwc,t3_drx1tj,1572950189.0,"I was your age when this started, but in this part of the world we have this culture of ""man up!"" So we really don't talk about suicide. Even my family isn't talking about the time I did try. 
I had so many hopes and dreams when I was your age, I did travel a lot bc of my career, and I date a lot, way too many I think. The result is always the same. Suicide sounds more and more logical, an idea which never really left me"
SuicideWatch,f6lje71,t3_dkfkaq,1572948382.0,"Since I was a kid when I had any doubt or question I look the time. So if it's a pair number is a yes, if it's a non pair number is a no. Lately after I lost my job and my girlfriend left me when I have a suicidal thoughts the clock is always in a pair number. So I guess god is calling me back home, or is the universe who want me."
