Alienation is one big concept and it's often broken down into four types. I'd say in this particular case, since we're not involved in the production of those things, it would probably fit best in the alienation from the work itself, as in, we aren't aware of the people who work on these commonplace things we use and have no idea how they're made. Tough stuff to summarize with no sleep but definitely this. It was our good ol' Marx. I think I may have read something else based on his theory but it was definitely alienation.

Some youtubers with 10m subs don't even make all their videos get to a million views or even half a million views and Dan and Phil do, no matter what they post. That is telling of the character of the creators and how loved they are. I am the first person to agree with the fact that all fandoms are crap and nobody will convince me that the disgusting amount of shipping **didn't** almost screw up their relationship. Imagine people out there writing about you fucking someone. It doesn't matter if it's your lover or whatever, it's bad. I know it because I felt it too, to a smaller extent, no doubt, but I felt it too. And as someone who also goes looking for the devil, I know why it's hard for them not to check that shit out especially because some assholes actually link them the fucking things. I personally was never in for the shipping but because I related to both of them and we're in the same age range (I'm one year younger than Dan). As a fan, I just hope that they're happy and healthy and remain friends forever, as cheesy as that might sound.

This is bringing me a lot of comfort like... I was also like this. I was quiet, I did poorly in school. The difference was that there was never a ""professional evaluation"" (it wasn't a thing at the time, I guess) so nobody ever called me stupid in a professional fashion. I just thought was dumb because my grades were below average and my nfather said I was an idiot, too (does the same with my brother but now my brother knows better despite the ongoing self-esteem issues). It wasn't until my mid-twenties that I realized I was just the product of my upbringing. Better late than never!
Also, no. Not at the moment. I quit that for the time being. Until I get better health insurance I'm not risking it because the cheap shit I have only covers the shittiest possible practitioners.

That's even worse, your case. My brother's teacher didn't say anything bad about my brother so my mom never knew. The teacher would just say he was a very poor student but very quiet and meek (aka the perfect target). I'm glad you had your sister and hope you're doing better now and healing somehow. I'm rooting for you and everyone here (trying to include myself hhh).

I personally won't go anywhere despite how bad it is for me until my brother gets away from this shit as well. My mom can deal with it because she's not a supply and has never been (stuck with him because of religion AND the fact that he would kill her if she left him). Now that he depends on her and has been abandoned by everyone he can't do much. Poor little sad narc with no supplies. :) My brother and I are LC even though we live in the same house, since he can't hurt us, we get away with it even though he throws tantrums. He's in denial but I think he realizes how much we hate him. Since he doesn't have anyone to back him up, he shuts up and throws the 'don't cry when I die' type of comment around but that's it. It's pretty much heaven compared to the alternative lol"

I was also hit in school but not like this. I was slapped once and got my ear tugged at once and that was it. My brother told me that he was hit almost every day and she would laugh when he or other kids started crying after getting abused. She's a fucking psychopath but I can't do anything because I don't have proof.

dpdr,f2ek1yi,t3_dd7l8o,1570197412.0,"Yep. No explanation for it but I relate. I sleep with a sleeping mask and ear plugs for extra sensory shut down. As for the cold, it's not too cold where I'm from but at night temperatures drop so when I have insomnia (happens a lot), I'll go outside in thin clothes just to feel it. Also love the wind and I suspect it's for the same reason. We can actually feel it."

Mobile user, too early in the morning. I meant Kevin but autocorrect decided it was Levony. Who the hell is that?"
tipofmytongue,f2echbc,t1_f2eccd9,1570190914.0,Solved!
tipofmytongue,f2eca3j,t3_dd6e8p,1570190711.0,I'd say the actor was Richard Gere but it could have someone else that looks like him. The movie from what I recall involves some sort of experiment or supernatural thing. The 'message' I got from it was that maybe being invisible wasn't that cool

PCOS,f27ihwm,t1_f25rikb,1570038977.0,"It's not cushings though. It'd be closer to a cyst (lol) and that thing produces hormones, in my case T. My doctor suspected it could be cushing's but I didn't have enough symptoms for it to be that. My symptoms overall from all the things I have are hair loss, facial hair, thick leg hair, hairy arms and irregular periods. That's it. Literally nothing else. From what I was told about the procedure, it does seem like it's fairly safe, but there's a risk of destroying the gland altogether and permanently fucking up the hormone regulation system. Plus, my insurance doesn't cover that since it's not life threatening. It's basically just 'deal with it, chewbacca lol'. Maybe one day I'll have money to get the facial hair removed or something, big sigh. Anyway, thank you for your reply. Hope you're doing well :')"
restofthefuckingowl,f24072s,t1_f23z59j,1569941897.0,Yeah... I guess the 'stop doing that' would imply going cold turkey and experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms. This was on ShittyLifeProTips and I think that's where it fits best.
PCOS,f216r1x,t1_f1xiovu,1569868604.0,"Thanks for replying and for the kind words. I really feel like a weak little shit, but thank you. I try to stay alive so let's count that as a strong thing to do! Right now I really won't look for further help because I'm scared. My plan is to (hopefully) get some sort of job (even if it's shit) and become financially independent and maybe invest in a better health insurance plan. I'm usually up for a laugh and crack jokes all the time. Also laugh a lot (out of nerves and just because I'm laugh-y, idk). Sometimes the three ring shit show of my life just gets to me and I can't help but be dragged into a slump. Feels real bad.
About the tumor. In theory, it can, but since it's a small little shit and the only thing it does is produce T, they won't touch it because the risks aren't worth it. The risks of it becoming a malignant tumor are practically non-existent, so there's that also. Plus, I don't think my current health insurance plan would cover that since it's not a matter of life or death welp."

Vocaloid,f1m9f89,t1_f1m8y5x,1569588329.0,"I get it, fam, no worries. I feel what you mean. 'Honey, V is as much into your ass as Miku is real, so maybe shut tf up and sit down'. Kpop fandoms are hell, honestly. I steer clear of those hellholes. Yeah, I know it's not free. I mean that it's free for us to enjoy. Those creators pay a fuckton for the synthesizers but we get to listen to the songs for free and if that isn't amazing, I don't know what is. Bless them and also bless the people who cover the songs. Vocaloid is blessed, pass it on."

Vocaloid,f1m8m5h,t1_f1hwzoz,1569587676.0,"I also dig some k-pop but yeah, you're completely right. I don't like being that person who bashes on people who follow the trends but it does feel bad, man. It's upsetting, really, that they shit on 'anime songs' (Japanese music) and 'robot songs' (try working the synthesizers then come back and talk shit, asshats) but then go like 'omg kpop babus UWU notice me oppar!'. Some kpop is actually amazing quality music, both sound and lyrics, but other songs are just... well, bubble-gum. I have nothing against that but when you have powerful songs that tell you a story and are actual lyrical masterpieces like 'Senbonzakura', 'Crescent Moon', 'Breathe', 'Tale of Six Trillion Years and One  Night', 'Lynne', 'Reflect', 'Pierrot', 'Shinkai Shoujo' (I could go on and on. I once tried to make a top fave and ended up with over 50 songs of an incomplete list so I gave up oof). The more poppy/ballad songs are so nice too, like 'Yowamushi Monblanc' and 'from y to y' are also so beautiful. 'Shiwa' breaks my goddamn heart in the best possible way. I don't know, there's just something so genuine to these songs' feelings. I think it's the fact that they're written by mostly anonymous people who just want to express their feelings/tell a story/etc.. Sorry for the long reply (and delayed, sleep schedule is fucked and so is life  tmi sorry). Also the funny songs like 'Shiritsubomi' and 'Owata!'... damn, I really love vocaloid so much. The home I can always return to. Therapy: expensive; Vocaloid: free."
Vocaloid,f1m76gv,t1_f1jc5az,1569586464.0,"My mom and bro are cool with me liking vocaloid tbh (my father doesn't know and doesn't need to know). I used to plug my playlist in the car and they enjoyed some of the songs, which was really nice. Sorry about your having to hide it, fam. I know what it's like, to a lesser degree, but still. I didn't really say I liked anime and stuff in school (never painted my nails so that wasn't an issue to me, but yea). Honestly, if they don't like vocaloid's songs, it's their goddamn loss. Some of those songs/lyrics are actual top-notch artistic productions made pretty much for free by gifted artists. Some people just don't have taste and their ignorance doesn't let them appreciate the good stuff."

raisedbynarcissists,f1m20t0,t1_f1m15oz,1569581143.0,"I really needed this. Thank you for understanding. This sub is a blessing, really. We're all in this hell together! 
I guess I never realized this was an issue until now. My bro and I don't call him 'dad' unless we have to talk to him. It's usually 'father' 'that shit' 'him' 'he' or 'that motherfucker'. Welp. The name use doesn't work because my brother got his name :') yeah, sure common practice, but we all know why he got that name. The fucking worst part is my brother getting mistaken for Mexican (which he doesn't mind, tbh) because he's tanned and has a common Hispanic name and that motherfucker being a Trump supporter and hating Mexicans (when he himself has been mistaken for Mexican multiple times lmfao). 
I use purposefully vague language when talking to him to avoid the familiarity of 'dad' (the Portuguese version, same difference) and I'm currently in a LC sort of situation even though we still live in the same house. Too many details to explain. Basically a Deus ex machina of sorts back in 2015 in the form of a massive stroke he had that left him severely crippled (using the word freely because I'm talking about him). Pros: no more physical violence; cons: extra entitlement. I'll take that tbh. Even my brother says he has nightmares where he's suddenly not crippled anymore. Now we can both stay the fuck away from him even though his mere presence in the house is toxic. Feels damn bad, man."
Vocaloid,f1hueod,t1_f1ht5ol,1569501065.0,"It's back to being quite niche as far as I'm aware. Some people still cosplay though! Some of the best creators (imo) are gone or have retired so these days there isn't much new content... There are some relatively recent songs that I really enjoy though. Too exhausted and doped to remember the names but if o remember, I can link you later. Sorry about your being bullied... That shit fucking sucks.

There used to be this website where you could download full albums (not sure if legal... but probably, since back then the concerns with copyrights and stuff weren't as strict as they are these days). Tonight's been a wildly difficult one. Been crying on and off for random reasons. Oof. Sorry for random vent-y comment. Cortana, play Breathe by Gakupo."
