Reading ‚ÄúThe Body Keeps the Score‚Äù has helped immensely.  It really put into perspective some things about the brains activity in response to stressors. 

Meds help, I‚Äôve learned I can consume ANY THC, otherwise positive symptoms of psychosis emerge. I also don‚Äôt drink because that basically leads to uninhibited behavior which isn‚Äôt good. 

Coffee is the only drug in my system and even then I should probably limit myself to four cups a day.
