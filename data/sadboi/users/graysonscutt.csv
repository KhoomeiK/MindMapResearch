depression,es258ns,t3_c2fuf3,1561514235.0,"This happens to me all the time. They say I'm being rude when I'm always tired, or when I just wake up because I haven't had time to put my front on to pretend I'm fine. They tell me to just be happy. My mom is also very juvenile. She cannot hold a friend and she is 43. She literally finds something wrong with everyone she runs into. If someone does something that she wouldn't do or maybe they mess up once like every human does, she talks nonstop about how horrible they are and she will go on and on with all of the middle school jokes she can and will talk so much shit it's unreal. She then started to do that with my girlfriend. She would talk about how much she loved her and then the next month she hated her and wouldn't let her come over. She never actually tells me what she does wrong either. She just makes fun of her till the cows come home. I kid you not she will straight up make fun of her hair or say she smells bad. Then when she's done with her temper tantrum she acts like she is just so amazing. I can't keep going through this emotional roller coaster with her. My girlfriend is the only thing I have left that gives me happiness. Today was the last day of school. I only was able to see her at school because my mom freaked out again. My girlfriend is starting to get really hurt by my moms actions and right now I'm scared that me and her aren't going to work out. I can't go through this without her. I walked her home from school and Im not sure if that will be the last time I see her for the summer. And by school time I'm scared she won't want to be with me anymore. She has been such a huge part of my life for a long time now and all I a sudden she's not. Even if this all blows over there's no guarantee that it won't happen again. This is the biggest thing that is causing me to not want to live anymore, among the other things about my family that I would rather not talk about. I literally can't live like this. I feel like I'm already dead."
