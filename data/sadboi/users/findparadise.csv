I’m 27.

Over my nose and cheeks is quite a sensitive area with redness and some things that I don’t know if they are pimples or anything. My skin tone is olive/tan and this is the only place my skin looks red and pale-ish and weird. It gets really dry and sensitive during winter. Flares up and gets super red with alcohol and heat so I think it’s rosacea. 

I get clusters of blackheads and pimples around my mouth and chin and neck, which isn’t super common but for some reason is happening a lot.

I got a massive blackhead that came out of a mole on the side of my face, and milia around my eyes.

The sensitive part of my skin gets really irritated easily, so at the moment I use Sukin sensitive cleansing gel and moisturising which is super nice and light for my face and doesn’t irritate it- but clearly my skin is congested.

I was looking at the ordinary but cannot for the life of me figure out what I’m supposed to use. What’s good for congestion seems like it would flare up my sensitivity and redness. 

Any help is appreciated x"

I found a new therapist and was actually diagnosed with borderline so that’s put things into a really new perspective and I don’t think medication has proved to be helpful for borderline. 

My doctor thankfully listened to me about lexapro and I went off it about a week ago and finally have some energy back, but I’ve been referred to a psychiatrist so I’ll see what happens. Really don’t want medication though, I don’t think I really need a mood stabiliser, just learning to cope when I hit crisis point. And maybe something to get to sleep"
