They just decided today to officially close , and now they are putting together boxes of food for any employee who wants it (and are offering to drop it off to our homes). They also made sure to give their contact info in case any of us need anything at all. I know  it was hard to make the decision but ultimately didn‚Äôt want any of us to get sick. 

My friend who works at a staffing agency has not had the same experience. She expected to be laid off as she was a newer employee - but they chose instead to lay off their only two employees who had no pto left . My friend is pregnant and very worried about becoming sick , but they aren‚Äôt providing any PPE even though her job requires that they conduct interviews with people .
