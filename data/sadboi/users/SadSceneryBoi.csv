[Omedetou!](#congratulations)

Chemistry's a bitch. Definitely my least favorite class. Good to hear you're doing well in school!

I've only seen Mind Game out of those three you mentioned, but I definitely recommend checking out some of their other stuff! Ani*Kuri 15 is full of really cool shorts from legendary directors like Satoshi Kon, Mamoru Oshii, Makoto Shinkai, and more. In fact, one of the shorts is the last thing Satoshi Kon ever made. 

I'm definitely pretty hyped to get to Tekkon Kinkreet at some point! The art director of that movie also was the art director for Kekkai Sensen, Akira, Dorohedoro, Angel's Egg, and My Neighbor Totoro, and the mangaka is the same as Ping Pong's, so...yeah. Definitely high up there in my PTW.

Btw, have you read any of the Children of the Sea manga? I saw you were reading it on MAL. My only MAL friend to have started reading it in fact, lol. It's pretty damn niche, but pretty damn good.

I've been okay. Been watching a lot of anime in quarantine and reading a decent amount of manga. I recently became a huge fan of Satoshi Mizkukami. He's the mangaka behind stuff like Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer, Spirit Circle, and Sengoku Youko, all of which I adore and highly recommend you check out.

How have you been?"
