BPD,fjkz4x4,t3_fdvc3v,1583436772.0,"Same here. When I have a bad day I think that now I wasted my life and that it’s too late now. But don’t let the negative thoughts deceive you. I’m sure that there is something that you are naturally good at and that’s your purpose in life. I start to study psychology now even tho it’s later than usual. I always wanted to do that. Many of my friends are already married and have family and found their place in life. I don’t. But there’s something positive and that is that I spend many years with studying life itself and I have now a very clear vision of what I want in a partner and what life I wanna have. Maybe starting to bring your life in order later is not really worse than being married to the wrong person or being in stuck in a job that you hate coz you took a bad decision when you were younger. I think everyone made bad decisions in life, in one way or the other. And we all have to deal with regrets. And some people even die at a very young age before they even had the chance to pursue their dreams. I think being grateful for what you have helps to see the good and also being aware of that the only thing we really have is time. You have time! You are still here, and no experience is worthless and there will be something that you learned from it. Maybe you needed to go down this path at that time. You did that for reasons. Be kind to yourself, you couldn’t know it back then, that it’s not the right direction. All that matters is what you learned from it and that you now create the life you want. I’m in the same situation and I’m scared and full of doubts, but I must believe that I can make it. Even tho no one else does. I also believe that you will find your way. What I can tell you from own experience and also from what I’ve seen in my environment is that people with Borderline, mental health issues or difficult childhood often find their place in life much later than people without. Stay strong and believe in yourself!"
BPD,fjkem5z,t1_fi10ceu,1583425506.0,"Sorry for the late reply. It can def take time until you have the right people in your life who understand you or at least make an effort to do that. They are indeed rare. But you will know when you found them. I just mentioned today in my latest posting that I sometimes feel like people’s brains are too slow and lack the capacity to understand how I think and why I feel how I feel. In many cases that must be true coz I have at least a few amazing friends who get it, when I explain it to them. They are more intelligent, open minded and curious than the general population. They think more. Try to look for these traits."
BPD,fjk7nit,t1_fjeobjy,1583421818.0,"Very well explained. I can also see that sometimes people just say something like this because they care. But I think there are more empathic ways to express that than saying “You are too ( whatever)”. I especially dislike when a person says this about something that is just part of me. Like a character trait. For example the trigger for my posting was that the psychiatrist where I get my ADHD meds said to me “ You look good but you are too hectic”, followed by why this character trait would predict that I will fail at being successful at the profession that I wanna learn and build a business. This person has seen me only 3 times for like 15 minutes. And I’m sometimes anxious when I have to talk to a new person, because I have this rejection sensitivity which makes me anxious and too self conscious. But I don’t always have it. It’s worse when I have my period and didn’t sleep the night like at the day I was there. When he said this I was just thinking: “Great and what should I do now? Kill myself and not even trying to make it in life because I’m too hectic and it’s a turn off?” I don’t know how he could make me feel this way when I’m really trying to get my life together. I felt good before talking to him. I felt like he was kicking me when I just try to get on my feet. Being judged like this was really the last thing I needed. I don’t wanna be told I’m too something. I think I’m good exactly as I am and I am talented and people usually like my personality. I don’t wanna let anyone tell me I’m not good enough anymore. It’s hard for me to believe I’m not worthless. But people make it even harder sometimes. May they think whatever they want. It just throws me off my feet for days unfortunately every time it happens. Thanks to everyone here btw! I feel so much better that I’m not the only one feeling this way!❤️"
BPD,fjk5bwa,t1_fjfw533,1583420382.0,"Exactly! I also just wanna punch them. I just say nothing about it because they don’t understand me anyway and unfortunately it’s socially unacceptable to punch them in the face. And when I speak my mind or explain what is rude about their words, then they anyway don’t get how I can be so upset about it. Sometimes I really think their brains are too slow and don’t have the capacity to get it. So I just go home and feel this intense anger for days, feeling like a loser, switching between being super mad at myself for being a failure and at them for being assholes. I really think if I would live in a world where people would think like me or at least understand, life would be so much easier."
BPD,fi0ocsi,t3_f5orgb,1582041435.0,"I know that’s kinda off topic, but.... Would you marry me? ;) Joke aside, I know your struggle. It’s hard to find this one person who is equally obsessed with you like you are with them. I’m a very attractive woman, but guys often don’t feel the same way like I do about them. They usually just want to be free, the fun and the casual thing or they are just not manly enough for me. Tbh I think that the best is to find someone who functions the same way like you."
RoastMe,fhxkgg0,t3_f57usd,1581956401.0,You remind me of a blind mole. Why do you still wear glasses when you are blind?
narcissism,fhnqexx,t1_fhcfrkk,1581730883.0,"Well said. True love is accepting a person as they are, not wanting to change them or save them. Being true to yourself and the other person is love. To take responsibility for your own needs first and not forcing change upon another person. Trying to change someone is just as selfish. If you love someone you remind them on their responsibilities and if they don't do the efforts, then you love yourself enough to not be in a relationship with them. If anything leads to change then it is accepting people as they are and letting them realize themselves that they want to change. It's not always the narcissistic person only who is not acting truly loving."
narcissism,fhnjcjy,t3_egf4o0,1581727544.0,"You ask the wrong question. The question should be: “How to best love myself?”
It is really irrelevant if he is a narcissist or not. 
What matters is if you get your needs met in the relationship. This can be very individual. It doesn’t sound like you are being treated as you want to be treated tho. There is no need to treat a narcissist differently than any other person. They are people, just like everyone else. Even tho they wish they were not.

I don’t think that a relationship with a narcissist is always hopeless and worthless. If they themselves aren’t aware of their narcissism and open about it theres definitely not much hope tho. Also it all depends on what your needs are and what your partner is willing to give. And obviously a lot of your needs are getting ignored in the relationship.

You are asking here, because you would like to improve and change certain aspects of this relationship.
It is important to realize for you that it’s not your job to change or save anyone.
This guy is an adult grown man and you should let him take the responsibility himself to make a change and to show you that he is worth being in a relationship with.

You must decide for yourself, what your values are. For me personally I can tolerate verbal abuse, as I easily get bored and it spices things up, but being ignored for days, as well as not being able to discuss issues openly like adults would be a definitive deal breaker for me. A partner who thinks he can give me the silent treatment is disqualified as a partner. A relationship without honesty, reflection and both people willing to work on it is just doomed to fail.

You say that you think this person deserves to be loved and you believe in not giving up on a person. I definitely believe that it’s worth to make an effort for someone you love, but if they don’t make an effort to meet your needs, they are NOT worth it! That’s one sided and has nothing to do with love.

Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that this guy is a victim of his own narcissism and simply can’t behave in any other way. They are pretty good at playing the victim. Did you ever think about that he might want you to feel exactly how you do now, responsible for HIS feelings and needs and feeling too much pity to ditch him? He doesn’t see any reason to act differently. For him it’s all fine. Because that might be what he’s looking for. Someone who tolerates it.

Look, narcissism is much like a private religion in that the person with the pathological narcissism is god.
To be a good partner it would require that he gives up on this religion and sacrifice his grandiose ego for you. He would have to come to the decision to give you and your feelings importance and meaning. As long as he doesn’t WANT to do that he doesn’t deserve shit in my opinion. He is responsible to listen to you and to care about your feelings and needs. He is responsible to act in a way that doesn’t hurt you. If he doesn’t accept his responsibility in the relationship towards you, he isn’t worth it.
You can’t make him want to do anything. If you want to change him it will just make him feel more resistance towards it. Same when you try to manipulate him with threats.

My advice: If he doesn’t accept his responsibility in the relationship be strong and willing to leave him. You can accept him as a person as he is, but he doesn’t deserve to have a relationship with you. By accepting him as he is, but also loving yourself by not neglecting your own needs you show that you truly understand him and let him be as he is. This is true love. Not playing the savior. This true love sometimes can bring people to change. But it should not be your motivation to change him. Your motivation should be to manifest in life what you truly want and need. You deserve being married happily to the one who deserves you. I hope I could help a bit even tho it might be not the answer you wanted to hear❣️"
ADHD,fhi8yyn,t1_fhhweyr,1581620028.0,How do you wanna know if others here like to discuss that? There are many who obviously like to share experiences like this and their thoughts about it.
ADHD,fhhkdic,t3_f2x4iq,1581606161.0,"Oh god! You caught me in action... or should I say inaction? You describe exactly my life with ADHD. Also this reminds me of a phone call that I have to do, coz I wanna start to study psychology. I already had to do it yesterday and the day before! And I wanted to do it NOW, but that was more than an hour ago, and now that I remembered it, I ended up drinking coffee and reading THIS on the Reddit. Do you guys think I’m gonna make it today? Please believe in me❣️Also I wanna let you all know that no matter how hard it is, keep on trying. I think with ADHD it might take longer until we find our place in life and succeed, but it’s definitely possible. I noticed that most of us with ADHD are really smart and talented fuckers. I must know this because I am really smart! Haha.. 😂 I wanna give all of you a hug and wish that you today succeed in everything you have to do! Keep going❣️💁🏼‍♀️"
keto,fhb8r4s,t3_f1o5w9,1581437196.0,"I had 2 eggs and bacon for breakfast plus a coffee with Mct oil. In the afternoon I ate home made Fat bombs consisting of coconut oil, almond nut butter and vanilla protein powder. I made these the first time now and I must say they are quite delicious as a snack in between. For dinner I will have salmon with a salad. What I wanna improve on: I wanna eat more green vegetables and in order to do this I today decided to buy a smoothie mixer. Can’t eat so much of greens otherwise!🤢Maybe making some disgusting green smoothies will be the solution for that."
BPD,fh2ak9a,t3_f100id,1581243287.0,"I also feel like this the majority of time. I feel like I’m not from this world. People are rarely genuine, the world is a cruel place and I just want to feel loved and safe. And also give my love. So ofc I miss a place that I can call home. A place where I feel understood and whole. I think there is a void inside me that can only be filled up by my partner and if the relationship doesn’t make me feel secure the feeling that I miss home comes up. I think when I die one day, maybe I will be back home and my deceased dog waits for me there. I miss my baby so much."
BPD,fg8drcv,t3_exb7mj,1580616529.0,"Ofc this can happen. I think it happens when you expect your pet to act differently than they do. Like for example I come home and my dog doesn’t come to me to say hello I can feel disappointed, because I thought she would. This can in a Bpd brain lead to thoughts like not being loved by your pet. If you are aware of it, it is the first step to counter act this thought pattern. For me it helps to think of that 1. your pet loves you and no matter what they do, they never do anything for the purpose to upset you. And 2. remind yourself that you are the owner. It is your responsibility to love your pet unconditionally and to give your love to them. Your pet doesn’t have any responsibilities towards you. Their existence is enough reason to always love them,  be patient and loving no matter how they act.
For me there is a rule: Never yell at a pet or worse. Really never! They can do nothing wrong to deserve being treated like that. They are sensitive beings and any abusive behavior, even yelling or watching you act out can effect them severely. I think most people don’t want to cause their pets trauma, but many aren’t aware that their actions have such an effect. So, for those who unfortunately split on their pets, I hope you keep that in mind.
I think my dog is the only one that makes me want to expect nothing and give everything in this world."
BPD,fg64ajx,t3_ewq9if,1580552875.0,"I think this has nothing really to do with loving yourself. It is just a Bpd trait in my opinion. I also think it doesn't have much to do with looks. You can be the most beautiful woman in the world. If you have Bpd you will start to obsess over a guy that you fall in love with or like a lot and be preoccupied with that relationship. I just stopped feeling bad about it. I think if they really like me, they won't be mad at me for being me. Don't be too worried about ruining the friendship, because a real friend likes you for who you are. This mindset works for me much better than trying to please them and to not annoy them. I can understand tho, that being so focussed on a person can also be an annoyance for yourself and hold you back from other important things. So what can you do about it? I highly recommend meditating, because it helps to be more present in the moment and less stuck in your head. Maybe you wanna meditate as preparation for the attention shift. When your mind is clear after the meditating it will be easier! Then write down in a journal what it is that you will focus on now and put your energy into. Make a list with your goals for the day and try to do as much as you can of this. Also it might help you to start a new hobby. I highly recommend dancing as it will also make you feel more attractive and you meet new people. Something creative like painting or learning a language is also a good distraction and doesn't require much to start with it. There are many really good free language Apps, so you can teach yourself. It could be just anything that interests you and that you always wanted to do! I hope I had some inspiration for you and it helps!"
BPD,fg5zi0a,t3_ex0a5n,1580545857.0,"Yes, the feeling of not having been invited sucks. I try to hide the shock about it when one of my close friends tell me about where they have been and how fun it was. I secretly think by myself that our friendship is not as good as I thought and it hurts me a lot. I mean, I would ask them. Why don’t they? My best friend recently was on a trip for one week without that I knew. And usually we always do something like this together. When she told me where she was I felt so much anger, because I would have liked to join her. She then told me that she didn’t tell anyone about it and wanted to make a trip absolutely on her own. Then it was okay for me.
Maybe when friends don’t invite me, it has also to do with that I isolate myself sometimes for a while. So they don’t ask anymore, because I always say ‘no’."
BPD,fg5h61n,t1_fg5eare,1580527355.0,"Oh, I know how it feels to see that others your age have already accomplished something in their life’s. I’m in the same situation and it sucks.

BPD,fg5cxpg,t1_fg54x5z,1580524183.0,"This pretty much. I think the obsession with superficiality is just a way of dealing with the anxiety in interactions with other people. At least for me it is. I honestly wouldn’t know how to deal with them if I wouldn’t feel at least good looking, intelligent and so on. Btw cave goblin made me laugh. That’s really how I feel sometimes. I’m just glad when no one seems to take notice of it!"
BPD,fg579jm,t1_fg568cx,1580520038.0,"Same kinda. I would not want to take the attention away from another person, but I also need at least some of it for myself when I’m at an event. When I can’t get any of that I would want to go home or elsewhere. Sometimes I get headaches and I think it is because of my anxiety of not being welcome, when they don’t shower me with attention. I also seem extroverted, but I’m a very shy person on the inside."
BPD,fg55rjk,t1_fg54gag,1580518959.0,"Thanks❣️This just gives me a little boost for my confidence. It’s ridiculous how such little things have a great effect on me.

BPD,fg4ycu7,t3_ewtls8,1580513875.0,"I don’t like to admit it, but that’s also how I feel. I can’t help, but often am a bit confused when someone else is getting the attention/compliments of others. I think it is because I’m always looking for signs if I’m good enough or not. In my messed up brain, when someone else is getting a compliment it must mean I’m insignificant to the universe. I see the flaw in my thinking and if it is for example my best friend who is getting the positive attention I can genuinely feel happy for her. But I also want the recognition and knowing what is appropriate, doesn’t really help how I feel about it. I think it has to do with a lot of rejection in my past and that I felt invisible. This feeling of being invisible I still carry with me and that’s why being noticed is so important for me.
I also sometimes think I’m better than others, even tho I’m convinced to be the worst. It’s probably an important coping mechanism to deal with the self hatred.
I also have a tendency to think that I must be somehow better than others, because of all the efforts that I make to be perfect. Normal people aren’t so hard on themselves. Also I’d like to think of myself as more empathic and loyal. So the world often seems to me insensitive and uncaring. This somehow makes me feel very special about myself, even tho I see myself as the worst. I’m confident and at the same time insecure."
BPD,fg4oio6,t1_fg4i0jk,1580507612.0,I agree with you. There are more important things in life than taking selfies. I do it once in a while tho and if I do I obsess over my flaws that I see as a proof of not being good enough ever. I don’t know if I could be wise enough to never do it again. Sometimes I think I’m looking for this proof of being unworthy on purpose till I found something.
BPD,fg4b1vi,t1_fg3u8mr,1580499952.0,"I also pay much attention to have the right angle, but sometimes all angles seem to not be okay. I wonder if I can ever fix my fragile self esteem. I wanna feel good enough."

BPD,fg2bf1c,t1_fg28p9g,1580441872.0,"Sometimes assumptions can be right tho. I don't judge, but I'm careful. I have these thoughts on my mind that it could be that way. It could also be something else of course. But intuition should not be dismissed. I also don't think that about everyone that I interact with, but when there is a new person in your life that you have intense contact with every day over like 2 month and all of a sudden they drop from the face of earth. Then this can't be explained with just being busy. This is insensitive at best and ghosting or malicious at worst. It happened to me, so now I wanna be more careful for my own wellbeing. I also know myself and that I have a thing for narcissistic men, who emotionally abuse me. With that in mind being careful is fully justified for me."
BPD,fg289fs,t3_ewfv5m,1580440323.0,"Yes, you’re not alone. It’s the same for me. When someone who is very important for me doesn’t reply I think theres something going on behind my back, they want to control me, humiliate me, make me feel insignificant on purpose or they had an accident. When I become concerned that something could have happened to the person, I used to send them a message to ask if they are okay. Today I think twice if I wanna do this, because I feel like a fool, when I figure out that they were doing fine and just ignored me, because they don’t give a shit about me and how I feel. It made me feel like an idiot. So these days I only send the “Are you okay?” message if it’s family or a person I can really trust."
ADHD,ffz78if,t3_evsqui,1580366148.0,"This happened to me a lot too. I think I can’t count anymore how often I forgot an appointment.

I’m a woman, I have long hair and it’s very expensive always when I go to the salon.

BPD,ffyr7ug,t3_duz4zp,1580353159.0,"The symptoms overlap a lot, which is because the brain structure is similar. People with ADHD are at higher risk to develop personality disorders.

I think symptoms that are more found in Bpd could be a very strong emotional dependency on the partner, an intense fear of abandonment, the idealization and devaluation of people and often a push and pull dynamic in relationships."
BPD,ffxt157,t3_evmpcy,1580331840.0,"This sounds like there is a lack of trust and open communication. I also experience something similar at times in my relationship. I also sometimes remember things my partner did or said in the past and then feel angry about it. In my case when I remember all of a sudden what a “bad” person he is, coz of what he once said or did. It is probably because of a general lack of trust in the relationship. The things from the past make me feel anxious that my partner doesn’t love me. Maybe this is the same in your case and leads to that you tell him that you want to break up. I think you might just need reassurance in that moment that he loves you. Try to communicate openly with your partner about how you feel on the inside. Tell him what you need. He should help you to feel secure, loved and wanted in the relationship, so you don’t have to tell him you wanna break up all the time. You partner will also be more willing to give this when you ask for it instead of doing something that hurts him. Hope that helps!"

You probably feel a lot of cognitive dissonance right now. Don’t find excuses for her behavior. This is abuse!
I’m really sorry you have to go through something like this. She may also have strong narcissistic or sociopathic traits.
Obviously she doesn’t give a shit about how you feel or what she’s doing to your reputation. She might even enjoy humiliating you like this as some sort of punishment.
I think she left her cat and her clothes, because she wants to have a reason to contact you again or because you will have to contact her. It’s very likely a manipulation.
From what you have written, you seem to genuinely love her and treated her well. It’s important for you to understand that it is not your fault and you could have done nothing to prevent it.
Don’t waste your precious energy on trying to understand a person who doesn’t want to give you clarity and refuses to empathize with you.
Even tho we don’t know each other, I’m concerned about you when you say that you might wanna end it.
I thought about suicide a lot of the times and I understand that it can be hard to see the sunlight when your life falls apart. But don’t give up!
You may feel helpless and powerless at the moment. And this is how it feels to be abused by a toxic person. 
My advice: Set a boundary here. Don’t let her back into your life. Focus on yourself. Focus on doing things that are good for you and your healing. Emotionally and physically.
Pick yourself up from the floor. Realize that you are not powerless. Know that you have the strength to overcome life’s issues and that you’re not alone. I’m sure there are people who care about you and those are the ones you should surround yourself with and get support. Write down what you’re grateful for in your life. Exercise. Eat healthy. Self care is the most important whenever you hit rock bottom in life.
