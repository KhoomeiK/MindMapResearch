You can replace trees, you can't, replace history. Surprise surprise! People value history. I don't care if it's a cathedral. History is history. I bet if it was an ancient library or something that was burning you'd definitely have a much different reaction. Here's a groundbreaking idea; you can still be an atheist and care about the preservation of history. Yes even if it is a religious structure."
