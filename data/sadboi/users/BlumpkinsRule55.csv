EatingDisorders,fphb9ng,t3_gd8qdd,1588618207.0,"This is my story exactly right now, to a T. I felt all of these emotions and tendencies coming back and started cutting calories and over exercising. I immediately got a nutrionist last week who is doing daily check ins with me on how I‚Äôm feeling and holding me accountable to only check the scale once a week- as i am still trying to lose a healthy amount of weight too. I think the biggest thing is to realize you don‚Äôt have to do this alone, that‚Äôs a humongous feat to do alone. I wish I would have told myself that years ago, but now I have a therapist and nutrionist and it makes it so much more manageable. If finances are an issue (which there‚Äôs a ton of knowledgeable and affordable people out there) then try to talk to a friend about being your accountability person to do check ins with, it could really help to just have support."

EatingDisorders,fmlf72t,t3_fvo5ug,1586185193.0,"I do not know the science behind this but I know what worked for me. I had to complete let go of counting calories and being crazy about cardio. I completely let go of all of that and started gaining weight. Throughout this I was still really active weight lifting everyday. It was hard to see me gaining weight but mentally I was getting so much better. I eventually started shedding some fat with some cardio but not near the amounts I used to. I have found that weight lifting and putting on some muscle has drastically helped my metabolism and to help me feel really strong and healthy. The body expends more calories with more muscle tone. I‚Äôm a young female and no I‚Äôm not bulky, but I feel the best I‚Äôve ever felt. 

Short summary: let your body rebound on eating whatever it needs, start weight lifting and nourishing your body as needed. 

Wishing you all the best!!"
