Anger,fow76tu,t1_fora6de,1588114279.0,this is such a garbage statement. yes he is still growing and maturing but it doesnt mean he has to wait to learn to cool off doing whatever helps him out instead of lashing out and after that maybe speak to his mom or someone else about his feelings. op you are a human being you are able to harm but it will be for nothing just focus on diffusing your anger and it is easier said than done but it's better to try than to not.

Porn is an option it's there to help and as like everything if you consume too much of it it becomes harmful. The root of the problem is the stigma around women's bodies and sex and it won't help anyone if it isn't talked about. 

There's gotta be better sex education, better consumption education we dont have to turn to see who is more pro porn and if it's just because of feminism we have to sweep clean every nook and cranny from sex and bodies being from being taboo."

SuicideWatch,fdiy7n8,t3_elj38e,1578453760.0,Yhe way you're feeling is valid your dad moved weird by recording you. I can promise you that the importance of how you look to the world matters very little right now and the way you see yourself or want to see yourself as is what matters most. Weight can be lost in a different period of time if it's something you don't want to take care of at this time surely though recognize that the food you eat also helps with how you feel. A partner is never necessary in anyone's life and it shouldn't be a priority but without a doubt a person will come into your life that will push you to do your best. I get stuck in my own thoughts as well and I catch myself when I'm being negative to me or to anyone and truly I have learned that every hour of every day I get wrapped up. It took me some time to stop myself and breathe to feel my diaphragm expand. Meditate every now and then it helps keeping you at bay.
