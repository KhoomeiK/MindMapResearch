AskReddit,fkzjiof,t3_flgaml,1584672490.0,"My wife and I run an in your home pet care and dog walking service. July would be 4 years since we began. 

It hit is hard. We work and live in Colorado so already cost of living is very high. Renting is even worse. I am also a type 1 diabetic who has been dependant on Medicaid since my diagnosis at age 24. (I only use Medicaid assistance, nothing else, I pay obnoxious rent like everyone else and buy my own food).

Already stressing this year about losing my Medicaid because I possibly made $2,000 more than is allowed by Colorado Health First to maintain my ""poor-enough-for-assistance"" status. Which when you add up my blood work, urinalysis, doc appointments, my test strips, my insulin, my pump supplies.... Etc...etc.. equates to... Well I only know rough numbers of my prescriptions, so those alone are $1100/month. 

As the word spread and people began stockpiling weird shit. Our clients slowly began contacting us, cancelling their trips, then the travel ban came and everyone else cancelled for the remainder of March. Watching all the money add up in the cancellation report last week made me want to throw up.

Then this week we've had 1 client who quit her healthcare job because she has a history of respiratory issues and she was too scared to be around so many people feeling more susceptible.

Then another client called my wife crying yesterday saying it would be the last day we would see her dogs (we take them to play 3x a week) because she was let go from her job (unsure of what she does at this moment). 

I always knew I was in a luxury business and we're the first to go when people need to cutback their budget but without some sort of extreme extra assitance during this time, we'll be homeless if we survive it."

SandersForPresident,fjfewcx,t3_fd3z1p,1583290371.0,"I've sent what I could this year. Never donated to a campaign nor* have I cared as much as I do this year.

I am a type 1 diabetic who was injured on the job at the age of 19. No stable work could be found... Workman's comp was an 8 year battle. 8 years of opiates to cover the pain instead of solving the problem. Just to milk the insurance company on my behalf I assume... No one cared.*

Now I have attempted to build my own business with my partner. We are 3 years in and because I have always struggled (since my work injury) I am on Medicaid for my diabetic supplies and maintenance. In Colorado the 1 person income limit is $16,612. My rent has been raised $100/year and I fear it's coming again for a 900 SQ foot house in a.... Meh part of town... For $1350/mo. My half is over half my income, utilities NOT included* My business is successful but does not matter so long as I require Medicaid to afford all of my medications, supplies, appointments, bloodwork etc.

I fear I will end up homeless because if something goes wrong with my car, (even though I have the full ability to fix it myself), can barely afford to buy parts if they're* needed.

I just want a president that cares about me as a citizen... I can't be a productive member of society if I'm sick and poor.

I want to be able to maintain my illness worry free. It's already a 24/7 struggle to maintain a disease that just showed up on my doorstep one day in college, ($12k debt there).

I'm growing mentally, emotionally and physically tired of working just to live to pay taxes to a country who can't even provide me with some affordable healthcare without capping my income. The system is set to keep the sick and poor, sick and poor. I know (I can of course only speak for myself)* a lot of us would rather die than continue this cherade.

I will do my part to spread the word of Bernie, donate when I can and hope that there are enough compassionate people in the country who can open their minds and hearts and realize we don't want something for nothing... Those of us who are sick but capable of working, need to have our health in line before we can run on the same level as others without life compromising ailments. We might be sick but damn it if we can't be helpful we we're feeling good.
