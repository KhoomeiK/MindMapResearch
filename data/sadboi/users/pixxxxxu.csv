Beastars,fm8sp6o,t1_fm80oqd,1585855298.0,"Look I feel kinda bad... (now I can't say that with out sounding insincere, great) I got caught up with fun of just arguing and said things that were just plain rude. I don't however agree with dubbers taking any creative rights that would differ from the original material, no matter how slightly. I do also stand by my own opinion about the Beastars dub having some odd, to say the least, choices for voice actors, but in the end I just went out of my way to be toxic for fun of it. I guess the thing that mostly irritates in the dub culture, is the way it seems to slowly dumb down it's viewers. I don't have any official stats or numbers, but more often than not it's the countries that have everything dubbed to their native language(Japan, France, Spain etc) that are the poorest in English, which in our day and age is a pretty crucial language to have at least a basic grasp of. I learned basic English before I was taught it in school, because I watched cartoon network in English without subtitles (the same channel was broadcasted in most nordic countries I think) Same with Japanese; I'm definitely not fluent, but I could hold basic conversations or do my shopping in a grocery store. Never studied it a day in my life (exclude the hiragana and katakana) Just by watching anime like the disgusting weeb that I am.(nice humble brag section here) I'm not saying people have to learn foreign languages, but I feel like dubbing is a product of pandering to those who are not willing to see even the tiniest bit of effort to enjoy their fiction, and when that pandering has gone on from childhood to adulthood, it has become near impossible to cut of. When I bash dubs, it honestly doesn't come from a place of: ""ugh freaking cretins who can't read, I'm superior to all of you.""
It comes from the physical feeling a cringe, clenching my teeth together having the same expression on my face as someone who downed a shot for the first time in their life. It sounds unfitting and borderline satirical. Why do I and so many have such a strong reaction, I can't say.
So I apologize, and will be a bit more mindful of my comments in future(since the actors are real people with emotions) but that said every person weeb or not does have a right to their opinion. 
[talking of shots, I should read our whole convo and take shot every time with the phrase ""spitting hot air"" lol jk ]"
Beastars,fm7uudb,t1_fm6ko4x,1585837239.0,"I was talking about corporations taking an advantage of you people who ""are too busy admiring the animation"". As in, the market for English dubs wouldn't exist without the needs of those who are simply too lazy to read. Things like dyslexia are unfortunate, but it isn't so common that it would solely explain the need for the dubbing industry. I suppose it's a natural continuation from childhood, watching everything in dubbed and and as you grew up you hung on it like a safety blanket. You know, fearing/hating something new and as frightening as reading subtitles. Sorry about not being clear. English isn't my native language, but hey I'm still doing pretty okay reading subs.
You never considered that if a lot of people complain about a product, there might be something wrong with it? Never gave thought to the possibility that maybe most of English dubs are hastily made and when compared to the original the difference in quality is as clear as day? Thus having the weebs laugh and point out its incompetence. 
It's also kind of funny when previously you told me that I think of my opinions as objective facts. But did you not do the exact same thing? ""ugh no he doesn't sound thirty! What of course Jack sounds caring and like he has other attributes beyond that of an Ed, Edd n Eddy cast reject "" kind of funny of you to call me out but do the exact same thing yourself. 
Oh and that's always a really good argument: ""ugh you just don't know what your talking about!"" So I take it you must then work in the animation industry? Or perhaps with voice actors? I guess it would make sense, since you seem to hold every dub created like it's the newborn reincarnation of baby Jesus that must be protected at all costs and can do no wrong.
And sure let's just agree you are right, if it gives you such solace. This whole exchange brings a quote to mind ""It’s hard to win an argument with a smart person, but it’s damn near impossible to win an argument with a stupid person."""

How will product creators know how improve when they won't get any critique? 
 Funny how the English dubs always end up getting critique, but not the originals...(goes the other way around; some Pixar characters sounding like Dio from Jojo is pretty jarring) it's as if the second adaption would almost always feel a little off or rushed. But wow some weebs must've hurt you real bad since you such a vendetta against them? Did they also bring up the sore spot about industries making a buck from creating non original content for adults who are simply too lazy to read? I can't blame dubbing industry. Corporations have taken advantage of the gullible before and will probably keep on doing so as long as the gullible are plenty.

And yes most of the things are only that opinions. I didn't think it would be necessary to write before every statement that is clearly an opinion ""in my opinion"" cause I kind of assumed you would be able figure that out by yourself. 
Still I stated things that are objective(unless the writer lied about the creation of the anime and about her input in it, which I highly doubt) 
The original voice cast was chosen and directed by the actual makers of the show, not an outside party that only had the original to copy. You cannot deny that the original voice cast thus obviously had the superior direction from the get go. 
Well myself being 25 soon, I don't think my voice will have a dramatic drop in pitch in five years. I don't know what kind of thirty year old people you know, maybe they all work mining coal with no proper respirators, but I know a few who have a far younger and clearer voice than that of our edgy punk Legosi... 
About Jack, like you said it yourself ""he is basically a looney toon"". I don't feel like such a description should fit anything than just that; a silly cartoon character meant for kids. So as this looney toon character will in the following seasons come to some sad/serious stuff(don't know if you've read the manga) it is gonna be quite a jarring experience trying to listen to the outcast cousin of Bugs bunny trying to sound sad or hurt without it sounding and feeling comical and just plain cringy. Also interesting you didn't mention the the previous Haru example, as in the English voice actor portraying different emotions than that of the original; again an example of poor acting or poor directing. Or the directors figuring they can tweak the characters to their liking, beyond their rights when working with material that isn't theirs."
Beastars,fm2kyca,t1_fm2jtm0,1585699603.0,"I suppose the thing that always sticks out to me in any new dub (be it from Japanese to English or the other way around) is that you can almost always feel the lack of input from the original creators...
That, and also the fact I never understood to need to English dubs for animation intended for older audiences(exclude stuff meant for kids)
If you have an impairment, like say dyslexia I can't blame you. I suppose it's what gives most of us weebs that feeling of superiority; to perform a basic human function that is amongst the first to be taught in school: reading.
Why is it that with anime there's this odd need for functional adults to have dubs similar to that meant for children? I don't think anyone is seriously asking dubs for say, the movie Parasite, but if it's anime it's like suddenly people lose their ability to read?"
Beastars,fm2jtm0,t1_fm2ax8m,1585698926.0,"Again most of your points[as much as mine] are opinions.(A little rougher? He sounds freaking 30. And no, Jack doesn't feel like a cliche funny sidekick in the original dub. He sounds like an actual person. Even he didn't get screentime he deserved, the Japanese one sounds far more lifelike and overall likeable. With this actor it's gonna be a train wreck when the more sad/serious scenes with Jack come up) In my opinion the fault isn't with the actors; it's not their fault they were chosen for the wrong roles. Either that or the directors fucked up when directing. The original voice actors were chosen with the help of the author, and with she had some input in most other creative choices. The Japanese voice actors got directions from actual makers of the show. The English ones didn't. Their directors only had the original to try and copy (in which they failed miserable) I'm not saying they have to make an exact replica, but at least pick similar voices and try to convey similar emotions in the given scenes, and not take the directive rights that aren't theirs and decide by themselves how the characters act(your Haru example)"

Legosis original voice actor was a perfect choice; shy, soft and subtle. Perfect contrast to his figure as a feared huge carnivore. If Legosis character was someone like Bill, the edgy ominous sound would fit him better. Oh that subtle growl thing? It was only noticeable when she was right next to his throat, not something you would hear constantly. 
 As for Jack his voice sounds like a joke. Yes Jack was a fun guy, but they took that and made it his only characteristic and exaggerated it all the way; the funny wacky sidekick friend.
