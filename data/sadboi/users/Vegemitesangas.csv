I'm on medication, I do see a psychologist... But neither of those gives me purpose to continue. I too have nothing im looking forward to, I can't imagine anything happening in life that would actually make me happy.
I have hobbies and I have been getting myself to exercise etc, I've recently been eating healthy and losing weight but it doesn't really change much.
Hopefully you have a different experience...

I didn't choose to be born, it's not selfish, I didn't have a say in living and they're religious anyway, they'll have hope.
Annnnd I'm actually seeing a new psych because, yes, the previous one did not help much at all (he is the one that suggested I should go back to the gym etc, which I have done).
You really don't understand how much I've already thought about this and how much I've tried to come up with a solution.
Edit: think about all the poor people with health problems that could benefit from my organs, seems like a win win to me."

Anywayyyy thanks for the vent, I'll see what the psychologist says next time. They haven't really been that useful, but we will see."

I dunno, I don't have to be completely fucked up to be depressed.
Meal prep is not bad at all. I also have been to the doctors plenty etc and my recent blood test results are fine. I spent some time recently gardening etc since it's spring and I've spent a decent amount of time out in the backyard in the sun.
Just last weekend I went out with a bunch of friends and went to a restaurant etc with them.
At least weekly I have a family dinner at my parents and see my 3 young nephews etc.
Despite all of this I have no motivation to live. The thought of going back to work in over a week makes me even more anxious, where does this monotony end?
I even have plenty of money saved to go on a holiday, but have no desire to."

Like anything that I do enjoy to an extent outside of work just isn't worth the rest of the monotony in life tbh. Hard to explain I guess"
