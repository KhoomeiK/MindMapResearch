AskNetsec,fp26lh7,t3_gauj7b,1588256180.0,"You’ll probably want to separate the on-prem vs off-prem (SaaS vs internally hosted) questions. For SaaS it’s really not much different than securing a normal application, you “just” need to identify the controls that are needed and get in the contract who is providing what. Outside of that...   

SaaS: what kind of testing have you undergone and the current status of findings(pen tests, third party audits, etc), DR/BCP, what are your breach notification policies (make sure they have to alert you if your data *may* or is impacted), who from their side has access to our data, do they use our data for any reason (like collecting statistics... grill them about how they anonymize data if so) and make sure to roll your eyes when they take advantage of your data to improve their products for other users. Make sure they notify you of security issues, and inquire about their update policy and customer notifications. Ask about data destruction and if to can extract your data when the contract is complete.  

Then usual stuff like access controls (does their auth work with yours), data encryption, logging/monitoring (can your SIEM get their info), etc.  

For on prem just the usual controls. Make sure it meets your security policy. They shouldn’t need much of your data outside of what is required to integrate the product, provide licensing, and how they access the product if you need support. Ask what data gets sent back to them.  

Edit: oh, and if any of them use terms like “completely secure” or “unbreakable” or “unhackable” make sure to let ‘em have it."
