It’s made me much less ashamed to tell people I’m suffering from suicidal ideations and the resulting shame and guilt from a failed suicide attempt really was the kick up the butt I needed to focus on recovery. It was die or keep living, and since suicide is more difficult than I anticipated, I had to get better. I am blessed, despite all my trauma, to have a family who are willing to have difficult conversations with me when needed and who fully support me, even on dark days.

My suicide attempt however caused deep trauma for my ex-partner and led to the ruin of our relationship. I believed so deeply that they were the love of my life and we would be together forever. But dealing with suicide is difficult - even when you survive it.

Lots of regrets. Lots of opportunities to grow and learn. Some things get better, some things stay shitty but learning coping mechanisms and addressing trauma can make the every day a lot easier to deal with."

I know for a fact I don't show signs of emotional instability. I'm surely more familiar with my current medical ongoings than you.

If you, a medical doctor, is so capable of making inaccurate generalisations of people with mental illness, then do you not think that is harmful in itself?

Mental illness is such an integral yet underfunded part of peoples health. Come on, man. You can't be down for helping people physically but yet set them back so far re: mental health?"

Borderline makes people feel emotions more intensely, and yes, when it isn't under control it can definitely result in hysterical reactions. But it's also possible to have a BPD diagnosis and have control over it. People spend years working to care for their disorder, and can function quite healthily, lest we have a bad mental health day here or there.

 They're not acting hysterical.from choice, or because it's a quirky little personality trait. God forbid someone with an illness show symptoms.

You sound like a real catch, my dude.

Maybe instead of shit talking hysterical girls you could start to consider the fact that these are symptoms of a serious mental disorder, often caused by severe trauma.

I would start off just by trying to be there for your sister. I don't know if you're close or not, but just supporting her in general and letting her know that there is someone she can talk to will be a massive help imo.

I worry if she knows you've snooped in her room, whether it was from a good place or not, that it might upset her.

MandelaEffect,euemour,t3_cfvyed,1563748261.0,I swear there was a Flubber sequel? I remember seeing the VHS casing and everything and remember laughing at how bad it looked even as a kid.
BPD,et7qwkr,t1_et7obf8,1562536213.0,"It's a kinda pessimistic way of approaching it haha, but it was the starting point of cultivating much more healthy coping mechanisms for me.

Like another comment said, sometimes people don't know how to deal with things so play the blissful ignorance card. But no matter what, you gotta have your own back! Keep going. At the very least, you got all of us guys. We're in this together. I believe in you!"
BPD,et5t8o3,t3_ca3kkm,1562488629.0,"I totally relate to this. I've been trying to be more open with people, going as far to explicitly say to them, ""I'm having a really difficult time right now and I feel alone. I could really use some support."" To no avail.

It doesn't make it any easier, but I've been working on trying not to take it to heart. It's pretty difficult. But we can't let our expectations of people harm our own recovery.

I really wanted to self harm the other day, and I too had that thought of ""this'll show 'em!"" And while it's a bit pessimistic, I had to pull up my big girl pants and get real about it. Maybe they won't care about this either? And then I will have only let myself down. Ain't no point in that!

Also, sometimes people do care. It's just we all are pretty wrapped up in ourselves, right? Some days people can't handle emotional conversations, or some people just are bad at reading social situations. there's a whole plethora of reasons that we sometimes don't get the support we need. And it hurts, but we have to keep on keeping on and keep fighting the good fight.

I know it's a struggle, but you've got this.
I hope today is kind to you."
BPD,eqonesj,t3_byxbqc,1560190531.0,"I also do this! I don't even know why. I guess I try and justify it to myself by convincing myself that it's just exaggerating not lying...

Hey, at least we are all in this together!"
cowboybebop,eq2e2gz,t3_bx0i7d,1559734936.0,This is great! Would love to find another similar image for a nice matching lock/home screen on my phone. V cool!
BPD,eq0sfqn,t3_bwo3jg,1559693090.0,"100%. You've articulated this so well.

&#x200B;

""They feel equally valid to me"" struck me as aa really powerful statement. I guess I've always tried to brush my shadow self off as being ""not really me"". But, the things I feel in that bad place are just as valid as my feelings when I'm feeling good. 

&#x200B;

Thanks for this post."
BPD,epnkqj4,t3_bv7ozu,1559329002.0,"I feel the same way. I tried at the very least sitting in my garden instead of bed all day, but that just made me sad AND sweaty."
BPD,eomgnz7,t1_eomf4pj,1558688598.0,Thank you so much for this.
BPD,eoj28lv,t1_eoj18vs,1558631892.0,"That makes total sense. Maybe we should put this calmness towards death to some good use. Get into some extreme sports maybe, some kind of BPD adrenaline junkies meet haha.

Although these suicidal thoughts seemingly always existing, I am glad to read you're happy most of the time. That's a big success in itself. Lots of love to you."
BPD,eoiwlk1,t1_eoiw0o4,1558628799.0,"I'm hoping that one day we will get to a point where we are so well practised in our recovery that it stops requiring so much energy, and we'll be progressing in other areas without even realising it. Right?"
