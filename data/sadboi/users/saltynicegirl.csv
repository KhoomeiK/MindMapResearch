Healthyhooha,f41vb9o,t3_dj16x4,1571324264.0,"You already received some good advice here but I just want to throw in that it can be absolutely normal to smell down there after a day or exercise. Keep in mind that there is sweat and moisture that builds up and that vaginas just smell a bit in general. Just like your armpits it gets smelly after a while, you clean yourself and that's it (if you are healthy). And if you are very conscious about it you might notice it even more. So it's very important to talk to a doctor and if everything is okay, it's just your body and that's totally normal and fine. Don't think that everybody smells nice down there after a day of school or work. We all are smelly animals in the end of the day."

But in general I would say that you shouldn't be too hard on yourself. You'll get partners that are better than her, you'll get partners that will think you are better than anyone else and you'll get into relationships which make you better in bed because you'll get to practise. And you can always read and talk about sex, learn about it and try new stuff with someone you trust. Sex is weird and it doesn't have to be perfect and your worth isn't based on it."

They have fragile lungs and are prone to lunginfections. You can clean them by putting belly high water in a plastic container and put some cooked peas and noodles in to fish for. You can also put coconut oil on the fur. They will clean themselves while licking it off. You can also use a damp,soft cloth if something is really sticky. Old rats are usually cleaned by the other group members. If they are very smelly you should consider changing your cage cleaning routine and be sure that they are healthy. Rats are amazing and sweet but due to our breeding they have a high chance of getting respiratory disease."
wholesomegifs,f0y35gu,t3_d763tn,1569059282.0,"Even though it's cute please be reminded that you shouldn't bathe a rat until it's really necessary. That's because they are prone to infections and have sensitive lungs. They also clean themselves actually. The best way to clean a rat is to put on some coconut oil and let them lick it off their fur, cleaning themselves in the process or putting belly high water in a tub with peas and cooked noodles to fish for. Rats are amazing but their lungs are often very fragile."
wholesomegifs,f0y2qv1,t1_f0xy2gp,1569058957.0,You shouldn't bathe rats. If they are dirty you should put some peas or cooked noodles into a flat plastic box and fill it only until their bellies are covered. Or put some coconut oil on them. They clean themselves most of the time. Also don't let them become cold they are prone to infections.
