india,fdcbdxf,t1_fdcanq3,1578270901.0,"I understand what you’re saying, it simply adds to my helplessness towards the current situation. I’m a politics student, not being able to fight on behalf of the ‘other side of the substantial population who haven’t turned their backs against all the atrocities’ is killing me. Sitting 7000kms away, I can only offer words, and if they can reach the ones who are willing to put in more effort and fight off the attacks with doubled enthusiasm, I’ll try and give them as much moral support as I can muster. I’m a proud citizen of my nation, but I can’t tolerate for it to become fragmented into broken shards that I can’t even recognise as my own."

KindVoice,fcivju1,t3_ehbu4w,1577670843.0,"I know exactly what you’re going through, honestly and I just want you to know that you aren’t alone. Your suffering is real and I empathise with it. It’s okay to feel this way. For me, personally, I started meditating to calm the incessant noise in my head and to battle the silence outside. It’ll be difficult at first but try and start with a tiny target. 5-10 mins. Once you clear your head, slowly you’ll start to gain perspective. I’m 20f and still struggling. But meditating makes things slightly more bearable and a little clearer. I hope I could help. Sending positivity, love and a warm hug your way. :’)"
SuicideWatch,fc1nga6,t1_fc1n5cn,1577324037.0,"look, i don’t want to sound corny, but failing is proof that you tried, i’m not asking you to hope for better or hope at all, i’m not asking you to go up the graph, i’m asking you to stay, be consistent, maintain your presence on the graph, that’s all 
i honestly hope tomorrow is better for you, and the emptiness you feel is replaced with nourishment, sending you a warm hug"
SuicideWatch,fc1mxkc,t3_efmx50,1577323599.0," The important thing is that you got through this year. I’ve been suffering alone for a few months and honestly, I completely understand where you’re coming from, but from one sufferer to another, you’re so incredibly strong to be here and reading this today. You made it to this day, and that’s okay, that’s your achievement, and trust me when I say that the smallest of victories count, this one here is a big one.  The idea of death keeps crossing us and we keep fighting to live another day, us being here is a victory of that battle and that’s something to go on with. Maybe 2020 is a better year, maybe we barely survive that too- as long as we survive and work a tiny bit harder to make it better."
