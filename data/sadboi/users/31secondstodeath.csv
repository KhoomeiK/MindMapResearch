BipolarReddit,fqztbkh,t1_fqz9wm5,1589774883.0,"Thank you. And I understand. I'm not trying to make excuses. I realize it sounded that way re-reading it. It's the anger. I type like I talk when I'm angry. It's the anxiety-laden stream of consciousness firing off at my lips. And it's NY, I'm used to the cold. Lol. It's harder to step away bc of kids age and my wife's work schedule. She works overnights and sleeps during the day. So there's a 6 hour period or so every day that I can't physically leave the house without worrying about the kids and I have them solo overnight 4 nights a week. But yes, I do just go outside when I have to or I pace on the other floor of the house or I go hide in the bathroom, meditate in the shower. Something. We've read a couple books. Not those two though. So I will pick copies up. She gets a little offended sometimes when I ask her to read things. She's an intelligent woman and she's done her research. But, considering our current situation I think it could help. Especially the second one. Managing it within the household is the hardest part for us. I wish I could just find a stable med combo, but we're still working on that.

Anyway I appreciate you letting me rant and for your civility and aid in restoring some normalcy to me and my family."
BipolarReddit,fqz8x07,t1_fqt1vwa,1589762349.0,"Are you my yoga teacher?!? Much of what you wrote are the things I do. Meditation, box breathing (we call it square breathing here), and the mantra ""Sat Nam"" (Truth is my name). I am not a religious person nor a prayer but I understand the general similarities between those practices and meditation/yoga/mantras. I miss going to yoga (Kundalini). I took class at the YMCA 2x a week plus meditation class once a week. I even popped into a few others here and there occasionally. Hopefully it will open once again. Ive tried doing yoga at home solo and I just dont get the same result. I like the larger geoup energy. I'm very much an energy person. I lack the motivation as of late also to really care to try when home alone. But I have been doing a little with the kids (Cosmic Kids Yoga on YouTube). But mantras are quite helpful in distracting my brain to settle down. Sometimes going away from everything makes it worse. To go off and try to settle down when all your brain does is ruminate on the worst possible scenarios is hard. 

We live in a small house in the country on a 55mph road (that most people drive 70 on). So walks around the block can't happen. I can go to town and do it as town isn't far, but requires car travel. And if I don't have anyone to watch the kids then I can't walk away. They are 2yo and 4yo. I do try sometimes to just go outside, but the weather in Upstate NY this Spring has been cold as hell.  It snowed at my house on the hill I think 3x in May that actually stuck to the ground. That's messed up.

So not to type things twice necessarily you may want to peruse my response to the other comment as well. I ranted a little more there but insight can be had. And I do care for my family deeply. I don't have much left as I've pushed most people away in my life. I almost feel like now I'm doing it to my wife because she's who is left. She's tired and depressed and we're drifting. We talk about her and myself (moreso) frequently which is good I think. But I can see her pain and it saddens me to know that I'm the cause of someone else's unhappiness. 

Anyway, I appreciate your post and thank you much for the information. I like that first mantra and may try to remember that one in the future.

On a side note, do you have any advice as a SO for my wife? I don't direct her towards any forums for SOs as they are often filled with horror stories on life and I'm not sure that's the proper route for her to learn more. I've been this way for as long as I can remember. But I didn't get diagnosed until our second child was born and my sleep patterns went so bad that I went suicidal and they medicated me. A year and a half into lots of different meds I ended up in hospital for a few days. After another year med switching I think we're in the right ballpark. But it's still not right...  

Thanks again and DMs are fine if you'd rather offer SO advice in that route."

Joys of the food biz, lol. I definitely plan in talking to doc, but don't see her for a while. I've never used Discord. Used many chat services in the past when I was a big PC gamer, but now we live in the country with no internet other than our phones. I enjoyed the gaming companionship but it doesn't exist anymore. Is there a Discord app or something similar I could use? I have like 2 friends I can vent to as well that are almost always available but they've heard all this already and I think they even see me breaking. One of them is also bipolar though and we have similar lives so I have to be careful not to trigger her, especially when she's down. It's just the compounding of everything (no chiropractor for my tension headaches, 3 cavities I need filled, nerve problems in my right arm, possible wrist/hand damage in my left arm, medical bills for all above, skin issues from the lithium, tremors from the lithium, shitty sleep, bad side effects from sleep meds) during the pandemic while trying to be a stay at home dad for a 2yo and 4yo (2yo has been especially bad lately) and maintain a house and 1.5 acre yard covered in ticks thanks to a warm winter and wet spring. I also just went back to work part time just like 15 hrs a week to more or less get outta the house. But this job also could be causing the nerve problems in my arm. so I work 3 nights and am in pain or useless for the rest of the week. I find out more Friday about my arm at the orthopedic specialist. All I can hope is that I get some news. Something. Good or bad right now I don't care. I just need an answer about anything. My marriage is going downhill. My wife is exhausted and depressed. I'm working hard on trying to recognize the anger before it hits hard. As of right now I don't and I end up walking away after I start losing my shit. It's often too late at that point. Anyway sorry for the rant. I appreciate your response. Thank you."
AmItheAsshole,fkuq38g,t3_fixk8t,1584554035.0,"I have about $100k in student debt. I don't work in the field I'm trained as I'm bipolar I and I can't hold a full time job for more than 3-6 months.

Anyway, I refuse to let the government touch my wife's salary. She works hard and it's not her burden to take on my debt. She is mostly debt free and has made smart money choices most of her life.

Thus, we file separate taxes. Married, but file separately. You lose out on some credits and she gets less back than she would, but I'm a mostly stay at home dad and my very low salary working 15 hours a week part time and some minor Uber driving on college campuses keeps my Income Based Repayment plan at nearly $0 payment/month. She also claims the kids and anything else that could cause me to have excess money coming back that the government might garnish."
bipolar,fe3m8el,t1_fe3g7h7,1578850596.0,"Yeah that zombie feeling is rough and yes I frequently also have little memory of it. Or sometimes the memory of it floods back later in the day. For me sleeping 8 hours is hard, not just because I have to lay in bed that long, but just because of life. I need that time. So losing out on another hour or two when I wake up kind of makes me hate taking it. But god damn if it doesn't work. And generally speaking I think I am a slightly better human with those extra hours of sleep. So even 4 months in I'm still skeptical, but I'm still taking it every night. 

As for halving, maybe see if psych can give you 25 mg pills with twice the count so you can take 2 if you want to stay at 50 mg. That's what I do. The pills are so tiny I can't imagine splitting them accurately."
bipolar,fdx3yf8,t1_fdvzdzp,1578765061.0,"Try it for a week or two and see. My first experience with Seroquel was in the hospital and they gave it to me along with Ambien and Trazadone. The triple threat knocked me out. I thought it was excessive and my psych agreed and said I should just try the Seroquel. Trazadone alone doesn't work for me and I'm hesitant with Ambien because of the weird side effects people do while they sleep. I'm already prone to sleep walking and the like, I don't need it to be exacerbated.

I don't love Seroquel by any means and some nights I'd agree that it doesn't really work. Generally speaking though (I've been on it for 4 months now) my overall sleep patterns are better and even if I only sleep a little bit it is still a harder more thorough sleep. 

If I have a full solid 8 hours I know I can lay down for then I take 50mg. If I'm concerned that I'll have less than 8 hours I take 25mg. Seems to mediate the ""hangover"" I feel in the morning. 

I also have 2 little girls that frequently wake me up overnight. My wife works overnights 4 nights a week and the little ones (2 and 4) end up in bed with me or waking me up regularly.

Good luck. Hope it settles into a routine for you."
bipolar,fdpdqlo,t3_emki5z,1578626032.0,I take 25 or 50mg for sleep depending on a multitude of factors. It works. I sleep harder. I have a very hard time waking up quickly and being functional right away. It takes me 1-2 hours sometimes to function after wake up. That I don't like. Also take 900mg Lithium at night with Seroquel. Just take it right before bed and side effects are minimal. If I stay up for an hour after I take it I start to get the Seroquel munchies.

I'm bipolar 1 and am still working on finding a proper cocktail. My 3.5yo appears neurotypical. My 1.5yo is another story. I feel like I saw it in her eyes the day she was born. She is me through and through. The fear tears me up inside. At the same time... A bipolar child is hard to raise yes, but being raised by a bipolar parent makes that easier on the child. Having someone that understands what they're going through can make a huge difference. Honestly having kids is great, but find stability for yourself to some extent before having.

I also like that they keep me busy regularly (stay at home dad since I get fired from all jobs) and that keeps me from ruminating as much. My brain is only on fire sometimes now."

BipolarReddit,eqpftch,t1_eqpb42g,1560199201.0,"The last week has been the worst depression I've seen in her in probably 10 years. There's a lot of factors as to why the situation is the way it is. But, it's been building over the last few years. Problems with myself and med management, her 5 siblings whom she has always been very close too have essentially fallen off the radar with her since the beginning of this year.  She rarely talks to any of them. I used to ride her about never putting her phone down. That's how much they all talked. Now, nothing.  She's the youngest and we think it's just that they're all in different life places. Their kids are older, ours very young, etc... 

Anyway, as far as I know, the sisters know very little, other than me being bipolar and some shit from the past. Currently everyone in the family is too concerned with the alcoholic sister to focus elsewhere, understandably. I guess what I considered was calling her sister that she is the most like and probably closest too. Not going into detail with her but suggesting that they talk more and on a more personal basis like they used too. She misses them greatly. And her depression and sadness is starting to wear on me. I've been having a mixed episode for months. It's manageable. The swings aren't that high or low (anymore...🙄), but I can feel the lows getting lower over the last couple weeks.

We've been together a long time and I know her sisters well. I know the one I want to call would appreciate it and move forward with the info, but I'm concerned about how my wife would react. It's almost guaranteed that her sister would tell her I called.

Thus, I question whether that's a line I should cross."

As far as shooting other people it would only happen if someone came in my house and threatened my life or my families life.

I love target practice with the pellet rifles bc I can do it on my property, where I would have to go to a range to shoot real guns. There is something calming about it. Maybe it's the concentration taken to achieve the right shot. Maybe it's the satisfaction when you take that red center out of a target. I forget I'm bipolar when I'm shooting.
