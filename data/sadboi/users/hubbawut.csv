Anxiety,fnn8pno,t1_fnmzd85,1587086865.0,"I went through this earlier this year...it was affecting my health to such a degree that I thought it was some disease, too. It can be helpful to a point to talk with doctors about it (maybe not as much of an option right now unfortunately). Once I took in that multiple specialists were telling me they all felt it was persistent panic, I started to get better. 

Just remember that some crazy, rare disease is the LEAST likely cause. :) It's far, far more likely that panic is the issue. and panicking about having another panic attack is very common & can cause persistent symptoms like what you're describing. Taking note of any little thing that makes you feel better is important & can help you start building a better knowledge of what to do & what to avoid to help your symptoms calm down."
Anxiety,fkuxc6f,t1_fkux5qf,1584557896.0,"Hey me too! I've been going through the exact same thing. I think trying to focus on doing something for a while & letting your body take care of the breathing will really help. When we get dressed & over focused on breathing, we can end up taking shallower breaths or even breathing too deeply for too long. Best of luck, you're going to feel better soon!"
Anxiety,fkuw5zq,t1_fkutv8z,1584557267.0,"It can (for me at least) often feel like deep breathing or breathing exercises don't work but it helps me to remember that it's just science. Engaging the parasympathetic nervous system will always calm you down, at least to some degree. :) It's prevented me from going into a full blown panic ATTACK many times. Sometimes panic will persist for a bit but it pretty much always prevents a full attack. You can do 4-7-8 up to 4 times in a row. 

I get what you mean with feeling breathless all the time. My best advice is that it's a process to return to a state where you trust your body to just do the breathing for you. I try to stay focused on something else for as long as possible when I'm feeling like that to help myself remember that hey, the whole time I've been doing X thing, my body has been breathing just fine. Hope that helps a bit. :)"
Anxiety,fkt990a,t1_fks35f6,1584510337.0,"I experienced this for the first time, too, starting early February. One thing that's helped me is really taking in that a dissociated or depersonalized state is not dangerous. And the quickest way to become not dissociated or depersonalized is to accept the state as it is & do your best to go on about your life.

After about two weeks, I was mostly back to normal. It's truly just a last ditch response your brain takes to try to protect you from the physical toll of staying in a sustained state of panic haha. 

My anxiety also manifests in chest pains & racing thoughts lol. 4-7-8 breathing has saved me many times."
bassnectar,f6jrc1z,t1_f6iomi1,1572899047.0,"The blast of lasers kicks in late/off beat pretty frequently too. While I love the massiveness of the overall light/laser situation now, if you watch videos from the last basscenter that Smalley worked, lights/lasers/visuals are all SO much more in tune with the music & vibe at a given moment. 

I'll still go see him regardless (making me part of the problem here I guess) but with both sound & visual production, it's gone the way of ""just make it fucking bigger"" at all costs. I miss the subtlety of Smalley's approach."

bassnectar,ewdndn9,t1_ew8ccqm,1565303694.0,It is in full & without warning lol. Happened to me for Phish at moon Palace.
bassnectar,ev8z71l,t1_ev7847i,1564297865.0,Lol you cannot tell me that security anywhere would give a shit about a screenshot on your phone. ðŸ™„ I've cut the interior pocket out of a fanny pack before to ensure it only had one compartment & still been given shit at multiple venues.
bassnectar,eux4kgu,t1_eux1exs,1564083213.0,"It's not dicey. Only one or two people leave at a time to pee or get drinks and come right back. It's easy to keep one or two seats for 10-15 minutes. No one is going to the floor to hang out while still keeping a seat unavailable or wandering around.

It sucks to have to just sit there for so long but we have to because of the way the community treats seat saving now. There's no excuse, period, and it's not dicey. Pick floor or seats, have your entire crew with you when you get there, stay in the same spot all night. Peeps obviously have to leave to pee or get more water but do it in small groups & keep breaks short. This is where we're at now due to the insane seat saving. 

After seeing tarps at Nye & having to tell a spunion at be interactive that we wouldn't be moving even if his group of 30 friends ever showed up (and being told, ""y'all can sit there until they get here"" as if he owned two full rows), I think those of us who aren't entitled children are just fully over it. 

There's nothing complicated about it. Don't save seats."
bassnectar,euwsba9,t1_euw5f5u,1564078960.0,"Not everybody saves seats. Plenty of us show up very early with everyone in our group present & sit down together at the same time. And sit there for way longer than we want to before BN comes on with only short breaks, one or two at a time. 

If you wanna sit with your friends during the show itself, have your friends sit with you during the show itself. Seat saving the way this community goes about it is entitled as fuck.

(Referring to bleachers btw)"

Anyways thanks for all your hard work & hope the negative reviews of this place get proven wrong. We have faith, y'all just don't really help your case with nonsense replies like this is all."
bassnectar,eulrhxv,t1_euk5o0e,1563906255.0,Yep still available!

bassnectar,etsei6n,t1_etse5zu,1563143514.0,"Yeah at least there was some variety in his set. I just wish there were fewer openers. Or like, no openers lol."
bassnectar,etsdvd7,t1_etsd7ex,1563143043.0,"Glad I'm not the only one who feels this way. After three or four of them with little to no variety in overall sound/feel (within their own sets), it's just like make it stop lol. Appreciate that they don't throttle their volume anymore but three or four hours of nothing but maximum loudness just makes the time drag for real.

(Plz go ahead & downvote, just speaking my truth lolz)"
bassnectar,etscq1v,t1_etscc30,1563142191.0,"The openers always blow out the low end though. Bassnectar understands the concept of balance lol. I don't think they're actually louder, they just never let up for their whole sets. Truth was painful tbh."

mdmatherapy,erio7n0,t3_c275lm,1560902805.0,"I'm doing ketamine + IFS therapy for CPTSD) & it's going great. IM injections vs. infusions seem to work better (anecdotally). The therapy part (during the experience) is key. 

Unfortunately don't have access to MDMA therapy but also feel pretty strongly that more truly psychedelic experiences facilitate more productive, longer lasting, outcomes. Mushrooms are great for working through trauma too & the benefits last even longer than ketamine."

bassnectar,eqg33fs,t1_eqg2j2o,1560030975.0,There were visualizer issues right before & during his set...this sounds unrelated though.
