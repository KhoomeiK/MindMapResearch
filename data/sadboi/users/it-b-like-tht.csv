psychologystudents,fpj0c3u,t3_gdqrey,1588653147.0,"i just took a statistics course solely for the psychology major. i want to be a therapist so im prob not gonna have to use it too much down the line, but it‚Äôs one of those classes you kinda just have to get through. idk your school‚Äôs procedures or policies or anything, but you could even take STAT at your local community college and then just transfer the credit in (obviously talk to an advisor about this though as STAT is a foundation course for the PSYCH major at my school so it might be important to take it at your school but it could be an option). i think if you know you really wanna major in psychology and need to take STAT for the major, absolutely go for it. there are tons of resources too and also who knows, maybe you‚Äôll even like and understand it! it‚Äòs a lot different than other math classes you‚Äôve probably taken before so you never know! good luck!"
psychologystudents,fpiztdc,t3_gdqtad,1588652754.0,"I have anorexia and the treatment center I was at talked about how BMI is complete bullshit. it doesn‚Äôt say anything about health or the severity of someone‚Äôs ED so idk why people still consider it an important factor in determining the severity of anorexia. I think those in the ED field and those who are properly educated about ED‚Äôs know that BMI is bullshit. I‚Äôm also pretty sure it was taken out of the anorexia diagnosis, but the weight thing is still a problem with people being misinformed. It‚Äôs the thoughts, cognitive distortions and cognitions, behaviors, and emotional work that say so more about the place someone‚Äôs in with their ED. I personally don‚Äôt get why BMI and numbers and weights are such a big part of the anorexia diagnosis but not other diagnoses - for example, for BED, there isn‚Äôt any BMI severity scale or talk of weight or any of that shit and that‚Äôs how it should be. Any ED can occur at any weight, I think the BMI and anorexia thing is just a reflection of a misinformed, outdated way of understanding anorexia and other ED‚Äôs and hopefully they take out the weight and BMI shit in the future."

mentalillness,flj6y46,t1_flj6axy,1585200900.0,whats up? pm me?
mentalillness,flj68sd,t3_fp5c0c,1585200228.0,"i‚Äôm really sorry you‚Äôre going through such a hard time, i know how much it sucks. i know that it can be hard to truly believe and idk how much it‚Äôll help to hear this, but please just know that you are worth it. you are strong and courageous and worthy of peace, love, and happiness. i know that i dont know you or really anything about your life, but i see so much strength and resiliency in you. remember that there is a light at the end of the tunnel and things can change and be different. here for you if you want to talk."
mentalillness,flj5bkz,t3_fp4qih,1585199377.0,i definitely can relate to this with my eating disorder and i always felt so much shame because like why would i ever want to experience trauma. and like logically i don‚Äôt and i don‚Äôt want anything bad to happen to me at all. i think this ‚Äúwish‚Äù is more of our mind trying to invalidate and minimize our struggles. it‚Äôs like we feel if we had some big trauma we would have a more concrete reason or feel ‚Äúmore real‚Äù with our mental health issues. something i try to remind myself whenever i have these thoughts is that everybody‚Äôs struggles are different and it‚Äôs not a competition. struggling with depression and anxiety is a huge struggle and hard enough within itself. you don‚Äôt need to or deserve to suffer anymore. i can definitely relate though and it‚Äôs such an annoying and frustrating feeling. but just know that you are strong and anxiety and depression can stem from sooooooo many other things other than trauma. mental health issues are complex and hard. hang in there‚ù§Ô∏è
therapy,flj4dac,t3_fp4e44,1585198538.0,"ugh i relate to this soooooo much and im so sorry you feel this way bc ik how hard and lonely it can be. i think it‚Äôs super hard finding where you fit in and finding your people, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that you never will. sometimes environments or groups of people just aren‚Äôt right for us (like looking back at both my middle and high schools, i definitely didn‚Äôt fit in and they definitely weren‚Äôt the right environments for me), but that doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs something wrong with us or that we don‚Äôt belong anywhere. 

something i tend to struggle with is feeling comfortable in groups like im much more confident and comfortable socializing with people individually or in very small groups. i try to focus on fostering relationships that way bc i always feel like when i try to fit into a specific friend group or ‚Äúclique,‚Äù that‚Äôs when i end up feeling the most out of place and not myself and anxious and all of the feelings of not fitting in or belonging come up for me. idk if you relate to any of that, but maybe just trying to remember that groups are hard and so individual friendships or relationships might be a little easier to foster. 

i wish i had better advice or a more concrete solution but i feel like this is unfortunately one of those things that just takes time to figure out and navigate. relationships are hard and finding and figuring out the types of people you wanna be around takes time. i think it‚Äôs good you‚Äôre in college now (so am i) bc your world has and is hopefully expanding. as hard as it is, try to remember that there are people out there who will love and accept you for who you are. it may take some time and struggling to figure out, but know that you are worthy of those relationships and people and love and even though this is such a strong and difficult feeling (and is often deep-rooted), things can change and be different. hang in there my friend‚ù§Ô∏è"
EDAnonymous,flit12r,t3_fovj27,1585190017.0,omg right!! that is literally me like i‚Äôve never fasted bc i hate letting myself get ravenously hungry and almost never let myself get to that point. my goal was always to eat as much as i could for as little calories as i could and like blunt my hunger rather than wanting to be super hungry and operating on nothing. when i had to leave school for treatment my roommate was literally was like ‚Äúi mean you were eating your sandwich the other day and i see you eat‚Äù like ..... anorexia is not just eating nothing !!!!!
fuckeatingdisorders,flis44d,t3_fovmw1,1585189388.0,"toast, peanut butter, and sliced banana as an opened sandwich is one of my favorite breakfasts ever! so proud of you and hope you enjoyed it because it is BOMB! recovery ftw !!!"
mentalhealth,flgmvs8,t1_flfo65b,1585146196.0,yes!! a lot of people too can actually use it as a form of self harm or even suicidal behavior and yeah i personally don‚Äôt think they should show any pictures of anorexia or any ED‚Äôs in textbooks bc it makes people think that that‚Äôs what an ED is/looks like. like a lot of people with anorexia NEVER end up being hospitalized or even underweight. anorexia doesn‚Äôt always mean someone‚Äôs ultra-thin on the verge of death but that‚Äôs what everyone tends to think about (the extreme cases) and that‚Äôs just really damaging bc it‚Äôs a bad stereotype/misconception and also can make people with ED‚Äôs think their struggle isnt valid or real or they‚Äôre not sick enough bc they don‚Äôt look like that
BingeEatingDisorder,flfo2p6,t1_flfnym8,1585111993.0,ty!!! yeah thats what im going to try to do... i binged the last 2 nights in a row and feel so ashamed and really need to get back on track
mentalhealth,flfnbv1,t1_flfl63z,1585111343.0,"thanks for the reply! that actually means so much! i think that [this tumblr post](https://www.google.com/amp/s/the-healing-nest.tumblr.com/post/96457447460/what-eating-disorders-are-really-about/amp) is really good (not written by me) but basically i just feel like textbooks will talk about how, say, someone with anorexia will only eat X amount of calories and be super underweight and emaciated but not think so and i just feel like the view people have of an eating disorder is very very narrow like literally not everyone with an eating disorder restricts their food intake and not everyone with anorexia is super thin - you literally cannot tell that someone has an ED just by looking at them and it‚Äôs just such an annoying and dangerous misconception i feel when people (or textbooks) create this view of anorexia as being a white, upper-middle-class, emaciated female. and anorexia of course isnt the only eating disorder - there‚Äôs bulimia, binge eating disorder, ARFID, EDNOS/OSFED, orthorexia - so many others that people don‚Äôt talk about idk i always just feel like anorexia is the most glamorized which i also hate and i hate how even textbooks will show a picture of a thin white girl (usually a model) that had an ED it‚Äôs awful ANOREXIA IS NOT A BODY TYPE AND SOMEONE CAN STRUGGLE WITH ANOREXIA AT ANY WEIGHT !!!! (lol sorry if this comes off aggressive im just very passionate).

eating disorders also arent even really about food or body... like they are, but there are SO many other underlying issues and things going on and while the media/beauty standards are certainly triggers and difficult for people, they by no means cause eating disorders and i feel like sm people think that eating disorders are all about appearance and looks but they aren‚Äôt. like it‚Äôs hard to explain bc body image can definitely be a huge struggle for a lot of people, but many times, sm other things that are completely unrelated to body, appearance or food have to be dealt with like it‚Äôs in a very simple sense a coping mechanism/way to distract yourself from all the other more painful emotions you may be experiencing. your body becomes the problem and so you think it‚Äôs all about being skinny or looking a certain way (and this isn‚Äôt for everyone bc some ppl with ED‚Äôs actually want to gain weight to use their body fat as protection and others don‚Äôt even really care about their body that much) but really it‚Äôs about so much more than that - it‚Äôs about hating yourself, loneliness, feeling unloved and unlovable and unworthy of love, an intense fear of the future/need to suppress the past, never feeling good enough for people or feeling like you don‚Äôt belong or fit in anywhere, negative core beliefs you have about yourself, and SO MUCH MORE like these are just a few of the underlying issues that can be involved (at least in my personal experience but also knowing many others with ED‚Äôs) but there are literally so many things like ED‚Äôs are super super complex and complicated which is why i think its easier for people to just focus on the behaviors and weight and food or body - the superficial stuff that doesn‚Äôt really provide people with any valuable knowledge or understanding but it‚Äôs frustrating for someone with an ED bc you want people to understand you and it‚Äôs especially frustrating when textbooks or school settings have these superficial discussions bc it kinda just reinforces stereotypes or misconceptions people may have already had. 

so yeah lol this was super long so i appreciate if you actually read it all and thanks again for the response it actually makes me really happy to at least educate someone some of this stuff and if you have any other questions or wanna talk more please feel free to ask and reach out!!!"

EDAnonymous,fk1kf27,t3_ffwmej,1583781462.0,"I FEEL THIS SO MUCH!!! i literally get so easily triggered and annoyed by people not eating/not eating enough and i hate how much it affects me! but something I try to remember is that im only getting a small snapshot of their life and what they eat and one good example of this is one time i was eating dinner with my friend and i ate 100% of my meal but she didnt finish hers and it made me mad and uncomfortable with myself (even though the meal was not at all excessive, portioned for 1 person, and all that), but then we went to the library and literally like 20 mins or so later she got this huge brownie and it made me feel so much better. had i not stayed and gone to the library with her, i would‚Äôve been thinking ‚Äúwow she really only ate that much for dinner, how was she full from that, i must have overeaten, im so disgusting, etc.‚Äù but yeah i agree, people not eating or not eating enough is rly hard ESPECIALLY if you actually are eating"

fuckeatingdisorders,fi68pkj,t1_fi674la,1582183231.0,yeah like i just worry about every single social interaction pretty much so i think in my head i was like ‚Äúoh well if i send her an email then i can ‚Äúmake up‚Äù for my awkwardness or the things i wish i said but didnt/reword things but i dont want to be annoying or for that to be weird idek UGH im just having regrets idek
fuckeatingdisorders,fi61fkt,t1_fi610z0,1582175959.0,it is very triggering and shows a lot of pictures of models and then a picture of a model who died from anorexia and says her weight so idk if that would be the best thing to send but i can try to find it and send it if you really want. and so im pretty sure my professor already decided to just use a different portion of the documentary so thats why im not sure if i should email her again kind of just to follow-up/reach out again since she already kinda decided she wasnt gonna use the clip anymore idk i feel like i just never feel good about my conversations and this was hard for me to do so i was nervous and do afterwards i always almost wanna like go back and ‚Äúsay the right thing‚Äù or say things differently
EDAnonymous,fi2zp8c,t1_fi2w6ly,1582094633.0,oh yeah definitely that‚Äôs what my goal is and initially was like i want to kind of give a deeper education and understanding of ED‚Äôs i guess i just don‚Äôt know if i should tell her about mine like if it would be weird or change the way she thinks of me (relationships with professors can be tough in this way sometimes) but this also could just be me fearing stigma
EDAnonymous,fi2vtxb,t1_fi2vjn8,1582090711.0,"yeah that‚Äôs true like i do think it‚Äôs a good idea and important for her (and other people in more authoritative/educator-type roles) to know about ED‚Äôs and misconceptions I guess I just don‚Äôt know how to bring it up without saying like ‚ÄúI had an ED, I‚Äôm in recovery from an ED...‚Äù at some point and you‚Äôre right about the email but I feel like this is definitely something I‚Äôd feel better about in person (like yes it‚Äôs anxiety inducing but I think it would be easier to explain) but yeah idk maybe i‚Äôll write a ‚Äúdraft‚Äù of what i want to say i just don‚Äôt want to seem like im overreacting or being too sensitive of hyper-aware or anything idk.

CollegeRant,fhdps3n,t3_f29zjk,1581495602.0,"how many people do you live with? also, i totally understand your frustration especially because food is SO EXPENSIVE in college!! However, have you ever considered that one of your roommates could be struggling right now? You never know someone‚Äôs story and for all you know you roommate could be struggling with an eating disorder and may feel out of control around food. If that‚Äôs the case, I imagine they feel very guilty and upset and shame. Nobody chooses to have an ED or binge or purge or whatever behaviors are involved. And of course I am in no way implying that your roommate had an ED or anything bc I obviously don‚Äôt know much about the situation and everything but I feel like this is definitely something to maybe consider like I‚Äôm sure if one of your roommates even is stealing food, they‚Äôre definitely not doing it to cause trouble or be spiteful or anything. And saying things like ‚Äúwhat the heck who eats that much at once‚Äù or something along those lines can be really hurtful and come across as judgmental, which only furthers the awful feelings that person may or may not be feeling. Idk all I‚Äôm saying is that you don‚Äôt know what people are dealing with and approaching things with an open minded in a non-judgmental or frustrated or accusatory way can go a long way in terms of relationships and personal growth. (Also I am in no way trying to attack you or have this come across mean or judgmental in ANY way, I am simply just offering some of my insight). 

Now, I totally get the financial piece though as food (especially in college) is and can be very expensive and money is SO stressful!!! And your feelings and worries and frustrations are totally understandable and valid! Now I obviously don‚Äôt know everything about the situation and all but maybe you guys could come up with a plan surrounding buying food and paying each other back like all contributing. I think it can be hard to have things be kind of loosely talked about and not have everyone on the same page. Maybe you guys could all make a spreadsheet or document to come up with basic snacks and food that you all like and want to share and split the cost. Maybe you could say something like ‚Äúhey guys money is a bit tight for me right now so i was wondering if we could maybe talk about food an sharing stuff and come up with a more organized plan‚Äù and then you could discuss common snacks and foods that you all agree to share and split the cost by paying back whoever goes to actually buy the food (you guys could rotate week to week or however often you go grocery shopping). And then you could say something like ‚Äúyeah and id any one of us buys anything not on this list then maybe just label it with your name so we know not to touch it.‚Äù Oh course this can definitely be difficult depending on different people‚Äôs food preferences and all that, but it could be a more cost-effective way to buy groceries and coexist with your roommates without really getting into any arguments. And then you‚Äôre all on the same page. I just want to reiterate that with this situation, try to make it more about how YOU are concerned about money, food, etc. rather than accusing or mentioning how someone seemed to have eaten all this food. Try to make it about money and don‚Äôt make it about the missing food or comment on food or how much people eat or who ate what or anything like that. Both food and money can be sensitive subjects for people so just trying to keep that in mind and be compassionate for other people‚Äôs known or unknown struggles. Good luck :)"
college,fgv2un1,t1_fgue3y4,1581135567.0,"oh no they don‚Äôt need to know and i wasn‚Äôt planning on telling them or anything and by no means was i going to talk about any current struggles i was more-so just curious if at any point in a conversation if it seemed appropriate/was appropriate to talk about just to have like a deeper connection so they would get to know me more but i definitely am not planning on it, i was just curious about the relationship dynamic but i definitely see how it would be unprofessional. i‚Äôve just been at a treatment center where all the therapists who‚Äôve struggled themselves talked about it and everyone was just very open so i was just thinking of that environment and wondering if it‚Äôs like that at other places.

And I do see what you‚Äôre saying. I don‚Äôt want to go into psychology to understand my own illness, I feel that I‚Äôve done a TON of work already to do just that and so my motivation is to help others do the same. I want to go into psychology because I know how impactful therapy and treatment can be in people‚Äôs lives and I want to be able to help people overcome their struggles. I think it‚Äôs truly amazing to see people‚Äôs growth and self-realization as well as the strength and vulnerability people have. Like I mentioned, I was in a treatment center where therapists were recovered and staff were open about their past struggles in an obviously appropriate way (like not too often or anything like that but like i knew which staff members were recovered and stuff) and that really helped me and a lot of others because it gave me hope that like wow recovery really is possible. This is just from my own experience, but I feel like having past struggles can be a really positive thing because you can understand your clients better and also know what things helped/didn‚Äôt help you in your process (of course everyone‚Äôs different, but I think the understanding piece is really important). I‚Äôm by no means trying to argue with you or anything and I don‚Äôt want this to come across wrong, I just feel like people‚Äôs personal experiences can play a role in what they want to do and they can be really successful and good at it. As long as it obviously isn‚Äôt interfering, I think it can be a really powerful and cool thing."
college,fgu4ug6,t1_fgs5bwe,1581113412.0,"thanks for you feedback! that makes sense but i am wondering why you think it‚Äôs a bad idea (just in general, i obviously know about the supervisor thing) to talk about your own experiences as being part of why you want to get into the field. i‚Äôve known professionals who have talked about their own struggles and it actually has helped me feel more understood and also given me hope that things can change. so im curious as to why it‚Äôs a bad justification (and i know i put it simply and going into it on say a grad school app will be much different but still). do you have any experience/has anyone told you why it‚Äôs a bad idea?"

Like even now I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm restricting since it‚Äôs not the same as how I used to but I definitely lowkey am bc when I followed my meal plan from treatment I never binged so like I know that I‚Äôm not giving my body everything that it needs (hence the binging) now but it‚Äôs weird bc it‚Äôs like when I wake up sometimes I‚Äôm not super hungry or like I‚Äôll feel full/feel like I‚Äôm eating enough throughout the day it‚Äôs like my hunger cues are all out of whack because like I also don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm binging because I do eat throughout the day and sure it may not be what I used to in treatment or my full meal plan but it‚Äôs definitely not starvation so like idk it‚Äôs annoying bc it‚Äôs not like I fast or starve all day and like a lot of times I don‚Äôt even think I‚Äôm gonna binge it just happensüòï
eating_disorders,fg8ifpo,t1_fg8hz81,1580620476.0,thats so true and makes a lot of sense thank you! it‚Äôs like i know that as long as i stay in this lowkey restrictive mindset i‚Äôm gonna end up binging. ugh it‚Äôs just so hard to eat whatever i want when i want it after a binge. but i know that the way to not binge is to allow myself to eat whatever i want whenever. i just need to get out of this cycle but i always tell myself that i wanna lose weight first or something. idek UGH
college,ffsvre5,t3_euximz,1580194419.0,CONGRATS !!!! That is absolutely awesome and an amazing accomplishment! You should be so proud!! You‚Äôve totally earned it and your hard work has paid offüòä

BingeEatingDisorder,fd3c2dc,t1_fd1l9ot,1578156824.0,right!! or then for me im like ‚Äúim gonna be recovery-oriented and allow myself to eat the dessert bc ik the more i restrict the more likely i‚Äôll binge‚Äù AND THEN I FREAKING BINGE ughhhhh
BingeEatingDisorder,fd1bhbj,t1_fd13obf,1578129420.0,glad that you understand though
BingeEatingDisorder,fd1bg1x,t1_fd13obf,1578129406.0,aw yeah it‚Äôs so frustrating ughhh
BingeEatingDisorder,fd1b66m,t1_fd10fka,1578129375.0,thats a really good way to reframe things and try to have more autonomy and you‚Äôre right like it‚Äôs good real-life tests to put into practice and begin to take control of your recovery and life. of course easier said than done but thank you!
fuckeatingdisorders,fd0jnzw,t3_ejs7wk,1578119784.0,"yaaayyy thats awesome and such a great victory! i think this is such a great way to go about slowly challenging yourself to conquer some of your fear foods. although extremely difficult and uncomfortable, you are moving closer to full recovery and food freedom :)"
BingeEatingDisorder,fc6urkq,t1_fc6jobx,1577490023.0,thank you so much!!! that really makes me feel better and helped a lot. wishing you the best of luck in your journey as well since having an ED  completely sucks. we can win this fight!
eating_disorders,fc3rqry,t3_eg0h69,1577396965.0,i like this a lot this is a rly good way to think abt the ED
BingeEatingDisorder,fc2u6ht,t1_fc2cha6,1577374144.0,thank you so much! that really helps a lot! for me i feel like i will just continue eating something bc it tastes good and i havent had it in awhile and then feel the need to eat something else to have a different taste in my mouth as weird as that sounds like if i ate something really sweet i would then want to eat a little something savory or salty even if im fullüòï
BingeEatingDisorder,fc2tzzq,t1_fc2hqa3,1577373997.0,gotcha aghhh yeah it‚Äôs such a shitty cycle thank you for sharing though and don‚Äôt feel stupid writing this it was rly helpful and good!! :)
BingeEatingDisorder,fc22l6b,t1_fc21oj4,1577337892.0,"gotchaaa thank you! yeah i think i struggle with like eating something and then going back and being like ‚Äújust a little more‚Äù ‚Äúone more bite‚Äù and stuff like that and then i feel like im binging bc i keep eating but i also don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs for sure a binge or just overeating... i guess it depends on the situationü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòï. 

what do you typically do the day after a binge? i always want to restrict but have a hard time restricting so heavily bc i know it‚Äôs a slippery slope and vicious cycle and i usually just end up getting hungry and overeating"
BingeEatingDisorder,fc213sw,t1_fc1yyxd,1577336315.0,ohhh ok thank you! do you always know when you‚Äôre binging/did you have it planned or know it was going to happen when it does?
eating_disorders,fc1dxja,t3_efn23p,1577315869.0,"ugh i relate to this sooooooo much. my family hosts christmas every year so we‚Äôre left with all the leftovers and desserts and such so i totally understand how you‚Äôre feeling and it sucks. 

eating disorders suck and reading this makes me really sad because we deserve to live a free, happy life not consumed by our ED‚Äôs and overwhelming thoughts. i get the comparison with your family members and hating your body even more because of it but something i try to remind myself is that everybody‚Äôs body is different and i think our ED‚Äôs really beat us up and tell us that we‚Äôre worthless and ugly and all these mean things but they‚Äôre all LIES the ED tells us to try and suck us in deeper. body image is super super hard and definitely something i still struggle with A LOT. but something i try to think about is like if i were to try and get my body to look a certain way and lose a ton of weight and stuff, i would be MISERABLE and like i think back to the days when i was deepest in my ED and they were miserable so i try to ask myself ‚Äúis losing weight and being skinny worth being miserable all the time, tired, consumed and tortured by your ED, thoughts, and negative self talk?‚Äù 

and with the food (especially around the holidays), something i try to remind myself is that by eating let‚Äôs say, the desserts, im actively working to build a healthier relationship with food and even if you do ‚Äúbinge‚Äù or ‚Äúovereat‚Äù (which i also think is another thing our ED‚Äôs blow up and blow way out of proportion), try to think of those as small bumps in the road of figuring out how to have food freedom and also listening to what your body wants. after restricting certain foods for so long, your body is going to want more of it when you begin to eat it again or for the first time. it won‚Äôt last forever and if you keep allowing yourself to eat what you want and as much as you want, you‚Äôll begin to feel more in tune with your body and hunger and fullness and build a better relationship with food and your body. lol that was super long but i hope that you try to enjoy the rest of your christmas and holiday season!!"
askatherapist,fbw1trj,t1_fbw0udj,1577139320.0,"that‚Äôs great! i‚Äôm glad i could help and also, you can talk about anything with your school counselor - while they may not be able to do long-term therapy with you, they are trained and know how to respond to a ton of stuff like this. They also can‚Äôt break confidentiality unless you mention wanting to hurt yourself or someone else, child abuse, or are court mandated so pretty much everything you say stays between you two. I think the best way to approach is either going straight down and saying ‚Äúhey I was wondering if you were busy or if you had any time to talk this week‚Äù or emailing him and saying something like ‚Äúhey I was wondering if I could talk to you about some things. when would a good time be?‚Äù Proud of you for taking this step!"
askatherapist,fbvztug,t3_eeqa2a,1577138476.0,"Yes I absolutely think you should talk to your school counselor. In my own experience, I was struggling a ton with depression but didn‚Äôt feel comfortable talking to my parents and was too scared to go to my guidance counselor. I ended up talking to a friend and she actually went and told my school counselor who called me down to her office where I ended up opening up. It sounds super scary but it really wasn‚Äôt and she helped me call my mom and talk to her so that I could get into therapy. 

Fast forward a few months, I was in therapy, got on medication, and started feeling a lot better. Depression sucks and is exhausting to have to deal with day-to-day. You don‚Äôt deserve to be consumed by your depression and things can and will be different. Opening up and reaching out for the first time is the hardest part but it will be well worth it."
AnorexiaRecovery,fbn7t43,t3_eduutd,1576993885.0,"omg i literally relate SOOOOO MUCH. it sucks and is so frustrating. you seem really motivated for recovery though and i commend you for your strength and self-awareness. it‚Äôs awesome that you‚Äôve explored and thought about some of the underlying issues that drive your ED. i think that shows a great sign of wellness as you‚Äôre able to recognize things in your life and feelings that make urges strong and high. do you have a therapist rn? i think talking to them would help and hopefully bring you some relief. this is truly a vicious and frustrating cycle and i completely understand what you‚Äôre feeling. it‚Äôs so hard but something i try to remind myself is that living life fully in an ED is even harder bc it literally negatively affects all aspects of your life. recovery is not linear and there are many ups and downs but i truly believe that if we continue on the path to recovery, eventually it will become easier. stay strong!"
lonely,fbmtos9,t1_fbmscoc,1576988757.0,for sure!! yeah i agree its good to help others and share stories bc i remember struggling sm in middle and high school and so its nice to talk to ppl going through similar things and remind them that things that seem like the end of the world now wont be in a few years. and yes ive found sharing personal experiences to be super helpful for both me and hopefully others and its really nice to be able to do it on here lol
lonely,fbmqo7e,t1_fbmqefu,1576987710.0,so true!! and lol i really loved and appreciate your response and its awesome that you were and are able to open up and talk about this!
lonely,fbdr5k7,t1_fbdhfsy,1576769440.0,"exactlyyyy like i look back at my high school self and cringe at how insecure i was and how much i cared about stupid, superficial things. so glad to be done with high schoolüòÖ"
lonely,fbdr2s8,t1_fbcr8g9,1576769389.0,aw no problem! im glad i could help and lol i hope you werent offended if i said middle school its hard to tell over the internet but i figured you weren‚Äôt in college yet
lonely,fbcohbr,t3_ecnksi,1576729042.0,"aw i totally empathize with you it‚Äôs really hard to feel like you don‚Äôt really have people. im really sorry you‚Äôre feeling this way and totally understand how lonely it is and feels. 

however, your life doesn‚Äôt have to and won‚Äôt always be like this. it sounds to me like you‚Äôre either in middle or high school (correct me if im wrong) and for me, those were some of my worst years. i felt just like you like i had no friends and was super alone. but as you get older, you‚Äòll meet new people and start to develop better, deeper relationships. it‚Äôs hard when you‚Äôre young and it seems like everybody else has all these friends but i find that a lot of times those friendships are surface-level and will probably fade out (it‚Äôs not a guarantee and people can certainly stay friends but don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs the end of the world if you haven‚Äôt quite found your people yet).

friendships are hard. im 20 and still figuring out friends and relationships. it‚Äôs an on-going process and that is completely ok. try to give yourself grace and remember that things won‚Äôt always be like this - it may take time, but you‚Äôll begin to find people who you truly click with. sending you some love & good vibes as i know how hard this is and can be."
eating_disorders,fbbva33,t1_fbbd9i9,1576708926.0,thank you!! and yes im definitely going to keep that in mind lol i feel like my body‚Äôs been through so much this past year i need to remember to treat it well
eating_disorders,fbbaaml,t1_fbaztdn,1576696295.0,THANK YOU!! that actually helps so much i really appreciate it and that‚Äôs good to know about the wisdom teeth thing bc i think im lowkey trying to use it as a way to restrict but i shouldn‚Äôt bc like what is that doing for me ya know. Thanks again and best to you!!
therapy,fb0oese,t1_faxaud9,1576427837.0,no problem!
therapy,fax56uc,t3_easj5d,1576378895.0,"depending on how long you stay in it, you can really explore a lot of different parts of yourself and learn so much about who you are and who you want to become. at least in my experience, ive ended up doing a lot of work on myself bu processing past experiences, current challenges, relationship and social struggles, and kind of just facing all the difficult emotions and things in my life that i suppressed and ignored for so long until they manifested and came out as part of my ED. it‚Äôs a really great thing and the work you do on yourself will prob be the hardest work you‚Äôll ever have to do and I believe that it‚Äôs an ongoing and continuous process throughout life but therapy helps guide you in the right direction and kind of begin that process so you can live a happier and more satisfying life"
therapy,fax3vpk,t3_eat2i1,1576378423.0,"i would definitely talk to your therapist and a psychiatrist about anti-depressants. i know for me they made the WORLD of a difference and i couldn‚Äôt imagine what my life would be like had i not gone on them. it‚Äôs definitely a personal choice and different journey for everyone and i‚Äôm not a professional or anything but in my own experience, ive found them to be very helpful especially bc i was trying therapy for awhile and wasn‚Äôt feeling any better and kind of like you, i was actually just feeling worse and worse since i wasn‚Äôt feeling any better with just the therapy alone so i‚Äôm sorry that you‚Äôve been feeling that way. it really sucks and is super hard but i commend you for your strength and courage especially with seeing a therapist and being open to different things that could potentially help you bc i know for me, seeing a therapist was super scary and something i kept putting off and off and off so i definitely think you‚Äôre on the right track to helping yourself and feeling better!"
therapy,fawzl49,t1_fawcsmp,1576377071.0,ohhh ok thank you yeah that‚Äôs definitely something i‚Äôll look into. right now i was just thinking master‚Äôs and maybe trying to become an LPC but who knows! i dont have a psych advisor right now bc i‚Äôm not a declared major yet (still have to take research methods which i can‚Äôt take until next fall) but yeah i really wanna get as much experience as i can i just feel like rn im not established enough as a student and not even a declared major so it‚Äôs hard to find stuff but im definitely planning on getting involved as soon as possible! thanks again for all your help!
therapy,favy6la,t1_favg63o,1576363536.0,yeah thats so true! i guess i just feel like whenever i don‚Äôt know what to say/don‚Äôt know if what i said was helpful my thoughts start to snowball and then all the sudden im doubting my ability to be a therapist even though the situations are way different but it‚Äôs good to hear that you‚Äôve become more comfortable with practice and time and training. I definitely think that‚Äôs what helps and since I literally am just starting my undergrad career I really havent had much experience to help me build confidence in myself but im hoping that‚Äôll come with time as i become more established as a student and stuff! and congrats on getting your masters! thats awesome and definitely a super big accomplishment.
EatingDisorders,fau8gno,t1_fasvcm8,1576345613.0,"true! yeah thats really important for me to remember and also to zoom out a little and remind myself that at the end of the day, people like you and remember you for who you are and nobody really cares what your body looks like (and if they do they prob have their own shit/might not be good ppl to have in your life) but yes health is wealth !!!"
EatingDisorders,fau8403,t1_fat4m17,1576345492.0,omg right!! and i know how slippery of a slope it is too bc i want to recovery especially since ive made it this far but it just feels like some things will never change and body image is one of them for me that i just feel like will never be good idk i always hear that it‚Äôs the last thing to go but ugh its so hard!! but thank you! sending love your way too this isn‚Äôt easy but we got this‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

study,fao5bdu,t3_ea6mch,1576257577.0,for psychology i usually write out all my notes and make a quizlet. there‚Äôs a good chance you can find a quizlet online that has the info you‚Äôre learning so maybe do that and see what you do and do not know. you do have 5 days so that‚Äôs definitely still a good amount of time and not super last minute if you start today. if you‚Äôre feeling pressed for time though maybe start with what you don‚Äôt know and end with what you‚Äôre more familiar with. good luck!

study,fajfgba,t1_faj1519,1576135257.0,"I think it depends on the subject and how you learn. For me, that‚Äôs just what I‚Äôve always done to study but last week I had 2 exams on the same day so I didn‚Äôt have as much time to fully study each subject so I used the study guide my teachers provided and typed out some of the answers/notes instead of hand writing them. It probably helped with time but I was also kinda familiar with some of the terms but you could try typing and see what works for you!"
