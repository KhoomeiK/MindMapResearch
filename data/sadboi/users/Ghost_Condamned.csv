MetalMemes,fo9gwuq,t1_fo9g1aq,1587619204.0,"Yep! Mind you the first wave of black metal was composed by extremism, satanic propaganda(some artists later in life admitted that it was just an acri of youthful rebellion) and so on.

Unblack metal bands like Antestor were highly against church burning so the reaction that they received was just.. Expected.

Today it didn't happen anymore, black metal bands now just mind their own business and sometimes the ""satanic side"" it's only an artistic choice, nothing more.

But some bands, orthodox black metal(aka religious black metal) are pretty different and more ""into"" the thing, using a strong literature, taking some christian passages(like chants for examples or some verses) using it in a very different way under a different view(bands like Deathspell Omega ""si monumentvm..."", Ondskapt ""Draco sit mini dux"", Funeral Mist ""salvation"" just to mention some strong examples)."

I wrote some chamber pieces(clarinet quintet, two string quartets) and for those I used a very classical approach, I went after some motifs and such, using a stable form, thinking about the general mood and then I wrote down fairly quick.

For the symphonic poems... That's another story, I first proceeded to analyze my subject deeply before even put a note down. After the analysis I transformed the elements that I gathered into musical fragments, give them a coherent narrative.

But overall once I decide what I want to do I just go on the piano(I'm not a pianist btw) and start writing down."
