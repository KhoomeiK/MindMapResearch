I'm an atheist and I told my parents about it a year ago and she wanted to kick me out. When my father refused she decided to leave just because I don't believe in her god. They're muslims, it's Ramadan right now and i'm forced not to eat just to please their retarded piece of shit of a god.

2 years ago I was in a relationship with a girl whom I was super attracted to physically and she was too. So my mom would look into my msgs (weird teenage sexting i don't wanna get into that). And she ruined it for me, I no longer have anything to do with that girl and she was absolutely the one for me.

What else ? let me think.. Oh everytime it's dark and there's no noise I hear screaming like i'm schizophrenic. Everytime when there's silence her screams haunt me. Screaming at me, at my little brother along with the physical abuse and beating we both had when we were little kids (my brother still is a kid tho).

Yeah, I feel you man."

Note: these animals have no moral codes, they're not as self-conscious as human beings and they're simply not aware of the shit they're doing. But we humans have morals, that's why we consider pedophilia an ""illness"" when in fact it's not. Again, whether you like it or not."
