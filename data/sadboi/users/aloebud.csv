BPD,flib603,t3_fow77e,1585178897.0,"Tbh, i’m different with every relationship. My ex, i panicked and constantly needed him to reassure me that he wasn’t leaving me and still liked me. With another ex, it ended for me without him knowing that it has ended."
BPD,fk17t7y,t1_fk114w9,1583774158.0,omg i thought i was the only one that emulated my FP’s FP!
ADHD,fj2e3mi,t3_fawsc8,1582941323.0,"Nobody really knows about my adhd except for friends and family and even then, i don’t think they understand or realize when i’m in a brain fog so i do come across as stupid or something but they never make me feel like i’m unintelligent. They mostly just deal with it and try to end the convo soon, which i appreciate lol."
ADHD,fivpoek,t3_f9ublo,1582765297.0,"I struggle with this too, but I still manage to brush my teeth every single day. When i wake up in the morning, I ALWAYS have to piss like a racehorse. So what i do is after i’ve peed, i brush my teeth right away instead of washing my hands. Because if i wash my hands first, I won’t brush my teeth. So i brush teeth, then I wash my hands."

BPD,fbigjhi,t3_edidey,1576900349.0,"yeah. i usually have dreams about being loved and given attention and when i wake up, i feel so sad for the rest of the day and sometimes days after. i also have nightmares about my past trauma and wake up and i’m so terrified and feel like it was really happening. i can’t go back to sleep for a while after because i’m shaking and my heart is pounding."

MaladaptiveDreaming,f9dqqz1,t1_f9dkodr,1575235980.0,"I feel like maybe if someone noticed one was daydreaming, they could bring them back to reality and maybe ask them about their daydream if they’re willing to share, or maybe even let them finish their daydream? Haha, idk!"

MaladaptiveDreaming,f9dblf9,t3_e4ldu1,1575232007.0,"And also, automatically imagining something that someone tells me about. It’s so annoying sometimes because i stop paying attention to what they’re saying to me."
MaladaptiveDreaming,f9dbhug,t3_e4ldu1,1575231976.0,"Omggg, I relate so hard. I always told people about how I day dream in someone else’s perspective and they look at me like i’m crazy."
