ExPentecostal,fp14acg,t3_gakv0l,1588224008.0,"I used to think that ""prophecies"" meant that the pastor could read my mind/see through my life memories. 

For context, whenever pastors from out of town would come for revival, they'd end the closing service with a time for ""prophecy"" after speaking tongues. It was when they'd go to a random person & supposedly give them a word from God about details of their life that only that person could know...I used to be terrified the pastor would one day stop in front of me & say my struggles/sins out loud in front of the whole congregation (which he'd usually do). It sounds wild now, but I was seriously so terrified!"
ExPentecostal,foyvc3r,t1_foy58z1,1588179850.0,">Straight up, because we were literally brainwashed man. We were taught to believe a slew of shit that simply does not exist, and undoing that takes time.

What worked best for me was honestly to cut the church out completely for a few years. It helped best with unlearning because I saw how utterly insane the things we were taught were. If I saw a Christian therapist, they wouldn't understand. I think an ""outsider"" therapist who isn't a Christian could help a lot, if they are a good therapist in general :)"

ExPentecostal,fotkhdh,t3_g9gyd0,1588056735.0,"I left church 7 years ago because I wanted to go to college. It was the best thing I ever did, but I'd be lying if I said that the trauma didn't follow me there. After a while, I realized I desperately needed to go to therapy to face the past. It's been a very painful, yet completely worthwhile process. Most importantly, I've learned that I *can* learn how to live a healthy life outside of the church. I *can* unlearn of all the lies that the church fed. I *can* move on from this trauma. 

I'm so sorry you are going through this. Nothing will ever make that upbringing okay. But **you** are not that upbringing. You are your own person, and so capable of moving forward from this - you already are, even though it will take time. But it's worth it, because you will slowly discover yourself, & the kind of life you want (and deserve to) live. You are worth it. What the church did will not rule over you forever. You've already left, and that's the biggest step. I hope this helps. This sub is a community of support who are all going through this together."
Tagalog,foklyjg,t3_g7y0da,1587844546.0,"""Ho"" is less formal than ""po,"" and I've seen family members use it with strangers they encounter in day-to-day activites (ex. at a market asking how much something is). Or cousins having very casual conversation with an elder we know well. Personally, I always use ""po"" and never ""ho"", just to be as respectful as possible."
CPTSD,fogm57k,t3_g79971,1587754349.0,"Yes. Whenever I try new things, I always do it by myself 99% of the time, if it can be helped. I'm horrified to make a mistake around others, because I fear I'll be chastened, which is a knee-jerk response from my childhood. My parents (and all the other adults around me - it's a cultural thing) always expected me to know exactly what to do, in 1 specific ""right"" way - and if I didn't do it in that ONE exact way, I'd get chastened and yelled at.

I'm now learning that **there's no ""one"" way** to do something, **especially** if it's your first time doing it. You're **supposed** to make mistakes, not avoid it. And making mistakes isn't a sign of failure, it's actually a sign you're doing it right - because that's how you make progress. :)"
Tagalog,foeqw5v,t3_g72xic,1587711710.0,"Native speaker — the literal translation that comes to my mind is, “Gusto mo ba ang pag-ibig?”

BUT as someone else mentioned in this thread, it sounds unnatural & awkward, so I wouldn’t recommend its use to express “Do you like love?” as it really just doesn’t convey the same meaning it has in English. 

I saw another comment mentioning this translation — “Gusto mo ba ng pag-ibig?” But that, on the other hand, means more like, “Do you want love?”."
CPTSD,fobxoe0,t3_g6ne95,1587664827.0,"Yes, and completely agree with the other comments in this thread!

I come from a very traditional Asian (not Asian American) family, and I felt so much of what you described. I'm only 24 and I can't say that I no longer struggle with depression or self-hatred, but I hope some of what I say here can offer even a bit of a empathy and support. It's what I tell myself whenever I feel horrible:

Don't blame, get mad at, or be disappointed in yourself for: where/who you are now vs. where/who you were before. The truth is, both the you who uses phones & the Internet to escape, can never get anything done anymore, etc. + the you who excelled in their studies, was social, ""the perfect Asian daughter"", etc. are just as worthy of love and support as the other. They're both you. 

Don't blame, get mad at, or be disappointed in yourself for: escaping to find relief. **You're doing great**. You're trying your best to survive, even if your best now isn't at all like your best before - they're both your best. Your coping & escapism is the rational response to what you're experiencing, and there's nothing wrong with that. Your emotions & responses make complete sense because you're depressed, and although it feels awful, there's nothing wrong with you for feeling it + responding to it with escapism. Who wouldn't try to escape from that depression? It's not just in your head, it's real. 

Lastly - it's okay if you feel as if you can't handle or live up to your family's expectations. I know that that's completely counter-intuitive to what your culture says, but honestly, those expectations are impossible to live up to. And that doesn't mean that you're a failure of a child, not being filial, or ruining their sacrifices for you (heard that last one a lot growing up). 

\-----

Sending you love & support, OP. I'm rooting for you."
