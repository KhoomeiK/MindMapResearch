I have had all these awful experiences and I see how they any are affecting my life and I haven’t been able to discuss them with anyone. I want to lash out sometimes to keep from being hurt. If there was anyone around, an actual human who would speak to me, I would be able to deal with it better. It’s been so long since I have had an actual relationship with anyone that I don’t know how to relate to anyone. I am sorry you feel scared by yelling. It’s their weakness, or defensiveness, or fear."

I was really surprised! I am feeling much more grounded now see how my anger is protecting me from drowning in a huge sea of grief. I am glad I found this group and have a place to be able to vent."
