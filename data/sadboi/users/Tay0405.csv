I used to forget to eat all the time back in high school but with this shut down and nothing to do I feel like it's the only thing I'm interested in doing.

My issue is this....I'm still struggling with extreme depression even though my mental motivation seems to be returning. I thought by putting weed down I would start to feel better overall, lose weight, and start to like myself more. Here lately I can't stand myself or who I am. I havent lost any weight either despite not eating myself into a coma like I used to when I did smoke. In fact the scales haven't budged a pound. I really just don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to go back to smoking and dont plan on ever going back. I guess I just want to know how long it takes to ever feel good about myself or like who I am again. I'm a 26 year old woman & I feel so lost. I'm anxious, bored, depressed, overwhelmed, and defeated all at the same time.

I can tell you it does nothing but waste time and money and make you feel worse as time goes on and your brain becomes accustomed to it. I prayed, screamed, cried and begged for weeks that I would get through the night sweats, horrible dreams, nausea etc from ridding my body of THC. Its not worth it. Weed today is nothing like weed from years ago...the THC levels are crazy high and far more addictive than what was once known as weed. I wish I'd never touched it. It took me 62 days to pass a drug test after 6 years of smoking all day every day. I started smoking at 17/18...I just had my 26th birthday.

I never could relate to other females as I have no maternal instinct and no desire to ever have kids. I'm 26 now. I feel alone all the time despite being in a relationship for 7 years.

It becomes nothing but a time and money waster that makes you feel worse despite what society tells you and makes you think or believe. That's because it starts out slow and it works like a credit card...you get what you want out of it for the time being and then pay for it tenfold afterwards. I was caught up in the belief that it helped my anxiety, depression and isolation when it secretly it only made it worse. It is a false delusion that alters the chemical makeup in your brain and if you can quit smoking long enough to pass a drug test again, you'll see exactly what I'm talking about. I'm 85 days clean and feel better than I have in absolute YEARS. I attempted suicide twice. I hope you'll take this message to heart and consider what I've said. There are hundreds of thousands of people that have said the same and have started their journey to quit. I recommend doing some research on what weed truly does to your mental health over time as it functions like an emotionally abusive relationship that twists your perception.

A virus is not alive....therefore it cannot be killed....you either learn to live with it or you create a vaccine for it to introduce the immune system in how to fight it. That's the number one thing they teach in microbiology when it comes to viruses. By quarantining people, it's going to prolong how long this lasts. When the virus runs out of people to go through, it can go no further. They created a vaccine for the flu & they still havent cured the flu. The CDC has now stated multiple times that this virus cannot mutate any further than it already has. People need to turn off main stream media and use their heads and common sense. My gut feeling (and I'm right about a lot of things believe it or not) tells me this will disappear within the year and never talked about again until it hits the history books.

By asking me if I'm ok with 7 million people dying is ridiculous....I guess you're okay with more people than that dying & not being able to make ends meet and possibly losing everything they have but that's none of my business. I'm pretty tired of people like you taking everything to the extreme when it doesnt have to be that way at all. Chances are it wont effect you physically in the slightest or anyone you know. Youd rather scream and cry over a worst case scenario that isnt going to happen and buy into this agenda that's fearmongering. I dont buy things on impulse. I dont go shopping that much but good grief, it would be nice to be able to plan my wedding & go somewhere outside like the beach. It would also be nice to go to the dentist so I can get my teeth fixed because I'm in a lot of pain. I'm out of contacts as well & dont have any glasses. I don't guess I deserve to be able to see along with millions of others. My dad also needs to have a serious surgery that theyve rescheduled twice now because of this mess. I guess my dad deserves to die."

Discussion,fnxdkxm,t3_g4fnif,1587336468.0,"I'm just not sure what people expect to be done about school shootings....everything that's been suggested has been turned down by mainly the left. Its almost like people dont actually want their kids to be protected, they just want something to bitch about. I thought it was a great idea to arm the teachers (if they wanted to be once they passed a training class) people freaked. School shootings will stop and parents will start checking little Johnny's backpack before they go to school if they thought for a minute the teacher might shoot their ass back in defense. Kids shoot up schools because they know nobody is armed. Period. There are hundreds of gun laws. States need to either enforce those laws or hush. Until someone can tell me how they plan to keep guns from criminals, this will continue."

antiwork,fnwredb,t3_g47iud,1587323957.0,"I disagree entirely. We cannot shut down the country every time a new virus comes to life. It's not sustainable and the numbers simply do not match up to the hype at all. The way people are acting, you'd think we were dealing with the bubonic plague. I've never seen people behave this way over a virus that has a 98% survival rate. People with compromised immune systems need to take extra precautions and stay at home. It's fine if you want to shut down touristy areas but it makes no sense to do this where I live."
SuicideWatch,fnwqa0z,t3_g48v49,1587323330.0,I promise you things get better after you get out of high school. It doesnt seem like it now but in 5 years you'll be glad you held on. I thought hard about committing suicide at the same age you are right now. I fought through it and now I've done things I never would have imagined. There is a life outside of high school and your parents home. I promise.
AskThe_Donald,fnv1t17,t3_g40giw,1587277478.0,"I voted for Trump because I was ready for actual change. I didn't give a shit about this ridiculous sensationalism or the man's personal life. For example: Stormy Daniel's was the LEAST of my worries and I also didnt care about his ""locker room"" talk or his ""grab em by the pussy"" phrase (im a 26 year old female). What I cared about was what he was willing to bring to the table & knew he couldnt be bought out like so many other career politicians. I do not agree with every single thing the man does or says. I think there's alot of people in his current administration that cause him more harm than good. I'm honestly just sick and tired of everyone being so offended by his words instead of praising the man for his ACTIONS. Actions will always speak louder than words for me and he has done ALOT for this country. He's JUST the president out of 3 whole branches of government & our mainstream media really makes him look worse than he really is. I've met the man personally. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are worse people than Trump will ever be. When it came down to Hillary or Trump, I was Trump all the way. She did not deserve the title of first female president with all the baggage & scandals shes been apart of. As far as Bernie Sanders goes, I feel bad for how the DNC has treated him. I dont see how any Bernie supporter could continue to vote democrat personally, but I've also lost a lot of respect for Bernie too for just rolling over and selling out. Not once but twice. I will absolutely be voting Trump again in 2020. If the people would learn to work with him instead of against him, we could really go far as a country but unfortunately, people's hate for him outweighs the love they should have for their country so it will never work. I'm not Democrat or Republican either btw. There are just as many people I don't like on the right as their is the left. With Donald Trump, I felt we could have the best of both worlds. If trump were truly a racist or a homophobe. He would have already taken their rights. No matter how many times a person screams these phrases at the man, it just doesn't make it true. At all."

Discussion,fmb63lu,t3_fqwqum,1585919317.0,"More people are going to die from the fallout of this than the virus itself but you're not ready for that conversation. Crime is escalating, child abuse is escalating, suicide will escalate, gun violence will escalate, and the health care system will be even more overwhelmed than it already is. Even you are still going to work. The rest of us dont even know when well get to go back to work. I literally dont understand this mindset of risking the lives and livelihoods of millions of people for the sake of a few thousand for a virus that has a 98% recovery rate. Yes people will get sick but no the majority of those people WILL NOT DIE."
Discussion,fmb5qkp,t1_fmb3ygv,1585919045.0,Yeah you're 100% apart of the problem if youre not willing to quit your job to stay at home to keep from spreading this virus.  Sounds pretty hypocritical to me. You telling people to stay at home when you're going into work. Sounds like about right. Not once did I praise Trump but I'm not going to take a shit on the man either. I'm not a Republican but i sure as hell am not a crazy left liberal.
Discussion,fmak7ho,t1_fma7hwb,1585896983.0,You're being ridiculous. A virus is going to spread through all people until it runs out of people to spread through. The only reason we're staying at home is to slow it down and not overwhelm the healthcare system. Most people already have it and dont even know it because they dont show systems....I have 3 doctors in my family. Yes it's going to get bad in some states but absolutely not mine. What you need to do overall is chill the fuck out. The democrats make themselves look horrible every single day with how they're choosing to respond to this and how they shit talk Trump on the daily. Please go find something to do.

Discussion,fltjnqx,t1_fltjl90,1585475765.0,"I think we'll be fine. Honestly I'm more afraid of going broke and the economy completely crashing before I am afraid of this virus. If I get it, I get it but I'm ready to go back to work. Worst case scenario, I die and dont have to worry about bills or anything else anymore. That's my take on it."
Discussion,fltjchx,t1_fltj3a6,1585475375.0,"Oh because it's a virus...a virus doesnt die you just learn to live with it, become immune to it or create a vaccine for it. Right now the virus is real yes but how we are responding and reacting to it is beyond extreme. Do they expect to do this everytime a fast spreading virus comes around? The media has created widespread fear over the worst possible scenarios instead of looking at the best case scenarios. If you turn off the news and read what actual doctors and the CDC is saying, most people who get it will survive. They just will. It's really just being used right now to the advantage of the left to see how Trump reacts to it and make him look bad. When November comes around and the elections are over, this virus will not be talked about in the media just like you dont hear about ""children in cages"" anymore. Once the virus goes through everyone it wont have anyone else to spread to. We become immune to it and we move on. Theyve already said it doesnt mutate beyond this."
