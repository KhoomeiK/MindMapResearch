Anxiety,fmamce0,t1_fm7qzkx,1585899223.0,"Thank you for taking the time to reply to me. The next time I have one, which I really hope I don’t but odds are I will, I will try to do that and pray that it works for me."
Anxiety,fmam5g4,t1_fm7oilc,1585899016.0,"Thank you. It looks like I have a lot of reading to do. I would love to get therapy and get some help, but I have no idea when I will be able to do that due to this coronavirus outbreak."
Anxiety,fmam39z,t1_fm80vv4,1585898951.0,"I really wish you wouldn’t have to cry yourself to sleep, but thank you for showing me that I’m not alone. I really hope we can both get through this and be okay. That’s what I’m praying for."
Anxiety,fmalyfr,t1_fm7qtgc,1585898805.0,Thank you for being so thoughtful.
SuicideWatch,fmak9t0,t3_fu3fzb,1585897049.0,"Thank you for posting this. I fear of getting anxiety attacks every night due to something that isn’t in my control. Well I had one last night like I was afraid of, and ever since then I have felt so incredibly depressed and suicidal. I haven’t ate or showered, I just stayed in my bed and cried and slept. I really hope your post applies to me too. I have been struggling for so long and I’m really scared that one day I might get too overwhelmed with my battles and try to end it."
Anxiety,fmajgim,t3_ftuz8w,1585896223.0,"I am 21f too and also dealing with this. I fear of having anxiety attacks almost every single night, it terrifies me completely and makes me unable to enjoy anything or appreciate life. I get them due to something I can’t change or control (long story) and it just ruins me and makes me want to die. I had a big anxiety attack last night like I was afraid of and I haven’t ate, showered or taken care of myself since then. I always feel depressed and suicidal after I have an attack. That’s how I’m feeling right now. I lost count of how many hours I have cried. I can’t get myself to leave my bed. I want my life back too but I don’t see how I’m going to get it back if I’m going to be dealing with this forever. Although I wouldn’t wish these horrible things on anyone, there is a sense of comfort knowing other people are going through similar things. Maybe we can talk sometime if you’d like? This account I’m using is just a random one I made after I had my attack, I can tell you my main Reddit account if you would like to talk. If not I completely understand."
Anxiety,fmai0u2,t3_ftw1um,1585894810.0,"I deal with this except the only difference is that I stayed at home 24/7 even before this virus started. Nothing in my life has changed since it started since I don’t drive or have a job or any friends. I feel anxious every single day because I’m completely terrified that I will get an anxiety attack when night comes. That’s usually when I get them. I can’t do anything to feel better or stop it. I can’t live my life or do what I want because of the fear, and when I do get the attacks, it completely shuts me down and makes me so depressed and suicidal. I had one last night which really ruined me. And I’m really scared right now of getting it again any moment. 

I really wish I had coping strategies to list here for you, but I am so lost myself when it comes to it that I simply don’t know what advice to give. I guess I’m just here to tell you that someone else here is struggling too. I’m very sorry, we don’t deserve this at all. I hope we will both be okay."
SuicideWatch,fma3bhy,t3_ftzzdh,1585882777.0,"Thanks for posting this. I have spent my entire day sleeping and laying in bed because I had a bad anxiety attack the previous night, and ever since then I have felt extremely depressed and suicidal, because I am so tired of getting attacks over things I can’t control. I try to tell myself it is just my brain overthinking and purposely trying to mess with me but it is so hard to not let scenarios consume you. I can’t live my life or move forward because of it. I have spent the last few hours crying because I am in such emotional pain right now. My family doesn’t even really seem to be concerned or care that I’m suffering. I feel so alone. I can tell I am wearing down my SO and I feel bad for making my problems become his problems, but I just feel so alone in this. I don’t want to be alive anymore if all I’m ever going to deal with is anxiety attacks and the fear of them almost every single night. I can’t do it."
SuicideWatch,fm7owf4,t3_ftly5g,1585833419.0,"I hear you and I see you. I am letting you know that you aren’t alone. Try to contact hotlines again and keep trying until you are able to get ahold of someone. I don’t have any good advice because I am a mess myself. I am currently feeling really suicidal due to things I can’t control. I am just here to let you know that you aren’t alone with how you feel. I really want to die right now but I am forcing myself to stay alive. 

I would like if you stayed alive with me too."
SuicideWatch,fm7l7gr,t1_fm7kybh,1585830583.0,Thank you so much for your words. I’m going to be re-reading them a lot for a while to try to help myself.
Anxiety,fm7kyqo,t3_ft3nko,1585830377.0,I don’t know if I am. I keep getting anxiety attacks at night that I can’t stop or control and it’s making me pause my life because I can’t move forward as long as I keep dealing with them. I’m so tired of being scared of getting one every night. I don’t know if this post includes me.
