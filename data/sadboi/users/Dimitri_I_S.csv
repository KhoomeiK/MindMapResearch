I didn't know he was interviewing multiple people and I assumed that I would get there early and wait for him to arrive. I showed up and took a seat and after the pleasantries he realized I was there early. I turned to see the guy whose interview was before mine standing right behind me. I took a walk and got some tea and came back when the interviewer emailed me that he was ready.

I was also wearing a suit and a tie while the interviewer and the guy in the time slot before me were wearing very casual clothing, which really elevated my 'tryhard' look.

Edit: I wanted to clarify that I wasn't trying to take anyone's spot. I just didn't know there were other people being interviewed. When I walked in, he motioned me over and I sat down, not realizing what was going on."

It is not just 'possible' to take data and use logic to twist it to fit a narrative, it is the very essence of logic. Our cortex is in service to our limbic system. What this means, in layman's terms, is that our emotions govern our beliefs and we just use logic to reaffirm them. Logical reasoning is the ability to convincingly reinforce your emotional biases. If the person in your example had exceptional logical ability, they would most likely be able to construct a very nuanced and well thought out argument for why we live in a matriarchy. Regardless of whether or not it was true."

changemyview,f8u5dt6,t3_e27faz,1574819705.0,"Logical ability, like most things, is on a bell curve. Meaning the higher on the bell curve you are, the fewer people can meet your standards. Naturally, someone with an exceptional capacity for logic, and whose capacity for logic is the standard with which he judges others, is going to feel that most people are incompetent.

Also, I'm pretty sure infinite monkeys typing on typewriters would produce not one, but infinite copies of the complete works of Shakespeare. And it wouldn't be 'eventually', it would be in exactly the shortest amount of time possible for the fastest possible monkey to type the complete works of Shakespeare.
