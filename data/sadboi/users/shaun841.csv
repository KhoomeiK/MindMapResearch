Sourdough,fi655ui,t1_fi64tl0,1582179366.0,"I pretty much followed it directly. One thing I maybe would have done would be another set of stretch and fold but only because my dough still seemed to ‚Äúrun‚Äù a little more than I wanted. What I‚Äôve realized is that you really need to feel/listen to your dough and do what it needs you to do. The basics will always be there but each loaf with require minor tweaking here or there to get your desired outcome. 
I was able to get a 76-78 degree environment in my oven with the light on and door slightly cracked. I think this helped with bulk fermentation.
