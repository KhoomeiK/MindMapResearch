My husband actually suffers from it and wasn’t aware of it although he had only been smoking heavily for 2 months. I know you may not want to, but the best thing to do would be to see your doctor for this."
relationships,fj7pfz8,t3_fawpdv,1583095394.0,My husband and I have gone through some really rough times in the past in our relationship. We’ve gotten through them and our relationship has never been stronger. I am so incredibly happy with how life is going right now and I’m so glad I get to share these moments with my best friend. :)
depression,fdoixlz,t1_fdogzv2,1578606074.0,"My beliefs are pretty up in the air, tbh. I don’t go to church and I don’t really know if a god exists. But in times of extreme stress/hurt I pray??? I completely feel what you’re saying here. I hope to get on medication at some point although I haven’t always had great reactions to them I just REALLY want to feel better. I definitely agree on seeing a therapist as well, have had a very hard time finding one so I’m hoping my new primary will help me find someone within my insurance network. I’m definitely going through a really hard time right now so I will need to find things that I enjoy."

ManchesterNH,f1v2t1k,t1_f1v05yj,1569766390.0,I believe the dog prices vary (I have not purchased a dog through them) but when I was looking to purchase one they were very straightforward and friendly

It says to give it indirect sunlight and keep it well watered, and I do both of these, but it’s continuing to look worse... what can I do? :(  my husband got me this as a gift and I want to prove to him I don’t have a black thumb."
