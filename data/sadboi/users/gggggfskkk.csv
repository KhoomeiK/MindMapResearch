Advice,fr3tpos,t1_fr3qou5,1589865998.0,"The hallucinations aren't so much of my concern. I know the cause and it's because I'm not eating right, I'm malnourished. I'm not eating right because I am unmotivated which is caused by my depression. And my depression is caused by my self pity and putting myself down. Ultimately, the real question is what can I do to stop being so cruel to myself? I put myself down so easily. I have been eating right this week and it's been helping get rid of my hallucinations. I got the motivation to eat right because I talked about it with my boyfriend. Things are changing and some things are going in the right direction. Other things like my self pity is just really getting worse. I need to figure out what I can do to stop beating myself down so much.

Also, I totally understand the overprotective parenting, it drives you crazy sometimes but they're just trying to make sure you are successful. They also fear you growing up. The best thing you can do here is just sit down and talk with them, no arguing but let them see how you feel about this situation. You have many opportunities ahead of you, sometimes you just got to remind them that you'll be okay on your own."

When you talk to someone and really commit and try to understand that person when online is all you got, it really shows so much. We connected immediately, we loved the same types of music, played the same games, and overtime we we became so close, best friends. Because we have built this connection and have committed to talking to each other everyday over the phone, it's unbreakable. The whole relationship is about communication, we can't move forward if we don't talk things through. And especially, you don't judge the person by what they look like or how tall they are or what they do. You actually get to know that person, mentally. You get to know almost everything about them, you know their interests, their hobbies, their habits, their strengths and weaknesses. And honestly, I fell in love with him because I love the way he thinks and his personality, how he tells me how much me loves his family. Honestly, I never had gotten close with anyone in real life, because it's just not the same.
Eventually, yeah, we developed feelings for each other, we still feel everything else that everyone else feels. We just don't get to be there physically.

Lately, I've been having a hard time understanding and I get very easily confused. Like I have no common sense and that always makes me feel bad about myself. That always frustrates and annoys him, as well as, myself. All I have been doing is overthinking, I'm too worried about what I say. I may offend someone or end up confusing them or making them angry. A week ago, I dropped a flower pot, and I just fell apart, shaming myself for what I've done. I feel like everything I do is wrong. And I feel like I've become such a boring person, why? Because I don't do anything anymore that makes me interesting. All I have been doing is crying and the only time I go outside now is to water my plants for the 10 minutes it takes. I used to go outside and go on walks, go on bike rides, but now I just find that so exhausting as if it's a chore. I also tend to expect a lot from people, like I expect them to react a certain way or I expect them to forgive me. I'm having a hard time dealing with myself right now, it just feels so hard. I feel like I'm being ridiculous and I hate myself because of that. I just make it too much about me. I sometimes feel like I am someone who people are just putting up with to please me. I just feel like I've ruined everything. It makes sense why all my past friends have left me because they're just so sick of my crap. One of the quotes that we made was, ""one really great friend is much better than 100 fake friends."" And I still believe that - I much rather have a one really great friend who understands, cares, loves, appreciates me than 100 fake friends who could care less about me. It just makes me feel like he would be much happier with 100 fake friends than having to deal with me. I don't think I am that great of a friend, I have a very hard time believing that. I feel like all I do is disappoint people. Should I stop caring?! Growing up I wasn't ever a supportive person, when I saw someone crying, I didn't know what to do, I would just freeze up until someone else swooped in to rescue. I just did nothing, and I still struggle with that because I don't know how to comfort someone or be supportive at all. It's not just that but I feel like I've been a horrible sister, I hardly even know her. She is pretty much a stranger to me since we are 13 years apart, we didn't really grow up together. But I feel like I should know her and it saddens me to think maybe she just doesn't care about me. I've called her a few times before but it was always me reaching out to her so I gave up. I feel like she just doesn't care and that has ruined me a bit too. I feel like almost all my relationships are ruined between family and friends because I expect so much from them in return. Okay, I should probably not leave you so much to read or you may not even want to help me, lol. I'm sorry for so many words, but this helped me, like you said destress a little bit. Thank you, it really does make me feel better when you say that you care, that means a lot to me."

Advice,foosfbk,t1_fomndp2,1587945481.0,"Ask \*her\* questions about horseback riding, don't figure things out on your own. If she likes talking about it I'm sure she would love to tell you all about it. If you don't want to hear about horseback riding, I'm sure she has other hobbies that she enjoys. I'd probably just ask her a lot of questions to show your curiosity."
