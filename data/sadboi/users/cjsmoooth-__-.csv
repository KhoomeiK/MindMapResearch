Supernatural,fr4n22a,t3_gmltyt,1589892577.0,"It was a pin on pinterest, and it makes total sense that he would be wearing one for those reasons due to the fact that he is supportive of people in those categories. 

I don't use Facebook 

But I have tweeted misha regarding this photo and if I get a response that him wearing a safety pin has nothing to do with the movement I will gladly delete this.

Or maybe I will just delete it now. And repost it if I get an answer regarding this being true."
wholesomememes,fr4le2m,t1_fr4khdz,1589891410.0,"I love everyone (:
The meaning behind the whole safety pin thing is just directed towards people who fall into different categories. 
But I posted it because I still think it's considered wholesome.
And if you look through this sub, not every post is directed at every single demographic or group of people, so I felt okay with posting it."
wholesomememes,fr4l182,t1_fr4kgog,1589891147.0,I find it extremely frustrating as well. I have a lot of feelings about the treatment of white men and women not being able to be proud without being considered racist or a white supremacist.
