Sometimes I just get scared, but if I'm close to the situation I get angry. I don't do anything, I just keep the anger to myself.

Anxiety,fkuugzn,t1_fkubpjv,1584556358.0,"I mean, honestly, I'm fine most of the time. Like, it's probably still there, but it's not as noticable. Whenever I do feel it, though, I tend to do something that will distract me, like reading or watching something. That helps a little bit, but not when there are things I have to do. My anxiety has increased in the last year, I think due to my situation with my mom and that I'm seeing a psychologist to help me face those problems. It's also the last year before graduation, so that also makes it worse. But I guess it kind of has to get worse to get better, you know? At least I'm trying to get better, although many times I just don't want to. I think it's really important to find something that can make you relax, and also keep in mind your goal whatever it is. If the goal seems unreachable, make a ""sub goal"" that seems reachable, just kind of take it step by step. If you try to do things you're not comfortable with because of anxiety, say like talking to people, you're taking a step to get better. I'm still struggling myself, so how exactly to deal with it, I don't know, but this is what I think. Find something relaxing, small goals, take things step by step, do things that you're anxious about (in your pace of course)."

Wanting to try and share some of my ideas or opinions, but not being able to because it feels like my brain and voice is working against me. Being really tired. Constant worrying, even though I don't really even have any thoughts. Like, I had a test on Monday, from home, and I was really tired on Sunday, for what I suspect might just be that test, even though I didn't really think too much about it. Also when I was at my brothers and we talked about or childhood and stuff (growing up with a sick mom which I think cause most of my mental problems), it was fine, it was nice, but a whole week after that I was dead tired. I don't always notice how much things affect me because it happens subconsciously or something. What do I think? I used to have a problem with that question, but it's better now, if I don't have a certain thought I just kind of think of what I felt. I have more problems with questions like ""how does tha make you feel?"" If I don't have a direct reference, it's hard to tell. Sometimes it's hard to tell even if I have a reference."

Don't know if it's the same for all martial arts, but that's what we did. So it's starts pretty calmly. I wasn't that unfit back then, so I learned pretty easily. I'm quite unfit now though, and I'm going to start going to a martial arts school. I think, if they say it's for all levels then it will be fine. Obviously, things can happen, but if you tried, at least you tried. Even though I stopped going because I was scared I didn't do well, I still enjoyed it, and look back at it fondly. This comment is probably a bit messy, but I think if you can bring yourself to go, just once, and try it, you can at least tell yourself you did it. When you're scared, take it one step at a time.

I get it, but still, you're responsible for your own happiness, right? I don't think she does any of this consciously, but it feels like I'm the one who's supposed to make her feel better all the time. Since we were young, me and my siblings had every other Christmas with each parent. This year I was supposed to be with my dad, but my mom sent both me and my dad pretty much the same message, she told me ""Hey. I asked your dad if we could switch, so you kids are at my place this Christmas. It's fits better like that. **My brother** says there's no space for him there, so he'd get to celebrate Christmas with all his siblings. My husband's kids have to stay with their mother in odd numbered years, so one Christmas we're here and there and the other were alone."". Now, we're all above the age of 18, so technically we're adults. It'd be sort of fine if she just asked me, but she asked dad too, as if he was going to talk to me, maybe convince me to go to mom? Before, mom would also often complain about dad to me, how he never spent any money on me to buy things I needed, although I'm pretty sure he did use some money on me, just didn't have the time to shop that much. Sorry about the rant"
Anxiety,fcark19,t1_fca1efe,1577575226.0,"Man, this is really relatable. This was me last year. I literally kept saying to myself ""If not for me, then live for everyone else"". I had given up trying to be happy and just tried to make life better for everyone else. Not very succesful I must say as I mostly kept to myself and my step mom also said I looked like I had a shield around me saing ""F off"".  I would feel emotion, but now much. I mostly just felt tired, numb. I guess you could say, I felt depressed. I used to question whether I actually had depression or if this was just how life was. I don't feel depressed anymore, but do have social anxiety. But I also question the severity of that all the time. If there is a second I'm not feeling it: ""Do I really have anxiety? Am I blowing it out of proportion?"" But then, the teacher would say the dreaded word ""groups"" and there we go. To afraid to say anything. Or I'll be walking in the halls, and someone brushes against me and I just kind of shrivel up like a raisin. Or I need to stay home because school enviroments tire me out and I get a notice about having missed a lot of classes: ANXIETY ATTACK! Great... I'm a lot better, but, yeah... To me, opening up to people I know care about me, and telling myself that I matter, has helped a lot. Also, I would love to read some of your writing, it sounds very interesting."
Anxiety,fcaodaa,t3_egslip,1577573294.0,"Yes! I used to not care about anything and struggled with my emotions. Some times I would blow up the little emotion I felt just so I wouldn't seem ungrateful for a gift for example. Some times I would act on an emotion I didn't realize I had. For example I could say I was happy for something and instantly ask myself ""am I?"" becasue I couldn't feel it. Whenever somebody asked me what I wanted, I wouldn't know and/or care. It's werid, because it was also like that with other things, I couldn't tell whether I was hungry or not. I still feel a little like this, but it's gotten a lot better and I was excited for christmas this year! I think removing some toxic people from my life, starting therapy and just talk about my experiences helped. After starting therapy, I went there thinking I'm supposed to tell her things that bother me and that that isn't a bother to her because that is what therapy is for. In other words, she wouldn't like it if I didn't. It helped me open up to talk about my problems, not only to her, but my step mom whom I'm really close to. I think just knowing my problems and my feelings mattered helped. I also think trying to stop hiding from them also made them come back. I am allowed to feel and have opinions, just like everyone else."

Anxiety,fc6jrsv,t3_ege8au,1577482247.0,"I used to feel this a lot back at my old school where I'd hear my classmates talk about things they did. They all seemed to always be doing something together, but I didn't, so I always felt left out. I wondered if they chose not to ask me to join, or if they just didn't think about it. Even now with my family I get super upset if they even eat breakfast together without me because they didn't want to wake me, I just want them to wake me up and ask anyway, regardless of what I want. I always wonder when my step sister, a.k.a. my best friend, is with her other friends, if she misses me, or needs me. I'm always scared that some day she'll stop hanging out with me because she has other friends to hang out with. Basically, I feel like I'm the kind of I-don't-have-anyone-better kind of friend."
