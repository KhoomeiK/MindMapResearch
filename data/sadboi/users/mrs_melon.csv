Advice,fqvka7s,t1_fqvk4yp,1589679089.0,"i’m sorry but i think you kind of know what to do. go ahead and talk to her, don’t argue. explain why you’re upset. talking is the best way to get something through to another person. don’t be hateful or rude or argue, explain yourself and show your concern for your relationship."
Advice,fqvh1qz,t1_fqvgucs,1589677101.0,"talk to your girlfriend and explain that you’re upset. if she doesn’t care and isn’t worried, you shouldn’t be either. 
i was that person that wanted everyone who flirted with my boyfriend blocked and it didn’t last long. i was too restricting. 
if your girlfriend is flirting back, that’s a problem. if she ignores it or isn’t bothered, then you should be safe."

BipolarReddit,folfeq0,t3_g84jy4,1587861060.0,"My mom has BP1 and I just learned I have BP2. My biggest advice is be easy with them. 

Growing up, I never knew why my mom was so upset and mad all the time. I always thought it was because of me. She didn’t let me know until I was 17 and I wish she told me sooner. It’s definitely grown my relationship with her and I’m glad she told me

I would say let them know about what you’re going through when you feel that you’re ready. It might be confusing to them but they’ll learn to understand. If you get mad, apologize for being mad. 

If you’re children are young, you can simply say “I’m sorry, mommy/daddy sometimes gets upset very quick. It’s not your fault.”

Also, I suggest looking into some support groups especially through Facebook. I’ve gotten a lot of help through BiPolar groups there."
Advice,fo1bi9c,t1_fo1bf3j,1587429708.0,for sure. there’s nothing saying you *have* to show your face. you can simply say you wouldn’t like to and you should be fine :)
Advice,fo1arec,t1_fo1acgx,1587429260.0,my college professor doesn’t have a webcam for our Zoom classes. OP could just say they don’t want to show their face too. I’m sure it’s not a requirement

mentalhealth,fo15mkd,t3_g53zcf,1587426232.0,Zoloft made me super tired and psychically sick. They advised me to take it before bed to help me sleep but I could never sleep due to it making me sick :/ One of the side effects is nausea that’s typically during the first two weeks. For me it was all the time and it felt like my stomach was being torn up. They said it was super rare for me to feel that way but now I’m on something different.

he’s just dragging you down and not letting you live to the fullest. once you leave him you’ll be happy. it’ll be hard, but in the long run you’ll be happy."

mentalhealth,fnhep3f,t1_fnhejlv,1586960972.0,its totally understandable. i had a hard time just reaching out for help. another thing you can do is ask if you can send an email and then type the email to her.
service_dogs,fnfe2af,t1_fnfd8sd,1586906293.0,"I will be living completely by myself. I go to college a few hours away. I said here because I’m currently in their hausse to to the virus, sorry for the confusion. 

Im not asking them for permission. My DR wants me to tell my parents as a way to just give them a heads up and let them know. I haven’t told my family about my mental health status and it’s really hard to because “if there’s something wrong then you need to be taken care of properly”. Last time i came clean about my s*icide attempt, I was threatened to be sent away. She wants me to let them know what is going to happen and I’m more scared of the reaction than anything. 

Second, I’m asking about an ESA, not a service dog. Yes they are both costly, but I am aware of how much an ESA will cost me in the long run."

Thank you for the advice! I feel like puppies will also increase my anxiety instead of help decrease it."
service_dogs,fnfa6z8,t1_fnf9i4v,1586904257.0,"•I do have a letter currently. My Psychiatrist just wants me to bring it up to my parents. 
•Yes i have had tons of experience. I used to work at an animal shelter and train dogs. 
•I currently work on the college campus in between some classes. my general income is $500 every two weeks. 

I’ve thought about this a lot and we currently have a dog at home. She’s really old and we know it’s almost her time to go. I’m comfortable around dogs but I am mostly scared of them thinking i “just want another dog”. I will be moving into my own place this year (with out roommates) and I don’t do well by myself. My Psychiatrist believes having a ESA will bring me a sense of security and allow me to always have someone to go to."
mentalhealth,fnf2gut,t3_g1axvi,1586900189.0,there is nothing more reliable than asking your therapist or calling a psychiatrist. tests on the internet are generalized and are not correct. i would say call your therapist and they will understand.
