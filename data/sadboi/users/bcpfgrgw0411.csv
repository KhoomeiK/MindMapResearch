Your parents concern for him remembering his birthday party fondly is sweet too. They shouldn‚Äôt be telling you that you were to harsh, but I understand why they think this way.

My dad was super present in my childhood and now, in my twenties, I have a fabulous relationship with them both because of how well they coparented. 

Your husband needs to be accountable to his children. Not only does his inaction affect you and your wellbeing, it will affect how his/your children remember their childhood and their relationships with each of you later on. You absolutely deserve to sleep in and he absolutely needs to step up.

I‚Äôm going with YTA but for one simple reason. Your teacher had struggled with finding this patients pulse as well, but did not state an obvious fact in such a rude way. Your teacher struggled with a patient, and watched you struggle as well, but then listened to you unkindly blame a patient for your own inability to find a pulse. The patient, despite an obvious health risk that comes with obesity (I‚Äôm overweight too, so I‚Äôm not fat shaming) does not need to be shamed. A huge reason why my health is actually on an upswing is because my current doctors have kindly (and in a straightforward way) given me actually useful tips to benefit my health. Although I have never been anywhere near as obese as the patient you‚Äôve described, the kindness and compassion that came from medical professionals helped me feel more confident in my choice to be healthier. Although it is not rude to explicitly point out someone‚Äôs figure in a medical sense, there is likely a reason that patient is that size. It is not your place to judge are make statements. It is simply your place to learn how to care for a patient of that size. Your comment, had it been directed at me, and had I overheard it, definitely would have made me feel shame and would not have brought me any closer to a healthier and easier-to-treat weight.

While it might have sucked that you had a disadvantage to other classmates because they had their tests with classmates who were in better health, and therefor easier to read, if you had practiced at all for this exam then you should have known that you could potentially be paired with ‚ÄúPatty‚Äù. Therefor, you should have practiced taking the vitals of other obese people. You did not have any disadvantages because you likely knew this test was coming up and how it would be given. You should have known to study/practice more."

KitchenConfidential,ffjojfn,t1_ffjl7fh,1580003042.0,"Honestly I totally get it - that first job I had sent me home crying every night because working with that chef gave me such crippling depression and anxiety. He was the epitome of toxic masculinity and I couldn‚Äôt take it any more. 

That being said, my current boss is a bit of a nutcase too but I‚Äôve sort of just gotten used to rolling with the punches. For example, my current boss wrote me up for multiple counts of inappropriate touching 2 weeks ago despite the fact that the most intimate I am with any coworker (minus one who specifically initiates hugs with me) is a tap on the shoulder when I am saying behind (I am a little overweight and my body takes up space. If they aren‚Äôt paying attention to my words, taps on the back are the only other warning I can give). I never tap or hug managers. But somehow, in a bout of anger, my boss got mad enough to start giving out write ups for not real reasons. He also yelled at me for being early. And for talking to a hostess at her station. 

This all really bugged me and trigged a bout of my anxiety, but all of that aside, if it were me last year, I would have quit because of how isolated I would have felt. This year, I learned how to listen when there is a real problem I need to fix (keeping a tidier station, speaking louder if my queues are not heard, etc) and learning to let go of problems that are the chefs (him yelling about me being early or getting written up for things I didn‚Äôt do). Last year when I quit that first job, it was in part due to a huge amount of isolation that that chef gave me. He singled me out and made me work alone when he realized the sous chefs tried helping me. 

This chef I work for now goes on little power trips and then calms down.  I just know when to avoid him now."
KitchenConfidential,ffjkj75,t3_etzdnr,1580000324.0,"I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND 

I am just over a year out of school (specifically for baking) and I‚Äôve had to change jobs a 3 times because of such toxic people - until I learned that toxic behaviors exist in every work environment. 

I suggest you don‚Äôt follow what I did and quit every few months because things suck - although sometimes it is the only option. 

My biggest piece of advice is to find an ally. My first job out of school had the worst chef I have met, even with all of my job changes (I‚Äôm a woman too, and this chef was a tall, vaguely racist [I‚Äôm white and so was he but I cannot stand any sense of inequality so this made the dude even more intolerable], definitely misogynistic man - definitely intimidating to me).  However, I found solace in the fact that the two sous chefs defended me mercilessly and spent every moment they could spare furthering my education they agreed that the head chef was truly terrible and I still keep in touch with one of those sous‚Äôs, even after quitting. Having someone who will defend your honor and make your education - even post school - a priority is invaluable. This isn‚Äôt to say that they‚Äôll never snap at you, but finding someone who has been in that kitchen or in the industry itself for a while is useful. 

The kitchen I‚Äôm currently in is kind of a disaster as well, but since I‚Äôve gained a few allies, any time a hiccup happens, I know I will still have people in my corner. It helps.

Your child feels more comfortable with an object near her and it‚Äôs only your nature as a parent to try to provide comfort as a parent. 

However, your other children have a slightly depressing point - your daughter who is on the spectrum is unfortunately at an age where people may not always be the most supportive or understanding. Even strangers who are adults and should know better tend to pass judgments. She losing her from those people makes sense too - and your other children may see your tiny splurge on the toys as unfair treatment. 

That being said I do think you did the right thing by having a few backups. But your daughter is truly the one who gets to have the most say as it affects her directly. It‚Äôs her comfort object and her life. Your other children need to learn to be more open minded and get their own gas money, but they aren‚Äôt wrong for being children still and seeing what you did as favoritism - even if it wasn‚Äôt. 

My siblings and I are all adults but when we gather for holidays, we still act like little kids and bicker the same way as when we were younger and see our parents playing favorites in different ways even when they aren‚Äôt.

AskReddit,fd6tsut,t3_ejxtkl,1578195617.0,"I have a few reasons but it all started with the fact that when I was in high school, a very close relative of mine lost her baby and I was absolutely devastated by it (not to turn her loss into my own, I know it was a million times worse for her, but we are very close and I took it hard). Almost a year later, a kid from my high school passed away from cancer and I went to his wake. I was not prepared to see his corpse in the slightest but there it was. Those two events happening a year apart from each other when I was still a teen made me deeply hate the existence of children and the fact that the could die just as easily as any adult. I‚Äôve lost lots of people in my life but seeing two minors (a baby and a teen) gave me a severe phobia of parenting as the idea of outliving a child would push me into a worse depression.

Aside from that, I also have a deep disgust with the concept of giving birth and would never truly forgive any child for putting me through pregnancy. It‚Äôs a borderline dysphoria. There is nothing that makes me feel more betrayed by my cis gender female body than the fact that I can birth children. But due to my age and country, most doctors won‚Äôt allow me to have a hysterectomy for many years. But the concept of pregnancy and birth truly makes me depressed and borderline suicidal. 

Also I simply do not like younger children. I do not have the interest in pampering and coddling or the patience to wipe the shit and tears away. 

All of that being said, I will not ever be cruel or mean to a child. They don‚Äôt know why I don‚Äôt like them and don‚Äôt deserve my own cynicism just because the exist. I‚Äôll always be kind to the kids I encounter, but I will never have my own."

KitchenConfidential,fcz7g4v,t1_fcxd6e2,1578095203.0,Oh my goodness... this actually helped me put this situation in a new perspective that my attitude could 100% be part of the issue. Thank you for sharing that!
KitchenConfidential,fcvnki7,t1_fcvdvkz,1578005955.0,This is excellent advice! Thank you so much. I‚Äôll definitely try all of this!

KitchenConfidential,fcvndgb,t1_fcv8xru,1578005832.0,The funny thing is is that he IS a bit of a clean freak... I‚Äôm surprised he doesn‚Äôt care more... he gets mad when I organize things differently than him but he seems less bothered by the actual messes that other people leave
KitchenConfidential,fcv2zsp,t1_fcuz7a9,1577993583.0,"Thank you! You‚Äôre probably right... I know that they aren‚Äôt leaving a mess to make my day worse, it really probably is because they are busy.... that‚Äôs a good perspective to keep!"
AmItheAsshole,fc6pe63,t3_egdo8l,1577486132.0,"NAH - I think you are definitely in the right and it sounds like your child is closer to your husband rather than her bio dad. That being said, I understand your ex‚Äôs hurt but it is in no way your fault. Your daughter has a good relationship with your husband and that‚Äôs good!! Even if he isn‚Äôt as present as your husband, I can imagine that might sting for your ex to hear. I‚Äôm sorry he blew up at you though."
MentalHealthSupport,fc5wlb3,t1_fc4guhd,1577467430.0,"So sorry! Anxiety swears suck.... hopefully cracking a window can help next time this happens... let‚Äôs face it, there‚Äôs always a next time üòû I completely relate"
AmItheAsshole,fc47sh6,t3_eg19n8,1577408928.0,"Gonna go with NTA. If you tell them the truth, it will be easier for them to sort out their feelings about it rather than hearing about it from someone else (like a chatty neighbor or gossipy cousin or the likes). When I was 13 (so right between your kids ages) my parents tried to hide some vital information about the passing of a family friend (yes I know that dying is different than divorce) but finding out second hand rather than from my family was awful. If you make sure they know that none of this is their fault and even try to show some compassion for your soon-to-be-ex (yes, cheating is awful, and not at all ok, but learning to be civil with those who have wronged you is a good thing), your kids will learn to be stronger and healthier teens and adults for it. Having a good role model for how to deal with those who have hurt you can reach your kids how to cope with pain later on."

AmItheAsshole,f9w4gt8,t3_e719i4,1575686848.0,"Gonna say NAH largely because your obvious deep concern for your friends loss is apparent. 

My closest cousin lost her baby unexpectedly some years ago and her friends who had infants around that time did everything in their power to make my cousin feel loved and cared for. But they also shared the concern of rubbing their live children in her face so they came over without their children for short snippets of time so as not to overwhelm my cousin. It really seemed to help. 

So while I don‚Äôt think you you should bring your infant, I also definitely understand the breastfeeding issue. Perhaps have your husband drive with you and your baby but have your husband and your baby go to a local park near by? That way, he can message you if your baby needs to be fed and you can quietly exit and feed your child? Staying briefly to help your friend mourn this tragedy is important and bringing your child would be insensitive but I am certain there is a way you and your husband can figure out a solution to accommodate your friends feelings. It‚Äôs great that you guys tag team your parenting styles! So sorry for your friends loss.

Edit: typos and adding additional thoughts"
MentalHealthSupport,f9skr64,t1_f9sg6ap,1575594296.0,"Thank you! This really means so much!

And yeah, I‚Äôm completely with you... holistic care can absolutely help! Goodness knows lavender oil has helped me in a pinch and deep breathing can help too! But starting these meds has given me a sense of hope that I haven‚Äôt had in years. 

I honestly don‚Äôt believe my friend meant to be as cruel as she came off. She cleared herself up a bit - her concern was more directed at the over prescription of opioids and adhd pills I suppose. But the way she worded herself was clearly because she hadn‚Äôt done a lot of research on the topic of antidepressants so it still stings a bit. I‚Äôm hoping knowing that I‚Äôm on meds makes her a little more aware!

Again thank you for your kind words. I‚Äôm glad to hear you‚Äôve seemed to have found a good balance for you! This gives me a lot of hope for myself."
MentalHealthSupport,f9s9k2u,t1_f9s7cmy,1575588089.0,Absolutely! Taking medication is totally personal and whatever choice made should be supported!

KitchenConfidential,f96vwwb,t1_f92luvu,1575153298.0,"I definitely think better pay would be nice but I just felt so sad because I also kind of chose to come early. I was only scheduled for a 10 hour shift and I chose to come in early and stay a bit late because I love this job so far. Like I‚Äôm working my butt off and because I chose to, not because my chef or management guilted me to. And that guy called out because he was mad about pay (which I get) but I later found out that he didn‚Äôt get a pay bump because he walked out before and my chef was giving him a second chance by retiring him."
KitchenConfidential,f96vhfi,t1_f92ljgs,1575153009.0,Thanks! I started bringing a huge tumbler to work and forcing myself to refill it when it gets emptied.... it‚Äôs definitely forced me to get better at rehydrating at work! Thanks for the advice!!
