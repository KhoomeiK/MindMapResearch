AskWomenOver30,fnf4vze,t3_g1bb95,1586901451.0,"I understand that feeling of it being hard to be around pregnant colleagues/new moms. I have an 'invisible' health condition that means I might never have kids. 

If you are looking for ideas for hobbies/activities, I can suggest trying community theatre. It's a creative outlet, a way of connecting with people of all ages, and gives a great sense of purpose/bonding as you work together to put on a show. It can be a big time commitment but maybe that's what you need. Theatre can be super rewarding because there is an end product and validation from the audience as well as the people you worked with. There are lots of different roles as well, if you're not comfortable acting (although I recommend trying to out. It can be wonderful to be someone else for a few hours a week). Stage hands, costume design and sewing, set design and construction, light operator...
Theatre is place where I have found a made family and it is proven to have emotional wellbeing benefits."
halifax,ffyhvdq,t3_evqbtk,1580346799.0,I love this. Super interesting.
FancyFollicles,ff0sm1i,t3_er0eu1,1579471916.0,Totally beautiful! Something about the colour and length is magnetic.
firstnations,fcg088e,t3_eh1cvi,1577635319.0,Beautiful and powerful
NovaScotia,fbc7fd8,t1_fbbp2tp,1576717467.0,"I can only tell you what happened to me. There was only one phone that was available for free, you could upgrade to others for a fee. My bill is the same, I signed no contract. * shrugs *"
NovaScotia,fbat644,t3_ecdu9e,1576686224.0,"I got the same notice and did the upgrade. My phone was going on six years old. I was a little pissed but when I went into the store, the new phone was completely free and I didn't have to sign a new contract. So I don't think it's scam?"
BipolarReddit,f86122u,t3_dz622j,1574287563.0,"For me, I can become emotionally distant from my husband when I am going through an episode and it is because I want to protect him. I don't want to expose him to my feelings of misery, worthlessness, etc. I feel I should power through it on my own and not ""be a burden."" So I default to ""I'm fine but leave me alone"". It's really hard on him I know because he feels disconnected and doesn't know what's going on. So he starts worrying he's done something etc. It's something I'm working on in therapy and we're both trying to get better at communicating."
mentalhealth,f6xwop5,t3_dtmqje,1573260729.0,Happy Birthday! You're inspiring not pitiful. You've been through so much - you've already proved to yourself you can hold on. Take care.
halifax,f52b56a,t1_f4q6pof,1571948848.0,This is really cool and definitely not something I came across in any of my own googling. I will be checking to see if they have shows on the go when we're there. Thanks!
BipolarReddit,f4xzqe6,t3_dm21jp,1571870751.0,"I also have vivid and exhausting dreams. I think the lamotrigine makes it worse, but I remember having crazy dreams for most of my life including sleep paralysis. I've heard other people with mental illness talk about it too. I get a lot of anxiety dreams -- for example I had one recently that I got called in for an unexpected shift so I'm rushing around and can't find my uniform and then I pull it out of a drawer and it's all faded and moth-eaten. Like fuck off brain, I have enough to deal with when I'm awake. Another stupid recurring one is I'm shopping for something and I'm on a timeline but I can't find the thing. Or I find it but I can't choose between two products and then I can't find the check-out... and it just goes on and on until I wake up. I also have more typical nightmares of being chased, a mass shooting, someone's in my house coming for me etc. I don't have a lot of help to offer other than having a podcast or goofy TV show you can click on after you wake up to sooth you and get the images out of your head."
halifax,f4od019,t1_f4o9hb9,1571699699.0,This exactly the kind of thing I was hoping for! Something kinda trendy we don't have in our small town but does not involve booze lol. Thanks a bunch.
halifax,f4nzdb0,t1_f4nt3st,1571694581.0,That sounds awesome! Thank you for the suggestion.
BipolarReddit,f1nltcd,t1_f1lx7ge,1569620150.0,Glad to know I'm not alone in endlessly rewatching things. I have certain go-to comfort shows and movies. I also like the fake exercise idea.
femalefashionadvice,f19z06f,t1_f178nlm,1569281545.0,Very close to my family tartan. Never would have thought this would be on trend post-1800's.
femalefashionadvice,f15ajbd,t3_d7ttn2,1569187043.0,"There is such a thing as ""dress shields"" made specifically for this purpose. A better alternative than pads! I've only used them when doing theatre but they do work. If you need/want to wear a certain colour or fancier fabric like silk, it's something good to have on hand. I've found the Secret clinical strength does work for me where other brands like Dove did nothing. You put it on at night. I also agree with another commenter about avoiding certain synthetic fabrics. Cotton/blends are the way to go."
BipolarReddit,ewh50a4,t1_ewh1zcz,1565398019.0,"Just want to say your post about happy years, relationship, and pregnancies gave me a bit of hope and boost when I've been feeling really down. Thanks."
BipolarReddit,eot6cwa,t3_bsyefe,1558835756.0,I don't know but I recommend talking to a pharmacist if your Dr is being unhelpful. They will take you seriously generally about side effects and print studies you can then take to your doctor if they can find a connection.
BipolarReddit,eo6afct,t3_bqis7p,1558315377.0,"I just want to say it can still come back to you. I realized I'd emerged from a 2- year depression+mixed-state episode when I looked at some trees and thought ""Hey, trees are beautiful"". It had been so long since I'd been able to see that it was a totally radical moment. I use it now as a grounding thing when I'm in a bad place. I remind myself to look at the trees and if I can still ""see"" them, then I know things will be ok. Try to hang in."
