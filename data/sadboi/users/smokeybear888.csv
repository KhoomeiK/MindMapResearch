I’ve been w/ him a long time & he knows my conditions well.  Terribly depressed, I was more than willing to try it.  Within 4 days, I had the *best* response to a medication prescribed, for me, as an antidepressant ever.  I was beyond excited!  But within 2 weeks, it just all “bled out.”  That’s how it felt...all that energy, clearheadedness, motivation just draining away.

When things were changing, I asked him if I cld up the dose.  Response was to go up to 50 & to 75mg if I felt like I needed to.  I quickly discovered how sedating it was.  At 25mg, I slept better than I had in ages!  But the 50, then 75?  Forget it!  I was exhausted, slow & groggy.  Even w/ a daily nap, I cldn’t handle the fatigue.  

I dropped bk dwn to the 25 & it’s been about 3 wks now.  Don’t want to jinx anything but I kind of feel like my body & brain have found a ...

ASLinterpreters,fmdppgt,t3_fu6jzw,1585974219.0,"If you’re too challenged w/ your hearing issues but fluent in ASL, you could do your interpreter training to become a CDI~certified Deaf interpreter. I was an interpreter for 30 years and worked w/ profoundly Deaf interpreters as teams not often but plenty of times.  It requires some extra skill for the “hearing” interpreter in the team and it has to be really challenging for the Deaf interpreter but I’ve worked w/  highly skilled ones.  And the perspective of a hearing impaired/D/deaf person always trying to work up to the level of a hearing interpreter is honestly a thought that never crossed my mind.  In fact, quite the opposite.  The D/deaf person has an advantage often times of ASL being their 1st language.  And believe me, that trumps a hearing interpreters skill any day.  CODA’s are close in skill ... children of D/deaf adults.  So don’t cut yourself short!  Go for it."
