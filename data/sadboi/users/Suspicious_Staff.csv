BPD,fjtqvwa,t3_fbu5jp,1583610185.0,I‚Äôm so glad (and sad) that other people experience this too with BPD. It‚Äôs like I get a small obsession with a person even as you say a celeb that have never even met! Mine is Pete Davidson right now who also has BPD - go figure lol üò©
BPD,fjhlbfi,t3_fda1fr,1583350334.0,I do this too - sometimes look in mirror and like the way I look and feel confident then other days can‚Äôt even go outside without being so self conscious and anxious that people are looking at me and hate the way I look and will pick myself apart even plan all the surgeries I want to have to my face when I finally win the lottery lol (it‚Äôs not funny but got to try keep our sense of humour through it all üò©). This illness sucks.
shrooms,fjajs7a,t1_fjaj055,1583174910.0,"Ah so you took a lot less than me then as I took 1 gram I think - well that‚Äôs what it says on their website that they are pre-packed into 1 gram ready to eat pod things. It says this on their website:

‚Äú6 microdoses of 1 gram Psilocybin truffles, on a strip.
this will not bring you into a deep psychedelic trip, but will enhance creativity & mood. 
your senses will be rebooted
we recommend to use 1 gram every 3rd day, before noon. 
taking it more often will give less results.‚Äù

Maybe I should get some scales and measure myself and take less instead of the 1 gram as I am looking for the same feeling you described! 

Sorry if I sound silly (new to mushroom world lol) but do you know if mushrooms and truffles are different as noticed it actually is Psilocybin truffles I am microdosing from the site?"
