As long as it‚Äôs not ‚Äúhmm I saw a Deaf person called Keith and his name sign is a K handshape in the crook of his elbow... I will steal this person‚Äôs name sign and bastardized the cultural importance of it and give this name sign to my dog‚Äù.

I call my cat Baba, when I raised him I was very oral and he learned his name. Then I started fingerspelling it as I called to him, making sure he could tell what I was getting at, and the movement of signing ‚Äúb-a-b-a‚Äù very quickly is more of a weirdly specific waving motion anyway, so I guess that is my cat‚Äôs ‚Äúnamesign‚Äù, I just spell his name in my own lexicalized way (quickly like a wave) but I do also vocally call out for him - the two of us have been together a long time üòÅ"
