mentalhealth,folqh40,t1_folqcp2,1587868085.0,Yea! I’m really happy I finally found out the reason because all the other reasons i thought of never really clicked. But thank you so much!
mentalhealth,folpw8x,t1_folps45,1587867697.0,"Thank you, you as well!"
mentalhealth,folptjd,t1_folphya,1587867646.0,"I understand why you hate that food so much. It’s how i feel about the activity that gives me anxiety. When i was younger I did track and it gave me the same reaction, probably because of my past. I quit track and i refuse to run for leisure and i refuse to go to the place where my track practices were. i still get a little anxiety when people talk about it, but i’m mostly healed from that."
mentalhealth,folow8l,t1_foloqy3,1587867035.0,"I think i realize what it is. in a way the topic reminds me of my past which did a lot of my mental health. when i was involved with the topic, it made me feel like i was in my past again."
mentalhealth,foloijd,t1_folny79,1587866784.0,"honestly, i think the reason is because the so many of the people who are associated with this topic (it’s an activity), were very hurtful to me and made me feel inferior and put me under insane amounts of pressure. i think in a way, it reminds me of my past when i was extremely suicidal and self deprecating, and i think it might just be a reaction to it in a way. thank you so much for the help :)"
mentalhealth,folo8mf,t1_folnpde,1587866602.0,"thank you so much, i really appreciate it. some people think it’s dumb that this thing hurts me so much, but you give some really good advice. thank you, and i hope you stay strong and keep on your path to a more normal life :)"
