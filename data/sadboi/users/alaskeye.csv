You deserve to be treated just right and avoiding conflict is considering that others are more important than you, your needs and your emotions. You‚Äôre equal and letting people know your boundaries will strengthen true relationships. Maybe some people will be lost in the process, and you will have to rethink the relationship you have. A lot of people react normally to conflict. People who react badly and create a scene is not your fault, and you have the power to stand for yourself every second : you can‚Äôt control others emotions but you can learn to tame yours (not really, you can exerce an influence but you‚Äôre not responsible). You can react differently and it will turn okay 95% of the time. As much as its became a habit to turn down your true needs and freedom to speak, it becomes one to express yourself adequately and to learn to treat yourself as an equally important person than anybody else.

Coronavirus,fmvaese,t3_fxagx0,1586410550.0,"Yeah. I‚Äôm from Marseille, where Pr Raoult works. It is very helpful to us, we are not highly touched by the virus and an enormous number of death have been avoided thanks to hydroxychloroquine and azymotrycine. It doesn‚Äôt work if the person is already in respiratory distress. It works well in the beginning of the disease to prevent developing complications and France is now understanding the importance of having options to help treat this disease. This is not a cure. This is crisis medicine and the Pr did a great work to make this treatment accessible because it helps not having too many people in intensive care at once üëç In Marseille the disease is progressing very slowly. I still work, at a private hospital, and we are luckily not very affected and had time for collecting furnitures masks and everything. 
Take care everyone"
IWantToLearn,fhrw09o,t3_f4ci3p,1581841340.0,"I had a very bad posture for years and since doing yoga almost everyday it forced me to straighten my back and my neck, My posture is naturally better and I have no back pain anymore."
dpdr,fejaxja,t1_feivvi2,1579164807.0,"I strongly invite you to practice yoga (that includes meditation and breathing techniques) as it will forces you to connect and to focus on your body. It is an excellent tool for all types anxiety IMO (I‚Äôm a neuropsychologist). You‚Äôre right, focusing on what is happening in your brain non stop is what preventing your thoughts to flow normally. It‚Äôs a part of the disorder tho but it fade with being confident in ourself. Good luck take care"
BPD,f3hgisp,t3_dgx53a,1570923359.0,"Hi, I suggest you to talk to a neurologist and ask for an EEG because it could be a seizure. I do not want to worry you,¬†maybe it‚Äôs not that at all but what you describe seems like you had one. It can totally happen one time and never happen again tho."
BipolarReddit,f1dk0kl,t3_d8vbem,1569386905.0,"I‚Äôm a neuropsychologist with bipolar 2 as well. I‚Äôm sorry for what happened... I think our position are unfortunately very complicated, I must admit I‚Äôm afraid this kind of thing could also happen to me because I could totally see it happen. There is absolutely no link between our disease and our legitimacy in the exercice of our profession, or our capacity to do it, but some people see it as a failure to be mentally sick when you‚Äôre supposed to help people with mental illness. If you want to discuss feel free to pm me !"
BipolarReddit,eyqaxkt,t3_cy08o0,1567334975.0,"What you describe sounds a lot like a manic episode, but you may want to look at recent scientific studies that shows a correlation between spending sprees, money addiction and abilify. Being bipolar add further complications because we are prone to this kind of symptoms, and it is now recognised as a possible side effect of abilify ! Maybe you can tell your psychiatrist about it, your treatment could be ajusted ? I wish you well, take care"
