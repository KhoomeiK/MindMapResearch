You realise that life is just full of suffering, with momentary happiness, constant desire and you welcome the end of it all. You fill the void with drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, music or something else, but they don't do much to help in the long run. Being a doomer is shit, i wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy."
