femalefashionadvice,fndiv2v,t3_g13xow,1586871009.0,"I made a really shitty [fake Louis Vuitton mask](https://imgur.com/a/e3PUKfI) a while ago but it doesn‚Äôt really work that well lol.

I‚Äôm sending this style to friends that need masks 

I think masks or mask covers that match other accessories like bags, shoes, etc will definitely be a trend. Kind of scared to see how brands will manage to profit off of this though.... 

What if it becomes a faux pas for your mask to clash with your outfit?"

It‚Äôs funny because I used to hate this song and think the lyrics were so over simplistic and corny. Now I love it..... that‚Äôs how a lot of Lana songs go for me though! Used to HATE Black Beauty now I love it. I love that Lana‚Äôs not afraid to be straightforward with her lyrics."
popheads,fmd2gr3,t1_fmcqscu,1585957858.0,"I was diagnosed with depression (misdiagnosed?) before I was diagnosed with bipolar 1. IIRC bipolar has interesting diagnostic criteria where you have to have a certain type of manic or hypomanic episode to be diagnosed, and the episode can‚Äôt be due to drug use etc. But bipolar people also suffer depressive episodes which I think can appear pretty similar to a depression diagnosis.

lots of people don‚Äôt find out they‚Äôre bipolar until relatively later in life also! I love that she‚Äôs talking about this and and I hope she talks about it more... I feel like sometimes bipolar artists can be very ‚Äúit‚Äôs a superpower! Don‚Äôt take medicine!‚Äù so it‚Äôs nice to hear her speaking about educating herself on the diagnosis, etc"
