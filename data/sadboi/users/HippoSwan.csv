MakeUpAddictionUK,fhh57cm,t3_f312q0,1581594157.0,Have a look at your veins on your wrist/elbow. Are they green or are the blue? Green means you are warmer undertones - like yellows and peachy. If they are blue then colder undertones - like pinks and blues.
Anxiety,fhh502n,t3_f31qmf,1581593926.0,So happy and proud for you. You should feel proud for yourself. One day at a time :D
IDontWorkHereLady,f8bwhb8,t3_e0306g,1574446927.0,This happened to me this week. I work at a local theatre and went into a book shop and this lady assumed I worked there. Long story short. There is probably a stern complaint with the manager about me.
