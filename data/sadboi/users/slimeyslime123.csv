The solution to that problem is then abortion, which he states may be the outcome that produces the least amount of harm."
AskReddit,fkepxh1,t3_fi1gju,1584118247.0,"I'm not religious, but I'm very against abortion as it stands. In the UK, abortion is allowed up the 24 weeks. There was a proposal to change it to 22 or 20 weeks in but they were defeated. The change was based on the fact that medical advancements had been made allowing a child to survive outside of the womb before 24 weeks. That was in 2008. It's now 2020. IIRC, there's around a 30% chance of a child surviving outside the womb at 23 weeks. Surely then, a 23 week old fetus is a bloody child. At what point was it not human? What point was it not murder? If you were to kill that 23 week old child inside the womb, that would be fine but to kill it outside the womb isn't not? Doesn't sit right with me. There's something seriously wrong there. 

Now with that being said, that issue is whether or not the growing human is a life. As far as I understand, the qualitative attributes we measure to determine life exist waaaay before 24 weeks. Like, 6-8 weeks for heart and brain activity. That means, for me, anything past 6 weeks is a 100% no go. 

There's also an argument for autonomy. You have the life of the child, and whether or not that child has a right to your body. IMHO those are the only two arguments that need to be made. For me autonomy is quite simple. You don't have a right to do what you want when that child is born. You are required to take care of it. You cannot neglect or kill your children. You also made the decision to have that child when you put your or a penis inside of your or a vagina. That is a consequence that you have to live by. You cannot punch me in the face and not be arrested. You did something and lost your right to autonomy. 

My proposed changes would be this. No abortions if there's signs of life, and both parents are required to agree. In the case that a mother cannot continue the pregnancy due to medical reasons, physical or psychological. The pregnancy can be terminated. Losing one life is better than two. 

I have not mentioned edge cases but would be willing to discuss them. Also, don't just rage at me for not agreeing with you. Don't be passive aggressive. If you want to enlighten me, let's have a discussion. This is a sensitive topic for a lot of people."
