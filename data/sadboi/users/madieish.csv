EDAnonymous,fi17xgz,t3_f5jx5i,1582052407.0,Blu by BENEE!!! literally all songs on her EP remind me of being so small just a few months ago...and Chewing Cotton Wool by The Japanese House. dude I can't even listen to those anymore I'll just get angry
BingeEatingDisorder,fha74w3,t1_fh6w4y4,1581399146.0,I get it. it's so frustrating to feel so back and forth about the binging. one second I'm convinced it's the only thing that'll make me happier and then afterwards im a puddle of guilt and shame. it has GOT to be one of the hardest things in life to overcome. good luck on your search for help ‚ù§Ô∏è
BingeEatingDisorder,fha6qb2,t1_fh7hvs7,1581398807.0,"that's so amazing! that's the mentality I trusted going into recovery but now I feel like there's no way I could like this body...it doesn't even feel healthy, and I keep glamorizing restriction. I'm trying to honor hunger but it's making me feel like I am just an abnormal, extreme overeater and recovery is my excuse. i didn't think it would be this hard. how long til you stopped craving all of the time? really hoping this will run its course and I'll feel better soon. thank you for sharing üíñ"
BingeEatingDisorder,fh5v38q,t1_fh5tmyi,1581292539.0,"yes! fighting for the control back is what is so difficult, it takes so much energy but at the same time so does BED, so whatever...this puts our self-esteem thru sooo much. it's just invalidating now to think about who I was...and hard to not glamorize those behaviors. I keep going from one extreme to the other :/ I wish we could be balanced with it all too..."

EDAnonymous,famtgai,t3_e9vy6l,1576212387.0,"I can tell sometimes in public too, it's really strange. seeing their face confirms it I think, maybe it's in the eyes or something idek but i can FEEL their pain"
fuckeatingdisorders,fae06d1,t3_e8pzam,1575990755.0,I'm in the same place. someone just put me under or something and wake me up when I'm healthy....er
AnorexiaNervosa,fad3lx3,t3_e8i2l0,1575954302.0,"okay first of all you're amazing...you said all of the right things. it does feel like my body has gone kinda dormant and nonreactive --which like you said is biological so that makes sense to my brain. because i know I'm going to have to increase my intake, I want to do it JUST the way you described. controlled but in a positive way that will actually leave me feeling good. I don't want to be drowning in candy wrappers and pizza boxes, I genuinely like fitness and healthy foods and I crave structure as well...
I KNOW that your approach will help me a lot and keep any anxiety at bay.  ultimately I think if I don't go about it this way while incorporating safe foods with challenges, I'll only end up resorting to restriction again. 

thank you so much for taking the time to respond!!!!"

EDAnonymous,fa8y2l0,t3_e7vp8y,1575857528.0,"it flips like a switch. im at a dangerous bmi and i don't even like the way that i look now. it's crazy how fast people suddenly decide that you're not okay anymore and everything just gets tense and scary and feels like a threat. the disorder becomes repulsive to others which only makes us feel even worse, and it's so easy to get mad at them for speaking up because they don't know the half of anything really. it's laughable."
AnorexiaNervosa,fa0kydf,t1_f9zs2de,1575756689.0,"I'm between 5'3 and 5'4, I have considered wearing heavier clothing and stuff so hopefully that'll help. thank you!"
AnorexiaNervosa,f9yxj32,t1_f9yr5m4,1575735296.0,yes it's my regular doctor! you pinpointed how I felt lol I feel like I'm just gonna get judged and be misunderstood...thank you!
AnorexiaNervosa,f9yo5iu,t1_f9ymmz8,1575731394.0,"thank you, I think thats a good idea too."
EatingDisorders,f96hsmx,t3_e3layx,1575145338.0,"you're amazing for this. it could potentially be a whirlwind and a half kind of experience for you, and she may not be able to devote all of her energy towards a relationship like she wants to right now. but on the other hand, you may be the one who can help pull her through when she needs it the most...but it will be difficult for you at times. you seem to understand the severity of all of this so i applaud you!"
