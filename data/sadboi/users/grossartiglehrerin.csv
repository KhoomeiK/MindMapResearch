depression,f9uot7h,t3_e6wilf,1575654999.0,"I had two doctors who prescribed me the same medicine but under different names.  I could not walk.  I couldn't drive.  I couldn't take out the trash.  I was helpless.  
I reached out to God; asking Him to kill me or heal me.  I awoke the next day and stopped taking the medicine.  I began to walk without a walker and gained back most of my strengh.
Doctors do not tell you about the side effects of medicines. 
I was depressed after my brother commited suicide in 2014, my boyfriend died in 2015,  and in 2016 my roomate moved out.
Watch out what you wish for when you are depressed!  You just might get something as horrifying that I received!  I was not glad that I slept for 3 and a half year.  Endure the pain or change some how!  Seek help."

travel,f9sp5xh,t3_e6rjpn,1575597184.0,"I would like to move to Munich, Germany.  I have lived a great life and want to continue to do so but in Germany.  Life is too short to be bored.  I love a good adventure with a very cool person who is honest.  I love meeting interesting people who know how to have fun without drinking.  I am always on a diet because I am a diabetic.  Having diabetes is managable only if one watches what they eat.  Laughing is life."
