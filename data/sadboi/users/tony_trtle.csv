casualiama,f5edm6g,t1_f5bc39c,1572168933.0,"hey sorry for the late response! i quit smoking for a few reasons. i’ve been smoking everyday since i was 15, and i just hate that i’ve spent my entire teenage life high. weed has also really affected my mental health in a very negative way, so i’m trying to take care of myself now. 

with your second question, do you mean how was i affected with weed or without? with weed - i’ve realized that weed has made me very paranoid and anxious, so it makes it difficult to get anything done or to lead a productive life. without weed - i’ve already noticed a huge difference in my productivity and mood. i’m feeling happier and i have a lot more energy. definitely less anxious, too. being sober is pretty cool lmao. hopefully i answered the question right. thanks so much for asking :^)"

how much do you weigh jline123?"
casualiama,f54jppp,t1_f54iiaq,1571984765.0,"i was actually doing some research on that yesterday. it's crazy to me, because i've always had crazy dreams, even when i was smoking. they've only gotten weirder and weirder, though. it's making me realize the full potential of my brain haha 

i hope you're able to sort through whatever is going on in your life! stay safe, and happy tripping!"
casualiama,f54jhba,t1_f54iyd3,1571984615.0,"hey man, everyone has different experiences! dmt may work well for you, but some people are best with no substances at all. it's possible to give up a vice without taking on another one. i'll do research for sure, but cucupanda makes a great point as well."
casualiama,f54jbzv,t1_f54ipzn,1571984519.0,"i understand what you mean! i'm not sure if i'll actually do any more hallucinogens or try DMT. i know there can be great side effects, but like you're saying - why fight fire with fire? 

for now, i plan on staying away from all substances just because i'm terrible at using things in moderation. i've struggled in the past with more than just weed, so it would probbly be best for me to stay completely sober. i do think you both have great points, though. maybe another time in my life i'll try dmt or something like it. (or at least research it) for now, i  think i'll just try my best and enjoy my life with a clear mind. 

thank you for the great comparison and insight!!!"
casualiama,f54hz8k,t1_f54hrjq,1571983157.0,"i've definitely noticed the same thing! just in the past few days, i have had the craziest dreams. i wake up and my first thought is usually ""what the fuck just happened?"" it's like waking up from a crazy acid trip or something, lmao. the boredom and lack of motivation are for sure the hardest parts, though. just trying to stay as busy as possible! 

and hey, thanks so much! same to you. have you stopped smoking, or was it just a temporary break?"
casualiama,f54hq7a,t3_dm61bx,1571982853.0,"hopefully i'm not too late here. my sister has tourettes as well, her biggest struggle with it is having to explain to people that ""yes, i'm okay. i just flail my limbs around sometimes and it's out of my control.""

what would you say is the biggest struggle that you've encountered due to your tourettes?"
casualiama,f54h9a8,t1_f54h5jw,1571982298.0,"never said it was hard, man. just bored out of my mind. maybe try to not judge people and compare struggles like its a competition. we're all in this shit together! 

congrats, though, if you're clean after using for years!"
casualiama,f54h67y,t1_f54gz2q,1571982200.0,"i definitely think that's true! i haven't had any ""withdrawal"" side effects or anything, i mostly am just bored and don't know what to do with myself. but i'm already feeling better without smoking, just after a few days.

i really appreciate the kind words, it means a lot to me"
casualiama,f54gnrm,t1_f54ggdj,1571981631.0,"i'll definitely keep that in mind! i'm not sure where i'd ever be able to find DMT, but i know that hallucinogens can be really helpful for the shit i'm going through. (if used correctly, of course) i'll look more into it. thanks dude!"
casualiama,f54gh2o,t1_f54gagd,1571981429.0,"i am trying to quit smoking! in the past few months, i've noticed a lot of negative side effects from smoking daily. (lack of motivation, anxiety, i get irritable without it, etc) it also hit me that i haven't been sober at all as a teenager, and that was a huge wake up call that made me wanna start over, i guess. 

right now i'm just working at a pizza place but i'm hoping to go to college next year. 

and my cat is doing great!!! he's sleeping right now. pretty boring dude but i love him. thanks for the questions!"

Spectrum,evcn0dk,t3_cjcv80,1564418817.0,"The billing for new services doesn’t start until the equipment has been hooked up and activated, so you won’t be billed as soon as your order is placed. But if you’re doing a self installation, you cannot choose a set start date. 

If the equipment is being shipped out to you, it has to be sent to your service address on the account. So, if you want the equipment shipped directly to your home, I would recommend waiting until you’re actually moved into the new place. It generally takes 3 days for the equipment to arrive at your house, if that helps at all? 

And yes, the account holder has to be the one picking the equipment up from the store!"
