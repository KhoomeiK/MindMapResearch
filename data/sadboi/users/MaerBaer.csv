It's very difficult being away from loved ones. But at least we have can call each other and find creative ways to spend time together.

Coronavirus,fllde2d,t3_fpbug6,1585258203.0,"Is it possible that my husband had coronavirus?

We live in midwest and he works for a global company headquartered in NYC. Many higher ups from big cities will make their rounds to their satellite offices.

With that in mind, early February, he came down with all of the symptoms. It hit him hard. I had to take time off from my work just to make sure he didn't end up in the hospital. Scared the shit out of me. I mean, we're late 20s. A virus shouldn't just take him out like, you know?

Doc tested him for flu and pneumonia, both negative. They could only treat the symptoms. 

Also our local schools closed for 2 days because of some respiratory virus going around the same week I took my husband to the doc. And his coworkers on his floor all took turns calling in sick with similar symptoms. Am I crazy to suspect that he had coronavirus?"
Coronavirus,flhaccp,t1_flh0m6a,1585158996.0,"I agree 100 percent. I'm guilty as well. I don't do anything past voting as far as political activism goes. Maybe that'll change one day, but if I'm being completely honest with myself, it probably won't. I love my friends and family too much to risk losing them over political ideology. I've seen so many families fall apart because of it. It sucks.

I was visiting my family before this pandemic and my mother was venting to me about how disappointed and frustrated she is that my younger brother was going into political activism to support a political candidate that she couldn't stand.

I was shocked at my mother for wanting to deter my younger brother, who had been struggling to find motivation to move out of the parent's house and start a career! Like who cares who he supports if it is motivating him to start his life and become independent? 

But I digress... maybe there will be a future will people will be open minded and receptive to each other's views and won't give in to their baser, more tribal instincts when another human being doesn't think they same way as you."

Of course these are the nicer homes of profs and docs who make a decent salary and probably have enough saved up to afford these home projects right now.

My own boss is making home improvement runs because and contacting painters because he's bored out of his mind not being able to go anywhere or do anything. So he's just gonna work on his home.
