The healing process starts with season 1 to 3 which are utterly perfect and are almost a video companion to the books. Once you accept this, you'll start seeing season 4 as a nice, stand alone thing, you'll re-enjoy Tyrion's trial and Oberyn and all that. Season 5 has some good eps and good scenes which can be enjoyed on their own...
Season 6 to 8 are absolute shit so I can't help you with that.

Like a good friend you will meet in the future, or a good man/woman you will fall for, think of this person, think of this positive person that will enter your life. This person will treat you right and will respect you. This person exists and is out there in the world, but you must protect your deep self in order to be able to meet people, you can't let yourself be destroyed by this bad FP, because another better FP will come along and this bad FP you will never think of him again. Think of future FP, and think of protecting yourself, your body, your mind. FP is just that right now, two letters, it's a placeholder that BAD FP is holding, but he can be easily replaced, and he will be, but you need to sort yourself out a little bit first. Let him go so you can get something better.

Edit: Also let go of 'there's only him for me', 'nobody else will ever want me', 'if its not him it's nobody' if those are thoughts you have, those are lies that anxiety/black and white thinking tell you, don't even let them into your head because they will poison your positive thinking."
