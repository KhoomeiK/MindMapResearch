brightertomorrow,ff6qhug,t1_ff68byj,1579632762.0,"             I am more than happy to get to a higher soapbox. You're completely right, knowledge is key.

          While staying in my car at a truck-stop in Louisiana, a lot of people were pulling in hauling brand new travel trailers of all sizes. It didn't take me long to figure out that they were transporting them. If you have a pickup truck that is somewhat dependable and a decent driving record, it doesn't take much to get a job transporting them. At least if you stuck in your vehicle you're getting paid for it.
            I also came up with an ingenious idea or at least I think so. Many Truckers travel with their pets now. The majority have dogs but those that are brave carry their cats around. Clothespin on nose now. I have a small dog that got stuck living in the car with me. getting a bath for her was the hardest thing and so very necessary. If I had the money to set up a little trailer with on demand hot water and go to the truck stops for a day or two, I would make more than enough  to live on. And maybe sew/sell some animal clothing, treats on the side. Traveling from one truck stop to another. Most of us spend money we don't have on our animals.

                 I wish more people knew
about your hard work. Checking out the links now."

I don't know when I will have anymore to pay. I have to take a chance. As I said before, if I can get into my storage shed, I will get my papers for my car and sell the damn thing.
           I appreciate everything that you've done. I really do. And like I said before, I'm more than happy to send you a copy of the storage unit notice of lien w intent to auction and I am also more than willing to take advice.
           The guy that wants me dead knows from his friend that I am legit. He needs to be angry at me for some reason. Problem is, he will get his wish.
       I know that I'm all over the place with my writing. Lately forming thoughts has been so much more difficult.
                 I thank you again for trying to help and also trying to understand everything. You said that you're young. Please continue to be a good person. I can tell that you are. I have not read any of your profile. To be honest all I've tried to do today is respond to you and find a way to take care of the storage.
         Thank you for listening. I really don't talk to people anymore."
homeless,fds7y1f,t3_emsvrk,1578696394.0,"I get it... I have been contemplating the same. Trying to give my only friend away now. You have to be younger than me and you have to be healthier than I am. (Praying you are) 
In my area, there are no real services to help.
        Please keep fighting. I know your desperation. I feel for you. They have given you plenty of leads here.
     Be stubborn if you can't be strong.
       Life can be so much better but 
     You have to be here to find that out. If you need someone to yell at that understands completely. PM me.
        I am praying for us both."
homeless,fds5p09,t1_fdrgyco,1578694931.0,At least this person would not be homeless anymore. If they got caught. It might be better in the long run. I know I would almost rather be in jail then be scared every night of my life. I'm too old to be going to this crap.
helpme,fds52fg,t1_fdrwf1w,1578694529.0,"I have recvd help from pizza angels. They sent me some clothes from Amazon gave me a 50. Card for Amazon 2 subway cards totaling 75. 2 Walmart cards totaling 75. Plus some supplies for my foot and toiletries and dog treats.
         I have also recvd money from assistance page totaling 108. A few weeks ago.
         What do I have to do? You tell me that I know but I have in no way tried to deceive anybody. I had to buy 2 car tires, and a battery. In the last few months. i have good ins but I still have to pay a bit for my long term insulin 34.  I quit the day time injections because my blood sugar has dropped considerably.plus oil and gas treatment etc. Showers are 14. At the truck stop and I know they are cheaper at the health club but I only found out about that after reading the homeless subreddit. Washing clothes is 7.00 I have 20.00 left on my subway card, I still have  credit on my amazon only because I don't have room in my car and am saving it for something I really need. What do you think I need to do? Please tell me. I am very open to suggestions. I hate this life and I hate having to ask for help. I am desperate enough to panhandle but will either get fined 200. Or go to jail. Or both. I would go in the hospital today to have the surgery I need if they would keep me the length of time needed for recovery. They will not.  I need to have a roof over my head for a minimum of one month so I can have a vacuum on my foot. I cannot convince you nor do I have the energy to try anymore. If you have a suggestion I am more than happy to listen to it. The shelter here it cost $300 a month Plus food stamp card. They have people doing drugs and getting drunk and od'ing in this place. I have been sober for 35 years and my emotional state is too fragile to be there. Oh by the way, I did receive $15 worth of gas, a meal from subway and a diabetic testing kit. Plus dog treats from the church. I have also pd. 50.00 per month for my  cell 38.00 for a birth certificate 36.for a post office box and I smoke 1 pack of cigs in 9 days. This is everything I can remember right now. The only reason that I replied to that comment yesterday was because I thought you were the guy that wants me to freeze to death. As I said before, I cannot think of a way out and I am willingly to think about doing almost anything. If I were younger and prettier, I would have been turning tricks before asking anybody for anything. If you have a solution, I am more than open to suggestions. I just can't continue to defend myself. Also...how do storage units work? I know I have recvd my final notice 1st and only)
I can't even answer the phone. I told her that I thought it might be paid today but sent her a msg that it wouldn't be. She has called 3 times."
helpme,fdruek9,t1_fdrucvk,1578689887.0,Letter.
helpme,fdrucvk,t1_fdridqs,1578689858.0,"Do you have an email address that I can forward the leather from the storage unit ? And you're completely right about somebody giving me $200. On my GoFundMe. I had to pay for a blood test and a urine test at a clinic that does not take my insurance. This was to get on antidepressants as soon as poss. I did not think that I would lose the storage unit so fast. I was pd thru oct. My dog had seizures not that long ago. I rushed her to the vet. She had never had seizures before or since but I had to spend money to make sure she wasn't poisoned. There is basically a wait-and-see attitude as to what's going on with her. I have put gas in my car. I don't waste money. Even when I had money in the bank. The person that said they would pay the storage has never replied to my PMS. As a matter of fact, I am replying to their post today with a thank you anyway. If you can tell me a way to keep them from selling my s*** I would love to hear it. The Petro Truck Stop that I've been sleeping at Cost $7 a night. They started this Thanksgiving. I don't pay every night but most nights I do. I have plenty of receipts. I have very few winter clothes and have had to run the car to keep warm. I hate doing that. I don't even know why I feel the need to explain this but I do. I am open to suggestions.  I have lost 15 lbs in approximately  the last two and a half months. I had to apply for food stamps 3 times in person and once online before being approved and I don't have them yet. As I said, I am more than happy to forward a copy of the letter from the storage unit. I don't know what else I can say. I feel like I shouldn't care what people think but I don't want to go out without people knowing the truth. Any other questions?"
helpme,fdrhmef,t1_fdr5124,1578684588.0,"One day I asked for help on the assistance page. He was the first one to help. He sent me $5.98. I sent him a note telling him how thankful I was and that I was eating a protein bar that was horrible and two bananas. I was very thankful. Well as the day went on, he drank and became cocky. And sent me more money. $7. He didn't like the idea that I had bananas. Wanted me to have more. I was happy with the bananas. Well in a joking manner I said you can be a bit of an ass sometimes can't you? I like your attitude. Well apparently that was the mistake of my life. He decided that I was a c*** a scammer and deserved to die. I thought that you were him.
     I don't care anymore. he really hurt my feelings. If I was in my normal ĺcircumstances, I would have never had to ask for help. And nobody on the internet could have affected me this way. Today I lose my storage shed. Which has all the papers that would guarantee that I get out of this situation. $275 the money that I would spend on a stray animal normally. I'm not accustomed to being flat ass broke. I'm not accustomed to be cold all the time. Or scared. I don't normally cry. My beautiful dog has no clue what the hell is going on. She has never seen me this emotional. I sound very self-centered but I'm really not. Just overwhelmed. I even feel sorry for the guy that hates my guts. He knows I'm legit. Even one of his friends told him so. I have proven it with photographs of my surroundings at the truck stop would have been chatting with him all day long. The guy just doesn't care. I don't even know who initially reported him or why. I will be more than happy to send you copies of the PM's. I can't copy properly from my phone. Anyway it's all moot point. I don't even know why I'm continuing to try. Please forgive all the typos. I'm on my phone doing talk text. I have a bad connection"
helpme,fdr2a42,t1_fdopxfx,1578678499.0,I have a question for you. You said but you hope that I freeze to death. You said that I'm a scammer in what way have I scammed anybody?. Will you be happy when I'm dead? Will that satisfy your anger? I told you that I liked your and I really did. Until I decided that you can pick on me but nobody can pick on you. I have said I'm sorry multiple times. No more. Take care of yourself
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fdqke1x,t3_emrdtb,1578668790.0,"You did good! Sorry that you felt that way but that's part of the journey. I felt that way recently after 35 years of sobriety.
 It almost kicked my ass but the people in this subreddit saved my ass.
       Hopefully your days get easier."
helpme,fdouurn,t1_fdonb9v,1578613394.0,"Do what you need to do. You didn't put all the other messages on there. When I said I liked your attitude I meant it. I was only picking back. When I realized that you took it seriously, I apologized. And you told me don't worry about it. You had me laughing after one of the worst days of my life. I told you how grateful I was .  I also told you if you really needed  that last $5 back  that I would send it to you. And I told you how much I appreciated it. I'm more than happy to let everybody see exactly what was written. I thank you again for the $13. And I'm sorry again for saying that you can be a bit of an ass. I really thought with your attitude that we were going to be friends. I was crushed that I made you upset. So if you need to continue this and it makes you feel good, go ahead and do what you need to do. I can't apologize anymore but I can tell you if I get $13, and I don't have to use it to keep my car warm or eat 1 time in 2 days, I will send it back to you."
