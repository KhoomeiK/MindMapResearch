I drew the King of Pentacles for Tom Nook and it is an obvious fit.  Since King of Pentacles represents "" wealth, business, leadership, security, discipline, abundance"" (Biddy Tarot). Tom Nook is a successful business man who is a leader within his community. He runs a business and is a property developer. Tom Nook will never evict you and it takes discipline and time to pay back the loan he gives you without cheating.

I mirrored the some of the symbolism on the Rider Waite card with the crown and the pentacle in the left hand and the grapes instead of tanuki leaves."

I haven't been able to quit because of self harm either so I think I know where you are coming from.

I would try to reduce your reliance on weed as much as possible. Smoke as little as possible to avoid self harm and develop coping skills against the self harm before you try tackling weed. I think cutting is a much bigger issue than a weed addictions especially if you understand that you are addicted to weed and have the discipline to quit.

Meditation,fh28q6e,t1_fh28p67,1581240632.0,"Doing my own research I came across this article: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5353526/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5353526/). I'd like to point out the line ""Qualitative research on mindfulness meditation shows that it may  increase the awareness of difficult feelings and exacerbate  psychological problems. ""

I was correct. Meditation was harming me."
Meditation,fh28p67,t1_fgu9mw1,1581240593.0,"I think you misunderstood what I was trying to get at.

And actually no, my therapist did not suggest I meditate because of these symptoms because I haven't told her about these symptoms yet. I specifically asked about something that would help with concentration.

I understand that I can get distracted while meditating and the point of meditation is to realize when I get distracted and return to focus without judgement or whatever version of that it is.

And no, anger occurs because of feelings of pain. It does not have to have anything to do with expectations.

And what I am experiencing is not just anger but sadness as well. Deep depression. I mentioned I had bipolar 2 for a reason, because I have bipolar depression and I am prone to mixed episodes that include states where I can not regulate my thoughts normally.

I think you misunderstand where my bad feelings are coming from and I think you are stretching it a bit. They are not from misplaced expectations but from the bipolar disorder. My disorder is out of my control. It is occurring in the moment, it is not a passing thought. They are chronic and reoccurring. Especially the thoughts self harm.

I do not care if I lose count of my breaths every other breath or whatever. I care that I feel worse at the start of meditation than at the beginning, meaning something must be going wrong.

My problem is that meditation is not helping me to manage my emotions. It is actively making the bad ones worse. It is actively harming me. Thoughts of self harm are always bad full stop. I have had sessions where I start fine but end up thinking about self harm. These are not successful meditation sessions, these sessions are actively harming me."

It was my dream for awhile to live off of my creativity but I've had to put those dreams to bed as I have realized I'm not as good of an artist or writer as I thought I was.
