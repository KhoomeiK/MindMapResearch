television,fp898mb,t3_gbrwsg,1588386682.0,I watched Scrubs when I started as a nurse. ‚ÄúUnderdog‚Äù always resonated with me since I was a new nurse in the ER at the time. I still enjoy listening to his groups music! Rest In Peace
Ohio,fmxyrmi,t1_fmumsyn,1586474547.0,If you‚Äôve never been a church member I don‚Äôt think you can say you understand how they work. Churches are much different than any other nonprofit I‚Äôve ever seen.
Coronavirus,fmgw750,t1_fmgoo8b,1586059488.0,I think it‚Äôs a little of both. People that haven‚Äôt seen it directly might not take it seriously. But also humor may be a way to cope with an overwhelming sense of anxiety about it all. As a former ER nurse I can attest that a dark sense of humor was required at times. Hoping everyone on the front lines stays safe

OSU,fk2v0f7,t1_fk2t3vb,1583809828.0,There is generally still instruction. Some of my classes were synchronously held online. Which let me tell you is far more painful than in person but may be an option if you want to have ‚Äúface to face‚Äù with the teacher. My grad program was MORE expensive than my undergrad and was almost exclusively online. Obviously different tiers but the online classes costed more. Good luck!

Covid19_Ohio,fjp9rd1,t3_fe41fc,1583545341.0,I think it is absolutely ridiculous. As a former ER nurse I fear what will happen when people start testing positive here. It will blow up. I saw a tweet from ODH touting they were ‚Äútotally prepared‚Äù yet we have no tests? Are you for real!? After seeing the gross mismanagement of this I have absolutely no confidence in our government
Economics,fj6svw5,t3_fbso5f,1583079446.0,Unfortunate that the US is so dependent on China for a lot of goods. I believe we will suffer from the lack of production in China in the coming months. But good to see reduction in pollution. Mother Nature is taking it back!

Long-standing negative thought patterns can be changed through counseling. If you‚Äôre finding you‚Äôre not making progress, medication can help but it won‚Äôt fix your problems by any means. I think it is wonderful you have aspirations. Look at your mental and physical wellbeing as the foundation to make the rest of that happen. Best of luck to you in your journey."

worldpolitics,f59bsjr,t1_f57torl,1572081708.0,"Andrew Yang has mentioned UBI, which you cite in one of your articles. I encourage you to look into his specific policies as they are quite detailed. I feel he is for the people and one of the reasons he started running in the first place. He is the underdog but imho politicians so far have missed the mark. We need an advocate for the majority of people in this country."
worldpolitics,f59bi9g,t1_f58a5xg,1572081262.0,"Andrew Yang has some similar ideas, he isn't quite as radical but he might be able to pull people from the other side of the aisle. I encourage you to look at his policies. For me I worry about the longevity of these older candidates, Bernie included. It is no doubt though he sparks a fire under people and he has worked his whole life to get to this point."

Psychiatry,eyupzwp,t3_cyu8ca,1567468992.0,"I am a board certified psychiatric nurse practitioner and I absolutely love the field of psychiatry. You don't have to be a doctor to work in psychiatry, though it would add another year or so onto your masters if you pursued something like PMHNP. I think the only person who knows that answer is yourself, however, when looking at all the available tools you can use, being a doctor or nurse practitioner provides you with more options (such as prescribing, depending on state for NP). A great deal of clients use medications to facilitate therapy and personally it has been nice being able to determine that variable during treatment. Best of luck to you!"

mentalhealth,etlkhpz,t3_cc5hp6,1562938887.0,"I'm sorry this happened to you. In the future, with hopefully a new provider, always know if you are over 18 you are not required to bring anyone else in to your sessions. Sometimes collateral information can be helpful to providers, but it is your right to determine who can come in or have access to your info. As far as her mom dying, the session is not about her, period. This is manipulation and it is unacceptable. What you said probably wasn't the best thing to say, but neither was her response. Technically, if she didn't give you a plan or anything like that I don't think it's illegal but definitely unethical and immoral. I work in mental health and have heard of staff saying similar things to borderline personalify disorder patients but don't think it is right... Keep us updated. Don't stop trying to get help and better yourself. It's unfortunate even people in the field can hold you back."

healthcare,erluzze,t3_c2hw92,1560997586.0,"This. I started as a nurse aide, then a registered nurse and now a nurse practitioner. I have seen the different aspects of Healthcare and it is so frustrating. I will say though that you can and do make a difference. You can help people through some scary and uncomfortable times and make it a little easier for them. You do make a difference. But systemically it is so unfortunate that profits come first. Many of my treatment choices are dictated by cost and insurance, not what I feel is best for the client. Lobbying has gotten me down lately bc if you don't have money then you can just forget about that. Time for some major checks and balances with health care for sure"
news,eramklc,t1_er99dlz,1560647826.0,A big problem now is the emmeshment of both private and public sectors for specific interests. This puts people and their health at the bottom and profit at the top. Totally backwards
