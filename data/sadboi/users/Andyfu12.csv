childfree,fg5pw4c,t3_eww211,1580534641.0,"I have on and off depression. It isn’t in the ballpark of being as bad this year as it was a few years ago when I got to the point where I was telling myself “ok. Just get in the shower. Fuck going to work. Just... go get in the shower... ok now, eat something.... ok... maybe clothes are a good idea, where are some washed clothes? Get those on. Ok. A drive isn’t that bad, right? You can drive right now.” And I spent my whole day just willing myself to do little task after little task to function and maintain an income. 

Even though I haven’t been back to that place in a long time, I know that it’s coming again, eventually, because that’s just how it seems to work for me: on and off. 

That’s, by far not the only reason, but certainly a major reason why I don’t want kids. It’s always coming. 

I know I can get through it when it does come... but I also know that I wouldn’t get through it with any added tasks."

Also: Jesus Christ, yes, I needed to hear that. That’s why I love the fucking internet. My friends would never say something like that to me, but fuck. I am that girl. I AM THAT GIRL. I feel like everyone I date is so goddamn wholesome. I think I’m so afraid of letting “Josh” go, because Ive never been loved this unconditionally before. And I do love him. (I’ve never told him that- it would be too confusing) Because I don’t think it’s the same love. It’s trash can love from a trash can person."

“I call her Tutor. 

Because it makes for more conversation ease than 
‘the pressure of a hand on my chest in the middle of a dream’ or ‘the faint call of a word I mispronounced this evening’ or ‘the very real and tangible experience of being led by someone into the dark.’ 

‘What were you up to last night, Simon?’ My father might ask me in the morning. 
‘Taking a walk with my Tutor,’ I might answer. 

I am carried, quite traditionally now, into lonely meanderings around my tree farm, stuck on an idea: 

That I can, no, that I must, be proficient in Latin. 

It’s a queer haunting, because, even as I had mindlessly enrolled in the course to complete my English Major hours, I never once felt compelled to take Latin over any number of potentials to fill my foreign language acquisition requirement. 
Sure, I knew it wouldn’t be a complete waste of my time, 
But I was not transfixed. 

I’ve never been one to claim I can know my own destiny, but I assure you, I know it now. 

This thing. 
This tourniquet. 
This tightening grip on all that I once found valuable uses for my time and energy
Will not release me. 

I know it seems crazy. 
But it’s the truth…. And it feels as if… I am cursed.” 

Dr. Trudow taps a pen against her notebook, closes it. 

“Did you feel as if you didn’t have any choices as a child?” 

“No, this isn’t about my childhood,” I answer sternly. 

An insidious tug of her cheeks. 

“Look, I knew this was stupid. I’m done here.” 

“Sit down, Simon.” 

The open door glides shut, in the same odd string of moans I had heard from own bedroom door every night the past two weeks. 

The Tutor. 

“There is book. You will soon find it. And when you do, you will read it.”

“What book?”

“...it’s apart of this one.”"

I’m not sure if this is a common feeling? 

But I’m quite happy being untied to anyone. I’m already an anxious person to begin with and I know I’m much less anxious now than I would be in some alternate universe in which I’m stuck in a home with someone else.... Which sounds a little heartless, I guess... but I’m just not good with relationships. I like my freedom too much... and my space and my quiet time. I don’t think that’s a bad thing. It’s just how it is. It’s ok to not be married. There are so many benefits to being able to do whatever you want, with whomever you want, whenever you want without someone bickering at you about when you’ll be home or when you’ll do xyz or when you’ll stop writing alone in your room. 

I’m also sure marriage can be wonderful and happy for the type of person who can function in relationships. I’m not trying to shit on people in marriages. I just don’t want one because I’m happier alone."
