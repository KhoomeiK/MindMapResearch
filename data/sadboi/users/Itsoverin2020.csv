While I was in the parking lot driving I saw a rather attractive girl in a ripped cocktail dress flag me down. My immediate thought, unfortunately, was ""I bet this girl was raped on campus and needs help"" so I let her in my car. To my surprise, she was much older than college age. Probably 35 or so. She was still smoking hot. She was very drunk and her phone, dead. Apparently she was at a wedding reception across the street from my school and her phone died and her POS husband just sort of left her there drunk. She was from California and had no idea where she was. I asked her if she knew the address of the people she was staying with and she did. I pulled over and typed it in. She immediately started to kiss me and try to fuck me but she was so drunk she kept falling asleep so I knew that was a no-no. I seat-belted her in so she would be upright. On the drive to her family, she told me about her life. She was a psychologist with 3 kids. She was there for her cousin's wedding. We talked and talked. I drove her to the address a few towns over and to my surprise it was correct. She gave me another kiss and told me ""Sometimes you just got to have faith"" and went inside. I think about her from time to time. I wonder what she is up to now."
