masskillers,fot44ao,t1_fosvz7k,1588044214.0,"That’s an interesting point for sure, although I have to disagree. Adam was said to have cut contact with his father (and brother) long before the shooting happened. I’m not sure why his father would have any valid say in Adam’s motivations given that he was practically nonexistent from Adam’s life at that point. I believe Adam said “no” regarding his mother dying because he more likely than not felt that way towards the death of anyone in general, not just his mother. He had a unique view on it, as he did on most things. I personally think he had cared for her and saw death as more of a means of release/liberation rather than a punishment."
masskillers,fn8jpxm,t1_fn8if8i,1586743208.0,"The second one seems likely since he appeared to be very meticulous regarding what information he left behind, although I also believe there’s a chance that it could have been a combination of both of those theories."

depressed,fjzx2it,t3_ffm9qv,1583732395.0,All the time. We are expected to work in order to stay alive but I didn’t even ask to exist in the first place. It honestly feels like a sick joke.
masskillers,fjpzag3,t1_fjpr2nu,1583564062.0,I’m not sure but it looks like it could’ve been some kind of online friend he met through a true crime blog/forum.
masskillers,fjh7eiq,t1_fjgbfzf,1583342677.0,"I’ve had a similar experience with the mental health system (most of which were in my early teen years and I still was treated poorly despite my young age) and I am a woman. I believe mental healthcare as a whole is very underfunded leading to inadequate care and uneducated staff. I do believe there’s more of a stigma surrounding men seeking help but once you get it, it is pretty equally messed up for both genders (speaking from my own experience in psych wards and with psychiatrists, etc.)."

masskillers,fjdhj3c,t3_fcx05g,1583252849.0,They can’t do anything legally unless you’ve made a credible threat. You’ll be fine
Agoraphobia,fjbxybq,t1_fjbs31x,1583203890.0,I live with my family and yeah I agree. It’s definitely a social anxiety related issue.
Agoraphobia,fj8fexm,t1_fj8d0gt,1583112143.0,"They definitely notice. It’s become a bit of a taboo topic in my family and they just kind of pretend it isn’t happening. I don’t blame them, though. They’re unsure of how to help me but ultimately it’s up to me to seek help for myself, so I don’t hold them accountable for it."
masskillers,fj3ydf6,t3_fbbnl1,1582996035.0,"Eric Harris. Only because there were so many times that he left hints (he put an image of a bomb and the word “clue” on his wall and told his class about a dream he had about shooting people, asking for their input on what it meant) and it makes me think that there was a part of him that didn’t fully wanna go through with it. I know it’s controversial to say that he’s anything other than a psychopath but I fully believe he wanted to do it less than Dylan did. If he had been listened to and had gotten proper treatment I believe it could have possibly been prevented."

masskillers,fiv5r3n,t3_f9zfgs,1582754304.0,"If you’re meaning solely physical attraction, as others have stated, it’s probably the instinctual need to feel protected by their male counterparts and they might be attracted to the power dynamic. If it’s a genuine admiration for the killers (speaking from my own experiences) it could be that they feel connected to them in some way. Whether that be relating to their thoughts/opinions on life and morality, or just a general feeling of discontentment with their lives. That’s just my opinion, though."
depression,fij4hmm,t3_f82dz1,1582434478.0,Me too. Sometimes I wish that I had just never existed in the first place
dissolvedgirl,fi8gcos,t3_f6nbt7,1582239805.0,That’s heartbreaking. The guilt/regret passed onto those I love and care about has been the one thing keeping me here. I’m always torn between “well they actually don’t care so just do it” and “they’re going to be in pieces over this and you’re delusional if you think it won’t affect them” idk. I contradict myself a lot.
Columbine,fi27tmy,t3_f5l79o,1582073467.0,I was born in 2001 but I wish I grew up in the 90’s. It seemed like a cool time to be alive
lonely,fi27jt5,t3_f5wljl,1582073289.0,I’m 18 as well and don’t really have friends at the moment so I can relate. I spend the majority of my time completely alone. It kind of sucks but oh well
depression,fhfxiyx,t3_f2qwaw,1581553668.0,"Same. It’s hard for me to articulate my thoughts and when I do it’s usually just a jumbly, incoherent mess. I used to be decently well spoken but lately I’ve felt like an idiot who can barely form a proper sentence."
masskillers,fgyubw0,t3_f0pfcb,1581187115.0,Very well done. Thank you
depression,fgur7e1,t3_f0co0d,1581127557.0,I’m pretty sure I wasn’t meant to be here. I’m hoping whatever comes next will be a lot more peaceful.

SuicideWatch,fgk6o6c,t3_eysa2j,1580858630.0,"Honestly I’m a perfectionist and need everything I’m leaving behind to be perfect and exactly how I want to be remembered. So basically, I’m procrastinating my own death. Lmao. I’ve already begun planning out exactly how I wanna do it, so there’s that at least"
lonely,ffltx14,t3_eu5cgu,1580044160.0,"I relate to this so much. I wish I had a good piece of advice to give you but just know that you’re not alone in that feeling. That same issue has literally ruined my life. I dropped out of public school out of fear of being seen/judged. I hid in the bathroom and couldn’t walk through the halls without having anxiety attacks. I guess what I would say is if you’re able to, (and if you haven’t already) I would try to find a therapist/psychiatrist. Meds have literally saved my life more than anything else I’ve ever tried and I wish I had tried them sooner. I would get help if I were you before it escalates into something more unmanageable. It’s worth a try at least. I wish you the best, and if you ever need someone to talk to about it you can always message me."
depression,ffbknua,t3_esiopv,1579769896.0,That’s what I’m trying to figure out at the moment lol. I barely have the energy to brush my teeth in the morning even after 2-3 cups of coffee
insomnia,fedcy2s,t3_eokpff,1579007969.0,"I have the same problem. Even if I get less than 5 hours of sleep, I still won’t be able to fall asleep before at least 6 or 7am. Luckily my schooling isn’t until later in the day but it really does worsen my depression. I think I’m gonna start setting my alarm in the morning and forcing myself awake no matter how much I slept the night prior, so that hopefully I’ll start to fall asleep at normal hours again."
misanthropy,fecinem,t3_eoc99v,1578974841.0,"Agreed. It reminds me of the fact that the kardashians could easily pay to put the fire in Australia out, yet all they do is tweet about it and do absolutely nothing to help."
lonely,fd1kyyt,t3_ejpl77,1578132710.0,"All of the time. Mainly when listening to music, though."
masskillers,fd08es5,t3_ejmwa8,1578115176.0,Fascination and honestly borderline obsession. I plan to study criminology/psychology after high school because of it. There’s just something about humanizing what the media automatically paints as “evil” and “monstrous” that is so enthralling to me.
