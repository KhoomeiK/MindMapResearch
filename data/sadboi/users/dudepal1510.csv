gaming,fmsktzr,t1_fmsk0xt,1586357430.0,"Try the Petz series. Theyre these old PC games from the late 90s where you can adopt and breed cats(spelled ""Catz"") and dogs(spelled ""Dogz"") and it has a really impressive genetics system you can literally make new breeds of dogs and cats if you selectively breed them correctly. The games arent for sale anymore. I believe its considered Freeware nowadays. You'll have to torrent it but its so worth it. You can even find old websites still around today where you can download breeds not included in the games (wolves and bobcats, etc.)"
