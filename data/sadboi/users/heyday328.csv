I ended up in the ER being diagnosed as having a panic disorder and they immediately set me up with a therapy appointment. At that point I still didn‚Äôt connect the weed to the panic attack, I thought it was general anxiety and I just happened to have been high when it happened.


One of the first things my therapist said about weed was that there has been a huge uptick of anxiety cases since weed became legal (I‚Äôm in CA). He didn‚Äôt tell me I had to quit, and he didn‚Äôt blame the weed for my anxiety, but he just gave me the info so I was aware. It took a few weeks of pondering but I ultimately decided to quit. At my next appointment 2 weeks later, he was shocked to see how different my demeanor was. I told him that I stopped smoking weed and my anxiety was almost nonexistent.

I‚Äôve been clean for over 2 months now, and recently came off my anxiety meds. Looking back I probably never even needed them, I just needed to stop getting high. I know going to the ER for a weed-induced panic attack can be embarrassing, but it was a huge wake up call for me and it was the catalyst I needed to get better.

Just hang in there. Nowadays anytime I get cravings (especially now that I‚Äôm home all the time) I just remember the anxiety I felt and that rapid heart beat and chest tightness.

Anxiety,fkcj7fr,t3_fhnz9h,1584054222.0,"Just talk to your primary doctor and be honest. I was only recently diagnosed and was given a prescription for both Lexapro and Xanax. I didn‚Äôt even ask for the Xanax, but the doctor prescribed 12 pills just to have in case I feel a panic attack coming on. I‚Äôve only had to use it once thankfully, but just knowing I have it on hand has helped immensely.

Since you have a long history of anxiety and are already on meds, you most likely will not be seen as a drug seeker. Don‚Äôt be afraid to advocate for yourself!

ETA: If you are worried about mentioning it to your doctor, just let them know that you just want a low dose. My Xanax are 5mg, which is super low but also totally effective at curbing my panic attacks without making me feel any other effects."
Anxiety,fk10dpd,t3_ffw0vc,1583769949.0,"This is just my own anecdotal evidence, but my anxiety/depression decreased a LOT when I recently quit smoking weed. My therapist was aware that I used it, and he mentioned that since it became legal (I‚Äôm in CA) there‚Äôs been a strong correlation with people using it and having anxiety/depression. He didn‚Äôt blame *my* issues on it, he just mentioned the uptick. 

I quit almost 2 weeks ago on my own volition and for once I was actually excited to go to therapy because I felt I was making real progress.

But everyone is different. Some people can tolerate it well and others can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm one of the ones who can‚Äôt. Not because weed is *bad*, but because I love it so much that I cannot moderate my use and it caused me to become less motivated and tune out other important things in my life. Quitting released me from that burden. Being able to get shit done without the distraction of getting high has really improved my self esteem. I finally feel like myself again. But that‚Äôs just my experience.

ETA: I am also on Lexapro and quit weed about 4 weeks after starting it."

From the moment I told them I was pregnant, it was made clear that I got myself into this and it‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs responsibility but my own. I‚Äôm 28 now and I‚Äôm a great mom. It was hard, but learning to do the work and not rely on everyone else around me made me grow up and get my shit together. 

On the other hand, my cousin and his wife are about to have their second child while still living with my aunt and uncle. My aunt does ALL the childcare, she enables them, she makes it so they haven‚Äôt had to sacrifice anything. Hell, my cousin‚Äôs wife has told me that if it weren‚Äôt for my aunt, she couldn‚Äôt be a mom because it‚Äôs ‚Äútoo hard‚Äù...why she went ahead and got pregnant again is beyond me.

Your sister made her bed, she needs to learn that having a baby is a huge responsibility and she cannot expect anyone to pause their own life to help make her life easier."

It‚Äôs so annoying to have to go through this so many times. What usually happens is that I have to let myself hit bottom before I‚Äôm ready to stop. I have to get so fed up with it and angry with it before I feel truly ready to let it go. My current supply is running low and payday isn‚Äôt until Friday, so part of me just wants to finish it today so that I‚Äôll have no choice but to go without. I know I should just throw it away but there always that ‚Äúlast hurrah‚Äù mentality lurking in the back of my mind. I know how good it feels to quit and have a clear mind, but the thought of giving up a comfort is hard.

I also use weed as an escape mechanism, so basically I use it in order to procrastinate with other things. I *should* be studying for an upcoming test but if I‚Äôm stoned I can‚Äôt. I *should* be cleaning the house, but if I‚Äôm stoned I‚Äôll watch TV instead.

No one made me feel like I was wasting their precious time with a ‚Äúnon emergency‚Äù.

A piece of advice that I wish I could give to my younger self would be to continuously work on personal growth. Whether that means maintaining a healthy social life, self care, pursuing higher education, etc. I don‚Äôt regret being a young mom but I do regret the fact that I put myself on the back burner for years and waited until my daughter was school age before finally taking care of myself again. I know it seems impossible now, but even taking small steps is better than feeling totally stagnant.

It took me way too long, but eventually I enrolled at an online university and am working to finish my bachelors. I found a gym with child care so I could get a break from mom duties and get a workout in. I make plans to see friends, even if it‚Äôs just once a month.

I put off getting help for the same reasons. It wasn‚Äôt until I was at risk of losing my insurance that I realized I should really be taking advantage of being able to see a doctor without it costing tons of money. Just do it, you‚Äôll feel so much better once the appointment is scheduled, and even more so once you see a doctor and talk about your options. 

Depending on your insurance you could also have access to mental health services. I finally started seeing a therapist through mine and it has been massively helpful!
