depression,fcgemrj,t3_eh41bc,1577639211.0,"I feel exactly the same way, and have been told so many times that it isn’t true... at this point, if I isolated from everyone, I’m pretty sure I’d be the reason they won’t message cuz I’ve pushed people away so much when I’ve gone through a bad phase."

books,fc4m9g6,t1_fc4lmt9,1577420865.0,Aha yes exactly! Especially if they don’t really read so don’t understand. Just look at you like you’re insane!
books,fc4j4sk,t1_fc3w9t5,1577418161.0,"This. I love it when you’re so engrossed in a book that you hear all the different character voices and so clearly can imagine the scenes, pictures and feelings in your head. Almost like watching it happen rather than reading."
MMORPG,fc4iw51,t3_efs2am,1577417959.0,"I’ve recently quit Guild Wars 2. I played that game for 5 years+. My first pc game and mmorpg. I’ve hopped around different MMOs over past few months and honestly can’t find anything to fill the hole. I’m just waiting for the new ones, seems to be quite a few on the horizon..."
depression,fc4hobr,t3_efyc5z,1577416950.0,"Yes very relatable... not had a new crush in a while tbh, but a crush from before I was depressed I’m still very much obsessed with. Kind of just accepted nothing will happen and just wanna watch him be happy and live life."
depression,fbwfc4o,t3_eeqzyz,1577148427.0,"Writing this I’ve literally just blocked all my friends apart from my closest on discord where I get my only form of socialising... I can’t deal with it anymore, it’s too difficult. I go through phases where I just get so angry and they get the brunt of it. It’s not fair, but honestly I don’t think they truly want me around anyways. Just seems like pity, even though I get told otherwise I can’t get it out my head."

Thanks for the weird google search, I was also curious xd"
tifu,fbsbtp9,t1_fbrhrzf,1577053059.0,Why did I read that as “I wish you the best of fucks?” O.o
AskReddit,fbb4r1e,t3_eccwli,1576693280.0,"I’d tell her to follow her dream and when it goes bad don’t give up. She should also stand her ground and know she’s worth it. I’ll also make sure she knows what gaslighting is, and that she has to let go of loved ones if they’re hurting/abusing her in anyway."
endometriosis,fah1lby,t1_fah19qk,1576077031.0,"That’s good, I really hope it goes well and gets sorted!"
endometriosis,fah0ovq,t1_fafzyng,1576076396.0,I hope your daughter gets the treatment she deserves - just keep pushing for it and get another opinion/ask to be referred to a specialist maybe... it’s sad how many people are just pushed to the side without getting properly tested
endometriosis,fadmpyl,t3_e81ld7,1575979293.0,"Update: after going to the doctors, I’ve been put on Naproxen for the pain; and will have a scan and laparoscopy sometime next year. Happy that something is finally getting done, even though the doctor tried 1000 times to get me to just go on the pill again..."
endometriosis,facp9c4,t1_fab5rsb,1575944015.0,I’ve written all my symptoms down as I always forget stuff at the doctors. Thanks so much for all the information and well wishing! I hope you feel better soon and hopefully it keeps going well for you!

period,f8b5qah,t3_dzu81v,1574427840.0,Well since it’s getting in the way of life I wouldn’t say it’s normal... maybe go back to the doctors and push to be tested for endometriosis or something? Same happens to me but lasts 2-3 days with dizziness etc and I’m going to the doctor about it soon... trouble is it can be passed as normal so easily.
depression,f8b4xev,t1_f8aba8v,1574427051.0,Yeah know what you mean... I recently hesitated because I was worried I’d hurt the guy I was gonna date. He was a truly good person but I kept thinking it’s really not nice to be around me rn and I don’t want to cause someone mental illness like the past has caused me. Well now he turned his back on me for that hesitation and couldn’t understand my reason. Decided to forget about dating for a loooong time but still feel incredibly lonely and unloved. It’s shit.

depression,f86px37,t3_dzb1of,1574304070.0,"Relatable! I honestly don’t know why the friends that are still around put up with me... I am so irritable and can snap at anything! I never used to be like this and it just makes me want to isolate and feeds into my self-loathing. I just don’t know how to stop, I’m sometimes so worried to make new friends or hang out with people."
depression,f86nbi1,t3_dz9nrr,1574302372.0,"Yeah... I talk about my feelings and a lot is self-loathing, then they tell me otherwise but don’t understand I can’t just simply change the way I see myself or feel... just seems like a waste of time."
AskReddit,f86mp22,t3_dz4zvf,1574301956.0,I remember my brother moving his whole family upstairs apart the baby and blocking the doors from the social worker as well as deleting the stairs. It was... traumatic to watch xd The baby eventually got sucked through the walls into the social workers hands.
depression,f7xqduh,t1_f7xprph,1574069808.0,"Relatable... don’t go to 90% of uni classes because of it, don’t even know how to try and stop this cycle anymore."
depression,f7xpfmf,t3_dop83p,1574068353.0,"Late to the post but relatable... I’ve been skipping 90% of my classes because I don’t sleep, or I struggle with the simplest of tasks, or I don’t have the concentration, or I’m just struggling with all the thoughts and shit feelings... However, every time AFTER I’ve skipped, I feel even worse and guilty that I skipped. It’s gotten into a cycle now that I don’t even know what to do about it... Talk to my lecturer and hope I don’t get kicked out I suppose. I honestly don’t know how people keep going with work or studying etc, feeling like this."

AskReddit,eqtjfua,t3_bzhe09,1560312844.0,"For me, online gaming has helped an insane amount. The biggest thing that makes me socially anxious and introverted is judgement. Gaming allowed me to make friends and build confidence in talking to people without much judgement... plus the people of Guild Wars 2 are awesome! But irl... as said above by others - mainly it’s extroverted people carrying conversations and adopting me aha"
