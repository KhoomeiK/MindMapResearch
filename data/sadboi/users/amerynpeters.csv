Hozier,fmh8wvm,t3_fv095h,1586070736.0,NFWMB is my favourite Hozier song because of its references to ‚ÄúThe second coming‚Äù which is a poem by WB Yeats. Look it up. Also watch the video on YouTube where he discusses the song and how that poem influenced him

Dermatillomania,fhhknsh,t3_f37lp8,1581606337.0,Bro I don‚Äôt know what to tell you I did this through primary school but then moved on to other places like my scalp. So not exactly a good coping mechanism. Maybe try putting on your fingers that stuff they use to wean babies. It tastes awful.

ptsd,fg08zu0,t3_ew73dp,1580402796.0,"You think you‚Äôre doing well for those few months, but you aren‚Äôt. Just because your brain isn‚Äôt actively experiencing side effects do trauma doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs not still there and needs to be dealt with. If you go long enough pretending to be fine, you‚Äôll eventually believe it but your subconscious brain is like ‚Äúhuh uh honey you gotta deal with your trauma‚Äù and BAM it ends up in a dream, which forces you to once again confront it. It too me a few years in therapy before I learnt this."
