depression,fmbfetg,t3_fu4u39,1585925258.0,"i’m know exactly how you feel. my dog milo, he was six years old when his lungs suddenly collapsed and within two hours he was gone. my mum and dad were at his side trying to help him while i was in the waiting room. i could hear him struggling to breathe, he made this horrific cry in desperation and all i wanted to do was be at his side. i remember being called in and seeing his lifeless body, and all i could do was hug him. i spent the next thirty minutes hugging him while my dad left to get my siblings. for the rest of the night i cried and screamed, i did anything but could do nothing. i wanted nothing more than for my boy to be back with me. i did everything with him, if i was sad he would come cheer me up, i ate with him and shared my food, we slept in the same bed and we hunted together. losing him was like losing myself, i couldn’t do anything without crying. i would try to eat but it felt wrong without him by my side. for a while i wanted nothing more than to just stop living. 

even today i still cry at night despite it being two years ago. he was anything to me and i miss him so much. i have a new puppy now and i have dreams of him dying as well, i sometimes dream that he’s taken from me or he disappears. even two years on and i’m still recovering. 

idk if it’s going to get better or how long it will take, but i wish you all the best."

but my point is, is that it got better, i began to except his death and move on. i now have a beautiful puppy that helps me feel better. 

i hope you’re ok, i know how hard it is, and it took me a year to finally feel better about it. the thing that got me through it was the support and love from my friends and family, and if you need support or to talk, i am here to listen"

pls do not hurt yourself and do not make yourself sick, it’s important to take care of yourself. i want to help but i’m not sure how to. i’ve thrown up a few times bc of my weight and it always made me feel better but i told my mum and she helped my by making me healthier food so i didn’t feel guilty. 

but i don’t know how to deal with someone telling you to cut yourself, ive never been through that. just don’t listen to her"
depression,fltvue2,t3_fr5pz1,1585488767.0,"for me, i surrounded myself with friends who understood what i was going through and were there to support me. i also told my mum (which i know is really hard to do), i told her it wasn’t just being sad but i was considering committing suicide. after that my mum got me help, i saw doctors, therapists, social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists. i was on tablets and medication and i even went to the hospital at a point but eventually i began to get back on my feet and now i feel much happier. i still have my bad days and they’re still often, but now i can tell ppl and they will help me in anyway they can. i was one of the lucky ones who got treatment and made it out ok, although to this day i don’t think i deserved it. 

but if i were to suggest ways to deal: surround yourself with supportive friends, seek help and medical treatment and advice, as well as take care of yourself. i know you might not think you deserve it, to be loved and cared for, but you do. you are worth so much and you deserve to get better and feel better, and if you ever need to talk to someone who will support you, i will be more than happy to listen ^^"

yet still with all the support i found it so hard to work through my grief and for the first week i wanted to die to be reunited with him.

depression,flsddad,t3_fqquhp,1585439625.0,"omg i’m so sorry, i could never imagine what that must be like. i would be lost without my mother. i hope you’re ok.
it’s not the same but it was very devastating when my dog died. he was my best friend and we did everything together. we are together, hunted together and we slept in the same bed. he died really spontaneously, his lungs collapsed and within two hours he was gone. at first it felt unreal, like i was dreaming or imagining things, but i knew that was just grief. a week after his death i became more depressed than usual and considered suicide, but i got better and now if feel better. i still miss him of course and i still cry at night but i’m just happy for the memories i have of him. 
but i get that losing your mother is much worse and i’m really sorry. denial is one stage of grief and you will probably experience more. it’s important to stay close to your family and talk about it, but i understand not wanting to. 
if you find it too hard to talk about it to your family, i and the rest of this sub, are here for support, you can also vent to me and i will do my best to help.
i hope your ok"
