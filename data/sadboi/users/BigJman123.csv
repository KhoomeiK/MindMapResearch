Several months later I saw the physical copy at Gamestop for $30 and thought I'd be a cool addition to the collection. I started a new playthrough since I didn't want to jump right into my old save to try to beat the Hollow Knight boss after not playing for a while. I think I put 15ish hours into my second playthrough and for whatever reason I stopped for a second time.

Jump to 8ish months later (about 1 month ago)and I bought a Switch. I got a bunch of games for it, one being Hollow Knight. I have yet to start my third playthrough but when I do, hopefully I can finally get through this damn game. Lol"
