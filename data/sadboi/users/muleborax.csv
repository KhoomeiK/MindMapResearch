I do have to agree Krakauer's sympathy for him, as a fellow outdoorsmen, borders on idolization. Many others have followed that train of thought, so much so that they have died trying to follow Chris's footsteps. 

The narrative around his character seems to fall into two camps: either he's a complete idiot who deserved his fate, or a revolutionary saint. As is the case with anybody, he isn't solely either. He had an idealistic view of being in nature and humanity, he himself idolized problematic writers who wrote about immersion in nature without actually being off-the-grid (ie. not true isolation in Thoreau's Walden), and made very foolish choices to make his journey needlessly more difficult.

This is a sharp reduction on the 1.5 mb/d annual pace seen in the past 10-year period. Following a difficult start in 2020 (-90 kb/d) due to the coronavirus, growth rebounds to 2.1 mb/d in 2021 and decelerates to 800 kb/d by 2025 as transport fuels demand growth stagnates.
Oil demand growth slows because demand for diesel and gasoline nears a plateau as new efficiency standards are applied to internal combustion engine vehicles and electric vehicles hit the market.""

In recent years, there has been a dramatic cultural shift in attitudes towards environmentalism and sustainability, as well as greater consumer demand for companies compliant with such ideals, a growing body of research and evidence about climate change and consensus amongst climate scientists, growing investment in renewable energy, and lastly government policies enacted globally to reduce carbon emissions and providing subsidies to those who mitigate their impact.

For argument's sake, let's say the oil industry is booming and will continue to for the foreseeable future. Any industry regularly goes through booms and busts, as is part of the business cycle.

period,fje4idd,t3_fcwfpw,1583265083.0,"My periods were so bad they were making me severely anemic, and I was taking painkillers that are used for minor surgeries. Going on the pill helped with pain and making my flow lighter. They eventually stopped helping me, and I switched to a Mirena IUD which has done wonders, as it has stopped my period entirely."

alberta,fje17xg,t3_fcvec0,1583263230.0,"This harms the environment, the people working and employed by the parks, and the revenue generated from tourism. There has been nothing done by he UCP that doesn't make my blood boil."

alberta,fja3qkc,t1_fja1rjx,1583165752.0,"Exactly! By ensuring people are healthy and taken care of, whether through access to health care, safe drinking water, lead abatement etc you have many more who are now contributing to the workforce, increasing productivity and tax revenue. If only more conservatives thought like your dad"
alberta,fj9me91,t3_fc7pv7,1583153590.0,"Several years ago, my old town had such a small doctor to patient ratio, many people were going without care and incredibly long wait times. It's what happens when you relentlessly cut health care and hurt those providing the care. Then last year, in a public economic policy class I brought that up, and a conservative classmate responded ""well, maybe that's the problem with public health care"". The solution shouldn't be privatizing care so it becomes inaccessible to many who need it, but to stop the cuts and tax breaks for huge executives. Help the people who elected you."

Dalhousie,fiywqbm,t3_fab5ko,1582848710.0,Reminds me of a certain cell biology professor. Academics who have an elitist attitude because of the difficulty of their field make terrible teachers.
alberta,fiywdof,t3_fadmsc,1582848473.0,"Greta is a child, and having her in a sexual, and degrading manner is disgusting. It’s shameful that some people are so endlessly dedicated to oil and gas that they would produce and distribute a sexual drawing of a child they disagree with."
DAVIDsTEA,fiskz6y,t3_f9kocc,1582686890.0,"there are sets of the most popular teas, which give you small samples before you delve into buying a large one. Personally I really like saigon and kashmiri chai, especially with almond milk. On the website, you can also search specific flavours (i.e.. cardamom, bergamot, etc) and it will generate a list of teas with those ingredients."
antidepressants,fikrf9h,t1_fikr0pq,1582485846.0,"Maybe try extending the period just a little bit, taking it earlier in the morning so there isn't so much in your system at once. In the summer when I started combining wellbutrin with cipralex I had horrible insomnia, and taking half a sleep aid occasionally helped, and then it eventually went away after a couple weeks."
antidepressants,fikqjnp,t3_f8agsp,1582485354.0,"When do you take the wellbutrin? I was recommended by my pharmacist and doctor to take the first does in the morning, and the second does about 8 hours later, but no later than 5 pm. I found that when I would take my second dose at night of 150mg SR I would have terrible insomnia, but taking it earlier helped a lot."
alberta,fikq8fp,t1_fik2f74,1582485189.0,"I've worked at two locations and both were horrible. Managers are *obsessed* with drive thru times, so much so that one of my managers would hit my arm if I was working cash at the window and the time was above 18 seconds (even though the time was the responsibility of 4+ other people as well). Being verbally abused by customers who take out their bad day on you, managers not doing anything when nightshift is understaffed, in general being treated as disposable or a machine for profit, and the quality of the food and coffee is dogshit. I don't understand why so many people are obsessed with it, and moreso why it's so ingrained to our idea of patriotism."
