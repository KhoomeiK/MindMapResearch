findapath,fr1bcbc,t1_fr17jr2,1589816718.0,"I certainly hope I didn't offend your beliefs. In my post I was sure to include ""let's say it does matter"" for all you believers out there. I'm not a jerk atheist, just a man of science. 

I'm not going to pretend I'm some guru that has all the answers, because I'm not and I don't. Merely months ago I was a typical young adult worried about my future. Well actually, it's been nearly a year now. 

To answer your question, yes, I did have a path to a career in life. I was going to become a doctor, specifically in neuro musculoskeletal treatment. I took all the right classes, had excellent looking scores on the MCAT, and became close with doctors in my area. I followed every single step. Then, one day I woke up and started panicking. I was about to commit to something so long term and permanent that I'd never really have the chance to get out for 15-20 years. I had a minor psychotic break and realized that medicine, no matter how noble, no matter how qualified I might be for it, was not right for me. I threw away my admission letters. 

After some digging, I realized it was because I just dont have the inner ambition to commit to any one thing. In any aspect of life. I have no interest in marrying, having children, or limiting myself to a single area of study or work. I like learning and doing everything, but not more than playing video games and watching TV with my family. I also don't have the drive to finish any long term creative projects. Writing a novel was my other ""dream."" Now, I just want peace and quiet, to be left alone. 

The world is far too dark a place for any one person to save; I know that now. So instead, I make it brighter for myself and anyone else who wants the same."
findapath,fr15j7u,t1_fr10xsl,1589813656.0,"You have to decide what you can tolerate and what you value in life. All I can do is tell you the truth. One day you'll.die and it won't matter what you did. At all. It won't matter if you stacked fruit for 50 years or if you cured cancer for us all. You will be gone. 

And eventually, the human race will be gone too. Then Earth, followed eventually by all the light in the universe. So, it truly doesn't matter. 

But let's say it did matter. Do you want to be the kind of person that looks down on a man for stacking fruit? Or do you want to be the kind of person that chooses to be happy every day with what you have in life? Because I know how the latter story ends. It ends with you chasing things or people or money, to fill the hole inside your chest, but you'll realize too late that the hole is far too deep to fill. When you get ready to die, you'll look around at all the shiny things you own and all you'll be thinking is that you wish you had more time for the experiences you loved in life. 

I don't mean to be pessimistic or cynical and I certainly don't want to add to any depressive feelings you may be having. Actually, it's quite the opposite, I'm very hopeful for you. Here, lett me make my point as clear as possible. To quote the famous pirate Captain Jack Sparrow:

""The only rules that matter are these: what a man can do and what a man can't do.""

So, what can't you do? :)"
findapath,fr0dl54,t3_glryn6,1589791834.0,"Hello, friend, I want you to know that I sympathize with you and I’ve been where you are right now. In fact, I’m still there now. Perhaps you’ll dismiss what I’m about to say like the many times I did when I was feeling like you do now, or maybe you won’t, either way I come bearing good news. 

Your life, the way it is now, and who you are now, are both perfectly fucking fine things. 

That’s right, you read it right, you’re doing just fucking fine and you don’t need to feel stressed or anxious or pissed off at yourself. Why?

Because the only fucking reason you’re upset is because you’ve put unrealistic expectations on yourself based on a combination of factors:

1. Societal expectations, norms, and entrainment. 
2. A perceived lack of both skill and ambition. 
3. Human restlessness brought on by a need for constant change and challenge to produce the necessary chemicals that make you feel good. 

These mean nothing, here’s why in order: 

1. You aren’t anyone else and you never will be, the opinions of others regarding how you live your life have no value. 
2. You are going to die. So is Michael Jordan, Bruno Mars, the Disney Heiress, and even Spongebob. So, skill and ambition literally have no value beyond a roof over your head and food in your belly. 
3. Human Beings are nomadic creatures build for accomplishing tasks related to survival. With the level of comfort you experience now, your body is suspicious of you and is deciding that you need to accomplish more in order to live. Couple that with our social side and natural biological competitiveness, and boom, manic depressive person. 

So, knowing all of these INDISPUTABLE FACTS, what are you options? 

Whatever you fucking want them to be. I’m 27 years old and I live with my parents. I have maybe $1000 to my name. I play video games all night long and sleep during the day. When they need me to do stuff, I do stuff. I eat good food. I watch good TV. I make friends online and I even date (yes, really, and 4 times out of 10, my lack of ambition gets me laid). I take care of myself and I sleep soundly. My life is good. Just starting Fire Emblem: Three House Chapter 5 after I just blocked someone from logging into my Apple ID. What could be better than this? 

I’m like you. I want nothing badly enough to work for it. One day, perhaps(and hopefully in the distant future), I’ll need to face the ugly truth that I’ll have to work and save and provide for myself. When that happens, I’ll have my survival instincts to rely on. I’ll get a reasonable job and work reasonable hours doing whatever I need to to put a roof over my head and food in my belly, and certainly some internet in my computer. 

And you? What will you do? What do you like doing with your free time? Breathe and enjoy the sunshine on your face and the wind in your hair. We must decide what truly has value for ourselves. There is the reality I have presented to you, and the reality that you must build for yourself. Why not illustrate a few times a month through fiver or upwork. I was a freelancer for a long time myself. It may seem slow and not worth much, but five years from now you’ll have a portfolio and contacts. Or don’t. Watch Anime and rub one out. Eat frozen pizza and hug your mom at breakfast every morning. Do you want a family of your own? Want kids? Get a decent job doing anything and make it happen. 

Point is. Nothing matters, my friend. I’ve just given you the lens of freedom, the truth, and all you have to do is look through it and see for yourself. Life is good once you learn to just. let. go. 

Good luck. I wish you well."

Hell, I'd say we could probably be better showrunners than most currently employed in Hollywood. There are two reasons for this:

1. Extroverted writers with connections get the best jobs. Add to that a popular minority skin color or orientation, and boom, you've got mediocre storytelling that was fabricated from socializing and general bullshitting.  

2. In the gaming industry, writers are rarely just writers. In order to save money on big budget projects, more often than not, storyboard teams are built from existing staff members with some occasional consulting contractors brought in to the foray. These people are often gifted in graphics or IT fields, of course, but they mistake their familiarity with a genre for writing ability. You see the same thing with the vocally talented believing they can write great songs. It's a different skill entirely. 

Put simply, ideas are cheap and the only things that matter in life are: who you know and what results you get. Loud, unintelligent people are often easier to hear over the soft voices of the truly gifted."

Once you accept that, it hurts less. The friendships you make after that, however shallow, are less stressful.

But many on this sub (and other groups like it), tend to express their childfree lifestyle with hostility and judgment towards others who are not childfree or do not fit into some personal definition of what that means. 

At its core, being childfree just simply means living a life without children in it. Period. That being said, people rarely live in reality or textbook definitions like we do. Hence the debate about how many genders there are, the supposed wage Gap, and of course racial justice. 

People simply cannot handle what is real. The next time you end up in an argument with someone, ask yourself two questions first.

You made the right call to end things the first time (in my opinion with my limited knowledge of your relationship). Sometimes being childfree means being a serial dater. Sometimes it means stretches of being alone. Regardless, in your current situation, take heart in knowing there is nothing you can do.

joi,fozmsl3,t3_gafxlz,1588193277.0,"My opinion may not reflect the interests of other JOI enthusiasts, but I’ll share it with you nonetheless. 

I’m a big fan of hypnosis and edging in all aspects of sex. In the real world and in the virtual world. So, my biggest dealbreaker is any content under 20 minutes, and personally I prefer sessions to be in the sweet spot of 40-50 minutes. Of course, that’s just me, and I only added that so you can cast a wide net for joi lovers with your final product. Below I’ll outline some key areas you don’t want to miss for all joi lovers:

1. The dirty talk is only especially important for certain kinks. For example, anything step-incest related would need dialogue naturally, and you’re right, eventually that will become tired and break immersion. How do you get around this? With insanely hot artwork and other visuals. That way, you make up for the dialogue being repetitive with quality. Men are visual creatures, 9 times out of 10, visual trumps audio. 

2. Make the joi challenging. Many people turn to joi because they like the added interactivity and challenge of earning a release. As I’m sure you know, most men can get themselves off way faster than any woman could ever hope too. We practice. A lot. So it’s important to have a VARIETY of different tasks, choke points, and challenges designed to make people fail. This also alleviates some of the hiccups associated with your initial concerns as well. A lot of joi lovers WANT to fail. When something is too easy, it becomes a chore. If you want longevity, up the difficulty. 

3. Include a range of kinks. I’m a pretty vanilla guy and I’m definitely not a submissive. Thing is, a lot of joi lovers are, or at least switchy as hell. Kinks to include would be:feet, ageplay (careful on this), yandere, tsundere, ass, tits, and Domme. Just to start of course. I’m sure you knew this as well, but I figured I’d mention just in case. There’s also a huge market for SPH and CBT. Though, I’m not sure why, I don’t judge. 

4. Returning to the issue of dialogue (I’m an erotic scriptwriter and was a freelance writer for years), avoid the overuse of phrases within a several minute window. Cum can be: load, seed, milk, essence, whatever you want. The quality and novelty of the dialogue is more important than than the repeated session burnout. Trust me on this. 

5. A final note: Avoid any phrases or acts that create separation between the dialogue and the joi lover. At its core, joi is about intimacy and surrender. While these are submissive traits, we all experience the need for them at some point. Use active voice, imply meaningful relationships exist unless the kink specifically conflicts with this. 

All in all, joi lovers aren’t a hard crowd to please, but they consume content so voraciously that if you want to make money/earn retention, you have to play to quality. I’m sure you’re doing just fine. Don’t overthink it! Good luck, my friend."

My dad is an atheist and my mom is a Christian. My girlfriend is a DEVOUT Christian. And I am non-religious. We almost just broke up over kids and quite frankly, she's the best thing to ever happen to me. 

There is probably no group (outside of certain cultures) more pressured into motherhood than the one you belong to. Christian and female. Everyone has an opinion for you and they all seem to know what's best.


 Trust. Your. Gut. 

You know what you need better than anyone else. 

Now, a little annoying info you didn't ask for. Certain Slime Molds (yes like actual mold) have actually been proven recently to selectively evolve through loners. These ""loners"" are roughly 30% of the population and they often avoid social congregation in large numbers and tend to avoid extreme starvation behaviors that the others participate in. Scientists think it's to preserve the social ability to reproduce in the event that a species makes a terrible evolutionary decision. 

You asked why you feel this way. I think it's scientific, but you might not. Either way, just like the weird ass disgusting slime molds, human beings have variation. We have an insane amount of variation that can only come with intelligence. 

You aren't wrong. You aren't unholy. You aren't a selfish ass bad person (even though there's nothing wrong with that). You just don't want to procreate because you want different things out of life. 

My advice? Talk with your husband. Really ask him why he thinks his life will be enhanced by children. Go through the pros and cons and hear him out if you really want to save the relationship. Then state your case very firmly as you always have. I did this with my girlfriend and helped her realize that her family and faith was pressuring her into doing this. She comes from a traditional Mexican family that's very devout. She realized that she only enjoys very small children and would rather get contact through another method such as Big Sisters or being a Daycare worker. She wants her own life. You do, too. 

Fight for love or don't. Either way. Welcome to the side of the fence that gets to sleep. Glad to have you."

But regarding the medical field and your insight on that, I agree. I'm trying to discover if I have it in me to push through more medical training. I completed a self paced Medical Assistant program in three weeks that was designed to be six months in length. I don't say this to brag, but to show just how little I can stick with things. I forced all that education down as quickly as possible and got certified so I didn't have to do anything else. 

Either way, I feel like I'm going to need to develop some tolerance for the mundane."

From there. You can have innumerable versions of success that far outweigh any risk of failure. The very worst thing we can do with our lives is nothing. 

So, make a smart plan to reduce the risks of whatever you endeavor to do and then do it. Death will come for you eventually. What story will you have to tell him?"

I've worked as a Freelance Writer for the last five years. I worked for a digital marketing firm known as Coalition Technologies as a steady source of work while I used content boards to gather more clients. I have written so much SEO my brain can't handle even one more keyword research session. I'll literally die. 

Thanks for your kind words and I appreciate the about out regarding digital marketing. It's a good fit for some people, and for a while it was for me, too. I simply don't have the drive necessary to make good money doing this. The trick is setting up effective funnels for affiliate marketing on a blog you build from scratch. The problem is, it takes so long to build readership and network with other bloggers (I despise social media) that I was spending more time working on relationships than actually writing. It's all very disingenuous to me.

depression,fkthtoi,t3_fklt2j,1584520465.0,"I suffer from this daily. Professionals have called it Anhedonia, or the absence of pleasure. I would never presume to diagnose you, of course, I am only sharing what has occurred in my own life. 

Anhedonia is a symptom of depression and a rather nasty one at that. If that is what you suffer from (talk to a professional, it can't hurt!), it can be a challenge to re-engage with life. 

What works for me generally is:

1. Exercising every single day. Yes, every day. I know it sucks, bro. 
2. Eating some fruit and veggies/limiting copious amounts of sugar and caffeine. Also sucks at first, bro. 
3. Engaging with your community (i.e. helping others). I'm an introvert and I'm guessing you are too, so this one MEGA SUCKS, bro. It gets easier, though!
4. Setting small, attainable goals that society deems ""worthy"" of pursuit. This can be anything from physical fitness to getting more education, etc. You may not care about anything enough to want to try new stuff, but sometimes it can really help. 

Anhedonia robs us of our pleasure in life. The things we used to enjoy feel dull or empty. Eventually, it becomes easier to simply stare at a stimulus and not move. If it's safe to do so, get some fresh air. Breathe it in and sit outdoors for thirty minutes a day. Unplug from everything. Just feel your own breath and smile. Even if you aren't happy. It's amazing what a little change of perspective can provide for us."
depression,fkthcjd,t3_fklu7s,1584519838.0,"There's no way to get an accurate diagnosis on a forum, though I'm sure you know that. 

What I will say is that I suffer from this every day. Mine is a form of performance anxiety. Sometimes, it gets so bad that I will even do the exact opposite of whatever I've been told. It has kept me from maintaining jobs where I need to interact in person and it has made me an overly anxious driver. I live rurally partially because of this. 

Now, I'd never give you advice over a forum as I'm not a professional and even if I was I wouldn't be able to accurately get the full picture. But, what professionals have told me (specifically regarding my case) essentially amounts to this: ""You need exposure therapy, practice doing the things that give you anxiety. Then slowly introduce things that cause your episodes in a safe environment. If that doesn't work after a sufficient amount of time, we can try medications."" 

It didn't work for me and I refuse to medicate. So, this is my life, but you should absolutely see a professional and describe this to them. It couldn't hurt, right?"
depression,fktgvlt,t3_fkjk9d,1584519238.0,"I see your words and guess what? You are really cool, too. 

People don't choose who they love it just happens. You find someone attractive, you enjoy their behavior, their sense of humor, their seeming willingness to listen to you and be there for you. 

But the reality is that people are often disappointing in a society that praises monogamy and pairing off. There's nothing wrong with those who enjoy it, but there's also nothing wrong with loving yourself more. 

I have chosen a life of solitude because there is no one person on this earth that could ever live up to the standards I have set for myself. You say people use you and move along. You say you choose the wrong people. But did you enjoy their company while it lasted? Do you have fond memories of them? If so, then be happy in those memories. If not, learn to love your own company. Make some memories with yourself.

I don't know your life, I don't know what makes you happy or sad. All I know is that when I defeat my depression, it is through realizing my own worth every day. I am the only person on the planet that will love me as much as I desire. I rock. You do, too. 

You want to know what the best part of all of this is? I am here, reading your words, and I can tell that you have so much to give to the world. There is love in your post that makes me smile and think of the person you must be. If I like you already, why can't you like yourself?:)"

I want to say something to you that will make you stop hurting, something that will fill that huge festering hole in your chest, but there's nothing. People will stop by from time to time and say various positive phrases that they use a million times a day with everyone. Maybe some of them truly do care, but most don't.   


The reality is this: we are all born to die. That is the ""meaning of life."" It isn't fancy, it isn't pleasant, and it sure as shit doesn't make us wanna keep fighting. Yet, there is beauty in it. There is something special and exotic that grows in the darkness of the human spirit. There is a war being waged between life and unlife that many of us just sit by and ignore every day. You are on that battlefield right now, kid. You exist in a place between happiness and despair. 

Now, what are you going to do about it? Do you just lay over and die? Do you deny yourself the many pleasures of this world for a single moment in time that will pass? Do you rot in your own sorrow or do you scream into that empty void, demanding satisfaction from a world that will watch your life come and go? 

Dig into the darkness and fucking ***SHRIEK*** back into. Let all know that you do not die easily and you will ***NOT*** go quietly.

Thirdly, when you get out of that shitty school things are going to get much better. Not only because you can simply walk away from people like that, but because you can choose the places to be.
