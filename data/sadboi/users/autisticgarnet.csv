butchlesbians,fgy3zo3,t3_ezi2vf,1581179265.0,"As a kid, I had a lot of dolls and stuff, but I would always get bored with them *very* quickly - I was always more interested in hands-on science toys, but I never asked for those because I was always afraid my mom would think I was ""weird"".

And in the fourth grade, one girl told me that my clothes weren't ""stylish"" or ""trendy"" enough and that other kids were going to laugh at me, so I tried to get more feminine clothes just so I wouldn't get bullied.

My worst fear as a kid was having no friends or being thought of as ""weird"", so I hid my true self."

I started to become depressed when I was 12, and I even started to self-harm and think about suicide often when I was 16.  I attempted it twice after graduating from high school.  After my second attempt, I had be hospitalized, and when I was discharged I felt a sense of joy and pride in being autistic.

I had to unlearn a lot of internalized ableism to get to where I am today."

I‚Äôm pre-T, but I don‚Äôt have periods anymore because my testosterone is already high due to the PCOS.  When I *did* have periods in my early teens they were so painful sometimes they made me throw up.

I started gaining weight when I was about 19, and a year later I was diagnosed with PCOS.  Around this time I also started to question my gender, and later I started to identify as a nonbinary and transmasculine person."

depression,exfldme,t1_exfk9zw,1566243092.0,"1. In first and second grades, the principal of my special ed school had the fire alarm go off on purpose almost every day to get the students used to the noise, and it was traumatizing because the alarm was a buzzer, and I can‚Äôt stand buzzers.  Once in first grade I covered my ears to block out the noise and my teacher took my hands off my ears and said, ‚ÄúHands down!‚Äù

2. In the third grade I went to a new school, where I was mercilessly bullied because I was always paranoid about the fire alarm going off.  Some kids even shoved me to the ground and snatched off my glasses.

3. In high school, I went to yet another special ed program.  This one was probably my worst experience because if you stepped even one foot out of line you might get physically restrained by school staff.  I got restrained many times, and because I‚Äôm autistic and hate being touched without consent, it was always agonizing."
