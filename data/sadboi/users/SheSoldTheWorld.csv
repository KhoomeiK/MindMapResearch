I'm truly interested in what made you masturbate at the age of ten.

Even though it is a taboo, really small and developing children are developing their sexuality too, and they touch themselves, get aroused, etc. But many times this sexual behavior can get out of hand (like having sexual behaviors in public for example) and they are usually attributed to sexual abuse.

But sadly there's not much further information about children's sexuality, is like the science behind the mind is restrained by taboos, which is somewhat ironic."
