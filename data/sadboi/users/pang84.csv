Anxiety,fmsl5uj,t3_fwm9rl,1586357607.0,You dont necessarily have to have anxiety to analyze and obsess it can happen if you are an introvert aswell.
Anxiety,fmsjkee,t1_fltwn5i,1586356739.0,"Yeah it can be that also, and its so difficult to focus on something else when all you are feeling is uncomfortable feelings.

I wish you all the best in overcoming this."
Anxiety,fljwbx3,t1_fl4y087,1585228341.0,"I feel a bit better and started walking to college and to friends. My anxiety is more symptoms than thought because i feel lightheaded everyday (which increases and decreases during the day) and can feel easily hot or like my temperature is more on the hot side and fatigue,low stamina etc.  The feeling of faint comes from my symptoms which makes me believe that i can faint but i havent fainted from anxiety yet. I always try to convince myself that i wont faint but when it occurs the only thing going through my mind is to escape it.

Whenever the fainting spell strikes it really scares me and i am afraid of it to be honest and it doesnt always happen only sometimes. 

For me the fainting spell can only happen when i go to places, but when i go to places with a family memeber it doesnt occur. It also doesnt happen when im at home(probably the comfort zone). 

I  will suggest you try and convince yourself that you wont faint and also believe that it wont happen.


I hope this can help you and wish you all the best in overcoming this."

Anxiety,fkffq44,t3_fi5wdi,1584133395.0,"I feel similar to what you are feeling at times and im also not sure if i will faint or not, but ive read that if you have anxiety your blood pressure increases which makes it irrelevant to fainting because if you were to faint your blood pressure should decrease."
Anxiety,fkabs5c,t1_fk7ve4l,1584000694.0,Nope. When i feel dizzy i know its a symptom of anxiety so therefore i tell myself nothing will happen. Most of the time its the symptoms that make me anxious.
Anxiety,fk7udrp,t1_fk7nl9m,1583943803.0,Lightheadedness was always a symtom for me since i started feeling anxiety but like a month or two ago my anxiety worsened and the symptoms also got worst keeping me housebound at times.
Anxiety,fk7czv9,t1_fk7a0wv,1583933779.0,"I went to a doctor like a month ago and she only told me that my blood pressure is too high for my age(20), i dont know the reading of my blood pressure that day but the lightheadedness could be related to blood pressure."

Anxiety,fgi1sx0,t1_fggtzbe,1580801647.0,"Its also said that if its anxiety your blood pressure increases which results in you not being able to faint, because if you were too faint your blood pressure should decrease, but the sensations and feelings feel so real you believe it really will happen.

Anyway thanks for your help."
Anxiety,fgd2j8q,t3_exuw3g,1580678372.0,"Im 20 year old male also quite lonely and bored and do things like play video games(not every day), scroll the internet, watch tv mostly football especially weekends.

I havent been out to the malls in like a year and a half and not went to the pools or beach since january 2018. This is not because i cant go but more like i dont  want to go because i have anxiety.

Im not diagnosed from a doctor to state that i have anxiety ,but instead i diagnosed myself since ive been feeling like this since may 2018"

Thanks for your help though and i definitely have to prepare myself because im not sure if it will happen"
Anxiety,fgcx4i0,t1_fgctram,1580677035.0,"Yeah it does suck  and it probably is the worst anxiety that i can feel. It used to happen like every other month until a couple weeks ago it happened when i went to cut my hair and the barber wasnt there, which requires me to walk to the barber and is quite a distance from my home not far though.

Since that day on it left some kind of fearful feeling and its been 4 weeks since that day and still i havent got a haircut but hopefully i can get one tomorrow."

It wasnt like the way it is now, it usually happened once in a while but now the other day(4 weeks ago) i felt it and since that day i feel it alot basically anywhere i go to even at places it wouldnt usually occur."
