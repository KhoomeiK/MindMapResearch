Greysexuality,fpl5gzs,t3_gdz5za,1588706713.0,"Is this an anger relating cutting , Dissociation , or maybe overwhelming feelings of perhaps sadness or anxiety? Maybe Guilt?

These can often be healthily redirected out word not in the form of anger towards people but exercises , journaling , lots of crying , talking about it , drawing , drawing on skin, and allow to take your emotions outwards rather than inward.

It’s hard to help someone , you can maybe only stop them from hurting themselves at the moment and making sure they stay grounded in the moment and the now. Grounding exercises involve making the person be aware of their 5 senses. 

Don’t take it all on yourself, it’s okay if it’s a lot. Direct them to the right ressources and professionals that can actually help them."
