concertphotography,fpgckj6,t3_gd3vd1,1588599867.0,"I‚Äôm not seeing a subject or a theme in this shot. What are you trying to say with this shot?

For me, from this angle the photo falls a little flat. The singer is sideways, the drummer is straight on and it feels like you were standing straight on while you shot. It also seems like this was shot at a lower shutter speed, it‚Äôs a little bit of blur/out of focus. Try ramping up the shutter speed and pause time or slow it down for more motion in the shot.

Try bringing some dynamics into the shot, stand further to the left and get some depth added to the shot. Get a little lower, focus on a subject like tight shots of one person, full band or stacking them behind each other.

Move around the whole venue, snap a few off and do it again."
