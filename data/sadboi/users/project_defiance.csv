MechanicAdvice,fp8ud7t,t3_gbz6vv,1588403290.0,"There’s a few ways to go about it. If you’re dedicated to keeping that machine face and look, buy a new wheel, or forget it ever existed, paint and repair will look different and fade over time. 

That being said this could be a great opportunity to change the color of your wheels. If you get the wheel repaired you could ask to switch all your wheels to black, bronze, gold, whatever. This way all the wheels will match and even if paint starts to fade in the distant future the curb rash will remain hidden."

Having a panhard bar is a good idea if you’re looking for more serious off-roading, but not required, but you’ll get a lot more steering float and play especially as things wear in. Depending on how stiff those springs are, how much highway driving you’re doing, and how wide the tires are, it may be a good idea to add a sway bar. But I would get it together and drive it first, see how you like it. If it rolls too much then I’d add one. But I don’t think you need one to start"

Even though we were just on the phone she started losing comprehension pretty quick after that. She fell asleep on the phone with me, and I could hear her breathing, then start struggling for air, stop breathing, then choke, which thankfully woke her up. She said the word ""hug"" and the call ended. Tried calling back repeatedly to no answer. I knew her roommate was gone, and had no idea if anyone was checking on her. I ended up having to call the police for a wellness check. Led to a few intense arguments the next couple days and we are no longer friends. Fun times"

With Murder you dont have to live through it, your life is over, even if it is a painful death you get released in the end. But in many rape and sexual assault cases, the victim has to live through being violated and taken advantage of in one of the worst ways possible. Many victims never talk, and most offenders are never caught or even recognized. There are many walking around who still have to see their abusers, and others who are trapped living with an abuser. It destroys your mental state and affects every aspect of your life moving forward. Fear, worthlessness, anxiety become a normal part of your existence, and the idea that it's your fault and that'll itll happen again will consume many, leaving them as a shell of what they once were, but still alive.
