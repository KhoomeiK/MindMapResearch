Regardless, it’s really difficult to try and get better and practice in norms when your entire progression and your sharing of knowledge is overshadowed by “it’s just norms”, all the way into plat. It’s a shit mentality and can ruin a lot of fun learning opportunities...across all elos.

We create strong bonds often with the production and design teams we work with and typically find really good ways to help each other and confide in one another. And since the show runs are relatively shorter than a full time job, it seems as though we have a distancing or minor detachment from a 9 to 5. But unless you’re doing shop work you are working 9 to 5 building: but even there it’s a very warm and welcoming place.
