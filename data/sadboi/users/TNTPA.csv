blender,fr46yit,t3_gmkr32,1589877994.0,"This is from a week ago, ment to post it earlier

I used empties to deform the ground mesh, ik I should've used dynamic paint though. 

I had a quick question about constraints (this project had a lot of firsts and this was one of them) the piston setup I have frequently glitches throughout the animation and I have nonclue why. In thd Viewport it's completely fine, happens in both eevee and cycles. I should also mention it works viewport render mode to.

Another question I had was with weight painting and rigging. I initially tried to set-up and armature but I have up because when I tried to weightpaint the leg, it would never become completely red. Instead I opted to just parent and move the origins to the joints, which ik is not the way you're supposed to do it.

Last thing, is there a way to add self collision between a wire (curve) and a mesh when the former is hooked to the latter.

Thanks for your help! A little bit of self promotion: I use Instagram as the main place I keep all my work - I have an artstation and dribbble but don't use them as much. My handle is @donk.stuff in case you were considering following."

But there was one big issue when I was adding the grating, I couldn't find a good wire texture that worked well, so I literally made the grating and copied it in - made it super intensive and laggy because there were waayy too many verts (I tried sheepit and it said 34.6 GB of memory needed). I ended up reducing the grating to only where you could see it. Is there anyway I can bake their position or turn them into a texture to make it better (like polgyon has their 3d modeled textures). 

Other than that, any and all feedback is well appreciated.

Thanks!

The watermark was actually my friend's idea, I think it looks great and I'm gonna try and do it more for my future posts.

Any suggestions for a subject/focus? I'm probably going to make the entire thhing more cyberpunk -esque for my next post/render (while I try to figure out what to work on next). I'm open to anything, also, what do you think about adding some fog?
