And I’m just now wondering if my general dislike of seafood comes from this! Because I used to love fish and chips and things like that before! And I’ve only just really started to eat seafood again from eating sushi! It’s weird though, because if for example there’s prawn pasta I can eat the pasta (as long as it’s not to fishy tasting) as long as I don’t eat any part of the prawn, and if I do I start feeling sick, like I even find the texture of prawns to be disgusting not just the taste and smell.

EatingDisorders,fq5kgms,t3_ggz4nu,1589108818.0,"It sounds like maybe you still have some anxiety, OCD and possible germaphobia that’s built up. I’d definitely recommend going to see a therapist whose versed in these types of things, I don’t think it’s uncommon for people who have previously had eating disorders to still feel a need for control and have their focus shift from food to other things, especially if the cause of the initial eating disorder was never properly addressed. So if you haven’t previously had therapy it might be really good for you to find the underlying cause of your anxiety and treat it as a whole and give you some coping mechanisms and strategies to tackle what’s going on.

I would also start subtly packing things in garbage bags ect, especially the important things while they aren’t watching and arranging for a friend to get them at a pre arranged place and time like behind your garbage bins ect.

I mean, he really does sound like a human trash receptacle though. Though if you really want to play the long long con apologise, say your incredibly sorry for everything, and beg to make it up to him. Then after a while once you’ve made up start asking (subtlety) for expensive things with a high resale value, start with smaller things like jewellery and work up over the years, and make sure that they are in your name, and resell them (obviously not all of them so he’s not suspicious) and open an account in your name that he can’t access And won’t find out about and get a financial advisor to invest your money.

And if he does try to pull crap just say sorry but it’s not fair for them to have family gatherings if you can’t attend so family gatherings will have to be held elsewhere. My nan gave me a fantastic piece of advice a while ago that I think applies here, when you’re in a situation like this the best thing you can do is smile and look like your having fun, because if you sit in a corner with a grumpy look on your face you’re the one who looks bad and you end up having a crap time time. And if your nice and polite people will be more likely to side with you in the future if he’s nasty because they see you tried to get along. And if it makes you feel better remember how much of a nob faced loser he is and pity him, because generally people pull petty crap like that when they’re miserable to pull other people down into the muck with them. And bonus points if you show your pity in subtle ways, because it will rub salt in the wound, though Im possibly a little petty like that when people pull crap with me so feel free to not do it ;p."

I guess though it sounds like maybe you need to decide if you really want your family in your life and what compromises you need to make if you want them at your wedding. Ie she can go to the ceremony but not the reception, or they have have to pay for her and accept all responsibility if she mucks up. Though I feel she can’t really be doing that well with her recovery/be serious about it if she’s letting your parents and other family do this to you.

I get it, it really sucks being woken up like that, and growing up in  a house with lots of other people can be hard on sleep, especially at your age when getting a decent amount is vital for proper brain development (I’m assuming you’re in your teens).

I mean they can’t really take the stance that just because they bought the gift they can force you to share it when they bought your brother the play station plus but don’t expect him to share it with you, for me if it’s a gift, once it is given, the gift giver has no say in what happens to it otherwise it’s not a gift."

And I get it, I really do! I’m a massive nigh owl but for my job I sometimes need to be up at 4:30am and if I’ve only had a few hours of sleep it’s not fair on me, my clients or safe to drive ect.

There are even free mobile numbers and online forums and websites like the butterfly foundation that are really good that can help you, especially in the early stages when your not really sure what to do. Even doing some research into it to try and identify what you have can be helpful because sometimes if you have a name for it, it’s not so scary and you can start to understand how to tackle it. Maybe once you’ve done a little research try sitting your mum or dad down again and really explain what’s going on with you and how serious an eating disorder is.

I honestly don’t even know how theyd get an estimate/quote over the phone though, so maybe he misunderstood or maybe they are indeed shonky. my dad always does an in person quote so he can get a proper grasp on the situation and make sure the job is as straight forward and streamlined as possible. And often people say they need one thing done and my dad gets there and sees that something completely different is needed or they have the wrong part ect. I don’t know how those guys run their business, and maybe they are shonky but I don’t have enough info to actually judge that and on here i always take the OPs story with a grain of salt because there are two sides to every story. Maybe my original judgement was knee jerk and rash but i guess with my understanding of it that’s the decision I came to when I was reading it, I thought he only had a problem with the $70 when he found out how much they would charge ($500). On a side note to a previous comment, though often seemingly simple/cheap jobs can turn into major cluster fucks and vice versa, like one guy had a “leak”, my dad told him to turn of all the taps and asked if he was sure, he did all the testing ect ect only do discover the guy hadn’t actually turned of the tap properly after all, this was only after having spent hours and hours testing things ect, and the bill was not cheap, or on the other hand he went out to fix a tap simple tap leak and found a major structural issue that cost thousands to fix so not everything is always cut and dry.

AmItheAsshole,fp247qf,t1_fp20ovg,1588254805.0,"My understanding was that was the call out fee? Ur right though that if it was a simple quote most people don’t charge for that though in my book it isn’t necessarily a bad thing as they have to take the time, effort and petrol ect to put together the quote. My issue isn’t with the plumbers or their practices as we aren’t judging them, more that the OP agreed to pay and then didn’t because he didn’t like the estimate which is a dick move in my book, but regardless of if the fee is a scam he agreed to pay it and then wasted everyone’s time. Lol no, $300 really isn’t he provides a full service, went through 5 years of tech, has had more training since and does every from roofing, gas work, straight plumbing, stormwater drainage, to waterproofing and more, and often doesn’t charge full price if it’s a five minute fix like a leaky tap. But big businesses are willing to pay that money because they know he’s there at any time of the day any day of the week, and they know they have no problem getting him back in if something does (very rarely) goes wrong, and he won’t charge if he does have to go back other than for parts. They know he does a good job, and is honest, willing to meet clients half way with things and has a seriously good work ethic ie has been called out at one in the morning for an emergency. He has had some of the same clients for over 20 years and they have shopped around, tried other tradies, tried to get “better deals” but always come back because they trust his work, know it’s quality and know he won’t take them for a ride."

Plus it’s a service just like any other and good tradesman should be paid as well as any other service eg if you higher a lawyer do u get the cheap one that doesn’t win or the good but expensive lawyer who gets the job done?

AmItheAsshole,fp1vwz4,t3_gasbp6,1588249293.0,"YTA, if this is even real, this behaviour is so incredibly problematic, she is a human being not a tool to exact your petty revenge, once a picture like that is out it can be screen shotted shared ect and once it is seen it can’t be unseen and the connotations those pictures have will follow her around for a long time. Grow up."
AmItheAsshole,fp1mfh2,t3_gasmd6,1588240602.0,"NTA, it sucks but sometimes for your own health and wellbeing you just have to cut the toxic people out of your life. If you genuinely thought he wanted to make amends and was getting better it might be a different story but this purely sounds like manipulation on his part. Cut him out and keep him out until your are 100% sure of his intentions, it may never happen but you have to put you and your family’s wellbeing before his."

AmItheAsshole,fp1lfia,t3_gaj8f0,1588239588.0,"NTA, honestly I think your parents have done him a serious disservice, he needs to be able to live in the real world and they have put him in a bubble, and when he does go into the real world and that bubble pops he’s not going to be able to cope. Because nobody else will back the way your parents have. They’ve also done you a serious disservice by stifling you and treating you in the way they did, and it makes me so upset when parents do this, and I honestly commend you for being as well adjusted as you are because I see so many siblings of those with disabilities who have been neglected, who have lashed out, rebelled and are incredibly bitter and resentful to their parents, siblings and their situation. You’re going to need to set some serious boundaries going forward because they will expect you to cater to your brothers every whim when they eventually get to old to look after him. And you know what? If he does go into a group home or something like that they won’t cater to him like your parents have and yet more problems will ensue. And It actually sounds like he’s pretty high functioning so coddling him like they have will most likely impact his independence and ability to adapt to situations outside of his control, eg independent living and finding work. Stand firm and get out as soon as you can, your friends have no idea how hard it can be or what your situation is like, you are allowed to be your own person and have your own interests and hobbies seperate to your family without you being a bad person. Drop their double standards and you do you."
AmItheAsshole,fp1khcd,t3_gam45n,1588238617.0,"NTA, I’m a bit petty and would consider leaving your alarm on for hours at 2 in the morning and not answer your phone ect, seriously though it’s a shared space and she has to understand you live there to, she can’t expect you to just let the alarm go off while your trying to sleep, I mean if I was the neighbour I would have been pissed to. You tried to get in contact, she didn’t reply, it’s a tough situation but honestly it’s just something I think she needs to move on from, or get a one bedroom apartment and live alone."
AmItheAsshole,fp1j672,t3_gam1d6,1588237323.0,"YTA, my dads a plumber and it annoys me so greatly when people do this, he spent his time, energy,  expertise and petrol getting to you and you know what?  Depending on the job $500 is nothing for a top quality plumber who will guarantee your work and come back and fix it at no extra charge other than parts if it breaks. If you want a low quote you’ll also get low quality and no guarantee it will work properly or that they’ll fix it when it inevitably mucks up, you get what you pay for. And then you’ll have to get a good plumber in to fix whatever cheap ass one you get in who’ll charge you double because they then had to undo all the damage the original plumber did. Or they won’t touch it at all and tell u to get the original plumber back who I can guarantee will dick you around. And depending on if you already had the parts or if it was purely an installation can change price to because of the cost of parts. I mean my dad charges a $300 minimum call out with a 1 hour minimum and you know what? People pay, because he is the best at what he does, he’s fair, reasonable, doesn’t f*$k up and guarantees his work, and 90% of the time when people go with the cheaper quote they come back to him to fix the problem because it’s still there or worse, at which point my dad has to say no because for insurance reasons he doesn’t want to get involved or be held liable for another plumbers work, or has to charge even more because he had to undo all the work and start from scratch. So yeah, if they’re a reputable plumbing company I’d go with them because you get what you pay for. I mean maybe it was expensive and could be done in less time ect by you but they run a business, have to make a profit and seem to have two people which is weird tbh unless it’s an apprentice (is this in America? Because I have no idea how you guys run things there).
Edit to add that this kind of thing is exactly the reason my dad mostly does commercial work, he had so many people trying to not pay bills because it was “to expensive” but as I said, sometimes getting the job done right is expensive, and things add up, and I’d rather get it done once and properly than pay 10x more having to get shonky people back over and over again. People forget that it isn’t a charity, tradies have bills and insurance and overheads and need to make a living."
AmItheAsshole,fp14tbb,t3_gaef9v,1588224426.0,"Absolutely NTA, it’s incredibly unfair in so many ways but unfortunately I don’t think there’s much you can do about it until you can move back out, at which point I’d be going little to no contact with them if possible depending on their other bahaviour. But hopefully this will be over soon and you can gtfo. This sounds like something for the entitled parents or narcissistic parents part of reddit maybe? But honestly you sound like a pretty good “kid” (you’re an adult but their child if you know what I mean) you do your chores and schoolwork and I feel your essentially an adult as you lived away from home and are only back due to the current circumstances, and it is unreasonable for them to micromanage your time in this way when you would have been doing your own thing when you were at school anyway."

AmItheAsshole,fp148ue,t3_gahqfm,1588223975.0,"NTA, but honestly your son might be, I kind of think it was more than a bit inappropriate for him (a 30 year old adult man) to be asking anyone for money like that, little own his 18 year old sister who he knows has trouble saying no. He also did it in a sneaky underhanded way by going to her in private to ensure you wouldn’t know, and hell, you wouldn’t have even known if your daughter hadn’t told you. And we both know he certainly isn’t going to pay her back without pressure or making a fuss, and I honestly think you need to ensure he does, because it will be showing your daughter that you are essentially picking his side if you don’t."
AmItheAsshole,fp12b84,t3_ga9liz,1588222499.0,"NTA, why would you even want to visit them when they have been so horrible, and he certainly isn’t defending you, I can guarantee that this will be a repeated issue in the future so consider if this is something you can put up with for the rest of your life."

AmItheAsshole,fp0unm0,t3_gaetb4,1588217311.0,"NTA, ultimately not only is this about your wife but your child and any other children you may haves mental health, and that is absolutely something you get a say in, especially if you know your wife isn’t in the position to make that call herself if her judgement is clouded by their abuse. You are well within your right to protect her and your kids especially from family, because often they are the ones who do the most damage, and I hope if I’m ever in the situation your wife is in I’d have a partner who would be strong enough to protect me even though it might hurt."
TrueOffMyChest,fp0t8wp,t3_ga9a68,1588216406.0,"I think the best you can do is reach out privately maybe through messenger or email and see what happens.

WeightLossAdvice,fox7ilc,t3_g9sz42,1588136015.0,"Definitely things like celery that take a while to chew if you chew properly and even swapping sugary drinks for soda water or mineral water, it gives you that satisfaction of a fizzy drink with no calories and drinking more fills you up."
AmItheAsshole,fox6hza,t3_g9suxp,1588135281.0,"So you both work full time yet you do all the work around the house and for the kids and clean his man cave even though you can’t use it? Yet he has the hide to make trouble about a camper that he had no interest in until you fixed it? Honestly I’m sorry but he sounds lazy and arrogant and his behaviour of turning your kids against you is down right malicious and borderline abusive, maybe you need to turn the tables on him and tell the kids that his man cave is better than your smelly old camper and that if he loved them he’d share his special space and see how he feels. I know it’s immature but you cannot back down on this issue, (however you proceed), you are NTA in any way shape or form and it sounds like it’s the only space you have that is your own. I think you need to consider if he is the type of person you want to spend the rest of your life with, unless some serious changes are made like equal sharing of house work and childcare ect. Also have you actually say him down and told him how this makes you feel? Or does he know and just doesn’t care? In which case yeah, consider what you want your future to be like."
relationship_advice,fox1j1w,t3_g9vgux,1588131871.0,"I mean there are absolutely no guarantees in life that you will be able to have biological kids, and I think it would be incredibly sad if you only married a person for their ability to do so.

She sounds toxic, if you can’t do it for yourself do it for your boyfriend and your relationship, because this is the type of thing that can seriously damage a relationship, especially when you know how badly it impacts him. You have to choose him or your family, because honestly unless you set down some serious ground rules with your parents and maintain them you will forever be being sucked into your sister drama and be used as a perpetual doormat. Hell don’t even do it for him, do it for yourself, they are damaging your mental health and your ability to live a normal healthy life. I’d go no contact with them all if possible, I know it will be extremely tough but in the long run it will be so much better for you."

If she’d asked then it’s a different story, but just because she’s sick doesn’t give her the excuse to behave this way, treat you like this, or cause you to have nasty hate filled messages sent to you.

I wouldn’t normally recommend this but maybe even do the whole I’m doing this to provide for you the life you have become accustomed to, so either you let me work or I lose my job, we move a smaller house and we don’t have a nanny and you might need to get a job."
