i’m finally forcing myself to pick it up again, though. i’ve been trying to draw at least once a day. sometimes it’s a full illustration and sometimes it’s just fixing the hair on someone, or the eyes or something. it feels good to just scribble something down when i haven’t in so long. i really hope you get through this. i’m going back to therapy soon, i hope you can also receive the help you need. <333"
