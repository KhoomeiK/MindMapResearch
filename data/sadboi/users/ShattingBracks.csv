I'm sure you know far more from your online 'research'. /s

In all seriousness idk why so many people seem to correlate transgenderism to fetishes and porn. It's about as much of a fetish as amputees; there are people into it (for some reason) but that doesn't mean that EVERY AMPUTEE intentionally chopped their arm off to become an amputee because they watched porn and thought ""I WANNA BE JUST LIKE HIM üòÅ"".

I never said it was wrong, or even insensitive, to say normal/abnormal; it's just not a good descriptor when talking about gender identity. Normal and abnormal are so general that I personally find it easier to use 'cis'.

You don't generally mention the fact that someone's black unless it's important to the discussion, the same goes with cis. Just because there are retarded cisphobic trans people, it doesn't make the whole term ""cis"" an attack on cisgender people.

Ok, so despite all procedure, I, a finally fucking qualifies adult transgender psychologist, agree that you're FUCKING TRANSGENDER OK OBVIOUSLY LIKE JESUS CHRIST YOUVE BEEN HERE FOR AGES FUCKING HELL. But JUST TO BE SURE (because you might still be a trender) you're gonna have to wait for 3 months for another appointment with the nurse.

Ok, so yeah you're a tranny woooahh blah blah blah here's the testosterone JK WE'LL SEND A LETTER TO YOUR DOCTOR IN A MONTH TO PRESCRIBE IT TO YOU. YOU KNOW? YOUR REALLY INCOMPETENT GP? LMAO HAVE FUN

My brother enjoys dumping his problems on me with the premise of ""YOU ALL SAY I SHOULD TALK ABOUT MY PROBLEMS"", however I've been openly suicidal for the past 3 months and then he still dumps his problems on me. Like dude I can barely handle myself, please talk to anyone but me."

gatesopencomeonin,eyvlekf,t3_cyp3al,1567500205.0,"Honestly this is the only reaction I've ever had when coming out.

I live in a proper dodgy area in the UK, the sort where you're gonna get shanked if you walk down the wrong street at night (or in the day even) but I've only ever gotten good reactions coming out as trans. I know it's probably a combination of factors, such as being FtM, passing well etc. But the fact that I haven't had any bullshit from coming out shows that society really is going in the right direction. :)

Like honestly in my area I'm more likely to get shanked for no reason than for being trans, and I'm fine with it being that way (well obviously the crime rate in my area is horrible and that should probably be sorted but you get my point)!"

truscum,evwwrss,t3_cln3nj,1564875494.0,"I'm quite strongly on the socialist/hard left side of the spectrum and always have been. Part of it was probably how I was brought up, with my parents being Greenpeace activists and all that.

I'm just a really fucking empathetic person, to the point where it's damaging to myself. I think that's probably why I hate systems like capitalism so much; stepping on the little guy to get on top. It makes me incredibly uncomfortable (like spider-under-skin levels of uncomfortable) how the rich and greedy can bribe their way to power and a louder voice just because they have more cash in the bank.

However, I'm very pro free speech and pro democracy, with every opinion and point of view being heard, no matter how big or small, even if they're stupid and wrong because that's how good discussions work.

Honestly a lot of the LGBT community nowadays is an echo chamber of virtue signalling and extreme censorship, hence the amount of socialist transgender folk that get angry if you don't agree with their specific political view. That sort of bigotry gives the left a bad name, and I'm sitting here face-palming as if I'm the only sane one left."

I was in recovery from pretty severe ITP, taking medication that basically shat on my quality of life, and for those 6 months of treatment and recovery, FFXV was one of the few things giving me enjoyment.

Even if a lot of people don't enjoy that game, it's still going to be one of my favourite games of all time just because of the amount of good it did for me.

Hold on to that enjoyment, it's glorious and will help you through the worst of times.
