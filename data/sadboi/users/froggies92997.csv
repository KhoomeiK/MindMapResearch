otherwise soil science, sustainable ag, sustainability, horticulture... there are so many to look at!

I also would like to plug anything soil science related; although I didn’t really enjoy soil science, Dr. Ed McCoy is an absolutely brilliant man. he’s smart, he’s precious, and his class is really easy (well, the general ENR 3000 was). but I would recommend anyone take his class just for the pure joy he brings to the subject."

there’s also a $300 sign-on bonus right now for drivers ($100 for the first month, $100 for the second month (I think?) and a final $100 in the sixth month).

I got the job purely for keeping busy during quarantine, but I’ll probably keep it up until I graduate. the job is super flexible and it’s mindless. so yeah!"

I feel like a terrible person so much of the time because a lot of people think BPD is just an excuse for being an asshole. Being an asshole to someone can be an explanation of BPD, but it is most certainly not an excuse. And to be honest, I wouldn’t even say I’m an asshole to people. I hear some stories about others and their interpersonal relationships, and I would say I try really hard to be a good person to my friends and family. I can really be a terrible person when I fear someone is going to abandon me and/or I want more from a relationship, but I do not by any means condone my actions. I work very hard in therapy to try not to act like that, and I’m growing constantly through the ups and downs. BPD explains my reactions to things, but it is not an excuse to act the way I do.

everyone has issues—absolutely. I think it should be routine for everyone to go see a mental health counselor (like it is routine to see a doctor and dentist) because there are just things we shouldn’t have to deal with alone. but yeah, thank you for the kind words 😌

I spent the entire time hating myself for the pain and anguish I caused him and hate to think that someone would consider those actions a symptom of the disorder.

It is harder for other engineering majors (Materials, CEGE and FABE are more lenient on the GPA).

[Here](https://advising.engineering.osu.edu/sites/advising.engineering.osu.edu/files/uploads/Admission_To_Major/engineering_major_application_information_su2020.pdf) is a list of the engineering majors and their guaranteed accepted GPAs. And here (below) is what the two main acronyms mean that you will see all over the PDF attached:

* **EPHR = Eligibility Point Hour Ratio.** This is an admission to major point-hour ratio (or GPA). You can view which courses are included in a major's EPHR by viewing the Major Application Guidelines below.
* **CPHR = Cumulative Point Hour Ratio**. This is the point-hour ratio (or GPA) you have earned at OSU.

AmItheAsshole,fi4kx12,t1_fi4k7v8,1582143248.0,bold of you to assume I’m sad about my own life because I’m siding with the facts... 🤔

AmItheAsshole,fi4gimd,t1_fi44869,1582140727.0,"therapy helps so many people. you have no right to tell people that their mental health isn’t valid. just because you’re some “macho human” with “no mental problems” doesn’t mean you can shit on other people. I for one have bipolar disorder. and it’s genetic. it can be traced back over 90 years ago in my family lineage.
aka, it WAS A THING 20, 30, 40+ years ago, but it wasn’t treated properly... which is why my grandpa killed himself when he couldn’t explain his emotions to other people.
amazing, my guy... you’re truly amazing 🙃"
AmItheAsshole,fi4g3qp,t1_fi4ccqz,1582140490.0,"oh dude, calm down. OP literally said she is 1) in a happy relationship and 2) doesn’t care about her ex. and it’s so obvious she doesn’t. HOWEVER, that therapist should be removed of her license. the point is not related to the ex; it’s related to the fact that it is ILLEGAL to date your clients so soon after being seen."

FiftyFifty,fi27r93,t3_f5ykyc,1582073424.0,I can watch/look at most of these. this one hits different though. I had to watch it between my fingers.
OSU,fhoc1wp,t3_f3twz8,1581749382.0,"I found that it was best just to put all of the formulas on the cheat sheet in order that you learn them in her class. I tried the whole putting down examples on the cheat sheet hoping she would use the same examples and ended up with a 56 on the first exam. For the following exams however, I received middle range Bs. The first exam will definitely have a problem about missing airplanes (or cars, or whatever), a carnival problem, a weight problem (with expected value), and that’s all I remember.
I took it last semester and ended up with a B. It was much easier once I really understood what worked best for me on the cheat sheet."

OSU,fhobg9m,t1_fhml4m5,1581748629.0,"to go off of this wonderful individual, those first semesters of college are usually the hardest. yeah, mental health and existential crises can still occur later on, but your first semesters consist of you trying to find your place in college (friends, clubs, study habits, etc.). it gets so much easier when all that is said and done and once you get into your major, classes are actually interesting! you got this, OP!"
