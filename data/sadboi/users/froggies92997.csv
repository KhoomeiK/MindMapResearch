I hear some stories about others and their interpersonal relationships, and I would say I try really hard to be a good person to my friends and family.

[Here](https://advising.engineering.osu.edu/sites/advising.engineering.osu.edu/files/uploads/Admission_To_Major/engineering_major_application_information_su2020.pdf) is a list of the engineering majors and their guaranteed accepted GPAs.

* **EPHR = Eligibility Point Hour Ratio.** This is an admission to major point-hour ratio (or GPA). You can view which courses are included in a major's EPHR by viewing the Major Application Guidelines below.
* **CPHR = Cumulative Point Hour Ratio**. This is the point-hour ratio (or GPA) you have earned at OSU.¬†

MurderedByWords,fl4enre,t1_fl3uuxu,1584811922.0,"Thank you for sharing this; sometimes when I get bogged down about all of this, I have a hard time putting things into perspective. We have lived through much worse, and we will get through this too. And, even better, we are doing it with better technology that is rapidly changing to fight this virus.
So yes, thank you for sharing.
Stay safe, everyone!"
funny,fkzjaqv,t1_fkzg5sx,1584672339.0,"glad you didn‚Äôt overwhelm the hospital with something you were already fairly certain was COVID. most doctors are saying that, if you‚Äôre pretty sure you have it but don‚Äôt need to go to the hospital, you shouldn‚Äôt go out to get tested. it helps for the model, but the tests need to be saved for people that are in the hospital who need to be quarantined. 
that‚Äôs the word on the streets (virtual streets) in the US, anyways.
glad you‚Äôre feeling better!"

AmItheAsshole,fi4gimd,t1_fi44869,1582140727.0,"therapy helps so many people. you have no right to tell people that their mental health isn‚Äôt valid. just because you‚Äôre some ‚Äúmacho human‚Äù with ‚Äúno mental problems‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean you can shit on other people. I for one have bipolar disorder. and it‚Äôs genetic. it can be traced back over 90 years ago in my family lineage.
aka, it WAS A THING 20, 30, 40+ years ago, but it wasn‚Äôt treated properly... which is why my grandpa killed himself when he couldn‚Äôt explain his emotions to other people.

HOWEVER, that therapist should be removed of her license. the point is not related to the ex; it‚Äôs related to the fact that it is ILLEGAL to date your clients so soon after being seen."

OSU,fhoc1wp,t3_f3twz8,1581749382.0,"I found that it was best just to put all of the formulas on the cheat sheet in order that you learn them in her class. I tried the whole putting down examples on the cheat sheet hoping she would use the same examples and ended up with a 56 on the first exam. For the following exams however, I received middle range Bs. The first exam will definitely have a problem about missing airplanes (or cars, or whatever), a carnival problem, a weight problem (with expected value), and that‚Äôs all I remember.
I took it last semester and ended up with a B. It was much easier once I really understood what worked best for me on the cheat sheet."
