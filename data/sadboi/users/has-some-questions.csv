Just know your kitty loved the crap out of you. Cats do feel emotions and they love back. (When they want to) She is sad you feel sad, but she knows that's how it's going to be for awhile. 

Right now all you can do is keep going and keep taking care of Andy. You're heart has been stabbed, but it will heal. It could take awhile though. You have to actively heal. If healing means being sad for a really long time, that's just how it is. But you have to keep living. 

You may never be complete again, but someday your memories of Cleo will make you smile instead of cry. Do your best to make it to those times.

So in elementary school, we had to do a history report on our grandparents. I quoted everything pretty well, but my teacher said I should deviate and say ""and it cost a whopping wheat penny"". Like a wheat penny was a lot back then. 

Once I was done and went back to sit with my grandpa, he gave me a spank before I sat down. I felt like the most worthless kid ever. I sat there and was sad and don't remember much else for that day. But I got an A. And my teacher said I did well. I had always loved doing plays as a kid....

After that day I hated public speaking and I'm pretty sure that moment was a root for my public speaking anxiety.

I'm so damn mad after reading this story. I didn't have much bodily autonomy as a kid, especially my hair. My dad beat my mom once for trimming my spilt ends. My hair was wheat blonde and also went down to my butt. My family would joke that if I had blue eyes, I would be more money in human trafficking. 

Once my dad went to prison (for a different thing), and we moved away from my grandparents, I chopped my hair to my shoulders and dyed is black. I probably almost killed my grandma. 

Since then, my hair has been the staple of what makes me myself. I dye it cool colors, I get punk-like haircuts, and cut it myself when I feel like it. (Also to my grandma's horror, RIP) 

For their grandma to do that is literal abuse. Their hair is a part of their body, and to cut it without at least parental consent, is just as harmful as hitting them or telling them to their face that ""long hair will make them gay"".

I have someone interested in this rosary, but I don't mind making duplicates if it sells. 

I love making custom rosaries for people! Planning out a rosary is my favorite part! Second favorite is making them!"

It's basically just messaging and transactions with PayPal or venmo. It easier to plan out custom rosaries on there and it keeps things in one place for me. Lol"
Catholicism,fnr9z48,t1_fnr8lbs,1587183010.0,"Welp, couldn't find gunmetal in the parts I use, but what do you think about rustic brown? Lol (https://www.etsy.com/listing/672248561/cross-pendant-rustic-brown-crucifix) 

They do have black parts, but the parts look ""used"" and that shows a copper-y tone underneath the black. I have used the rustic brown parts before and I really like them. 

But I also couldn't find wire that wasn't coated....

This might be a rosary that I actually can't do. 😔"
Catholicism,fnr8nl2,t1_fnr8lbs,1587182040.0,I'll take a look around and see what I can find!
Catholicism,fnr8iew,t1_fnr6soe,1587181936.0,I'd love to make a black version of this! I think the best I'd be able to find would be in gunmetal grey though. Or at least that's what I see often. I have used black coated wire though and it's so gross! It comes right off just with a finger nail. It was cheap wire though...
Catholicism,fnr89n0,t1_fnr6qjy,1587181758.0,Thank you!
Catholicism,fnr8983,t1_fnr6qay,1587181750.0,Thank you!
Catholicism,fnr87yz,t1_fnr57it,1587181725.0,"I started with a basic Wal-Mart jewelry making kit. And by started I mean I don't know any better but to keep using it. Lol (https://www.walmart.com/ip/Precision-Comfort-6-Piece-Jewelry-Tool-Kit-with-Carrying-Case/12347617)

This is the wire I get, but you could use any wire. I recommend wire without a coating. The coating comes off and it's just not good.  (https://www.etsy.com/listing/189593743/wire-24-gauge-vintage-bronze-craft-wire)

And you can use any beads your heart desires, but I really recommend this shop. (https://etsy.me/3ahdXlh) This is where I got these specific beads, but a chunk of the beads I have used so far have came from her. She has many kinds! 

For rosary centers and crucifixes, there are bunches on Etsy, so I just recommend looking around on there and seeing what calls out to you. 

This rosary is pretty specific with the wire wrapping and 4mm beads, but if this is how you want to start your rosary making journey, good luck! I started with regular eye pins you can get from Wal-Mart. That can be a good starting point if you'd like. 

I also recommend rosary kits! It's hard to find eye pin ones, but Wal-Mart sometimes has one. Not a great one though... I tried to find one, and this might be a good starting point with the wire and parts. (https://www.etsy.com/listing/458292474/basic-wire-wrapping-kithigh-quality) 

But yeah! If you have any questions, just send me a message! I love helping people to start making their own rosaries! Hand made by a loved one can be a lovely gift!"
