AskReddit,fmt77qi,t3_fx5hn4,1586367968.0,Someone time traveled back into time to become Jesus and used flavor water packets to tune the water into wine. He also resurrected the dead guy because he was not really dead and was instead in a coma. That person faked his death so Jesus’s resurrection would seem real. He did this to make the Church a religious power house and to gain influence over the entire world.

SuicideWatch,fls7v89,t3_fic73e,1585436229.0,"You should keep living for personal reasons too, not just for others. The only way to do it is to examine your life and see if you want anything besides death. If you can name at least one thing, than that thing is a reason to live. Being alive for others is okay too, we should try to find reasons to live in other things too. Even if it is just for a type of food, and maybe a certain pastime. They are all possible reasons. Last thing, being scared of death is totally reasonable, most people are. Don’t call yourself a pussy for not going through with it."
SuicideWatch,fls6vw1,t3_fir9m2,1585435631.0,"There are many reasons for suicide. These reasons vary from disorders, thinking things are better off without you, or just thinking that you have nothing left to live for. The reason some people find selfish is thinking that things are better off without you. They think that it is selfish to think that way and believe that the person is only thinking of themselves. The problem is that they have no idea how it feels. Some people truly feel worthless, and they should not be insulted and called selfish. The reasons for how they feel are their own, and they should not be judged for how they feel. It makes me sick for people to insult a person who is already going through a hard time."
