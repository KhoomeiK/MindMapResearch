There was a dude I was fwb for a little while and everytime--*EVERYTIME*--he'd asked if he was good enough. The first 2, hell 3 times, I was alright in answering. After that, it just showed how insecure he was. Which I also tried to be understanding and nice about, but it was getting to me how low his self esteem was. I'd probably tolerate it if we were bf/gf and I had feelings for him, but having sex with someone with that ""low vibrational energy"" wasn't really enjoyable.

socialwork,fnvd6jk,t1_fnc1avn,1587288853.0,"Hey, I just wanted to interject as someone who was diagnosed as an adult that it shouldn't have to be difficult to get a diagnosis. The only type of ""gate-keeping"" like that I've seen always seems to be online or older adults aka parents. I get it kind-of-not-really, but at the same time, it's not like anyone who *was* diagnosed beforehand knew they had it when they were born. We just flew under the radar until it actually started to affect us in adult life. This is especially true for women.

Something I saw someone say really stuck with me while I was still in that limbo phase before diagnosis: If you're worried you're faking it, you're not faking it. Because those who are faking it, know they're faking it. And if it turns out that it isn't what you suspected it to be, then you're at least one step closer to finding out what it is.

Now, I don't know if I just got lucky, did my research right, or the fact it might not be as stigmatized in my area like Alex above is making it out to be, but the psychologist I chose believed me all the way through. Although, I didn't mention off the bat that I think I had ADHD (which I already suspected). Instead, I talked about all the problems I was having now and in the past in academia that are related to the stereotypical symptoms of ADHD and got my therapist to suggest the diagnosis himself within 3 sessions. It was easy for my psychiatrist to believe me when I went in wanting medication since I said my psychologist believed I had it. Did the evaluation and ""passed."" Got started on meds the next day. Now, you don't necessarily need to go to a psychologist first, but I had some stuff to sort out besides my ADHD. I would say that if you're wanting this to steamroll as fast as possible, get an appointment booked as soon as possible--it's pretty common for offices to only have available new patient appointments a month out from when you call to make one.

Best of luck :)"

Major problem is your mindset. Which I *completely* relate to. I was stuck in a similar self-deprecating mindset when I was younger. I think you might find some camaraderie in r/aftergifted .

You are your own worst enemy. It's hella hard to change our inner monologue, but you *have* to if you want to change things. Which, I'm going to reckon you aren't quite there yet. You may be miserable, but you aren't miserable enough yet to do anything about it. You're still wallowing, still feeling bad about yourself, ""woe is me!"" Yet what are you doing to improve? Are you complaining just to complain? And I don't mean on Reddit. If there's no end goal besides to vent while you keep trucking along feeling sorry for yourself IRL, you won't get anywhere.

You don't have the talent because you stopped yourself from improving long ago. You don't see the journey others had to go down to get their skills to that point. It's not good on the psyche to keep comparing your growth and talent against others, because you will continue to tear yourself down once you see more ""artistically correct"" art. Art is subjective, and you've subjectively deemed your own art trash, forever.

If you're scared of how others will perceive it, then don't show it. Work on it in the shadows until you've perfected it, and then surprise everyone with your talent once it's up to your high standards. But if you really think you aren't cut out for it, then drop it. Mourn for the loss of it and move on. Maybe one day, when it isn't so important anymore, you'll find it in you to enjoy making art for art's sake alone.

But I think what you really need to drop is the idea of being a genius/perfect. You've already proven to yourself that you aren't one, so why bother to continue comparing yourself to such a high standard? Because here's the thing. In your act of scorning the idea of indulging in such activities while being less than perfect, you've fallen behind even the mediocre people. Your skills are *less* valuable than mediocre because you choose not to take any action. Only geniuses can be geniuses; everyone else has to do the work to get there. And you've stopped doing the work.

Academics and artists aren't all that prestigious or pretentious to keep out those who aren't geniuses. You're just gatekeeping yourself. There's plenty of others less than that in the field. You're putting these people on a pedestal when most of them are just normal, ordinary people.

Everyone is special, that's why it seems like no one is. You're deserving of being where you want to be--you only tell yourself you aren't. If you're looking for validation, here it is:

You. Are. Special.

You are special. You're so special, you don't *need* to be a genius or perfect in everything to do/become anything you want. All that's asked of you is the resolve.

I think you need to get out of your head for a little while. Let someone see that inner version of you. You'll see that it isn't really as bad as you say it is. You've just been keeping it inside for so long, it's beginning to stink."

abuse,fn9dusr,t3_g09dll,1586769131.0,"I am going to give you some tough love here, but it helped me get out of my situation in the past. I don't mean to offend, only to encourage in a different way than the others have:

You are willing to be disrespected just to keep loneliness away? But what about happiness? What about safety? You should be more afraid of being killed by him than you are of being lonely.

People come and go, like your ex. You can make friends later.  But you can't expect to make them if you continue to be how you were in the past. You can't keep up the ""woe is me"" mentality, which I know firsthand how hard it is to get out of when you are depressed, but that's also factored into how you got into this mess, too.

Now, to clarify, it's not your fault he's an asshole to you. Your feelings of depression and loneliness are valid. It's not your fault you wanted to be happy and were misled. It's not your fault for how he's treating you. You don't deserve it. No normal person would hold such a grudge against someone they supposedly love (some may be warranted but not how much he has!!). Right now, you are aware enough of the danger to seek out advice. Others have chimed in to support you leaving, as do I. How much more approvals do you need to get before it gets through to you? You should not wait until he hurts you even worse before you decide to leave.

A lot of people don't actually listen to that advice, did you know that? Because despite hurting so much, they aren't hurting enough to change their situation. They get a tiny, tinyyy glimpse of happiness and hold onto it like a drug, forgetting the long hours of abuse and unhappiness they endured just beforehand. Don't let his small bouts of kindness blind you.

Are you going to dig yourself deeper into your depression hole? Are you going to wait until you *REALLY* hit rock bottom before you decide to take action? Because it's only going to go downhill from here. He *will* escalate. He *won't* stop. Your safety & well-being *don't* matter to him. And he may try to make up for abusing you, but I can assure you it's only because it made him feel bad about himself. Will you repeat the pattern of those who came before you, or will you be the one to break it and become free while you still have your dignity? Either way, we want you to eventually get out of this situation. Alive. But *sooner* is better than later. And later is better than never.

Additionally, it would be best to move back with your family if possible. Even if it's just for a few months. You need the stability. You are obviously unhappy in the new country (if that's where you still are). You definitely need to be surrounded by people who care for you, especially after this. It will make you feel better on the loneliness side, too. The shame you may get/feel for leaving the marriage is much *much* better than the abuse you are enduring now. If you can't stay with your relatives, you need to find a domestic abuse shelter. They will take good care of you until you can get back on your feet.

And for Pete's sake, don't get pregnant by him! A child will never fix your relationship nor his behavior. It will just trap you with him, making it even harder to leave. Don't make it harder on yourself.

If you still can't pull the trigger to get out, document *everything*. Take photos of your injuries. Screenshots of his texts that are verbally abusive. Record phone calls if you can. Upload them to a cloud storage immediately after taking them so you always have the proof. You did good already by notifying your doctor. Do not let him silence you! Let your family know about your situation. Hell, tell his family, too, if you feel it is safe enough to.

You made you dream of getting married a reality. Now it's time to face reality."

When I had long hair, I only went to the salon *maybe* twice a year, so it was definitely a change.

Maintenance also in terms of styling too. It's much easier for short hair to get disheveled from sleeping, so that means time *needed* to style it in the morning. But if you're the type to style your hair everytime you go out, it really shouldn't be any more of a hassle. Rather, it'd take less time to style, for obvious reasons lol but again, you usually *have* to style it more often than not.

That's about the only quips I have with it. I love not having to tie my hair up or having a sweaty neck from my hair during the summer, not having to push strands of hair behind my ears while I'm looking down at my desk or wherever.

antinatalism,flt8sj3,t3_fpwy45,1585463084.0,"In general, yes, it's cheaper to adopt older children. Just make sure you do your due diligence in understanding how to navigate raising them.

Also, it really irks me that you said they would be more grateful. Please don't assume things like that. Don't hang it over them. Get over any savior complex you may have. If you adopt, you do so because you're taking that task onto yourself.

It's also not so easy peasy to deal with any trauma the child has gone through while in the system. That shit can take a whole lifetime to get over. Counseling isn't going to make it go away. Meds aren't going to magically flush out their problems. You can't be so casual when it comes to things like that. If you think it's just a small hurdle to get over in a few months, you're in for a shitstorm. Obviously, not every child will have trauma and the degree varies between each individual that does. But unfortunately, foster care lends itself to exploit these children who have no guardians. So yes, abuse is rampant. I don't think there's any person whose been in the system that doesn't have a story about abuse and neglect, whether onto them or others in the house.

I can tell you're just at the beginning stages of considering adoption, that or are staying ignorant to the dark side of it. If you are serious about adopting, read the stories of adults who were adopted and aged out of care. So you humble yourself and not make the same mistakes their adopted parents made. Don't just take in the information and stories of the adoption agencies and parents. And especially stop thinking the children'll be grateful for you adopting them.

It's just another 'in-group' thing, which you don't ever have to be apart of if you don't want to be. Don't feel bad for not being the adult *they* want you to be.

Who cares if people seem more mature because of their children. People who went through trauma also seem more mature for their age. There's no one set way of growth, good and bad. If you feel conscious of your 'lack of maturity' you needn't have kids to kickstart that. But honestly, you're fine just as you are. Laugh at farts, whatever. It's not like you're harming anyone.

Consent is free of any of those negative feedbacks. You should not be apprehensive to give your consent. You should not feel unsafe for *not* consenting otherwise. 

He will most likely twist your 'non-consent consent' against you and authorities, but remember that you said and did what you needed to do to survive the situation.

As much as it would be amazing if we could just get these people to adjust to society by exposure with everyone else, the truth is that they need to be rehabilitated and distanced, taking small steps to get back into the mainstream.

The sadder part is that many times, this also just keeps them in the same environment that made then that way in the first place. So the cycle never breaks."

antinatalism,fkhfqdf,t3_fhlpdi,1584197720.0,"The only real ethical adoption option is adopting older children, but no one cares to adopt them because they're 'tainted' or whatever excuses people jump to. Infant/baby adoption is very unethical unless they're attached to an older sibling whose circumstances highlighted the reason why they're in the system now.

If you're wanting to adopt or foster, please do your research. Read the stories of adults that were adopted or aged out, not just what parents and agencies say. You cannot expect these children to fill a void in you. It's a duty you ultimately decide to impose on *yourself*, not them. If you have an itch for savior complex, please kindly either throw it in the trash and humble yourself firstly or never adopt/foster ever."

adhdmeme,fjzxvb5,t1_fjzvzy5,1583733248.0,"ADD no longer exists under the new DSM. It's now the Inattentive Affect (IA) subtype of ADHD.

You have to realize the amount of mental gymnastics the normal person would have to do to understand ""deficient"" in the way that you described, which granted isn't much, but the mind loves to keep things simple. I guarantee that if people hear ""deficient"" their brains would automatically equates that to ""lack of."" Not lack of *normal* attention, but lack of attention completely. So most laypersons will see that and assume there is lack of attention for the sole purpose of it being lacked and not the fact that our attention is much more complex than that.

That's one reason it isn't a great title for the disorder. The implied meaning shadows the medically understood extension of the word."
adhdmeme,fjzg88a,t1_fjzfi87,1583718998.0,"Not everyone with ADHD experience hyperactivity, at least in the stereotypical physical way it's protrayed. Our attention isn't deficient so much that it's harder to concentrate that attention to a single task like NTs unless it's something that releases dopamine for our brains. In which case, we hyperfocus. But wait, if we can hyperfocus, then doesn't that go against the ""fact"" we're attention deficient...?

In other words, it isn't the best title for the disorder since it uses stereotypical behaviors to name it when not everyone is hyperactive and we definitely aren't attentionally disabled in the sense that the phrase ""attention deficient"" can elicit."
