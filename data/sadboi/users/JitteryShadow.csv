He tore his ACL after being home for a couple weeks and currently is two weeks away from being allowed to resume running and full activity. So he has been to the vet like four times in the last six months. So nothing obvious that they have seen, but I haven't asked about the shaking specifically.

I found a few places that trained them from puppies, but none that had any ready to go (at least not in my state). I got super lucky and my mom heard about a place that had a fully trained psychiatric service dog that was ready for a home. I would start by looking for places online and check with any mental health professionals you see. You also have the options of self training a dog, but that is a lot of work. If a service dog would help with your day to day functioning then you are definantly deserving of a service dog. Only you know your specific situation and I hope that everything works out.
