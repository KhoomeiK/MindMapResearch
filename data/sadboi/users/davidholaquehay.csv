If you are comfortable with your flaws and attributes everybody will be comfortable having you around. If they are nor used to ppl like you, they can still grow a sense of being comfortable if you are comfortable with yourself. Pleasing others is good when it comes from a sense of enjoyment and not from neediness just because that way youll keep them around. Allow yourself to understand that you can be loved because you love yourself. Enjoy your confidence and accept it."

For example, I go out more when i have a car, ill find myself a gf when i graduate, i need to make more money first, etc. Perfectionism can make you work harder and sometimes motives you to get the best, but perfectionism also stops you from executing when you think youre not prepare. In reality, we have to embrace messiness. Maybe we believe our life is not in aligment or that it is a chaos. Well, we gotta embrace that chaos and take action no matter what. If you feel out of shape, it doesnt mean you cant take action and do other things while you work out. Age should not stop you. If you still want something is because you can get it. You have to believe you deserve, not just want, but deserve what you want. Never is too late to take action. Dont wait"

Once you find yourself in certain situations, youll see you dont crack under pressure. Youll feel confidence once you take action. Our body reacts the same whether we are afraid or excited. If you experience a little anxiety stop, breathe, and tell yourself you are excited to do something awesome instead of being afraid. Take action no matter what happens youd still be okay. You are confident. Confidence will lead to competence which will lead to more confidence. No more excuses"

SuicideWatch,fbz90kh,t3_eeyc3w,1577238875.0,"Im totally straight but for some reason i was ashamed to accept i liked girls then it hit me. When i was a kid I had a magazine with some beautiful women in it(it wasnt even porn) and i guess my mom found it and she told me i should be ashamed for objectifying women or something like that. I didnt know what to do when i liked a girl. One day I said enough is enough. I saw a psychologist and she helped me change my limiting beliefs with CBT. Then i knew i needed some exposure therapy, so i hired a dating coach. He pushed me to approach some girls. I got rejected a lot and felt like i was never gonna get good at it. Then i went to a psychiatrist and i got prescribed clonazepam and i realized i was able to push more interactions coz i was less anxious. CBT, Exposure therapy, and meds helped me. I feel good about being around women and explore intimacy with them.



Honestly ask yourself if any of the following apply to you:
1. Fear of being vulnerable to being hurt
2. Avoidance of risk
3. Inability to let go of hurts and fears even if they occurred a long ago (especially those from previous relationships)
4. Chronic defensiveness
5. Fear of being too exposed or being found out for who you “really are”
6. Difficulties or an inability to show affection, tenderness, or caring
7. Difficulties or an inability to be open and honest with people
If you can recognise yourself and your own behaviour in many of these, it is likely you may on some level have a fear of intimacy. While a small amount of anxiety is common, if the magnitude of these fears reach the point of stopping you from experiencing intimacy with another, then it poses a significant barrier to what is a essentially a basic human desire and possible detachment from meaningful relationships.


Do whatever it takes to break free and have unstoppable confidence.  Work on your fear of failure and fear of success.


Dont give up pls"

When you get rejected, you also build confidence cause it tells you mind you are okay with it and dont crack under pressure. You should teach yourself you approach to enjoy connections and you are not there begging for validation. If a girl validates you, enjoy it but dont need it. When you approach without caring about what others think of you or pressuring yourself on certain results, you approach with confidence. And you are genuine because you talk to girls just for the sake of enjoying the interaction, flirting, seducing, etc. You should watch Honest Signalz on yt and also watch a movie called Fight Club.

If a girl validates you and think you are boyfriend material. Enjoy it but dont need it. When you approach without caring about what others think of you or  pressuring yourself on certain result, you approach with confidence. Live it up. Dont let life live you. Rejection wont affect you much when you dont need others approval. Rejection also helps you build confidence cause it is a way to tell your mind you are okay with it and dont crack under pressure.
