The other alternative is that the big things are obvious anxiety triggers- he is aware they could create an issue, so he is using coping mechanisms to keep things under control. However, the smaller issues might cause the same anxiety but he doesn't recognize them as something to ""cope with.""  


While this is a lot of theorizing. I recommend speaking to him--- I wouldn't phrase the question as you have to us because for all you know he is anxious and dealing with it in a different way.
