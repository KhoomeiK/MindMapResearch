It’s because of the culture of promiscuity. Like what the actual fuck do you think is gonna happen?

As hookups grow more and more normalised, people are going to only factor in looks at an accelerated rate. So then that means the top 1% of men are going to get all the attention because women have their pick of the litter, and obviously they’re going to go for what’s best. Making apps like tinder fall prey to the system that leftist ideology is creating. Fuck who you want, it’s fun! No one gets hurt !

Except it’s not true. I see it in millions of men like you who are fed up with not being in the top 1% of men in attractiveness, I see it in women who fuck around for 15 years and then suddenly they’re 40 and want kids, but can’t have any. It hurts women like me who don’t want to have random sex, but are damn near expected to because of the increasing amount of women that do sleep around. 

Promiscuity affects EVERYONE NEGATIVELY, I’m not asking you to be a celibate Christian, but just realise how society checks and balances on the aspect of dating and maybe start making some changes in your life."

Like I probably wouldn’t have killed myself with the problems I had before, but wasting thousands of dollars on education that got screwed away while I held against my will in a hospital, welp, they pretty much made that decision for me lmao. 

PLUS, I have a 3K medical bill now !!!!!! And I’ll be forced to drop out of university !!!! 

I might kill myself this year, I think I’ll keep working really hard on my missing work, even though my teacher just emailed me today saying she won’t take it.

I really don’t want to kill myself at home tho, idk why, I just don’t.

I really need her money right now, so that’s probably it. Maybe that’s what you get for abusing your children, kids who use you for money once they’re adults and pretend to like you. 

I’ve seen people with stories on here with parents that have done far less to them, and I mean, FAR LESS, in fact, I would say physically assaulting your tiny children is about as bad as you can get, and they completely push them away and cut them out and it’s not fair. 

The love from a parent to a child is something like no other. And I think it’s disgusting the way I see some people on here use that to their advantage. “You won’t see me anymore if you don’t do this for me.” 
Obviously sometimes it’s warranted, as in my case. I just chose not to. 

And despite me thinking this, I don’t have that. My mother is just, not a mother. She’s not a best friend either. More just like a person I ended up living with like my roommate. So how do I know this love exists? I honestly feel it so strongly to my future children. I could never hit them like my mother did to me, I want to be everything my mother wasn’t to them and I already love them unconditionally. I literally can’t wait to be a mom. 
And I would be devastated if I did everything I could to be the best mom and it wasn’t enough and they left me.

If you’re not going to curse out other people on here (which is always the right thing to do), then I will. 

Obviously this entire reddit is ignorant, asshole atheist libtards who can’t even handle the most agreeable of words being pro-jesus, so just know you’re all wrong, and Lianides was literally being so courteous and all you awful people stepped all over them. fucking disgusting. 

I originally came here to say that your dad isn’t entirely wrong, there is something to be said when you don’t feel bad about skipping church anymore. I moved away to university and I can attest to it, I just moved here so I’m trying to get my feet on the ground before searching for a church. 
However, you’re not going to hell for missing church because forgiveness is a core tenant of Christianity, obviously something the whole lot of you need to embrace. 

god sees all sins equally = 114 downvotes

insaneparents,f394g8g,t3_dfw01c,1570743556.0,"This sounds exactly like my mom.

And I’m white and live in the United States, so for me, it’s definitely not a cultural thing. My mom is just straight up psycho on her own. 

She’d do more than just spank me and my little sister, I was usually the recipient because I have ADHD and I acted up a lot as a little kid, however, I obviously had a condition that made it difficult for me to behave the way I should have been. 

Her “signature move” was to rake her nails across my skin. She has these god awful, long nails that she keeps perfectly manicured. When I was in 5th grade, my grades were really bad because school moved too fast for me and I was really disorganised due to my learning disability, so she raked her nails across my arms almost daily. 
I’m 20 years old and I still have the scars on my arms to prove it. 

One day, I was going to youth fair for 4-H (I train dogs), I was probably like 13, and we were running late because I never was really focused in the morning and usually took forever to get ready, so my mom got pissed at me and shoved me into the corner of a countertop. The sharp edge didn’t exactly pierce my chest, it hit right below the base of my neck, around where my clavicles meet in the middle, so it hit bone mostly. However, for the rest of the day, I could not take a full breath as it was extremely painful to even take shallow breaths. 

Then when I was like 15, I made it into this modelling agency based on my own initiative to go and audition. So when we went to orientation, she brought my little sister and I was wondering why she was there and then I realised that my mom wanted her to be a model too even though I was the one who auditioned. I didn’t really think much of it until a few weeks later when I asked my mom what was going on with it, so she told me that she signed my sister, but not me because she thought I was too fat. Hence why I now have a eating disorder. 

Another day, I was probably around 8 or 9, we were running late for my basketball game, so my mom turned around in the car from the front seat to take her nails down my leg. 
So when we walked into the gym, I decided to just let the blood run down my leg in full view of all. My mom eventually made me go wash in the bathroom and she was like, “oh, did I do that? Sorry.” (AFTER everyone saw my torn up leg.)

She and my dad actually almost killed me and my sister one day. They were fighting with each other, and my mom was driving. We were driving back down our driveway and my mom was probably going like 30 MPH down our gravel driveway and my dad yelled at her to slow down. So my dad grabbed the e-brake and our car flipped several times before landing on it’s side. My little sister was like 5 at the time and i was 9. 

And do you want to know the weirdest thing about all of this? Is that she doesn’t remember any of it. Except the car thing obviously, kinda hard to forget that. But every time I bring up what she used to do to me, when I show her the scars on my arm, she calls me a liar and that I did the damage on my arms to myself. I did do that once or twice, but I could point and show you which ones were from me and which ones were from my mom. 
She just wrote off all blame and said I did all of it tho. 

Now I’m 5’11 and 120 pounds and sleep an average of 2 hours a night!
