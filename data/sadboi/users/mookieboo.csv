I will continue to grow into this person

Today’s reading— What needs my attention?

1– What needs healing?
7 of wands: Let go of paranoia and self distrust. External influences that aren’t serving my higher self. Heal & make stronger my sense of self. 

2– What needs accepting?
6 of wands: Reflect on my own goodness, strengths and integrity. Accept that I am able to do right by myself and follow my moral compass. 

3– What needs releasing?
The Tower XVI: Letting go of ego. Free yourself from doubt. Destroy your false self. Release close mindedness. Release old toxic beliefs. Big shift in life."

Tarotpractices,fdlq2gg,t1_fdkt9ws,1578529783.0,"so as I was doing the reading, if I needed clarification while looking up the meanings I would pull a second card from the deck. no reshuffling or anything just another card to help clarify"

tarot,fdiwi6j,t3_elmiup,1578452625.0,"1 what do I really want from this situation?
3 of cups!!! I got in a fight with one out of my two other peas in a pod so pulling this card was incredible. I feel like we were a lil girl gang and I screwed it up so this card is spot on. I want to regain our friendship, have a happy ending & feel relief

2 what is my internal compass guiding me towards
Page of Wands! Yes. My question was should I continue to seek forgiveness from this friend even though I feel hurt by her attitude towards my apology. This card tells me to continue and seek the loyalty, companionship and continue expressing my regret. 

3 outcome if I move forward with this decision
9 of cups!!! So reassuring to see this card. Emotional stability, comfort, contentment and satisfaction. 

So I was already leaning towards this, but I am now 100% sure to continue fighting for this friendship. I am going to make a care package and show my girl friend how much I love her and am sorry for the hurtful things I said."

Tarotpractices,fdcszis,t1_fdcopjm,1578283458.0,yes exactly!!! I combined the meanings not disregarded. the cards I drew second or third actually had similar meanings so it helped clarify and tie together what they cards wanted to tell me.

Tarotpractices,fdcckvi,t3_ekly5d,1578271637.0,"So this was my first ever spread with the deck I received for xmas and I can say SHE IS CHEEKY!!! 9 of cups for what do you think of yourself? 

what are you here to teach me? knight of cups so i’m thinking creative energy into structure, encouragement 

4 of cups for what do you think of me :( kinda accurate though. 

I struggled with the our relationship question so I pulled a second and WOW wheel of fortune? answered my questions!!

the deck’s strength was hard because this card seems negative to me? so I interpreted it was telling me to gain perspective and look for gratitude. then I drew the knight of pen which is like responsibility, reality, focus. 

the deck’s weakness also was hard because the cards are all positive? so many the deck struggles with love/relationships/intimacy? these were all creative/lovey cards so that’s all I got. 

potential for our relationship, 9 of pen was a great sign though! independence, nourishment, acceptance, serenity. 

I can’t wait to continue to get to know my lil deck lady. 😊


any comments, etc welcome!"
Tarotpractices,fda5xe9,t3_dz2p9x,1578242142.0,"Hello all!!! I’m extremely new to tarot (aka got them for xmas). I got the Golden Universal Tarot deck by Roberto De Angelis. I’m suuuper excited and would love to have a laid back mentor to help me clarify & expand my knowledge. 

About me: 25 year old personal trainer/health coach. Experience in mental health personally and professionally. BS in psych. Doggy mom. Anti diet. Body positive. Super competitive. I cuss, I lift heavy, I eat way too much chocolate. I’m not your typical personal trainer 😂

I’m interested in intuitiveness and connecting with my higher self/higher purpose. I read “Wtf is tarot & how do I do it?” by Bakara Wintner & I love her style/voice/approach! So maybe someone like that? 

Also I’m located in northern VA if anyone is local that’d be cool but I’m not opposed to virtual mentor either 😇

TIA!!"
Tarotpractices,fczmkn6,t1_fcoekd1,1578104506.0,I recently had a reading from windsinger89 and it was wonderful! I’m super new to tarot so having her reading was fun to compare with my resources and my deck. I think she was very detailed and the cards she pulled did speak to me in this upcoming year. I feel super excited to reflect back on this reading in a couple of months and use the cards guidance as a motivation!!! Thank you!!!
