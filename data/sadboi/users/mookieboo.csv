Today‚Äôs reading‚Äî What needs my attention?

1‚Äì What needs healing?
7 of wands: Let go of paranoia and self distrust. External influences that aren‚Äôt serving my higher self. Heal & make stronger my sense of self. 

2‚Äì What needs accepting?
6 of wands: Reflect on my own goodness, strengths and integrity. Accept that I am able to do right by myself and follow my moral compass. 

3‚Äì What needs releasing?
The Tower XVI: Letting go of ego. Free yourself from doubt. Destroy your false self. Release close mindedness. Release old toxic beliefs. Big shift in life."

tarot,fdiwi6j,t3_elmiup,1578452625.0,"1 what do I really want from this situation?
3 of cups!!! I got in a fight with one out of my two other peas in a pod so pulling this card was incredible. I feel like we were a lil girl gang and I screwed it up so this card is spot on. I want to regain our friendship, have a happy ending & feel relief

2 what is my internal compass guiding me towards
Page of Wands! Yes. My question was should I continue to seek forgiveness from this friend even though I feel hurt by her attitude towards my apology. This card tells me to continue and seek the loyalty, companionship and continue expressing my regret. 

3 outcome if I move forward with this decision
9 of cups!!! So reassuring to see this card. Emotional stability, comfort, contentment and satisfaction. 

So I was already leaning towards this, but I am now 100% sure to continue fighting for this friendship. I am going to make a care package and show my girl friend how much I love her and am sorry for the hurtful things I said."

Tarotpractices,fdcckvi,t3_ekly5d,1578271637.0,"So this was my first ever spread with the deck I received for xmas and I can say SHE IS CHEEKY!!! 9 of cups for what do you think of yourself? 

what are you here to teach me? knight of cups so i‚Äôm thinking creative energy into structure, encouragement 

4 of cups for what do you think of me :( kinda accurate though. 

I struggled with the our relationship question so I pulled a second and WOW wheel of fortune? answered my questions!!

the deck‚Äôs strength was hard because this card seems negative to me? so I interpreted it was telling me to gain perspective and look for gratitude. then I drew the knight of pen which is like responsibility, reality, focus. 

the deck‚Äôs weakness also was hard because the cards are all positive? so many the deck struggles with love/relationships/intimacy? these were all creative/lovey cards so that‚Äôs all I got. 

potential for our relationship, 9 of pen was a great sign though! independence, nourishment, acceptance, serenity. 

I can‚Äôt wait to continue to get to know my lil deck lady. üòä


any comments, etc welcome!"
Tarotpractices,fda5xe9,t3_dz2p9x,1578242142.0,"Hello all!!! I‚Äôm extremely new to tarot (aka got them for xmas). I got the Golden Universal Tarot deck by Roberto De Angelis. I‚Äôm suuuper excited and would love to have a laid back mentor to help me clarify & expand my knowledge. 

About me: 25 year old personal trainer/health coach. Experience in mental health personally and professionally. BS in psych. Doggy mom. Anti diet. Body positive. Super competitive. I cuss, I lift heavy, I eat way too much chocolate. I‚Äôm not your typical personal trainer üòÇ

I‚Äôm interested in intuitiveness and connecting with my higher self/higher purpose. I read ‚ÄúWtf is tarot & how do I do it?‚Äù by Bakara Wintner & I love her style/voice/approach! So maybe someone like that? 

Also I‚Äôm located in northern VA if anyone is local that‚Äôd be cool but I‚Äôm not opposed to virtual mentor either üòá

TIA!!"
