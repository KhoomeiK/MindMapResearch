Season 1 was cringe at the start but got better towards the end
Season 2 was a good season all round
Season 3 seemed to drag a bit at the start 
Season 4 similar to 3 I think
Season 5 practically amazing at the start but started to drag, the ending was good tho.
Season 6 I don’t know haha it’s a whole new world, kind of a hit or miss with fans. It was definitely a hit with me though."

greysanatomy,fp2bewm,t3_g9xdih,1588258784.0,"I actually loved season 11, and 14. Don’t get me wrong the other seasons have their really good episodes like 12x09 (genuinely my all time favorite episode of the whole series) and of course I like all the other seasons, season 11 though really stands out. I’m at season 16 ep 16 (watching from Australia so that’s why I’m a little behind) and I still enjoy it, the show has definitely changed, become more comedic than medicine based but I guess that’s what’s expect with such a long running show. it’s ultimately your choice to continue or not but I think sticking with it is a good idea, even just for those few really good episodes. 

Like I said tho totally up to you, your going to have a million different opinions and who knows you may like season 16 the most! But you’ll never know if you don’t watch it haha"

mentalhealth,fnx4tga,t3_g44hkt,1587331489.0,"So I was raised fine probably more towards the sheltered side, I had an incident at 7 sexually speaking (idk what to even refer it to since it was nothing really) that was probably the big thing until i was 12 other than dad getting mad and I’d be in panic attacks (he never hit me, just yelled and fought my older brother and sister) anyway at 12 right before Christmas my parents got a divorce or atleast broke up. January, my sister was diagnosed with cancer and then she died 9 months later. I made a best friend during this time and he passed away too again right before Christmas.

So I don’t really understand why I developed it or if I was born with it; I have brief memories of writing I hate you on the wall and it meant me. And I was very obsessive or protective when a sibling (there were 6 of us I’m the second youngest) would bring home a partner.

I have ptsd depression and anxiety so I think it’s just a big mixture of that. Also mum has bipolar so I’m sure there’s a link somewhere."
The100,fnx22v7,t3_g445ss,1587329949.0,"Truthfully I don’t mind who dies, as long as it is a satisfying ending. My fav characters are Clarke and Murphy (especially their love/hate relationship) so is be sad for the show to kill off its cockroaches, but if their death makes the show better I’d want to see it.

You mentioned only Bellamy has forgiven Octavia but I think Clarke has too, madi said that line of “she bore it so they didn’t have to” and I think that resonated with Clarke. I also think the leader perspective and the I’ve done bad things too perspective that Clarke has supports that."
greysanatomy,fnv2ybw,t3_g3zld5,1587278513.0,"I actually remember my first watch of this and I felt really satisfied with how they ended Christina’s ark, the show changed but her whole storyline just felt really well finished imo.

The100,fn2taaz,t1_fmzvkec,1586602434.0,I also think Kane thought/thinks Bellamy had feelings for Clarke or atleast loved her (not necessarily romantically) particularly because of that scene in season 3 episode 1 where he says “I can’t lose Clarke” to Monty when they were trying to find her.

In terms of sadness I think Finns and Lexa’s. Finn mostly because of that raven moment and Clarke’s freak out the next episode. And I liked lexa as a character so that’s why it was sad for me haha. I thought Kane’s was sad too, mostly because we saw Indra cry and say the skikru poem
Although Abby’s death was so sudden and even though you could tell it was going to happen it was like ripping off a bandade. I’ve seen a crack video of the scene in a quiet place and it’s so realistic and similar to how I reacted."

In terms of romantically, I’m a bit of a clexa fan but anyone with Clarke will do since she’s my favorite!"
The100,fegnhuy,t1_feefiz9,1579098017.0,Yes as much as I love Eliza Taylor and any of her scenes I have to say that scene with Lindsey Morgan as ALIE was so good also Isaiah Washington in season 1 where he says ‘I lost my son’ was also incredible to watch
The100,fcwm194,t3_eizv74,1578029416.0,"It’s a hard choice for me, it’s Definitely either season 6 or season 2, followed closely by season 3 then probably 5/4 then season 1

Season 6 was so cool I was giddy about it the whole time I was watching it, I loved the Josephine/Clarke scenes and absolutely loved the Murphy scenes too, his development was brilliant.  I’ve gotta say as far as favorite episode it would probably the one where Clark ‘gives up’ I think it’s ‘nevermind’. Also the first episode with Clarke and Murphy going at it gosh I loved it. Least favorite moment with season six would probably be the ending (mostly because we don’t understand it) 

Season 2 I loved the whole plot especially the ending but I’d have to say my favorite scene had to be when Clark is going at Lexa for trying to kill Octavia! That whole ‘Get Out’ moment when lexa was so threatened because she knew what Clarke was saying was the truth.  Fins death also was something you half wanted to happen half didn’t, I think the acting was really good and that moment when lexa kind of goes what the- when she realises what Clarke just did. Least favorite moment for season 2 would probably be the jaha/Murphy looking for the city of light only because I was so into the mount weather drama that after watching it the first time it just became kind of a chore (and I’ve watched season 2 many times lol) 

Season 3 was good too it’s pretty close behind. I loved seeing Clarke go crazy and her scenes where she kept hating on lexa were so funny as a viewer, kind of like yeah you go girl teach her a lesson. But Id have to say my favorite episode in season 3 was where they were trying to get the chip out of raven it was great and the whole ‘no it’s lexa’ part where everyone kind of realised why Clarke stayed with her and that she loved her, even that split second moment when jasper realised it. Lincoln’s death was brutal but I feel, like lexa it has to happen. Least favorite moment is probably after they killed all the grounders, I understand why they did it (writing wise) doesn’t mean I like it haha

Season 5 I really liked, not as much as 6 or 2 but still an awesome season.  I think the first episode is one of my favorite ones mostly because of the scene where Clarke was like ‘I’m done’ that pure hopelessness was something I could connect to. I also loved the scene with madi where she said ‘they were always the hero’s, when all along it was you’. It really Emphasises how hard it was for Clarke to take credit for how much she helped her people, how big of a toll the ‘bad choices’ took on her.  Least favorite moment is probably when raven and Abby have their scene

Season 4 had some pretty awesome moments I just prefer season 5. I think my favorite moment was when Clarke injected herself with the night blood. It’s kind of when she realised she needs to step up and do it, she needs to bear it so they don’t have to. The roan/Clarke scenes were a good touch especially when they are discussing how to keep peace and she says ‘I was going to sacrifice my own mother to stop alie’ which just kind of shows how much she has sacrificed which goes hand in hand with the scene I just mentioned.  The conclave was also awesome especially with the added betrayal of Clarke and how frustrating but also kind of awesome it was as a viewer.  Least favorite of season 4 is the constant on/off war moments 

Season 1 is last mostly because I love the other seasons more. It’s not a bad season at all maybe a little basic in the first few episodes but nothing compared to the other seasons. I loved the scene when Jaha tells everyone the truth about the ground and his ‘I lost my son moment’ perfect acting honestly! It was kind of a moment you realise he does feel it, the burden of being a leader. I think my favorite episode was ‘day trip’. Least favorite scene is probably The culling

Now that I’ve wrote this I think Clarke is my favorite although I don’t want her to be, I love Murphy especially since season 6 but most of my favorite moments are Clarke/lexa related."
The100,fb44mwy,t3_e87219,1576501363.0,As many have said when she became wanheda she would have needed to learn how to fight in order to survive. She fought of roan for a little bit but yes I agree she does seem to be really good for a character who we barley see fight.
