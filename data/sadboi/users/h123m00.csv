EDAnonymous,fffrcer,t3_ete7xd,1579890119.0,"Minnie Maud overall is really not scientifically based. What has proven to work for weight gain (while being underweight) is intuitive eating. Now for some people that means eating 5000 cal a day for awhile, like documented in the Minnesota starvation study. But for others that might mean 2000 calories. Many factors play into it such as hormones, exercise level, current bmi, your bodies set point, whether your taking any other meds etc."

EDAnonymous,fezxwrf,t3_eqw6z3,1579463120.0,"Yes I have adhd! I was diagnosed when young but refused meds cuz I did well in school and thought I didn’t need it. I would say it contributed to my ED a lot, which I have been suffering with since I was 13. I have some emotional regulation problems, which caused a lot of conflict in my family and defs fueled my Ed. I am also extremely impulsive because of ADHD, which contributed to it as well. I have bulimia. Currently I’m still struggling but it’s a not better with my meds (adderall) which I went on a few months ago, (also be careful I’ve tried like 6 meds and the side effects get bad if your purging or fasting or drinking a lot) I still have the thoughts but don’t act on them till my meds wear off in the evening , so it’s improve my life and reduced my b/p a lot.

With fasting sometimes I feel clearer but other times I get migraines (i also have chronic migraines ), but it’s not recommended to fast while on meds so I don’t really do it that often."

I always panic because unless I’ve tried smt before I don’t know if I’m going to enjoy it, and not enjoying food scares me because it’s a waste of calories. 

It’s so overwhelming to look a a huge menu, especially in front of other people. Also my mom always chooses the healthy salad option and complains how everything is fattening so overall it’s a yikes for me.

Then I tend to get snappy especially cuz i probs starved myself during the day so my blood sugar is low. 

I fucking hate family dinners out ugh"

fatlogic,fehhavv,t1_feh5r3d,1579116523.0,"This is false. We have adapted past the hunter gather times. Think of a child, they stop eating when they are full. The only time that instinct is triggered is if people diet, or calorie restrict. 

Our obesity crisis is caused by processed foods that are chemically engineered to trick our brains into overeating, and our more sedentary lives."
fatlogic,fehgy0d,t3_ep4l2t,1579116316.0,"I would say yes, this should be the case. Humans didn’t evolve counting calories. Have you heard of people getting fat because they ate too much potatoes, chicken, kale, fruit etc? Most people who are obese are eating processed food that is chemically engineered for trick out brain to ignore hunger signals and leave people craving more. 

I am not arguing with CICO, I am just stating that it’s a lot harder to overdo it on natural unprocessed foods. If processed stuff didn’t exist I doubt we would be in an obesity crisis."

EatingDisorders,fe9sjda,t3_eo46af,1578941085.0,"You may have been eating more than you thought. Remember, your body can’t deny physics. Also, it’s possible that you don’t need as much calories as some people. I’ve had my metabolism measured at the hospital (lol during a lab tour at children’s hospital I volunteered to do it and it was so cool) and if I were to lay in bed all all and do nothing, I would need only about 1400 calories which seems low, I mean I’m 5’7, but apparently it’s average. With my current level of exercise / daily activity I need about 2000-2100. So it could also be your exercise level. 

That being said, try to not focus on calories and just stop eating when your full. Eat slowly, and if your hungry and hour later you know you didn’t eat enough at your last meal. You won’t gain weight if you eat what your body needs"

EatingDisorders,fe4aja1,t3_enrty2,1578857328.0,"Could be a case of bad anxiety combined with his OCD that slowly developed into him using food as coping method. He’s pretty young though so it’s hard to tell. I was a very very picky eater up till the age of about 14? My friends mom actually accused me of being anorexic when I was 12. (I wasn’t, and I wasn’t underweight either lol). 

Basically what i think is he his problems with food may be more related to OCD,
If he’s actively controlling food to trying to lose weight because of anxiety from bad body image then that’s an ED. based on one comment of him being fat you can’t know for sure. Remember there’s a large component of problems with body image in an anorexia or bulimia or OSFED diagnosis. 

I’m studying behavioural neuroscience in uni, and from what I’ve learned  it’s pretty common for young kids to have weird eating habits and not have an Ed. So it’s hard to tell"

bulimia,fdnxe69,t3_em96zh,1578594784.0,"I starting dieting at a pretty young age. 11/12ish? Had feelings of being fat since I was like 7/8 even though I wasn’t. Dieting led to bingeing, which led to purging. I honestly didn’t think it was disordered at first, and wasn’t really a coping method. The first time I did it, my friend encouraged me to do it in the school bathroom because I had eaten like 1 cookie. It didn’t really work. We were on diets together lol. I didn’t try it again till like 6 months later after a period of restriction due to anxiety. Then I went through some pretty big trauma and developed full blown bulimia. 6 years later and Im in my latest relapse. I don’t think I’ve gone more than 2 months without relapsing fully."
