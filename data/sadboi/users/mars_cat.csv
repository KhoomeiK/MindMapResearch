AskReddit,flgo3hs,t1_flesizq,1585146917.0,"My husband got me into SWTCW as an adult. He did NOT warn me about the intensity of the Zygerian slave trader arc. That had my heart racing for three whole episodes.

First an entire civilization (Ahsoka's people no less) are kidnapped from their planet. We find out in the next episode that they've been kidnapped to serve as slaves. The jedi try to rescue them, but instead of being meet with violence and military action, they're met with psychological manipulation and become slaves themselves.

Obi Wan works in the mines and ends up silencing himself when another person in the mines is beaten for Obi Wan speaking out. Anakin is kept as a personal slave to the Zygerian queen because if he doesn't, his jedi friends and Rex will be executed. 

Just to prove a point to the Jedi, one of the zygerian leaders drops about 10 slaves into a seemingly bottomless pit, further silencing the Jedi. A even citizen flings herself off a balcony when she's caught trying to assassinate the queen because she'd rather die than be forced into slavery at the hands of the Zygerian empire. 

The episodes not so subtly wrestle with the idea of autonomy vs slavery. Anakin is directly told that he is keeping himself a slave because he's not being forced to stay, but he is choosing to stay for the safety of his friends.

At the end of the episode when the kidnapped people are rescued, they even mention that the rescue will not save them, as the trauma they endured was so severe and they may never fully recover.

That was one of the most intense things I've ever seen in a kids show. The manipulation, the blatant disregard for lives, the concepts that are barely discussed among adults in normal life. I've never seen a kids story like that one. My heart never stopped racing and I felt sick a couple of times. According to my husband (who first watched it as a teenager), he didn't even recognize the depth of it when he first saw it, but it's something I'll never EVER forget."

I haven't done many of the things teens and young adults do to explore themselves and develop personally due to self consciousness and I wish more than anything I hadn't held myself back.

You don't have to love how you look, especially when it feels impossible, but please try not to let your perception of your looks hold you back. Body neutrality has helped me a lot and may help you as well. Your body/face/etc is just your casing nothing more and nothing less. Next time you find yourself feeling down about your appearance, you don't have to try to convince yourself that you're beautiful but try telling yourself that it's just a body and doesn't define who you are as a person. If you can convince yourself that you're just an average person, you'll stop spending as much time and energy hating your appearance so you can instead focus on living your life. If you use Instagram, the account i_weigh is a great place to find support and information regarding body neutrality. 

Finding things that make you feel better about yourself can also help with your self image. Find clothes that fit your body type, learn some basic makeup skills if you haven't, acquire skills that you're proud of, etc. These kind of things can help replace negative feelings with neutral ones.

I don't want to tell you that looks don't matter, but they matter less than you think when you spend less energy thinking about them and more energy on developing yourself as whole person."

- help your daughter learn self neutrality. We hear so much about replacing self hte with self love, but that can be an impossibly huge step. If your daughter can't find enough worth to love herself right now, neutrality is a great first step. When I worked on self-neutrality, I'd list basic facts about myself that weren't necessarily exemplary but helped prove that I wasn't awful. Example: I don't hurt people or animals on purpose, I don't litter, I say happy birthday to my friends. If she can view herself as an average person, she may be less likely to want to hurt herself.

- help her find other ways to fulfill the self harm urge without hurting herself. Some people self-harm because what they want is destruction, so buying some cheap plates to break can be a safe alternative. I personally was always seeking pain, so I started holding ice cubes firmly in my hands until they melt. It's uncomfortable and painful for several minutes but it doesn't cause lasting damage.

- when you talk with her, show your concern without making it about yourself. Don't blame her, don't yell at her, and don't talk about her behavior in terms of how it hurts you. Say things like ""I want to help you, what do you need?"" or ""you are worth more than you realize right now"" instead of things like ""I hate seeing you so upset"" or ""or pains me when you hurt yourself"".

- Give her space for privacy while still making sure that you set aside time to talk to her every day. Don't go through her journal, phone, etc but make yourself a non-judgemental listener so she knows she can talk with you. When you talk to her, ask open ended and non-leading questions that can't be answered with just one word. Instead of ""how are you feeling?"" say ""tell me 3 things that happened today"" and then follow up by asking how each thing made her feel, what she learned from it, etc.

- I know I touched on this, but make sure all communication is non judgemental. If she says something you don't like, tell her why it concerns you without blaming or shaming.

- remember to take care of yourself! You can't fill someone else's cup if yours is empty. The fact that you're reaching out to get help proves that you're a great parent, but don't forget that you are first and foremost a person with your own needs.

I hope some of this helps. Sending lots of love to you and your daughter ❤️"

I struggled to hard-stop quit, but I set some guidelines for myself like ""I'll only pick at something that looks like it may pop, and if it doesn't after 20 seconds then I'll stop touching it""

My current routine is fairly basic: twice a day I wash with cerave foaming facial cleanser plus one to two drops of jojoba oil. I also use a thin layer of jojoba oil before applying any makeup.

These are a few things that have helped me, but keep in mind that my advice is based strictly on personal experience. I don't know your SO and I'm not a licensed counselor/therapist/psychologist of any kind.

Try helping her on a path toward self neutrality. Trying to get someone with so much depression and anxiety to love themselves can be an impossible task, but if you can get her to find neutrality in herself and her life, that's a great step in the right direction. For me, listing objective and indisputable facts about myself and my life has helped with this. When I feel like a worthless waste of space, I'll remind myself (or my husband will remind me) of the times that I've donated blood, rescued animals, or made people smile. If I feel stupid, I'll remind myself of times I've helped people learn. Sometimes when I'm really down I'll just remind myself that I've never killed anyone, intentionally harmed anyone, or committed any heinous crimes. Helping your SO find indesputable reasons why they're not bad (even if you can't convince them that they're amazing) can help. If you help her see that, she may also be more willing to believe that you won't up and leave.

For self harm, something that's helped me is holding ice cubes firmly in my hands when I get the urge. Its uncomfortable and triggers the pain response that my brain is craving, but the ice melts before it can do any actual damage. If I start feeling like I'm going to hurt myself, my husband will bring over some ice for me to hold. That's helped us both a lot because now I don't damage myself, he doesn't have to see me damage myself, and he has something he can do right away to help.

As for messing up and setting off triggers, that will happen sometimes. What's important is learning from them and making an effort not to do it again. If you think it would help, keep a private list of triggers to remind yourself what to avoid. You can also keep a list of what helps if she is triggered (by you or someone else) so you're not as lost when it happens.

I don't expect this to solve your problem completely but I hope it gives you some new ideas and perspective. Good luck!"

Someone had painted a swastika on the sidewalk and I had to walk past it every day on my way to work. It ruined my morning every day and the city didn't do anything about it. When complaining about it to mh best friend and fiance, we came up with a plan to spray paint a 4 leaf clover over it.

None of us had ever done spray paint before so it looked more like an ugly blob than anything, but it was better than the swastika! My best friend actually told this story to over 70 people during a toast at our wedding a few days ago, if that gives you any idea of how little we regret our act of justified vandalism."

IWantToLearn,fbdyog8,t3_ecs2wh,1576774298.0,"First of all, I want to commend your attitude toward improving your health. The best way to start making improvements is finding some habits that you can implement and maintain. Understanding your realistic limits (financial, motivational, time, etc) is so important in finding a routine that you can maintain, as is striving toward improvement rather than perfection. From my personal experience, having the right attitude is half the battle!

Please note that this advice is based on my own personal experience. I'm not a doctor, but I have lost over 20lbs this year and gotten in better shape in a way that my doctor says was healthy without ever using a gym. 

(1) Find at least one exercise that you can do every day. The more you can work it into your regular routine, the better. For me it's walking. I don't have a car so I walk to/from work, but on days that I get a ride in I'll also make an effort to walk during my lunch break or after work. Start slow and work your way up to more intensive exercise. If you only start with 10 or 15 minutes of exercise per day, that's still improvement!

(2) Find an exercise that you can do with other people. This might be something you don't do as often but can look forward to. See if you can join a club for a sport or physical activity that you enjoy.

(3) Meal prep has helped me SO MUCH in getting in better shape and managing my health (as well as managing my food spending/food waste). I try to prep 3 meals for the week (breakfasts, lunches, and dinners) and I try to include the big nutritional groups in each meal (protein, fruit/vegetables, and a healthy grain/starch). Feel free to PM me for some more details on what I do, but keep in mind that there are so many different ways to prep meals and what works for me may not work for you. I get a lot of meal prep inspiration from r/mealprepsunday and r/meatlessmealprep. The best advice universal advice I can give for prepping food is get some good, microwave safe containers. I have a set that I got for $10 at Walmart and they're some of my most useful and versatile containers.

Remember: your goal should be improvement and maintenance. Don't focus too much on what other people look like or their successes/failures. Your on your own journey, and the only person you need to be better than is your past self. Good luck, I'm rooting for you!

If you hurt someone unintentionally, don't be defensive. You can explain your intent but you should always apologize for your impact, do what you can to make it better in the moment, and resolve to improve your actions/words in the future.

If you eat a bunch of these, don't proceed to go to a party, drink too much, and throw up. The hot sauce in reverse looks a lot like blood and your drunk friends will certainly start panicking."

mentalhealth,f95kslk,t3_e3xejd,1575129930.0,"I work with college students for a living, and your concerns are not at all uncommon. One thing I've done with students before is work out weekly plans where we plan out their time to be in classes, where/when they'll do homework, what time they should get to sleep, and time for them to use however they want (social time, Netflix, hobbies, working out, self care, etc).

I always use a weekly planner sheet that lists times in half hour blocks from 7am-11pm, but I've seen students adapt that to excel spreadsheets or their Google calendar. It's a helpful tool in visualizing how much time you have in the day and figuring out how you're going to use it productively before the day starts.

Another thing I can suggest if you don't already do this is try to do your homework outside of your home. Many people get easily distracted/tired in their own house and find it hard to be productive. If there's a library, quiet coffee shop, or peaceful lounge that you can use, get as much work done there as you can so you don't have to worry about your work in your own home."

mentalhealth,f7uyzbv,t3_dxntos,1574019213.0,"Before I make any suggestions, I want to remind you that you've already done enough. You're not a professional counselor and you shouldn't have to take on that role in addition to your studies. You've been supportive and done your best to help. It's not your job to fix her, only she can do that. Just because you don't have a solution doesn't make the problem your fault. 

That said, you don't need to give up on her and can still try a few things to help her. Instead of asking if university is right for her, talk to her about her long term goals. There are many way to achieve the same goal and maybe you can help her find some of those new paths. Maybe it's a new program of study, a new school, or starting in a low level job/internship and working her way up.

See if there are any other people she can talk to besides counselors since counseling may take a while. Are there any professors she trusts? Any academic advisors/counselors she can see sooner? If so, suggest she go see them and maybe walk to the meeting with her. Sometimes Taking the first step along side a friend makes all the difference. 

Good luck to you both!"

That said, I do know how damaging it is to look in the mirror and hate what you see. I've been there for most of my life. The best thing that's happened for me in terms of weight loss wasn't a specific diet or exercise regime, but just a conscious effort to make healthier choices. I've done a lot of meal prep, trying to get good nutritional value (fresh fruits and veggies, protein, and healthy grains) in each meal, but not worrying too much about counting calories. I also walk to work every day, which I know isn't an option for everyone, but taking 30 minutes a day to walk or do some light exercise will go a long way if you do it consistently and regularly.

- Have a good breakfast. You need food to fuel your mental and physical energy
- Don't focus on other students during/leading up to the test. Their knowledge and confidence isn't relevant to yours at this point. Looking around and wondering who else is/is not prepared will only psych you out.
- if you can, sit in the middle of the room/row. There's going to be more movement around the edges of the room, so sitting in the middle is less distracting.
- brain dump: as you start your test, use scratch paper or thr margins to write down all of the important things you remember (important dates, names, equations, etc).
- double check your work, but trust your gut. Don't talk yourself out of a correct answer due to nerves."
