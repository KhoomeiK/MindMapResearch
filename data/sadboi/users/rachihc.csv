I would suggest you find a place more or less in between J.U. and the city center, so you can be comfortable going both ways.

 Then to BAN procedures done in the industry like [Mulesing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulesing) and other mutilations. 

Some, not all animals breed for wool will need grooming. Those who don't need grooming, like goats, can just be fine left without shearing. Those who need will have to still be taken care of until they die. But Grooming is different than shearing, one is kind and for the benefit of the animal, the other is cruel and for profit (many sheep die in the process). 

We can not save all the animals (into sanctuaries) already there and alive, but we can prevent future torture. The less demand, the less breading, the less animals kept in horrible conditions for profit. It will and is a slow change that allows the slow decrease in production and transition. You can find more information on why it is harmful for the animal to continue with actual practices, read or watch videos depending on your tolerance to graphic material.
