depression,f692zo0,t3_del3c8,1572734637.0,"It’s the worst feeling ever, when people start comparing. I actually think that it’s about who actually feels worse, because that’s how they are affected and how THEY feel, because from an outside point of view no one knows jack shit, even if it looks like the other person has more issues, if you feel worse and actually have problems or depression etc, (basically having and actual valid reason and not just being a bitch) then you feel worse, and if someone tries tu undermine that or make you feel even worse  by comparing you to others, just tell them to fuck off."
