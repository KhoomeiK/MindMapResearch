There were a lot of decisions made in the show that I didn't agree with. For example, I feel that Frank should have been eliminated instead of Kyle. Kyle send very smart and pragmatic with his decisions and Frank was very much a know it all without really knowing it all."
AMA,f3pqvgp,t1_f0zh1zl,1571063578.0,When you say ABA do you mean applied behavioral analyst? Otherwise I'm confused about how you're a behavioral therapist with only a bachelor's degree in psychology?

Honestly I feel like getting comfortable or used to things can sometimes be our worst enemy. I feel like it's easier to relaspe into negative behavior when it's all we've ever known."
confidence,f1z5znm,t3_d82qtd,1569835550.0,"Remember that you are not your thoughts and therefore the things that your mind thinks about you are not true. You get to decide what thoughts you believe in about yourself.

Be more appreciative of yourself. Think back to when you were a little kid and the dreams you had for yourself back then. Now, write out all of the steps you've taken to reach these dreams and what you need to finish achieving them. It sounds to me like you've worked hard to make a lot of your dreams happen and that you are on your way there.

Starting a new job, especially a job you really want, can be scary and it's normal to be nervous about it. However keep in mind that you were chosen for the job for a reason, because people believe you can carry out the job. Remember to take deep breaths and take it one step at a time, one day at a time. You'll do great. :)"

Maniac,f166dvz,t3_d7o2hb,1569203648.0,"Were there any quotes from the show that you felt hit you hard? 

Here are two that I wrote down that I felt really capture part of what it's like to have mental illness (I wish I had written down more):

Dr. Mantelray: ""That's just your brain lying to your mind and your mind was listening.""

Owen: ""What's wrong isn't that I'm sick. It's that I don't matter."""
Maniac,f165rsf,t1_f14qgr9,1569203204.0,Yeah I feel like this is a show that everyone should watch because it shows the reality of mental illness but in a way that I feel anyone could relate to.

mentalhealth,f12m89m,t3_d7mknj,1569142760.0,"I think your depression has resurfaced and is causing you to take self sabotaging decisions that you will, or are already, going to regret.

From what you described, it doesn't sound like you were completely ready to jump into a serious romantic relationship very little after you were released from the hospital. 

Maybe you could have handled the relationship if the rape of your partner and the subsequent impact it had on her and your relationship hadn't happened. However, it seems like you took a lot of your partner's PTSD reactions from the rape to heart and allowed it to impact your sense of self worth and value. This lack of self worth and value seems to be the catalyst for all of the other self sabotaging you took on with other people in your life.

Self sabotage is extremely difficult to tackle because it is very much tied to the thought in your mind that keeps telling you're not good enough and it almost feels like it is subconscious.

I think you should consider getting back on your meds again and work on trying to regain your sense of self again like you had when you were discharged from the hospital. Once you get started ob a medication regime, it is really important that you don't stop it, unless under the direction of your doctor. Focus on yourself, what you want to do with your life and where you want to be and how to get there. 

Don't let your negative feelings overwhelm you and cause you to take drastic actions like cutting off contact with all your friends. Instead, take the time to observe your thoughts when these feelings arise and try to figure out where it's coming from and whether it really is a good idea to take this decision or not. 

I really don't think you should cut your family off. Based off the fact that your parents let you live with them until you got back on your feet again following your discharge, I think they care about you and would want the best for you. 

These are just my thoughts since I don't personally know you. None of it is meant as a judgement, I am just speaking from my personal experience and my observations from what you posted. I hope you found this helpful."
mentalhealth,f12gj0o,t3_d7kpdz,1569140047.0,"Has this ever happened to you before? Did anything particularly traumatic/stressful/unexpected happen to you right before this started happening?

Are there any similarities between what caused your depression/anxiety last year and two weeks ago?

It may be your depression resurfacing again. One of the symptoms of depression can include difficulty in concentrating and moving/speaking so slowly that other people may notice."
