In Hitch-22, he was writing essays comparing multiple anthologies of history around age 12 I believe? He continued writing essays his entire life, and it definitely showed almost as if he had a superpower with facts and details.

I'm 27 and basically wasted my entire teenage years on the computer/xbox. It wasnt until something stronger than the pull of gaming came along that I began to prioritize differently. He's lucky to have you, someone who loves him despite the time he's burning online in a fantasy land. As long as you continue to be there despite this addiction, he has no motivation to stop.

If you put it out there in the open, that the relationship is on thin ice, there is a good chance he doesn't budge; that's the power of addiction. If you decide to leave he may hit rock bottom and eventually realize his behavior is unsustainable; the teenage years are gone and it's time to move on, or he might indulge more until he causes more problems for himself (work, etc). Hopefully at some point he will know what he's doing to himself and what he's done to you. 

It might take time for him to straighten his goals out, maybe more than you hope. Gaming is an escape for many including myself. 

Tired? Gaming will wake me up.
Can't sleep? One match will help.
Anxious about life? Let me take control of THIS part of my life.

I've had to accept that I cannot play for simple leisure because once I'm hooked in, I can go for an entire day non-stop. I only need to give myself an excuse to start. Friends disagree and say I shouldn't punish myself, or that I just need discipline. To me, discipline is partially knowing your weaknesses and not giving in to them.

Sorry to divert, the point is that no one has the same recovery. He may need to substitute gaming for something else entirely, and he may not figure out what that is right away. You can be supportive of this though! What is very important is that he actually wants to replace gaming in some way. 

TLDR; be prepared to give an ultimatum, to leave, and if HE decides he wants to change, be prepared to wait as he figures himself out. 

Don't hesitate to message if you want to chat. Good luck. You sound like a very caring person, coming here shows that and then some."

Okay, I see how quickly people can be swayed into following very complex theories, while doing very little research of their own. What started for me, laughing at ""Big Red"" (very serious, aggressive feminist) videos turned into anti-SJW content. I'm not a racist but the flawed, provocative logic behind these YouTubers who appear to be knowledgable is novel and can be imagined as feasible. I didn't know the name of the Great Replacement Theory, or it's roots, I \*simply\* (being the key word) watched enough content, which was carefully edited and trimmed for the targetted audience; that was enough for my imagination to create the image of Europe being assimilated.

Getting the rest of the world on par with the developed nations of the world is a monumental task without a perfect solution.

I also enjoy his ""London, Paris is a shithole"" videos because you can see the clear signs of cultural collapse/takeover, while most media outlets appeal to the diversity argument. I believe that OVERALL, westerners are the most tolerant people. Sure there are bigots everywhere, and many inhabit the west, but we are not the enemy.

This is my own experience, although it is my own small, personal sample size mixed what I find interesting online. I find people like Paul Joseph Watson both admirable in his courage to make provocative claims that I find somewhat truthful and resonate with my fears and gut feelings (ie. Not all cultures are equal/cultural relativism is toxic).

2) She needed to love herself more. And didnt need me to call her beautiful or to look at her in that doe-eyed manner that shows how amazing, beautiful, stunning a person is.

I respect your opinion, however there are as I've discovered, MANY circumstantial factors that go beyond theories of faulty wiring (believe me I had the same idea for a period of time). Mental illness on both our parts, both working jobs we hate and not enough emotional support from me, while she was paying the bills. We were essentially roommates at that point.

These two guys in the span of 6 weeks made her feel how she wanted to feel, sexy, understood, supported. How I had used to be, what I had forgotten was integral to our relationship and her peace of mind.
