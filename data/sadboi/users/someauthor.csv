From the conclusion:  

>  From a mechanistic perspective, there are two broad reasons for an increasing number of non-malarial applications. The lysosomotropic, immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory potentials of chronic low-dose therapy appear to play a major role in rheumatologic diseases, CVD, CKD, dermatological and infectious diseases, and so on. At the same time, high doses of these analogues with prominent effects on autophagy and apoptosis processes are leveraged for their application in oncology. With the recent clarifications of the risk of retinal toxicity and the related dosing recommendations by the American Academy of Ophthalmology, it appears that these analogues are ready for a new chapter in their life.  

There are 99 supporting references  for novel uses for hydroxychloroquine."

Of ***course*** they could have stopped it. The RCMP/CSIS can track people with their mobile phones because we all carry GPS devices on us, *with* cameras. Everyone ought to know by now, the RCMP can listen to our phones and look through our cameras anytime they want, and we couldn't tell.  We hear that terrorists are on watch lists - we *know* they can see these things and prevent them.  

However; if they stopped this guy right away, and the death toll was just 1, people could not have been worked into a fervor over gun control. If 20-30 people lose their lives, including kids, and a cop?! Done deal - normies will be clamoring for more restrictions.
