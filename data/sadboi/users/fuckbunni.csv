AskReddit,f27l4ll,t3_dc9fyc,1570040658.0,"So I‚Äôm not a guy, but I‚Äôm bisexual and my first couple relationships were with women. Here‚Äôs my crazy women story:

We were obviously into each other in high school and spent almost every day together. Her parents were Afghan so she kinda didn‚Äôt admit to herself she was into me. And one night I went to her house to sleep over, she admitted her feelings for me and I was so relieved because I felt the same way and we started having sex... her MOM WALKS IN ON US. 

She starts yelling and screaming at me and her, my friend is crying, I‚Äôm butt ass naked and getting hit with a broom by my best friends mother while being told I‚Äôm the devil in Farci. 

I had to run outside without clothes on. I only have on a tshirt I managed to grab at this point and am locked outside. Luckily it‚Äôs like midnight so most people aren‚Äôt awake or outside, and even more lucky for me our pot dealer literally lives across the street from her. I run to his house and bang on the door, trying to cover my fucking ass and private area. He opens and let‚Äôs me in, gives me sweat pants and I had to explain what happened.

My friend later comes to our dealers house. We talk and she‚Äôs crying saying her mother said she‚Äôs going to tell her father when he gets back in the country and they will send her to Afghanistan to live with her aunt. She was born and raised here and is terrified and upset at the thought and crying on my shoulder.

I tell her to come stay with me. She agrees. I‚Äôm living with my father at this point and call him in the morning and explain what happened. He said she can stay in the spare bedroom no problem. 

I go with her to get her stuff, along with some of our male friends because her brother is aggressive and have broken her nose in the past. We get her shit and leave. I tell her it‚Äôll be okay and I‚Äôm so sorry but I‚Äôm here for here because I love her and I‚Äôve been in love with her for a long time. She tells me the same, she‚Äôs been in love with me too and is just relieved to get out of that house and be with me.

We are together for two years, get our own place, we made supper happy and everything is great. Then I started finding out she‚Äôs cheating on me. I tell her it‚Äôs fine, if she wants an open relationship we can do that,... I understand I‚Äôm the only woman she‚Äôs been with so she might need to experience other sexual partners and I tell her if Th Ars not it and she wants to break up then that‚Äôs fine too, her coming out was very traumatic and I‚Äôm sure being with me can stir up those feelings. But no matter what I want to stay friends because I love her and she means a lot to me.

We end up breaking up a few months later, turns out she wanted to see other people but didn‚Äôt want to break up with me. She wanted to stay with me and be able to sleep with other people, but I couldn‚Äôt.

Then, almost a year later, I start a relationship with my now husband. Her and I reconnect and start hanging out as friends. But she starts trying to get with me behind my boyfriends back. I keep telling her I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm not going to cheat on him and if she keeps it up we can‚Äôt stay friends. She agrees.

She‚Äôs in and out of relationships with guys and girls the next year and still hanging out with me, I‚Äôm in the same relationship. 

One day we‚Äôre all hanging out, me, my boyfriend, her, she had spent The night.  he leaves for work in the morning . I wake up to her in my bed touching me. I freak out and tell her ty at wasn‚Äôt cool and she leaves angry. I try calling her to talk about it and she won‚Äôt answer. We stop talking.

Literally YEARS later, she contacts me telling me I‚Äôm fucked up. I went off and got married and had two kids with this guy and how could I? It was supposed to be her and me! She can‚Äôt talk to her family because of ME! She starts commenting on my fb pictures of me and my kids and husband and saying crazy shit like.... ‚ÄúI bet he doesn‚Äôt make you feel the way I did‚Äù or... and I‚Äôm not even exaggerating... ‚Äúyou‚Äôre whole life is a sham!!!‚Äù

starterpacks,f24198f,t1_f23kczh,1569942608.0,"Well to be fair, I don‚Äôt rethink the child who broke my sons iPad meant to do it, but because I allowed my son to take it to his after school program and he allowed another kid to play with it the other child didn‚Äôt be as carful with it since it wants his. The child ran with it and dropped it. 

But from my experience when I used to work in childcare, there were a handful of kids that either, stole from others, broke their electronics on purpose knowing their parents would simply purchase them a new one, break another child‚Äôs toy or electronic assuming it wasn‚Äôt a big deal because their parents were very well off and didn‚Äôt understand that not every family has the means to go out and buy new stuff when it‚Äôs broken and that not every family would be okay with letting their child break something on purpose and go out and replace it for them.

I think a lot of it has to do with the area I live in. My county is the wealthiest in the country and that makes people act like assholes. A child from my sons class last year came over for a play date and his family was very wealthy, he played video games with my son and my son beat him in the game and the kids got so pissed he threw the controller and broke it. 

His parents did replace it and apologized and the kid apologized too but it opened my eyes and made me realize a lot of kids don‚Äôt respect others property and definitely are not as well behaved as when I was growing up. 

When I was that age I never knew anyone that had ever broken something on purpose. These kids around here are a completely different breed."

My son isn‚Äôt like that at all and we a definitely not wealthy, but when I got him his first iPad a kid in his Tae Kwan Do class broke the screen because he ran with it and drop it on the hard floor.

The fucked up part was when she started doing crack and handed me a crack bowl, I thought it was weed. I hit it, realized it wasn‚Äôt weed and got upset. She still continued to do it and got me to start doing it at the age of 13. 

She let two drug dealers live with us and I had to buy a chain lock for my bedroom door because they would get in my bed when I was asleep and touch me. I begged her to make them leave and she wouldn‚Äôt... because they supplied her with drugs. And another one of her dealers we lived with for a while also sexually assaulted me.

She had two different hookers living with us at two different times, and a few other shady people. And our house got robbed twice from a couple of the shady people she let stay.

She let me grow weed too. This all happened after she moved me to Florida.

When my grandparents came to get me and take me back to Virginia I only then started to really realize how fucked up our situation was and I had a hard time for years cooping. I was pretty messed up as a teenager because of it all."
