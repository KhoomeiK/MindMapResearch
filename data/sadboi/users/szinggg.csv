ptsd,fo0exgd,t3_g4ee93,1587411884.0,"Outpatient group therapy helped SO MUCH with my PTSD (in addition to regular therapy) 
I would highly, highly recommend 
It covers so much in a condensed period of time (individual therapy, family therapy, coping skills) of a few months, probably what regular therapy would be able to cover in years 
Plus it gives you a community to feel seen and understood among people who know what you are going through 
It truly saved my life and jumpstarted my healing journey"

ptsd,fm8mkzi,t3_ftlxz9,1585852105.0,"I had one bad experience with therapy and didnâ€™t go back for years. 

Youâ€™ll find the right person eventually, someone who care about YOU. Donâ€™t stop trying. Donâ€™t let bad experiences keep you from finding the person that you need. 

I also used to be afraid that they would never get me or get what I was saying...until I found the right person.

Try to write down everything you want in a therapist or everything you know you need help with. Find options from there, meet with multiple people, and see who you like the best. 

Might as well, right?"
