I’d say to read through the other posts in the sub. Visit the other stores and learn from the comments about their store.

Overall, your site just doesn’t seem trustworthy. The .online domain will be a challenge to build trust. There are typos, poor product description format, three products merged into one, and more.

You have more hours of work to get sales."

We have kept our hat embroidery with Printful because of their product/color way selection and their different stitching options. Unfortunately, we've had some quality issues which we weren't able to resolve. Each time we have been told it was an artwork issue and our fault, even though the same design had been used before with no quality issues. Printful even emailed us directly instructing (not asking) to edit reviews so that the quality concerns were not mentioned. Due to this, we are looking for another option."

reviewmyshopify,fghszao,t3_eyeymg,1580792982.0,"The site has a simple yet beautiful design. Very Impressed!... Just a nit-pick: Take the 'Powered by Shopify' off of the footer.

Regarding sales, it could be your limited sku's, price point and/or ad focus.

From the home page to your collection page there are no additional scents. So maybe more choices or a different way of presenting them would help. Think less about collection(s) and more about individual scents, if that makes sense. An idea would be to take out the 'shop' link until you have more choices, letting each item have it's own great page that's linked off of the landing page.

Price point... This is my personal preference, but I don't buy a lot of 'expensive' candles. For me, $18 plus shipping is a hard sell. Especially on a brand that I've never heard of before.

What are your posts/marketing/ads focused on? Growing sales, brand awareness, email grabs, etc. If you have been focused on just one, maybe try something else or do an a-b test and see what leads to sales.

IMO, it's not the layout, copy or product pics, but it could be one of my ideas above. Good luck!"
