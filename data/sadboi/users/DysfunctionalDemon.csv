The disavowal of experiences is rejecting ownership of specific events, trauma, traits, and **distressing** pieces of information a person cannot actively process and incorporate into a cohesive sense of self. 

>Many traumatized patients continuously wish to “forget” their disturbing experiences without being able to do so. In fact, intrusion and avoidance constitute a vicious cycle rather than totally independent phenomena. Representing a “rebound” phenomenon, avoidance or suppression can counterproductively lead to the state of mind one had hoped to avoid ([Wenzlaff and Wegner, 2000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10751965)); i.e., an increased tendency to experience mental intrusions as well as diminished behavioral control ([Abramowitz, 2001](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11434226)).

Thought suppression has been implicated as an etiological and/or maintaining factor in depression, generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and PTSD ([Purdon, 1999](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/%28SICI%291099-0879%28199905%296%3A2%3C102%3A%3AAID-CPP191%3E3.0.CO%3B2-5)).    

 

# [Maladaptive daydreaming as a new form of behavioral addiction](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327011559_Maladaptive_daydreaming_as_a_new_form_of_behavioral_addiction)

 MD was developed as a strategy to cope with distress but led to uncontrollable absorption in fantasy, social withdrawal, and neglecting aspects of everyday life.

Studies show that users often develop idealized versions of themselves, with personality traits or preferences similar to their own, and engage in normal actions, such as socializing or shopping or express forbidden, conflicting desires (Gottschalk, 2010; [Linares, Subrahmanyam, Cheng, & Guan, 2011](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220465638_A_Second_Life_Within_Second_Life_Are_Virtual_World_Users_Creating_New_Selves_and_New_Lives)).

There is a growing body of evidence identifying dysfunctional forms of imaginative involvement, defined as maladaptive daydreaming (MD), which may be expressed through extensive book-reading, watching films, or gaming. 

MD refers to extensive, often compulsive, absorption in fantasy for several hours a day, which replaces human interaction and impairs functioning in various domains: academic, interpersonal, or vocational (Somer, [2002](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226088977_Maladaptive_Daydreaming_A_Qualitative_Inquiry), [2018](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322152657_Maladaptive_Daydreaming_Ontological_Analysis_Treatment_Rationale_a_Pilot_Case_Report)). This syndrome was found in patients with a wide range of DSM-5 disorders, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, and obsessive–compulsive or related disorders ([Somer, Soffer-Dudek, & Ross, 2017](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-25583-001)).

Maladaptive daydreamers may share certain similarities with problematic Internet gamers who play games to avoid real-life difficulties (escapism), and use fantasy to experience things that are not workable in real life or live out alternative identities through the game (Ballabio et al., 2017).

MD could be considered a behavioral addiction, because it is so rewarding that people experience intense yearning for it or feel compelled to extend and repeat this action ([Somer, Somer, & Jopp, 2016b](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299384352_Childhood_Antecedents_and_Maintaining_Factors_in_Maladaptive_Daydreaming)). Some report an irresistible urge to immerse themselves in a fantasy world immediately on waking or want to continue fantasizing when interrupted ([Bigelsen, Lehrfeld, Jopp, & Somer, 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27082138))."
AskDID,fr2cjco,t3_gm7p7s,1589834940.0,"Here's where the difference between an adult and a developing child become *very* apparent.  

* As a child, they are still growing and forming a sense of self to correlate into what they see themselves as. So as a child, without any clear role model to mirror due to a dysfunctional household, they end up having to seek elsewhere to establish that neglected role.  
* An adult however, lacks such diverse fluidity as opposed to that of a developing child, and isn't actively mirroring things to incorporate into themselves to establish a identity. Their identity tends to be already established with core values, roles, and such in adulthood. Unless, of course, they have a potential personality disorder that causes issues with that specific establishment. 

Then you account for the disavowal of experiences, which is a primary dynamic of how dissociative disorders, including DID, operate. With the disavowal of information due to overwhelming stress that person is unable to process. If there is no overwhelming stressors that render the person incapable of taking ownership of those experiences, then it's most likely that is not an Alter, and could potentially be mistaken as something else. 

There's honestly a bit that go into it all, rather than it just being *""Just a DID thing.*"" Not everything is going to be because of DID. Quite frankly, in regards to fictional introjects, there's a bit that tie overall into what may be perceived as actuality due to not really understanding as to what may actually be going on. 

## [Introjection (defense mechanism)](https://www.academia.edu/36412112/Introjection_defense_mechanism_._In_V._Zeigler-Hill_and_T._K._Shackelford_Eds._Encyclopedia_of_Personality_and_Individual_Differences._London_UK_Springer?auto=download).

Introjection as a defense mechanism refers to the internalization of mental representations attributed to an external object, producing a so-called introject, introjected object, or internal object ([Rycroft 1995](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1752-0118.1995.tb00761.x)). Introjection is assumed to be part of normative development and it continues throughout the life cycle. Introjections of external objects enable one to build mental representations and schemas of the self and the external world, and they include various cognitive modes, such as sensorimotor, lexical, and symbolic ([Pigaget 1954](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2006-09595-001)).

By introjecting new experiences of the external world, existing mental representations and schemas are combined and extended, and self-representations are reconfigured. 

**Introjects are also often distorted by unconscious fantasies, and followed by secondary identifications.** 

Whereas primary identification relates to early infancy when the self is not experienced as differentiated from external objects, secondary identification takes place at a higher developmental level and relates to the process of identifying with an external object that is then transformed into an internal object (Freud 1917/2001a).

Such secondary identification aims to reduce feelings of separation and hostility, and increase feelings of closeness, between the self and the external object, and thus it is regarded as a defense mechanism ( Freud 1923/2001b).

# [Identification (Defense mechanism)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314072816_Identification_Defense_mechanism)

Identification is an ego defense or mental mechanism through which an individual, in varying degree, makes himself or herself like someone else; he identifies with another person. This results in the unconscious taking over of various elements of another ([Laughlin 1979](https://www.amazon.com/Ego-Its-Defenses-H-Laughlin/dp/0390541052)). 

Identification most often has been described as a defense mechanism and is a mostly an unconscious process, but may also have preconscious and conscious features ([Schafer 1968](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-9125.1967.tb00707.x)). 

When using identification as a defense, the individual takes experiences with the outside world and places them inside to create new ego schemes (Laughlin 1979) or ego structures ([Cramer 2006](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-8608.2006.00459.x)). Identification, when done consciously, is often accompanied by a simple form of imitation and a modeling of oneself after some aspects or aspects of another (Laughlin 1979). 

In identification, the person modifies his motives and behavior patterns and the related self-representations in order to experience being like or being the same as the object of identification (Schafer 1968). 

Identification creates an emotional alliance with the other person by making oneself like the other by unconscious taking over of thoughts, goals, behaviors, mannerisms, reactions, attributes, or character traits and emotions (Laughlin 1979). 

As a result the ego changes in the direction of becoming like somebody else, a group, or a cause (Cramer 2006). **The function of identification is to maintain an affective relationship with a significant other and through this to develop and maintain self-esteem.** 

# [The Use of Transitional Objects in Emotionally-Disturbed Adolescent Inpatients](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02673843.1987.9747625)

Winnicott (1953) introduced the term ""transitional object"" and described it as the first ""not-me"" possession of the child, which plays an important role in ego development. He described the transitional object as a blanket, cloth, or part of a sheet that becomes extremely valuable to an infant under stress, especially when going to sleep. The functional value of the transitional object as soothing in the face of anxiety or stress is agreed upon by all authors studying this phenomena. From object to phenomena, the term ""transitional"" has come to have a variety of meanings. 

1. Transitional from the mother to the larger world of animate and inanimate object relations. The attachment of the teddy bear or blanket is assumed to result from a ""spill-over"" ([Mahler, 1975](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327185888_The_psychological_birth_of_the_human_infant_Symbiosis_and_individuation)) of the attachment to the mother. Such objects may then substitute for the mother and soothe the child when he is ill or falling asleep, or under stress. 
2. Transitional from the psychic inner reality of wishes, desires, feelings, and ideas to the external world of intersubjectively verifiable things; that is, from the ""me"" to the ""not-me."" This explains Winnicott's term, the ""intermediate area of experience."" 
3. Transitional from one level of organization to another. This refers to the object's role in evolving ego organization. Attachment to the object may either facilitate or interfere with psychological growth. The transitional object may be a catalyst for ego growth as it provides maximum security in the phase of new and challenging internal and external realities. 
4. Transitional from concrete to symbolic object relations. This is implicit in the infant's substitution of the soothing part-object for the mother.

There is also the potential for it being similar to the mechanics of Borderline Personality Disorder and stealing traits, or making ""Masks"" to fit certain roles as well.

> 1.2.1.1. Single identity salience and identity switching. The salience or activation of a single social identity and the corresponding suppressionof other identities has been studied in two ways. First, scholars have suggestedthat individuals move along a spectrum from identifying themselves as uniqueindividuals (personal identity) to viewing themselves in roles and relationships(role identity) to seeing aspects of themselves derived from membership in asocial group (social/collective identity) (Brewer & Gardner, 1996).

> Furthermore, a specific level of self-categorization will preclude self-categorization atother levels; for instance, if people think of themselves as unique individuals and focus on personal attributes, they are less likely to think of themselves asmembers of social groups sharing attributes with other individuals. One’s personal and social identities are functionally antagonistic, i.e. they are unlikely tobe simultaneously salient (Hornsey, 2008; Tajfel & Turner, 1987; Turner,Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, & Wetherell, 1987). 

> Second, moving beyond the emphasis on a single social versus a personal identity, some scholars have focused ontwo social identities that switch and alternate in contextual salience. Forinstance, some studies of immigrants, minorities, and biracial individualsexamine how people identify with multiple social groups. These studies highlight how, as the situational salience of one’s identities shifts, cognition, affect,and behavior also shift (Benet-Martı´nez, Lee, & Leu, 2006; Briley, Morris &Simonson, 2005; Phinney, 1990; Shih, Pittinsky, & Ambady, 1999; Shih &Sanchez, 2005)."

DID,fq1t5gp,t1_fq1ld0y,1589048936.0,"Bipolar Disorder affects the brain on a biological level in such a way that DID cannot necessarily entirely compartmentalize bipolar symptoms to just one person.

Manic episodes are also not limited to just euphoria, and some may experience more agitation and rage, anxiety and restlessness, etc. Same with depression manifesting differently, such as apathy and emptiness, whereas others may feel fatigued and slow. 

I was under a similar belief a bit of time ago until I realized just how differently it manifested for everyone. I used to claim I didn't have it and it was limited to just one person as well. While failing to realize just how much it actually affected me, but I experienced it so differently in such a way I assumed I didn't have it because I experienced it vastly differently than another part."

Bipolar is a very debilitating disorder, and usually affects the **entirety of the system.** Even though it may manifest very differently for some parts, and have different ranges at the severity. *For example, I tend to experience manic episodes with a bit more rage and agitation, whereas another part may have more euphoria and psychotic symptoms.* 

Bipolar can significantly cause issues with trauma processing. My therapist outright said I had to get the bipolar under control before continuing with trauma processing. Primarily because manic episodes would spike and cause severe destabilization to where I had to be hospitalized. Not to mention it makes the process a lot harder when manic episodes massively amplify the denial to where you're entirely convinced that you don't have any trauma to work on, nor is there anything even remotely wrong with you. 

I have multiple diagnoses by different doctors for a variety of disorders, including bipolar and DID, because I ended up manic and rejecting any sort of idea I had a mental disorder or trauma whatsoever. Waiting for the episodes to crash weeks-months later just to resume trauma processing and have it happen all over again wasn't ideal. I was also being an idiot with medication because my brain absolutely loves to tell me how it's poison and going to.... I cannot even put together the logical reasoning because it just makes. No. Fucking. Sense. 

Then you add in the psychotic voices, which are drastically different from alter voices. Psychotic voices you cannot reason with. You cannot ""help"" them. There's nothing to help. It's like a cassette tape on repeat but it's jammed on the same track that slowly drives you more and more to insanity as you hear nothing but distorted persecutory phrases slowly breaking you down more and more. So bad that the only escape from it is to have music blaring just to feel some sense of quiet.

Bipolar encompasses mood **episodes** that have to last longer than a week according to the DSM-5. Anything that ends before falls within relatively normal range, especially if there's a massive amount of stress involved. I just wanted to clarify that because I've seen a lot of people think Bipolar is just mood swings, when it's not at all and a lot more..."
DID,fpwrtzm,t1_fpwn18x,1588968813.0,"Thank you for the clarification. I'm not sure if this helps, but in some scientific resources they have suggested the term *Unification* to avoid further confusion between the two, and it provides a different way to look about it if you're interested. 

[ISSTD Treatment Guidelines](https://www.isst-d.org/resources/adult-treatment-guidelines/) 

> Fusion refers to a point in time when two or more alternate identities experience themselves as joining together with a complete loss of subjectiveseparateness. Final fusion refers to the point in time when the patient’ssense of self shifts from that of having multiple identities to that of being aunified self. Some members of the 2010 Guidelines Task Force have advocated for the use of the term *unification* to avoid the confusion of earlyfusions and final fusion.

Not everyone here will be able to achieve total unification. I am of of those people, and I'm someone who actively wants it. 

In the [ISSTD](https://www.isst-d.org/resources/adult-treatment-guidelines/) , it goes in depth that if you have a Axis 1 comorbidity (such as psychotic disorders, OCD, mood disorders) that the unification process is much more complex and those who have one may not actually be able to fully unify into a full cohesive sense of self. Which is the position I'm in, being as I have all 3 of those.

> However, even after undergoing considerable treatment,
a considerable number of DID patients will not be able to achieve finalfusion and/or will not see fusion as desirable. 

> Many factors can contribute topatients being unable to achieve final fusion: chronic and serious situationalstress; avoidance of unresolved, extremely painful life issues, including traumatic memories; lack of financial resources for treatment; comorbid medicaldisorders; advanced age; significant unremitting DSM Axis I and/or AxisII comorbidities; and/or significant narcissistic investment in the alternate identities and/or DID itself; among others. 

> Accordingly, a more realisticlong-term outcome for some patients may be a cooperative arrangementsometimes called a “resolution”—that is, sufficiently integrated and coordinated functioning among alternate identities to promote optimal functioning.

So it even recognizes in the ISSTD as to how not everyone will be able to achieve this. It's mainly just the integration of experiences that it's big about, so that information isn't continuously being rejected and disavowed. 

> A desirable treatment outcome is a workable form of integration orharmony among alternate identities. Terms such as integration and fusionare sometimes used in a confusing way. Integration is a broad, longitudinalprocess referring to all work on dissociated mental processes throughouttreatment."
DID,fpwmn9i,t3_gfy52p,1588966136.0,"There seems to be confusion with terms. **Integration of experiences IS functional multiplicity.** Fusion is an entirely different word and concept and what you're actually describing. 

No one's necessarily telling you not to live as you see fit, and if you want pure technicality the constant disavowal of information can lead you to continue the abusive cycle unintentionally if you're not careful. *For example, a child is confused and hurt why their parent is denying something that happened and not taking responsibility for what occurred. Instead they witness their parent blaming other things even though it was their body that did it, instead of actually owning up to what they did. This plays with the child's mind and starts to over time affect them negatively.*

Integration is taking ownership over things the body does instead of saying, ""I didn't do that. That wasn't me."" It's being held accountable, and it's not continuing the cycle of rejection. It's an entirely natural part to the healing process and doesn't have anything to do with fusion."
AskDID,fpu1gzw,t1_fptxls6,1588902643.0,"Right, so I only provided the other breakdowns as a gateway into a different perspective in a sense. Fairly sure I lost my main point writing all that because I do that a lot when I get absorbed into studies. 

However, I am referring to the Identity role itself specifically and what makes it that, which is why it was brought up in the pdf. That specific role is **set** as an adult, and the portion of the self-discovery phase and establishing a role has already been ""fulfilled"" in a way. 

So later in life, the elaboration process would be far more difficult unless that person is absolutely experiencing an overwhelming amount of stress that renders them unable to process external information overall. Which ties into the experiences of disavowal.

Not every thing we experience has to tie back into dissociation. This is only one defensive function of the brain, and if one is not careful, then it can become everything is being correlated to dissociation, when there's far much more to the brain than just dissociation.

# Elaboration of parts

So let's start with the excerpt you provided from the book of Treating Trauma related Dissociation:

> Elaboration is concerned with the complexity of a dissociative part’s repertoire of actions, including memory, skills, and sense of self. 

Key word here. Complexity. Let's go further back as to how DID only develops during childhood. A child is actively exploring their overall sense of self, and discovering what they correlate as themselves and what they do not. Problem is this occurs to a variety of parts due to the process of disavowal and the dissociation keeping these parts separate. 

So children are able to fully develop throughout the stages of a ""normal"" human child and become more elaborated this way. Through establishing social constructs, roles, sense of identity, shaping perspectives of situations, emotional intelligence and how they manage the emotions, etc. 

Now let's compare an adult. An adult is more ""set"" with what they actively believe in, what morals they have, how they view themselves, what traits they associate with themselves, what they want to be associated with, etc. 

&#x200B;

>It is developed when a dissociative part is regularly exposed to external reality or a rich internal reality.   
>  
>  
>  
>Recurrent interactions of dissociative parts with other people or among themselves extend their life history and repertoire of mental actions, whether they occur in the context of daily life or traumatization. Thus, these interactions elaborate their existence.

This again ties into the development process overall as a child establishes a sense of self. A person would absolutely have to be under an immense amount of distress to entirely have a brand new identity establish itself and go through all the stages of typical development in order to create the same elaboration as seen with other parts present throughout childhood.

Usually why it's more common to see single function fragments as opposed to a fully elaborated alter that can resume all the roles and such that can actively host.

Now if it's an ""elaborated"" part that is manifesting internally, yet can never actively front. Then there's more of a correlation with the possibility of something else coming to play and being mistaken for a fully elaborated alter. The point of fully constructed elaborated alters is functionality so they can resume daily tasks, activities, balancing emotions, and overall provide somewhat of a stable foundation overall. Obviously if there's multiple there's going to be dysfunctionality present with the consistency, however they still can retain that level to some degree despite the intrusions from others.

&#x200B;

# Disavowal Process

This is talked often among a variety of resources that go in-depth in regards to the dynamic of dissociation itself. Which is the rejection of overwhelming information. So the key point is there absolutely has to be some form of repeated distress to the person in such a way they are unable to own any experiences associated with life overall.

Our brains actively incorporate what we experience into our sense of self, and this can apply to whoever is actually fronting. So it's not limited to any one part. It can be attributed to whoever is currently fronting, and if something stressful happens if they actively are able to process that information that's been presented or reject the information entirely. 

Rejected information doesn't necessarily mean that it's rejected entirely. Some parts can take ownership over it if they have a different perspective on that specific occurrence. So in a way, this also can be applied when we are growing up and trapped in abusive environments. Where another part will see the situation differently, and has no problem registering that bit of information with themselves. They take ownership over it, whereas another part may entirely reject that information.

So that's a bit of rejected information that's not being processed to a degree a fully elaborated part is being produced as opposed to a fragment that once held a single function.

DID,fppo6g2,t3_get84j,1588805932.0,"This is basing off of a single YouTube video you watched that is a questionable source of information. YouTube is not a very good source of information at all and describes general experiences that literally every human being has the potential of experiencing. Dissociation isn't limited to just DID. 

Dissociation itself is a common human experience. Feeling detached from oneself is depersonalization and doesn't immediately indicate the presence of a psychiatric disorder. There are a variety of disorders that involve dissociation that can seem similar to DID, such as trauma disorders, mood disorders, personality disorders, dissociative disorders, psychotic disorders, and even things that can be physical that cause mood disturbances.

The dissociative scale itself can also be present among other disorders, and it shouldn't be used as self diagnostic criteria. Borderline Personality Disorder also has a tendency to score high on those tests as well, so this is better left with working through with a therapist.

Self-diagnosing someone with something also has potential to cause harm to the person if it's wrong. DID is a result of severe, repeated childhood trauma and only develops during childhood. It's often comorbid with PTSD."

Plus the Demon thing.... I absolutely understand. However, in my case it was both of us seeing each other as the Demon in very different ways. Loathing and rejecting traits, behavior, demeanor that we couldn't associate with because of how different they were.

DID,fpjbz1y,t3_gdsmx9,1588663051.0,"I respect that's your own personal opinion, but it won't necessarily apply to everyone here. However here's my own personal opinion since I prefer to use the term parts. I prefer to use parts because I take a more scientific approach, and I like to look at it as all parts of a bigger puzzle in a way. 

To clarify, in scientific research there's **no** implication whatsoever that there's any *broken* parts off of one specific person at all. It's multiple parts simultaneously denying having association with any traits, stressful events, trauma, behaviors that they don't take any type of ownership over as their own. Which is what creates the disavowal process to begin with. By rejecting that information as ""Not mine."" 

It's information too overwhelming for one part to process at that one time no matter who it may be that's out, so it gets disavowed to be processed later. So it can mean someone picks up the piece of information that was rejected along the way and takes ownership over it, meanwhile another part may not and completely reject the information entirely. 

You mention the dehumanizing factor, and out of pure curiosity did your parents put you in a position they determined the role for you (like telling you who you were) instead of allowing you to establish your own worth and healthily explore your sense of self without any negative consequences? I only ask being as this can tie into a lot of what you're currently experiencing if that's the case."

AskDID,fpj46xd,t3_gdrh1g,1588656108.0,"There's a bit of misinformation in regards to what ""splitting"" is, and especially regarding Fictional Introjects.

""Splitting"" in itself would be along the lines of the process of disavowing. So it is rejecting that piece of information that the person cannot currently process. Information consisting of unpleasant events, trauma, overwhelming emotion, traits they are unable to associate with themselves, and any information that person cannot take ownership over. 

So in order for a fictional Introject to form, there would need to be a reason as to why that's usually tied to overwhelming distress that person is unable to actually process. Also with DID, full blown Alters do not form all willy nilly at the slightest sign of stress. It would be more of a one dimensional dissociative part that would form with a single function, rather than a intricate, complex alter that has a variety of components that have set throughout the years. These dissociative parts can be present among a variety of disorders without being a full blown alter as seen with DID. 

There's been a lot of confusion with Maladaptive Daydreaming overall and Alters in DID. Where people who maladaptive daydream latch onto figures they idealize in TV shows, books, games, etc and can create a internal NPC of that character to play out in a idealized fantasy. It's a form of escapism to cope with stress. 

[Maladaptive daydreaming as a new form of behavioral addiction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6426361/)


> MD was developed as a strategy to cope with distress but led to uncontrollable absorption in fantasy, social withdrawal, and neglecting aspects of everyday life.

> Studies show that users often develop idealized versions of themselves, with personality traits or preferences similar to their own, and engage in normal actions, such as socializing or shopping or express forbidden, conflicting desires (Gottschalk, 2010; Linares, Subrahmanyam, Cheng, & Guan, 2011).

> There is a growing body of evidence identifying dysfunctional forms of imaginative involvement, defined as maladaptive daydreaming (MD), which may be expressed through extensive book-reading, watching films, or gaming. 

> MD refers to extensive, often compulsive, absorption in fantasy for several hours a day, which replaces human interaction and impairs functioning in various domains: academic, interpersonal, or vocational (Somer, 2002, 2018). This syndrome was found in patients with a wide range of DSM-5 disorders, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, and obsessive–compulsive or related disorders (Somer, Soffer-Dudek, & Ross, 2017)."

Oh yeah, if the person you keep claiming as ""her daughter"" is the **ideal** image of what your mother wants, then there's a major problem right there. She's **telling** you who to be, and never allowed you to healthily explore a sense of self to begin with.

Rather than looking into what disorder it might be, it would be best to instead ask what it is you can do and actively change. The disorder is just to gage an idea where to head treatment, but with identity confusion, you can slowly establish over time what direction that you want to head in, and separate the wants and pressure your family wants from what you actually want.

AskDID,fpawvkn,t3_gcevgd,1588457385.0,"Often children in narcissistic families are put into this position where they have to be what their parents want. So in a way this defiance can manifest extremely with establishing a clear sense of self.

However, due to the obligation to fulfill that desire from the parent, the child becomes trapped and confused with their overall being because their parent is slowly conditioning them into a role and telling them what they are, as opposed to naturally figuring out their identity themselves.

So this creates a dynamic where the child starts to self doubt their own being and what they are. Which causes identity disturbances later in life, and is commonly seen with those with personality disorders, such as BPD or even NPD. Mainly because that sense of self was so conflicted they never had a chance to healthily reflect and explore on their own identity, health and stance, instead TOLD what they were and how to act."
AskDID,fpagz3j,t3_gcb0nw,1588447966.0,"By not associating with a label that restricts one into a specific box.

Labeling parts as ""Protectors"" and ""Persecutors"" can unintentionally create a scapegoat and golden child dynamic internally, so in a way it can continue the cycle of emotional abuse to yourself internally.

It starts to become all the negative qualities and traits everyone disavow that alter ends up being associated with. Such as immense rage, lashing out of fear, destructive coping skills, etc. Which can lead to a blame game where everyone will automatically blame that part the first chance any thing ever happens. This slowly breaks them down further, and creates an echo chamber of neglect and isolation. 

They usually need: better coping skills, to unlearn behavior they picked up from abusers, to know they are inevitably human and humans can and will make mistakes. No one is perfect. Unlearning behavior that we picked up from abusers isn't something that will go away overnight. It's a very long process for everyone as a whole to heal together. 

The others also need to understand why the traits or behaviors that person may hold cause them any discomfort whatsoever. What about them is making them reject that part and ultimately disavow any sort of association with them. 

This is a crucial component in learning to work together, by looking at the differences and actively addressing why that part is the way they are, as well as addressing from everyone else why that part is singled out as a ""Persecutor"" and why they even labeled them that way to begin with."
DID,fp8v1f7,t1_fp8uhl7,1588403945.0,"Not necessarily no. When alters integrate, they are integrating experiences, traits, emotions and fluidly exchanging information between each other.

A brand new alter does not come about when two parts integrate experiences more fluidly. This is a misconception. What really happens is they are more healthily exchanging information between each other, rather than rejecting the information and causing a disruption to the overall process. So it may feel different and ""new"", but it's the same parts creating a more cohesive sense of self rather than a new one being formed. 
 
I entirely understand, and ask away. Haha I just read a bit on the topic and have resources on hand if needed."
DID,fp8qzj3,t3_gc0r7x,1588400136.0,"Absolutely. Integration is the process of taking ownership of, rather than disavowing experiences. So previously disavowed memories can come to surface without being attributed to a specific part."
AskDID,fp4nnor,t3_gba52b,1588303039.0,"A variety, but here's a few off the top of my head:


- **Personality disorders.** Ie. Borderline Personality Disorder has a bit of mood shifts and dissociation. 

- **Mood Disorders.** Ie. Bipolar Disorder has severe mood episodes that cause cognitive impairment that affects the overall memory recall ability. Not to mention, the extreme mood episodes cause the person to feel and act vastly differently and not associate with the actions taken during the mood episode. 

- **Dissociative Disorders.** Ie. Someone can have a dissociative disorder without having full blown DID. Having dissociative parts is very different than having autonomous alters as seen with DID. 

- **Trauma Disorders.** Ie. Complex PTSD has dissociative parts that can occur, however it's important to note these aren't the same as alters in DID. 

- **Psychotic Disorders.** Ie. Psychotic symptoms can manifest in voices being heard. These voices are very different from those of DID, and any interaction with them really does absolutely nothing. It's not a dissociative part to fix. It's a malfunctioning of the brain. 

- **Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.** Ie. Intrusive thoughts are something everyone experiences. Thoughts that are not your own are relatively normal, however the more intrusions that happen the more likely it can be associated with a disorder. Attempts to gain control over the noise can cause one to perform ""rituals"" to gain a sense of control over the self again. 

- **Factitious/Malingering Disorders.** This one's a bit interesting and I found this in the DSM-V:

> Factitious disorder and malingering. Individuals who feign dissociative identity disorder do not report the subtle symptoms of intrusion characteristic of the disorder; instead they tend to overreport well-publicized symptoms of the disorder, such as dissociative amnesia, while underreporting less-publicized comorbid symptoms, such as depression. 

> Individuals who feign dissociative identity disorder tend to be relatively undisturbed by or may even seem to enjoy ""having"" the disorder. In contrast, individuals with genuine dissociative identity disorder tend to be ashamed of and overwhelmed by their symptoms and to underreport their symptoms or deny their condition. Sequential observation, corroborating history, and intensive psychometric and psychological assessment may be helpful in assessment.

> Individuals who malinger dissociative identity disorder usually create limited, stereotyped alternate identities, with feigned amnesia, related to the events for which gain is sought. For example, they may present an ""all-good"" identity and an ""all-bad"" identity in hopes of gaining exculpation for a crime.



Then you have to account for physical issues being ruled out, such as hypothyroidism causing mood shifts, or depressive symptoms being a result of a deficiency.

Family history as well as genetic predispositions can determine how someone develops. Really there's a bit of things that can tie into what may be going on with someone.


Edit: Reddit formatting on mobile is absolutely atrocious..."
AskDID,fp3ddjn,t3_gb2y29,1588277350.0,"Our bodies and mind can only safely handle a limited amount of stress, so trauma is a result when an experience exceeds our ability to properly handle and cope with its consequences.

No one here can tell you if it's trauma since what's traumatic to me is going to vastly vary from what's traumatic to you. That's best for you to figure out and talk to a therapist with to determine just how it all impacted you overall. 

That being said, way too many people confuse what Dissociative Amnesia actually is. Not remembering your childhood is fairly normal. It's stressed in the DSM-V, that it's the **traumatic events** that are forgotten that is the most crucial part. 

> A. An inability to recall important **autobiographical** information, usually of a **traumatic or stressful nature**, that is inconsistent with ordinary forgetting.

> B. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

Mainly because of how our brains store memories. If you're not actively reciting information over and over again, then it's not going to get logged into your long term memory. So not remembering every single detail during childhood is going to be normal if it really wasn't significant enough or anything that really impacted you much. 

Now with traumatic events, it causes a significant stress on your body overall and immediately gets logged into the long term memory because it was very significant and produced such a reaction that it won't be forgotten."
DID,fp3bodc,t1_fp3add1,1588276509.0,"Anything physical works for me. Some people imagery and visuals help, but I'm the type of guy who needs physical and to see it right in front of me in order for it to stick.

So like physical worksheets to work on, actively venting to someone that's safe, expressing it through music or art, building things that are centered around the theme of it, etc. Something that gives me something to look at after and I can just vent everything into in a way. 

Really depends on the person though because what works for me may not work for you. When I used to live with my abusers years ago, I'd go on walks to get away from the house. I'd use those walks to ground myself more and look at everything around me. Like the trees, the ground I was walking on, the feeling of grass, etc. I stayed outside a lot of the time, or read and wrote a lot to manage while hiding all my notebooks because my mom loved to go through my room and randomly throw all my shit away.

DID,fp39uv8,t1_fp384w7,1588275608.0,"Well if maladaptive daydreaming is a familiar coping skill that's often used, then a lot of the time they can manifest internally that way as a way to bring the issue to surface. But it's also important to differentiate the reality of the situation from what we may feel is happening.

I've had plenty of fragments take human form in my headspace, only to slowly erode once I process the piece of information they are holding. Doesn't mean they disappear, it's just I accept that as part of my life and take responsibility over what happened. So it's now an experience I can say happened to me, rather than disavowing it and saying it didn't happen.

Rather than looking too deep into the visuals, it's important to get to what they are holding. So like what emotion they may be carrying, what experience, whatever piece that we may not be aware of that we couldn't process at the time. 

It can be daunting in the experience, but out of curiosity have you tried more constructive stress management techniques that may help more? I understand it can be really difficult with everything going on, but it can be really helpful just to slowly have resources that build us up more."
DID,fp36xmh,t3_gaxkrm,1588274153.0,"I think you are severely confused with some things here. Fragments don't form into full blown autonomous alters. Dissociative parts such as fragments can be present in a variety of other disorders, such as PTSD, without it being a full blown alter. Which is what separates them from alters that come along with DID to begin with. 

The reason a fragment is formed is due to the *disavowal of experiences, emotions, feelings, events, etc. It means you're not accepting that piece of information that occurred and not processing it as something that happened to you. Fragments tend to only hold one specific function, as opposed to the more complex functions that come with full blown alters. 

A fragment wouldn't just randomly form for no apparent reason. There would have to be something you're actively not addressing, or just refusing to integrate experiences into. And no, integration is not fusion to clarify, it's just the integration of experiences into a more cohesive sense with less dysfunction. 

*Disavowal means to deny any responsibility for, and is often referred to in scientific research."
DID,fopfexn,t3_g8srhq,1587960099.0,"I personally have little interest in random strangers on Reddit knowing what people's names are on my end.

* How you work.
* What triggers you.
* Who has what role if they have any. Ie. Protector, Child Part, Caregiver, etc. 
* Who's the most vulnerable. 

&#x200B;

With all the predators and those ""fascinated"" with the disorder that have come about lately, it's genuinely surprised me people continue to disclose a lot of information that can be used against people. Especially now when so many people are locked-in during quarantine and most likely bored.

This has been stressed here many times: **That people to please be mindful of the information they disclose.** 

Even so, you can get crafty at least and hide it in your messages that no one would really get but you. It makes people have to work, and usually people don't like to work generally and target the easier ones.

I see too often people follow what others are doing here when they do not have to:

* No, you don't need to sign your names just because others are doing it.
* No, you do not need to have a system name if you don't want one. I sure as hell don't, and it's not ""required.""
* No, you do not need to have disclose every system epiphany you have. Honestly, this seems really personal on a lot of what I've seen and is better left for a journal only for your eyes. 
* No, you don't need to say or act certain ways to ""fit-in"". It's a dissociative disorder. It doesn't define who you are as a person.

Such as issues that can be manifesting in certain ways, behaviors, actions, emotions, etc. So really there's a variety in play here overall, rather than approaching it at the surface level you currently are. 

Also, I, along with the other part that replied previously, am fully aware that all parts are alters, and that hosts are not forever. Quite frankly, you're just stating the obvious. 

It was never implied alters were ""imagined perfect beings"". There are a variety of components in play that need to obviously be addressed that go far deeper than the concept of just you dating yourself. There's so much more to the deeper psychological aspects that are being overlooked, as well as common behavioral patterns that tend to manifest."

You're just painting a pretty picture that looks better, and covers up the deep abyss of trauma, pain, and neglected needs the picture is covering up.

So let's say you're lonely, and you have no one. Instead of learning active social skills, grounding techniques, coping skills, and actually addressing the trauma that causes issues in general with distrust, fear, anger, emotions that have been repressed for years, instead you're providing a cover up that makes you feel like it's alright without actually dealing with the deeper issue. Which those unprocessed emotions will leak out slowly in our every day lives and affect those around us without us even realizing. 

We are humans, and biologically social needs are a need and can be neglected. If you have felt rejected your entire life and been neglected of that need, it's no wonder that we escape a little to cope with something we don't like.

Anywho, while there may seem as if there's no difference, wording is very important and the meanings can be distorted severely and cause confusion to other systems. 

If you were to define it as disavowal or dissociation, it brings about the idea that the part is still apart of you, however it's just very detached and unprocessed in a sense. So that it's still possible to address further down the line and healthily integrate that experience in a way that it's more fluid and causing less distress. 

If you describe it as creating a part, it can be seen as it becoming it's own new entity in a way that you become attached to what it becomes.

> Not only do they give outsiders a skewed idea of how DID functions and allow confused systems to believe that they can create alters to have whatever job that they want, these concepts also discourage a realistic view of alters as dissociated parts of one mind.

So in this case, there may be a bit of misunderstanding in regards to the woman ""creating"" a part for surgery. It's not necessarily ""creating"" new alters if you want to get technical. 

They are disavowing certain experiences, stress, events, etc that they are unable to process at that time. So it gets compartmentalized in such a way those issues can float about as dissociated parts until addressed and properly processed. 

So if you are overwhelmed with a specific event and cannot process that piece of information, it can be disavowed that it becomes a fragment with a single purpose. By allowing the stressful experience to be compartmentalized and disavowed, it allows a detachment from the situation enough another part can go without much effect. 

Could also be a dormant alter that gets surfaced as well due to the high stress and claims that bit of information as theirs. Could be the part takes on a single function of fulfilling the surgery and associating all the surgery events tied to that one part to carry the burden while the rest of the system detaches from it. However, creating a brand new alter like a NPC in maladaptive daydreams isn't the case here. It's a bit more elaborate than that."

**Unwanted Intrusive Thoughts**

Repetitive thoughts, images or impulses that are unacceptable and/or unwanted. They interrupt an ongoing activity, are attributed to an internal origin, and are difficult to control.[Rachman (1981)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0146640281900072) 

**Clinical Examples of Intrusions**

- **Obsessional intrusion**- repugnant aggressive, sexual, religious thoughts, mental contamination
- **Worry intrusion**- unintended occurrence of anticipatory thought related to threat of current concern
- **Trauma-related intrusion**- sudden reminder of past traumatic experience

**Characteristics of Unwanted Intrusive Thoughts**

- A distinct identifiable cognitive event. 
- Unwanted, unintended, & recurrent. 
- Interrupts the flow of thought. 
- Interferes in task performance.
- Associated with negative affect.
- Difficult to control.

**Normal Intrusions:**

- 67% of thoughts deal with everyday life concerns (the good)
- 18% of thoughts may be unacceptable and uncomfortable (the bad)
- 13% of thoughts were rated as “out of character” or downright shocking (the ugly) [Klinger & Cox (1987-1988)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1989-00309-001)"
AskDID,fj63o5m,t1_fj5uey6,1583055103.0,"Actually, this would be misinformation. Bipolar episodes can come with a heavy amount cognitive impairment, which includes the memory recall ability being significantly impaired. 

Not to mention, Dissociative Amnesia is a disorder in itself and not limited to just DID specifically, which also means it can be present in other disorders as well.

> Measurable decreases in attention, executive function, and recall memory have been observed in patients with mood disorders.

> In general, unipolar and bipolar patients have shown impaired performance in tests of attention, executive function, and memory. Increased cognitive dysfunction often is associated with greater symptom severity. Source: [Cognitive and neurological impairment in mood disorders](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2570029/) 

That being said, if they have a bipolar father, it's very likely they could've inherited the disorder as well, and it can come with a variety of complications that need to be addressed by a medical professional. 

Not to mention, it's possible to have bipolar disorder comorbid as a possibility, so even if there is a potential chance for something else if they are bipolar, it can severely cause an obstacle with trauma therapy if it's not addressed and managed during therapy. 

Bipolar disorder is also stemmed from trauma, and tends to be ""activated"" when a child endures trauma. So it's in their best interest to see another medical professional if there's any doubts whatsoever. 

Also, people can feel very detached from themselves in mood episodes in such a way they do not recognize who they are. For me, if I am manic I am entirely different and do not have any attachment to myself at all, so it's easy to assume it's an alter when it's very well not and just mania influencing a lot of my behavior in ways I cannot recognize myself.

It ties into defense mechanisms of the brain in a way that helps people cope with specific things, and is a relatively normal part of people's lives. 

# Introjection

>Introjection is a normative process that results in changes of the ego, including behavior, personality, and schema. By experiencing and interacting with the external world, these changes enable an individual to develop and maintain a sense of self esteem and interpersonal relationships. As a defense, an external object can be transformed into an internal object to reduce feelings of separation and hostility, and increase feelings of closeness, between the self and external object. **Source**: [Introjection (defense mechanism).](https://www.academia.edu/36412112/Introjection_defense_mechanism_._In_V._Zeigler-Hill_and_T._K._Shackelford_Eds._Encyclopedia_of_Personality_and_Individual_Differences._London_UK_Springer)

There is also something else called Identification.

# Identification

>Identification is an ego defense mental mechanism through which an individual, in varying degrees, makes himself or herself like someone else; he identifies with another person. This results in the unconscious taking over of various elements of another ([Laughlin 1979](https://www.academia.edu/8125222/Consciousness_in_Biogenetic_Structural_Theory)). Identification creates an emotional alliance with the other person by making oneself like the other by unconscious taking over of thoughts, goals, behaviors, mannerisms, reactions, attributes, or character traits and emotions. As a result the ego changes in the direction of becoming like somebody else, a group, or a cause ([Cramer 2006](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-8608.2006.00459.x)). The function of identification is to maintain an affective relationship with a significant other and through this to develop and maintain self-esteem.

**Types of Identification:**

Identification may be defensive or developmental. Defensive identification is largely unconscious and occurs when the goal is to reduce anxiety and maintain self-esteem and occurs when: 

1. **Defense** \- The individual experiences or anticipates the loss of a significant other, and by identification with the object, it is recreated internally, and thus, this process decreases the anxiety triggered by the loss or anticipated loss. It also occurs when the individual wishes to maintain parental approval and to control unacceptable impulses, and by internalizing parental standards and prohibitions, he modifies his ego and thus is able to maintain self-esteem. 

2. **Developmental** \- In contrast, developmental identification starts in early childhood with imitation of parental attributes and continues in adolescence with taking over parental values and interests. **Source**: [Identification](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314072816_Identification_Defense_mechanism). 

Both serve as crucial components during a child's development in establishing a sense of self. 

That being said you have sparked my interest on a bit of the components of Identity Diffusion specifically, and it's given me some things to chew on. So I really do appreciate this. Haha."

Through trauma and abuse this process is severely disrupted and those parts stay separated through extreme dissociation as means to cope with the environment. 

So in a way, the parts begin to become more distinct and distinguished when they grow ""normally"" as any other child, however they grow separately from the other parts. So rather than traits being attributed to one sense of self, they begin to attribute characteristics, traits, preferences, thought processes, etc to their own isolated sense of self.

This is where the disorder portion comes from being as since they develop individually apart from the other parts, no one else has direct control how that person develops. 

It would be easy to have someone we all get along with. But in this sense, it's like you've been locked in a room with different people you never would've associated with before. Some types that you normally hate, but are forced to get along with because instead of having the option to ignore them, you're stuck in the same room as them and forced to shift your own preferences and believes to understand that person.

DID,fhnmgwd,t3_f41f5d,1581728904.0,"Honestly, fictive seems to have derived from Tumblr as a term, along with other more questionable ones. I just refer to them as they are, Introjects. Mainly due to the fact that calling them a fictive implies they are fictitious and non-existent. 

> **Introject** refers to any alter who is modeled off an outside individual - mirroring their personality, behavior and sometimes even going by the same name and visual presentation. These individuals may be positive or negative influences in the survivor's life; some are even fictional characters.

Not to mention, the word Introject itself is also derived of the term of Introjection, which is an unconscious defense mechanism in which one incorporates characteristics of another person or object into one's own psyche.

Introjection serves crucially for children to Introject behaviors as they explore their own sense of self and grow. So as a child yes, looking up to someone (even a fictional one), to the degree someone internally is modeled off of them would be understandable in very unpredictable, abusive environments when a child has no predictable role models to base behaviors off of. 

So in a way, they end up clinging obsessively to the only sense of familiarity and predictability it has in an environment that is riddled in dysfunction and chaos."
AskDID,fhdujxd,t3_f2n8cx,1581502391.0,"First off, if you suspect a disorder of any kind, it would be in your best interest to see a professional being as no one here can validate whether or not you have something based on a post. Not to mention a lot of what you mentioned can be relatively normal for everyone, however **severity** will vary for people and can change with a vast variety of different disorders.

That all being said:

**Dissociation** is a relatively normal occurrence every human experiences, such as:

* Daydreaming while driving a car as if on autopilot (‘highway hypnosis’).
* Blanking out and missing part of a conversation
* Feeling unfamiliar when looking the mirror.
* Having a dreamlike feeling about other people or the world.
* A sense of time slowing down (especially during a traumatic event such as a >!car accident!<).

These types of symptoms occur as a natural reaction both to traumatic events as well as high levels of stress in everyday life. **’Normal’ dissociation passes quickly and does NOT indicate the presence of a psychiatric disorder.**

**Internal Speech** is fairly normal and can be crucial for problem solving. It plays a central role in self-regulation (e.g., planning, problem-solving, self-motivating), normal language functions such as reading and writing, task-switching performance, remembering the goals of action, rehearsing person-to-person communicative encounters, and self-awareness, which includes mental time travel into the past and the future. People report that around one-fourth of their conscious waking life consists of inner speech, indicating that it most certainly constitutes a significant human mental activity.  \[Source:[ Inner Speech.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235916743_Inner_Speech) \]

**Trauma** has potential to be normalized to degrees that it may not seem to qualify, however this is best discussed with a therapist to determine the best treatment to be catered to your symptoms. Not to mention if there is trauma involved then attempting to process it without any outside help could cause potential issues. 

**Denial** occurs with a variety of mental health disorders, and if you suspect anything off. It's best to speak with a professional about this being as validating something that hasn't even been evaluated professionally can skew one's results for treatment. Even Doctors are recommended against self-diagnosing. \[Source:[ Denial](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261172974_Denial)\]

Typically it's very difficult to determine a lot during adolescence due to hormonal shifts, and self discovery on it's own can bring about it's own confusions. Not to mention Emotional Regulation can be a bit off as well, especially if you were never taught how to process emotions overall. 

Again, if you want clear answers as to what is actually going on, it would be best to have a professional access you. There are far too many possibilities it could be being as there are a variety of disorders that can appear similar but operate differently and have different treatment plans."

AskDID,fh02py6,t3_f0wfez,1581199913.0,"As someone who has bipolar comorbid with the DID, I'm not certain if this is the case for you, but it's entirely possible to normalize trauma to an extreme extent it just doesn't seem to exist. Mania especially can make this easy to do being as the world is an entirely different place in manic episodes. 

I didn't believe I had any trauma whatsoever before, and it turned out I had normalized so much of it to extreme degrees, that even the most fucked up things done to me I didn't even consider traumatic. Even went as far as to think that their methods of punishment were actually perfectly normal and that everyone did it. Not to mention it turned out we lean on the more manic side of things and that alone was causing issues with accepting the reality and severity of the situation. 

It wasn't until I casually just mentioned things that came up, that both psychiatrists and therapists helped me realize that it was actually very traumatic and I had normalized it so extremely I didn't even recognize what trauma even was. Which is in part why I've ended up with being diagnosed with DID a couple of times because I refused to believe I had it.

Not to mention I have to have both a therapist who specializes in dissociation and childhood trauma, and a psychiatrist to help with managing the bipolar. Because processing trauma on my end has spiked up manic states as a way to cope with it all, and it makes it very difficult to get anywhere when you're convinced you have no trauma at all and you start to normalize all the horrific aspects of it in such a way that's its almost impossible for even a therapist to get through to you until the bipolar is managed. My therapist even said this to me and had to stop trauma processing entirely until the bipolar was under control last year."
DID,fgv981r,t1_fgv6zql,1581141106.0,"In this case it wouldn't necessarily be alters, but more so one dimensional ""fragments"" in a way. They are technically still considered dissociative parts, but not as distinguished as Alters with how those with DID tend to be. This is where there's a bit of a difference with the dissociative parts with other disorders, verses actual distinct alters with DID. 

But, since dissociation with dissociative disorders tends to be a bit pathological and maladaptive, this is where stress can cause it to become hyperactive and go a bit overboard with detachment, which in itself can cause a bit of confusion due to the massive amounts of dissociation occurring to handle that specific stress/event.

DID,fgv59rq,t3_f0mlcq,1581137534.0,"Interestingly enough, out of all the scientific resources I've read regarding the dynamics of dissociation itself, none of them have really mentioned much in regards to ""splitting"" in that specific way. So it intrigues me where that term actually came from if the medical reads tend to tread a very similar route in regards to how dissociation works overall and all. 

They do mention dissociating (or detaching) from specific events that can hold specific memories and/or emotions, yes. However, those would be more one dimensional and hold a single function/purpose, rather than the more three dimensional alters would. 

Anyways, the concept that there's a ""core"", and it ""breaks"" or splits off would be inaccurate. So in a technical sense, every one starts with parts at a young age, and over time these parts integrate into a cohesive sense of self so that all experiences flow rather fluidly as opposed to being disrupted as they are with dissociative disorders. 

Now through severe trauma and abuse those parts are kept separate through dissociative barriers as a form of defense mechanism of the brain, and the actual distinction among those parts is in part due to them being kept separately yet continuing to grow as a relatively ""normal"" child would. So this includes going through the process of formulating their own thought processes, perspectives, preferences, sense of identity, likes, dislikes, etc mainly because they were kept separate and continued to ""grow"" as a normal human typically does."

DID,fgt1zii,t3_f0boa8,1581097369.0,"Honestly an inner world isn't limited to DID, and literally anyone can create one. It just happens that maladaptive daydreaming can often be comorbid with dissociative disorders due to the nature of it. That and it can often be used in a therapeutic sense as well for a main coping mechanism everyone can have access to. 

Its a bit of imagery involved, and you typically focus on what you want to manifest really. For some it's easier than others, and this includes alters as well."
DID,fgt1857,t3_f05ptb,1581096921.0,"I hope you realize that the term Predator and Persecutor are two very different things entirely. So calling a part of you a predator, or even a Persecutor won't be helpful at all in the long run if you want to see any sort of progression.

> Predator: 1. an organism that primarily obtains food by the killing and consuming of other organisms : an organism that lives by predation. 2. one who injures or exploits others for personal gain or profit.

> Persecute: 1. subject (someone) to hostility and ill-treatment, especially because of their race or political or religious beliefs. 2. harass or annoy (someone) persistently.

Not to mention, it's most likely they went through a lot of pain and struggle, and learned maladaptive functions from abusers that they very well may not realize is not appropriate.

If they are lashing at people, there's typically an underlying reason for that response, and it's best to work with a therapist to get to the bottom of what's actually going on so that everyone can move forward by addressing and processing it."
DID,fgri6x2,t3_f0434t,1581047433.0,"Like all parts, they come in all shapes and sizes. So even child parts can differ vastly.

DID,fgrhq9y,t3_f04acy,1581047103.0,"So, if you want technical terms, I could be defined as a ""Persecutor"" as well but I'm far more than that. I would choose something else to refer to her by overall, because constantly using Persecutor as a description is unintentionally solidifying that's all she is, which is probably why there was backlash in the other post. Call her by her name if she has one, or just acknowledge her existence without that label.

Now then, there's a high likelihood that she sees everything very differently than you. A ""raw"" filter of sorts may be a possibility. So your actions will speak far louder than your words.

A peace offering in headspace honestly isn't very much at all. Not to mention, a physical treat would yield far better results than daydreamed food. 

If you want to see progress, physically try to communicate by writing in a journal and leaving her notes about how you feel and what direction you want to head in. In her own time, she can reply as she wishes, and this way it gives her space and time. It also gets everything out in the open as well. 

It will also take a bit of time to gain her trust most likely. So it's not going to be a easy process and will take a bit of time overall. However, being diligent and showing her you're genuine and really want to help will lead everything into a better direction."
DID,fghk274,t1_fgha3b7,1580786587.0,"Honestly, I feel like there's a lot of context missing here, and what constitutes as what's perceived as abusive to you may vastly differ to what it is to others. 

Questions that arise on my end: *How did the confrontation begin? What emotions were you (as a whole) feeling before the interaction? What emotions was he feeling before the interaction? How was the day going prior? What usually sets these events off? When you feel anger, how is this emotion typically addressed? How does he address his anger? What stressors in your life may be feeding into this? What stressors in his life may be feeding into this? What other feeling(s) accompany the teenage part in addition to the anger if there are any?*

Not to mention, you managing to switch in during the confrontation to tell him who was fronting implies there was still some level of control over the situation. Of which you said yourself in your [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DID/comments/exckbs/my_partner_says_he_understands_did_but_he_doesnt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x): 

>I could watch and had enough control still to tell him he’s fighting with a 13 year old 

So in a way you were also directly involved in the altercation itself being as you still had a level of control over the situation. So I am a bit confused as to why it's become solely another part's sole responsibility for taking the blame when you were directly involved as well, and could've brought upon a different outcome. 

Also you mentioned:

>Then when there’s a problem and I can’t communicate with him calmly he yells and says he doesn’t care about DID and *I can’t treat him that way.*

>*“You do not have any skill in listening to my shades of gray explanations when youre in that mode. I said I don’t want to be treated poorly regardless of what personality.”*  


This insinuates (to me) there's a occurring issue with him being treated poorly when he tries to give any sort of his opinions on things, so honestly I really don't know the full context of this situation at all to make much of a reasonable observation based off of what's been said, because honestly it all seems a bit *off* to me. 

Even so, it's obvious that you two may need time away from each other to work on your own selves as well as mental health. So I do wish you the best of luck with your journey."
DID,fgh6fvy,t3_eyh9z7,1580777805.0,"You're ultimately still responsible for what the body does no matter who was out. Just because you were abused at a young age doesn't give a pass to excuse questionable behavior. That's sadly how the cycle of abuse ends up continuing. 

If someone else does something, it is up to all of you to figure out what can **actively** be done to make sure it doesn't happen again. Which usually means trying to get to the actual root of the problem, figure out what set that part off to begin with, and work with them to find a different way of coping that is more constructive."
DID,ffy3meg,t1_ffy2qxm,1580337913.0,"Yeah, same for us as well with daydreaming being used as a making coping skill.
