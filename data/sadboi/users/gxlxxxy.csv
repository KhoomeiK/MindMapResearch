And honestly, I was iffy about dyeing my hair this light because I was used to having dark hair-- navy blue, burgundy and my natural black, but there was a time I got so bored with my natural hair color and it made me look so plain. I couldn't get out of the house without makeup. So I was like, ""Fuck it. I've always wanted to have pink hair. I might as well do it now when I can."" My self-esteem was low already, and if I did butcher my pink hair, nothing could go wrong anymore. So I did, and I could say that it was one of the best decisions I've ever made. I could go out of the house without makeup now because people would notice my hair first rather than my pale face.

I think it really helped that I was with people I cherished, in a place I was comfortable in. The area around the shop also isn't crowded so we didn't have to worry about the people who would see us out whenever we went out to smoke cigs. It was beautiful outside too since we could see the city lights from afar. Since the people I was with were already experienced on tripping, they made sure that we watch videos that would elevate the colors even further. We also watched Into The Spider-Verse while on peak! I loved that movie so much sober, and watching it on peak is a whole different experience. It was like I was inside the movie. Hahaha. I just felt pins in my mouth and throat for a long time whilst crashing, and I wasn't able to sleep immediately because I had to open up the coffee shop.

AskReddit,epfbni1,t3_bujgas,1559193812.0,"A little late to the party but this is so timely! And this will probably not be seen but here's a little story:

&#x200B;

Last night, my best friend changed her Facebook profile photo. It was a beach photo, and she was wearing a one-piece bikini with mesh long sleeves -- her upper body was practically covered. The only skin showing were of her legs. Her pose wasn't even in any way provocative or whatever, she was just standing up. The caption was just ""Legs for days"". Earlier, she changed her profile photo to her previous one -- she was fully clothed standing up. I looked at her profile as I was finding the beach photo because I also commented on it because I was hyping her up last night. Beach photo was nowhere to be found. I chatted her to ask why she changed her photo, and she said, ""Guess why."" The only thought that went in my mind immediately after I saw her change her profile photo was this -- her boyfriend became a dick to her again and fought her about said beach photo. I WAS RIGHT! What's more fucked up about this is that he was the one who chose the profile photo for her, so it was done with him knowing about it. The reason why he wanted the photo down was because he felt like he was just like everyone else who would now see my best friend looking good on their screen. How fucked up are you?

&#x200B;

I am so pissed about men who prohibit their girlfriends to wear outfits that they look good in. I would understand if she was wearing a bikini to a wedding, or very revealing clothes in a formal office setting. BUT MAN, she was wearing bikini in the beach, and it takes a whole lot of confidence for us to wear bikinis in the beach (it's really not \~that\~ easy, guys). I hate that some men think that we only wear certain clothes just for the sake of it. They do not know that it takes a years to build up our confidence enough to wear clothes that we look good in, and when men fight with their girlfriends about the clothes they wear or the photos they post, it shatters that confidence that they worked hard on.

&#x200B;

Do yourself and your relationship a favor and hype your girl up when she poses a photo that makes her look good. Don't be that selfish dick who would fight with his girlfriend because he's the only person ""allowed"" to see her look good. Your girlfriend is not your property. She is her own self, and hell, you have no right to degrade her confidence like that."
