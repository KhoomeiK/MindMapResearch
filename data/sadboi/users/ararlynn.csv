i'm currently a writer for a small fandom (although i'm taking hiatus until online learning stops) and it's always so amazing whenever i get kudos or a comment. i guess it's less the fandom is small and more the fandom is near dead though, lol.

i also kind of kickstarted the fanfiction side of a fandom that was very big for a while. i wrote it when it was more popular as just being a game, so there really wasn't any fandom. there were other fics at the time but i think they were all x readers and mine was the first character x character story. it got 50k reads on wattpad before i discontinued it, but since then there were a lot of other ship fics of that particular pairing, so i was always quite proud of that."

personally, i'm using renpy because the danganronpa games function mainly as vn's, and renpy has capabilities to code minigames, despite it being difficult.

it's less of a matter of whatever is best and more of whatever works for you, or what you're familiar with. no engines are suited entirely perfect for making danganronpa games."
