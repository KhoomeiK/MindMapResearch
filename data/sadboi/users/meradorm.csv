(Also, tangent: dark skin color tends to disappear into the ether when people mix, the kid will virtually always end up paler. Stuff like bone structure tends to stick around longer. I have some Native ancestry and it's always been easy for me to pick out recently mixed Natives even if they were the color of printer paper because of facial structure, to the extent that I get surprised every once in a while when someone refers to themselves as white-passing. So realistically your characters might not be that dark depending on whether the Europoid people are swarthy themselves. Might be something to keep in mind.)"

Most favorite: Most museums are free due to Yale, the Sterling Memorial Library which is like seven stories tall will let in anyone with a university ID to read, the community college systems are really good in CT and I'm assuming the local one is too if you want to knock out some electives or something, good arts scene if you're willing to dig for it, really good Middle Eastern food.

Still, the people burning EU and foreign flags are not...going to be protesting for the most progressive reasons (the law is in response to the burning of an Israeli flag during an antisemitic rally, I would say this goes a bit beyond ""hurt feelings"") and I'm *really* not sure how to achieve the fine balance of protecting people's right to protest and cutting neo-Nazism off at the root. Ultimately I'm going to call myself undecided about whether this is the right thing. 

Americans generally have a ""first they came for..."" attitude about this sort of thing. If we don't let Nazis and the KKK protest, then eventually we can't protest either, is the theory - we don't trust our governments to block only racist, antisemitic, violent people; we expect them to use a law like this as a precedent to screw over other protesters later. Probably has something to do with the way they handled Vietnam protests only a few decades ago (see: the Kent State Massacre)."

Then I transferred to Uconn and basically had a meltdown. I'm doing much better this semester, but I'm really having to work out each one of my problems - first I had to go on the right drug cocktail for bipolar disorder, then I had to sort out my sleep issues (sleep apnea and delayed sleep phase syndrome meant I was sometimes sleeping 16 hours a day and not waking up for classes), then I had to work on myself to develop a schedule and consistently do things all day, \*then\* I had to get over the ingrained gifted-kid fear that there was something deeply wrong if I didn't grasp things immediately and had to work to understand them.

I am a functional human being and symptom-free though, and my only side effect was some dry skin when I started taking Lamictal.

AskReddit,fpxh22z,t3_gfsi0q,1588982508.0,"One I haven't shared before: as a child I was going on a  tour of I think Boston with my family, if not that then some old (American old) city. Newport? Doesn't matter. It was around dusk or already night, very peaceful and pleasant, I'm having a good time. So I wasn't already freaked out or anything - but it *was* night, when the weird stuff allegedly happens.

We're walking by a square and suddenly I feel like I'm being yanked by the neck - it's hard to explain, but it felt like I was up in the air, fell, and then stopped suddenly by the neck. I can see the ground several feet below me and my vision goes all weird for a second and then dark. Then everything's normal. I stumble all over myself and nearly fall down. I thought my dad grabbed me for some reason so I look around making angry faces expecting to see him laughing at me, but he's paying attention to the tour guide.

Then the tour guide tells us that people used to be hanged in that square.

I never told anyone because I was just a kid and didn't really have a way to put it that would sound convincing.

Might have just been vertigo or something - stress of traveling maybe, I never liked my family much and being in close quarters with them always freaked me out - or maybe I'm getting the sequence of events wrong, heard about the hanging first, and just had an overactive imagination about it. So there are a couple rational explanations. But I've never felt a ""vertigo"" like it before or since."

DungeonMasters,fpuetdt,t3_gfkoub,1588911135.0,"It depends. Are there problems between elves and humans already? There might be some aggressions between the two groups, military and political conflicts. Borders threatened, trade routes disrupted. More intriguing to me is this: How is succession to the throne going to work? People might be trying to get named the new heir. They might even be questioning the king's legitimacy if he's, for instance, too old to have another child to name heir, or if it looks suspicious for some reason that he let his daughter go adventuring where she's likely to get killed - for instance, people might start thinking that the king thought she was an unfit heir, but he had no legal way to remove her from the line of succession so he killed her. Maybe the king could ask the party to do something like ""Listen, this duchess is spreading rumors about my daughter's death and my possible involvement. She's trying to take my throne. Assassinate the duchess or I'll have you arrested and executed for high treason."" Or some other dirty work. ""I could convince the entire kingdom you murdered my daughter and have you executed for it"" is a great way to get a party of adventurers to do your bidding for a while."

Yanked the wheel all the way to the right, hit an embankment on the side of the road, was ejected and died a while later.
