I once thought as you did. But think about it, think about it for a good while. Was it the Autism/Asperger's that treated you differently?

No. 

Who did? People. Neurotypicals. Hell, if you really think about it, they're the ones who suck. (I'm not promoting anti-NT hate, just pointing out the double standard that they keep saying we're the ones with the problem.)
