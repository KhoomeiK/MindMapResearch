3. Respecting boundaries - I know some guys that have pressured, after being told 'no' multiple times, girls into smoking weed. Not cool!
4. Helping unfortunate people or animals - I was getting to know a girl and we went for a walk and she just stopped and gave a homeless guy the $20 she had in her purse (That $20 was a significant amount of money to her at the time).

Also, my grades were much better than I expected due to a lack of motivation.

The Bad: I had a few really bad schizophrenic episodes and, as a result, did things that I not only regret, but that I am ashamed of. I was horrible to an old acquaintance and basically ruined my already strained relationship with my siblings (both of these pushed me to finally do the good - it took me way too long to eventually to the good)

The Ugly: The schizophrenic episodes.
