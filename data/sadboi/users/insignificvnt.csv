The reason i want to figure out the specifics is because it’s so hard to understand what’s going on with alters, if they’re even there, or if I’m making it up. I wasn’t trying to get any kind of diagnosis, I was just trying to figure out if my headspace is really a headspace, so that if it is I could maybe try to access it or help myself understand what’s going on inside my brain.

DID,f3jm55e,t3_dgzqo4,1570954867.0,"What form of seizure/ symptoms do you experience? Are you aware of specific triggers? 

When I had this issue they were typically tonic-clonic seizures. I really don’t know if this is something that can help others, but as soon as I felt myself falling I would completely relax my body and try to focus my attention to something around me to keep myself present. My theory was that, because seizures are caused by electric misfiring in the brain, if I stopped trying to move then there would be less electricity firing (i.e. my brain trying to tell my muscles to move,) and it could help me overcome it. I only lost consciousness after the first one, and after that I was able to calm myself and focus on normalizing my breathing. 

I hope this helps, I don’t know if it’s 100% accurate. Knowing that seizures themselves were not inherently dangerous helped me to remain calm and know that I would be okay when it ran its course."

abuse,f26ijo4,t3_dbrjuf,1570012123.0,"Any sexual conduct between an adult and a child is abuse, even if the child encouraged it. Children are too young to understand these things, and that’s one of the reasons it is wrong and illegal. The way that you describe it sounds very similar to the way I saw my memories of abuse when they first started to surface. Almost like I could feel like it was happening right now if I thought about it enough, but almost like it didn’t happen at all. 

(In my case this was the situation) that’s the way that your brain processes traumatic memories. If it’s something you’re not yet equipped to process, you dissociate from the memory and block it out completely. That’s why it feels like it didn’t happen. But your brain still stores the memory for when it thinks you might be ready to process it, and all the sensory details are kept like-new, that’s why the memories are so vivid when they resurface. 

The only way to tell is to give yourself time. Don’t try to push the memory down, but try not to let it disturb you. If your brain thinks you’re ready, it will release bits of information, more and more at a time. This is a long process, and your therapist could really help if you do decide to tell her."
abuse,f26i1sh,t3_dc1sx3,1570011413.0,"This is complete conjecture, but it could be a coping mechanism that helps you “take back control.” A lot of people with a history of abuse or with mental illness will purposely trigger themselves, either to punish themselves (kind of like a mental form of self harm) or to help themselves feel more in control. Abuse can often make people feel like they have no control. By exposing yourself to things that remind you of your abuse, your brain might be thinking “now I am the one making me feel the way my abuser made me feel, therefore I am the one in control.”"

Any argument you have with a potentially sexual partner should be seriously considered.

ptsd,euuw9ng,t3_chd9vp,1564051702.0,"First things first, you are /not/ overreacting. These things are hard enough to deal with when you’re home alone with your thoughts, let alone in a public, professional setting and when you’re caught completely off guard. Your mental and emotional wellbeing come first, and you have the right to feel safe in a work environment. 

Without knowing the context or specific phrasing of the comment, (not that there’s /any/ scenario where that could be acceptable,) it’s hard to say what kind of action you should take. Involving HR, however, is the least of what you should feel comfortable doing. At bare minimum this is sexual harassment, depending on the circumstance it could be threat/intimidation. 

Not to say that it’s less important if you’re a guy, but if you are female then this is a blatant harassment. If you want to give him the benefit of the doubt and assume it was just wildly distasteful water cooler chat, you could talk to HR without using his name. You’ll likely at least get a company-wide meeting or e-mail sent out about sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior. 

If you do however feel threatened or worried that it could reoccur/escalate, I would report him by name. He might just get a slap on the wrist, but you’re likely not the only person who’s been made uncomfortable by this kind of comment. If this is a reoccurring situation, he should be held accountable to ensure something like this doesn’t happen again or to others. 

I’m really sorry that you had to deal with this, there are people who are just completely oblivious/ignorant, and I hope that this is the case with him."
DID,euu382z,t3_ch327m,1564036477.0,"Well I’m autistic, and I don’t think it’s offensive. I’ve never come across someone who was NT/abled using that term, I could see that being a bit off putting. But I think anyone who has a disability or mental illness in any way should feel comfortable claiming the term, it can really help with explaining your feelings to others, or simplify them in a way that is easier to understand yourself"

selfharm,euu1b9v,t3_chenog,1564035381.0,"Confronting past experiences/ traumas in an uncontrolled setting or when you’re not ready, can easily be retraumatizing. I’m really sorry that you’re going through this. Parents can sometimes mess up /hugely/ when they don’t know enough about mental health or how to safely encourage recovery. None of this is your fault and you don’t have to feel responsible or guilty. It’s hard to handle these things alone, or with under-educated support systems. I’m wishing the best for you <3"
selfharm,eu7rane,t3_cf4far,1563540822.0,"SHing causes your brain to release endorphins, which is why it feels good. This is also why it can make you smile or laugh, because your brain recognizes that SHing is what caused you to start feeling better. I used to laugh a lot when I went particularly deep or bled more than usual. I know it can make you feel crazy but it really is a normal response"
selfharm,eu7qloi,t3_cf3byv,1563540276.0,"I understand how you feel though, I used to sometimes catch myself smiling or occasionally even laughing a bit when I cut myself and it made me feel like I was insane"
selfharm,eu7qa15,t3_cf3byv,1563540013.0,"Cutting is addictive because injuries cause your brain to release endorphins. When you make yourself bleed, your brain associates the sight of blood with the calming state that is caused by self harming. It’s a really common response and doesn’t make you weird or anything. 

If you want to recreate the effect safely, you could try using a marker to draw red lines across your typical cutting site. If the color alone doesn’t work for you, you could also try getting a tube of fake blood online or in the Halloween section of the store and dripping some of it onto yourself. It’s a bit unorthodox but is a much safer alternative"
selfharm,eu7ouuc,t1_eu7niub,1563538840.0,"I really think you should report him though, people who work in any medical field (especially mental illness) have absolutely no excuse for treating a patient that way.

selfharm,eu7ohe1,t3_cf5aez,1563538526.0,"Withdrawal is a bitch. Going cold turkey is hard with any addiction, and that’s usually what self harm is. If you can wait it out and let yourself adjust to the change, it should start getting easier. I’m rooting for you"

selfharm,eu7o6nu,t3_c3r761,1563538265.0,YES. Constantly. They’re called intrusive thoughts and I have them constantly streaming through my head at any given moment. I also have a few specific violent fantasies that pop into my head every single time I think about something I did wrong or a certain thing I dislike about myself
selfharm,eu7nnm7,t3_c9eo8m,1563537795.0,"Oh my god I fucking know. That shit is so manipulative and controlling. Like I know that it’s not healthy and my friends shouldn’t /encourage/ me to do it, but making an attempt to take away my free will is NOT going to help me. If you want to help, then you should listen and try to nudge me in the direction of recovery. If you try to force me to stop against my will, I won’t actually have made any progress emotionally and will just end up relapsing. Punishing me for self harm is only going to make me feel even more guilty, train me to hide it better, and/or make me end up pushing you away and losing part of my support system- none of which is beneficial to me."

Rapekink,eu57cy2,t1_eu55vb4,1563471448.0,"Thank you I really appreciate this, it really is fucking awful the way some people have responded. My biggest concern is the idea of someone whose less comfortable with their attraction to this kink, being harassed for their curiosity, so I really appreciate the help with reporting them"
Rapekink,eu540xx,t1_eu52vk8,1563469425.0,I hate that there’s no realistic way for abuse survivors to connect in a way that is completely free of aggressors who just want to take advantage. It’s unrealistic to assume that any place that specifically acknowledges victims of abuse will be completely safe or free of abusers. I just hope that in the future it will be easier for survivors to acknowledge their experience or that if you have bad experiences that it will be somewhat safe for you. If you want to talk about your experiences my DMs are always open
Rapekink,eu4ys56,t1_eu4y77i,1563466202.0,"It’s fucking gross that there are people so desperate to take advantage of others. It seems like there is no where that is completely safe without harassment. If you are still seeking advice I will help if I can. I am a guy but I’m here because I was abused, not because I’m attracted to the concept of abusing others."

ptsd,eu4vw2b,t1_eu4uvvm,1563464384.0,Well I’ll be honest the way you responded to this makes it seem like you have ill intentions. I’ve told one friend about it. Both of my parents obviously knew about it considering what I said. The way you responded to this kinda just makes it seem like you’re looking for details in a sexual way.
Rapekink,eu4v7bx,t1_eu4ug1z,1563463946.0,"Thank you, it honestly freaked me out enough that I blocked them immediately and didn’t think to memorize their url first. I did however just have  someone literally just now message me something similar, I’m going to report them but I was wondering if you knew if there was a way to report them specifically to the moderators of this subreddit so they couldn’t participate here anymore?"
TeenAmIUgly,eu4puhd,t1_eu4o7be,1563460411.0,Also you should take into consideration the fact that you’re pretty without hair says a LOT. Like I’m bi and I’m usually not even attracted to guys with shaved heads. When a girl can pull off being bald it’s honestly like CRAZY attractive to me
TeenAmIUgly,eu4p8te,t3_cel0xu,1563459994.0,"Congratulations 💖💖💖 I’m so happy for you. I think objectively to the average person you’d be between 4-6/10, 5 being average. You look a bit tired but it’s hard to tell from one picture. Knowing that you’ve dealt with an eating disorder makes it understandable that you’d look tired/your features might be more in-set to your face (if that makes sense??) as far as improvements, your eyebrows are a bit thick at the center of your face compared to the end, you could try plucking them a bit in the center or filling them out in the end. Obviously wearing makeup tends to make people more conventionally attractive. Tbh at first glance I thought 5-6/10 but knowing that you’re an eating disorder survivor means that you have a strong heart, and that automatically bumps you up to a 7 💖"
TeenAmIUgly,eu4o7be,t3_cehlo8,1563459268.0,"You are so beautiful, you have really nice eyes. You definitely do look older than 16 but that has nothing to do with how attractive you are. I think you’re at least 6-7/10"

TeenAmIUgly,eu4nrfk,t3_ceq3zc,1563458956.0,I’m not sure what you mean by the caption “my friend again” but if you mean that this is a picture of your friend i don’t think you should be posting this here. Don’t u think it seems kinda fucked up to be posting a picture of someone else asking if they’re ugly?
ptsd,eu46138,t3_cemx2h,1563440251.0,Omg I know. I was a freshman in high school (14-15 y/o) when that became popular. You can imagine what it was like every day to be in a classroom of edgy teenagers who just found a new way to casually mock you without even trying
