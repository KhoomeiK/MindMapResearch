If I'm not mistaken, aren't both these neural networks, which are math functions typically trained with backpropagation (error reduction)?

In statistics, regression is used to fit an equation or function to data. Error reduction is then used to reduce errors. Doesn't that sound like backpropagation?

'in a typical neural networks, we present it with input-target examples (i.e. supervised learning). When we obtain the network's output, we compare it to the target, and we want to adjust the parameters in the direction that would move the network's output closer to the target.'

Depression is emergent from pain and causes higher cortisol levels and lower serotonin and dopamine levels.
