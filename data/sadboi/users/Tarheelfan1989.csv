Thank you!!"
Anxiety,fnhfdmm,t1_fnh1063,1586961351.0,I’m not sure I follow you.
Anxiety,fn8ghqh,t1_fn8g4be,1586741113.0,Thank you so much!!! I really liked what you said about the quick fixes. I have to tell myself about those and eating sometimes. That all a cookie or cupcake can be sometimes is “instant gratification” and then it’s gone. It’s better to just have one and not five. I also like what you said about not being angry at the gunk you have on your mind and not being angry about it. I get very distracted when I’m stressed out. 👍🏻
Anxiety,fn8be3l,t3_g02gqq,1586737911.0,Have you read the book The Highly Sensitive Person by Elaine Aron? I recently picked it up and realized I am one of these people. 🤷🏻‍♀️
DecidingToBeBetter,fn7uykv,t1_fn7qpuj,1586728162.0,There are good ones. I work for a dentist and she and our hygienist actively try to encourage patients and not shame them. 😊
DecidingToBeBetter,fn7umpt,t1_fn73yt1,1586727971.0,Glad I’m not alone!!
Anxiety,fn3e3p7,t3_fz6h45,1586618848.0,You are absolutely not alone. I’ve been doing this what if thinking since i was a kid. Soo hard. It’s definitely taken a toll on my relationships. The need to be constantly analyzing EVERYTHING. I hate it but am trying so hard to let it go. Glad to know I’m not alone. Hugs to you.
