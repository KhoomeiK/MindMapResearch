unclebens,flt1vuq,t1_flt0mf2,1585456793.0,"Basically followed u/shroomscout protocol. Great videos and instructions.üôèüèª

I inoculated 8 uncle b‚Äôs bags, between 1-2.5 ccs. Most were closer to 2+. Capri sun method, just stabbed two holes in them with the syringe.

I broke up the bags when they got to like 10-15% stiff ish and that sped up the growth a lot.

Mixed the cakes with coco. The ones that were the highest cc‚Äôs were ready within 2 weeks. The lower cc‚Äôs took 3 weeks. I actually lost one bag with only 1 cc. It just didn‚Äôt take. It was the first one we inoculated so maybe that was user error too.

The first batch of higher cc‚Äôs went into coco that wasn‚Äôt quite damp enough: they colonized great at first, but the coco dried out into a brick and it started receding. Added more mist and it started to pin, but not as good as the box pictured, just like a few random really big pins. I‚Äôm hoping the next flush once we rehydrate those boxes will yield better.

The UB bags that were left to colonize for 3 weeks bc they weren‚Äôt with the other ones went into really moist coco and pinned way better and more consistently: that‚Äôs this pic. We have 4 boxes of nice pins bc they went into sufficiently damp coco. We live in a dry area so this made a big difference compared to the 3 boxes that were dried out more.

So if I do it again, I‚Äôd inject more cc‚Äôs if I only do a Capri sun method to inoculate (2-2.5), or id hole punch the corners if doing a lower amount. Id also make sure the coco is properly moist.

I didn‚Äôt really understand the difference between fruiting conditions and just mixing the coco with the inoculated rice cakes so keeping conditions more stable would have made it quicker too I‚Äôd bet.

We keep them in a tiny closet that has a space heater and timer to keep it between 75-78 degrees, I used the same ones u/shroomscout uses. Don‚Äôt have a way to put light directly above the boxes bc of the shelves, and some of the lids are not clear anyways, so we wrapped the inside of the door frame with those light strips you can get from ikea and we turn it on for half the day, and rotate the boxes so they don‚Äôt keep leaning towards the light like they are in this pic.

Psychonaut,fi5bil7,t1_fi4ssnx,1582159305.0,"I second this! It is way more dangerous than you‚Äôd think.

You can‚Äôt see shit unless you have the light on, and the water is skin temperature neutral - it‚Äôs designed to take away your senses, so left with nothing, psychedelics are potentiated like fucking crazy and sorta go nuts.

Psychonaut,fi5b0us,t3_f6g7zh,1582158973.0,"I used to work at a float lab years ago and floated all the time! Also did float while on acid once, but I‚Äôd highly recommend against it. It was WAY too intense in a negative way, I got out and puked lol. Proceeded to have a bad trip the rest of the night.

Def recommend what others are saying, float sober first, id say 3 times. The first time you‚Äôre just getting oriented to the experience, second time as well, the third you usually can get into the ‚Äúfloat state‚Äù, which is very relaxing and rejuvenating.

If you do take any psychs, take VERY little, just enough to enhance the experience, don‚Äôt trip in those tubs. You can become disoriented and on enough psychedelics people could drown.

Before weed gave me psychosis I would sometimes take a hit or two before a float, but I genuinely preferred being sober while floating. Feels great when you get out. I‚Äôd float for 2-3 hours easily.

As for other suggestions: 
- don‚Äôt shave a day or two beforehand, it will sting in the salt, not terribly but it is distracting. 
- When you get in the pod, bring a hand towel in and hang it on the handle - you will likely get salt water on your face and it will encroach upon your eyes if not get in them, the towel is very handy to have at the ready. 
- Also in the shower right after you float, rinse your ears out well to get all the salt out. If it dries it leaves a crusty feeling.

Have fun floating!"

I am currently taking lamictal (epileptic mood stabilizer)  and have been on it for a year and all it‚Äôs done is murder my motivation (or hypomania if you relate the two). I‚Äôve been severely depressed since July with no hypomania. I‚Äôm thinking of coming off of it but idk...the neuroatypical thing you describe is what I would have before, some days (or hours) id get super hyper motivated and the house would get cleaned, id exercise, eat healthy, also maybe spend too much, take up way too many hobbies and yes commitments too, and burn myself out, but that version of myself cleaned up after the depressed self that would follow. I haven‚Äôt had that hyper experience in awhile now and shits a mess.

Haven‚Äôt found anything to help with the depression bc I responded terribly to Zoloft the one ssri I tried.

I don‚Äôt think ketamine infusion therapy has been very effective for depression either but I haven‚Äôt had much of it yet to give a fair answer.

I do have a lot of trauma. My childhood was full of it, so that‚Äôs why the cptsd thing sounds interesting to me. I feel like I was conditioned in a way to have highs and lows with a mother who would boast me up and say I‚Äôm going to change the world and the next minute shatter my existence and tell me how horrible of a person I am, and that‚Äôs very much a hypomanic and depressed swing, if that can be socially induced. Both my parents were fucked up and caused trauma but that specific behavior seems to me to have some relation to my highs and lows.

But I agree maybe I have both bipolar and cptsd. Idk if there is a concrete way to tell and yea at the end of the day it‚Äôs just a descriptive category like you‚Äôre saying.

All I want is to be at a functional level of ‚Äúok‚Äù, not a depressed sack of potatoes who can‚Äôt get up in the morning, do basic work, or take care of myself, and constantly thinks I should off myself to give my loved ones freedom.

Nootropics,fi280lx,t1_fi271pj,1582073595.0,"Yea the plus side is, it‚Äôs legal, you know it is fully ketamine. Also IV feels incredibly clean, consistent and smooth. I‚Äôve not taken K recreationally but I don‚Äôt think it is probably like the IV.

Idk if I‚Äôm gonna continue with it but I‚Äôm trying it out once a month for a few more months."
Nootropics,fi20we5,t1_fi1x306,1582068956.0,"Yes.

I had 30mg infusions for an hour each. With the lozenge, I had 200mg split between two hours. 

My doc thinks most of it was absorbed in my gut vs sublingually because I was only mildly feeling K in the two hours at the clinic but when I got home it started kicking in and soared upwards all night to where I lost all touch with reality and was crying and so scared, i felt completely delusional like I couldn‚Äôt trust my sense of reality ever. It was really terrifying. Quite a bad trip lol."
antinatalism,fi1zrot,t1_fi1xqgk,1582068244.0,"I see what you are saying. At the end of the day, neither of us have a substantiated argument supporting whether or not the world is neutral, net negative, or net positive. You *feel* that things are 50/50 but we don't have proof to show that in the same way I *feel* the world is a net negative, I don't have a way to prove that either. It is just a feeling, and our feelings are shaped by our own subjective life experiences, which are in many ways, extremely uninformed, because one person can't know or learn it all.

I think it is very important to appreciate the good things in life, I'm all for motivational speakers who make people feel happier and be a better version of themselves.

Whether or not life is a net negative, positive, or neutral is to me, a debate that can't be concretely decided. I'm biased though and do not think things break even 50/50.

How enjoyable is a delicious taco, fishing out in the wilderness, and feeling deeply loved? They are great. But do any of these outweigh the negatives involved with these experiences? Watching your loved one die painfully, polluting the oceans and stripping them of sea life by over-fishing, and killing a cow to make that taco? I don't know. The only hangup I have is with loved ones. The other two, no, your taco was not worth someone's life, your fishing experience did not need to inflict pain...maybe you and your loved one lived a blissful life together so you dealing with the PTSD of watching them die might break even, maybe they still would consent to being born even if they knew their death would be horrific.

Still though I think humans are essentially a virus on our planet. We've destroyed so much, have inflicted centuries of pain, for what? I do not believe the payoff is worth the cost."
Nootropics,fi1wuo9,t1_fi1op25,1582066430.0,"Lol I had a total break from reality with a prescribed ketamine lozenge. A very scary trip to say the least.

Its not side effect free lol.

That being said the IV ketamine does seem more effective as an antidepressant. I can‚Äôt speak for it fully though, only had 3 infusions, 1 lozenge experience. 

Will be doing more of both as well intranasal but idk if it has helped as much as I would have hoped for $350 per session lol."

antinatalism,fi1tzbp,t1_fi1srgd,1582064743.0,"What makes you think that things are 50/50 good v bad?

I like a quote that I read not too long ago that was something along the lines of, ""there's no such thing as chronic pleasure, however there is chronic pain"" and that sums it up for me in terms of there being more negative than positive in the world.

And if you think we are just programmed to remember the bad, what would you say outweighs a child being trafficked for x amount of years and tortured and then killed? Yes we evolved to pay attention to threats and psychologically we do remember the bad more than the positive, but is that still an argument in favor of existence, or even that things are 50/50? If we can't even reliably remember the good and we live in the past of things that are bad (such as the case with PTSD), would that not be an argument in favor of the world being a net negative since our thoughts are a part of our life's quality?"

This is just one awful scenario...there's endless scenarios where I can't think of something that can make that pain and suffering worthwhile."
antinatalism,fi1gfqx,t1_fhymjvo,1582057254.0,"Hobbies!

Gardening is really fun and can be rewarding, learning about different plants, sprouting them from seeds, they are aesthetically pleasing, fulfilling to take care of.

Yoga: depending on the studio, it can be amazing! Hot yoga especially. Relaxing, great workout, positive and soothing energy (which in my experience is needed in tandem with antinatalist beliefs). You can also just follow youtube videos.

Crochet: or knitting. I prefer the former. Haven't in awhile because of a hand surgery but you can make some crazy cool stuff. Clothing, house decor, figurines, just go on pinterest or youtube for inspo. There's so many beginning tutorials - it is an addicting hobby and really satisfying when you get a dope end product following free patterns online. Takes very little energy but can be mentally engaging.

Hula hooping: little more unique, but like crocheting, it takes time and practice to learn (not just on waist, there are tons of tricks you can learn), it really brings you into the present moment and you get lost in the ""flow"".

And just learning anything else. Maybe its a new language. An instrument. Coding. History. Etc.

All of these can be dirt cheap hobbies that don't require a lot of effort at the end of the day when you are burn't out from work, and honestly they are really rejuvenating!"

Our legacy is full of centuries of overwhelming pain.

Our world relies on surviving in a predatory food chain.

I don‚Äôt like the presumption that the mere length of our existence suggests it is honorable and worthwhile.

So I guess you should feel like shit next time you buy a sweater produced in a sweatshop because you‚Äôre failing our ancestors who pillaged, raped, murdered, and enslaved people all throughout history...

Yes we should feel guilty as consumers bc our actions impact the world and the people in it in many negative ways. But it‚Äôs a bit difficult to live off grid in our society and avoid indirectly inflicting harm on others. 

Our world is structured so that it is nearly impossible to live up to the legacy this quote suggests we should.

I wonder if I am maybe just too chemically depressed to even trip though as well. I somethings think that‚Äôs why pot has been soooo awful, it feels impossible to be positive with weed like a negative chemical reaction if that makes sense. And I am generally depressed when sober too. I was depressed back when I used to trip tho and had bad and good trips, the good trips were great, but just nervous this time around could be scaring if it is so bad.

I had a ketamine lozenge experience about a month ago and oh my god it was a nightmare. I lost complete touch with reality (which k supposedly does) but felt like I was everything I hate in life and I am horrible for everyone I know I just can‚Äôt see it bc I am delusional. It was frightening to say the least. It was prescribed K, I strongly advise against the lozenges, IV was helpful, just mad expensive.

I‚Äôd be scared a psychedelic devil would come out and tell me worse things that I heard on K, but psychedelics are also well known to help with depression. So I‚Äôm at a standstill, just don‚Äôt know what I want to do. I will try microdosing for sure, but undecided on a full trip."

Much of my depression is related to the idea of global world suffering and generally feeling powerless to do anything to help and feeling insane on top of it. 

So I agree bad trips can bring up stuff to work thru but damn how much is there?!

I begin to wonder if I am indeed insane since the rest of society would believe I am - the majority of people reproduce. They get on with life. 

Is my version of reality way off from the rest of the world? 

Are the worst forms of suffering I can imagine really not that bad, and is there some form of pleasure/happiness that can outweigh the worst sufferings in the world and make life worth living? Is my fear of going thru the worst atrocities overblown? 

Can I not feel genuine happiness, do I feel less than others? 

Am I a defect in a system that works for everyone else just fine? If yes, should I off myself bc I don‚Äôt belong or work right? Antinatalism is incredibly upsetting to most people since most people reproduce, so is my existence deteriorating others quality of life?

And I agree. Idk how tf anyone can look around our world and claim we are being watched by a ‚Äúloving‚Äù god. If we are in some sort of simulation, ye it‚Äôs the devil behind the controls.

Just read on wiki that a few different groups believe procreation sentences the soul to imprisonment and calling existence into matter imprisons the divine element of the universe. I see this POV.

It does feel a bit torturous thinking the world/existence will never end. Especially if any form of reincarnation exists. 

I once had a thought that the universe is conscious without anything in it, it just is, and being alone and conscious prompted the development of life as a way to gain some entertainment and distraction from total isolation and emptiness. I personally feel that we all share the same consciousness but live separately from one another mentally to pretend like we aren‚Äôt alone in the universe.
