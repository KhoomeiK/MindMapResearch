I think that the compromise comes down to me having occasional sex when I‚Äôd be happier without it (which is okay for me because I love my partner), and him accepting to have sex maybe half of the time that he‚Äôd like. 

I‚Äôm very fortunate that he doesn‚Äôt have that high of a sex drive to begin with ‚Äî I‚Äôm not sure we‚Äôd be able to make it work if he wanted sex weekly. 

For us, we spend a lot of time showing affection in ways that don‚Äôt have to do with having sex.

It was more so being upfront about not having a sex drive and not enjoying things that most women would find pleasurable (like oral, in my case). Reassuring him that i am attracted to him and that I find him very handsome, loving, etc. 

It may have taken longer for him to ‚Äúget it‚Äù than if I‚Äôd been up front and said ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm asexual,‚Äù but I felt that explaining to him what I can do and what I like was a lot easier at the beginning of the relationship than spending my time dispelling myths.

This is the first time I‚Äôve been able to compromise. I felt a lot of pressure in past relationships, and while I can put up with sex every so often, once a week or more has always been too much for me. Eventually, those relationships failed.

Teachers,err6dnf,t3_c3elx8,1561161553.0,"I can‚Äôt imagine how devastating this is, particularly since other teachers got notes/gifts. 

Try to remember, though, that it doesn‚Äôt mean you weren‚Äôt liked, that students aren‚Äôt grateful for their time with you, etc. 

When I was a student, it never occurred to me to write notes to my teachers or give them gifts, and I know it didn‚Äôt occur to my friends, either. There are more than a handful of teachers I had, though, that meant so much to me both at the time and later on, even though I didn‚Äôt say anything to them at the time. 

I know for a fact that you had some students who felt this way about you this year. You might hear it later on, or maybe not. Either way, know that you did the best you could this year, and that it was appreciated, even if not demonstrated by gifts."

But even the language used by the facilitators was so othering. Discussions about folks with bipolar actually just being narcissistic. Being told I could cure my bipolar disorder if I ate better.  Not to mention the whole ‚ÄúSchizophrenic people are violent. Be careful.‚Äù

And this is in heath care. With clinicians with an interest in mental health.

alberta,eqy7bje,t1_eqxyrhj,1560378571.0,"The thing is that written history can be fabricated/unreliable too. In the best instance, it‚Äôs representative of the experiences of a very select few ‚Äî those who could read and write at the time, and those important enough to be able to store and preserve their records. In this case, we are talking about upper-class, white male testimony. 

I‚Äôm not insinuating in any way that these historical actors were lying, but their views were definitely biased, and that needs to be taken into account, as well. The chances that their records reflected the events in an objective way that took the views of all parties into account is zero, if not very close to it. 

I do agree that oral history must be carefully examined. But scrutinizing oral history without scrutinizing the validity of written sources makes for invalid arguments. 

I didn‚Äôt read the 200-some-page report, so I don‚Äôt know if the reliability of these records was considered either in the report or through other academic research. Just here to comment about being critical on all sides of the case, and not just some :)

education,eqx0or4,t3_bzt102,1560363776.0,"Not at a Bachelor‚Äôs level, but I have a BA, MA and PhD in History. It was my greatest passion, but it‚Äôs not like historians are in any sort of demand. 

Based on my research experience, I landed a position in coordinating clinical research. While I didn‚Äôt gain any field-specific knowledge during my formal education, my transferable skills and on-the-job training have been more than adequate. 

My opinion is that you shouldn‚Äôt go back to school if you don‚Äôt have to. The nice thing about Bachelor‚Äôs degrees is, unless you‚Äôre in a specific professional field (engineering, nursing, teaching, etc.), a Bachelor‚Äôs is flexible. You‚Äôve demonstrated commitment, an ability to think critically, and the ability to learn and adapt to new material. Those skills are actually what employers want to see when they require an undergraduate degree. 

For many people, it‚Äôs often better to take a few courses and do some networking than to ‚Äúhide‚Äù in a classroom for any number of years. 

Do what you‚Äôre passionate about doing, of course. I took my education all the way to the end because I was passionate about it. I don‚Äôt regret it because I loved it. But I also have to admit that doing so has harmed my career more than it has helped."

rescuecats,epup2w5,t3_bw1a0f,1559513273.0,"It takes different cats different amounts of time to settle in. While my first rescue made herself at home fairly quickly, was using the litter regularly, and started eating after two or three days, my second rescue was quite different. She maybe ate 1 oz of wet food in the first week, peed once, and that was it. She also had diarrhea for a few weeks after that initial week or so. 

Keep supplying her with fresh food and water and keep checking her litter. When you have time, just sit near her and read a book/go on your phone. It will help her get used to you being around without you forcing your attention on her. 

Please do contact the rescue for information and see if you can‚Äôt have their vet records forwarded to your vet. Regardless, have your new baby see your vet soon for a check up. I think it‚Äôs important that, regardless of what a rescue says, you have a baseline on your rescue‚Äôs health and know any steps you need to take to get them healthy. Since your girl was just spayed and has apparently been malnourished, I think this is particularly important. 

Be patient but keep an eye on her! Congratulations on your rescue!"
