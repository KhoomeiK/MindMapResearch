Dreams,fnytx74,t1_fnym6by,1587375518.0,Sometimes I believe that dreams can be signs although I don't really believe in such things. When I didn't talk to my friend for 4 days I got a very good dream where she was with me and I got courage to say sorry for not texting her when she needed it. It really hurt me when she told me that. I was crying for a long time but the day before her birthday I got a dream where we were just texting each other. That day we met by chance in bus. We talked and it was such a relief that she is fine but I still miss her a lot. Now I once for around three days have a dream where we just walk together or text each other. It makes me feel better. Now I love dreaming but today it just made me feel kinda... wrong (?). I just can't describe it on english.
Dreams,fnyjm3b,t1_fnyg4j8,1587365127.0,Thanks for your advice. When I was little I had nightmares every night and when I was awake I could see monsters in the room. Then when I was 7 all nightmares just disappeared and only few years ago I started having dreams. I'm sorry to hear that you were struggling from nightmares for a long time but I hope that you will be able to see more good dreams (sorry if I misunderstood you).
