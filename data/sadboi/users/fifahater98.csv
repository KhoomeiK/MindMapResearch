So many times i get a penalty that is the goalkeeper doing the foul and it should be a red card but its only a yellow. But to be fair thats the only thing that im pointing in this game, im having twice the fun and no rage at all"

I really love her and i dont see myself with another girl but at the same time the distance and stress from both being so far apart and the stress from work isnt helping mentally. I got really shitty days where i just feel like im angry with everything and just feels like im going to breakdown, but at the same time when im with her its like thats just goes away. I think you should try to hold on and things might work out. Im really hoping it does work, good luck"
