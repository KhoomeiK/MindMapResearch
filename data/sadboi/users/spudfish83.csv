If you're really budgeting, I suggest eating on the go - sandwiches, fruit etc from the supermarkets in the city centre.  Nearest one to you would be a 5ish minute walk to the South Bridge where there are several.
The weather is usually nice, so picnicking in the Meadows or Princes Gardens is great for lunch. 
There's a nice pizza place next to the surgeons hall that's good value for real Italian pizza, I'll have a think about other places to sit & eat if you like?

The Half Price Hut can be a great saving for event tickets, or you could check out the Free Fringe, lots of great venues along the Cowgate and into the Grassmarket for that. Get there early and the queues are fairly short normally.

Drinking can be horrendously expensive at the festival, so if you do want to have a few, beware the temporary venues for sure.

Whistlebinkies and The Globe tend to be better value, they're pubs year round and see the free shows as a bonus to the bar takings rather than a scalping opportunity.
Bannerman's is my favourite tho, on the Cowgate near lots of venue's: good, cheeper beer and excellent music. 👍

It's how most of the rest of us start out. I moved from Liverpool to a tiny village on the North East coast. Only knew a few family members ten miles away. Only really knew work people for the first 18 months.

Then I went into a local pub. I risked being a blert. They were friendly, and six years on I'm part of the village. I walk down the high street and I'll know two thirds of the people I meet (pre lockdown, obv!).

I even have my own pub nickname.

Risk it. You will be out of practice, but so what? There are relatively few arseholes actively trying to tear you down, even in Liverpool!
Just say you haven't been out much because you don't know the area. Ask a few questions - where's a good barber, what's that new shop going to be down the road?
Listen to the reply, and reply back relevantly as possible, ending with another question or a joke, so the other person has something to react to.

Whereabouts are you in Liverpool? Maybe I'll know a good pub near you?

Lots of people go into a pub on their own, just to see who turns up. If possible, I suggest sitting at the bar. You can then have short interactions with people that may become conversations or just talking practice ""sorry mate, I'll move over"" ""is that a decent beer? I've not been in here before"". 

The barman is partly paid to talk to the punters too, and he's working, not with people socially, so that might be a good person to start with.
