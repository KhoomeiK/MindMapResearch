So my advice is to give them something that really seperates them for everything else. In a dark world, make the characters lighthearted. In a bright and fluffy world make them the creepy edgy character that doesn't fit in.

Just try to take it slowly and remind yourself that you got this. A breakdown here and there don't make your acomplishments any less amazing and impressive. You've already survived every bad day and shitty moment you've had so far. You got this."
Anxiety,fftgv74,t1_fftfsn7,1580220176.0,"Well definitely don't use them instead of your antidepressants. Addictive and they also don't do anything to really allow you to live your life. They don't just calm you down anxiety wise, they calm everything in you, any energy and motivation just melts away. They are knock out pills.
Which is great for short term or sporadic use during tough times in your life, but should not be used for extended periods. 

Honestly i was always concerned about the doctor who prescribed me benzos. Yes they were helpful but it was a little.... sketchy now that i think back.

I don't know how to help you with the side effects, maybe you can rewire your brain and not need antidepressants anymore, maybe you can't. I can't tell the future and im not a therapist or nueroscientist. But if you really are struggling in the short term and wanna bring up benzos again,  mabye make a deal with her and get a small amount of pills and you have to log when you take them in a journal or something so she can check it and make sure you aren't having too many. 
Discuss with your therapist as well to try and find better techniques and therapies to help you if nothing is working well right now."

Anxiety,fftfh5s,t3_ev5oer,1580219037.0,"I was given them and told to take one a day and an extra as needed. I have addiction in the family so i deceided to take as needed only with some rules; never two days in a row and no more than 3 days a week having taken them. 
I just used them when i felt i couldn't calm down from anything else for an extended period of time. I only had 3 in a week about 3 different times, i had that prescription for months.

They do help though. I sometimes would only take half of one because a whole pill would relax me so much that i was not as productive because i just wanted to curl up and chill.
Talk to your doctor about it. The pills have their purpose. And if you stick to some rules like i suggested, you will probably keep addiction at bay. 
That being said, addiction works differently in everyone. That's why some people get addicted to some things while others don't."

AskReddit,ffbzibv,t3_estazw,1579787613.0,"In defense of another. This includes premeditated murder. 
For instance if i knew someone was molesting their child but the usual legal course of action did not or would not work to keep that person from the child. In that instance i would justify to myself that poisoning someone or trapping them and starving them in a basement or something. 
Murder is not a real punishment. They die and do not suffer anymore. It is a way to stop the person from hurting others. 
I don't think i would kill someone unless they are a danger in some way. 

To be perfectly clear, i have no plans to hurt anyone. But i can see myself able to justify certain actions in my own morals."
