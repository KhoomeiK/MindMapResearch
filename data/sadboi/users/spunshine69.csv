CamGirlProblems,fika0er,t1_fijk3qx,1582476177.0,"That sounds too easy! I feel like that could be an exciting progression tho, start by doing the minimum and work my way up! I'm looking to start in the summer time. I feel like I should do my due diligence and create a character and a space and gain as much knowledge as I can before diving in. I've spent the last 3 days researching equipment etc and I think I can pull it off. Thanks so much for all your tips"

I see youngins that look like you and think ""My God I wish I was that confident"" to pull of an unusual hairstyle, or bold lip color. I think what you should focus on here is that each person is going to ""rate you"" based on their unique preferences and that not everyone likes the same things. I feel that the folks here are a bit more concerned with what society deems as beautiful when in fact there are thousands of characteristics that make us good looking to others. And I dont mean ""you're beautiful on the inside"" or ""you're pretty because you've got a nice personality"" You're really outwardly lovely so fuck a number, amirite?"
