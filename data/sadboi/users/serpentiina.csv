Filing when you're going light to dark is necessary, filling is putting that pigment back in when you stripped it out by lightening. If you slap a brown color over top it's going to fade green. You said you were a light brown/blonde during the summer. That's a level 7, which is considered a dark blonde. I wouldn't recommend going any darker than that. Fill with a 8C (blonde copper) with 10 volume, then go over top with a 7A (level seven ash) with volume 10 developer; the ash is going to counteract the copper."

I missed myself and I missed being happy without having to smoke. It's just a bandaid. I'm 19 days clean and i finally am starting to feel like myself and it's definitely a very hard journey but occupy yourself as much as you can.

So it's kinda impractical, I mainly use it at night when I have down time and I don't have to do anything but keep in mind that if you do touch anything you will leave a greasy trail everywhere you go.

It's a really good thing that you weeded him out, because that just makes room for a person who deserves you and loves you just the way you are. I'm so sorry he left, but like I said it just makes room for another person to come in that will actually understand and cherish you. The right person will come, I did not seek out my current bf he came to me and I think that goes with any relationship you need to let that person come to you because once you start looking your standards will be lower and you'll start accepting things that they do that aren't in your best interest."
BPD,f77rg1k,t3_dulkz9,1573472468.0,"I've been with my boyfriend for 2 years, not going to lie he has his own issues too, and I've just now started therapy. He's very supportive and understanding, however he wasn't like that straight away I did get a couple scoldings in the beginning because I acted out irrationally at work (we used to work together, bad idea btw) and he didn't know about my past because its obviously hard to open up to someone you love with the shit that made who you who are. He now knows, sometimes he has to treat me like a child, validate me, tell me things are okay etc. And I know it's hard for him sometimes because he's just as busy as I am but he still does it. 

When someone loves you, they are willing to grow with you, learn and listen to you. They are going to be there for you when you need them most, they are going to be willing to listen to your concerns and understand that sometimes you can be really irrational but they know that is not a direct reflection of you. My biggest issue is still communication because I either let him make all the decisions, keep silent when I don't agree with them, or I act out like a child and throw a temper tantrum at him over the littlest things because I've come up with a whole conspiracy in my head that he hates me or is trying to hurt me. I'm learning to communicate my needs to him, which my therapist is helping me with, it's really hard and the transition is hard for my bf too because like I said he would do things that he thought I was fine with but I'm actually not, I just went along with it because he's my FP and I'm always scared that if I speak up he won't love me anymore. My bf now knows how to calm me down and he recognizes the symptoms and is a lot more patient and lenient with me. Like I said, shit isn't easy but who said love in general is easy? If your SO truly loves you and wants to see you thrive, they will be willing to change and grow with you."

And I find that using that to get rid of the line works perfectly. Also when you're trying to get rid of that line and get a seamless fade, go at the line with the corner of your clippers the opposite direction of the hair growth.

And there wasn't much I could do because he didn't get cut by clippers or anything it was a tapered sissor cut all around so it was sooo noticable. I texturized the shit out of that one spot and he was older so he didn't pay any attention to it. I felt soo fucking bad that I didn't even say anything to him. He never came back or complained. I felt so horrible because he gave me a 10 dollar tip that day too and I was like in my head ""oh God no why do you have to tip me so well"" üò≠ I was and still am so guilty about that.

After soaking let your hands air dry then put on eczema cream of your choosing (I like Aveeno or Nivea) after that put a thick layer of healing ointment/Vaseline or Neosporin. I've found healing ointment and Neosporin work the best. Put on some gloves and then another pair of gloves on top of that and sleep with that on for a couple of nights, until it heals. During the day you need to wear bandages over the cracked skin so it doesn't get infected or irritated and keep it mosturized with Neosporin."

Hair appearing out of nowhere, smelling something rotting and a non humanoid dark shadow/shape is a bad sign. I'm not saying that you're dealing with a demon but you are definitely dealing with something that is a dark entity. You need to stop dismissing it's signs, spirits feed off your energy especially bad energy and when you're trying to act like they aren't there it just fuels them even more. You need to tell your family that whenever they have an experience they need to firmly tell whatever is there that they do not have permission to be in this house. Even if you just feel a sense of dread or like someone is watching you, firmly say that this is your house and that they do not have permission to be here. Also I would really recommend cleansing your house with white sage, corner to corner of every room. And I don't know if you're religious or not but if you are it wouldn't hurt to pray whenever you feel like someone is there with you, even if you aren't religious you can still pray to a white light and ask it to protect you and your family.

And I know my sister probably got sexually assaulted too but idk if she told my mom or anyone about that. I put almost all of my blame on my father. But I remember when my mom beat me a couple times and also smacked me in the mouth with her ring. I've brought it up to her in conversations where we talk about the past, and she downplays the beatings and the smack. It makes me angry that she didn't leave him sooner, but then again I understand why.. my dad was a scary dude and he had control over everything (what we wore, ate, where we went, everything) she wasn't allowed to have a job, wear anything but men's clothes to look undesirable.. so she didn't have any sort of freedom or income. I remember when we finally left, my mom saved up 300 dollars and we packed everything in the car and left. That was when I was 9. Is it wrong that I feel resentment towards my mom? She has gone through so much in her life and I understand that but I wish she would have told someone about my dad raping me and I wish she didn't beat me like she did in the past. After we left him she began dating men and I got mad at her because she would have them over and I was severely uncomfortable around any kind of man back then, I remember being so angry at her just for dating. I was young and I didn't tell her how I felt about her boyfriends so she didn't know but I have a feeling she got the idea that I didn't like it because she hasn't dated anyone in the past 3 years."
BPD,etyvaxf,t3_cdwl7u,1563323197.0,"I don't like physical touch from anyone in my family bc of trauma so I just cling onto my boyfriend every chance I get and he's super affectionate too so I lucked out. sometimes I play hit him like a toddler almost and do things like lay on his stomach, straddle his legs, lay directly on top of him. And he's told me I sit criss cross alot, and when he sits down on his porch I sit in between his legs. I've gotten better with boundaries when we're out, like to not act like a child. But yeah I get really clingy especially after being intimate with him and if I don't get held directly after I feel like he's going to leave me."
BPD,et4v0v6,t3_c9so9x,1562458082.0,"That's exactly how it is with my boyfriend he's my FP and he really understands me and is very intuitive in the sense that he knows when I'm going through things and when I'm just hurt and is always there no matter what. He knows about my condition and instead of focusing on the bad, he focuses on the good. This happened just yesterday he was like ""if you had to describe me in one word what would it be?"" I thought for a minute and said eccentric and then I asked what his one word for me was. He had trouble and I asked him why and he answered ""i cannot think of one word, but I can think of 4 words"" I ask what it was and he said ""ahead of your time"" I know it's not much but that just really made me feel good about myself and it just shows how well he perceives me despite the negative traits I have sometimes"
