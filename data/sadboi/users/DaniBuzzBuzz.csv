steak,fmfg89u,t3_fuytxt,1586026586.0,"Left the pan on the heat for a bit, added butter and waited for it to brown slightly.

Steaks were seasoned with loads of cracked pepper and sea salt. Put them in the pan and left them for about 3 minutes. Flipped them when they were dark brown. Added 4 gloves of garlic that were crushed open. Left for another 3 mins.

Seared the fat and sides until they had colour and chucked into the oven for 3 mins.

At the same time was boiling potatoes - added cream and butter, salt, pepper and mashed.

Took the steaks out of the pan and rested them on a chopping board. Chucked 3 chopped mushrooms into the pan. Added some evaporate milk, and a table spoon of gravy granules. Simmered for 2 minutes.

Chopped up the steak, and poured any juices on the board back into the gravy.

Voila!"

I'm playing but yh....bot very nice of her"
AmItheAsshole,flncfzp,t1_flnbk4i,1585315398.0,"Were your flights cancelled too, apart from having to be in quarantine when u got back?

That's the thing, if my flights were still valid, the holiday wouldnt have been great anyway! Things may not have been running (if the lockdown in Philippines was to lift, it may take a while for them to get back to normal) so I think it's good that u may have to rebook. See Japan when it's in full swing not panic mode.

Although there is the guilt of travel: what if I spread the virus? What if I brought it to Philippines or back to england! What if I infect people along the way? The guilt would be too much

I really hope you can rebook in the future and have the amazing holiday you planned and deserved!xx"
AmItheAsshole,flmq7k1,t1_flmixax,1585292173.0,"Thank you for your answer!
So sorry for your trip too, where were u going to go?"
AmItheAsshole,flllg8y,t1_flli1z7,1585262743.0,He is out of work right now hence the touchy subject. What would you do then?
AmItheAsshole,fllcztm,t1_fllcqg6,1585257988.0,"No no hes not trying to NOT pay. I just feel bad for saying ""can you still keep up with the payments even though its cancelled and youre out of a job, just while I sort everything out because I'm down nearly Â£1000""

It's a rough time!"
AmItheAsshole,fllbd4c,t1_fllatkh,1585257098.0,"Hmm that's true about if the flight is cheaper. Didn't think about THAT. 

Since I booked through a travel agent the only option I have is to get credit right now. Then i can opt for a refund with Emirates. But thanks, I'll take that advice!

And I definitely do want to go Philippines, I have family there!"
AmItheAsshole,fllaxsj,t1_fllakpo,1585256869.0,And what happened girl?! That's it? He left without ever paying?
AmItheAsshole,fllahic,t1_fll9k9k,1585256623.0,Only scorned due to good reason I'm sure!
AmItheAsshole,fll97hm,t1_fll8qy8,1585255942.0,Nicely put!
AmItheAsshole,fll95ht,t1_fll8r9p,1585255914.0,"Yes you are right. Refund would be if we wanted to book eith another airline or for a different region of travel with Emirates.

Since we still want to fly with them and still wat to fly to Philippines, credit is the best option.

I'm guessing these terms are specific for the current situation around the world 

Thanks for your answer!"
AmItheAsshole,fll8vht,t1_fll8p2j,1585255769.0,True. Hes actually better off than me his income is just more sporadic than mine hence the need to pay in chunks. I'm on a fixed income every month
AmItheAsshole,fll8ovz,t1_fll8gr1,1585255673.0,"I really hope so. I feel so sorry for hotels n airlines having to deal with this. The number of emails/calls must be huge.

Thanks I was feeling a bit poopy for asking since hes not working now, self employed plumber for construction sites *sigh*"

The time I was eating carbonara was at my desk so again that didnt help... although I do think she's lying about hating the smell of carbonara cuz shes never opened the window before
relationships,ffixaqi,t1_ffivc0o,1579984981.0,"Agreed. I feel it is on the card. We've talked about it loads of times.... but I just dont know WHEN it will happen. I know 5 years is a lot but there isn't a timer on when people should get engaged. It's quite toxic to think like that. Everyone would be on a timer from day one in that case!

Yes I'm frustrated but I'm brong patient... I'm not forcing anyone to marry me! Lol no shotgun weddings here!"
relationships,ffiux7r,t1_ffiofrc,1579983336.0,"This is my fear. ""Swing by after work"" is not what I envision for either of us. He should be fully present in the pregnancy and in the birth and after. I feel he should see the bump grow everyday!

I see his brother's girlfriend visit on the the weekends, and have to leave because he has his other kids are staying over. Even if they aren't, ultimately the weekends is all they have. And maybe a couple hours after work.

I drill into my boyfriends head this is NOT what I want and he respects that.... I just dont know if he will propose anytime soon hence my stress. What if we struggle to conceive? I know I want lids with him.... as his fiance or wife."
relationships,ffiqsp5,t1_ffink1t,1579980395.0,"And this is what I want. Both me and my boyfriend had poor examples of what dads should me (his was like how his brother is now: multiple baby mums, never married) and my Dad was present but so cold and also had another family and cheated on my mum.

AmItheAsshole,ff2xjbo,t1_feuga5r,1579527790.0,"I do feel that bring flaky and not following through with promises a bit of a bad character trait... so yes I fo expect him to change.

We had a long talk yesterday and for the umpteenth time I've told him when you forget our plans and leave me to scramble to fix everything it gives off the impression that you just don't care. He apologised again but I have just told him I'm not going to plan things around him. I will just do things myself and if he wants to help he can, but I am no longer going actively ask him to do things for me - it just leads to me doing it anyway!"

Tomorrow I'm also going to a pawnbroker to see how much I can get for it, i know it would be full rrp but i only need 60% for the card holder

Such a faff for something that didn't need to be difficult!"

And yes it is material things and my relationship should be more important.... but mate what's more important than communication! I've told him explicitly what to get, sent it to him, expressed i didnt want the wallet and he STILL goes ahead and buys it.
 I originally didnt want anything, but he set the amount when he decided he wanted a gold chain... so I went and asked for something I would never buy myself... now I REALLY got something I wouldnt buy myself loool"

depression,fc00099,t3_ef4960,1577271171.0,"I kno how you feel. I'm an only child too... mum is divorced, dad is nowhere to be found, and my family is all estranged (person A not talk to person B who doesn't want to see person C) so Christmas its just not the same.

I see everyone with their big families all gathering at someone's house for the holidays... I'm sitting in bed messaging on reddit. I feel like once I get my own place I'll host Christmas so I wont be lonely.

I have my boyfriends family which is pretty big but its not my own. I visit them on christmas and I feel like I'm putting on such a front to ""Be Happy"" when really I just want to be alone... so sad is that.

Hope you have a good Christmas tho, your Mum and Dad must feel so happy you're there."

I'm more so asking about the safety of buying without seeing, I have a 3 day grace period where I can reject the car but still its a big trust to just take a car with no viewing"
