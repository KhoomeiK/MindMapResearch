I bought new sheets, new towels, I learned a bunch of stuff about kinks and foreplay, I even bought a pair of way too comfortable to be kinky red leather cuffs. I planned this down to the last second, I had been talking to this girl for a month and she was into all sorts of things. The big night comes around and I'm doing all the work and she tells me I'm the best she's ever had, I mean it felt good but not good enough to nut, so I went all night long and had the worst back cramps the next day.

The first few days back were rough for me as I was really embarrassed, I was lucky to have caring and sympathetic co workers. Depending on where you work you might be able to seek counseling through your HR program for free I used that in the weeks following. What's important is that you recognize what at work caused it and slowly working your way back into rhythm. There's not much else I can say since everyone's experience is very different, I hope this helps in any way."
