Cool. 

Your job right now is to get your head on straight. You are in no headspace right now to even be flipping burgers. Nobody can do this for you. Yes, you can take the guidance from your therapists, but only you - nobody else - can do the hard work of self repair.

You need to get your shit together enough to lean into things that make you uncomfortable. You need to remind yourself that you have survived those experiences in the past and will continue to do so.

You're right in having time apart being healthy for a relationship. Healthy relationships are built on the foundations of trust, respect, and boundaries. Cohabitating partners ebb and flow in their presence with each other, and give each other space as they go along. If there's conflict, they talk it through and find resolutions.

This is my tried and true method:

Go pee before you begin, then come back and set up the towels. Get yourself good and aroused (at least 10-20 minutes of play here) and then either with your fingers or the toy inside you- try to push them out. Don't let either leave your vagina! Try to push out for a count of ten. 

Go back to masturbating for a few minutes. Now try pushing again. Same deal - nothing is allowed to leave. 

Do this routine at least three to 5 times if you can take it. On the last time, allow yourself to actually push your pussy empty and the vibe/fingers as you do so. I guarantee you'll gush on this go.

-Disinfect your hands and all touch points in your vehicle/wallet/keys. Keep hand sanitizer close and use it often.

-Keep bathroom breaks to a minimum. Hold it if you can. 

-If you do have to go, wear a proper fitting mask and wash your hands properly before and after doing your business.

I'm on the therapy train as well, and boy howdy there's a lot floating in there that I'm not ready to share yet. But baby steps are good. Just know that any trained psychologist has the toolkit to see past the walls we put up for ourselves. 

Your therapist - whether you know it or not - is doing their best to help you with the material they have to work with. They can see that wall, and they are patiently waiting until you're ready to go deeper. It's not their place to judge. Remember that."
