migraine,fixh7ob,t3_faeesd,1582820342.0,That's great. It can be so scary when our migraines change after being the same for so long. It can make us a little crazy with all the what ifs. So glad that you got good news!
migraine,fi785yy,t3_f6v8hn,1582216254.0,I have the same thing 10 years now. I have only seen my neurologist a couple times so far. But she says I have chronic severe migraines. She said the pain I call headaches are the same migraine just at a lower pain level. So I have had the same migraine for 10 years. She has started me on meds to see if we can get it to break. She says it will take trying different meds and combinations to see if we can stop it. No guarantee but the hope is to break the cycle and maybe be pain free at some point or at least keep the pain at a low level more often.
migraine,ffy4yxp,t3_evnhnf,1580338643.0,"I have chronic migraines so I am at at least a 5 pain scale everyday. I also have 2 children. My migraines started to increase when my children were small. Previous to that I got them once or twice a month. I am also a  single mother since they were very small.  It was hard to deal with my kids sometimes when my migraines were especially bad, it was never easy.  But I have found that you find a way to deal just like every other parent.  The strength that I have discovered in myself to be able to function is surprising. My children are now teens and they are very empathetic people. They do feel that my brain fog and inability to remember things sometimes was annoying but we used a white board and more recently text and alarms to remind me of things. We have found  ways to deal with the effects of migraines in ever improving ways."

AskReddit,fbrekfo,t3_ee3b1i,1577042113.0,I have 3 aneurysms and I am waiting for treatment . It has been very stressful for myself and my children.  My issue is that when my 18 yo son gets stressed he picks a fight then stops talking to me for weeks.  He picked a fight after my last rounds of test about a month a go  and hasent spoken to me since. Every day I could die and just want to spend time with him but he refuses to even look at me.  I am scared if I do die he will never get over it.  I have no idea how to make him speak to me. I am heart broken.

migraine,f5zafqi,t3_dptww5,1572571534.0,"I have been diagnosed with 3 aneurysms. I am currently waiting for an angiogram before discussing surgical options.
The good news for you is that even if it is a aneurysm, it is small. Most at that size are just monitored to make sure they don't grow.
But it is always best to see a specialist so they can make sure what is it and what is the best treatment for you. Having your family doctor involved will help you to see the right people to be able to diagnose and treat you properly. 
I know it is hard, but try not to worry too much, I know easier said than done.  All my best to you."
