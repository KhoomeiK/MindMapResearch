That was the last words he had said. I love you. He stared me right in the eyes and said three little words that didn't mean anything to anyone except him and me.

""I love you""

I still hear those three little words ringing in my ears. I ignore it. Push it down. I have things to do. Nothing can stop me now. The hero was dead and no obstacle stood in my way to conquering the twelve kingdoms.

""I love you""

I drown out the words with the death knells of my enemies. Even being on the front lines doesn't keep those words from swarming in my head. I'm almost done. I've almost attained true power. I can't let these three little words stop me now. I have to keep going.

""I love you""

They'll understand. They'll all understand once I've finished. This is for the best. *I* am for the best. They cower now, my presence looming ever greater as more armies fall. More kingdoms fall. I have attained more power than any three little words could ever have and everyone sees that. I force myself to see it, too.

""I love you""

I know what I'm doing. I know why I'm doing it. I'm justified. I'm right. I'm **right**. But those three little words have afflicted me with a curse far more powerful than any spell I've ever slung. Doubt.

""I love you""

Why? Why did he say it? I know why he said it, but *why* did he say it? Three little words. Three **little** words. Three. Little. Words.

""I love you""

I HAVE IT ALL! I'VE WON! THERE IS NOTHING THAT STANDS ABOVE ME! SHUT UP! SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP! Pleaseâ€¦ shut up.

""I love you""

I should have said it. I should have said it before I went through with all of this. I should have said it when it mattered. I should have said it when I had the chance.

""I love you too, Dad"""

This is the person in charge of the show, *and* the person in charge of ensuring consistency in the show's story (storyboard revisionist's job) saying that's their intent.

CassWasRight,fq9wpqt,t1_fq9nxde,1589208537.0,"Trauma and betrayal are NOT common life experiences from which strong romantic connections can form. Nor are they exclusive to Varian and Cassandra. Even if negative & traumatic experience were a basis for romantic relationships (which, once again, they're most certainly not), Cassandra and Rapunzel have *far* more in common in that regard, both having been traumatised by they're relationship with Gothel & being forced to hide who they are.

I really don't think they implied any future spin off would include or if open to a romance. Neither character interacted with each other before Cassandra left. She had an intimate goodbye with Eugene, and a truly loving goodbye with Rapunzel, and didn't even talk to Varian in the last episode.

And again, a 14 year old boy crushing on a 24 year old woman for one episode, and the woman showing no romantic interest in return, isn't the basis for a relationship."
CassWasRight,fq9tovg,t1_fq9odl1,1589206833.0,"First off, he explicitly said it's meant to destroy Cassandra. The writers put it in, it's not something ""rogue artists slipped in"", that's what is written in the script. That's not subtext, that's straight up text.

But more importantly, the logic that ""he was super excited to see Cassandra"" is an indication of romance can be applied to Rapunzel as well. Considering a lot of the writers were queer and have gone on record as saying they wanted to portray her in this way, I see far more validity in a romance between Rapunzel and Cassandra, two characters who have interacted significantly more often and intimately, than between a 14 year old's crush. They shared, what, 2 episodes worth of scenes together alone? She's spent significantly more one on one scenes with Eugene than that, much less Rapunzel.

Not meant to hurt your feelings, but can I ask your age and gender? Your vehement defense of this ship seems like it's come from someone who hasn't been in a serious, relationship or much experience interacting with the LGBTQ community."

CassWasRight,fq8wu5p,t1_fq8l3zq,1589177886.0,"The things you see as ""in common"" are mostly trauma and betrayal, which are not foundations for a romance. An alliance, perhaps, but not a romance.

If you think the age range was a hindrance to their on screen romance, then the writers likely didn't intend for an on screen romance. These were writers who planned from the beginning to make Cassandra a villain and Gothel's daughter; they planned a character arc for her that did not include a romance.

We could theoretically draw the conclusion she was acting in her natural romantic manner with Andrew despite her false emotions. The best acting comes from drawing on your own experiences, after all.
