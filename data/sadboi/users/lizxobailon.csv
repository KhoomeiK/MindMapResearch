The longest he fasted was 5 days and like on the refeed day he ate whatever and even drank alcohol but still made sure he maintained under his cals then they kept resuming w shorter fasts 24/48/72 and OMAD thru out the whole month n they still lost 20 pounds. To add on lol a lot of ppl recommend a keto based refeed..but what if we just track our calories on refeed days? I’m tryna test this out lmaoo cause I’m confused too w all this mixed advice
