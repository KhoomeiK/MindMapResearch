depression,fkpstb5,t3_f791jw,1584418382.0,"At this point, I think I'l always be prone to having depressive tendencies. Whenever my friends and I watch a sad movie st the cinema, they cry and shit but get over it real quick, and I'm left with a heavyness in my stomach and an awful fucking feeling of sadness that makes me want to go to bed for a week straight. I can't handle sad songs or films or books. I guess that's just the way I operate, but I don't think it's normal. I already recovered, though, so these episodes aren't that frequent. However, evert time I suffer from one, I wonder if I'll be easily triggered for the rest of my life"

I guess I'll be certain once I go to college and experiment with different people (guys and girls). Maybe you can do that too? In the meantime, try to take things easy and just roll with it. There's no point in pressuring yourself to get an answer about your sexuality when it is something that literally takes years to figure out."
