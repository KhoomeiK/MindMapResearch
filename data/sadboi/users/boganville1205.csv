Anxiety,flh5f6r,t3_fo6h6w,1585156423.0,"I’m a hypochondriac by nature but all this stuff has really pushed me over the line & I feel like no one around me understands how freaked out I am. I have a tightness in my chest, the logical side of me knows it’s anxiety, but the irrational side of me is convincing me I’m going to die. It doesn’t help that I am an essential worker as well and I have asthma, which puts me at high risk of complications if I do contract it. This post really helped me to know I’m not alone."
