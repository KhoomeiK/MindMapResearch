And don't judge yourself as being bipolar or whatever until you see a doctor you don't want to go down a path and then identify with it and later have to recalibrate your whole world.

If you distract yourself by doing all of the boring work on yourself and self care and blue light blocking and low lights at night, that's less time you are sitting around worrying, and you gain a little bit of feeling that you can change things, some power, some control, and that makes you want more.

Moods evolved, mania evolved, being jammed on, ignoring risks, dismissing others, everything it entails, can get things done. But being jammed on is what makes this a disorder.  Same way depression can help you let go of things, change things, its when it is stuck on for no reason long-term that it's a disorder.

So basically, you want to prevent episodes by keeping good rhythms, thats why sleep and routine is so important.

It's easy to overanalyze things. You have modules in your brain that evolved to solve certain problems our ancestors faced, sometimes they get triggered for no good reason and you're doing too much when you try to find the reason for everything. Sometimes it's better to just focus on the fundamentals of wellness and surf out the symptoms and not. If you make a checklist of the self-care things you can do every day and do them, that settles you down a lot.

First thing to check is, are you just addicted to mania and this is a temporary adjustment, you can rewire your brain to function better in euthymia. You can eat, hydrate, and sleep better. Then the lithium will work better.

There is again, something like a 1 in 10 chance that the lithium is just not for you on this side effect, and a 60% chance it wont work for you just on stats. But you gotta rule out every other factor, because it is a good drug

And it's my protective parts shutting down the idea because too much agitation will bring back the demons. 

Or it could be something totally different, but it's got something to do with that kind of thing, you just have to find out why you body is working that way what it is trying to do, and thank it for it's service and get it to play a new role. 

On the total flip side, you'll never be perfect, so you can focus on your values and how you wish things were if you had superpowers, and identify with that, thats the real you, not whatever happens in the crapshoot of life and biology, and reward yourself for being the kind of person that values doing things, not the outcome, and this helps me avoid feelings of loss, and keeps me focused on being happy I get anything done at all. 

You can mentally callous yourself and go david goggins all day, but if your reward system isn't working with you, there's no point.

Hey look they may have sold you wrong on this stuff. Bipolar meds keep you stable. Some like lamatrogine are better at depression. But if you don't want to be depressed, that's almost the easy part.

So that in a manic episode, the brain centers aren't connecting as well to regulate it. A diabetes of the mind, that's why lithium works, more connectivity. So it's actually just a vulnerability of the genes that everyone has, and we just have genes that are more vulnerable, they are still the genome. Human beings can all potentially be ""mood entrained"" under the right conditions.  No need for ""bipolar genes"" or evolutionary reasons why it exists, the vulnerability model explains everything much easier.  I hope that makes sense. Bless"

I didn't hurt anybody, I just acted crazy because my moods jammed on and my insight dips because that's how evolution shaped moods, if you didn't believe your moods and lose insight, moods wouldn't work and they wouldn't exist, being stupid while in a mood episode is by design.

You can just not care. You're not meant to suffer, you're not meant to anything. Your attachment to the outcome is what is driving you nuts, just like the buddhists say, it's literally true in your brain. If you weren't so smart, you wouldn't even think about this stuff. 

Think of it like I do, I get the same feelings, but they roll off me. And the metaphor I remind myself is perhaps silly, tinnitus. People who practice ACT and CBT can basically ""cure"" their tinnitus by training their brain to not be distressed by it, and not notice it. It was only annoying and life altering because of the value their consciousness placed on it. Now they can only notice it if they think about it, oh yeah like noticing the sun, always there. And you disconnect. 

And just focus on your values, long-term goals that you may not live up to every day or week but you refocus on them eventually no matter what, and you can feel good about just focusing on what you wish would happen, what you would want to happen if you had superpowers, that's the real you, that's what you should feel good about, that you're going towards that, and you dont let your disease or shitty people or the will of god to get in your way, and you just laugh at the human weakness when you fall.

Just off the top of my head, for me, could be wrong for you, just wear a sleepmask, and don't get out of bed until your alarm, and do mindfulness on your insane energy, eventually, you'll calm down.

I used to just go on the computer whenever I had energy to, I was an infoaddict, and I would get up, and stay up, whenever. Over time, I realized that was usually how episodes would start. I actually started doing dark therapy before I read that article, I learned over time, if you can't sleep, lay there in the dark the entire night anyway. Eventually, you go into a half sleep, the mania comes down, I usually listened to some really boring crap like bbc radio or a documentary about the boring parts of the Roman Empire. And it's just amazing how you can function compared to if you were up even looking at your phone. I did it 3 nights in a row and still went to work every day and crushed it, 3rd day I couldn't believe how sane I was. So, those therapies will show you the way, but you always have the option of just doing mindfulness in the pitch black. Ahhh i'm too jacked to lay here!

bipolar,fqe26ps,t3_gidahh,1589300540.0,"This is the way I personally think about  it

Depression evolved in humans to solve problems, get you to avoid risk, let go of things that aren't serving you, avoid people you wouldn't get along with, and hence is kind of rewarding in its own way, or else you would be more motivated to end it. The disorder comes in when it is stuck on and out of sync with the events of your life, or the thoughts in your mind, for long periods, and drives you insane, and towards the mental hospital. 

So you can do a dance with these evolved modules in your brain and instead of fight them, try to structure your life so they get signals that it's safe to go out and do things. There's nothing wrong with you per se, unless you decide you are not enjoying this and it is not serving you. So we invented cbt and ipsrt and push ups to get your brain the signal that hey, you know what, getting after it will serve me today!"

I hear it all the time on here with daughters fighting with their mothers who say that they don't have bipolar, but everyone knows they bipolar as well, and being really hurtful to their own daughters about their emotional problems. 

I'm no counselor, but the one piece of advice that comes to mind is about the one thing that I learned from this book (about the spectrum from too little, to healthy, too much narcissism)

https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/5-secrets-how-to-win-narcissist

""More than a dozen studies exploring whether or not narcissists can change have now been conducted… and they all point to the same conclusion: encouraging narcissists to feel more caring and compassionate reduces their narcissism… If narcissists are approached in a gentler way, many seem to soften emotionally. When they feel secure love, they become more loving and more committed in return… The lesson from research is that people only slide down the spectrum when they’re reminded of the importance of their relationships. Change doesn’t come from telling them off for being too success-driven, ruthless, or manipulative; it comes by showing them the benefits of collaboration and understanding.""

It helps you in the short term, you focus on what it is doing to you in the moment, and you conceptualize your use around this experience, but like a frog being boiled, you don't see all of the ways it is destabilizing you. Cannabinoid receptors are found literally everywhere in the brain, they affect hundreds of different processes. Even in a person with no psychiatric diagnoses, it affects 300 something processes, most of them are good for them, but many are bad, and net they have a good time and function. Bipolar people have a need for rhythms and stability, and it is massively destabilizing, but you really have to sit back and be honest with yourself over a long period of time. 

And how many smokers actually have quit for 6 months and done the comparison. People quit for 3 weeks and say wow I felt a lot better high and I'm feeling way worse! Cannabis withdrawal syndrome can last for weeks! I didn't get better for a least a month, and week 2 and 3 the withdrawal triggered an episode. So how would you know? Unless you fully ran the A/B test, what is really better for you?

Some people undoubtedly technically are better on good pot with cbd because of whatever is going on in their brain, sure. But you have to include the opportunity cost. You stopped smoking but what habits did you replace it with? Your brain needs input for serious neuroplasticity, your brain has been running on fake cannabinoids for years, you dont just detox for a few days and this is your brain not on pot. Rant over

bipolar,fqc99tt,t3_ghzsxj,1589252833.0,"I can tell you how I explain it to myself using the best scientific theories available. Mania is what we call high mood that is jammed on all the way for a long time, that's the disorder part. High mood was shaped by evolution just like depression was shaped by the challenges our ancestors faced. It triggers modules that encourage you to be dominant, ignore risk, dismiss others, believe you are amazing, attractive, omnipotent (rich) and not fear pain, and dismiss pain in others as weak. In stressful times, it could come in handy. If you could just have insight to this and shut it off, it wouldn't really work as an evolved tool.

The original theory that started evolutionary psychology was about self-deception. Trivers said people were self-deceived because believing your own lies is the best way to convince others that you truly believe it, and this resulted from an evolutionary arms race in our social species. 

Depression gets you to let go of things, avoid risk, overvalue your loved ones to the point of separating yourself from them to support your dna in them in best way you can. Our vulnerability is that this stickiness of moods, that is a feature and not a bug, gets disordered due to a lack of connectivity between certain parts of our brains compared to others. Imagine a horse's leg, it has to be light, but strong, so evolution brings it up to a point, where a certain percentage, usually 1% of horses will have brittle legs, that's the cost of the mechanism, certain people by chance will have a vulnerability in the system. This is all from the work of Randolph Nesse, and the textbook of evolutionary psychiatry. I didn't make it up :)

So, are you there? Sure you're experiencing it. But you have no insight at all, by design of the system, you're going with the first thought that comes into your head, by design. I'm ashamed to say that although I was single at the time, I fell into an almost identical kind of pattern as him. Never happened when I not triggering mania with alcohol. 

So that's it in a nutshell. If more people knew these theories, less people would kill themselves. It's how I make it through the day when memories of the last 20 years get triggered. 

I hope you both find a way to find happiness and health through a science-based understanding of yourselves and this disorder"

Even if it's true that they discharged you early or whatever, no science or medicine is perfect. Legendary surgeons sometimes accidentally kill people, drug interactions get missed. It's not a perfect world. It's absolutely no reason to stop using science-based medicine. Trust is a strong word. Bet on the best horse in the race every time. And the best horse is a modern psychiatric setting. Advocate for yourself all day. But don't let yourself fall into emotional reasoning that they must be bad because you had a bad experience.

Conspiracy theories about big pharma is not a relevant thing in serious psychiatric settings. These drugs are all extremely serious and well-studied. If that's your worry, why would you want a new drug, the old drugs have the longest and most trustworthy safety records. Newer doesn't mean better. The best drug by every measure is lithium! It's been used for 70 years!

You should trust your doctor about what medication is right for you, and discuss whether something new will be better.

Bipolar is like a vulnerability to getting jammed on. And the disturbing part about it is that you have no control, and your usual methods of self care, calming, and distracting yourself, or working hard at something, then don't affect the entrainment. And all of your emotions are so heightened from being jammed on, every little bit of information, right or wrong, manic or depressed, feels so compelling, because the feature of mania (these states have roots in evolved modules in the mind) is to go all the was positive, disregard risks, and others,  (maybe not happy, at least aggressive) and the feature of depression is to get you to detached, avoid risk, avoid others. And when your rhythms are going all over the place, you get a mixed state, so the distress comes from the features of your mind not even having any direction you can get behind and it feels like you have lost your soul, and the feeling of loss is incredibly damaging to your sense of safety, of knowing, of anything. The stress and inflammation leads to real pain and discomfort. The way you feel awful after you have been angry, and sick after being heartbroken, all at once.

Any kind of change like this should be brought to the attention of their doctor, but I'd be asking is IPSRT type interventions the right thing or dbt type interventions? Before I'd want to try an extra med or something like that.
