AskVegans,fqmwlss,t3_gjpk2p,1589484742.0,I gained 5-10 pounds when I went vegan. But I was also powerlifting competitively and really focused on the gainz... so I wasn't mad. I don't know that my experience is generalizable to most people.
AskVegans,fqe41so,t3_gibpff,1589301406.0,I suggest  determining how much of a recipe you need to make to last you two weeks! You can freeze one week's supply and keep the other week's supply fresh in your fridge. That way you're able to buy more groceries per trip but don't have to worry about your food going bad (and meal prepping absolutely rocks if you're not doing it already!)

DebateAVegan,fq1tdnh,t1_fpzkpdu,1589049028.0,"If there were ""less"" of us, or none of us?

If we're going the route of ""if fewer humans were around it would reduce suffering""... that means some people would still need to reproduce, to keep the population growth rate on par with the death rate (i.e. no net growth). The next question becomes: how do we decide which people should be able to have children?

Do you see where I'm going with this?"

AskVegans,fpspnhx,t3_gfchv3,1588877483.0,"For me, the cognitive disconnect was coming from how I was defining love. When I love someone, knowing they are suffering pains me. If I love someone, I avoid harming them whenever possible. If we are able to be vegan and we keep choosing to eat meat, we are actively choosing to continue harm to animals we claim to love.

If there are indeed scenarios where someone truly loves someone else while intentionally, systematically, and repeatedly causing them harm... I would love to hear about them.

I am sorry if people have been mean to you. However, please consider how you define love. Is ""loving animals"" getting warm fuzzies when you see a cute dog or cat? Or is it treating all animals with respect and dignity, regardless of whether they give you warm fuzzies?

Most of us who are vegan were, at some point, carnists ourselves and went through the same uncomfortable feelings of guilt and bargaining. These are tough questions without easy answers.

I wish you the best in your journey

AskVegans,ffgvwkb,t1_ffgvj0g,1579916407.0,"Oh, I am so sorry if it came across like I was accusing you of being against veganism. Not what I intended at all! 🙂

I think it has to do with what's considered reasonable by most people? I mean, there will always be exceptions. We have to keep our focus on minimizing suffering of all beings while also eliminating the barriers that stop people from doing their part in that (which in turn can alleviate a lot of suffering). 

I think most of us can agree that having to walk two miles just to get any vegan food at all is overly difficult in our modern world. No one should have to do that. I think most of us can probably empathize with that and should do all we can so that that person can have their vegan food without having to trek. This is where intersectional veganism becomes especially relevant. So I think we might be asking the wrong question when we say ""how difficult does it have to be?"" We should be asking ""how can we collectively help ease whatever burdens are preventing people from living in line with their morals?"""
