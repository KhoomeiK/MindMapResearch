relationship_advice,ffc1o9n,t1_ffc1jf6,1579789287.0,"at the time we were going through issues relating to my dependency and not giving him enough space so he would complain about that and be very irritable/angry with me, its better now because i‚Äôm receiving treatment for mental health issues but i still feel so guilty"
relationship_advice,fdugx09,t1_fdugjnp,1578732796.0,"my family is also very emotionally abusive and toxic and living with them caused me to self harm as well as be extremely suicidal for years, as well as them not having space for me. i only have 2 friends and one lives outside my state the other isn‚Äôt comfortable with anyone staying at her place. i don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôm ‚Äúready‚Äù but i don‚Äôt want to be alone in this world again i can‚Äôt take it and i hate myself for ruining every chance i get at love and happiness"

relationship_advice,fduezmg,t1_fduen9h,1578732131.0,"yes ive been struggling with it for as long as i can remember, bipolar amongst other things diagnosed. i think its my fault bc he used to be understanding, kind and empathetic but i think i pushed him too far, smothered him and don‚Äôt give him enough space so now he is constantly angry and impatient with me and exploding at me. i only work once a week bc i had a temporary license for my original position that expired so i have to do this to hold my position till i take my exam for my permanent license."
relationship_advice,fddq3dy,t1_fddpwy7,1578320941.0,"no not at all, and he said that‚Äôs why i should‚Äôve known better than to expect that after sex. but its something we always do after that‚Äôs important to me given my experiences and things... :("
relationship_advice,fddnsfn,t3_ekue8i,1578318962.0,"also, he says he supports me and comforts me nonstop everyday (even though he always asks how im feeling and i try not to overshare), but that when he‚Äôs angry at me, i don‚Äôt leave him alone and that‚Äôs the problem. i understand that but i also think its unfair to be this mean and trigger someone and tell them too bad, process it alone."

depression,fdcsxv1,t3_eknz1l,1578283421.0,"are you sure you‚Äôre not just blaming yourself and being hard on yourself? people with depression can have toxic behaviors sometimes and acknowledge and try to change them, but that doesn‚Äôt automatically make you an abuser or mean you were manipulating him. can you elaborate on what you think you‚Äôve done that makes you think that of yourself? i relate to a lot of what you said."
depression,fdcsdt5,t3_eko6pb,1578282956.0,"i feel the exact same tonight, down to each person in your life and how they treat u, but believe me- killing yourself isnt the answer. if they don‚Äôt feel like shit about how they treat u now, that won‚Äôt change it permanently. the most important thing is trying to remain positive and understanding that even though these ppl are shit, ur life and u have so much potential to be so much more. we can do this. reddit can make u feel less alone than u think, so rant on here as much as u need to, but don‚Äôt give up. we get it and we are here for u."
depression,fdcs2fr,t3_ekoa9w,1578282687.0,"is medicaid an option where u live? maybe have ur therapist help u look into programs or hospitals that can do things for low income patients, assuming thats the problem, or people without insurance."
