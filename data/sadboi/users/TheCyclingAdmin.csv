dogs,euqsi9x,t1_euqs2f6,1563984611.0,Thank you!  I'm at the dog park next door to my place and another person mentioned catahoula mixed in as well.
sex,estna9u,t3_c911yk,1562270086.0,"At 6.6"" girth I can only really wear the custom condoms from my one comfortably.   I've been circumcised as an adult due to medical issues and it's a lot easier after the circumcision to wear them but the wrong size can still squeeze you soft or cause a lot of discomfort at the base.  When I was uncircumcised still the condoms would break more frequently due to friction regardless of added lube used internally and my foreskin would often end up sore."
nonmonogamy,es0hzg9,t1_erxsqhk,1561475748.0,This is just as bad in tech when you're on an all male team (I'm bi/heteroflexible).  The constant need to prove your machismo from a bunch of basement dwelling nerds is ridiculous.
ADHD,erhric2,t1_ergkc1q,1560881320.0,"The analogy I use to explain it to people is that your brain is not able to prioritize anything, every perceivable sensory input is given the same priority which creates the brain fog during situations like this because it gets overloaded.  Once you hit a tipping point in that overload you have to shut down and try to get out of that situation to gather your thoughts again."
