I've been out of college for 6 years now and while I'm conversational and can understand most things (depending on the accent lol, Castilian Spanish is still hard for me and Caribbean Spanish may as well be a foreign language), I'm far from fluent. The reality is, other than talking to my host mom, I spoke 95% English in Argentina. I always found Spanish classes to be easy so I didn't put much work into them. I cannot motivate myself to study outside of a classroom setting (and forget practicing speaking!), so now that I'm back in grad school I enrolled in an undergrad Spanish class, just to force me to practice for a few hours each week.

Even if you can't fully immerse yourself in another country, if you put the work in to study (speaking, reading, listening) for a couple of hours every day, some degree of fluency will come to you.

Because I have this history, I've been very hesitant to dive into the low FODMAP diet. It has helped me a lot to remind myself that I'm doing it so that I can feel better (for example, I know that if I eat dairy ice cream, I'm not going to have a good time)-- not for any other reason, such as weight loss or the notion of ""health"" from a nutrition perspective. I've also made an effort rather than to say ""I can't eat that"", to look for something I can eat instead. For example, if black beans don't feel good, rather than just avoiding all of my favorite meals with black beans, I replace them with tempeh instead. That has really helped me avoid the feelings of restriction.

I also get the budget thing. I'm a grad student in a relatively high COL area (not nearly as high as NYC, but one of the cities that's on the up and up). Some grocery stores are way cheaper for certain items than others. By shopping smart (and shopping sales!), I'm able to buy groceries for about $40/week (not the cheapest, but my shopping trips always include a couple of bars of chocolate as well as some vegan alternatives).

IIRC, I listed about $100 to deactivate, but the computer instead gave me $0, so I didn't deactivate.

FortCollins,fnmtfsu,t1_fnlkha9,1587077828.0,Can you share more about your experience? My dad is looking to switch to T Mobile from Verizon because it's cheaper and as a fully-fledged adult I don't want to protest if it means being kicked off the family plan-- but if it's really awful service I might have to.
FODMAPS,fnm92c7,t1_fnm86xl,1587067211.0,"I'm not an expert but I'm studying food science and nutrition in a masters program right now. Gluten-free flour is going to be much more dense and lower volume because gluten is responsible for essentially holding the ""rise"" in place and setting the structure. If you use gluten-free flour, I would add in some vital wheat gluten (unfortunately I'm not sure how much-- you may need to experiment). You could also try adding egg, which can also provide structure."
running,fnlz4hb,t1_fnlvjop,1587062265.0,This is awesome.
climbing,fni9qlb,t3_g1tsxf,1586976364.0,I thought this was in a hiking group and was going to scold you for spreading the word. The secret's already out among climbers. Carry on.
antidiet,fnhhvmy,t1_fnh3s3y,1586962702.0,"This is true-- the research is definitely fairly lacking for long term studies, but there have been studies done on other low-carb, high-fat diets. Low-carb diets have been associated with atrial fibrillation, vitamin deficiencies, digestive issues (like u/mizmoose said), possibly an increase in ""bad"" cholesterol, triglycerides, etc. due to overeating saturated fats, pancreatitis, etc."
antidiet,fnft4kr,t1_fnfgdrs,1586914908.0,People use it as a lose-weight-quick scheme. It has shown pretty effective at that-- but with deleterious long-term health problems.
skiing,fne45s6,t1_fnaejjh,1586882738.0,Dammit. I got into town the day they announced the closure. I knew I missed out but this hurts.
FODMAPS,fnbnljm,t1_fnbh8kh,1586818748.0,"That jerky sounds terrible lol, I hate coconut. Good to know that kind of thing is out there though!

Do the dates not give you trouble with the power balls?"
FODMAPS,fnbda36,t1_fnbcqtx,1586813492.0,"This is super helpful! Thank you. I think I may need to buy a dehydrator lol and emphasize meals over snacks (unfortunately). I'm pretty used to just munching on dried fruit all day and having some couscous and dried mushrooms for dinner.

Hope we can get out there this summer!"
CoronavirusColorado,fnb3k8k,t3_g0jhvc,1586808599.0,"Is anyone else seeing a lag on their tax returns as well? I filed in early Feb. Got my state return within 2 weeks but still waiting on federal. I used the fancy tracker thing on the IRS and it says received by not approved. (If it helps, I'm a grad student so I make next to nothing and my return was only a couple hundred dollars. Can't imagine I'm being audited for that lol)"
FortCollins,fna3brj,t1_fna2pll,1586790217.0,"I guess I should have noted that I'm down in Denver for the quarantine, but it's good to hear there are some local trails up there that aren't sardined with people like all the trails in Golden.

(Side note, I drove past the Dadd Gulch trail with my dad in the fall and he wanted me to check it out for him-- guess I'll have to now.)"
FortCollins,fna0wip,t1_fn9tf7e,1586788854.0,You can if you don't have to drive to get there.
FortCollins,fna0v8e,t1_fn8ry6r,1586788834.0,"The rule isn't that cut in stone. The impression that I (and all the outdoors advocacy groups) are getting is that if you have to drive somewhere, you can't go. Clear Creek County has closed all of its county roads to non-locals. It looks like several other counties are considering the same thing."
GradSchool,fn864f3,t3_g05pg1,1586734713.0,"hahaha I appreciate this so much. I'm in STEM now but my undergrad was in the social sciences, so I guess I get the best of both worlds here."
