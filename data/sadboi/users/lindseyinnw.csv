Second, we are in a worldwide effort right now, when it is all Over the news.  No one can claim they just didn’t know.  Once this is mostly over, yes we will probably live in a world where we don’t know who might be infected.

Third, this virus is very different in that it is most contagious before there are any symptoms at all.  That’s not true of the flu.  Also, with the flu there’s no “asymptomatic” carriers (that I know of).  So, most people actually feel sick when they are contagious, and most people know who or where they got it from.  This makes it much easier to behave in a safe way while also  functioning in normal ways. 

I mean, I’m hope this pandemic does teach us the easy ways we can share less viruses.  It seems like taking temps at nursing homes and airports and schools  should be a Lasting norm.  Washing hand more, shaking hands less, wearing masks if you have a cough....it would be lovely if these could be permanent changes so that we *aren’t* inadvertently violating the non aggression principle."

bipolar,fqscsof,t3_gkocu0,1589603878.0,"The best way to do this is to totally shift your entire life to the overnight schedule.  Wake up and go to sleep at the exact same time each day.  

So, let’s say your shift is 8pm-4am.  

Zero caffeine.  Absolutely none.  You can’t keep yourself awake that way and it’ll keep you from falling asleep.  

Give yourself maybe an hour of travel and electronics, checking phone after shift, then put it on DO NOT DISTURB and plug it in far away from you. 

Create a calming sleep routine.  Maybe hot shower with lavender soap, jazz music, listening to a book on tape.  NO ELECTRONICS.  Turn of lights, close shades, put on sound machine, put a note on outside of your door if you’re in an apartment. Put on actual PJs.  Your total routine start to finish is 45min to an hour.  So you’re lights out by 6am.

Give yourself a certain amount of time6,8,10 hours. Whatever works best for you.  Don’t change it- even if you don’t sleep well some nights.  ALWAYS get up with your alarm- always.  There are some fitbits that will monitor your sleep and wake you up gently when you are coming up out of REM.  That might really help here.


When your alarm goes off, BOUND out of bed.  Think of the most exciting feeling you can imagine- Christmas morning, winning the lottery, team winning super bowl.  Imagine it, pump your fists, bounce around.  I know this sounds insane, but if you’ll fake it every single time soon you’ll get a burst of energy when your alarm goes off.  

And this is super important- open every single curtain
And blind, turn on every lamp and light. Go stand in the sun if possible.  For at least 10 minutes.  Sunlight is the best way to change your hormone into “awake” mode.  Tell your brain it is morning every single day at the exact same time/ even if it’s actually 3pm.

Create a “morning” routine so you don’t lay around. Take a shower, put on real clothes, brush your teeth, nows your chance to drink a cup of coffee. 

Ok, now it’s time to have social time.  Let everyone know you’re available from 3:30 on.  Fill this time up. Leave the house to get groceries.  Meet with friends.  Get some exercise. Do chores. Have a 4-7pm “game night.”   Spend time in the sun as much as possible. Don’t waste these hours- They are precious. 


Do this schedule 7 days a week.  Seriously.  You’re now a vampire.  Own it and don’t leave that schedule unless it’s Mother’s day or extremely important."

I loved reading.

I loved painting my nails.

I loved being in my bed.

I loved listening to music.

I loved slow, intense exercise.

I totally hate having people over, no matter how many blogs tell me otherwise.

I will never run my own business.  I will never be a community leader.  I will never be the mother or grandmother who is super thoughtful and always present.

Instead of “you are yelling a lot” maybe “Mom, you never yell at me but this week you have three times!!  You’re really hurting my feelings and I don’t like being screamed at.
Do you think instead when you’re frustrated you could go on a walk?  Maybe later you can write down what is frustrating you and we could talk about it in a week or two when you aren’t manic?”

“Mom, I can tell you aren’t sleeping.  When you don’t sleep I’m not sure you will make good decisions for our family.  I worry about you driving.  Sometimes you can’t remember important things!  I’m scared!!  
Do you think you could take more Seroquel this week, just for me?  I would feel safer/better if you were getting a few hours of sleep.”

Also, at the lower income schools, kids aren’t showing up to zoom calls or turning in work.  One teacher I spoke to only had 5 kids show any progress on a project she assigned.

bipolar,fqnwq3r,t3_gjx6bl,1589502912.0,"I guess my advice is to start really keeping a detailed mood tracker.  Because you need to know what is “you” and what is “manic you.”  

When I am manic I have to forfeit some of my adult rights and responsibilities.  That is difficult.  But the truth is that I make terrible decisions, don’t listen to advice, overspend, and endanger my family when I am making big decisions in a hypomanic state.  So, I have to know that I’m there, so that my family can talk me down from big decisions.  

(For example, when I’m manic I am not allowed to buy anything from Amazon without asking permission.  I can’t buy anything over $50 at all until I’m out of my manic state, and if I need to go to a store I have to have a “chaperone.”)

So, it’s very helpful to figure out what your possible triggers are, what your early signs are, a way of communicating how “high” you are to friends and family, and a way of knowing things are tapering off.

It’s also helpful to go back through your personal history, now looking thru the lens of bipolar, and see if you can identify episodes.  What are the biggest fights you’ve had?  What are your biggest embarrassments?  Did you try to suddenly start any business ventures or remodel something in the spur of the moment.  As you think back you may learn a lot about your episodes."

I also allow people to put me in “timeout” when I really get spun up.  Because I’m not able to make the good decision to go to my room and remove myself from the situation.

When you are in a social setting try to just smile more.  Remember to make eye contact and lean forward.  Try to use more hand motions when you are talking.  Try to respond to her ideas with a real reaction- like “Wow that’s amazing (then ask a question)” rather than a more neutral response.

bipolar,fqmgjkb,t3_gjqlv1,1589477084.0,"I was really worried about being “flat,” but that hasn’t happened.  There’s lots of meds that are more nuanced than they were 10 Or 20 years ago.


I think it comes down to “how bad could it get.”  Write  down some of the worst things that have happened.  And then double it.  Could you clear out your savings or 401k?   Could you get violent? Could you break someone’s trust? Could you get so depressed you can’t climb out of it, and lose your job?

The answer is yes.  None of us gets to “control” how bad it gets.  We think we are fine, and we are a self-controlled person, or that we’ve set up safeguards.  But really that’s a lie.  Some of us are certainly further down the spectrum than others, but all of us have infinite capacity for destroying our own lives and hurting others.

So, just bite the bullet and get on some meds.  Get into therapy.  Figure out how to communicate your needs and disease to the people closest to you- which you can’t do without an actual diagnosis."

If the medicine works then you have bipolar lol. 

It’s important to see a doctor though, because there are medical conditions that can mimic these symptoms.  A blood test or two might be helpful to make sure there’s not something else going on."

bipolar,fqmce2q,t3_gjpf46,1589475128.0,"I think it’s important to remember that everyone has their struggles.  Yours is bipolar, and that’s frustrating because it’s inside of you and people can’t see it from the outside. It might feel unfair.

But other people have struggles you can’t see.  They might have severe headaches, or an abusive stepdad, or dyslexia.  

So I think it’s really important to own it rather than resent it.   “This is my battle.  I’m doing the best I can.  I’ll have good days and bad days.  It’s not my fault- but there are things I can do to make it better.”


Lots a lots of self-love, grace and self-forgiveness is also important.  You’re gonna have days you regret, people you hurt.  So just learn to say to yourself “Welp.  That happened.”  And then go back and say “So....the other day I said (or did) this thing and I know I hurt your feelings.  I don’t even really feel that way, and I don’t know why I said it, but I’m so sorry I hurt you and I hope you can forgive me.”"

I can track my first hypomanic episode to when I was 19 and having the time of my life on a gap year excursion.  

My first depressive episode was during middle school during a very stressful year for my family. I think it was a confluence of events- brother going to college, moving to a new house, struggling with asthma, and middle school angst.  But if I hadn’t been pre-programmed to go down I don’t think I would have. There were just as many joyful things happening during that time."

As a person who is naturally kinda meh/disinterested it’s really helped.

I’ve also made lists of things that I know I like and tried to schedule those in or be intentional.

Like, I may love the smell of orange body wash, but depression makes me say it doesn’t matter and it’s too much work to go buy it.

Bipolar often manifests in the late teen years, so you likely haven’t “always had it:”.  It’ll take a bit of investigating on your part to try to figure out which of your behaviors in the past are the “real” you, and which are the “bipolar” you.  

You’ll find that a lot of things you are ashamed of, or you can’t figure out why you were so angry or argumentative,  also coincided with times you couldn’t sleep, you were super excited about a new project or idea, and you started moving furniture or painting something.  Those are good signs you were in a hypomanic episode.

Please download a mood tracker app. We like Daylio and Emoods around here.  Then you can start figuring out what the beginning, middle, and end of an up episode looks like, or signs you might be heading down into a depressive state.  This is super helpful, because you can warn family and friends, make adjustments to your calendar or commitments, or put some safeguards in place like letting someone else hold onto your money or car keys. 

Medicine is awesome- I’m glad to hear you are starting on it.  You’ll be on it the rest of your life.  Just like a diabetic.  There’s no outgrowing this, or getting healthy enough to get off meds.(in my opinion) So, just make peace with it and a commitment to take it even when you don’t think it’s necessary.

But medicine won’t stop the cycles- you’ll still go up and down- just hopefully in a less destructive way.  My meds took a full 2 months to kick in, and even then I had to go back in for an adjustment.   Call your doctor if you don’t like what’s happening- that’s what he’s there for.  

I’m glad you got a diagnosis!!  This is the start of a long journey, but the diagnosis will make sense of
Some things that have just been frustrating up until now.  Blessings!"
