Third, this virus is very different in that it is most contagious before there are any symptoms at all.  That‚Äôs not true of the flu.  Also, with the flu there‚Äôs no ‚Äúasymptomatic‚Äù carriers (that I know of).  So, most people actually feel sick when they are contagious, and most people know who or where they got it from.  This makes it much easier to behave in a safe way while also  functioning in normal ways. 

I mean, I‚Äôm hope this pandemic does teach us the easy ways we can share less viruses.  It seems like taking temps at nursing homes and airports and schools  should be a Lasting norm.

So, let‚Äôs say your shift is 8pm-4am.  

Zero caffeine.  Absolutely none.  You can‚Äôt keep yourself awake that way and it‚Äôll keep you from falling asleep.  

Give yourself maybe an hour of travel and electronics, checking phone after shift, then put it on DO NOT DISTURB and plug it in far away from you. 

Create a calming sleep routine.  Maybe hot shower with lavender soap, jazz music, listening to a book on tape.  NO ELECTRONICS.  Turn of lights, close shades, put on sound machine, put a note on outside of your door if you‚Äôre in an apartment. Put on actual PJs.  Your total routine start to finish is 45min to an hour.  So you‚Äôre lights out by 6am.

Give yourself a certain amount of time6,8,10 hours. Whatever works best for you.  Don‚Äôt change it- even if you don‚Äôt sleep well some nights.  ALWAYS get up with your alarm- always.  There are some fitbits that will monitor your sleep and wake you up gently when you are coming up out of REM.  That might really help here.


When your alarm goes off, BOUND out of bed.  Think of the most exciting feeling you can imagine- Christmas morning, winning the lottery, team winning super bowl.  Imagine it, pump your fists, bounce around.  I know this sounds insane, but if you‚Äôll fake it every single time soon you‚Äôll get a burst of energy when your alarm goes off.  

And this is super important- open every single curtain
And blind, turn on every lamp and light. Go stand in the sun if possible.  For at least 10 minutes.  Sunlight is the best way to change your hormone into ‚Äúawake‚Äù mode.  Tell your brain it is morning every single day at the exact same time/ even if it‚Äôs actually 3pm.

Create a ‚Äúmorning‚Äù routine so you don‚Äôt lay around. Take a shower, put on real clothes, brush your teeth, nows your chance to drink a cup of coffee. 

Ok, now it‚Äôs time to have social time.  Let everyone know you‚Äôre available from 3:30 on.  Fill this time up. Leave the house to get groceries.  Meet with friends.  Get some exercise. Do chores. Have a 4-7pm ‚Äúgame night.‚Äù   Spend time in the sun as much as possible. Don‚Äôt waste these hours- They are precious.

bipolar,fqnwq3r,t3_gjx6bl,1589502912.0,"I guess my advice is to start really keeping a detailed mood tracker.  Because you need to know what is ‚Äúyou‚Äù and what is ‚Äúmanic you.‚Äù  

When I am manic I have to forfeit some of my adult rights and responsibilities.  That is difficult.  But the truth is that I make terrible decisions, don‚Äôt listen to advice, overspend, and endanger my family when I am making big decisions in a hypomanic state.  So, I have to know that I‚Äôm there, so that my family can talk me down from big decisions.  

(For example, when I‚Äôm manic I am not allowed to buy anything from Amazon without asking permission.  I can‚Äôt buy anything over $50 at all until I‚Äôm out of my manic state, and if I need to go to a store I have to have a ‚Äúchaperone.‚Äù)

So, it‚Äôs very helpful to figure out what your possible triggers are, what your early signs are, a way of communicating how ‚Äúhigh‚Äù you are to friends and family, and a way of knowing things are tapering off.

It‚Äôs also helpful to go back through your personal history, now looking thru the lens of bipolar, and see if you can identify episodes.  What are the biggest fights you‚Äôve had?  What are your biggest embarrassments?  Did you try to suddenly start any business ventures or remodel something in the spur of the moment.  As you think back you may learn a lot about your episodes."

I think it comes down to ‚Äúhow bad could it get.‚Äù  Write  down some of the worst things that have happened.  And then double it.  Could you clear out your savings or 401k?   Could you get violent? Could you break someone‚Äôs trust? Could you get so depressed you can‚Äôt climb out of it, and lose your job?

The answer is yes.  None of us gets to ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù how bad it gets.  We think we are fine, and we are a self-controlled person, or that we‚Äôve set up safeguards.  But really that‚Äôs a lie.  Some of us are certainly further down the spectrum than others, but all of us have infinite capacity for destroying our own lives and hurting others.

So, just bite the bullet and get on some meds.  Get into therapy.  Figure out how to communicate your needs and disease to the people closest to you- which you can‚Äôt do without an actual diagnosis."

My first depressive episode was during middle school during a very stressful year for my family.

Bipolar often manifests in the late teen years, so you likely haven‚Äôt ‚Äúalways had it:‚Äù.  It‚Äôll take a bit of investigating on your part to try to figure out which of your behaviors in the past are the ‚Äúreal‚Äù you, and which are the ‚Äúbipolar‚Äù you.  

You‚Äôll find that a lot of things you are ashamed of, or you can‚Äôt figure out why you were so angry or argumentative,  also coincided with times you couldn‚Äôt sleep, you were super excited about a new project or idea, and you started moving furniture or painting something.  Those are good signs you were in a hypomanic episode.

Please download a mood tracker app. We like Daylio and Emoods around here.  Then you can start figuring out what the beginning, middle, and end of an up episode looks like, or signs you might be heading down into a depressive state.  This is super helpful, because you can warn family and friends, make adjustments to your calendar or commitments, or put some safeguards in place like letting someone else hold onto your money or car keys. 

Medicine is awesome- I‚Äôm glad to hear you are starting on it.  You‚Äôll be on it the rest of your life.  Just like a diabetic.  There‚Äôs no outgrowing this, or getting healthy enough to get off meds.(in my opinion) So, just make peace with it and a commitment to take it even when you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessary.

But medicine won‚Äôt stop the cycles- you‚Äôll still go up and down- just hopefully in a less destructive way.  My meds took a full 2 months to kick in, and even then I had to go back in for an adjustment.   Call your doctor if you don‚Äôt like what‚Äôs happening- that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs there for.
