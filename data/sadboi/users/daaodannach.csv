halifax,fohqxge,t1_fohq6kt,1587770927.0,"Perhaps you could just mention it to Urchin if you’re willing (and we won’t go through 311)? I looked there earlier and didn’t see any dog poop, the barrel and tree were the Canteens, I just talked to them. A construction site cleaner seems standard so I’m not sure why this is still here 6+ months later."
halifax,fohmln6,t1_foh46ix,1587768488.0,Are you the owner of the building (or a tenant) that went up behind the canteen?

gardening,etfm8ke,t3_cbi696,1562772819.0,Zucchini or buttercup squash seedling (can’t quite remember) that I bought a month ago. Initially it wasn’t getting enough light but have moved to a better location. It only has the one true leaf and hasn’t grown at all since I bought it. Ideas?
getdisciplined,erl0cm7,t3_c2cxro,1560975411.0,"Impulse control is a little known but very common symptom of ADHD, consider getting a referral to a psychiatrist and possibly trying medication and therapy if prescribed—both of which are highly effective.

ADHD,eqrh043,t3_bzchsi,1560260692.0,"20mg is a fairly low dose of Vyvanse, I’d suggest booking another appointment with your doctor and bringing up the unfavourable side effects. 3 months is enough time to get past the honeymoon phase of the drug and get a better idea of how to affects you on a day to day basis.

Your doc may suggest a drug that better fits the comorbidity of your adhd/depression/anxiety."
ADHD,eqrgq0x,t3_bzc3ht,1560260475.0,"I experience this too, I’m either ice cold or I fall hard and fast. It may be linked to the emotional impulsivity in ADHD or in my case also how ADHD has caused me to isolate a bit so when I do come across a good fit I tend to over invest."
ADHD,eqrgjkd,t3_bzc64t,1560260338.0,"We’re glad you’re here and we’re glad it’s helping. Keep taking those daily steps to improve, you’ve got this."
ADHD,eqrggt1,t3_bzbweo,1560260277.0,"Your daily routine is your best test/retreat strategy as it’s what you’re trying to improve anyway. I’d suggest taking notes (we benefit from that anyway) or just adding a section to your journal so you can look back and see how you behaved on a certain dose or with no medication. It will likely be subtle, but medication is effective for something like 90% of those with ADHD, finding the proper dose and medication is key."

halifax,eqjy5it,t1_eqjcu50,1560113180.0,Great thanks for that!
halifax,eqj2hf7,t3_byluny,1560097740.0,Good on your for taking the initiative to do this.
halifax,eqj1og9,t3_byfkt3,1560097349.0,"Bonshaw Logistics aka Brunswick News, they typically either don’t ring and then leave a notice for pickup, or ring at an hour before 8am (at least here, or leave the package somewhere it can easily be stolen. Pickup location is one of several Kent’s stores, and they don’t do second attempts. 

Terrible company. I’m 1 for 4 on having deliveries by them actually reach me.

I’ve called Amazon and complained as well as had them de prioritized as a carrier for future orders. I’d suggest either doing that or having your orders shipped to a local Amazon hub for pickup."
depression,eqiom3c,t3_bycijd,1560090837.0,"Well this post was very well articulated, so I’m going out on a limb and saying this is mostly a lack of confidence in your abilities/imposter syndrome (not to say you aren’t depressed, but that doesn’t mean you are the least bit stupid).

Take it from someone who’s been there...start talking to yourself like your matter (because you do) and from a place of positivity and confidence in your abilities."
halifax,eqegd8t,t1_eq7ad3h,1560003468.0,Ps. Do you know if it’s running yet? I called to get info just now and it goes direct to voicemail saying they’re “closed for the season”.
halifax,eqeeos0,t3_bwcgf1,1560002885.0,"Late to this...but, you can call Amazon dot ca and have them ""deprioritize"" Purolator as a service. They tell me it takes 1-2 weeks to be applied (I did it earlier this week but haven't tested it out yet).

Be thankful you haven't had packages delivered by Bonshaw Logistics/Brunswick News yet. They are delivering here now, don't buzz or knock most times, don't make second attempts, and leave your package at Kent's for pickup."

Numerous cycles under my belt but first time using prov, just a simple cycle this time around of 500mg test e/week, 50mg proviron (25mg am and pm), and asin 12.5mg E3D with pins (adjusted as needed).

Thanks."
