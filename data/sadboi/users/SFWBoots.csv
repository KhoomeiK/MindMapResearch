Then I did ""exit"" to close, and restarted. The problem persists. :(

Solution 2.

White people are normal, until they learn I'm Latino, then I just intrigue them.

This whole thing of racism is so fucking stupid. The answer to racism, as you've noted, isn't simply to create another racist movement - the answer is indifference. You're white? Okay. Black? Okay. Asian? Okay. Latino? Middle-eastern? Etc? Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok.

Second, considering you've actually been feeling better and living a relatively normal existence, I think it's your mom who might be in a ""living hell"" - and shes projecting her stress and frustration on to you.

I know it may not be what you want to hear, but it sounds to me like your mom might be a major source of your mental health issues. This happens sometimes. It happened to me. My mom is an EXTREME (and I mean EXTREME) worrier, and although it was coming from a good place, she'd smother the shit out of me with her worries/fears/concerns to the point that it would literally induce a panic attack in me.

Sounds to me like your mom may have issues accepting herself, her life, her circumstance her SOMETHING - and she's projecting her dissatisfaction on to you. Just how my mom took all HER fears about the world and projected them onto me. It was never about the ""dangerous"" things I was doing, it was always about how dangerous SHE felt the world was. Similarly, it's not about the ""living hell"" your living, it's about the ""living hell"" she's living. Maybe thats why she cant help but break quarantine and go see her friends?

I know its a lot to ask of an 18, but I would advice you to either try to talk to your mom, see if you can see whats bothering her so much. OR, if you're not up to it, learn to distance yourself from her toxic comments - because that's exactly what they are to you: toxic.

Good luck."

It sounds opportunistic, but the fact of the matter is that you have something they don't and they (probably) have something you don't. You have your strength and vitality, and they probably have wealth stored away from their productive days of youth.  

I guarantee you that seniors are more scared than you are. They'd probably wish to be in your shoes, because you're young and strong. Find one that needs help, offer them a SINCERE AND HONESTY service. Maybe they want someone to do errands for them. Maybe they want someone to watch their business, or their home. Maybe they need to repair things around the house - there's a million things they wish they could do but their bodies don't let them...but YOUR body can. 

You'll probably be required to do work that's WAY below your capability, but there's no shame in that. This won't be forever. It's a temporary symbiotic relationship between two people I need.

KindVoice,foz25g6,t3_ga621p,1588183391.0,"Hi. I'm happy to listen if you'd like, but if not here are two little recommendations for you to do right now:

1. Listen to a song called 'Posters' by Jack Johnson, and pay close attention to the lyrics. When I was 15 that song was so relevant to how I felt, and it's even more relevant to 15yo today, for sure!

2. Buy a book called 'Emotional First Aid: Practical Strategies for Treating Failure, Rejection, Guilt, and Other Everyday Psychological Injuries' by Guy Winch. If you don't have money I will gladly buy it for you and send it to a PO box, or digital version or whatever. 

I know everything you experience FEELS real, but I promise is it is not - at least not entirely. Our mind is extremely powerful, it can and does distort reality based in how we are emotionally. Its easy to fall into a perpetual loop of negativity that gets exponentially worse. Please please please consider doing those two things I recommended, and again, feel free to message if you'd like.
