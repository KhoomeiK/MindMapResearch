In reality, these side effects are rare and can be easily delt with if you talk to your doctor about them.

People like us (with anxiety disorders) have highly sensitive alarm systems. We tend to focus on everything that might hurt us while overlooking the good things around us.

Do you have a therapist? I would suggest to shift your focus from the side effects to something else. Think about it as a potion you drink in a video game. Give it a chance to prove to your alarm system that it is a false alarm.

There's a good book out there that refers to this. Here is an excerpt:

""The fight-or-flight mechanism puts your brain on alert to anticipate all possible threats as well as those that have not manifested yet. This is why it turns inwards when it fails to find an external threat. Like a hound dog, it’s on the trail of all possible threats and tries to seek out where the next threat might come from. If you’re continuously anxious, this turns into chronic worry or the “what ifs.” Eventually a “worry about things” becomes a “worry about thoughts” where you worry about the very contents of your mind and fear you’re going nuts. There is a very particular sensation not often mentioned in other literature called derealization that occurs after a person has been suffering from general anxiety for some time. It’s a sense of unreality, as if all the world is an illusion. This sensation causes people to feel very abnormal and is one of the more unsettling sensations associated with anxiety. ""

"" The difference between OCD and perfectionism is the level of rationale applied to the activity or situation.

An irrational response would be continuously washing your hands long after the stain is gone. Most of us aspire for perfection in our lives; a personality trait that originates from childhood where a reward would be given for good work in school.
