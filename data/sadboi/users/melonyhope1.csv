It doesn’t matter how old you are, where you live, or even if you have a bunch of friends. But I’ve come to realize that all things Pass, they really do. I’ve learned if you love someone you’re able to move on someday bc life just goes on, I’ve learned if you feel lonely and miserable one day you just wake up and feel better, and I’ve learned that everything seems like it’s gonna last forever but it doesn’t. I know that sounds fucking cheesy I guess technically we can’t get over everything, but loneliness is something that will pass. It sucks to do it, but if you keep feeling this down maybe you should go talk to a doctor. There’s nothing wrong with getting help to feel better, I wish I had at 16."
