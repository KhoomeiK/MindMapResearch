Enjoy new years eve by getting wasted, you don't need to do 100 shots a minute for that, the odd shot throughout the night should keep you going.
I'd have thought you don't wanna get that so hungover again that you can't throw back shots like you life depends on it D: 
I do you hope enjoy yourself anyway, and get as shitfaced as you want, you just need to adapt to your bodily changes, not try to reverse the protection it's done on yourself."

aspergers,f7835eg,t1_f781x7c,1573483995.0,"Agreed, I'd like to see your sources and concrete evidence that you can't develop ptsd unless you experience a certain type of trauma too. 
I'm happy to exchange information. 
Also I'm not here to refute all studies of ptsd, I'm happy to learn all different theories."
aspergers,f781jep,t1_f7811fu,1573482726.0,"You have disrespected different research, evidence, and theories but only accepting certain facts, and refusing to accept that anyone can feel trauma from different experiences. 

You've disrespected any kind of future research by only relying on scientific ""evidence"" and ""facts"" that could change at any minute. 

The first thing you learn in science is that ""facts"" change rapidly, you know this and have accepted this, but refuse to believe that people can get trauma in different ways than what is currently accepted. If people didn't take this ""post-modernistic"" approached we'd still call ptsd shell-shock."

aspergers,f77zb49,t1_f77yq8p,1573480858.0,"Yeah I'm in the same boat, I study psychology and have CPTSD. However, I think to have respect for psychology and these professors and scientists you need to appreciate that there are different theories on all things psychology, and that nothing is set in stone. The DSMs change regularly for a reason. 

Yes there are different shit things, and some things are shitter than other. I can't argue that being raped is worse than being bullied, but every brain is different and has different thresholds for such things, I shouldn't need to tell you this. Trauma is trauma, and to gatekeep mental illness is only gonna worsen the stigma."
aspergers,f77xxxt,t1_f77g09o,1573479646.0,"Yeah I dont think theres actually a scale that people have decided on a ""severity"" of  case. Trauma is a feeling, and felt differently but everyone.
Also ptsd is different and is handled different by everyone. Same with cptsd, you wouldn't treat a veteran the same youd treat someone  who was molested. In the same mind some veterans are dont develop Cptsd or ptsd.
If you're really interested I  the subject, I'd reccomend reading ""the body keeps score"", it has excellent cases and throws a different perception and light on different types of ptsd. It is as much a spectrum as autism."
domesticviolence,f77ojld,t1_f776te6,1573467912.0,"You'll have more of a chance working through these questions and emotions once you have your freedom.

You definitely do dont have to think about what's next, only that you're free to find out in your own time and space.

LoveIslandTV,esmw7gh,t1_esmvdbn,1562116398.0,"100% agree with this. I hope we see him taking some responsibility, if he didn't like her stubbornness/childishness with some situations he should have voiced that, and if she continued to act like so (which she did) he should have called it off, instead of being passive, which enables her to continue acting like she has been - and now she's gonna think its okay that she acted like that, because it seems like hes does her dirty (which he technically has, but she's not gonna see it that way)  - so she's gonna think he was the problem/asshole and everything she's done has been okay and that she's just a victim and is going to continue to be more stand-offish 
Sad for both off them :(

askpsychology,epa1ot5,t1_ep8qonw,1559120207.0,"Child molesters are more despised because a child is involved, they've hurt something innocent, in the worst way possible. Sex is supposed to be equated with love, so rape is bad enough - even worse when done to a child.
It's also only really recently spoken about and I don't imagine people are used to the idea of it happening yet, especially the older generations as they used to keep it hush - likely not to ruin family names or whatever. 
Reading about pedophilia in books, when instances are heavily described can come across as smut for paedophiles. Where as I suppose when reading about murder it's a lot more normalised, as people have been talking about it for as long as whenever, for glory and all that. 
I rambled sorry."
insomnia,ep4e0u6,t3_btwe1f,1559038452.0,"I take lyrica for general anxiety, it didn't help me sleep but would lessen the anxiety of actually going to sleep. I take amitriptyline along side lyrica which helps knock me out a bit. 
My doctor has talked about some doses of sedatives can wake up your wakey receptors, so it may be worth fiddling with the dosage.
