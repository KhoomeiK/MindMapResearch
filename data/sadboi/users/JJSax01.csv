In a nutshell, depression is a natural symptom of having one or more of what Maslow considered as human needs.

Physiological needs: basically the need for air, water etc.
Safety needs: need for shelter, health, security
Love and belonging: this one is one I see most of here.  It's the need for feel connected to other people.  This one Johann talks about a lot with real examples.  Humans evolved in tribes and for the first time in history, humans are disbanding their 'tribes'.  
Esteem needs: need to be recognized for your efforts
Self actualization: the need to be a part of the bigger picture and help others. The need for creativity."

feedthebeast,ffaght0,t1_ffafvsg,1579735198.0,"You could make several small ones, but the problem with that is you'll have to manually request all the smaller components one at a time then when those sequentially get done, then craft the final step.  A large processor will keep track of what is needed to craft the next component and will do it all.  So if you had something that takes 20 crafting steps, you request the desired output and get it.   I would highly suggest 4-8 bigger CPUs.

Edit: another way to think about it is that one cpu can craft logs into planks into crafting tables.  You don't have to have a cpu for planks then another for crafting tables.  If you want the cpu to do more than one step at a time put more coprocessors in the cpu"
feedthebeast,ff9gm1z,t1_ff8jyba,1579712583.0,"Correct. Only one crafting set per processor setup.  You could probably get away with 4 early to mid game, I maxed that out from time to time so I upgraded to 8.  If you look at the ultimate singularity you will see why you need a big processor. The more items needed in the craft the more space is needed in the crafting cpu. This is late game and you can get away with less early game if needed.

Once assembler can have multiple interfaces connected to it, but it can only do one craft at a time so that slows it down.  The fastest way is to have one interface to 5 molecular assemblers, which isn't space efficient.  Mine has a compromise between space and speed efficiency.  It has 32 interfaces and a bunch of molecular assemblers underneath. I have 4 of these setups.  Late game you'll need more than 2 of these setups for sure.

Those you only need 2 sides to access, one for power, one for the interface.   I've almost always been able to put the machines in a wall, then feed the power from above, or below the machine.  EnderIO Item conduits can stack with energy conduits to give machines power the same side that they output."
feedthebeast,fekkvmw,t1_fekjus5,1579202166.0,"kinda. It can only push items to the machine, not pull them. If the machine can auto output the same side as the input then it acts like the importer from RS and the crafter all in one block. But if the machine can't, you can use some item pipe/conduit to take items from the output and lead it into the same interface used to input.  

The item interface has 3 rows of slots.  I'm not looking at it at the moment so this is from memory.

the top row defines how much of a certain item to keep in the interface, similar to RS's interface.  Say you want to keep 10 cobblestone in, you will put 10 in the top row and it will pull 10 from the ME network and keep it there.  too many it will take the excess out and put it back in the ME network.  The stocked items are what go in row 2.  
row 3 is for the patterns from the pattern encoder 

&#x200B;

Extra info, if you have an interface with more than one block with an item slot, it might not work as you'd expect and put it into the wrong container.   You can use a wrench to point it to the machine you want if needed to avoid weird behavior.  Don't worry about putting other interfaces by it as it ignores them when searching for an interface."

If I understand you correctly, my trick was to put an interface on an item crate (chest would do too, but a crate can be put side by side and holds a lot more) then dumping things out onto the start of the machine with an item dropper or Integrated dynamics or something.  I think you might be able to put the interface right before the start of the input conveyer belt.  I'm not 100% sure I know what you mean by it not using all it needs.

I didn't dive deep into advanced rocketry, just enough to complete it.  I think there is a little info in the guide book, but I think I googled a lot with it.

basic integrated dynamics is easy and imo fun.  But it does get complicated for harder builds.  Super powerful though

basically the world eater is a pickaxe with fortune ten so you can get a lot out of those types of ores.   It's the best way I know of to get the most out of gem type ores like diamonds and coal etc.  This was the first time using nuclearcraft for me too."

I'd wager that if you have something that can take the items out of one machine to put into the next fast enough you wouldn't run into this problem.  so I had elite machines with something like 6 operating slots, with only 2 working. Tl:Dr keep each of those machine types separated.

>  I'm about to tear down almost every machine in my base 

I'll show you some screenshots, I'm also in the process of doing this so it's quite messy.  forgive me lol

> How do I get to where I can set up these rituals? From what I can tell, your rig places stone and uses starlight from the Mineralis constellation to turn that stone to ore, right? 

Honestly I haven't played with it enough to remember it very well.  But I had to make a celestial collector crystals (I automated production with integrated dynamics/tunnels) then you have the attunement altar to bind it to mineralis.  Then make the placeable kind in the crafting altar.  To max out the power I needed 2 placeable kinds (best quality) and one non placeable kind to put in the ritual pedestal.  Then I linked the pedestal's anchor to another in the center of my stone cube.  So your last statement was correct.

> if it uses Astral, I'm guessing it will need to be aboveground 

kinda.  I believe the ritual pedestal and the crystal and altar acceleration needs to have sky access, but my anchor is underground.  [https://imgur.com/lxrTAj0](https://imgur.com/lxrTAj0)   [https://imgur.com/GuzWqfc](https://imgur.com/GuzWqfc) 

i.e. your third paragraph, I have a bunch of screenshots.  You don't necessarily have to look at them all.  Just a visual. general tips and such.  It's just a pain to move things repeatedly.

1) I would make plenty of room for a reactor, I hear mekanism's fusion reactor is really good too, but I chose to go with nuclearcraft's fusion reactor. [https://imgur.com/35gPrE6](https://imgur.com/35gPrE6) (it's fuel gen -->) [https://imgur.com/zOU0qz3](https://imgur.com/zOU0qz3)  
2) Don't skimp on your ore processing room that you'll need.  Expect a lot here especially if you want to keep up with mineralis as you see in my processing that isn't even close to enough.   
(for fortuneable ores) [https://imgur.com/nz5rNdB](https://imgur.com/nz5rNdB) I am using 2 avaritia's fortune x ""world breaker"" setups.  
3) if you're going to go with mekanism ore quintupling or quadrupling you'll need to account for space for hydrogen chloride and oxygen production [https://imgur.com/nFgi8Iz](https://imgur.com/nFgi8Iz) (this setup no longer keeps up at all, so expect more space needed) Hydrogen Chloride needs a STUPID amount of brine (a black hole tank I filled up was NOT enough.  Not kidding) [https://imgur.com/yxGRXzX](https://imgur.com/yxGRXzX) this is my current setup, but I would plan for more.  
4) If you can, I would make an AE2 subnetwork for black hole units for all things needed for singularities.  You will need as much of them as you can get. [https://imgur.com/Niq8dH5](https://imgur.com/Niq8dH5) My hoarding problem finally has a use.  
5) Mineralis to my knowledge doesn't produce nether ores.  You'll still need your environmental tech ore miners [https://imgur.com/Ekz93ma](https://imgur.com/Ekz93ma)  
6) cubic boron nitride takes a large space on it's own.  This is my setup, probably better setups out there. [https://imgur.com/hw4zK7Q](https://imgur.com/hw4zK7Q)  
7) a bunch of advanced rocketry multiblocks [https://imgur.com/6h7k4Ov](https://imgur.com/6h7k4Ov)  
8) crafting core (can be automated with enderio conduits and packaged auto mod) [https://imgur.com/BwM3xdP](https://imgur.com/BwM3xdP)  
9) Draconic evolutions' fusion crafter [https://imgur.com/AZ2lKpo](https://imgur.com/AZ2lKpo)  
10) this is the general setup of how I automated the singularities [https://imgur.com/I4JOGhl](https://imgur.com/I4JOGhl)  
11) This is my calcium sulfate setup [https://imgur.com/KwjhmXq](https://imgur.com/KwjhmXq)  
12) I would recommend automating immersive engineering engineers' workbenches,  and metal presses [https://imgur.com/g9ygGuo](https://imgur.com/g9ygGuo)  
13) don't forget farm area and mob farm area. or t5 blood altar area.  
14) just more pics cause they're the best looking part of my base [https://imgur.com/ZtHb58H](https://imgur.com/ZtHb58H) (notice I have 4 molecular assembler flowers.  You'll need a lot) [https://imgur.com/DeVS2Fl](https://imgur.com/DeVS2Fl) (Mob farm)

obviously there are the standard machines too, but I imagine you already accounted for those."
feedthebeast,feb6wxt,t1_feb6fh2,1578955970.0,"Oh gotcha.  Yeah for what you see here, all I needed was gas conduits.  the being fed from a creative gas tank ^((enigmatica late game has legit recipes for it)) that is what is feeding it it's massive amounts of sulfuric acid."
feedthebeast,feb47wy,t1_feb3o4x,1578955294.0,"Are you playing Enigmatica 2 expert?  I'm working right now and not playing so I can't check but iirc they are really expensive in that pack.

I'm curious about how you're using them now."
feedthebeast,feb29o7,t1_feb13a4,1578954797.0,"(from memory) There should only be one gas in the setup you see here, which is sulfuric acid.  The trickier part is the hydrogen chloride, and oxygen in the final stages of getting ores to ingots.  for that I use EnderIO's gas conduits and change the channels so there is no gas canoodling."
feedthebeast,fearf9y,t1_feankhl,1578951569.0,"I did the autosieves originally but this is exponentially better and wish I would have done it sooner.

For how to generate ore, I got the idea from this video[https://youtu.be/a5yj1kLLnXE](https://youtu.be/a5yj1kLLnXE)

also direwolf20 did it in a recent video, but I wasn't aware of it until someone mentioned it here.[https://youtu.be/TJzbJffxj5E](https://youtu.be/TJzbJffxj5E) (and I think his video right before this one judging by the title.)  Direwolf's is impressive for it's size.

the machines are from mekanism.  from memory the chemical dissolution chamber (requiring lots of sulfuric acid) feeds into the chemical washer (requiring water only accepted from the top of the machine), which feeds into the chemical crystalizer giving you 5x crystals of the ore type.  They are hard to upscale because if the amount that goes from one machine to the other is just slightly off, then they will have to be cleared out manually.  They are gasses and integrated tunnels doesn't know how to handle them.  So you have to put them side by side like this to upscale.

after they get crystallized, you have to put them through the chemical injector (requiring lots of hydrogen chloride), then to a chemical infuser (requiring lots of oxygen), then to a purification chamber, then a crusher,  then an enricher, then a smelter, which gives you the ore in 5x ingot form.  This part is much easier to upscale, though the hydrogen chloride, and the oxygen requirements are high, and a new bag of worms to automate.

&#x200B;

In Enigmatica 2 expert, all these machines are really expensive too.  It was a really fun project to do and worth it for me, but with the amount of ore you can get from astral's ore gen, you may consider an easier ore doubling setup instead as they are a) much easier to upscale/automate, b) usually faster and c) much cheaper.  But it's up to you and either way should be a blast if you're anything like me.  For a 100% efficient astral ore gen, I would have needed about 100 more of these setups to keep up.

after writing this I found this resource.  It seems out of date, but a brief overview looks generally correct.  [https://wiki.aidancbrady.com/wiki/Ore\_Processing](https://wiki.aidancbrady.com/wiki/Ore_Processing)"

Would save the separate stone gen though"
feedthebeast,fdwrfim,t3_en9rke,1578761616.0,I know of a ton in 1.12.2.  Mods and modpacks.  It's probably the most commonly played version for modded.  I use twitch launcher and it has a lot of 1.12 stuff
