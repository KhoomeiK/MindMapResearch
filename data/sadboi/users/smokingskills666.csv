Its not supposed to be used constantly. Only animals entirely live in the moment. Foward planning and learning from the past is what makes ys human.
Also look into ""leaning in"" to feelings. Most people who practice mindfulness don't realise you are supposed to do that and basically check out whenever they feel anything uncomfortable."
