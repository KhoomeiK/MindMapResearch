Anxiety,fqan6d4,t1_fqammj4,1589221908.0,"I know Exactly what you mean. I have experienced that as well or the infamous words “No, no. It’s in your head”. I then feel discouraged to even clarify the situation then—I guess it’s all dependent on who you are speaking with. You do right in saying “friends”, in question marks, because true friends will be caring, patient, understanding of your struggles)."
Anxiety,fqa6u8n,t1_fq9dekb,1589213853.0,"Hugs all around!! You’re most welcome! I hope today is peaceful for you (and everyone here—> **anxious as I type this, I didn’t want to leave out the rest of our community that encounter the same struggles—calm & peace to all.)"
Anxiety,fq9cvzp,t1_fq9bu5w,1589193995.0,"I completely understand. Until the moment the issue is clarified, we are in mental torture. I’m grateful we relate, but like you said, I’m so sorry you go through it as well. Thank you for sharing your experience. Sending a comforting hug your way!"
Anxiety,fq9a0zp,t3_ghiqy2,1589191022.0,"You are not alone. I experience this all the time & I have to fight my mind to push it aside; I am often unable to.
I have also been told that “it’s in my head”, but I’m very sensitive to tone, body language so when I notice something is “off”, my anxiety spikes, my mind races with possibilities of what may have upset someone, that it’s because of something I must have done and/or said. Sometimes it’ll play in my mind so much that I have to just approach the person and ask, many times that brings peace. Got to fight the anxiety and nerves when approaching the person as well though, of course!"

Anxiety,fo4yekl,t3_g5lc4j,1587513673.0,"Likewise. I find myself confronting intrusive thoughts quite frequently. I tell myself “I control how much I will allow it to affect me,  I will not allow it to torture me.” 
I will say, easier said than done as I still find myself crying often after I seem to “disconnect” from the moment I am in and instead relive whatever thought is plaguing me. Then I “come back”. Thankfully, this method has at least lessened how long I remain affected. Again, it is still a work in progress for me, daily. Wishing you all peace."
