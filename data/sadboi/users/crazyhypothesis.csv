HPPD,fbdzz03,t3_ecvlat,1576775128.0,"I'm going to add more data, for the sake of completion:

**Current symptoms:** Sleep and libido still a bit off. Intense CEV. Mild OEV (no visual snow, but after images, light sensitivity, and patters moving). Mild mood swings. No apparent DP/DR

**Drugs taken:** July/August - LSD, 4-ACO-DMT, 2CB, lorazepam, and a tiny bit of ketamine, weed edibles, speed and mdma.Lorazepam was only for when we were having trouble to sleep due to previous drug use. I do think now that this is a bad idea for many reasons.The rest I don't remember exactly, they were always low doses, like 90ug lsd max, 20 mg 2cb, 20mg 4-aco-dmt, etc.This was like 3 days out of 6 let's say, like Wed, Fri, Sat, something like that.

**Experience on drugs**: Mild doses, and no bad trips at all. Slight moment of ""holy shit"" when on acid, 20min, and that was it. The rest was all fun and games.

**Previous experience:** She had tried everything before, in the last 2 years, spaced aprox 2 weeks. No ""really"" bad trips, although:-  one time on a strong edible went through a 20 minutes panic of ""can't breathe, can't breathe!""- one time on DMT got stuck ""in between"", panicked because couldn't articulate words.- a couple of times on 4-aco-dmt / LSD went through stages of ""this can't be real"", derealization, scared of the surroundings, kind of freaking out, but always had me around to magically calm her down. Wouldn't call it a ""bad trip"" though, but it might indicate her ""vulnerability"".

**Medications or previous conditions:** None, and none in the family.

**September**:We had to take lorazepam and/or clonazepam for a few nights to be able to sleep properly. We never took them for more than a week, but we had to go back to them a couple of times (which is BAD!). I'm quite sure that a huge part of everything, is actually the withdrawal from the benzos.

**September/October/November:** NAC, ashwagandha, magnesium, vitamin B complex, DHA, inositol, gingko biloba, and probably some more...

**Meditation:** We started meditating, and it helps to chill, and it usually turns her CEV from ""crazy, hyperactive, confusing, even scary"", to kind of ""bearable, even positive"" ones.

**Diet:** We eat healthy, always, although lately she had a couple of sugar binges. We kind of tried keto, but a really lazy one. Didn't change much, but at that point the symptoms were minimal. Might give it another try.

**Exercise:** Frequent, mild. Might need to plan it more from now on (cardio instead of gym, low intensity)

**Warnings:**

1 - 10th of August, after Ozora, she had an episode where a black dot appeared in her field of vision for around an hour. She didn't pay much attention to it...

2 - sleep issues after the binge. Could have also been influenced by a kind of benzo withdrawal

3 - mood swings. Nothing extreme... but noticeable.

4 - low libido, sexual drive, lubrication, ease to orgasm, etc.

The sleep and CEV should have been a warning sign, a call to take a zen chill life far from substances... but failed. Fucking social alcohol, it's so hard to avoid... I'll always wonder what would have happened if alcohol (and benzos) were totally out of the picture."

> Also what studies do you have on cbd oil and these mglur receptors in specific? How would cbd oil help? 

Well, there are some studies, but nothing really conclusive, I didn't even save them. I found one linking CBD with mGlu, in some not fully understood way, but can't find it now. The CBD world is HUGE, it's a whole system in the body that we're just starting to grasp.   
The key is: personal experiences. We tend to ignore this, but we shouldn't. Just too many people consistently report benefits. 

I know you have a thing against CBD, because it comes with Weed... but think about it this way: CBD alone doesn't cause euphoria, hence, if it wasn't because it's naturally found packed with THC, it wouldn't be regulated.   
It would be like a ""Lemon Balm"" tea. :-)

I'm not saying that it's innocuous, not even effective, but at least it has a really good reputation and a low risk profile...   
Would I recommend it to healthy people as tea, coffee, vitamin? NO!  
But damn it, with the dangers and side effects that most drugs prescribed to people with HPPD/VSS/whatever have... CBD should already be the first line of treatment for so many things!

> Anyway, worth the read none the less. I am still curious as to how hormones effect glutamate. I know how they effect gaba.  

Simplified, gaba and glutamate are inversely correlated.

HPPD is a product of the imagination of an opportunistic Catholic anti-drug psychiatrist, that created his career around it without really contributing anything to the problem, semi-validated by some more junior crap ""research"" over time used to build empty careers"

Cortisol is akin to a stress indicator, and stress is a known trigger of symptoms.

Cortisol increases Glutamate, and that's the key"

Drugs,f8bl0a8,t3_dwk0q6,1574439357.0,"Hehe, I've seen this many times too, everyone has a preferred method. And indeed, many many times, thinking exactly about this gets directly translated into my nitrous ""trip""!

I like my method, and I'm going to tell you why :)

First, let me clarify that I have training and experience as diver and freediver, hence I know how the theory (and practice) of how our breathing system work, for how long we can safely hold it, etc etc. The concepts of ""lack of oxygen"", ""hypoxia"", etc, are thrown around around nitrous WAY to frequently, soon, and incorrectly. On top of that... a lot of nitrous practice, and a lot of reading :)

**The method of constantly re breathing into the balloon is NOT efficient, because: breathing makes you tired**, burns your oxygen... you don't want that, you want, just like in freediving, your oxygen to last a long time, while the N2O flows to your mind.

Also, the recommendation of ""don't breathe it back"" that another user posted here, is NOT efficient, because: unless you're extremely confident holding your breath, freediving style (99.9% people ISN'T), you'll breathe out before you need to, and before all the N2O is absorbed, wasting some.

&#x200B;

**The best method:**

1. pre-breathe normal air, two or three full lungs (NOT hyperventilating)
2. breathe in from the balloon
3. hold it for around 20s. You should clearly feel the come up, but still, you shouldn't be feeling an extreme urge to breathe.
4. breathe out back into the balloon (this air will still have some N2O)
5. holding the balloon tight and closed, breathe in and out normal air, full lungs, once (what I do, but this probably requires some practice, is keeping the balloon in my mouth, and breathing air from nose)
6. go back to step 2, but from now on, step 3 won't be 20s but more like 5s-10s.
7. With 4-5 cycles, that's probably it, not worth to keep going

Oh I bet there are plenty, just that this forum isn't open to that, so when someone does talk about it, most likely they get bullied, harassed, insulted, etc etc

It's a shame, because it reduces the information available for everyone. Your experiences are valuable, thanks for sharing! :)"
HPPD,f8auano,t3_dzcxdf,1574412263.0,"This is interesting!

It's fully aligned with my hypothesis of glutamate, over stimulation, inflammation, etc.  Same symptoms happen with any kind of stimulant (including stress), when the brain of some people can't handle it.

 Glutamate and Its Receptors as Therapeutic Targets for Migraine  
[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13311-018-0616-5](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13311-018-0616-5)

> Multiple therapies that target glutamate receptors including magnesium, topiramate, memantine, and ketamine have been reported to have efficacy in the treatment of migraine 

Funny enough, first or second link I follow, I found a mention to ketamine as a possible therapy, of which I started asking months ago, and there was more than one experience of people reporting benefits.

Memantine

HPPD,f888spa,t3_dzi7ll,1574350565.0,"Well, how to know? Who would make the association, if everyone drinks?

My opinion: YES.

There are experiences saying that their HPPD started with a hangover, although after previous (\~1 month) psychedelic consumption. I'm sure there are a lot of people too, with the same symptoms and everything, but without the label ""hppd"" because they didn't consume hallucinogens previously.Most likely, they will end up with this label: [https://www.alcohol.org/comorbid/psychotic-disorder/](https://www.alcohol.org/comorbid/psychotic-disorder/)

Even ""weed"" is failed to mention as a common trigger, because it's sooo common, and most people think it's like water, like food, that people don't even mention it in their stories.

Alcohol is waaay more ubiquitous of course, hence establishing the relationship would be extremely difficult."

HPPD,f84r9j8,t3_dxy1hs,1574258666.0,"As you might have concluded already, the PTSD hypothesis doesn't hold any water.

It is however apparent that bad trips are somehow more likely to trigger hppd. My hypothesis: it all starts with norepinephrine  and cortisol. Both are released with most drugs, even if the experience is good... but way more if the experience is bad, matching the previous observation, also the fact that stressful situations are the worst triggers for hppd, and also coffee as trigger, meditation as improvement, NAC as useful supplement, etc etc. 

&#x200B;

And of course, Visual Snow... exactly the same as HPPD, but without drugs. In that case, you could still think that PTSD plays a role, but when you read a lot of visual snow experiences, you realize again that it's not the case.

The path down from high ne/cortisol could be quite straightforward, or more complicated (most likely), like through semi-localized inflammation, or through the conversion in the body of adrenaline-like molecules into a mescaline-like molecule. This last one is extremely interesting, but I haven't had the time to read further.

Have a look into that, and good luck :)"
HPPD,f84nlsr,t1_f84c968,1574255592.0,">Obviously HPPD is some sort of subset to VSS

Well, I've been saying that since I came here, and I've received plenty of authoritative and convinced opinions on the contrary... so, it's not that ""obvious"" for a lot of people.

I think a lot of people with HPPD like the term because it *sounds* more specific, and creates the illusion of a better understanding and hence a nearer cure."
