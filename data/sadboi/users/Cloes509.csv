spirituality,fkdg3a0,t3_fhsvhp,1584077508.0,"It most certainly is a personal path, but here are my strong recommendations:

Read The Spirits Book by Allan Kardec

Listen the audio book of Conversations with God by Neil Donald Walsh - all 6 of them (you can get it as a pack on Audible, and if you're not currently a member, you can sign up for the trial and get it for free, it's worth $60 cad).

Check out Rosicrucian.org 

At least do some research on these, they have enlightened me beyond words!

A physical activity practice and a meditation practice, along good nourishment and sleep, will help a lot. Also, try and come from a place of love as often as you can throughout your day, your life.

:)

All the best to you!!"

spirituality,fkdfjb4,t1_fkd6b3l,1584076969.0,"> Do you not think yhe world will ever end? 

No, I don't. However, what do YOU mean by world? Life as we know it? Humanity? Earth? My take is that there are an infinite number of places/planets in our universe/dimension/material world where my soul has the ability to incarnate on. As the constant of the universe is change, everything in the universe is impermanent. Therefore, everywhere, life and things appear, experience, and dissapear. And thus as souls we are able to create many different kinds of existence!!!!! Here we are living humanity. Humanity is our world! But... It's not really. Our world is much larger. And just like a snowflake which comes downs from the sky in all its intricacies and beauties, and melts at the touch of the ground as if it never was, so will our planet, someday. Why be so attached? The world will never end. (but if you want to go further in your thoughts, you could say the world never was. Life is an illusion after all. And God/ the world goes through a cycle of being and not being!) 

>What is your take on heaven and hell 

Heaven and Hell is joy and pain in human lives. It is in our minds only. We go to heaven and hell often. Heaven when I enjoy a great family moment under a summer sun with the scents of flowers all around and good music playing, birds singing. Heaven in the admiration of the snowflake. Heaven in the love I share with others. Happiness, wonder, love! That's heaven. Heaven is also through and direct connection with God. Being God. Hell is depression, illnesses, hurtfullness, broken hearts, and so on. It's not a physical place, it's a metaphysical thing. A perception, an attachement. Humans have made it a physical place but I think that's naÃ¯ve."

spirituality,fdafdft,t1_fdaclvg,1578245467.0,"No, they are all unique, and they complement each other very well. The mediums book is very good at understanding disincarnated spirits and how you can interact with them/what to do when they are bothering you, how to understand them, etc. The Genesis was very interesting however a bit too focused on Christianity for me (it's understandable as it was written in France in the 1800s, but keep in mind that Spiritism encompasses all religions on earth and not just Christianity (see Cao Dai in Vietnam, very interesting.)) Also I found a few pieces of info here and there to be... Not outdated per se, they are still valid, but from science we now know a lot more about the topic. Mainly that one was my least favorite but still interesting. Heaven and Hell by Allan Kardec is incredibly interesting!!! It's a Q&A with people/spirits who recently passed away, and talk about their experience. It's illuminating, and makes you understand karma and justice in a whole new light. Also wipes the fear of what's beyond, at least for me. 
I haven't read The Gospel yet."

It's the most scientifically based spiritual doctrine. You'll understand once you read it. Tip: the intro of that book is long and heavy, I recommend keeping it for the end if it ends up making you want to stop reading the book (that's what happened to me and that's what my friend suggested me). No problem on reading the intro at the very end, and skipping to the Q&A right away ;)."

I think it's a goal to aspire to as growing spiritual beings. However, what does matter the most on a daily basis is not necessarily the actions you do but the way you do them, ie the state of being you are in while doing anything at any given moment. What is important, I believe, is being as often as possible our highest self/coming from a place of love: generous, loving, compassionate, patient, forgiving, kind, happy, grateful, etc. And by being these things we do indeed change the world for the better."

Does this means the other ""yous"" impact your current life? If yes, how? Some string theory here? 

To go one step further, thinking about this.. If what we are is ""the universe experiencing itself"", of God experiencing itself, and that God is everything that there is, and that we are all just individuations of this consciousness that has forgotten parts of its whole. Here we all are incarnated and disincarnated, all at once, every possibilities happening in the ever 'now', in the entire grandiose universe.

A little analogy I like to use to explain our individuation of God, the whole, is lights. Christmas lights. Every bulb is a soul. They all seem like individuals when you look at each light bulb.

I also had a hard time living in the illusion for while, distinguishing what's real and what's not real. Every day multiple times I day I would fully bathe in/realize/understand that everything around me is made of atoms created by the energy of God/love, and that I live within this matrix/context that is the 3rd dimension/physical world/context of time and space/context of the relative (Ying and yang everywhere). Then dealing with the fact that time doesn't exist and there is so much grander than the 3rd dimension. That I am the entire universe. How to live with daily little stuff when you have all that in mind?!

I believe my self/individuation of God decided to incarnate here on earth at this time for two reasons: to better myself morally and intellectually, and 2. to make real/be/create the best version of myself at any given moment.

And so I try to be the nicest, kindest, most patient, generous, loving person I can be. Don't get me wrong I get caught up with the illusion of life often and don't act as I always would like to. There is still a huge gap between my thoughts/values and my actions (one who closes this gap is a master!!) but I'm just a human and I've got so much to ""learn"" (or ""remember"" , if you see it from the perspective that I am God, I know everything, I just forgot temporarily in order to live the experience of growing and becoming).

Just, be the best person you can be. That's what your would yearns for, I believe. Be giving, generous, and loving, towards yourself first and then towards others.
