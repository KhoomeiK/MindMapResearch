XXXTENTACION,exclvnn,t1_excktxd,1566153838.0,"“i used to fuck her bruh! i used to fuck her up— but you know what i did? i didn’t touch her, i forgave her.” meaning “i used to beat her in general/i used to beat her in the past but this time, i chilled, didn’t get angry and didn’t lay my hands on her.” i believe he was referring to when he found out geneva slept with another guy while he was in jail?

also somewhere in the confession he was saying how he just wanted the truth from geneva about what she did and he said something like “i told her to just tell me the truth, i’m not gonna put my hands on you” why would he have to mention that he wasn’t gonna beat geneva unless he did it sometime before? and if you or anyone else’s excuse is “maybe she was really scared and thought that he was going to hit her” well if that’s the case then that’s a whole ass red flag that shouldn’t be ignored, you should never be so scared of your partner to the point that you believe they will physically harm you because of something you did.

then he said something like “you’re not going to want to consistently hit her because then it’s gonna fuck her up” meaning “i don’t want to keep hitting her” implying that he’s done it before. 

also, you can connect the dots with everything on this app, in this group forum right here. i found a lot of old screenshots and whatnot searching specific key words in this group. same with twitter as well.

i believe x hit geneva but it’s all gucci because he was trying to change and grow out of his violent, aggressive behavior. just wish it never even happened in the first place and i also wished they never grew up with chaotic childhoods that kind of caused them to be how they are/were. much love to the both of them, though."

XXXTENTACION,ex9gezj,t1_ex9ffai,1566088429.0,"maybe to just get it off his chest finally. i mean, he did always go back to geneva and if we’re honestly speaking, she was supposed to be the one having gekyume in the long run. no shade to jenesis (and obviously no disrespect to gekyume, he’s precious) i don’t know enough about her to do so, but realize how he always ran back to geneva in the end and tell people to leave her alone? he still had love for her, hence why they remained close before he died and were still around each other while the allegations continued even though he could have got in trouble for that. i believe x was regretful and guilty of what he did so in the documentary he might just be like “fuck it, i did it, take it how you want it because i said what i said.”

here’s one of geneva’s friends, jasmine, aka the girl you hear in the phone call while x was in jail describing x and geneva’s relationship: https://youtu.be/BAoSqhPfOvs"
XXXTENTACION,ex9a502,t1_ex99p35,1566085884.0,"she only became a sex worker because she was homeless and poor. she admitted that on her spam page @gothiqa.

and before you or anyone else says that she could’ve just gotten a regular job; last time she did that, x fans stalked and harassed her and she had to leave her job after working there for only 2 weeks. she’s probably honest to god scared of the outside world because she knows how the world perceives her."
XXXTENTACION,ex99r24,t1_ex99et2,1566085717.0,only time will tell. i guess we all just have to wait and see.
XXXTENTACION,ex98u9l,t1_ex97nji,1566085344.0,"think about it. x’s team and everyone who supported him while he was still alive always denied the abuse allegations. they didn’t want him to have a bad reputation while he was alive and a lot of x fans would probably be butthurt if the truth came out and that would probably cause a lot of people to stop listening to x and probably even boycott his music more than they did months ago. if fans and other rappers stopped supporting him in the midst of the allegations, what do you think will happen now? yeah, people may show sympathy because he’s dead but have you not seen how people literally rejoiced x’s death on twitter the day he died? just imagine how more intense it would be.

all i’m saying is that i just wouldn’t be surprised if they left out him abusing geneva in the doc because everyone loves to defend and protect jah’s name, reputation and image. if they do tell all and reveal all, that’s great. just keep in mind that documentaries can be biased and not tell all the facts to screw with someone’s image, that’s all."
XXXTENTACION,ex94tdi,t1_ex93f2f,1566083534.0,"rumor has it that the REAL documentary won’t come out because x admits to abusing geneva. if that’s true, fuck the people who decided to take that out. yes x is dead and i know fans don’t want people to shit on his name, but it is perfectly fine to admit that he wasn’t the greatest person in 2015-2016 and probably even before then as well. everyone realized that late x was not the same x we knew years ago and we loved him for it. he tried to grow out of this dark, depressing, violent person to someone who’s spiritually awake and trying to renew his life and possibly reverse his karma. and if they try to silence geneva, she’s gonna speak regardless. she deserves to be heard."
XXXTENTACION,ex949hz,t1_ex93d8g,1566083289.0,"they hate on her because they want to be in denial of their idol. people put their favorite artists on this make believe pedestal and suddenly believe that they can do no wrong. allegedly, x is going to admit to abusing geneva on the documentary and if that happens, watch people STILL find some way to blame geneva."
XXXTENTACION,ex91r59,t1_ex914pm,1566082165.0,"agreed. at one point i was on x’s side, then i was on no one’s side and said “we will never know what truly happened between them, only they will ever know and keep the truth to themselves.” then while doing a loooot of research and just using common sense while piecing the puzzles together, i came to conclusion that geneva is not a liar. and for everyone who says “well why is her name liar if she never lied? she’s profiting off of ruining a man’s life!” no, she’s mocking the ones who still blame her to this day; it’s irony, sarcasm. and by the way, just because i believe geneva told the truth doesn’t mean i hate jahseh. i can be a fan of him and admit that he has done fucked up things in the past and so has she, their relationship was toxic. i love geneva and i hope she doesn’t commit suicide because of this shit that she has to deal with literally on a daily basis."
XXXTENTACION,ex90mlc,t3_crt2bb,1566081664.0,"if anyone needs a backstory on her rant, read below.

so, geneva has created her own merch and one of the things that comes with her merch is a sticker of her as a voodoo doll, staring in the mirror questioning “am i a liar?” another artist (@teethmeat on instagram) did something very similar instead questioned “why am i so ugly?” and geneva accused of her copying the concept behind the art. geneva and the artists who came up with the concept created the idea in january while the other artist posted their art in july. geneva and teethmeat got into it and of course, people brung up X to attack geneva and she’s obviously tired of it all."
