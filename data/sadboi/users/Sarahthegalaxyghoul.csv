AskReddit,fqzq0ka,t3_gln8tu,1589772759.0,"This might get buried but my dad and mom had it. (We assume my mom, who got it first, brought it home because she worked at a hospital). My dad has cancer and was in between chemo and his surgery when we assume he got it from my mom. (No one in this house went out except for groceries and we wore masks and brought hand sanitizer everywhere, but 3/4 of us were still working.)

My dad and mom are both alive, and I think their cases were pretty mild compared to what could have happened, as it almost would have certainly killed my dad (at very least) had it been severe. They self isolated while they were sick and my bf and I stayed far away and every time anyone used anything in a common area it was wiped down/disinfected. My mom is a cancer nurse so she knew how to self isolate people in a house (because the immunocompromised cancer patients often can't be around other sick family members or children and have to self-isolate in their own houses). My dad was hospitalized twice when the covid kicked in hard but once he was stable enough they just sent him back home, as they did with my mom when she went in for it.

My mom is now back to work after testing and clearing the virus and my dad is still weak and has not cleared it (we got multiple tests done and it is said that cancer patients are taking up to 6 weeks to clear it). So now he has to go back into chemo when he was previously done with it because he was too weak to do the surgery (which was time sensitive- cancer goes out, limited window to take the affected area out before it comes back) and was covid positive so now they have to do ""maintenance chemo"" to re-kill the cancer in case it has surfaced again before he goes through the testing again to see if he's strong enough to have his lung removed in surgery.

 Every complication has decreased his chances at survival but he's still hanging in there and is okay all things considered. It was a very real, very good possibility he could have been dead by now if not for the fact that they seemed to have mild cases, although they were extremely weak during the worst of it."

BipolarReddit,fqgeqw8,t3_gicfw3,1589344401.0,"The one time I was hospitalized I was young, like 8th grade, and I knew it was in my best interest to go, so with the support from my parents and my therapist, I did.

However, I had bipolar tendencies from a very young age. I don't believe it was a coincidence that my first stable and healthy relationship where I wasn't toxic at times was after I got on bipolar meds at 20. My therapist had talked to my mom about it being a possibility for me, but didn't want to move forward with my diagnosis/more accurate medications just yet because I was so young and bipolar in youth is much less likely.

I wish my parents knew what to do with me, how to care for me and my disorder at the time. I wish I knew what was going on with me, wish I hadn't made the mistakes I did, hurt the people I cared about. I wished I had more of a grasp on what I was going through, wish I had an accurate name and information to put to it.

Your son may feel like you've done wrong by him for some time, but with help, understanding, and communication, any reasonable person would realize it was the right call from the sounds of your post. I only wish I had had someone with the information to help me like you do with your son. I think it would be the right choice to do it, and would save him from future heartache and send him on the road to recovery. My parents were passive, they tried their best, but they could've done more. (we've talked it over and we both feel the same about it).

blackcats,fptkffv,t3_gfhaj5,1588892910.0,"Hey everyone, this is Boo, and I found him/her living under my grandma's house, skin and bones, and have been feeding them for 3 days now. The thing is, I cannot take in another cat, as we are at our maximum animal capacity in my home, and I would like this guy/girl to go to a loving home.

I'm not sure if he/she was born a stray but I'm pretty positive they are now, he/she can't be more than a year and a half old, (he/she looks like that awkward ""teenager"" phase of a cat's life). I'm not sure if he/she is fixed, or the sex (if that wasn't obvious) or if he has any non-visible health problems, but all I can see that's wrong with him is a little crook in his tail.

I live in the New Orleans area, and I am willing to drive a reasonable distance to get this little one to a loving home. I would want to talk with you a little to ensure Boo is going someplace safe and loving, but if you have it in your heart, (and your bank account) to take in another black cat, please PM me.

He/she very loving, lets me pet them and pick them up, doesn't appear to have any food aggression, although they are kind of skiddish at times. (understandably).

BipolarReddit,fnbz4e0,t3_g0v169,1586825232.0,"Firstly, if you're behind, TALK to your professors! This is the single most important thing. College professors (more often than not) love when students come to them with problems like this instead of just letting it pile up. Explain your situation (through email presumably) and ask if there's anything to do to bring your grade up/turn in late work. I will assume they understand it's a difficult time for everyone and they should be accommodating as much as possible, but if you never let them know, they can't help.

Secondly, one day at a time. Do however many assignments you can manage in a day without wearing yourself out, and then do something you want. If it helps, pick one bigger assignment and one smaller one. Break papers into sections. Say ""I'll do 2 pages a day, every other day, and I'll dedicate one day to a bibliography"" or whatever works for you.

Try to turn off distractions you don't need during your work, and you can even set an alarm on your phone that tells you when it's been 1-2 hours (or however long) and you can give yourself a break now.

I was checked out of school and went to the doctor, got my medicine for it, and they said eventually it would just go away.

One day I was in the shower and it looked particularly nasty, so I BARELY poked it and it exploded. Still the best pop on my body to this day, and I'm sad I didn't get a chance to record it.

Make shitty Mac and cheese, or anything with cheese really, then proceed to leave the cheese in the pot. Cheese has a lovely habit of getting crusty and stuck on when you don't run water in the pot immediately after you're done with it.

You have to taste your food while you cook to make sure it's good, right? Do it every 5 minutes, and make sure you throw the tasting spoons in the sink too, can't reuse them with this virus going around, can we? And don't get all of the food off the spoon either, leave some to crust up.

You like cereal? Good, eat it as often as possible, and put those bowls and spoons in the sink. Your excuse is that you can't cook, so cereal is perfect.

Bake chicken, it's easy, directions for the chicken part is directly on Google based on what part of the chicken you got. Make sure to use plenty of spices directly on the pan.

Every time you strain something like pasta, use a strainer and make sure some of the noodle bits get mashed in the holes. That's Hell to whoever cleans, too. Might happen to be your sister, who knows.

You bake now too, but you just can't seem to get all of that brownie batter out the pot. Make sure you use whisks too and leave lots of the batter in those also. Those are hard to clean. (Buy box brownies, directions are literally on the box). Have 2 sets of measuring cups? Good, use both.

death,firz179,t3_f9igqu,1582674053.0,"I would check out NDEs

Even if you don't believe in everything you hear about them, the stories are comforting at least, and offer interesting perspectives, as most of them aren't based in/make no mention of religion, but rather are just about the experiences of life after/without a body.

There are also some interesting tests and studies made about them and offer some unique insight.

Edit: they have a few subreddits dedicated to these also.

r/NearDeathExperiences is one of them
r/NDE is another"
NDE,firyjy0,t3_f9jd26,1582673748.0,"This is actually a really good question, considering I wouldn't want to lose my ""oneness"" when I die either.

I wouldn't mind being connected to anyone else, per say, but I would want to keep being myself, minus the earthly pains."
AskReddit,filbzvn,t3_f8eaf4,1582498156.0,"Honestly? My OCD. I always had it, but eventually it turned from ritualistic behaviors to my mind NOT letting me forget things. If I have something to do, it nags at the back of my head until I do it.

I still set calendar dates and make notes but I find myself doing the listed errand/event before the notification for it even comes up. The calendar/reminders become more of a ritualistic behavior in itself than me actually relying on them. It just puts my mind at ease to have them there.

It's nice sometimes, but mostly Hell and a lot of worrying. Good things have come out of it, I have a 3.8 GPA in college going into my senior year, a job, and I'm generally on top of things, but for the most part, I do envy people who fly around with papers tumbling everywhere and busting in the door last minute and still get shit done somehow, even if they do miss a few more deadlines than me."

death,fic0h4y,t3_f7kjig,1582334560.0,"My dad currently has cancer, and the prognosis is not good, so I understand the downhill battle you face seeing your loved one's health deteriorate before you. I personally feel helpless and I hate not having control of the situation and knowing that no one else does, either.

That being said, you're doing what you can for your father to make him happy, and I think this may bring you at least a little bit of peace when he does go.

I would recommend therapy, even before he passes. Even if you go into the appointment and just tell them the facts, (that he's dying etc) it might make you feel better to tell someone else and put your thoughts on it out in the world. Even if past that, you just make small talk, having someone to share words with is something most people take advantage of.

Make it regular too. Once a week, once every other week, whatever. It'll give you something to look forward to and schedule around. It may help you not turn to unhealthy coping mechanisms. I know when I feel myself slipping, I just tell myself to not do anything and to wait until therapy to talk about it, and it gives me a goal with a set time frame to look towards.

And you've taken a necessary step, which is preparing for his death. You don't seem to be in denial, and I personally think this may also help you in the long run.

Best of luck, and my inbox is open if you need to talk"
death,fibzpxq,t3_f7kqxw,1582334022.0,"I used to be scared visiting my elderly great aunt in a nursing home when I was a pre-teen. The elderly would ask me all of these questions like I was their grandkid, or ramble under their breath and do other odd things. I felt like I was bad for not wanting to be there, like I was horrible for being scared because they were just old people who were lonely (for the most part).

I think there's something unsettling about seeing how your body betrays you at an old age (or at any time really) and seeing the bodies/minds failing these people made them uncomfortable to me. It made old age and death really real for me, and I guess being a bit distanced from death it made me nervous.

""What should I do?"" This depends on how close you are to your grandfather. If you think you'll regret not going, or if you think from your grandfather's standpoint that he'd like you there, maybe consider going. 

""How long do I stay?"" As long as your comfortable and as long as you can manage.

""What should I say?"" If he's coherent, maybe talk a bit about small things, whether personal or not. You don't have to say profound words for his last breaths. Just your presence is usually enough for people.

Another tip would be to be in the room with your grandfather AND someone else who is better/more experienced with these things. Let them lead the conversation and chime in when you feel necessary.

If you love your grandfather, let him know when you do go to leave."
