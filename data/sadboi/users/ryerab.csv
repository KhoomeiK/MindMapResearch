schizophrenia,ffs93qw,t3_eute1g,1580176155.0,From psyhcodynamic point of view Voices are defenses. In away there is a conflict of wanting to connect but wanting to isolate. The voice gives you that wish but at the same time prevents you from interacting in reality
MentalHealthPH,ffq3chg,t3_eukqsc,1580118148.0,I think if u call your doctors clinic they will inform the doctor who could advise you what to do next. I wont advise stoppig or startig meds w/o confirming with ur doctor first. Just expalin to them that the enxt available schedule is too far away so they would understand why ur asking. Sometime they may even refer you to another doctor while they are not available

selfharm,ffebpss,t1_ffe3gjs,1579842358.0,"Let  me put that into context then. Simpler than getting caught in school brought/reported to a guidance counselor, referred to a psychiatry just for clearance of being fit to continue . Simpler than worrying your friends and family. Leave the razor, dont buy it, dont even try to borrow one, leave all sharp objects to ur family. You cam if you try."
selfharm,ffe3gjs,t3_esz0fc,1579835704.0,Simple analogy. If you want to lose weight dont surround urself with food. With self harm thoughts dont surround ur self with triggers such as razor. In asense your takig a diet from self harming

Benzodiazepine are anti anxiety but their also antiseizures, can also be used for acute problems for sleep and withdrawals from alcohol. But they dont call it anti alcohol do they?

Have a genuine talk with your doctor and how your meds works. Stop assuming and stary asking"

Biologically anxiety or depression effects the hippocampus which is bassicaly involved in short memory
MentalHealthPH,fdur14c,t3_cz9idx,1578737645.0,If you are going to mention the name of your doctors you criticized instead being respectful and mention annonymously then i suggest you also post your real name. At least give the other party a chance to defend themselves. If you truly believe what you have criticized and can defend it with evidence then you should have no problem with that.
