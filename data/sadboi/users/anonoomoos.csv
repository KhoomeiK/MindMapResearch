I have an ED and I know the people I've told have a hard time with knowing what to do. What has helped me is if people don't directly ask about it or offer advice right away. Just providing a space for her to talk and then really just listening is a good start. It's a hard topic to talk about and sometimes approaching with just saying you want to hear what she's going through is a good way to get her to open up. And later maybe suggesting she get professional help (her choice, not like forceful saying she needs help). It's helped me a lot."

relationships,f8pqwx2,t3_e1g2u8,1574705879.0,"I'm actually on the other side of the coin, but this story sounds just like us. I'm F28 and my partner is M31. We have been together for 12 years now and let me tell you, this is a very important topic. It's been our biggest issue the whole relationship. Sex is a need, just like feeling secure, loved, hungry, etc. And everyone is on a different level. Like you stated, he just needs it less than you, and both are correct for the respective person. Communication is going to be a big element for this, at least it is for us. Like being REALLY honest with one another and not shaming each other for who may need more or less sex, and in what way. I will say at a base level, having these different levels of sex needs may be an issue later down the line, and if it is it will probably be hard. But we've lasted 12 years and are in a happy relationship (of course still growing and learning and going thru hard shit) and communication and hearing each other's needs has vastly improved our relationship. Be honest about your needs, and allow him to feel heard about his. And make an actionable plan from there about how to meet those needs is what I would recommend. Good luck guys!"

AnorexiaNervosa,f8d6so4,t1_f8d52w5,1574480001.0,"Yeah, it's honestly hard to really believe what I look like because I think my mood changes my perception of myself. And I know bodies change throughout the day, but it can be like one second I'm looking at myself and if it's been a ""good"" day and I think I look alright, and then I'll eat something and be ""bad"" and all of a sudden I can't stand how I look."
AnorexiaNervosa,f8899ol,t1_f84mb68,1574350799.0,"Yes, I definitely felt that. And it's like even people who see you often aren't aware how unhealthily fast that stuff happens. And they just say ""oh you look good"" and things like that and it kinda stokes the fire. The bad comments made you want to lose all the weight and the good ones make you want to lose even more."
AnorexiaNervosa,f81j7c7,t1_f816tbl,1574169159.0,"Wow, I relate to this a lot! I don't think I have a metabolic condition, but I have definitely always just been bigger than my siblings. Taller, wider, bigger bone structure. We could eat the same and my two younger sisters would always be smaller. And then people would make comments about how ""no offense, but I was just bigger"" so after multiple comments and feelings about that I started eating way less and working out all the time. Years later it turned Into a terrible special where I would be ""good"" and basically not eat and work out all the time, or ""bad"" where I would binge like there was no tomorrow and feel guilty and cry. I think it probably messed with my body and metabolism and so now it's all out of whack. 

It's good to hear that you don't hate yourself, that can def be a contributing factor to ED. And I can def understand how you'd feel as you do, but from an outside perspective, I know you're not too chubby to be loved! Everyone deserves love, and even if some people don't believe you or acknowledge your problems, that doesn't mean it isn't happening and that you don't deserve help. It's hard to get out of that mindset though, I can speak to that. Have you ever reached out for help, like a therapist?"
AnorexiaNervosa,f80h2pn,t1_f803z3r,1574128877.0,"Aw man, that sounds rough. But I can def relate, I guess I'll use anything that gets my mind off of it these days.

I haven't technically been diagnosed, but I just recently got help and we are going through some steps to figure out exactly what's going on and find a way to help. The first step is wanting to change, and then acting on that. There are reasons we get this way, and in some deep ruts, but we can also get out of them.
