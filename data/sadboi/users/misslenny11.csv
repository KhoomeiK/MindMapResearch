I obsess about them, I get extremely emotional to the point of not being able to do life, then there is either a point where I start hating them or I just realise it is not worth caring about them anymore. After that I am just indifferent. 

So I was wondering does it happen like this to everyone or is it more of a light switch kind of thing?"

If I look at my own life, this is the part that makes me saddest. That I know I have the intelligence to be successful. I know this because there have been points where I have been mentally stable for a period of time, and in those times I have used my intelligence/knowledge and done well.

When I told my grandfather that I would not be joining, because my values don't align with theirs, he went on a on a very loud rant.

Of course now I look at it again, I realise that area should really be the priority anyway.
