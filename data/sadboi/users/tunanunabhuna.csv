With how things are looking financially in the future it might be the best thing to take a degree in something that has more of a guaranteed income so that you can keep yourself afloat and have acting as your backup or your hobby. That way you can keep your toes dipped in to that world.

I don't think it's silly for you to only want to do acting and your riends are probably just thinking of the harsh reality that it is hard to get a steady income from that. But so many people do do it and have some sort of success from it.

I just think for what is happening in the world it might be best to have acting ad your hobby until its more financially feasible for you to lean in to it more."

I think what's important is to find someone at your school that you can talk to and say you don't want your mum involved. As for things at home, can you not talk to your mum about that? If not there's some lines you can call or websites where you can chat to people. Look on mental health charity websites in your country and there will be links and numbers you can discuss this with.

You aren't alone and having the confidence to talk to people on the Internet about it is the first step. I hope this helps a little and that you will be able to find someone to talk to. I really recommend online chats with people trained to help as well as numbers to call as well."
