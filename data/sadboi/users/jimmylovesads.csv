- A quirky older office woman, possibly receptionist or HR
- Weird names for their meeting rooms usually with an ongoing theme
- A guy in strategy (maybe data) who no one really understands what he does but management loves him
- A working class man who runs the studio, hates management but gets the work done
- A sassy female creative who the guys drool over but she hates men
- A shy talented IT guy who people ignore in the hallway
- A traffic manager who is like an office bulldog

Yeah that pretty much sums it up."

I am sure you guys are good folks but there's already quite a bit of agency talent here."

advertising,fjv1mkc,t1_fjuuxx1,1583622359.0,"It's all good to have different views, I respect that. Your agency should be able to create work for any spec provided to them. What they can't do is what you mention around suggesting media placements beyond this or knowing anything about media. That is a media agency job, or if your team is so well versed its your job to do this."
advertising,fjuo4e2,t1_fjs5xqz,1583618524.0,"Creative agencies don't know anything about digital channel placements. They just know how to develop creative to the specs that are given to them. They will argue that they know social media buying but they are not versed in this space. A media agency would be, and could develop a media strategy and pass on the specs to the creative agency. Thats how I would see it working. Things may be managed differently in your industry/country."

SebDerm,fjloch5,t1_fjl8orl,1583450776.0,Sorry to hear. Sounds like you were onto a good thing though?
SebDerm,fjlkymh,t1_fjld0dz,1583448658.0,I was skeptical of it too. I work in marketing by trade so this stuff is usually BS. But the stuff works for me so I believe some kind of skin doctor would have said its good.
