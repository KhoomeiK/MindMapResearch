I‚Äôve heard some interesting stories over the past 5 years. I‚Äôve seen the happily married couples and I‚Äôve seen the miserable ‚Äúputting on an act‚Äù couples. 

I‚Äôve seen ‚Äúdamage control‚Äù or ‚Äúapology‚Äù jewelry/designer brands on the wives who don‚Äôt work after husbands are MIA for the weekend. 

Lots of drugs and alcohol are involved as well. 

So to answer your question, I don‚Äôt think money can buy happiness... I‚Äôve seen a lot of depressed millionaires/billionaires who drive their fancy range rovers but drink themselves into a puddle most nights.. But I guess it can help lol"
