That if I had to live in it for one month how would I put things. If I had 1000 dollars how would I make it my home. I tend to do that with rooms, places ect. It's calming. Bathrooms just seem like the only place you can walk into and strangers will not go. Where you can be silent. Read, hide. It makes me wish I had a little cubby hole space to be my Narnia.

Sometimes my anxiety changes too just by shutting a door. It's like a shift in the atmosphere where it's my universe for that moment."

Tourettes,fq8fg3n,t1_fq8e3nr,1589164998.0,"Severe motor to the point of being unable to properly move accompanied by hitting/smacking/scratching self. Vocal can be bad at times, mostly sounds and repetitious words or phrases. Sometimes it feels like I'm moving when I'm sitting perfectly still. If I fight off my tics ( like for a moment in public. ) in any way they build like I'm coiling a rubber band then explode after.

Rolling and wrenching wrists/fingers locking up. It's full body at it's peak. I mentioned in another post how it can feel like a conscious seizure at times. Even down to my eyes vibrating and not wanting to focus on anything.

A lot of my issue at the moment is damage it's done from fingertips to elbows over the years. I've had it all going on since I was around 8. My family just called it embarrassing and told me to stop it. I've just as of two years ago started trying to get help finally."

My therapist still argues with me when I fight it, she keeps pointing out that *trauma is trauma.* Those who suffer from it are individual cases. No two people process the trauma the same. So someone who I feel deserves it, their mental pain and suffering? She compares to my abusive childhood/adult hood ect  with all the other things I've had happen to me and how I am still handling it all.

Truthfully it makes me feel horrible it being on paper I have it. Just because I still deal with hell and had it growing up the fact I am alive even though I'm a broken shell of a person? I'm still breathing, walking and can feed myself. I don't care how abusive mentally/physically/emotionally I had/have it to this day. Still makes me feel like garbage that it's listed."

I've been raped and still she/her parents hurt me more. So I understand that and also how narcissistic it sounds because it is just that.

Tourettes,fpsev0m,t3_gf894w,1588872291.0,"I do this. Sometimes as weird as it sounds? Words feel good saying them. Or just some phrase gets stuck because my mouth likes how it moves ect. Causes me to say them sometimes upwards of 100 times over the course of a few minutes.

Also makes my tics display worse and I end up tapping my hands on things all around me including myself along with it.

If I stutter the word though, the process changes. Cause sometimes again as weird as it sounds, my brain gets caught on a tick while talking and I just go haywire for a moment and extend words and sounds while my body locks up in the tic.

Just giving support and some of what happens to me so you know the weirdness hits me too, same as the being glad I'm not around anyone when it happens. Sometimes they catch the tail end of it though."

But those few we trust with things that betray and damage it just. . . it makes us recoil enough we start doubting things. I admit after that all happened I went over to where I see my therapist and seen someone ( mine was in session at the time no problem at all. ) And she did what I needed and got me word vomiting all my frustrations to someone I'd never met before. (since she was just a stand in for that time.) I slid back in my shell so much that I swore I would just keep handling it myself. But I can't, I tried and it's just getting to me more and more as the years go on. I've read about people *'growing out of it'* years ago. And I was like, no. Those who have it, we have it. We all have a mutual understanding that others without it don't understand. 

We can describe it to 100 doctors and none will understand the pain or distress it gives us from minute to minute. I'm sorry you have the trouble you do, I've scared myself before that my neck cranking tick is going to make me snap it. Had to look up that I can't just twist it and do it that easy which helped me in the long run. This nerve damage in my arms though. My mind goes dark places I get so exhausted. Maybe the comment above where it was added about the Discord server would help you too! Just wanted to mention that. Thank you for this, it helps me so much."
Tourettes,fpscrnk,t1_fprix5i,1588871281.0,"I get so much what you mean about being afraid to feel things. Sometimes I get so frustrated I seem mad or short with people and I try to explain it's not them it's me trying to handle myself. Honestly? It's me being mad at my body all over again. I got thinking about things and it effects me enough I can't pick up or hold things at times. It's like eating, your body refuses to do movements it does not want at times.

 You can't pick up a drink/open one, or you can't lift a food item or means to eat it with until your body and brain okay it. And you suffer for it. I can hear the joints in my hands when they pop and crack after I argue with myself to calm down and the jerking, wrist/arm/ect rolling and twitching things happen. 

It takes away a persons confidence. I need to see someone in neuro soon, you're right. I oddly never thought about there being one that would take on and handle people with it! Thank you so much for pointing that out, because when I went to mine I expected some wacky nerve testing or looking at my brain. Something, anything other than what I was met with. I'll check out that server too!!! You really did help."
