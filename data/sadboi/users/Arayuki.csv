I remember I rolled past his wide halberd sweep only to stand on my feet and take his kick full force in the shield. My stats were good so he didn't break my guard with my shield, but instead my character went sliding backwards across the entire arena on my feet l. I was blown away, it was like something out of an anime and I INSTANTLY got so hyped for the rest of the fight. In my head I was like-

I got to a point where I was in the top 2 on my team every game and made it to G5 pretty quickly. Now I'm at the bottom almost constantly unless I get that lucky game where I'm totally in the zone. I'm just happy to see how well some of these people have mastered this game. It makes me regret ever putting it down for awhile, but I can't help that now.

I had one friend that I finally opened up about all my trauma, because he knew something was wrong... but once I started getting into the crazy stuff he just switched the topic out of nowhere. Complete denial. Doesn't even REMEMBER the conversation. He just flipped a switch and it's as if I never mention it. We drifted pretty far apart after that, especially as that was during the 3 years of this prolonged and ridiculous mess of events that traumatized me. New it's been 3-4 years since the traumatic relationship/events stopped and me and that friend don't talk anymore. I've finally told my mom about all of it after so many years. My wife doesn't like to talk about it, as it involves a pretty big ex girlfriend. But she is extremely supportive of my therapy and all. I've been diagnosed with extreme anxiety and depressive disorder, as well as PTSD. And my therapist later diagnosed me with childhood emotional neglect from my dad just weeks ago as a whole chain of events started between my mom and dad. My mom is an angel. My dad is a narcissistic mess.

I understand nobody believing you. Especially with friends I've had for years trying to understand my recent diagnoses while I've been ""completely normal"" for years. I'm just good at hiding everything and I'm very selective of who knows what about me. All I've learned is that the less who know, the better.

But that doesn't mean I don't have to run out and do errands by myself. I don't talk to or hang out with anyone but my wife. All my focus is on myself, her and me. I used to easily fall in love and emotionally dive head first into relationships. I used to get ignored by girls and I would be obsessive. Now I've found my balance and it's frustrating that now I'm married and trying to focus on healing from a past brutal relationship and am feeling great being in a balanced and loving relationship with my wife, but now that I ignore other women, I can tell that makes the try even harder, which I was used to the exact opposite. It feels like harrassment almost with how audacious some of these women try to come at me and I honestly hate it. I wish there was a way for me to just tell people I want to be left alone. I'm not trying to play hard to get. I'm trying to protect myself and my own marriage.

The cop was being a dick and I know I was in the wrong but I was so wound up by that point and he was about to search my car for anything illicit because i seemed like i was ""hiding something."" And it took every nerve in my body to try and calmly say ""I've get ultra severe anxiety and PTSD, and now I'm super late for work and I'm getting a ticket from you right now, I'm just really not in a good head space"" and he was just kinda like ""huh"" and then wrote on my ticket that I was going 10 MPH less than I actually was over the speed limit. (It was originally 25 miles over) and yeah. That barely helped me make it the rest of the way to work. Everybody just seemed to step out of my way and not want to look at me once I got there. It just made it all worse."
ptsd,ersxqj2,t3_c3rcdm,1561226978.0,I relate to this one very very much.. Road rage is a whole other story when you have this mindset.
ptsd,erqsty3,t3_c34b7x,1561151190.0,"Yeah, I relate to this for sure. I never reached the point of attempting suicide but I've been in some dark places. I have a counselor I've been going to, and if there is one thing I've learned through it all is that only you can help yourself. Therapists and stuff are there to help but ultimately I feel like we are the ones that works through the thoughts and make ourselves better. Use the aids you have when you can get them. But if there's one person that's ever been able to truly help me calm down my own anxiety force myself to get back to and try again, it's me. 

When you're having an anxiety attack, everyone tries to tell you take a deep breathe, or think happy thoughts or whatever advice they give. But ultimately YOU take that deep breathe, or clear your head, or whatever it is you gotta do.

I know when I've been rejected and turned down after I thought I could trust people. Or suddenly when people can't handle my anxiety or depression anymore, I know that just kicks my PTSD into overdrive and I just have to survive and suddenly everyone is my enemy and I have to protect myself and hide or lash out. It's scary. Its exhausting and your nerves just start to singe on the ends with the constant adrenaline.

I'm glad you've come to this thread. I've been met with warm welcomes and more with the few posts I've made here and it's probably been one of the best things I've done for myself. Just to read and know that other people feel the same, even if I never meet them face to face, makes all th difference. Jus th proof I'm not alone."

ptsd,erb3zam,t1_eraxqpu,1560660907.0,"Precisely. It's all so overdone and phobic of opposites. Because the other side can have its extremes too. Like one time I had a gay friend get mad because I straight, not that they liked me, but apparently just being straight was offensive to their status as gay and I just don't get it. To become so extreme in a direction and then get mad at everybody else for not jumping on your bandwagon is pretty immature. If you have to be followed and supported to do your own thing or to be different and still feel good about being you? I think that's more attention whoring than actually being unique."
ptsd,erau66h,t1_erat733,1560653014.0,"Yeah my current job forbids cannabis and stuff in my system so I don't like to risk it. But it is a very physically strenuous job so I do feel the most distracted while I'm at work. 

I do all kinds of feminist shit and it's funny because certain people think it's funny and others are just blown away. One of the supervisors at my job is a lesbian and she's got full sleeves of tattoos and stuff. Wears no make up but has super long brown hair. Even though we rarely talk I feel like she's been the most supportive of me being who I am even when she has no idea my mental struggles. While as my lead in my department is an ex football player country boy who Shamed me for wearing skinny Jean's when I first started working there. 

I'm a very expressive person.  I dye my hair and wear crazy clothes and I don't really do it for attention, its honestly just to express how I'm feeling legitimately because I cannot put words together to even say if I'm having a good day or not. A picture speaker a thousand words and honestly those thousand words of my appearance to a hell of a lot better of a job than my mouth has ever managed to pull off. 

When I think of feminism and stuff, I think of true equality. If a dude wants to be a stay at home dad while the mom works, then that's fine. For the first 2 years of mine and my wifes relationship she made more money than me, yet I had a way more labouring job. I didn't see a problem. Honestly in my mind, if both parties can use their strengths, whether creative minds and legit physical strength combined, and achieve a common goal efficiently? Then that's great. I take everybody on at face value. If you tell me you can sing soprano better than that other girl while she's realistically has a voice for singing bass, then that's great. Its unique and only you can do you the best. If my significant other was a power lifter and I baked cookies as side hobby and needed her to open my jar of pickles for me, who cares. Lol. True equality is equal no matter how you cut it. That's just science."

The whole feminist movement thing confuses me even more when people are already putting me down as evil and animalistic and not rationally minded because I'm a man driven by my dick and I should learn to get in touch with my emotions, but at the same time they throw me a double standard that I got to be as solid as a rock and toughen up because I'm they man and I'm not supposed to be tender and passionate and a teddy bear. I get so much disgust and stuff because I have Crohns disease and Celiacs disease. I'm such a sensitive eater that its ridiculous. 

Just to get assumed you might be gay or something because you can't eat so many different things and everyone assumes it's a choice before considering I might have several underlying health issues. It's frustrating because I used to not want to be sober at all. I drank a lot, and a lot of caffeine and I smoked a lot of cigarettes. And suddenly I have to quick smoking and drinking and everything else because my crohns and celiacs forbid it, or else i could have some serious digestive issues.

Even with all my traumas I don't get to be special or unique. And I'm not trying to put down any body else or their own issues by saying that.
