I’m 24/F from the US and also into all of the above. I shoot film as well. 120 & 35. I love Tim and Eric & Nathan For You and a lot of the music you mentioned.

If you want to talk, let me know! x"

analog,et6kenj,t1_et6hytm,1562514444.0,"Exactly. I will say the -only- edit I made was that I had to “dehaze” it a bit on Lightroom. The camera itself is already hazy but it ended up really diminishing the color when I scanned it. It was a quick fix, though."

ADHD,erzufme,t3_c52d7w,1561452145.0,"One would be applying to jobs, because I’m absolutely terrified of the interviewing process and dread it because of my low-self esteem and motivation.

Another is following up with people. I will make plans with someone, and never follow up to execute said plan. This has been an issue for me in getting jobs too. Sometimes I’ll have an interview that seemed good, and then I don’t hear from them, and then I never follow up about it because I’m afraid.

The last one I can think of would be submitting forms on time. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been instructed to submit paperwork and I’ve either forgotten about it, misplaced it, or just didn’t want to do it. That was always an issue when I was in school.

Update - one more - fixing my car. I’ve had issues with it and have heard it making strange sounds but have neglected to do anything about it. Hope it doesn’t spontaneously combust one day!"

AskWomen,erity2j,t3_c286xr,1560907163.0,"My last ex had some deeply rooted “mommy issues”. He was very unhygienic and would only shower if I asked or ordered him to do so. He had a poor diet of mostly sugar, processed junk and carbs. I used to tell him he ate like he was a kid at a birthday party. He never cleaned, either, which became a huge issue as we were living together and I would always have to cook dinner, clean all the dishes - in addition to the entirety of the apartment. 

After I left him, months later we became friends. I went over to his new place and shockingly, it was very organized. Not perfect - but he had definitely remembered some of the things I told him. I looked in his fridge and was surprised to see actual fruits! As for the hygiene - that was still questionable.

Maybe he had to be on his own to develop some good habits, and my presence and nagging didn’t help. It could also be that he just matured a bit. I’m not sure. I’m just glad to see that I made some sort of impact and that he was able to take a little bit better care of himself."
