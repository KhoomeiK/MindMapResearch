EatingDisorders,fotxoi6,t1_foqceta,1588069818.0,"Everyone's issues are unique to their story so yours will likely differ from mine but here are two books that I found useful:

* [""Conquering Shame and Codependency: 8 Steps to Freeing the True You"" by Darlene Lancer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18406569-conquering-shame-and-codependency#)
* [""The Drama of the Gifted Child: The Search for the True Self"" by Alice Miller](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4887.The_Drama_of_the_Gifted_Child?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=AkbAk11yz3&rank=1)

The TLDR is:

* Codependents have three identities: 1) true self  (usually suppressed or hidden),  2) ideal self, 3) devalued self, which is shaped by their upbringing
* Parents mirror back to their children what they didn't get in their childhood, the child in return may interpret this through (sometimes suppressed) emotions, which then reflects in their adult life (and which they will also pass to their children leading to inter-generational trauma).
* Babies learn from their parents facial expressions, it's sort of a ""brain transfer"" from parent to child. So, to a certain extent, we also inherit from a very young age our parents brains.
* More in [Tim Ferris' podcast interview of Gabor Maté](https://youtu.be/H9B5mYfBPlY).

How this reflects in my case:

* I have a good (though cold) relationship with mother. She has trouble showing emotions.
* My mother as a child exhibited many of the same behaviors as I did: thumb sucking, getting bored easily, not having enough loving touch from mother.
* Because of the latter, my mother tried to give me all the love and touching she could. As a child I was in her arms all the time. Yet I realized the that the only emotion I've ever *felt* from her is anxiety (manifested in her voice).
* So despite all of my mother's efforts to change things, she wan't able to make me feel  loved.
* This is also what I saw in my MDMA-assisted therapy session (compassionate use): when I was a baby, my mother loved with all her heart but she couldn't *show* it to me because she didn't know how to.
* As a result I've had trouble feeling safe and soothed all my life (ref. [this article](https://www.edcatalogue.com/hidden-trauma-eating-disorders/)), which is making it hard for me to have self-confidence and detach from her."
EatingDisorders,fotvugn,t3_g8xug0,1588067956.0,"Thanks everyone for your kind words, useful advice, and touched that it may have helped some of you gain insight (I'm the author of this post).

If it can help, here’s my current morning routine to try be more in touch with myself:

* **Breathe** (to activate the parasympathetic nervous system, i.e. calm oneself): 4s breath in, 7s hold, 8s out, do this 4 times
* **Mindful stretching and/or yoga** for 10-30 min
* **Meditation** 10 min (I use the Waking up app, there’s a great 50 day learning to mediate course plus tons of content)
* **Cold shower** (Wim Hof method)
* **Coffee with “morning pages”** where I have a conversation with my brain for 25 min, it generally yields interesting insights (inspired from [this podcast](https://howtofail.podbean.com/e/how-to-fail-m-gawdat-c19/))

Sometimes I don’t have time to do it all and that’s ok, will shorten parts and skip the part after the shower. Better done than perfect :).

Due to my lack of progress with classic therapy, I’m currently undergoing psychedelic-assisted therapy (legally). Will continue to report back here what I learn about finding one’s feelings. As for insights, I’m sharing these in a [blog](https://ayanha.substack.com/) as there are just so many!"
Dissociation,fnrtlib,t3_g1umq7,1587201068.0,"\+1 to we’re really out here living the exact same life...  I've had an eating disorder (anorexia when emotionally stressed, bulimia when numb/bored) for 20+ years. The food cravings feel like an addiction, as if my brain is hijacked. According to Gabor Maté (in his book [In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts](https://www.amazon.com/Realm-Hungry-Ghosts-Encounters-Addiction/dp/155643880X) p.232), the senses in the mouth play a big role in emotional soothing, eating disorders are usually a sign of (childhood) emotional distress.

We're all different but this may resonate with you:

I'm undergoing substance-assisted (also known as psychedelic) therapy for my ED (because nothing else has worked). According to my therapist I dissociate, which is linked to maladaptive attachment disorder. What's come out of my MDMA therapy session is that when I get bored there's a void that leaves room for emotional distress to surface (ref. Gabor Maté) => that feeling would be too intense so I dissociate by binge eating => purge => feel crap => blame self => dissociate etc.... I've captured a first version of my analysis in this blog post ""[Perception: The Power of Our Beliefs](https://ayanha.substack.com/p/perception-the-power-of-our-beliefs)."" I've since evolved the framework shared in that post to include self-actualization/identity and the relationship to my mother (since ED generally stem from that, blog post coming shortly). There's so much more to say, which is why I'm blogging, but I'll leave it at that for now.

Tips received to deal with this dissociation:

* Spend time on activities (e.g. in my case boredom) that lead to dissociation, in the process be mindful and just before dissociating try feel that emotion (it can be very strong so you may want to work with a therapist), then ground
* Do EMDR to de-sensitize
* Explore and reflect on ""struggle"" vs. ""let go"" scenarios in your life

PsychedelicTherapy,fmj2y8r,t3_fusqud,1586121968.0,"Have you considered working with a guide during your session? A choice of words in music, a hand to hold, or merely knowing that there's someone there form you may create the ""safe space"" you need to let go.

Also, my first mdma session brought clarity more than it brought new insights; it’s as if an impressionist painting got turned into a renaissance one. The insights came from integration after and my therapist (also my guide) helped deepen that."
EatingDisorders,fmixydv,t3_fuyyqg,1586119155.0,"Thank you for having the courage to post this. We are here for you. You must feel exhausted and a great sense of shame for carrying that secret. It took me more than twenty years to admit to anyone.

There's so much I'd like to tell you that I don't know where to start. It'd be easy to tell you do X or Y but we all experience life differently and there's no cookie cutter solution.

What I can say is yes, get a nutritionist and a therapist. But be aware, it can take time to find one that you trust and that feel in-tune with. So don't despair. For the nutritionist I found it helpful to have someone who'd had ED and could empathize with me. For the therapist.... well it took 20 years to find a good one. I also, wasn't ready to deal with my deeper pains until now; to accept that the source of my 'issues' was 'me' and that 'hacking' my weight wouldn't solve them.  You may want to explore different types of therapies from CBT to psychoanalysis or more alternative ones like IFS, EMDR, and others presented in the book ""The Body Keeps the Score."""
investing,fmh1lk6,t3_fur5f1,1586063869.0,ok thanks wasn't sure as search results yielded little on the topic
Psychedelics,fm94p8u,t3_fsy4ae,1585861668.0,Confusing indeed. Sometimes being okay to not have closure is the best way forward. Who knows what is happening in their life... sounds like they didn’t want to hurt you so it may have nothing to do with you?
mdmatherapy,fm7onp4,t3_ftauw5,1585833246.0,"You may want to work with an [integration therapist](https://integration.maps.org). It can be helpful to have someone ask questions that you may not be asking yourself because they're seeing things from a different perspective. This opened up a lot of new angles for me.

EatingDisorders,fm7nrdq,t3_ftjncg,1585832584.0,"It's hard living with an anorexic; you want to help and yet you must feel powerless at times. The best thing you can do is be there for them. Show compassion, acceptance, and empathy. The hardest thing with anorexia is the feeling of isolation. I have memories of people telling me I was too thin, that they were concerned about me and wanted to help. But it didn't resonate. I was seeing my body differently. I didn't want their help. All I wanted was a friend who would not judge me and just be there."
Psychedelics,fm7mypg,t3_fsy4ae,1585831981.0,"Life is composed of beliefs. Our perception of the world is shaped by these and the stories we tell ourselves. So while you may be seeing things from one perspective  that person may be seeing the ""same"" relationship with a different lens shaped by their beliefs. It's not to imply that one is better than the other nor to justify what appears to be a very abrupt way of communicating but it may just be that you're seeing your friendship differently. Generally what we don't like in others is something we don't like in ourselves but won't admit to oneself.  Is there something you can learn about yourself in this experience? And/or maybe it's for that friend to learn something from it all :)"
