Honestly, SBMM on Switch, console and PC is different. 

When I play on the Switch no-one really edits, its like a sweat move to edit a window for me. 

Then I jump on controller on PC and first match I'm getting beamed as I land, rushed within 30 seconds of a match starting and double edit on for the kill.
