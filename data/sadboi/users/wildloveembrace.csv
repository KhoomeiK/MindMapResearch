BPD,fivhxxk,t1_fivgrsg,1582760637.0,"When you say that with your established preferences you feel a sort of "" wrong inside "". 
I do too. Or that sometimes I can't relate at all.
Knowing what enmeshment trauma is really about , it makes sense though. That we weren't allowed to have preferences, to like something that ""wasn't allowed"" and we were deemed wrong/inappropriate for liking it or even the thing itself is deemed as "" should not like"" and so we developed a complete and utter absence of sense of self and when we do find some preferences/likes and dislikes it feels * wrong *. But that wrong message is what comes with the enmeshment itself. ( ie It is wrong to have your own preferences ).
So keep going and don't beat yourself up about it. Allow for your preferences to change, it's no big deal. they don't define you entirely, just the having of them gives a sense of self and in time it'll give more and more clarity and strong likes and preferences will start appearing and won't go away anymore little by little one by one and your identity starts existing again. Start with little steps, keep a journal of what your likes/preferences are about anything it doesn't matter what it is. And then the next day turn the page and do the same. And the next day the same and so on. That's your only work regarding enmeshment. As you keep at it your sense of self will start stabilizing bit by bit. It also helps with BPD I dare say. I haven't trialed this idea long enough to assess it, but on paper it does make sense that having a clear sense of self will give more balance in general, or at the very least more capacity and energy to tackle the other issues."

It's hard to process. Go say to a traumatized kid that they're bad because of it and should feel like shit and get over it. Of course it will backfire.

That is, take the abandonment trauma out of the picture and what you're left with is a healthy human being who is indeed more empathetic than the general population. Place them in a crude, invalidating environment and they develop BPD.
And the same can be told about many ""disorders"".
I reject the term ""disorder"" because it implies there's something inherent *wrong* in me at my core. 
And that's not true because I wasn't born with BPD, it developed due to trauma and circumstances.

BPD is the coping mechanism for someone who is highly sensitive and has been invalidated, or to word it in a better way.

So maybe it's better worded to say the essence genuine essence of it is genuinely understanding others deeper, but that it becomes problematic when it becomes a disorder due to being gaslighted a lot in childhood, and repressing it in ourselves. I feel there's two sides to this coin, not only one.

Also, I found, a way to know for sure if it's my BPD or not is to ask ourselves "" Do I agree with this?"". For example if we have an instant inner reaction about someone doing 
something, do we agree with our knee jerk reaction? If done right there on the spot it helps discern what is a ""trigger"" and what is ""being opposed to an injustice being made"". And then ask ourselves "" What is the most pleasant way for me to express this to them?"""
BPD,fiuf3l0,t1_fiudtyf,1582740193.0,"Jesus Duck, you got an intermittent reinforcement type of relationship. Exactly like I did! This is the video that shed light on what was going on for me, maybe you can relate too? ( https://youtu.be/M_lakRMIA7Q )

Also it's about time we stop using our BPD as an excuse for others' poor manners.
I don't know your boyfriend, how you guys fell inlove, but from what you said here I know for sure that you don't feel he is being reasonable at all and afterall, to know that a relationship is right or not for you, isn't that all that you nee? You don't feel he's being reasonable.

Now beyond my ""objective good-will educated opinion"" I'll present you the opinion of the other part of me.
My other opinion is that YES , he's being unreasonable, NO it's not your BPD rather your BPD is being used against you, and C) you're in an intermittent reinforcement relationship, one of the most toxic. 

You should consider the possibility that he may be a narcissist or at the very very least has BPD himself and needs someone to validate him continuously and it just comes out in the form of anger and disapproval from him.
My money is on he's a narcissist. That's actually the worst type of match for us with BPD. 
Please seriously consider, what it is you truly want in a relationship and how much of that is present in the relationship you have now. He is NOT the only way to have those needs met.

Also, controlling how your girlfriend dresses and diminish her worth for it is not what's considered normal in relationships.
You being the only one to move towards him is NOT considered a normal relationship.
The partner gaslighting your reasons for doing something that you like doing, is NOT considered a normal relationship.

But you know it's not.The fact that he's loving with you sometimes it's what makes it so hard to put part of the responsibility on him too. That's exactly what intermittent reinforcement does to a person. I am sure you're almost fed up with it though ðŸ˜…"

But keeping calm in mind, and I know it's hard, maybe telling him openly why you chose the coat and that you're hurt he didn't appreciated the effort you made to go his way maybe maybe could open up a crack in his wall.

That is not to say we shouldn't take a bit of responsibility for our words and actions, of course we do but we also have to remember we do it from a place of being traumatized and scared inside.

About how to approach the subject with your boyfriend , how do you feel it would be the most comfortable way for you? Through messaging , a letter , email? I think it's harder for us to sit down and have a calm and clear face to face conversation when the other person is so closed to understanding as he is, so maybe a more indirect approach would help. 

Also, you could consider to just say "" I love you baby but I love the pants too because they make me feel glorious.

So having these two traumas together makes it so that it's so hard to get out of the one or the other. I feel, what is truly needed in a scenario like ours is patience, which if you're like me you probably feel that you have no time for patience lol.
"" I've suffered enough , I'm sick, I want all this to get better already "" and then we rush to some way of feeling better , then when it doesn't produce the fast results we expected we feel even more defeat, throw tantrums , exhaust ourselves and then we wait. Soon after , we start feeling better, have a little bit more energy and again we find the next ""miraculous"" thing which will *fix* us, but sadly it keeps repeating over and over and it exasperates me more and more.

But I found the thing that helps the most is to insist to give myself a break. That I won't get out overnight and ""falling"" is ok because what matters is not ""not to fall"" but to keep on keep on going slowly, gently and with patience. 

For me it's helping to write what my own preferences are. Such as: I like this type of ice cream, I prefer these types of sports etc etc. It's extremely hard for me to even find what I actually like and what I don't though because I am so ready to mold myself into whatever personality is needed to get love from the next person I meet. It's slowish progress in a way, but awareness helps. Stay strong"
BPD,fiu2q9m,t1_fiu2ehp,1582734137.0,"I don't know if it applies to you, it may be. This is what made me personally realize that I had enmeshment trauma and it explained how I felt whilst interacting with others and why. Hope it helps you too.

BPD,fiu2ehp,t3_f9uhjs,1582733980.0,"Ahhhhh, I know. Seems enmeshment is actually intertwined with BPD.

The way I'd describe enmeshment is, I feel myself being absorbed by the other as soon as they enter the room I feel I have to cater to their own needs, to what makes them feel good and totally inexplicably and absolutely lose contact with my sense of self, with my needs and wants. Like literally I got no friggin clue what my needs are, my preferences and wants are at all.
When the person leaves, my sense of identity slowly starts coming back and I feel better.
For those of us who have enmeshment, to connect with others means to lose ourselves and to disconnect from others means loneliness and isolation. It's a tight fit, but awareness of what's going is the first step."
BPD,fiu1zvy,t3_f9ch7m,1582733784.0,"It helps me to meditate for 15 min, on my breath in and out. Thoughts come, it's ok, I redirect my attention to my breathing and I keep doing that gently for 15 minutes or so."
BPD,fiu1pcm,t1_fiu17xs,1582733643.0,"Also, after the pants comes the make up or the shoes. And after that comes the x and y and z. There's no end. If you have BPD, maintaining as much of what personally defines YOU as YOU is of utmost importance. If you like sport tight pants, stand your ground and say "" I like sport tight pants because it makes me feel this and this and this. Don't ask me to change and remove something that I like that is innocuous, it's mean and unfair and if your loving me depends on me wearing or not wearing those pants then we need to sit down and have a serious conversation about our relationship, because whats gonna be after the sporty pants?""

Loving is NOT controlling, neither self sacrificing. I fear if he has a self esteem issue, after you comply with the pants something else will pop up and then something else and so on without an end. Because by complying with his own selfish request , the core issue is not being resolved."
BPD,fiu17xs,t1_fiu0t6j,1582733398.0,"Of course his wish is egocentric too, lol.
What he's really saying, as I see it, is: "" Stop being so selfish and doing what YOU want, be less selfish and do what I selfishly want"".

He may be in denial but the argument is clear as daylight."
BPD,fitvp7b,t1_fituuz9,1582730405.0,"and thinking about it, it could be true. maybe our disorder is a disorder just because almost no one is truly authentic and genuine. and I find that to be the case for real.

but then again, being authentic and genuine is a truly scary thing and does require quite the bravery to do it, but I just can't forgive them ðŸ˜…

as I read somewhere once "" only a face that lies cannot be truly forgiven"". I find that to be the case to me. I do think, am convinced that all people with BPD could be the ultimate therapists when they'll/we'll manage to have that calmness and sense of self back. Our level of introspection and of looking straight deep into the other's psiche Is a gift not a curse. Sadly , in our society this can be manipulated and abused and this gift turned against oneself with no way to learn/know how to control it and channel it in a healthy way, becomes a draining curse."
BPD,fituuz9,t1_fisojnn,1582729894.0,"I am so sensitive to people's micro face reactions, I am also very convinced I am right and that I can "" see what they really mean and don't have the *balls* to admit to"" ðŸ˜…"
BPD,fituq32,t3_f9m6xi,1582729812.0,"honestly, they could've worded it better. ðŸ˜…"
BPD,fituge4,t1_fitap98,1582729653.0,best ever.
BPD,fittnv1,t3_f9llcb,1582729164.0,"Maybe putting it in the framework that ""they do not do it personally to me, their disagreement is more about their own values and mental conditioning than it is about what I said and did"""
BPD,fittfcw,t1_fittbcl,1582729012.0,"And again I want to put emphasis on ""cold-type"" of people. They always attracted me because they looked calm, composed, as if they had it all figured out. Something that I always wanted for myself."
BPD,fittbcl,t1_fitse33,1582728939.0,"Yeah but I also feel that I don't really find loving and caring matches. Up until now that is that something did shifted in my mind.

I feel like, sadly, we could be more attracted to the cold-type of people which keeps reactivating trauma(s).
To me it always felt like ""if I get HIM to acknowledge me, then I did it. That's it."" And so often ending up in situations where partner's weren't supportive nor understanding, even without me entering a ""segment"". Mostly it seemed that I was the one over reacting , and then after being enraged often felt guilty. We're just so ripe for manipulation that it's scary. We HAVE to have a bit more discernment in our dating lives as long as we do have the BPD cycle active. In my opinion"
BPD,fitszui,t1_fit7gjr,1582728733.0,"Yes. I feel isolated and always ""thirsty"" for ""something"" and nothing is ever enough. I feel that isolation, knowing or feeling that no one can ever reach us is what keeps us stuck in the cycle of BPD.
I always always find a reason as to WHY my partner's"" I love You"" cant be true. The most scary thing is that to my mind, they make sense"
ptsd,fiqc8fj,t1_f0vco6j,1582640935.0,"That's so invalidating. You need around you at least someone who reacts the opposite of that . There's no ""getting over it"". If there's been abuse , it's not just a switch you turn on and off , it's something you live with till you heal. So tell these people to duck off and take your own life in your hands. Always remember that whatever you're feeling IS for a good , valid reason and the way you react about it, is ALWAYS appropriate to how you're feeling. No one who's feeling great does stuff that people who don't feel so great to. It's always appropriate how you react when you have PTSD. They told to get over it because it was annoying them , that should be telling of the lack of empathy and understanding present . Whoever does not validate your feelings , is in fact emotionally abusing you. Stop the vicious cycle."
