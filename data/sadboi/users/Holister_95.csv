relationship_advice,fc56viz,t1_fc56sv7,1577446264.0,I’ve had about 6 sessions of CBT after changing my medication dosage (I have depression) and it was great to be able to talk to another female about all of these issues in more depth. But I don’t want to rely on therapy for the rest of my life I guess.
antidepressants,f9von0s,t3_e746gf,1575675666.0,I know others have already said but 110% eat something before taking it as it usually makes me feel nauseous if I take it on an empty stomach! (On the same dose as you)

depression,exd9y2z,t1_ex9b1sc,1566171050.0,"Thankyou so much for letting me know about your experiences with it! So far I’ve felt pretty okay, only a few days in to be fair, but still! Feeling pretty good. Excited to be back to 10mg. The GP was actually the one who suggested I go down again! 

Wish I could be completely off them too! Good on you!! Thankyou, take care too! :)"

antidepressants,ermho5u,t3_c2se9v,1561023238.0,"Hey, I haven’t been on that high a dose of antidepressant (I’m on citalopram) but I completely relate to the killer headaches and feeling spaced out! I got this horrible like compression feeling around my head like my skull was about to collapse in on itself! Sounds horrible but that’s literally how it felt when on such a low dose! I think I also got racing heart and throat tightness. These symptoms gradually decreased after about a week or two! So I’d give it just a bit more time and see how you feel after! :) if it’s still awful then heck no, go down a dose (carefully)"

antidepressants,erfij40,t1_erfdxjt,1560809215.0,"I have had CBT for 6 weeks and I found that helped so much so I’m thinking of continuing it. But I don’t think it will help me get past some of the annoying side effects of being on a higher dose. I highly recommend therapy! It was amazing to be able to talk to someone who wasn’t there to judge you. 

I’m planning on going to a GP to ask about it all but they never really have enough time to talk through all these side effects. I’m wondering if I should go to a psychologist or something like that instead."
antidepressants,erf9em8,t1_erevr8f,1560803071.0,Thanks for replying btw :)
antidepressants,erf9do7,t1_erevr8f,1560803055.0,"I’d been on 10mg for about 4 or 5 years and due to different circumstances in my life decided to go up another 10mg but I’m not sure it’s doing what I really want it to now. I feel more capable of doing things without overthinking them, but it’s numbed me out so much. I want to be able to do things, but not with hardly any emotions at all!"
antidepressants,erf1gex,t1_ere0r00,1560797776.0,"Ideally I would love to be completely off them altogether but my boyfriend believes I’m doing so much better on them and happier in general! But I honestly feel less happy in myself and hate feeling numb- especially towards him a lot of the time. I know I love him dearly, I just feel like not myself at the moment and it makes it harder to love him more fully. 

We’re discussing it atm, but I think he’s scared I go down to 10mg again. But I think I would like to.

Thanks so much for taking the time to reply :)"
