Fencesitter,fq800j1,t1_fq6cjev,1589155714.0,"Making notes as I was reading: 

-My husband only had 14 days paternity leave as well; the 3rd week when he went back & I was on my own- it was HARD!! His mother came over to help- I was in no mood or state for company though (looking back I wish I would’ve excepted her help more). 

How did you & your husband tag team it? He would come home from work & I would pass the baby to him and grab 3 hrs of sleep (so I had something to get through the night). He also stepped up with housework. 

Especially with you recovering from the surgery? This was also hard- when the baby woke at night, husband would bring him to me to nurse in bed as I had problems even sitting up. When I had to pee, I’d slide/fall out of bed to the bathroom (recovery from c-section is rough-just being honest).

What things do you do to maintain your self identity? I tried to enjoy the things I did before & only made slight adjustments. My life doesn’t revolve around being a mom. 
For example, husband & I always go to renn fest so we are taking the baby with us this year. We are still going to travel but driving & not flying. Etc. I went out to a theater show with my sister for her birthday -just made arrangements with a sitter. 

How do you handle people that shame you for working? I don’t care - my baby is healthy & we spend plenty of time together. I would be miserable being a sahm. I have gotten comments but I never had any issues standing my ground. On the other hand, I lack a shut filter sometimes. Lol

Or not just loving every single breath and coo and poop from your baby? 
Anyone who says they love every second is lying. I didn’t love him til 2 months in- after he started giving me more sleep, & I was put on Zoloft to help even out (I had bad ppd. Despite how it’s portrayed it is not all sadness - mine manifested as anger).

Mom groups will always be obsessive- those ladies didn’t have much personality to begin with and thus enjoy having a label. 

My mom was toxic as well (thus my child will never know her). My dad & I we’re very close- he practically raised me alone. My son is actually named after him.

Have you travelled with your little one yet? 
Not more than an hour car ride so far...this Covid19 is messing with our trip plans though. 

If you wanted to take a 1 week, kid free vacation, do you have anyone you trust to watch your baby? 
My MIL is a saint! She is the real  embodiment of the kitty foreman character from that 70s show. 

Random: Husband & I were thinking of moving to NC too- we are MD/20 mins from DE area.

I feel like there’s only selfish reasons to have a kid? True but beyond that is love; and love the most basic & unselfish reason. 

I think experiencing childhood again with my kid would be fun.
-I cannot wait to teach him things & we are really looking forward to the holidays : )"
Fencesitter,fq5wgkj,t1_fq4vrj0,1589119242.0,"Novel ahead (Brain dump):

Pregnancy was rough- not because of morning sickness but just the aches/pains and I was working. You don’t sleep very well during pregnancy....I could have Throat punched all those people that are like “sleep now before the baby gets here”. Pregnancy pillow saved my life and I still actually sleep with it (U-shaped body pillow). I found it to be multi purpose- as even though it’s not recommended, when the baby wouldn’t settle, it developed a perfect nook (that he could sleep with me & not roll and I wouldn’t roll on him- baby life survival 101). 
-> I’d be crazy enough to consider another if I didn’t have to go through pregnancy.

Birth: Contractions sucked (I can only describe them as Adominal muscle Charlie horses that ripple & tense up your whole body) but I got an epidural which numbed me from the waist down. I should mention I have a deep fear of needles so getting the blood draws took a lot of willpower. I was trying to to do vaginal but he was breach and wouldn’t turn his head so I had to get a C-section. I remember crying about it because I felt defeated. It was insanely quick and I felt nothing. 

The recovery was bad though- I could not stand up, I had to reteach myself how to Pee & walk. When I came home, my husband was crucial in taking care of the baby - it was about three weeks before I could get back to some normalcy. 

When the baby came home, we tagteamed. My husband had two weeks of leave (The first of which was spent in the hospital from the C-section recovery). We tried to take the baby in shifts. 

The first two months were hell because the baby doesn’t know night from day and it’s too young to set routines/sleep train. But as the baby learns, it does get better (Hate to say that but it’s true). 
By three months the baby has developed a little bit of a personality and is less of a potato 🥔
They can smile at you and you can do more things. Routines are the key to survival (sleep trends & feed times). 

Up until two months, my average sleep was about four hrs. Three months,  it jumped up to six. Four months, he went through sleep regression (would wake up every hour), & I went back down to about 3 1/2. Five months and above, he’s been giving me seven hours & only waking up once at night. 

What have I found not as hard as specifically??? I am still very much me -have not changed my identity (you do not give birth and instantly become “mommy/child obsessed”). We still enjoy horror movies and still intend to travel (Im giving a three-year break to air travel as that’s my personal preference). The sacrifices (“loss of freedom”) aren’t as big as people make them out to be!! I seriously think people just love to complain or aren’t as organized. For example, we waited to be financially stable so that we could occasionally get a sitter and have some downtime. 
*I highly think this is a reason so many people complain- of course if you don’t have money or can’t get a break, you’re gonna be stressed and overburdened*

I was always a fencer sitter -never really liked or hated kids; I just didn’t relate to them. Never lost my mind over seeing a baby and never felt baby rabies urge. 

How did we decide? A lot of soul-searching & looking into my future with and without kids. I have no mom (no contact- too much baggage to explain) so I had to get over that mental hurdle first. I lost my dad to cancer 4 yrs ago and it made me think about family. I have a lot of love to give. We briefly considered adoption too... Still might be open to it. 

He is six months now and doing so much. Do you have any specific questions??"

Fencesitter,fpdv671,t3_gcw6ss,1588534877.0,"Mom of a 6m old - it’s not as bad as people make it out to be... The number one negative has been sleep deprivation (but I have an infant so take that with a grain of salt).

Despite popular opinion , you can raise a kid without spending a fortune.
 The most expensive thing has been the hospital bill (you won’t have) and child care cost. You will either sacrifice money for Childcare or sacrifice time. For example, I work flexible hours- I’m lucky though.

Speaking of time, everything takes a little more time (making sure you have a diaper bag, bottles, wipes and extra clothes before you leave etc) but it’s nothing unreasonable (I am a planner).

->People only focus on the negatives (as they are Easier to point out and people love to complain).
Kudos Thinking about adoption -I know it’s not an easy process but it’s such a positive thing For someone in need.

He still fights drowsy but awake sometimes & will lose his mind if we leave him in his crib; like you, we never had much luck with cry it out. 

What did work for us was a “delayed transition”- when he was little, we had a rock him to sleep before we put them in the bassinet or pack and play. Now he sleeps in his crib ...but only because he drops on us (on us for about 30 minutes to be sure he’s down) before the transition. He wakes up once or twice a night (He’s on a solid routine so I can mark the time almost down to the minute that he wakes at night).

So far, the sleep deprievation has been the only negative. Even that, we learned to take shifts and roll with it (there are good phases and bad with babies). We are more together because we are like team & we can tag each other in when needed.

I actually find myself more time consious than before baby.

We were savers before and still are. My 2 cents- you dont need half of the stuff that they say you do for a baby; it can be as cheap or expensive as you make it. Only the hospital bill (in the US) and daycare has been expensive.

Our relationship is still good (less sex but good still).

We are still very much ourselves identity wise (which has gotten a few comments from my In laws sometimes ...but o well).

I had to work hard to get him in the Bassinet or pack and play; even then, half of the time would be a struggle of putting him down (trying about 8 to 10x). At some point I picked my battles as it was easier to have him sleep in the crook of my arm & with the pregnancy pillow (I don’t roll & he’s secure) to get some sleep/be able to function."

waiting_to_try,f6ubj7u,t1_f6trywt,1573160630.0,"dumb question but I’m going to ask: you said you were in Boston (i’ve never been so totally just a shot in the dark here )- Would it make a cost difference using public transport as opposed to cars (pending how much in the city you are)? Or going down to one car (Saving insurance cost & parking, etc)? 

Also the price difference looking at older, smaller homes, fixer-upper’s or condos. 

-> I never intended my first home to be a condo (we were looking at townhomes) but it’s worked very well for us and has helped us move ahead."
waiting_to_try,f6trcz5,t3_dt10sb,1573153046.0,"Short answer- have a budget and stick to it! We use the every dollar app.

Husband and I are expecting our first child any day now- we make 55k together in a HCOL area (MD/DC area). We are both 30 and have been saving for years...paying off debts in our early 20s, cash only cars, no luxuries (camping only vacations, no going out to eat) and lastly saving up a decent down payment on a small condo (knowing its not forever). The buying vs. renting saved us the most the past few years- seriously, renting a VERY crappy/slum 232 sq ft studio cost over $1100 (no utilities included) vs paying $900 mth for a 2b, 2bth condo (includes Hoa, tax and utilites).

what area are you in? thats probably a big part of the problem.
