That sounds so impressive, and that gives me a tiny inkling of hope for grad school! 

I completely agree! I definitely see myself in other positions like as a guidance counsellor or teacher, but though STEM is difficult, I have no intentions of ever leaving my field. :)"

I genuinely do not enjoy being the center of attention and can honestly be really reserved and shy. I am willing to be somebody's personal therapist, but I get really uncomfortable after prolonged periods of time of  constant exposure to heavily emotional and vulnerable subject matters. I get emotionally burnt out a lot. Also,  I know we're often described as being unable to ask for help, but I am willing to ask for help whenever possible. I only ever see things as a burden if it's emotional but not when it's work-related. In addition to that, I really don't feel the compulsive urge to fix everybody's problems. Like sure I'll help, but it's /their/ thing at the end of the day. If they ask for help, I am very willing to drop everything and help somebody I really care about."

Then one day we were just walking in the winter, I tugged at his scarf, pulled him down to me and kissed him on the cheek. Then I asked him out. :) We've been together for a year and a half and counting, and I am never letting him go. 

Go for it! You won't regret it if you're this certain about him, and if you sense he's a kind soul. :)

Other than that, I think they'd theoretically be very nice to have around."
enfj,fpbjch2,t3_gc19me,1588471348.0,"I've been in a relationship with two INFPs. One lasted close to a year, and this has been my most successful relationship lasting a lovely 1.5 years and counting! :) 


1) What’s the good? 

• Growth: This is a relationship of constant growth, not because it's difficult but because we have similar yet different perceptions of the world. INFPS teach me to be more open-minded, optimistic, and less judgemental about my world view, and I think I teach them to have more confidence in their own perceptions and get excited about plans. 

• Acceptance: Also, INFPs have a knack for being able to let us let down our guard and be our absolute selves. We feel constant pressure to be ""on"" for everybody, happy, entertaining, while honestly secretly feeling a little lonely. However, INFPs definitely alleviate that burden from our shoulders, at least healthy ones I've dated! I never feel invalidated for my thoughts and feelings either!  

• Independence: I think it's amazing too how I've been able to retain aspects of my individuality in this relationship. Never have I ever felt forced or pressed to change. My INFP significant other and I just do our own thing even though we're within the same living space, but we're still the absolute best of friends, share inside jokes, and binge watch movies together at the end of the day. Nothing changes that. 

• Honesty: My INFP is very true to his values. He will stick his ground, and is very firm when it comes to things he believes in. I love how he is able to call me out on my bullshit, and I can do the same thing for him. He truly is my ideal life partner. I love that we always want the best for each other even if the truth hurts. 

• Mental stimulation: My oh my, you all have a variety of niche and geeky interests. I love it! Cause guess what? We're secret nerds too! I love our philosophical conversations and scientific discussions!



2) And what’s the bad?

ANS: I can think of one thing alone, and that you can be a little uncompromising at times. I only speak for the two INFPs I have dated. I know this can't be applied to every INFP, but yes, the INFPs I've dated had a tendency to be a little reluctant towards change. 



 3) What have you struggled with as a couple? 

ANS: Communication styles and conflict resolution styles! My INFP tends to avoid conflict. This is more personal than it is MBTI-related but he had a very difficult time understanding my anxiety and depression and was very frustrated with it for a while. However, I have since been in therapy so I've been learning more tools to self-soothe and we'v e been reading communication self-help books, and have date nights where we use a set of couple communication cards and just use them to talk about anything and everything.



4) How has other people’s involvement in your lives impacted your relationship? Eg family, friends 

ANS: I have always been ridiculously close with both INFP's family members. Their friends have also always liked me. My current significant other's friends pushed us together somewhat, so I was very grateful for that. I consider my INFP's family my own family too. :) I'm somewhat estranged from my family due to emotional abuse, and I kind of ran away from home and got a scholarship to study abroad so my family and friends have less to do with our relationship. However a close INTJ friend of mine was a very big advocate for the two of us! 



5) Do ENFJs have trouble communicating their needs? And if so - how do I pull it out of you

ANS: HAHHA Yes! It sucks to admit but it's true. At least for me it is. That is why I am in therapy. 

I definitely have major trust issues coming from abusive parents and having been through an abusive relationship in the past, so I can't speak for our type as a /whole/ but I would imagine it is also because we never want to be a burden to you or overwhelm you!

Honestly, just be direct with us. Maybe start with an observation if you feel something is wrong in your gut like, ""Hey I noticed you did x, y, z. What can I do to help and be here for you?"" 



6.) Finally what advice would you give an INFP to be a good partner to an ENFJ?


ANS: Just acknowledge what we do for you and be thoughtful! Also, communicate your thoughts, feelings, and needs too! That's all we want! :) 

This was a very thoughtful post!"
enfj,fpbguyk,t3_gc9p42,1588469705.0,"Oh my god yes. 

I have always been really attracted to shy guys, because they're such a mystery and they're so adorable! That's typically why I always end up dating introverts. It doesn't have to be dorkiness necessarily, just that element of slight social awkwardness or reservation (not that all introverts are socially awkward because some have more social grace and finesse than I do).  I love delving deeper and seeing shy people get out of their shell, because there's so much more to them than they show. 

I think it's definitely also preference! I definitely like being pursued as well, but I just love asking guys out more. It's cute :') Plus I love complimenting people, so watching my INFP significant other get all flustered is so darn cute!"
enfj,fp9xhgg,t1_fp9xbrq,1588436589.0,"No, actually! I would love to get to know one more personally, but I've only ever been really close with their introverted counterparts.

enfj,fp9wxai,t1_fp9wsq4,1588436260.0,"I can't speak for all ENTJs, but I definitely would have wanted to feel more heard in our work-place arrangement. I felt like I couldn't really speak up, though that could also be my people pleaser tendencies not to want to ""rock the boat."""
enfj,fp9wsxm,t3_gah5r8,1588436189.0,"I can be judgemental as an ENFJ myself, but never have I ever been /that/ critical with my partner's lifestyle and choices unless I saw that it was personally hurting them or I was under a lot of personal stress.

I don't want to jump to conclusions and say that they are an unhealthy ENFJ as they do have a different cultural and socioeconomic background from you, which definitely plays a factor. I come from East Asia, and my boyfriend is an INFP American, so the cultural messages we get also play a factor into our differences in our relationship. 

The best way to fix an issue like this is definitely to express your dissatisfaction over the situation, but in a very gentle way. The root of all problems is definitely a lack of understanding and miscommunication. Try to see if they're open minded to hearing your perspective. I feel like as long as you try to appeal to their side of the situation and acknowledge that you understand their point of view and their motivation for their criticism and maybe ""unsolicited"" advice (cause no shame and I'm calling myself out here: we do that a lot). 

If communication problems continue, I would seek into getting a relationship help book? I bought some communication cards that my partner and I use often to just talk and open up and express ourselves. I also bought a communcation book which we read from sometimes, and it's been very beneficial for both of us! 

ENFJs and INFPs definitely have very different ways of seeing the world, but that is no grounds for having your perspective invalidated."

I've definitely gotten better at that since then, because I've realised once I worked with one, that we have a very mutually beneficial work friendship. I think they're great people to work with, and their work ethic definitely matches my own. I've found working with an ENTJ to honestly be very instructive! I think we learn a lot from them and they learn a lot from us. I wish they'd listen a bit more ahaha but they're amazing really driven people. Look up to them so much!"
enfj,fp9ux7v,t3_gc6nsi,1588435073.0,"To all the INFPs I've loved before (hahahh):

Sooooooooo many things. I could probably talk all day about it. Many people don't know this, but ENFJs can be really really reserved at times, because we're genuinely always trying to get a feel for the group. We have a very adaptive personality, but somehow in front of you guys, that just completely melts away. I like how I don't ever feel invalidated or forced to act or be somebody, who's 100% happy and ""on"" all the time in front of you. A lot of the INFPs I've met have this innate ability to just make me feel so accepted, and it's honestly really frickin great. We ENFJs can be /such/ perfectionists and suffer from a burn out where we have to constantly push ourselves to always be more and do more, and I love that you bring us back down to earth. I like that you give me the compassion and ability to slow down. Simultaneously, I love that you guys have such a great sense of self? Like yes, you're chill with everything, but people underestimate how well you can call people out on their bullshit. I love that about you guys. You're my best friends. :')"

They were very controlling, and very emotionally stunted. They were also fierce helicopter parents, though also simultaneously emotionally detached at the same time. They were both really work and achievement oriented. I got a scholarship and moved away to a completely different continent, and I am now in therapy. That is all I can say."

I have since found my own place, thank God. Got along way more with my ISFP brother, but I can imagine him being there by himself is probably constantly draining him. 

Theoretically I feel like I could get along living with an ESTJ if they were just a friend? My friendships with SJs always tended to work out just because I've always just listened to them because they /do/ have a lot to offer.  

But yeah. Nope."

We stay in our own rooms, come out every once in a while to talk, eat together in the kitchen, and sometimes we even have movie nights together, or we play with her cat, complain about work, and just talk about literally anything. 

She does have a very well developed Fi, which is probably why, and I also do enjoy being alone a lot, so it's probably why it works out so well. Also, personally I just find her to be rife of life skills and life advice so I always take her advice. 

It's probably the most effortless dynamic I've had with a housemate."

One of the TV series I responded best to was an NBC series called, ""Timeless."" I absolutely loved it. It was a truly emotional series for me because it was a lot about the preservation of history, and the creation of radical sociopolitical movements.

Literature wise, I mean one of the books I felt that I loved the most was, ""The Scarlet Letter,"" by Nathaniel Hawthorne. Loved that book so much. I enjoy being placed in settings with fictional characters when it's them being pitted against dysfunctional systems.  

Other than that, a large majority of books I read are concentrated on self-help.

AnxietyDepression,fog11lf,t3_g6yzen,1587746281.0,"I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend of 1 year, and I too have had a lot of intrusive thoughts. I completely understand where you're coming from. I personally have been going to teletherapy sessions, and I opened up to him about it. He didn't understand right away, but it's normal for your person not to get it right off the bat especially if they have never experienced anxiety or have been exposed to it. 

I asked him for help to be brutally honest whenever I'm being ""too much,"" and to tell me. This helps with accountability, and it reminds you who you are fighting for. I love him so much, and I can tell you love your boyfriend so much too. 

I started this rule that I would start keeping a worry log, and if the worry persisted despite the evidence I have against it, then I would discuss it with him. My therapist personally also recommended this. It is very tough.. I have anxiety as well, and mild depression, which are arguably tough to deal with for any significant other or close friend/family member if not regulated properly. 

I do highly recommended trying some Cognitive Behavioral Therapy apps and mindfulness practices, as well as trying to keep a worry log. Know that you are normal.. Please don't hate yourself or be so hard on yourself! Please be compassionate with yourself on this journey. You are so much stronger than you think dealing with these thoughts in your head. The first step to change is to acknowledge the detrimental effects this could have on your relationship and you've done it. Our hearts are in the right places, even though are minds aren't. Not all your thoughts are facts, but every feeling you have is very very valid. Hang in there."

I have two major exams this week, so I am stressed out, and I also have a therapy appointment. I'm trying to take a step forward this week, and ask my counselor if I could potentially get a pill prescribed to me to help calm down my physiological symptoms. I've always had a prejudice against using any pill of any kind, so I want to get rid of that bias, and I'm looking forward to being able to potentially use it. Last week was awful. I took a day off because I was very anxious, and I was crying and feeling absolutely awful all week, so I'm looking to try to open up to her more and tell her I may need to meet her more often, and try not to be ashamed about it. 

I'm also trying to set foot in church again after what's been nearly a year.. and I want to get the courage to privately build my faith without being ashamed of having anxiety, and disagreeing with a lot of Catholicism while still being a Christian. Forecast shows a lot of discomfort ahaha but I want to push myself a little for myself and for my current relationships. I'm also celebrating Valentines' with my SO this week, and I'm really looking forward to giving him  his surprise!

offmychest,fgu4irm,t3_f0dg51,1581113317.0,"How you prefer to spend your time, and who you prefer to spend your time with is 100% always valid.

I definitely see where you're coming from, and I can definitely empathize with your frustration. 

I'm an ambivert dating an introvert. I have been in three relationships with introverts, and in many ways more than one, it has come with many beautiful, unexpected surprises. :) 

I honestly think everybody's both extroverted and introverted to an extent, and I subscribe to the theory that you can swing between both spectrums yet have a preference for one social energy more than the other. 

Reading from your list, I can definitely identify with a couple that I agree with, so here's an open letter to you:

People see what you are doing more than you think. People recognize you glue relationships together and gather people together. 

You are important, and a keyplayer in many events, and you are most definitely not a burden to your social groups. 

You are not an inconvenience. Get that out of your head. 

Sometimes it's just a matter of being around people whose social preferences just match your own, and ultimately being understanding of the differences in energy you all have. 

It definitely does suck initiating, but as an extrovert, one of your best skills is probably interpersonal communication. 

Talk it through, and be genuinely honest about what you need. 

We can all learn something from one another. I was definitely a lot more social at one point in my life, but I've learned to really look at alone time as an opportunity to get to know myself better. 

I was like.. wow! I adore sketching, sewing, astronomy, languages, baking, cooking, playing the guitar, and endless lists of things. Sometimes dissatisfaction with alone time is a matter of how you choose to spend your time! Try looking at workshops or hobby groups/clubs around the area!

My introverted significant other and my friends have also learned to enjoy going out more, but at very moderate doses and I'm grateful for the energy exchange!

I know this isn't exactly a support group, but I see you... I do. Keep up taking care of others around you and being an organizer. 

Also, I don't usually endorse personality tests, but try checking out the 16 personalities test! It was incredibly eye opening! It's not 100% spot-on but it really teaches you the spectrum of personalities out there and may give you a little insight into yourself! :)"
