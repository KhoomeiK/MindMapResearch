Physiology,ffz5cv4,t1_ffz3yiv,1580364543.0,"i think i worded that incorrectly.

Could you let me know if i have this concept correct?

Afferent arterioles are larger in diameter than in the glomerular capillary bed, meanwhile, the diameter in the efferent arteriole is smaller in diameter. Naturally, this difference in diameter from large to smalle causes a back flow of pressure, increasing the pressure in the capillary bed, aiding in the process of fluids leaking out of fenestrations and foot processes of podocytes.

I'm trying to understand the pressure in the glomerular capillary bed, and afferent/efferent arterioles and how it causes filtration or if it does at all. 

To my understanding pressure decreases as it goes from arteries to arterioles, to capillaries?

Sorry if im not really making any sense."
