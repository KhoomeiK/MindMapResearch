Anxiety,fo6see1,t1_fo4ym9b,1587565822.0,"> But really when you think about it, there's a lot of couples right that have issues and some work through them and some don't right?

First: Thanks for your long reply, I really value it. 
That's the thing, the situation of staying at home has just showed me that I don't really want to see her either.. usually I would be glad to see the SO everyday and only, but I am just not. And I think I am also projecting this on her and when she tries to even manipulate me a little bit, I flipped. I did not get angry towards her, but in my head. But the ""Its good to be emotionally dependent"" thing, I just can't get that out of my head, I really don't think that's healthy. But hey I made an appointment for therapy today :)"
Anxiety,fo4xg36,t3_fjpn80,1587513127.0,This should be a sticky! Thanks
Anxiety,fo4wz7p,t1_fo4d2k8,1587512863.0,"Oh that's not a wowthanks.. thing. That's basically what meditation is, observing your own thoughts and being over them mentally. It works reaaally well, it hasn't worked that well for me with panic attacks, but it's huge with anxiety when you need to perform. A job interview, which we probably all hate, but I use it most for my sport. Absolutely helps practicing that thought pattern, can be life changing for some."

relationship_advice,fnvcsfa,t1_fntxa2x,1587288423.0,"Nono don't want to deal with that at all.. thanks for your reply. I also have some mental issues that I need to take care off, I think I have undiagnosed ADD and I don't anybody right now. I think I project my own issues on her and that's not ok, she would be better off alone then too"
relationship_advice,fnvcpxi,t1_fntxiq8,1587288349.0,thanks :)
relationship_advice,fntwh14,t1_fntvswh,1587249916.0,"Oh definitely. I also see manipulative behaviour. Like making me jealous on purpose, with little things. Just to get a reaction. That's a no go for me. I would settle down if I found the right one, but no, not right now. Life's still way to busy and wild to do that :D it's just.. the little things you know? I don't like hearing cunt every day and being called ""bra"". She thinks it's funny, but I enjoy acting like an adult. That's not something that is worth working on is it?"
relationship_advice,fntvshe,t1_fntv4wz,1587249545.0,"You think so? I was in love at first, but maybe I just enjoyed being loved like that."

relationship_advice,fhxjqa5,t1_fhx65cc,1581955937.0,"I am doing fine I guess, but thank's for your answer."
relationship_advice,fhx59m2,t1_fhx51a8,1581945039.0,Yeah I am already looking for rooms nearby.. I can't really cope with that shit anymore its ruining also my life
relationship_advice,fhx58c2,t1_fhx4s7b,1581945006.0,"Well yes, you are right.. It's just sad you know, I knew him when he just went to uni and he was such a powerful person."
relationship_advice,femjazh,t1_femiiri,1579258476.0,"Well yeah. So I met with this other girl last year as I said, she fell pretty deeply in love with me when I did not at first, because I was too busy in my head to heal from my last relationship. Well then she did not want to see me anymore, wich I understood. To comfort her the exbestfriend told her some stories about me, namely how I cheated on a girlfriend of the past, a year before that. I really regretted that and I know thats a shitty thing to do. But afterwards we met again and I fell in love with her, she still loved me. It was the best two months ever, but she cut it, because she says that she has trust issue and was worried that I cheat on her. I treated her very well in those two months, did not meet anybody else, although we were not exclusive or so, and got my shit together, because I really wanted things to work out."
relationship_advice,exoaxkm,t1_exm0fvi,1566473251.0,"Upvoted, because it's true. I wrote her yesterday that I respect it that she wants some time alone and that she can write me whenever. She replied thats really sweet and that I can always call her if I need to. We'll see how this turns out."
relationship_advice,eo8soe9,t1_eo8sccq,1558373962.0,"Yeah you are right about that. I should respect her decision. I didn't say wtf lets stay together. I offered to talk about this tomorrow and I will tell her that I respect her decision. If she wants to stay with me fine if not I won't be pushy. I need to accept the consequences. You know, I had terrible anxiety attacks a few years back and I was depressed because of this. I always pushed the ones that cared away the most, so I kinda feel like thats what's going on. And during that time I was very happy that my gf stayed with me despite of that."
relationship_advice,eo8q17i,t1_eo8ox8e,1558372314.0,"She has been internalizing her feelings, she even said so. She has a very hard time expressing her feelings and what bothers her. I just don't believe she thought this trough. She never had a relationship longer than 3 months and I think she has some major trust issues. Maybe I am just not the right guy for her, but maybe her depression makes her think that. I love her a lot, so I thought it would might help to stick trough this and maybe talk about our problems than just ex and gone. Don't you think there is the chance this is possible?"
