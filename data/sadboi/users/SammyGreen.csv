Amazing how apt that term is.. sadly shows how the Irish were looked so down upon - and I’m resisting making a comparison to modern history out of respect.

I was wondering how the Choctaw became exposed to the Irish famine and coffin ships (it hurts to write that despite it not being my heritage) and that makes so much sense.

Caring for the plague stricken must have taken a huge toll on them.. I don’t suppose you know the impact? It gives me even more admiration of their compassion and generosity. It leaves me absolutely dumbstruck. And embarrassed that I’ve been so ethnocentric and overlooked the history of First Nation people apart from the colonial and modern eras.

WarhammerWhatIf,fpdzfln,t1_fpdtvjj,1588537311.0,"I would say it depends on what form it takes. In T2, it takes the shape of a cop. So a guardsman would be a good cover right? Again, it largely depends. Is the mission to pick them off one by one? Must be because it would be fucked if it tried taking them all on at once. Guilliman is back and on the council. Let's say he falls. The Adeptus Custodes can't be far behind. 

So let's say it decides to pick them off one by one (minus Guilliman). Either model will need to infiltrate by impersonating a **high** ranking member of the guardsmen to even get close. And as the High Council come from different factions (lets not even get started on the mechanicus) it would need to adapt further. A cop from the US is way different to a cop in China, for example. The T-800 only has the form it was made with. As far as I know, there is no canon that the T-1000 can change its form. I assume it can.. but even so.. 

In our universe we straight up don't believe in futuristic, time travelling killing machines. **That's exactly what necrons are!!** There would be MUCH less scepticism over the idea and, more likely, there are procedures and plans to defend against that threat. 

The more I think of it... nah man, skynet machines would be fucked in wh40k if they even so much thought about punching above their weight. What if they chilled on a planet like Pops did?

The T-800 in genisys (Pops *shudder*) grew old and had hobbies. But that’s because Pops had a mission to protect Sarah and, as an infiltrator, learned to adapt to human culture. It was also reprogrammed.

But to exist for the sake of existing? Honestly I can’t really see either model “surviving” without a goal. I see a more likely situation of them going idle until the receive instructions.

If they had instructions? Well, it depends. Kill Vect? They’re fucked. Kill some random planet governor? Totally doable.

Just because they have a power cell that lasts for whatever years doesn’t mean they were designed to last whatever years *after* their mission.

You know what? I actually wouldn’t be surprised if Skynet had programmed some self destruct mechanism^1 *after* they’d achieved their mission. Like, what the hell is the T-800 supposed to do if he’d killed Sarah in T1 until D-Day? Without a preprogrammed protocol, it was be lost in the winds.

BipolarReddit,fmzd1nk,t1_fmzc39t,1586515907.0,"I only accepted my diagnosis when I was 31 (35 now) and could have avoided a lot of cringey moments during my 20s :)

I also only took it seriously when I was hospitalized last year. Lost my job, lost my ex, lost almost everything.

So I’m fucking stoked that you’re grabbing the bull by the horns at your age! You’re right that a lot of people have no self awareness. 

Don’t be like other people. You be you. Always acknowledge that you will never stop growing as a person and growth comes from your experiences.

BipolarReddit,fmzbvm7,t3_fycwth,1586514538.0,"The shame never goes away. You learn to live with it and use it as a motivation to be a better person. When you’re hypomanic you’re essentially still the *same person* with less inhibition. But you’re kidding yourself if you use BP as a crutch.

BP is an explanation not an excuse.

OK story time as I can relate to what you wrote. I’m a flirty guy who gets away with it most of the time. I’m no Casanova but I do alright. Problem is that confidence grows and grows when I’m hypo. I lost a really good friend because at some point I apparently hit on his fiancée. But I have zero recollection of that ever happening! Being overly flirty is also one of the main reasons my ex left me. 

So what do I do? I acknowledge that it may/is a problem and I alter my behavior to minimize that aspect of me when I go hypo. Hypo is like a positive feedback loop where my behavior going in just get amplified.

I’ll still fuck up in the future and so you will. Let’s use these episodes as growing experiences."

Shut up!! I’ve been struggling with word recall but never thought it had something to do with lamictal! Oh man that makes so much sense looking back on the last year.

Edit: Haha what? Apparently lamictal can also increase the risk of sunburn! What a weird drug."

gamernews,fmbdfni,t1_fmb36u6,1585924090.0,It’s break even. You could argue that the goodwill generated from DRM free games lead to them being “trusted” by the gamer community. Like they “listen” more than other AAA studios. Throw that down as an intangible asset and it makes sense.

Oh wait.. I thought of one.. closing the borders to China and Europe but **ignoring the rest of the fucking world**. And it wasn’t even done because he was worried about corona, it was just fucking politics!
