Anxiety,fqcsan3,t3_ghiqy2,1589267280.0,"Yes Iâ€™m feeling this way right now I just had this great video chat with a guy that Iâ€™ve met many years ago. I was so nervous talking to him I thought I was repeating myself and when we hung up after about 40 minutes I text him apologizing to him for me being awkward and he said to me that I was an easy-going person to talk to Iâ€™ve been overthinking and I dislike myself for this sometimes wish I didnâ€™t have to do that but itâ€™s so hard not to when he told me that Iâ€™m too into my head and said Iâ€™m totally fineðŸ˜ž 

 Sorry for the run-on sentences and grammar I record messages it helps me express myself better."
