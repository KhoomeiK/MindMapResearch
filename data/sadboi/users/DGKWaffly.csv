depression,f25pr68,t1_f1xho9e,1569980637.0,"Yo I know you got a bunch of replies but I feel you dawg. I can also sleep 20 hours in a day. Like bare minimum 11 to actually be able to function somewhat okayish. So if I don't go to bed early I'll feel like its not even worth going to bed at that point. So naturally my only guarantee that I will actually be awake to tend to my responsibilities is for me to stay up the whole night. I have insomnia so I take meds reguarly. If I don't take them I almost feel half dead after the all nighter. Without taking them I feel really tired but even if I do decide to lay in bed I absolutely will not sleep. I laid in bed for 8 hours waiting for sleep, it never came. Anyways I try to have the best attitude I can have but it's damn hard. I hope you know that you are not alone. We're all trying to survive the best we can. It gets the better of me at tipping points sometimes. Regardless, I feel you dude. Everyday's a battle, sometimes people(like me) start to care less about winning. I feel like we're not working towards a destination but rather making the journey progress rather than trying to make it perfect. Easier said than done. I hope things get brighter for you."

I think most of us are aware of what Adblock is, but we are also aware that we are preventing the people we enjoy from making money. You can either not watch ads, or make sure the people you enjoy watching make money. Which would you choose?"
legaladvice,eqr73b5,t1_eqquvj2,1560251319.0,"I realize what hemp is, I am not talking about anything that has a delta 9 concentration of more than .3%. I want the plant that is used to make rope, cloth, bioplastics, etc. Not interested in the Cannabis plant containing high levels of THC. Are you saying hemp is illegal, or that cannabis with more than three-tenths of one percent is illegal, because I am genuinely curious. If you could clarify for me, I'd really appreciate it."
CBD,eqgh65g,t1_eqg4b45,1560036323.0,The only antidepressant that has actually helped me is sertraline/zoloft. It doesn't make me automatically happy but it makes my life manageable and for that I'm very grateful. I haven't taken CBD regularly so I'm not sure how helpful it is. I take it by smoking flower and can't imagine doing it everyday.
