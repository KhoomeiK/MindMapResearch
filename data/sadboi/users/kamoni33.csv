Petioles,fqyxqvr,t1_fqn95kb,1589756376.0,"I have experienced some of that too. It is frustrating. 

One positive indicator is finding a therapist with an end goal and who wants you to not become codependent on therapy. They are there for support. 

It also really helped to find a therapist who didn’t judge me for not wanting to be medicated. That was surprisingly hard to find.

I feel better and they are making sure we don’t develop an unhealthy relationship. They are definitely up to date on modalities and  trauma research. Seeing this post assured me they aren’t reducing sessions for an ill intended reason. 

Before I met this therapist, I was in an unhealthy codependent relationship with a therapist who relied on EMDR for trauma. I am really glad I did not stick with this technique because my current therapist has not suggested to use it, it seems a little hokey, and it is an old technique from what I have read. However the therapist who was suggesting it was really trying to push it on me. I am proud I went with my gut and said no, even if I wasn’t sure why. I can get more benefits than EMDR from a good night’s sleep, since it depends on REM. 

Trust yourself, I guess? It is our treatment plan after all."

It is easy to blame and dismiss others, but in that process we reject an entire person’s experience. If that was done to me, I might not have recovered. I was irate and bitter when I had PTSD. If I was not shown compassion, I would have stayed that way. Now, I am dedicated to paying it forward. People need care."
CPTSD,fewcym1,t1_feuwgnn,1579408567.0,"But it doesn’t work that way. After I recovered from PTSD symptoms, I became more aware that others around me are struggling with their own unresolved trauma. It was not easy for me to recover but, I finally had the resources and willpower to heal. It took me 25 years to get diagnosed and get help, so it doesn’t seem farfetched to imagine other people need a little validation to help them to realize they need help too. Some never see it and are constantly lashed out on because they are in pain, so they lash out on others. Perhaps they are deeply hurt because they neglected themselves, as I once did. I deserved to heal and so do they. Everyone’s path is different and no trauma is worse than another.  

Validation of my experience helped me recover and therefore I think can help others heal, too. It took me a long time to feel stable enough to get to this stage, so I am not suggesting anything or blaming you for lack of empathy at all. You have your own health to manage, first and foremost. I thought sharing something that helped me mend broken relationships would be useful. Having compassion for others helped prevent me from internalizing the projected emotions of others, particularly my own birthing unit. Best of luck, it is not easy and hope this helps you to feel liberated from them blaming you."

Labels can be helpful on a personal level, but there can also be too many that overcomplicate things on a general level. A simpler and more inclusive label might be needed for such purposes. After all, words and labels are powerful tools!

Perhaps, that would help everyone calm the fuck down and love to who they so choose without having to over explain (imo a romance killer).

Playing with our pets or watching other people’s pet videos online

Cooking new things, baking too

Keeping plants

The timeline was just an estimate for how quickly I expect to see reduced symptoms after daily therapy exercises and homework. I plan to stay off THC during treatment. 

You would need to find your own treatment plan and personally having the right kind of help made a big difference. Conventional therapists did not help me as much as seeing a therapist who specializes in PTSD, which I guess seems obvious but it took me time to seek one out.

I was essentially forced to find a different way to manage my stress and anxiety, which is fine because ideally I would like weed to just be a past time I enjoy on special occasions, like alcohol.

So I temporarily am stopping this year while I live life without THC. There are so many other ways to relax! It just takes some time to adjust.

Example

A) mode of intake: vaping, edibles, oils, flower
B) method of reduction: cold turkey, slowly weaning, quickly weaning

Then trying different combinations depending on what you have available, seeing how it affects you, and all while being very patient/honest with yourself.

I found the right combination that worked for me.- quick weaning (1-2 days) with edibles. It took me months to figure out what works for me. 

I really did not expect this to work because I am not much of an edibles person, but the results were so much better (for me) than by quitting smoking joints/bowls or vaping oil pens. Cold turkey did not work for me at all and slow weaning (over 1-2 weeks) made me too anxious.

Petioles,fchkq5u,t1_fch6pe9,1577651366.0,I understand. I have quit so many times that I have lost count from vaping and smoking. Quitting from edibles is not the same experience for me though and I suspect I might be free of counting the days. I just don’t care about THC anymore and it feels wonderful.
Petioles,fchkag4,t1_fccu2j7,1577651227.0,"Thanks! I have never had such an easy time quitting. I have posted about it here before. It would be like “hell week” for me and when I would finish the week all I would crave it a puff to reward myself for getting through it. I think being an ex smoker who used weed to quit smoking cigarettes years ago might have made me psychologically dependent on oral inhalation.


Edibles feel more like food and less like smoking. I live in a legal state so I used 2mg mints to moderate my dose and brought it down to zero over the course of 2 weeks. I don’t like edibles that are candies or baked goods. The mints are easier to just pop in whenever. I had fun with them too over Christmas.

I feel great and I just wanted to pass on what helped me in case it does help anyone who has these intense withdrawals like I used to. I haven’t even felt a moment of discomfort. It is unbelievable for me! Ready for a THC free 2020

Sorry for my long reply :00"
CPTSD,fchh9nj,t3_eh4pzk,1577650453.0,"Me too. I actually got way kinder but less accepting to people who put people down for being different.

I did not expect this. I listen better too. I want to understand people because ultimately that is what is helping me heal- being listened to"
Petioles,fcbhep1,t3_egwv7p,1577586897.0,I just made a post on overcoming withdrawal symptoms using edibles instead of smoking or vaping. Then I saw this and maybe my post can be helpful.
unpopularopinion,fcadqhv,t3_egqo98,1577567494.0,Sounds like your coworkers know they are being gross and do not care. I kind of admire people who aren’t hurting others and can just be themselves. I am on their side

bisexual,fc9yhwy,t1_fc9woig,1577560104.0,"You’re right. I might need to carry my own little torch to facilitate that space. It will make me feel more purpose and confident in myself. I would want my child to embrace her identity when she is an adult, too. I must be an example in that regard. Her late father was bisexual and I never had to worry about this feeling until after he passed. I never felt alone. I was lucky to have him.

Thank you deeply for your hopeful and realistic message. I am getting too old to keep waiting until it is “safe” to come out. Hiding does no good. It is so painful too. I want to feel alive again.

Biphobia is so ubiquitous. It is mind boggling!!

Added- What apps are suggested for finding bi circles? I am so new to this. I am done hiding"
