BipolarReddit,fcn5ig1,t1_fclerl9,1577803813.0,"Lots of people don't do their jobs very well either! And many of us do not have loved ones who care about our bipolar.

Bipolar is a condition where medication compliance is really, really difficult. It's awesome that you're able to take your meds consistently, but for many of us that just isn't the case. You're asking a question that has no answer other than a tautological one: we stop taking our meds because we stop taking our meds. 

I wish I was more like you in this regard, but I'm not."

DatingAfterThirty,f66donp,t1_f5j8vff,1572709832.0,"Update, he called me and told me he was lying about his mom and is married. Knew this seemed weird as fuck. Glad to be rid of him."
DatingAfterThirty,f5j8vff,t1_f5f2clg,1572222841.0,"We talked on the phone today and he's beside himself, so he's either a complete sociopath or he's being honest. He's flying out today and said he'd love to see me when he returns and that he's sorry. He also told me he doesn't want to date other people and that we should talk about that when he returns. 

I've been ghosted so many times that I'm still mildly suspicious, so I didn't make any promises, but I don't think he's lying about his mom."
datingoverthirty,f5icujo,t3_dnhezt,1572213240.0,"I was engaged like 15 years ago and would never think to mention it unless it came up (like if someone asked me directly). Marriage seems more important to mention, I would say by date three, but an engagement that didn‚Äôt work out, unless it was recent, seems ok to not really disclose... at least in my opinion."
AskReddit,f49qbno,t3_djrt15,1571479886.0,"I'm a college professor. We are all mentally ill (seriously, everyone I did my PhD with including me is bipolar) and most of us are drug addicts or alcoholics or both (I'm just a drug addict, I don't drink anymore). 

Also, we all know what professors are fucking their students, and if you're a student fucking a professor you aren't the first or last student they'll fuck."
DatingAfterThirty,ewjdtod,t1_evw4xjj,1565465153.0,"Yeah, like you, I‚Äôm just not looking to be a mom to someone. I‚Äôve dated people with every level of education, from high school to fellow PhDs, and the men are all very intimidated by my PhD and my mid-30s age. We are literal living proof that we do not need a man to survive, and we are therefore less likely to put up with ridiculous bullshit from men, which intimidates, frustrates, and angers a whole lot of them."
bipolar,esjso57,t3_c82ye0,1562040864.0,"Same. You're not alone. I spent a lot of time talking about this in therapy today, actually. Take care and I'm sorry you're suffering."
BipolarReddit,eshoyco,t3_c7kmb8,1561998074.0,"This is all absolutely true, but it's an impossible bitch to do them all!"
BipolarReddit,esholl7,t3_c7tlxd,1561997842.0,"Hi, I'm also rapid cycling with mixed state bipolar two, with lots of noise sensitivity and social stuff (being in a group of people absolutely ramps me up and makes me hypomanic). And irritability--woo boy, I get myself into a lot of trouble with my white-hot anger. And I'm introverted too. So HI! There are other people like you out there, and I am one of them! Like you, I do know that I often wish I was much less intelligent and much more mentally stable. But these are the brains we got. And I am so full of self-loathing/hatred, and full of speedy thoughts about how much I suck, all the time, and it's really really hard. So I see you, and I feel you, and I'm sorry you're suffering like this. 

When I **take my meds regularly**, I am less sick of myself. (But because I have bipolar it is really hard for me to be consistent with my medication.) I also seem to do better when I **interact with people less**, but that's a whole Thing because I also, like any other human, crave and need human connection! I also do not drink (although I do smoke pot), but I have found that **having a small group of friends to craft with** is really good for me. It's chill, there's no alcohol, and it doesn't usually trigger me into hypomania when I spend time (especially during the afternoons/evenings while it is still light outside on a weekend) with a group of trusted, chill people that I know. Oh, and **exercise** is so helpful for me. I stopped working out over the last two weeks due to some scheduling issues and my brain has not been happy as a result. And **a regular sleeping schedule**. Sometimes I really can't sleep but shutting myself in my room, with the lights off, and no media (no phone, no tv, no electronics!) for eight hours every night, no matter what my mood, helps.. 

Take care. I'm sorry you are feeling this way. You are not alone."

BipolarReddit,epev5eh,t1_epecz86,1559187467.0,"Yeah sorry I am frustrated with men who have treated me this way and hate seeing it happen to others.

I find that exercising regularly is really, really good for my mood and stability. I do some cardio and strength training 4-6 days a week and it's been great. I don't track my weight because it stresses me out, but I have gained muscle and feel amazing ever since getting into going to the gym regularly. 

I also don't drink alcohol and that is really good for my overall health and weight."
bipolar,epeu66q,t3_buo8z4,1559187097.0,"They are not the same drug, but lots of people have tried both. I tried Lamictal and it did not work so then I tried Latuda. Trying both these drugs at different times is a common experience for many of us. You might have tried Lamictal for many reasons anyway after trying Latuda. 

Try not to stress out too much. Starting a new drug is really hard and has a lot of emotions associated with it. Take care of yourself."
