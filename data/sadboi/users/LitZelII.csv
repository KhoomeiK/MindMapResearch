So in conclusion, i still dont truly know what causes this, maybe its the item count. Im not sure. I do have 800+ items aswell. So it might be that too. I really dont know. I just hope something gets done about this."

What im hoping they do to POSSIBLY fix it is move their servers when they decide to release it for epic store only in the near future (which is happening if my sources are correct).
