Dump your bf, he obviously doesn't care about your dog and I think you might not either if you keep letting your dog get traumatized and abused by YOUR partner. You have a duty to protect and care for your animal and you are clearly not doing so if you see your dog in discomfort and YOU DONT DO A DAMNED THING. This is how animals get euthanized. 

If this was a human be was doing this to, if would be classified as abuse, you wouldn't stand there if he was doing this to a human, you would do something. By not helping your dog you are letting him being abused and adding to this abuse by not being his advocate. This is disgusting.
I honestly hope this dog goes to a home where be will have people advocating for his health, mental and physical. Not you."

There was a different from the moment I got the bit in his mouth. He responds better to this bit and the difference is awesome but he still doesn't like it. And I don't want this to be a painful experience for him in anyway so bit less was my next step.  And while he  I use a rope halter everyday, I have ridden in it and it does ok but I don't particularly like it that much. 
Atm we are building up his strength and establishing good cues as he has been out of work for a few months. I mostly ride for leisure/training right now but I do plan on resuming lessons when I think my horse can handle it and when I can too.‚ò∫Ô∏è
