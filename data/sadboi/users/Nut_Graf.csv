That said, I can’t make you to feel any other way. Would that I could. I can offer a bit of advice. I hope that’s OK.

No emotions are invalid. To regret and to feel guilty are part of life. But take care you’re not consumed by them. If you’re unable to forgive yourself now, or tomorrow, or next week, try setting a deadline. Say to yourself, “I’m going to regret past mistakes till Friday, then I’m going to try to forgive myself.”

This trick has worked for me before. If you try it, I hope it works for you. I meant what I said. You deserve to be happy and to have a healthy amount of pride. The sum of all your mistakes doesn’t even come close to meaning you deserve the suffering you’ve endured."

Because you get overwhelmed, I think it makes sense you feel guilty more often. It’s a defensive reflex. Someone seems upset; guilt comes in to keep them from giving you a hard time. I struggle with my version of the same.

Something that helps me is a little truth: 9 times out of 10, when someone seems upset with you, they’re really upset about something that has nothing to do with you. That doesn’t mean your feelings are invalid, but it does mean you’re free to question whether you ought to feel guilty. Maybe you can feel annoyed instead, since they’re taking feelings out on you."

Had I stayed in my poor, rural hometown, and was forced to enter a more menial job to have a good life, then I might not have had the experiences that led me to care about policy and its effects.

Put another way, it's hard for people to suddenly begin caring about something complicated and big-picture like policy. Maybe your mom hasn't had experiences that instilled a care about policy and rewarded it. That said, my guess is your mom cares a lot about you. If you talk to her about your thoughts and concerns and invite her to comment, then you might be the one who helps her discover her own beliefs."

PoliticalPhilosophy,fh22yyf,t1_fh21we0,1581232887.0,"Yes, providing a basic income to voters would be a material incentive, but it's still coercing people to vote. (Because not voting would be mean going without income needed to survive.) If I'm not mistaken, Australia is one liberal democracy that requires its citizens to vote and fines them for failure to do so. The threat of a fine is also coercion.

People already have material incentives to vote, and when properly informed people will vote in their own interests. I realize that when Donald Trump was elected in 2016, a common refrain appeared that said, ""poor white people voted against their own interests."" In my view, the 2017 tax reform proved that was at least partly true.

Voter turnout in the U.S. is low, relative to other liberal democracies. People tend to be captivated by national politics, but are unable to name state-level legislators. The reasons for these problems are manifold and complex, and I don't think a basic income incentive would rectify them."
PoliticalPhilosophy,fh14civ,t1_fh11s7l,1581210735.0,"Again I recommend you read ""One Person, No Vote.""

I live in Indiana, and when our ID law was implemented not one person in all our state's history had been convicted of voter fraud. Meanwhile, we know that voter ID laws have suppressive effects among certain populations. The recent leaks of documents by Denis Hofeller (I think I'm spelling that correctly), who helped orchestrate GOP voter suppression, show that the GOP intended to suppress the vote through voter ID laws."
PoliticalPhilosophy,fh103u5,t1_fh0tkj1,1581209371.0,"I disagree force is needed for coercion, but I’m not going to argue about it.

The GOP voter suppression I’m referring to has taken place in the past few decades. You are right the Democratic Party instituted Jim Crow, but that fact is irrelevant to my point: If citizenship is contingent upon voting, and powerful people prevent certain people from voting, then those people are wrongfully, unjustly denied citizenship."
PoliticalPhilosophy,fgz0zmk,t3_f0rigv,1581189486.0,"A couple thoughts:

1. Withholding a basic income for failing to vote is coercive. For people who earn livable wages at their jobs, the coercive effect would be less palpable. For people in precarious situations though, I believe it would be coercive.
2. Citizenship is incredibly important, and living in the U.S. without being a citizen can lead to struggle and suffering. For years now the GOP has suppressed voting. Before the Voting Rights Act, African Americans were disenfranchised since the late 1800s. Plus, for many poor and working Americans, voting interrupts work schedules, which must be maintained to keep bills paid, food in the kitchen, etc. I fear a voting test for citizenship could be abused to devastating effect to deny people citizenship.

I recommend two books: ""One Person, No Vote,"" by Carol Anderson. And ""Notes of an Undocumented Citizen,"" by Jose Antonio Vargas."

A President Bernie could use public pressure against conservative Democrats and vulnerable Republicans in the Senate.

You feel a life worth living is impossible. Please trust me when I say my heart breaks that you feel that way. Depression empties us of hope and makes it very hard to refill. Often the harder we try, the more despair seeps in instead. I’ve lived my versions for years. So I relate.

Yet the simple truth is feeling is not knowing. Maybe the nightmares you fear will happen. Maybe the hateful labels you assign yourself are true. (You have excellent grammar and punctuation, so I very highly doubt you are stupid.) However, maybe you recover from depression and live your life just as happily as the rest of us. Maybe you meet a boyfriend who finds you beautiful and loves you very much.

No one knows the future, so no one knows what’s possible.
