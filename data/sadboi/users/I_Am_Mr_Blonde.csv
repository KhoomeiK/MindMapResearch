Put on some music you like, get your supplies (whether it be school work or other) and break it down. It’s not three classes worth of work, it’s one page.

Take the first page. It can be the easiest or hardest, I usually leave large writing assignments at the end since they can be so draining. But maybe one page is too big of a hurdle.

Write your name. Congrats, that’s step one. Read the first question. Do you understand it? If not, highlight or underline what’s not clear. Sometimes bipolar can just make you unable to read and decipher, so breaking down text will help.

Did you answer the first question? Great! Take a breath. Try the next one! Finish the page? Congrats. Talk a short walk if you feel overwhelmed and come back.
