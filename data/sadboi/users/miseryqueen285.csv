acne,fqy9hlf,t1_fqy2ndv,1589744926.0,"congrats on clearing your acne! for scarring i’d say look into products that have ingredients such as salicylic acid, niacinamide, and azelaic acid. i heard a lot of great reviews about tretinoin too, but it’s recommended to wait at least six months after Accutane before using it. i would also recommend using Vitamin C Serum daily, and use sunscreen RELIGIOUSLY with an SPF of at least 50 or more. apply it everyday even if it’s cloudy or you’re not going anywhere. without the daily application of sunscreen, everything i just stated above is invalid. you can also look into chemical peels or non-ablative laser skin resurfacing treatments about six months after your Accutane treatment. unfortunately it’s a bit pricey, but i promise you the results are worth it. good luck! 👍🏽"

acne,fqveqer,t3_gl5ii6,1589675707.0,"I’ve gone through two rounds of Accutane (40 mg). The first treatment lasted four months (with my skin relapsing shortly after) and the second treatment lasted nine months. Since then, I’ve been keeping a simple routine: 

AM
- CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser
- Timeless Skin Care 20% Vitamin C + E Ferulic Acid Serum 
- CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion
- Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence SPF 50+ PA ++++ (2018) 

PM
- CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser
- CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion 

I also got referred by my dermatologist to some salicylic acid chemical peel sessions and they seem to be helping a lot with my  scarring and overall skin texture.

infp,falsncj,t1_falffh7,1576189780.0,"> it shows that they aren’t able to see opinions as valuable or valid if they are anything but their own.

funny you say that considering the downvotes lol. get this, me and OP are BOTH complaining. OP is complaining that they are sick of the live chats while i am complaining that i am sick of seeing complaints about them. we are BOTH complaining and thus BOTH “doing what we wanna do.” but yet one complaint is being favored over the other, for the exact same reason you are accusing me of. 

if that’s the case then me and OP are clearly not seeing our own complaints as valuable or valid because they conflict with our own opinion of live chats.
