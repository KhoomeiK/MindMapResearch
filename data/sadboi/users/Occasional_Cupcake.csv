relationship_advice,fnjog8h,t3_g20lfj,1587003329.0,"Good on you for getting out. I do want to shed a little light on food addiction to you though, as someone who has struggled personally with a binge eating disorder (though I definitely have not gained a hugely significant amount of weight because I’m very active)

In response to what you gain out of it, dopamine basically. Eating releases dopamine which is a biological response to prevent you from dying of starvation. Eating feels pleasurable. It’s often a result of depression or trauma. It’s a very hard addiction to fix, because you cannot avoid food. I know that I personally when I see I’ve gained a little weight from binge eating punish myself by just eating more, feeling like I don’t deserve a good body. I think it would be somewhat healing for you to do some research on food addiction and binge eating. I think it’ll help you get a better grasp on what happened. A therapist should be able to explain and talk you through some of that as well.

Be safe! Don’t get down about finding someone else. I was in a highly abusive relationship once that I thought I’d never move on from or get over but that was because the extensive manipulation made me think that way. You’ll find your footing and figure it all out when you’re ready. Do it get into a new relationship until you take care of YOU first though. Do a full autopsy of this relationship with a professional and realize where this went south, and you’ll be able to pick up some skills for your next relationship as well as raise your standards on how you deserve to be treated."

funny,fmwjl50,t1_fmvg5c0,1586447742.0,"When you pluck you are pulling the hair out at the root, when you shave you’re just cutting the hair down to skin but leaving the root intact. Plucking makes hair take longer to grow back because it’s gotta start over, shaving it just has to push back out from under the skin and the root is still in tact. Shaving doesn’t do any damage to your hair at all. It doesn’t make it grow back thicker, or thinner, or darker, or different, those are all wives tales. Plucking however can do damage to the hair follicle over time because you’re repeatedly ripping it from the root - that’s why you see older women in 2020 with the sperm cell eyebrows from the 90s, because they over plucked and now it won’t grow back.

By shave the ends I meant shaving the outer half of my eyebrow and leaving the inner half so I could draw in the ends different.

To trim the tips of your brows, get a [spoolie brush](https://stylecaster.com/beauty/best-spoolie-brushes-amazon/) , brush the brow hairs straight up, and use a cuticle scissor to snip the ends off. It’s a little tricky, so I’d suggest watching a YouTube video or two to get the hand of it lol"

I personally dislike logging food. It ends up turning into a lot of self punishment if I go over the daily amount. I’m trying out just eating what I like but applying more portion control to it, so I don’t feel deprived. That method is working better for me than counting calories ever has.

relationship_advice,fl8qdzh,t3_flew19,1584929743.0,"Abuse survivor here. We have a tendency to idealize our abusive partners to accommodate for the abuse. The way she speaks about him seems to me like she’s somewhat repressing the abuse and trying to keep in mind the good qualities. In this case his personality sucked so all that’s left is his physical appearance. Generally in abusive relationships, the abusive partner will also saddle the victim with guilt about any ideas to walk away from the relationship. She probably still has a seed of doubt planted in her mind about whether she made a mistake leaving. He most likely convinced her she needed him.

She entered into a relationship with you very shortly after. She never got to sit down and perform a relationship autopsy and work through the emotions and trauma. 

I understand her comments are hurtful and I’m sorry it’s impacting you and the relationship. She definitely needs to fix that. I’d suggest bringing it up to her gently, and in the context of suggesting she enter therapy to cope with her emotions.

Don’t forget that she’s with you, not Brock. All she can think to say positively about him are his looks and that doesn’t mean jack shit. She’s with you."
AmItheAsshole,fl5ob22,t3_fmi0lp,1584841571.0,"YTA. I understand why this is hurtful to you, but in order for the therapist to help your son they have to get the root of the issue. Just because your son isn’t exactly right in feeling that way doesn’t mean he doesn’t feel that way. Once the therapist identifies the issue, they can navigate helping him change his perception of lgbt people.

Divorce is traumatic for kids. He’s lashing out. He’s not in the right but you’re not going to get anywhere with him if you don’t allow him to express his feelings to you or (especially) his therapist. Therapy comes in steps, it isn’t all summed up in one appointment. 

I just wanna add that I understand that you’re very hurt too, and your own experiences have made you feel like this is an attack on your character. I don’t blame you for feeling that way and I suggest that you seek therapy as well, as I’m sure this was traumatic for you too and you could probably use some help navigating the situation. I don’t think you’re a bad person or truly an asshole, but you were in the wrong here and hopefully peoples responses helped you realize your mistake and you can try this again with your son."

Your sister looked after 3 kids 10 & under so you could have a vacation. That’s a lot to ask of someone and she did it cause she loves you and your kids. She decided to enjoy the time with your kids and let them have a little fun, I don’t see anything wrong with that and I think you really need to lighten up. This was kind of a staycation for your children and they should be able to enjoy their time too.

But I’m not gonna say you’re an asshole. You clearly suffered as a kid over poor decision making by your parents, and tbh you sound a little traumatized to me, which is completely understandable. I see this from the perspective of someone (me) who has a binge eating disorder - watching your appearance change over something you can’t control is actually pretty scary and you seem to have developed slightly disordered eating as a result - you may be eating healthy meals but your mindset behind it sounds disordered. I don’t think you’re an asshole because you’re clearly concerned for your kids health and well being and clearly something triggered shitty memories for you which upset you. However, I’d seriously consider counseling to deal with whatever unresolved feelings you have on this, and I’d make amends with your sister and apologize for being angry, because it WAS unwarranted.

It’s not the behavior/reaction that makes you an asshole, it’s what you do after. If you can admit you overreacted and sit down and really ask yourself why this upset you and work on that, there’s no assholes here."

So I feel like this doesn’t actually leave +1 territory. Ones working, other is invited and can bring a guest.

I totally understand your guests side of it, and I also understand you not wanting others to feel offended by it. I don’t think anyone here has poor intentions and you asking for others opinions and taking your other friends into consideration before making your decision shows mindfulness."
AmItheAsshole,fjczz68,t3_fcgjjd,1583242120.0,"NTA - however I personally would just point blank tell these people that that isn’t an appropriate question and they’re making you uncomfortable. Simply because if they don’t have the common sense to know not to ask this, they probably don’t have the common sense to realize that your reply was given to avoid the conversation and may just go to the next gay person they meet and ask them invasive questions too since they couldn’t get it out of you. Telling them straight up that that shit isn’t ok will (hopefully) embarrass them enough to keep them from bugging other LGBT people in the future or even asking YOU more questions another time."

AmItheAsshole,fiu3bvk,t3_f9m670,1582734434.0,"NTA, this is exactly why those “cool girls” aren’t still in my social circle at almost 22. You probably helped her realize that that isn’t the energy she needs around her"
AskReddit,fikc1er,t3_f87myj,1582477450.0,"I often don’t, but when I can help someone who needs it and can see that it truly made a difference for them I feel a sense of purpose and want to keep going"

He’s a Michael Jackson impersonator, my friends actually made the wrestling gear for this match, and I was standing on the top floor watching in real time lol. Dudes a legend."

I’ll get her checked out if I need to but I’m pretty certain this is a behavioral issue."
askwomenadvice,fhias0z,t3_f38vo3,1581621101.0,Wait wait wait. You guys aren’t in a relationship and she’s made it clear she’s not looking for one so I’m confused about what the issue here is.
vegaslocals,fhft8w1,t1_fhfs7rp,1581550767.0,"I have not looked into working for another talent agency because part of my plan over the next 1-2 years is to start my own business, a production studio. I’m avoiding talent agencies because I do not want to get caught up in a non compete agreement that won’t allow me to start my own business in the near future, as it’s a pretty similar field and aspects of my business model will be similar to the business model of a talent agency (because I plan to have some contractors with the company that can be hired out for crew work).

I’m happy that working for the one I did gave me the opportunity to move up a chain and provided me with some management experience though!"

I have to send photo proof that I have them and I don’t currently. Never heard of Steadyapp, will look that one up today. I’m sure there’s a bus route to eastern so I’ll look into that as well!

As of right now, I have a phone call with a restaurant around 4:30, and two interviews tomorrow, so fingers crossed that something here pans out and I can get back to work this week 🙏"
vegaslocals,fhbiuyl,t1_fhbf8tj,1581443179.0,"Wow! That’s crazy. Nothing like that exists where I’m from, it’s like a whole other world to me. I’d love something more long term, and would be happy to push for it, I just also need something right now for the meantime.

I’ve seen Vegas be really rough on people too - I moved away and recentered for a year before coming back. It’s been hard for me because I just don’t have anyone out here really and jobs out here (esp in food/bev) operate differently than what I’m used to in MD.

I really appreciate all the detailed info and help. I’m still learning about all of this and everything I learn is super useful."
vegaslocals,fhbepzd,t1_fhbc99p,1581440767.0,"Thank you so much! I will definitely read it and look into moving into a union job.

I know restaurants are slow for a bit still, this was an unfortunate time to be let go from one. I’ll do whatever I have to to get by for now of course."

You don’t know me so please don’t comment on my life. I’m just looking for work."

2020s been pretty rough on me so far unfortunately :( it’s not even Vegas at this point just a streak of bad luck.

I will apply to the places you mentioned thank you so much!"
vegaslocals,fhb9xrl,t1_fhangqu,1581437913.0,"I’m not really familiar with union jobs, I’m new here from Maryland and last time I lived here I was too young. I hear about them a lot and hear that they’re great, I just kind of don’t know what it means?

I’ve also heard it takes a while and you have to know the right people. If they’re as great as people say they are that’s a direction I’d be interested in moving in, but for the short term I need something else that I can start immediately.

Is there a particular thread I should read to learn about it?"
