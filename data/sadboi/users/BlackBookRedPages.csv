Me happy: thinking about ways to better improve by sleeping well, making sure I‚Äôm at work, doing good things on my own terms and for myself, making sure I get a mental health day to relax, and ensuring purchases I am making align with my needs and finances, etc. 
I think the distinction is the act of thoroughly thinking through what is occurring and why it‚Äôs occurring. I notice a key difference in my thought process when I‚Äôm happy vs when I‚Äôm hypomanic. Manic me throws all regards out the window and I feel like an addict searching for that instantaneous high from purchasing things, drinking until I pass out, and forcing the appreciation and attention of other people. Perhaps that‚Äôs just me. Less thinking and more impulsiveness is a sign that I‚Äôm manic of some sort.
