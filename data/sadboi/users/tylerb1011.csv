Anxiety,fplspk7,t3_fnz5n3,1588718737.0,"Sorry, I just need to vent really quick. So, it looks like my sister is going to be the first of us to break quarantine to go see her friend from school and my anxiety is starting to spiral that we‚Äôre all going to get it. I know at some point we‚Äôll eventually have to re-enter the world and I‚Äôve been on the side of wanting to get out myself, but now that‚Äôs someone in my house is actually going to do it, I‚Äôm freaking out.

I know I‚Äôm being over dramatic, I know I‚Äôm probably overthinking this waaaay too much. I just needed to get this off my chest, so thank you all for listening."
Anxiety,fpepda2,t3_fnz5n3,1588552102.0,"I‚Äôm a little disappointed in myself. I was doing so well today in trying to be positive, but something (and I can‚Äôt remember what) triggered my longing for when we used to go out to eat and I just sort of relapsed and regressed hard back to my old way of thinking. I‚Äôll just have to keep trying to get through this.

EDIT: I do realize that people can still go out to eat, but I can‚Äôt personally due to living with other people."
Anxiety,fp4v0ed,t3_fnz5n3,1588308100.0,"Sorry for the spam, I just had another thought I meant to get out there...and also sorry for the incoming negativity:

Anyone else have a lot of regret? Like, I think about all the stuff I missed out on (traveling, going to events, hanging out with people more, etc) and now I feel like I've taken those opportunities for granted now that they're off the table. I'm just sort of sitting here wishing I did more and I hope that I do have that opportunity to make up for lost time."

So, for now, at least I don't have those things to worry about."

So, per my previous post about finding something to look forward to: for all my American peeps, we‚Äôre getting another nationwide solar eclipse soon!! It‚Äôs not for another four years, but it does give me something to look forward to because I didn‚Äôt see the last one.

Best thing about a solar eclipse? The only thing covid can‚Äôt cancel!! That shit happens rain or shine!!!"
Anxiety,fopmbrj,t1_fopii77,1587965379.0,"Thank you so much for the kind words. I‚Äôm definitely hopeful that this will be over soon and this isn‚Äôt forever. It‚Äôs just been so hard to not believe otherwise give the echo chamber of negativity in my house and social circle. I understand their concerns but to hear my family go to make such apocalyptic conclusions just spikes my anxiety, even if I don‚Äôt necessarily agree with them. And given how scared they are of getting sick is putting the terrible thoughts in my head that if I so much as take one step outside, I‚Äôll be bringing it in and getting everyone severely ill. So, I need to try and abandon that line of thinking and I have been trying to work on that."
Anxiety,foph29q,t3_fnz5n3,1587961300.0,"Okay, sorry, but I need to vent/rant for just a sec:

&#x200B;

My mental health has just taken an absolute nose dive. I keep thinking I'm doing so well getting used to life now, but then I'll be reminded of things we used to do, usually from my family talking about how much they miss A, B, and C. Or I'll be hearing someone talk about how things will never go back to normal and then I'll just regress back to freaking out. I've really had next to nothing to look forward to right now, and yes I have been looking at all the good news and that really does help. But, then I keep thinking about how even if lockdowns are over, I might get sick and die or worse, I could get my family sick, and just resolve to accepting staying inside for the rest of my life. Right now, as for when/if things go back to normal, I'll just have to be pleasantly surprised and until then, keep busy and distracted and just wait that way.

Sorry for the negativity/spam, I just needed to air this out."
Anxiety,fopbrqm,t3_fnz5n3,1587957588.0,"I‚Äôve been bummed out by all the cancellations and I think I know why. In the grand scheme of things, yeah, they‚Äôre small things and relatively speaking there are worse things going on rn, but here‚Äôs the thing: when I was in school, I looked forward to winter break/summer/graduation, and now I‚Äôm basically working for the rest of my life and all these events gave me something to look forward to, and now I don‚Äôt really have that. I guess I‚Äôll just have to find something or make something else to look forward to."

Anxiety,fnwknd1,t1_fnwjsmd,1587320202.0,"Thank you for this. ‚ù§Ô∏è I definitely have held the same views a month ago and over that month, I‚Äôve seen plenty of stories about recoveries, treatments, info on the virus,restrictions being loosened or lifted altogether. Even the hardest hit countries like China, Italy, and the US are already rolling out, or at least discussing, plans to reopen.

We‚Äôre getting there. It‚Äôs been a long road, but it‚Äôll come to an end soon."
Anxiety,fnvgp37,t1_fnv7q9u,1587292646.0,"I hate it, too. I can‚Äôt take credit for this but someone said it basically implies we‚Äôve given up and have just decided this is life now, which is a terrible way to think (I‚Äôll admit at times I‚Äôve fallen into that way of thinking and try to stay out of that). There‚Äôs absolutely no way we‚Äôll go touchless for the rest of our lives."

I just wanted to say thank you to @Anistmows and everyone else who has been contributing to this thread. This time last month, I was super defeated, thinking this was going to go on for the rest of the year if not longer and being bombarded by news stories depicting this as end of days. But, this thread has put a lot of perspective into this situation and cleared up quite a bit of anxiety, especially because the posts here are reassuring statements backed up by legitimate stories and studies.

Things will be back to how we remember; we might even be in for a decent summer!
