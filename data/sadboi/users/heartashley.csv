Dishes, cutlery, pot, frying pan, knife set, cutting board, kitchen tools(spatulas etc), microwave, dish rack, dish soap, sponges, hand soap, toilet paper, kitchen towels(I don't like paper towel), cleaning spray, shower curtain and hooks

What I had already:
French press, kettle, cups, mixing bowls, a few other kitchen things like food, tea, coffee, tea.

I'm saving up for couch, new bed, etc. But those were what I bought right away and needed immediately, may have missed a few but that's generally it :) edit to add: I just moved 2 weeks ago!!! Of course you may not need full sets of dishes or knives but get what you need ofc."

As for your other questions, it'd be best to ask them directly when you give them your notice.

I lived in Austin previously but got paid more, and paid 800-900 for rent but could afford it.

You're definitely allowed to call people problematic, but the reasons you stated in another comment can be applied to the Try Guys too - are they problematic as well, or is it only people you find are cringey or annoying that are problematic?

Your opinion is definitely valid though and I see where you're coming from. Calling people problematic without looking at the others too seems a bit short sighted though."

In the end I said ""yeah, sure, I don't have a problem right, I'm fine I'm sure"" because they didn't believe me so maybe I was just overreacting? 

Anyway they soon found out I was being serious. At this point, if people joke about it, I just tell them to cut it out, or if they don't believe me, I tell them it doesn't matter if they do or don't since it doesn't change the facts. It's easier to ignore them dismissing you by knowing how it affects you, but also knowing you're doing something to change it.

We all make mistakes, but we learn from them too."

As for hotels, I don't think a lot (if any) will be open. I've seen people in other threads mention airbnb which might be your best bet.

As for quarantining, some States are stopping people at entry and depending on where you're coming from, having you sign something saying you'll quarantine for 14 days and there are fines if you don't kind of thing. Even if you didn't get stopped, this is something you should do, and something your new job should hopefully understand. I'd recommend reaching out to them immediately and asking.

Edit: honestly I'd recommend going through a few threads on this subreddit since there's been a bunch about moving during these times. That was how I decided what to do, and knew what to think about kind of thing."
