Lol what, nice straw man in order to paint your own very specific picture.

>CP3’s numbers such as WS/48 and PER are trending down as he ages... if he plays as many seasons as Stockton did, which he won’t cause he’s not nearly as durable (which obviously matters) that wouldn’t be the case. His stealsPG are the same as Stockton right now and he’s 34. Stockton played until he was 40

Alright my bad, I'll change my initial argument: CP3 is better than Stockton at literally every facet of basketball apart from not getting injured and longevity, which is the only point you've argued for in Stockton's case. And shooting efficiency, which I'll concede, but the slightly more efficient scoring doesn't really mean he's a better scorer with 5.4 less ppg. And again, when you're playing with Karl Malone there's much less of a scoring load on you, if he didn't play with Malone and had to shoulder more of a scoring load we'd likely see his efficiency drop. Stockton also led the league in steals twice and CP3 led the league in steals a record 6 times.

Crocus is on top of Reverse Mountain and therefore will interact with every crew entering the Grand Line (hmm, does this mean Roger somehow knew the Pirate King, Rayleigh is at Sabaody Archipelago, where every pirate will need to pass through to enter the New World from the Grand Line. 

So Scopper could be at the end of the Grand Line, possibly at Road Star or even Laugh Tale.

rockets,fgtls5f,t1_fgs1zy8,1581106264.0,"Here's an arrogant breakdown of my opinion I wrote in July 2019 lol, in short it comes down to our all time great offence not being affected too much by LAC's defence, and their offence won't be able to keep up with ours:

Why I think we should be the favourites this season:

Currently on one of my books in Australia, the odds for who’s going to win the chip this season is: LAC - $3.75, LAL - $5.5, Bucks $6.5, 76ers - $9, GSW - $12, Rockets - $13

The sixth best chance of winning the chip. Clippers lineup now looks like: PG - Pat Bev, SG - PG13, SF - Kawhi, PF - Trez? C - Zubac? Notable bench players being Lou Will, Shamet, Green, Temple… The only thing that worries me about this team is the perimeter defence, especially since that’s the only way we can create shots - but even then our whole philosophy is to get the switch and target the mismatch. In games where Kawhi and PG13 have been on the other side, they haven’t really been a huge factor on D since we get the switch most of the time (and they need to save energy for offence), and even when we don’t get the switch, Harden can still deal with them fairly easily a majority of times (he can still get locked down by them ofc, but he usually makes the right play).

When Kawhi went to Toronto, he went to an already established system, and his isolation was just another addition to the offence - another option readily available when ball movement or Lowry couldn’t create anything, as well as his defence. Nothing about his play forced the system to change drastically, apart from less ball movement plays in favour of Kawhi isolation plays. When PG13 went to OKC, he joined an established system of pretty much Russ iso + drive and kicks (to fairly poor 3pt shooters) and Russ PnR with Adams (but they barely use that). PG13 then became a replacement for most of the spot up shots from the fairly poor 3pt shooters and could take some of the iso plays that Russ was being forced to take all the time, so again, the system didn’t need to change. Instead of living and dying by Russ, PG13 could now be counted to create shots, so again, not a huge change in the system.

Now, apart from Lou Will/Trez PnR (and to be fair, they can spam them quite effectively on most bench units), they’ll have to create an entire new system apart from just having isolation/your turn, my turn offence with Kawhi and PG13. Don’t get me wrong, they’re great isolation players, especially Kawhi, but Harden is one of the best isolation players of all time, and unlike nephews who would tell you that Harden’s selfish isolation style is what keeps us from winning a chip, we actually had the 5th best offensive rating of all time last season, even with all the injuries we dealt with (last year’s GSW season is #1, 86-87 Lakers 2nd, 16-17 GSW 3rd and 91-92 Bulls 4th). Iirc, PG13’s isolation plays may not be that efficient, if anyone knows the points per possession that would be a good indication (could be wrong on this - I assume last year he could have had one of his best seasons in that department and been efficient in iso - but I feel he was best when spotting up or catch and shooting off Russ’s drive and kicks). I expect a lot of turnovers and mistakes that will be amplified come playoffs time.

PG13 and Kawhi aren’t known for their playmaking skills. Pat Bev is a nice passer, but also can’t run the entire offence himself. Lou Will provides even more passing off the bench and solid playmaking skills, but I’m not overly concerned that that can create an infallible system - I think they’ll mainly alternate isolation with Kawhi and PG13, and if it’s between their iso and our iso, I’ll take ours 10 out of 10 times (AND if CP3 can perform at an average level, at least some fraction of his former self, it’s a wrap imo).

Kawhi and PG13 are mainly isolation defenders as well, which favours us. What thwarts us the most is when a system with help defence is implemented (like GSW with Klay guarding him on ball and Draymond always ready to help), so Harden can be guarded not just by one person at a time, but by multiple people on the court at a time, and they can make the appropriate gambles when necessary (like to collapse on Harden’s drive and force someone else to to beat them).  If Clippers try to defend us man-to-man it should be a disaster for them."

Also with the ppg differential, since most of those games were won, we would obviously have a really good differential unless that one loss was HUGE. And some of those losses with Capela were at the beginning of the season and were huge losses.

The 3-pt FG% is actually interesting, as it would make sense that when we're not playing Capela we're playing 5-out, greatly increasing the spacing... but again, we have only 10 games of these to look at:

So for 3-4 of those 10 games we were around the average 38% for that sample, for 2 we were significantly above it (49% and 46.7%) and the other 4 we were significantly below it (30.4%, 31.0%, 31.4% and 34.1%). If it wasn't for those 2 outliers, one being against the Hawks (no offence lol) that percentage wouldn't look nearly as good. 

And we're also ignoring how that 34% with Capela is affected by the HUGE slump that Harden + most of the Rockets were in to start the season - Harden went 17/79 (21.5%) to start the season, and in around that same period Rockets were 105/347 (30.3%) I believe."

nba,ffsu1ik,t1_ffskb9c,1580192471.0," Until now, I hadn't experienced tears welling up in the eyes following the tragedy, only complete numbness - as if I'm frozen in time trying to process the information, or trying not to process it...

But seeing the video of Kobe introducing Gigi and Luka to each other broke me (if all the cutaway shots of Gigi and the family ecstatically cheering him on didn't do so already), and the tears immediately sprung into existence.

The way Kobe pauses his interaction with Luka, looks over at Gigi and embraces her with one arm - pulling her closer and drawing Luka's attention to her... the love, compassion and pride he has for her was palpable, and it felt like it was radiating and bursting out of the TV screen during that gentle embrace to pierce my consciousness with a horrible truth - the truth that this divine display of the love between a father and daughter, and the deep, personal connection and understanding that the two shared beyond their family bond, had been taken away from us.

In that moment, it isn't just Luka that is seeking validation and recognition from Kobe (even though Kobe has already given him that abundantly); Kobe as well wants Luka's recognition, but not for himself… In that moment he cares not for his basketball legacy, or how much the man in front of him thinks the world of him... He just wants that same man to notice and acknowledge the existence of Gigi - his true legacy, and not merely because she admires Luka, but mainly because Kobe admires her.

And Gigi... I was blown away by her maturity and character; she wasn't overly or even noticeably starstruck when meeting a huge idol of hers, and was completely professional in the exchange. She's most likely received some informal publicity training/tips - I would assume by Kobe himself (he loved spending time and sharing his wisdom with her).

Which makes the whole exchange and the thought of Kobe being just as invested in his daughter's life as he was in his own, and preparing Gigi for her future in almost every way possible (basketball itself, how to handle the media, countless life lessons, etc.) even more heartfelt, yet all the more heartbreaking."

nba,ffso4bw,t1_ffsgy0e,1580186800.0,">but damn we really got robbed of 40 years of “old man” Kobe. 

Bruh... I had made my peace with it and was more celebrating his life and achievements and legacy rather than mourning his passing (still lying in bed, feeling numb as fuck and just absorbing all the outpour of love and appreciation for him as if that's somehow helping lmao) but this just made me feel this shit different... the cool wise old guy that wrecked shit back in the day... only it wouldn't be an exaggerated caricature and would be 100% legit, it would be that exact archetype except real and 100x more cool, wise and badass :( still tho, 40 years of greatness, I'm not gonna complain - it's what he would have wanted and I believe it's the mentality he had too. Instead of lying around mourning, live your life fully with your head high to respect their life and legacy and cherish the positivity they brought to the world."

So since Denjiro is from Wano, that's another point to the theory aside from 'they look alike'.
