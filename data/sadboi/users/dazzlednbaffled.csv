Once you two are living apart, you won’t ever live together again. It doesn’t make sense at this point to do something so drastic. Definitely other measures and boundaries can be taken to encourage independence. 

And on the flip side, why would you want to stay with someone who doesn’t want to live with you? Just mull that over in your head. How could you have a whole, integrated life with someone who doesn’t want to live together? How can the relationship even move forward logically if that’s the case? 

You two live apart for ??? say a few months. Things are good and then you move back in. Then it’s hard again. You want to be one of those couples that never lives together but is married? Sure, go this route. 

But it sounds to me like he wants to break up and is too scared to commit to it. Instead he asks you for space and living apar so he can essentially be single whenever you aren’t there.

sex,fr3hg6u,t3_gmgbdc,1589857496.0,"Herpes is lifelong. Once you got it, it’s forever. The symptoms (outbreaks) may decrease over time and become more manageable, but it *never* goes away. 

Herpes can transmit it to anybody via viral shedding, whether there’s an active outbreak or not. So if you have it, you can and will give it eventually.  There is medication (antivirals) to reduce outbreaks and reduce transmission risk, but it’s always there. 

Many people have asymptomatic herpes, which means they just carry the virus but don’t ever express it (outbreak). They just give it to whoever, never knowing what they’re doing. 

Don’t determine your status by the status of your partner. You could have it and just gotten lucky to not transmit it yet. You could have it and given it to her and both be by asymptomatic. 

It could be a prank, but just go get tested. Herpes shows up in the blood by IGG and IGM measures. Research more on this, but it’s totally possible to find out if you have it without experiencing an outbreak. 

Herpes can kill infants, especially passing thru the birth canal, so if you ever wanna have kids with your fiancé, find out now how risky that can be (natural childbirth during an outbreak). Just find out if you have it, that’s the first step.

To answer a question that you keep asking in your replies, there is a way to handle this that could have gotten you the results you wanted and saved this other girl some pointed pain. 

And that is that it’s not about *her*. This is 100% about you and your inability to hold firm boundaries (and possibly also about your attachment style of being avoidant when it comes to emotions/vulnerability). 

For example, if she was constantly complaining about a guy, you could have said “friend, I understand that you are frustrated about your situation. I am trying to hold space for your emotions as much as I can. However, I’m finding myself feeling very emotionally drained by this topic and moving forward, I won’t be engaging in conversation about it. ”  Then you would just... not talk to her about it. She can be angry about that or upset or whatever, but you don’t bend on the boundary after that. If she can’t respect it and repeatedly tries to violate it, then you end the relationship. 

You can’t change anyone else’s behaviour but you can take responsibility for your own boundaries or lack thereof. 

I think there’s a lot of ways you could reflect on this situation. I agree with another commenter that the friendship has run its course and that’s okay. I believe it would be helpful for you to get into counselling to have some introspection about your inability to hold space for your friends, your lack of firm boundaries, and the trivializing of their problems.

sex,fpugt2j,t3_gfm7qb,1588912527.0,"Ugh. I have been there, as a woman. It can be very frustrating. Sex is a vulnerable activity and that “letting go” in order to orgasm can be hard sometimes. 

Obviously you two have spoken about this and it makes sense that you *want* her to cum. And she obviously wants to, too. But I can see how she would feel some type of pressure, both from herself and from you. (Not saying you’re pushy or whatever)

It might be helpful to reframe sex. Ask her what she enjoys most about it beyond orgasming and what you can do to make a sexual encounter pleasurable without the orgasm. For me personally, I don’t need to orgasm every time. Would it be awesome to do so? Absolutely. Is it necessary? No. There’s a lot of pleasure (for me) in PIV from certain angles and the intimacy in general. With the right person, it doesn’t matter if I cum or not. Not to me, anyways. 

And I think if you work with her to shift the conversation from “how can we get you to orgasm every time” to “how can we work to get you to enjoy the sex, whether or not you orgasm” may be a good idea. It can be freeing, in a sense. 

People often see sex as a goal oriented activity with orgasm being what you’re working to get. But that doesn’t need to be the case, by any means. And it’s no reflection on either of you if orgasm isn’t the be all end all every time. 

Also introducing other standalone sex, like just oral for her for example, could be helpful. 

I don’t think this is worthy of breaking up, unless one or both of you is not willing to work with the other and be open enough in the ways that need be. Or the sex itself is just unfulfilling. 

It’s also worth saying that it could be unrelated to you. Most times I’ve cried during sex or couldn’t cum,  it’s more to do with personal stress or relationship-focused stress than the specific stress of *not* being able to cum. I say that because I know (like ur gf probably knows) how to get myself off very quickly. It’s when my mind is clouded due to other reasons that I struggle. And I don’t want to speak for her, but I wonder if it’s similar for her."

It could be your lack of planning, or not helping her out enough, or your inconsistency. There’s also a slight chance she doesn’t actually like sex and has learned she’s asexual to some degree. 

I think your best course of action is to get into sex therapy as a couple and explore why she’s not into it. There 100% has to be a reason why... is she too tired? Is she tired because she works all day and takes care of the house and cooks you dinner and then does the dishes and then doesn’t want to be also responsible for the initiation of sex?

Just sounds like a big disconnect that you need to bridge. And you do that by reflection and therapy.

relationships,fpmdpd3,t1_fpmbieh,1588730825.0,"It sounds like you’re stuck in that middle space of knowing what you meant but being betrayed by your tone, which puts your inner feelings (of defensiveness, hurt, shock, etc) on display. 

The best tone is an unaroused tone. Meaning, you don’t engage when you’re heated. You have to learn to respectfully step away from a conversation when you’re triggered and learn to ground yourself when you step away. 


That takes time and practice. I would encourage you to start seeing a therapist to help you deconstruct your triggers, practice speaking without a tone, having firm and reinforced boundaries, and how to disengage from a tense and conflicted moment. 

Ultimately, the issue isn’t people “misunderstanding” you - it’s that you have little control over your automatic reactions. When you (or anyone, really) get triggered, you instantly move into fight, flight, or freeze. And it takes a lot of conscious awareness to stay present and work through that; that’s why a therapist will help. 

It’s not an easy solution and it’s not something anyone else can or will do for you. You have to learn to be less.. reactive. And more responsive. That was the balancing act I found that most helped me. And I couldn’t have done that without a lot of introspection and therapy guided reflection.

Edit: also, if you hurt someone with your tone and they feel a certain way, you should apologize. If you find people are talking in circles with you over what you’ve said to them, it’s because they take issue with it or how it was said. And it’s on you, as a reasonable and accountable adult, to consider what and how you said it and apologize. 

Ex: Mom, you’re right. That did sound ungrateful of me. I didn’t mean to imply that you didn’t do the best you could with what you had at the time and I am thankful for everything you’ve done for me.

On top of tone, there is a lot that body language says and communicates to others. I used to hear a lot that I was rude and appeared bored by people talking to me. It wasn’t until a while later that someone told me I rolled my eyes once when she was talking and I swore that I hadn’t, that I realized my face makes expressions automatically and *I don’t register them.* I didn’t remember rolling my eyes, but of course, if someone rolled their eyes at me, I’d consider them condescending as well. 

It has taken a lot of time and awareness but it has helped me tremendously to reign in my tone, facial, and body expressions. I think this is probably what you’re dealing with and I would encourage you to really observe yourself, without judgement, in conversation, even if you have to get creative to do so (record an interaction, for example). 

Once you can view what you’re saying and doing from an outsiders perspective then you’ll be able to fix what’s happening.

Her values obviously are not the same as ours. 

With cheating, people tend to shoot the messenger. I think your best course of action is to remove yourself from the situation and distance yourself from this friend.

We can only control ourselves. And it’s better to be less of a friend to someone who doesn’t align in values and morals than to force yourself to stay in an awkward situation."

I’m in a sort of similar spot in the sense that I have my first male therapist. And sex is like, something I have no issue talking about and is a frequent enough thing in my life to matter in the context of my problems. So far, I’ve just made passing comments on it and treated him like he’s like my other therapists. He hasn’t expressed discomfort and I’m trusting that he’s able to be fine

I think they’re trained to be professional and unless you get really graphic (like explaining in depth how you best like it) then it should be fine. You’re not talking so much about masturbating as the feelings surrounding it, before and after. And those are fair game, cuz they’re emotions."

TalkTherapy,foy6eu1,t1_fox8a6c,1588166365.0,"No, the point is not to continue forever. The point is to learn coping mechanisms that are healthy and get to a point where you can employ them regularly on your own. 

Also, that’s literally a therapists job. To be somebody’s springboard. Lol. Yes, that’s part of what somebody would want in therapy.. an unbiased listening ear. 

It’s okay that you don’t understand it. You don’t seem mentally ill and the concept doesn’t make sense to you.  That’s great, you don’t need it. But don’t pass judgement, even passively, on people that do need it and may need it longer than a few sessions. 

It’s not as easy for most people. Sometimes it can take years of therapy to peel back layers and layers of shame and self loathing to get to the root of a problem. Sometimes a therapist is the only safe person a person has. 

Either way, yes eventually it will likely end. Unless there’s a disorder that needs more consistency. In that case, therapy sessions scale up or down. Sometimes you go once or twice a week for a while and then scale
back to once a month while you’re doing better. Then it can move it once every couple weeks while you need more support. It’s always shifting for most people.

Edit: if it helps, think of it like exercise. Your whole life you need to exercise (having a safe, supportive person to lean on), because it’s good for you. But how often you go and what you do depends on your goals. If you’re trying to lose weight, you go more often. If you’re in maintenance mode, you go less. If you are trying to gain muscle, you go either more or less but what you do during your session changes. Maybe that will help you get the gist of it."
TalkTherapy,fox2ufb,t1_fox2hhf,1588132751.0,"The whole point of therapy is to create a safe environment with a safe person. And to practice having a safe and ethical relationship with someone. 

Counterintuitive seems like the wrong word.. mostly because the transference of emotions is usually out of control of the patient. And if there is any boundary’s crossed, the patient will often be referred out by the therapist. 

Idk what you mean by why don’t people say anything."
TalkTherapy,fox2cr1,t3_ga1xqa,1588132423.0,"There’s a lot of emotional transference that happens in therapy.

Absolutely nothing anyone does is our own fault. We contribute to situations and we are responsible *to* other people to treat them respectfully and with dignity, but how they react, behave, speak, and act is up to them. And however the act is often a reflection of whatever is going on with themselves and how they treat themselves. 

As an example, if you’re dealing with someone who is very critical and judgement, dollars to donuts, they are cutting themselves down for everything they’re doing. And that hasn’t got a thing to do with you."

She can stay away. But you won’t let her. You’re breadcrumbing this poor girl because she gives you all the benefits and none of the drawbacks. 

If it helps to think of it this way,.... you loved your ex that cheated on you. Maybe you stayed with them after they did it the first time. Or the second. Or the third. You believed her when she said it was a mistake and that it wouldn’t happen again. But it did. But you still loved her. It shattered your heart - at some point, you looked at her and thought, *why won’t she just break up with me? Why does she want to be with me just to cheat on me?? She loves me enough to be with me but not enough to not cheat? What am I doing wrong?*

And that way you felt is how you make this girl feel ***all the time***

You’ve become the villain you paint/ed your ex to be. You’re just as selfish (and cruel and callous) as your cheating ex, but you think you’re not. 

Sometimes we have to be the strong one for people who can’t be. End it and don’t let her come back. If she tries, ignore her, be curt and firm and don’t even try to be friends. 

My ex did this to me and it hurt me immensely at first but years later I can see the kindness  he did me. Idve always come back to him. I couldn’t be strong enough but he could and even though we’ve never spoken after that last break up, I am very grateful to him for his choice to be absolutely done with a toxic relationship."
