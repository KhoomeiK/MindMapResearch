AusFinance,fq91gwd,t1_fq90i1w,1589182234.0,"I think the report is great, I just don't understand why you are so confident we will bounce back to nearing lockdown again. It looks like we've chosen option 2, controlled adaptation, which the report says is a slightly higher number of cases/deaths and a possible (i.e. not at all certain) risk of surge. However, we have extensive testing and contact tracing in place as advised in the report, far more than many other countries.

We're in a really good position to make this tradeoff with minimal impact. It's not just about soulless politicians not caring about death. The economy, our mental health, and our day-to-day life are all valid factors too, and I think most Australians would be willing to take that risk of a mild uptake (which by all factors I see should be mild) to start getting our day-to-day life back."

AusFinance,fq8zysl,t1_fq8et0g,1589180765.0,"The curve flattened in Australia ages ago. We are in a much better position than the rest of the world. Very few people are infected right now and cases are barely increasing.

If we were in the U.S. this would be a different story, but with our borders closed and case numbers low, the scenario you're describing just isn't that huge a risk anymore. Yes, we should still be more cautious, but there is no scientific reason to be so pessimistic about our path to recovery right now."
BPD,fppuzec,t3_gejk6d,1588809677.0,"My wife has BPD and we‚Äôve had so many pointless fights like this. BPD does make some issues feel larger/more intense than they need to be, but the flip side is, it makes it harder for me as a husband to self reflect on what I can do better. Humans aren‚Äôt great at taking responsibility already, so having BPD there as a known issue makes it even harder, because it‚Äôs so easy to just see BPD as the problem with everything.

My wife and I had marriage counselling which I highly recommend to anyone. But one of the best things we learned was ‚Äúpeople care more about being heard than being agreed with‚Äù. So we focus on validation rather than blame. Figuring out the one single person who is at fault never helps, and is rarely true anyway, it‚Äôs all just cause and effect.

If I say something that upsets my wife, I almost never intend to do it, but I validate her experience. ‚ÄúIt must have felt terrible that you thought I was criticising you. That wouldn‚Äôt feel good. I‚Äôm sorry it came off that way.‚Äù And at the same time, she validates me. ‚ÄúIt must suck to feel like I‚Äôm just blowing up at you out of nowhere all the time. I‚Äôm sorry it feels like a roller coaster.‚Äù

Validating doesn‚Äôt mean you agree with the others way of seeing things, it just means you recognise the other persons experience, and that‚Äôs all we actually care about. It takes a HUGE weight off both of our shoulders, to feel understood. Things instantly deescalate and we come to a resolution quickly.

It‚Äôs not popular advice on here, but the fact is partners of someone with BPD want validation too. It can be a roller coaster ride for us, and nobody wants to feel like their partner just doesn‚Äôt care about their struggle, BPD or not.

It‚Äôs not nice to hear that your husband thinks you‚Äôre sad, and it must hurt you so deeply after all the effort you‚Äôve put in, but it‚Äôs also not cruel of him to feel that way. He probably wants to be seen, for you to know that sometimes the intensity can be a lot to deal with and feels overwhelming.

He also needs to validate your experience. You were simply reacting to a bug in the house, and you feel hurt because it feels like everything gets pinned on your BPD, when you want him to instead listen to the real underlying concerns.

Try to turn inward and validate each other‚Äôs experiences, then go from there. And over time try to unlearn the habit of figuring out who is right and who is wrong (it took us a couple of years and we still struggle sometimes)

My wife learned certain techniques in therapy like breathing exercises when she is feeling flooded and time outs. If I gently mention BPD might be playing a role, or suggest she try one of those techniques, and she does use them, yes, it makes things better.

The flip side to the OP‚Äôs point is that if you just always believe you‚Äôre being gaslit and BPD plays no part, then you‚Äôll just do nothing, because your partner is the one who is ‚Äúwrong‚Äù. That‚Äôs not fair or enjoyable for your partner.

In any relationship, BPD or not, both partners should be looking to see what they themselves can do to better the situation.
