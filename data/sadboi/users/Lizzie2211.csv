Psychic,f7ca9g1,t3_dvf0p1,1573587846.0,"It can vary, some mild hallucinations like smelling something for a few seconds or thinking it's raining outside when it's not. If it continues you could have hallucinations of people, hear voices or actually experience delusions. You could also get hypomanic and stress could cause hallucinations. Not every hallucination will have to be negative though even though as a symptom its not good."

precognition,f1f6n83,t1_f1f3oab,1569437936.0,"Ive had deja vu which hasnt been from dreams and deja reve from dreams.

I could give examples of my deja reves the ones that have already manifested.

In 2006 i had a quick dream of me walking towards some traffic lights with someone i didnt know at the time. I heard a man talking about a pigeon. When it happened in 2012 same thing happened same man going on about a pigeon. With deja reve thats where the fleeting sensation comes over me with a wavey sensation.

Again in 2006 i had a dream which was blue and white of my dads side the family at the front door and they never came round most of the time so it was strange. 2 weeks later i came out of hospital and they were stood there same positions.

I had a dream in 2011 of my boyfriend running down a street. I woke up upset and thought he was running from me. Just before it happened i had deja vu when he was talking to me. Then the deja reve when he ran off because he had to get back to college. I felt upset, that happened in 2012.

I had one of my dad standing in the front room asking if id be alright. This dream was very saturated in color.this was in 2013 and it happened 3 days later. This is the only dream that i knew was precognitive prior i told people beforehand too.

Then in 2008 i had a dream one school day in the dream i had thoughts in my head. In this dream my dr who was still my dr at the time was in the background and just before i woke up in the dream i heard ""its dr (their name) you fucking bitch. I woke up a bit confused but didnt think anything of. Then in 2018 (i had moved 8 years before) i am standing in my local pub outside drinking my drink and staring into space. I hear someone behind me but didnt know i was being spoken to. The next minute i start feeling tense and then a man behind me shouts angrily"" its dr (their name) you fucking bitch!"" he stormed off and i muttered fuck off back at him. I.got upset and went and left from the back of the pub. When that happened i got the fleeting wavey deja vu and realised it was from an old dream from when he was still one of my drs. I had moved away from the old area hadnt seen him since id moved and it was strange how he just appeared."
Thoughts,f1esyxb,t1_f1es0g8,1569429570.0,Well the person that pops in my head is someone i left a good impression on but it wasnt a personal relationship and because of that being on a more professional level and the job they are in they cant go adding people online as it would cross the boundries. So even if i could add them on anything they probably would have to decline. It would be nice to know how they are and say hello but chances of bumping into them are slim. Having said this i saw one of their colleuges out of the blue who was rude to me because i was staring into space not noticing he was trying to talk to me which was shocking and unprofessional.
precognition,f1ejuzc,t1_f1ehwqe,1569423882.0,Yeah i think the one i saw is good looking too. I get the same with the face popping to mind. The only detail that i cant remember from vision is the type of car. For sanity i hope its someone. I mean i dont dream in accents and this was local to me. Im in england so the place im from isnt far from where i am and in this region people sound the same mainly in the same county. Sounded local to my old area and this one. Nor in dreams do i have people directly talking to me like that.
Thoughts,f1e4hjm,t1_f1e3uv5,1569412438.0,well in my case i cant really because of their adding friend settings and they probably couldn't add me even if they wanted to. i don't use facebook anymore anyway.
Thoughts,f17bdq4,t3_d7n4c1,1569240114.0,I see 1111 44 and 22 mostly I don't know why either. It stopped for a while then came back for the past few months. Looked it up regarding angel numbers but they all seem to say the same thing.

Thoughts,f03kr17,t1_f022ujl,1568358668.0,"Yeah or they might stick around only to say they are sorry to hear something then after that ignore you but others actually stay.

I've formed a slight complex in the last few months because when I told ones that were supposed to be caring people I was pregnant I got things like ""congrats on the little one"" ""oh I'm so sorry"" then anything else I said like hi they ignored. Others have not even commented and continued to ignore since. One friend after I got pregnant was talking to me and everything then ignored me for months claiming they was still my friend but then when I rang a few weeks ago muted the phone call on me! So I've completely got rid and won't even use Facebook anymore or make a new account even though I've said this before. Then one friend met me through this friend and I met her for the first time about a month ago and since that day she's completely ignored me. Probably just didn't like me once she actually met me. The list goes on but it's all happened within the last few months to year I could understand if there were arguments or confrontations but no. Some claimed they'd never ignore people and what have they done, somewhat hypocritical."
questions,ezzv3vx,t3_d2up8v,1568293376.0,"I think the same thoughts everyday about the same people past events etc. It's annoying and needs to be cancelled out by more things more relevant to my present time. Like I keep thinking of someone I've not seen in years and can't really talk to them or anything and I don't see why my mind needs to keep thinking of someone I'm not likely to see again.

I think life is worth living if we just continue doing things we love doing whatever than might be if things are possible."
DreamInterpretation,ezal0fk,t1_ez5ho6k,1567803321.0,Yeah I didn't know the man in the shed nightmare though I felt like I did. I always find my nightmares though rare tend to happen just as I'm about to wake up.
Thoughts,ezakkpm,t1_ezaiz4d,1567803128.0,"College was a few years ago now as I say I'm now 27 and have done some courses in mid twenties which the one from school didn't. He started blanking and ignoring around 2014 face to face when I said hello after talking on Facebook but that was 4 years before he started blocking me when he realised I'd gone off it on gone back on more recently, he must have a serious grudge though its obvious he has a complex with me specifically if he has to block someone dispite not hearing from them or contacting them in 4 years the minute a profile pops up on a friends friendlist or people you may know. It pops into my head quite a bit at night.

Yes I'm OK most of the time playing keyboard spending time with the friends who have not disappeared and got rid of Facebook, I've said it in the past but I will never ever go on it again now.

Probably is bad luck I'm a person who tends to prefer friends to family so it's a bit worrying when that happens and makes me question if anyone is really that important. Thanks for your kind reply."

precognition,ewittwi,t3_coe1rr,1565456601.0,"Mine are usually a few seconds also mine have happened days weeks and months later one even happened years later. I think they can mean nothing. I had a suspected precognitive dream last year and it had my doctor in and this young stranger. The stranger says ""hello Elizabeth"" giggling and had my local accent and not seen him before, I hope it was precognitive otherwise I'm going insane. I had a vision with the same guy in that was like I was in a different environment for a few seconds and was a still frame image.he appeared to be on a roundabout in a car grinning at nighttime and he looked very HD and realistic but no never seen the guy.

With my precognitive dreams they can vary in appearance some are wavey and above my head, some shakey, some saturated I even had one when I was 15 that was blue and white for some reason but when it happened it was obviously in color. I don't get them very often which I've noticed other people say in the replies. The last definite precognitive dream I had was in 2013 that happened 3 days later. Since then I've not had any play out. I'm now 27 the first notable one was 15 so I only had a few between 15 and 21.

Yes you could keep a dream journal I've given up with mine more recently as my dreams have been stupid in the past week or so and can't be bothered to type them in my phone."
Psychic,ewhqvy2,t3_co3qwc,1565418092.0,"Some reading can be shockingly accurate, I used to ring phone ones but kept wasting credit so stopped. Like one told me id meet a new friend gave her name straight away but told me I hadn't met her yet. I met her a few months after.

I know people on reddit do free readings but I find when you politely request one they never get back to you. You give them your name date of birth etc then don't seem to reply back it's like they just want your information not sure if that's happened to anyone else so I'm not wary of free ones on here."
Psychic,ewg1ihw,t1_ewg0o17,1565371840.0,"I didn't have the visions til last year when a few things were going on in my life. A few months before the vision with the stranger in I had this dream he was in and he looked like a real person not distorted dream character. So I was doing whatever I was doing then it was like I was in a different environment looking through my eyes at the HD still frame clip of the same guy driving around a roundabout at nighttime as it was dark and grinning. Never seen him before he looks like a real person I wish we could take photos of what we see in our heads lol. In the dream he was in I can't be bothered to type the whole dream but in the dream he was standing with my Dr and saying ""hello Elizabeth"" and giggling and I'm standing there not quite understanding. The visual of it could be precognitive though not 100 percent sure. If youd like to talk more about it you can message me if you like"
Psychic,ewfycow,t3_co0ub4,1565369935.0,"I've had precognitive dreams, synchronisity for example someone popping to my head then they turn up stuff like that. I've had flash precognition. I've had these ""visions"" that was like being in a different environment looking through my eyes, one of which was of a guy that was in a dream I had that may have been a precognitive one despite waiting to see if it manifests. With me these things have happened at random without me being in active practice and at times where I was too young to know what the terms for some of the experiences were.

Psychic,evfqz26,t1_evfqbjh,1564499947.0,"I do note them down in my phone, I had one last night of this crazy women that lives down the road. She was walking down the ginnel wearing a pink t shirt and shorts but for some reason didn't have her poodle with her. I don't think this man would be a husband, already got my partner but it's a question of wheither he's going to be a personal or professional relationship. Or what significance he is. For my sanity and validation I'd like it to manifest so I can say to myself oh yeah so it was precognitive."
Psychic,evfq9lh,t1_evfphxq,1564499635.0,"Thanks in glad you know what I'm trying to explain, I think with the still frame or snapshot ones where your there can probably happen at any point. I wish it would just hurry up and happen, I had that when I was 26 and I'm now 27 and if it was precognitive that I don't have to wait a long time. I have no way of finding out if the man is genuinely a real living person only know the accent and that he obviously drives and some connection to the doc possibly. With precognition dreams I know they can happen at any point also but most the time it's been months later a few days or two weeks, one case was 6 years."
Psychic,evfkglg,t1_evfhdna,1564497091.0,"I've had a few precognitive dreams myself the most memorable ones are from when I was 15 + the last one to play out within 3 days of dreaming it was when I'd just turned 22. Since then I've one that appeared precognitive in nature which I've mentioned many times but il give detail.

Last spring I was sleeping and didn't get up til around 8.i started off having a nice normal dream where I was sat at a table drinking a cup of tea. Then the dream turned more into a precognitive visual, I'm in a room with a brown wall, I'm by myself and then my current Dr walks up to me from the left and then this young unknown man from the right. The young man is looking at me with a grin on his face and his arms folded. He then says ""hello Elizabeth"" in my local accent and then giggles with my Dr. The dream was slightly shakey but in detail without distortion. Then it went into a screen above my head which has happened with other precogs. I'm standing there wondering why they are laughing feeling hot and nervous but not saying anything. The Dr has a giggling manner in real life sometimes. Then I woke up. The strange thing is the thoughts going round in my head during the dream are similar to my thoughts now a year later. During the dream I had a sense it was real life and felt a bit of deja vu. In the dream I knew the guy but in real life I'm pretty sure I don't. Then it gets weirder because the visions I mentioned where your in another environment happened months after and the same guy was in it! He appeared to be driving on a roundabout and grinning from the drivers seat. He looked very HD exactly like a real looking person, it was a still frame and wasn't moving. If I could take a photo from my brain to show how realistic he looked I would. Unfortunately I have no validation it's a real man as of yet and its errie. I hope it is someone out there in the local area in some form of existence 
, he looked early 30s so a few years older. I don't know what that dream was about. The dream only lasted seconds like most precogs do. 

I had a vision minds eye type last summer of a still frame of a friend crying and getting thoughts of them dying I just thought I was going delusional at the time. I saw them a month ago and now in the last week or so I hear they are now very ill and then that made me think of that vision so that's unnerving."
Psychic,evf5n8m,t3_cjpg7p,1564489172.0,"I can relate, I've had hypomanic episodes briefly aswell. When they happened it was like spiritual awakening. I had an increase in precogniton more so than if I was in the right frame of mind. I got creative alongside the normal symptoms of hypomania that was bad enough. It got scary though as someone kept popping to my mind I'd not seen in year and they turned up somewhere I was one afternoon and ended up being rude to me then had a deja vu when it happened. I'm focal epileptic also. I've had precognitive dreams but not during any mania just at normal random times and stages in my life. You can message me about this if you like. I'm 27.

Regarding souls I don't know what to say other than look at things that make you happy and try to look after yourself. Look inside your mind and see if you need to resolve anything."
friendship,ev28gsq,t1_ev25kib,1564172325.0,"Yeah the lack of emotion can be annoying, I mean I know I mentioned to the person I misscarried but it could of been anything like if I were to say someone else had died or has cancer he would of still been like ""please stop messaging me, I have absolutely no interest in speaking to you"" then probably thinking why is she even sending me a message. I just make fun of him in my mind cheers me up abit though that's not really mature it's better than me getting irritated about it. I guess I was pissed off that he didn't even care i misscarred I know not everyone does or will but regarding no emotion theres an example. I hope if I do bump into him in particular I can just look at him walking past like a stranger with no emotion. Now the one who ignored me and my friend I'm less likely to bump into as he lives many miles away but going to see her next week it would be funny if we did bump into him but it's a very big city.

Yeah I hate that when you are trying to talk to someone and they blank you and talk to everyone else. I never do that but there was one time last year I was outside a pub in my area drinking my drink and then I hear someone talking but didn't register I was being spoken to like I was staring into nowhere and then a person behind me shouts ""it's Dr (their name) you fucking bitch!"" then I muttered fuck off back at him while experiencing a deja vu. It was a former Dr from where I used to live. I use that as an example because that could of been seen as me being deliberately ignorant which I would hate but I never deliberately ignore face to face. I don't know why someone would get an idea you'd make a rumor up about them unless it was someone who was nasty to someone regularly."
friendship,ev14hon,t1_eu8c3xp,1564152118.0,"I was thinking to myself how the person has no interest in speaking to me or commenting on anything that's happened to me and yet on his Facebook everything he posts is public like telling the world how his dogs died or that he's got ibs it's like he has no interest in one person but likes everyone to see and comment on his life. Also on the top of his page ""quotes vine daily"" if that's not one dimensional I don't know what is. 

I understand what you mean about them thinking people are better than them, I also think they actually think they are better than others like ""oh I'm so successful my job is so much better"""
Psychic,euw8lij,t1_euw6j3n,1564072223.0,"No not in that dream, I mean I was already aware of my doc and his name but this man didn't say his other than greeting me the only name mentioned was my own. So I can't try googling a name which I would of done if it was said. I don't tend to dream of names being mentioned in any dreams usually and not all of my dreams have any sound. There have been other people saying there's a strong possibility its a real person as I say it would be worrying if it isn't with the amount of detail."
Psychic,euw5g0y,t1_euw445f,1564070740.0,"I haven't seen this guy yet though, I spose if it was a vision they can happen at any point. With flash precognition I know that happens seconds later and precognitive dreams can also happen at any point. I describe it as absence seizure because I had started to get them last year and it's the nearest thing to example. I can't say ive lost any time during seeing these images as I was by myself and not watching or doing anything in particular, like let's say it I was to just stare at a blank wall during then after I wouldn't know because nothings moved if that makes sense or I'm not looking at a clock.

Regarding an actual absence seizure I've been told I'm not the first to know when I had one like the loss of time etc.

That sounds awful what happened to your friend I have seen posts where people say they can impair daily life if they happen often.

I start thinking about the man as though he's a living person, I mean during the dream he was talking with my accent and I don't tend to dream of accents anyway, if I had a photo in my brain to show I would show how realistic he looked in comparison to regular dream characters. It's happened to other people where they've later met people so I hope its sooner rather than later for validation."

Psychic,euuuuwd,t1_eur6ewi,1564051062.0,"Well funny story il share, I've had precognitive dreams like a lot of people that ended up happening and then not for a while. Last year I had this dream that started off like a normal dream and went into the characteristics of past precogs. I was standing in a room by myself and then my doc walks up to me from the left and this unknown young man from the right. They stop in the middle, the young man has his arms folded and says in my local accent ""hello Elizabeth"" grins and starts giggling with my doc. In the dream I remember feeling like what are they laughing at not quite understanding and feeling hot sensations like nervousness. My doc looked realistic wearing a purple t shirt you know mens work clothes and the stranger wearing black jacket white t shirt etc, he looked 30s had black hair green eyes probably like 5ft 7. Then they both start laughing together, not maliciously more in a greeting way. The doc has a giggling manner in real life in appointments sometimes anyway. I don't know who this unknown man is but in the dream it was realistic like thoughts were in my head etc. In the dream I knew who he was but obviously in waking life I dont and have no current validation it's a real person. They both looked too real to be regular normal distorted dream characters. Wheither it's a precog I don't know.

Then while awake a few months after I have a ""vision"" where its like your elsewhere for a few seconds and your seeing a scene through your eyes. I had a clear HD still frame of the same dream guy in a car on a roundabout at what appeared to be evening as it was dark. He was grinning again, obviously the vision was like eye vision so he was clear as day in all features. Then I went back to normal, precognitive or the mind I don't know but its perplexing if my mind is that creative....i hope its a real person. These visions kept happening I like to describe it as like an absence seizure but it's filled with a clip or image, no idea what my body does at these visions wheither I'm zoned out or what. I havent had it in months so it might of been a phase. A lot was going on anyway, last summer was madness.

But to answer your question the meditating  images vary, from blurry images to one that hurt between my eyes as they are shown too fast and saturated, one of which happened like a precognition dream would. I don't get it often I have blips of these abilities then it closes for a while. So not a lot to say recently."

Then the last precognitive dream I had that happened 3 days later I woke up just knowing it was a precognitive dream. I then went onto a forum at the time and explained the dream, I knew what it was regarding while dreaming which helped me realise. That particular dream was fuzzy and saturated and the usual only lasting seconds.

I've had a suspected precognitive dream last year which I've noted, but won't know if it is unless it happens.

I think documenting is a good idea."

Hypomania is milder than a full mania which you can get with bipolar you can also get hypomania with bipolar. I had to block one person for trying to claim I was wasting there time saying how can you have hypomania without bipolar, I might not be a hundred percent correct but they need to do there homework instead of being rude. Makes me laugh how some people come onto someone else's thread and start acting all high and mighty,no one made them click on it the only person wasting their time is themselves."
questions,eug5trl,t1_eug409z,1563800772.0,"Oh it does happen occasionally, I mean when your not tall you get remarks off people but overall it's just shouting things at me or people of my height or whatever I don't tend to get some random foreigner being like that though. I wouldn't say I handle it well to be honest with you I feel a bit embarrassed about something a few months ago. Some kids were shouting things at me and I more or less lost it shouting back, I'd had a misscarrage not long before that and because intolerant and for some reason I ended up blurting I've had a fucking miscarriage fuck off at them, not that it has anything to do with them, don't think they laughed at it just continued to shout things. Then some bloke was asking if I was alright and said the one saying it all was the shorter than the other boys. I was overally stressed anyway and when people are going on and on it makes anyone snap."
questions,euftnu9,t1_eu9kpbe,1563790346.0,"It wasn't a conversation in this instance it was asking a personal question on my physical appearance and asking why I'm so short in a rude way,which had nothing to do with me giving him directions and came out of nowhere. It wasn't the fact he asked my age but the fact he was asking because of something that is clearly non of his business and that isn't my fault. He was asking in a making fun confused hostile sort of way if that makes sense and it pissed me off at the time especially as I'd just tried to be helpful. I should just learn to be deliberately ignorant with earphones in and walk past people speaking to me lol. Though even with earphones in people can get pestered."

What was odd about the first dream is it was of a completely different person which was a real looking dream with no height or perception distortion then the dream went into a rectangle of blue light and they appeared to be swapped with this man, though while dreaming and after dreaming I just thought it was a distortion of the person I knew. I know a lot of people have ""doubles"" anyway and the body build is different from the person I knew, head shape etc similar features though. Obviously unrelated to the person I knew.

It's good they don't want to scare you because you wouldn't want to have a dream where they are pulling scary faces lol."
Dreams,eu5hpq1,t1_eu5d7zt,1563477814.0,"Seeing a similar looking person in real life was scary at the time though because it was late at night. I was about to walk towards a train station then a car appears from nowhere behind me does a sharp stop with the wheel turned in. It could of been completely innocent but for some reason I got the flight or flight response and just ran past the car and across the road. No one was around and they weren't stopping at the traffic lights or appeared to be collecting anyone, he was just staring at me straight faced then I had a deja vu episode. After a few minutes I went back and continued to go to the train station the car had gone, although similar looking I didn't think oh that guy looks like the one in a dream I had months ago, just thought it was funny how I saw someone similar. That was before the dream with the white light in.

When people talk of guides I don't hear things about them looking like humans for some reason. People tend to say they are angels and stuff like that.

Progress wise well I had a bad summer, autumn and winter of last year. Never had a dream like that before though, although he seemed familiar. I'd like to have more dreams of him. I don't know why my right eye opened, I struggle to open 1 eye by itself. It was like the dream was in the eye ball. It was just him looking down then turning around, didn't frighten me like a nightmare wasn't freaked out by it.


Your reply is interesting it's got me thinking."

precognition,eu4kaml,t1_eu4k62b,1563456370.0,Yes I agree not all deja vu itself has any link to precognition I mean as mentioned deja vu is in epileptics and something most experience. Deja reve Is the already dreamed. Why deja vu is already seen I don't know.
precognition,eu4jvoc,t1_eu4jigo,1563456046.0,Yes I know there is a difference between regular deja vu and the one one called deja reve from dreams also a focal epileptic so did get the regular deja vu aswell.
precognition,eu4jt1m,t1_eu4jigo,1563455989.0,Well all I can say with the example of my mother or anyone else told about my personal experience is the precognitive dream was not featuring her only whatever its about. I wouldn't call it a prediction in the sense of anything that could be changed and its not like you would always know a dream is precognitive until it happens. Some people don't believe precognitive dreams if they've not happen. Just because of a dream doesn't mean everything can be predicted and proven anyway. Like I haven't had a dream saying so and so youll be in a traffic jam tommorow if that was not a precognition which the dream is playing out because I'm actually with that person if that makes sense.
precognition,eu4j9nm,t1_eu4j3ze,1563455558.0,Most precognitive dreams are about the dreamers own experience they don't tend to be all these disasters on the news. Only way anyone could try and prove is to note them down before the event occurs. Its the dreamers own experience. Have you not had deja reve yourself?
precognition,eu4iggb,t1_eu4hk6c,1563454882.0,"I wish I could take a photo of the dream to show how real he was the visuals of my precognitive dreams have been the following.

One I had at 14 which happened 2 weeks later appeared to be slightly tilted to the side and for a strange reason blue and white.

One I had at 19 was pale the colors were pale and it appeared to be wavey like a screen was above my head. Happened 10 months later. 

One at 22 where the visual appeared saturated colours were exaggerated and fuzzes around objects but everything to the same size it would be in real life looking through eyes. That one happened 3 afternoons later.

Now the suspected precognitive with the man in was a cross between the one I had at 19 in visual and 22.the strange thing is that since the dream the thoughts I had in that dream are my thoughts now but the events of what my mind thinks of hadn't happened last year when I had that dream if that makes any sense.

My regular dreams tend to have a lot of distorted images."
precognition,eu4elxb,t1_eu4edtt,1563451345.0,"I genuinely need to know if a dream I had last year was a precognitive, it took on the precognitive visual I get and only lasted a few seconds but it had this man I don't even know in it. Saying ""hello Elizabeth"" and giggling and in my local accent which is strange for my dreams. He looked real not a distorted regular dream character. Considering he was standing next to someone I already know he could be a real person but il never know unless it plays out and its not like I have their name I just remember feeling nervous and hot in the dream. My precognitive dreams vary in visual but they always only last a few seconds."

Last year I was in a pub and my former Dr from where I used to live called me a ""fucking bitch"" he thought I was ignoring but this didn't happen in the office and I wasn't a patient anymore and it was in his personal time. So it can be shocking coming from professionals."

I also had a dream last year which I've mentioned on precognition that seemed precognitive in its nature but I'm skeptical.
In this dream I was in a brown room standing by myself then my current doctor walks up to me from the left and then a stranger from the right. The stranger has his arms folded wearing mens work clothes  you know black jacket white t shirt etc. He had black hair green eyes stocky 5ft something build and looked 30s. He grins and says ""hello Elizabeth"" and he and my Dr start laughing and I'm stood there wondering why they were laughing felt that emotion then woke up. It lasted a few a seconds and took on the visual of precognitive dreams I've had that happened but wheither it was I don't know yet. This man looked genuinely like a real person not a made  up dream character and to my knowledge I don't already know them. In the dream I had a sense I knew them.

See if you have any more dreams about the person, if you've experienced precognitive dreams before that could be a possibly. Perhaps it was a random guy."
Synchronicities,et99sof,t3_c76wbr,1562590952.0,I suppose it is possible they could of been on their mind after my friend gave them a thank you card from me before I moved they were professional relationship actually not a friend or anything. There was a time after I moved I was on the news not me personally but walking through train barriers and if they watched news I might have been thought of by a few others aswell lol. I'm not sure I occupy their mind unless I pop in.

precognition,esxrhvs,t3_c9eavs,1562334309.0,"Yes it's deja reve (already dreamed) or precognitive dreaming. I never knew the term deja reve until I looked on YouTube videos a few years ago.

I had a precognitive dream when I was 14/15 in 2006 that happened two weeks later which was my dad's side of the family knocking at the door and standing in the positions as the dream. The odd thing about this one is the dream was blue and white for some reason.

I had another in 2011 that happened 10 months later. In this dream my boyfriend was running down a street and when the dream happened he was running because he had to get back to college. I had some deja vu moments before the precognitive event.

I had another where I was sat in the front room and my dad walks in asking if I'd be alright and I replied yes. This dream was very saturated and bright in colors with fuzzes. This dream is the only one I knew would happen as I had an appointment 3 days later and it happened 3 days later in 2013.

I have had a few others as well.

I had a suspected precognitive dream last spring, it appeared precognitive in the visual and with no distortions you know like regular dreams people may represent someone but they are distorted the faces were clear and realistic. So in this dream I appear to be standing in a room by myself and then my GP walks up to me from the left, dressed as he would if you were to go for an appointment. Then an unknown young man walks up to me from the right, they stop in the middle and look at me. The younger man has his arms folded wearing black trousers, white t shirt black jacket normal works clothes. He has his arms folded and is grinning and then says ""hello Elizabeth"" and starts giggling and laughing. The man had black hair and green eyes, 5ft something and a slight stocky build. He looked like he was in his 30s maybe a few years older than me. In the dream I remember standing there thinking why they were laughing and feeling hot and in the dream I felt I recognised him but in real life as of yet I don't. Then in the dream my doctor and him were laughing, this dream was fuzzy on the edges but no distortion it lasted a few seconds then I woke up. It's been a year since I dreamed that and so far it's not happened and I hope it turns out precognitive because I am perplexed that this man looked like a real living person and not a random distorted dream character if that makes sense. He also spoke to me in my local accent and when I dream people don't seem to have any accent. Il just have to wait and see if it is precognition."
precognition,esh6gcw,t3_c7r0jo,1561984092.0,"I've done it before as well in a neurology appointment, she said no it's a seizure online on a website they were classing deja reve as a seizure one site said ""during a seizure may feel like a dream is happening"" I know deja vu is epilepsy related but personally I don't think deja reve is. I also mentioned it to a social worker a morning I came out of a and e and he was like ""no no it doesn't matter"" I think it freaked him out, nice chap though because for anxiety disorder I used to have anti psychotics that did something to me and I can't have them only lamotrogine for epilepsy."
PregnancyAfterLoss,esguuha,t1_er5ude0,1561968051.0,"I'm starting to think regarding early misscarrage there's no point me seeing a Dr if it happens again. There wouldn't be much they could do unless it didn't complete luckily it was a complete misscarrage over a few days, had the period return 9 weeks later. I try and avoid seeing 1 Dr because the first appointment after he was like how did you know it was a misscarrage though and I was trying to explain everything including I missed the period after intercourse etc he wasn't paying attention then said it wouldn't show up in the blood anyway because this appointment was a few weeks after. All he did was send me for a blood test because I lost weight after. The second appointment he acknowledged it and the third I saw my main Dr who listened but said next time see one of us if you need to once a test shows positive, next time if there Is a next time I will show them the tests. I try and ignore anyone saying ""oh it was just a late period or ovulation"" it was nothing like a period to me, I don't get cramps like that during a period, I don't spot and then have blood streak goo every month which looked exactly like the photos other people have put online. Definitely never experienced it before in my life. I wouldn't have been so upset if it was a period and you know instinctively what's going on in your body. I don't know how people who have misscarrage themselves can go round judging other people's when it wasn't there experience. In my right mind I wouldn't doubt anyone else it's rude."

It was dreamed last year and all that was said was ""hello Elizabeth"" he grinned and then him and my Dr were laughing and I was stood there not understanding why. In the dream I felt like I knew him but in real life don't. 

I had a vision in the day while half asleep of what was supposed to be my son in future and he said"" what's wrong mummy"" then saw white then opened my eyes again looked like a real person, he had also been in a dream."

It bothers me because out of all people why would an old Dr be swearing at me, probably thought I was being ignorant for not turning round. Luckily I've not bumped into him since I don't even know why I didn't turn around I'm usually vigilant, I have been advised if I do see him to smile say hello or just ignore it turns out he retired a few months after. Regarding the deja vu it could of been a forgotten deja reve dream. Or I could of been having a focal seizure.

I would recognise the voice if I heard it again sounded like a local accent I had an image of a person while hearing the male voice which is also why I thought I was going crazy.

Another strange thing last year is I had a dream that visually looked precognitive where I was standing in a room and my current Dr walks up to me from the left and this unknown younger man from the right who looked 30s.they stop in the middle and the stranger says ""hello Elizabeth"" grinning and giggling very distinctive local accent from the city I'm from. No idea who he is or if he's a real person but looked like a real person. Then I woke up that only lasted a few seconds and won't know if it's precognitive until it happens, I'm no stranger to precognitive dreams that have happened.

Around this time I started getting these visions which could of been my mind but was of the same stranger in a still frame image of him driving round a roundabout grinning me. It was a vision that lasted a few seconds, looked like real life vision and was as thought I was in a different place for a few seconds which I know sounds crazy. I describe it like an absence seizure but with a vision put in. Wheither that's precognitive or not I'm unsure."

One afternoon I was standing in the smoking area of my local pub. I was just drinking my drink staring into nowhere, I heard someone say something but didn't register I was being spoken to. So I continued to drink my drink. The next thing I hear is ""Its Dr (their name) you fucking bitch!"" then I half turned round and muttered fuck off back at him and then some men started laughing and as he swore at me I got the deja vu. It was odd because I hadn't had him as a gp since I was 18 and I moved to a new area 8 years before this and he doesn't live in the same area and he just turned up like that especially when he'd been thought of."
precognition,es0b0v2,t3_c55b2b,1561470888.0,Yes and as I saw the person I bumped into I had a deja vu moment. Nothing like that has happened since but I say to myself if it does then not to be surprised.
precognition,es05evv,t3_c55b2b,1561466237.0,"Not as such but last year I kept thinking about someone then a week or so just before bumping into them I had a male voice in my head telling me about the person but I just thought I was going crazy and ignored it. Then I ended up bumping into them out of the blue after years and the person was extremely rude to me.

Around the same time my own voice said I would be pregnant, again I thought I was crazy then not long after I suffered and early misscarrage."
AskReddit,erx2w9s,t3_c4aigm,1561369130.0,"I kept getting blocked by someone I went to school with and then they said ""please stop messaging me I have absolutely no interest in speaking to you or anyone else from school"" so I told him to fuck off if he wants to think he's better than everyone else. He had no sympathy for me explaining how I was after mentioning since we last talked I had a misscarrage or asking how he was. Don't care what happens to him now to be honest and glad I don't live near him anymore.

Other reasons were people didn't want to know me because of how short I was as a kid."
twinflames,erpuct8,t1_ermee9y,1561128213.0,I said something about that on another post I think. I don't think it causes a blockage with some things but without taking it things open up again or more frequently. Not good to not take it though you can end up hypomanic that's what happened to me.

He grins and says in a cheeky tone ""hello Elizabeth"" in the dream I also got a sense I knew who he was but in real life I've never met him as of yet.

My parents were never really upset by it despite it being their grandkid. I sometimes wish I was younger before it happened.

The one I suspect was precognitive I'd like to share. 

I appeared to be standing by myself in a brown room, all of a sudden my doctor walks up to me from the left and then a younger unknown man walks up to me from the right. The younger man has his arms folded and is grinning and giggling. He then says ""hello Elizabeth"" and starts laughing alongside my Dr. In the dream I had like a nervous embarrassed type of emotion not quite understanding what they were laughing at. In the dream I got the sense I knew who he was but in real life I'm certain I've not met him yet. My Dr has a giggling manner in real life and they both looked realistic with no distortion that was a dream slightly above my head like a screen, it lasted a few seconds and then I woke up.
