AskReddit,ezyw68z,t3_d34ln2,1568275833.0,"I was in year 10, a guy I had been dating suggested we skip class which was fine but I had a weird feeling as it as all still new & I was fairly innocent at that time I guess, so I said not too far, we went through the bush tracks next to the school to get to the shops down the road. Paused next to a river where he tried pushing me against a tree & pulling my pants down. I fought him off & ended up shoving him off & had a complete break down/rage fit.

Turns out a group of girls had also decided to skip that time. & Saw everything. But decided to skip the details where I was being sexually assaulted so it went around the whole school I was a massive easy slut who got fingered in the bushes (he hadnt even successfully taken my pants down I had trackies up to my waist for fuck sake). 
Had shit thrown at me from the buses, girls trying to start fights with me if I didn't back down to them calling me shit (which worked until I poured boiling water from my noodles cup on one of them... I should say I feel bad years later. But she was a cunt. I wish it left burns) & basically went from the girl who nobody knew a few months prior because I recently just changed schools to the complete social outcast over false information that even when I clarified what actually happened & it was public knowledge (to everyone but the new kid) he was a douche bag it didn't matter the damage was done. I lost a lot of friend over that, got to find out a lot of the ones I thought were friends were completely fake. 

Basically I have the biggest trust issues when it comes to making friends now. I'm used to guys being pushy & I guess my temper gets me out of bad situations sometimes. But to find out people who I thought I could confide in about the fact that it just became school news I was assaulted & people were practically saying it was my fault were still talking shit & continuing to spread what they knew were lies. 
Idk. Opening up to people isn't something I do anymore because I refuse to be made to look like an idiot like that again."

Nate - NF

This whole song does that tbh, I've had different friends over the years come from rough lives & it's like this song puts everything they've kinda described into one go. 
But those lines specifically remind me of an old high school friend, that due to our issues being so alike but also different we had to stop talking because we were severely toxic. We had a fight before we stopped talking & it feels like the things that I said I had to cut off communication for I've started doing without realizing years later. But if that's the case it's such a dark rabbit hole to go down & means we were just as bad as each other, & idk I guess when you pride yourself on trying to be a good person, learning your not sucks."
Anxiety,ezyqnfl,t3_d27e83,1568272902.0,"I think in long distance relationships it helps make those trust issues a bit more noticeable in comparison to one that's nearby. 

Personally I found the most important thing is to remember your past relationships aren't your current ones & you need to remind yourself of that even when you feel like the past is repeating itself, because there's a probably chance it's not. I know that can be hard, especially when you see some familiar patterns which trigger old wounds but a way to make it easier I found was for every/anything that made you anxious was to think of two things that remind you of why you're together & what made you fall for them to begin with.

 So if there's one negative thought: have two positive to counteract it.

I have two main memories that whenever I'm upset or had been worried in the past i always think back on, a major stepping mile to remind me that my partner isn't like my past ones & he doesn't want to hurt me, thinking of the first time he said ""I love you"" to me always makes me smile because I always remember that day so perfectly & it instantly makes my mood feel a bit better when we're far away. The other on is after a week where we'd had fights after a hour & a half drive id come to his house to see he'd make a blanket fort for us & it was such a perfect night even though it should've been me making it up to him. I'd never had someone put in that much effort for me before & it always makes my heart warm knowing he tries fun little things like that to make me smile. 

Sure he triggers my anxiety every here & there, but I know I trigger his a lot too. Unfortunately I don't think unless there's a way to completely wipe your memory of past events with the original people who caused these anxieties to stir in the first place, there's no real way to stop the anxious thoughts you just got to learn over time that you can trust them, that they do want the right thing by you.

You just need to remember over time that you guys grow together, there'll be ups & downs. But as long as at the end of the day she's who you want, it's most likely she feels the same. 

Maybe you guys need to discuss that more? Try to pick a date night or something where you remind each other of why you two love each other & what made you guys fall in the first place, if she doesn't react kindly to the suspicions maybe it's because she's worried about the same thing with you & you're creating a negative feedback loop because you're both so afraid of losing each other but don't know to discuss it properly. 

I don't know if that will help, I'm still fighting my demons & sometimes it doesn't work, but if two happy memories don't work just keep thinking of them they don't have be spectacularly extra, just something that made you smile or feel like for just that moment, that anxiety was just anxiety & you know at the end as long as you guys are together it'll be okay because those are the feelings you need to hold onto.
