I'll have to dig around to see if I can find any evidence of my acne pre-IUD. I also had no idea that Lush isn't all it's cracked up to be.

SkincareAddiction,fkliuhd,t3_fj8sxp,1584307249.0,"**SKIN CONCERNS:** chin acne, rosacea

**SKIN TYPE:**  normal

**BACKGROUND:** I have always had nice skin with the exception of acne on my chin. That only started at age 21 or so, and now I am 24 and still really struggling with it. I also have rosacea which I've tried to tackle a few times but the acne has always been my top priority. For years I only washed my face when I took a shower (every other day) using a basic gentle cleanser and moisturizer from either Cetaphil or Cerave. This kept my skin feeling good in all areas besides the chin breakouts. Finally, this winter, I realized that the acne wasn't going away unless I changed something. So, this past November, I started using a few of the following products, and slowly introduced the rest over time. Once I had the full line-up in my routine I kept it up for three months. I washed my face every night and tried to be better about touching my face as well. Now that it's been three months I feel defeated because my chin has not gotten better. I'm at a loss. I don't know what to do.

**ROUTINE:**

a.m.

* *Lush 'Eau Roma Water' toner* \- spritz on forehead and cheeks (I've enjoyed this product in general. Feels refreshing and mild.)
* *Lush 'Tea Tree Water' toner* \- spritz on chin (This spray doesn't have alcohol in it which I really appreciate! It doesn't dry me out at all.)
* *Clinique 'Redness Solutions' cream* \- heavy layer on cheeks (This calms my rosacea on contact, but I'm not super sure if it's made any real difference over time)

p.m.

* *First Aid Beauty 'Pure Skin Face Cleanser'* \- wash entire face (I definitely love this cleanser - it's very gentle and doesn't target anything super specific which is great for me)
* *Lush 'Herbalism' cleanser -* scrub/wash chin (This stuff is pretty cool in general btw. Very green colored. Not sure if it's really done anything for the acne, but everyone's acne is different so take that with a grain of salt.) 
* Pat dry with clean towel
* *Lush 'Eau Roma Water' toner* \- spritz on forehead and cheeks
* *Lush 'Tea Tree Water' toner* \- sprits on chin
* Wait for skin to be fully dry
* *The Ordinary 'Hyaluronic Acid 2% +B5'* \- a heavy drop all over face, then let dry (I have not noticed whether or not this does anything good for me, but it hasn't done anything bad!)
* *The Ordinary 'Granactive Retinoid 2% in Squalane'* \- a heavy drop all over face, then let dry (I can for sure feel the oil for a while after applying this. Not in a greasy way though! It just takes a while to soak in.)
* *Neutrogena 'Hydro Boost water gel'* \- light layer on chin and forehead, let dry, then another layer (it seems this product needs a few applications before I really feel moisturized, but I reeeaaally love it)
* *Clinique 'Redness Solutions' cream* \- heavy layer on cheeks

Like I said earlier, I introduced the products to my skin gradually so I wouldn't irritate it more than necessary. I never experienced a 'purge' period. But like I said, after three months I still didn't notice any improvement. I gave up last week. I just feel like I'm totally wasting my time otherwise.

If anyone has any advice I'm all ears. And if there's any info I missed let me know and I'll do my best to answer!

depressed,fka0w2t,t3_fh9ten,1583988764.0,"Hey, good job at taking the steps to get help. That‚Äôs actually a really big step and shows a much higher chance that you will successfully treat your anxiety and depression. 

It sucks that the medications haven‚Äôt been working like they should. Unfortunately it can take a few tries (or more, in my case!) to find the right one. Everyone‚Äôs chemical imbalances are different, so it takes trial and error until you feel relief. So if you‚Äôre able to just hang in there for a while I promise that eventually a drug or combination of drugs will work for you. It‚Äôs frustrating getting there, but you will get there. 

I understand the need to self harm in some form. In my own experience and from what others have shared, psychologists are typically okay with the things you mentioned - rubber bands, ice, etc. - if it‚Äôs not causing true injury. Those are great methods of getting through those depression waves while staying away from more severe self harm methods like cutting. Sometimes the sting of a rubber band slapping your wrist is the only thing in the moment that can relieve emotional pain. 

When it comes to your interests and education, your feelings towards all of it are very valid. I‚Äôm 24 now, but through high school I felt much the same way. The educational system sucks for sure. But you‚Äôre really close to finishing school and not being under that stress. It was crazy for me, graduating high school, because this huge weight was lifted and suddenly 3/4 of my anxieties didn‚Äôt exist. So if you can stick it out for a few more years you‚Äôll have that feeling too. It blows that they don‚Äôt teach you about taxes and shit like that, but you can/will learn those things from real life experience and by watching other people do them as well. Don‚Äôt worry, you won‚Äôt be completely helpless by any means. 

Don‚Äôt worry, people in the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù (basically everywhere besides school) know that grades don‚Äôt mean shit. Once you‚Äôre out of school, you‚Äôll see that what really matters in the long run is getting an education in the first place! I hated high school but I do in fact use the skills I learned there. Can‚Äôt argue it. My scores and GPA don‚Äôt matter anymore - it‚Äôs all about the fact that I have a basic understanding of the core subjects. Does that make sense? Basically, stick it out haha. 

You definitely do seem very smart for your age. I can understand why you would want more challenge in life. I know it sounds lame, but are there any clubs or sports you could join? 

Anyway, you clearly have a good head on your shoulders so I‚Äôm confident that if you are patient a lot of these worries and stressors will naturally get better. Best of luck my friend!"
