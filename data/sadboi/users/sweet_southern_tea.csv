I know for andsct *now* that I would have not wanted it if it were to have happened and would have regretted it to this day. And more than likely would have gotten an abortion. I, too, got caught up in the life plan I thought was expected and supposed to happen.  Thank you for sharing your story."

BPD,etlm7qt,t1_etll8ae,1562940130.0,"It wasn't something small. It is an ongoing larger issue within our relationship that is exhausting on both ends. I apologized for my anger getting the better of me, but I did not call her names or make her feel bad for her feelings. I told her that her feelings are valid and that I'm very sorry that I let my emotions control me in that moment. But I in no way feel I was being abusive towards her. I let my anger control my reaction and got upset and was extremely frustrated. I'm not saying I haven't been abusive in that way in the past, because I have. Which is something I have worked very hard on. But this was just an argument that got a little out of hand, in my opinion. Idk. Sometimes I would just rather be alone. She told me to leave, so when I go to leave she gets angry that I'm leaving. She speaks to me like a child. If I'm standing when we are in an argument, and she wants me to sit down, she will scold me like I'm 5 until I do what she says. And frankly, I've been controlled enough by my own mother and I'm really sick of her doing it to me, too. If I refuse, she gets really angry. In the past she has called me really nasty, horrible names...told me she wishes I would just die etc. So, it's fine for her to say horrible shit out of anger, but if I get upset (and not even say mean things), I'm a terrible person and should be punished. I love her with everything in me. But I honestly just need a damn break."

CBS_Mom,etfzobh,t1_esd1ipu,1562780903.0,"No, you didn't miss anything. I feel like it was a way to fully write Violet out of the show since the writers started focusing on the friendships between the women more exclusively.

BPD,etfx6vg,t3_cbiz9y,1562779437.0,"Hey there, OP. I've dealt with this exact issue before, as well as disturbing images I for some reason come up with on my own. My only way of handling it thus far (I too am not able to do therapy atm) is to constantly bombard myself with happy images. I scroll through r/aww a lot. Look at funny animal youtube videos, watch comforting TV shows (for me it's a lot of Parks and Rec), or read familiar and comforting books. It can take a while, but eventually I am able to get past it. I'm not sure if this is helpful to you or not...but it's the coping method that has seemed to work for me, though I'm sure there are much better out there. I'm sorry you are dealing with this and I hope you are able to get through it sooner rather than later."

If i leave the house she wants to know exactly where I'm going, what time I'll be back etc. If I refuse to tell her she gets angry. I'm a grown ass woman and I'm paying them to live there. I'm hating every fucking second of it and can't wait to move back out in a couple of months. Try not to ever have to go back once you're out. The behavior on their part won't stop, trust me.

This is a big lesson in actions have consequences. I'm hopeful that she learns and when she ever does get another car, she stops. Unfortunately, it usually takes something bigger to happen, like an accident or getting pulled over. But, you sticking to what you said is really awesome. I know a lot of parents that would have gotten her another one after she pitched a fit. My sister being one of those parents.

As I said above, I adore how they have handled the show thus far; with the main focus being on the women's friendships, with a little LI thrown in via Bonnie. Oh! And I love Will Sasso being Jill's new LI. I'm so glad they didn't try and put her with some swanky (damn I'm definitly from the South lol) hedgefund manager...kind of like the rich dude she married before. She needs someone that will keep her grounded and down to earth. I really like him.

You definitly do make some really awesome points as to why we probably shouldn't see Christy with anyone at the moment. And I absolutly do not want to ruin the show with some weird forced LI plot. I just thought since after all of her hard work, and how everyone around her is finding a partner, why not her, too? Just my two cents. But I totally agree with you on your very good points."

But I never act out in this way to try and manipulate or make anyone feel bad for not giving me constant attention. I do feel bad for your friend. But you can't enable this type of behavior from them. I think you handled it in the best way possible. You weren't mean or rude. You were honest and told them in the most gentle way you could. I used NAH cause I don't think your friend is being malicious. I just think they have a lot of issues they need to work on.
