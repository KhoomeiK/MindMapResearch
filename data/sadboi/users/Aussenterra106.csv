The endorsement was reversed and noted as a mistake, but Kjellberg’s video response treated the incident as a joke, an overreaction, another media attempt to slander him.

Those who have shouted loudest about Akhand Bharat, the present Jana Sangh and its predecessors of the curiously un-Hindu spirit of Hinduism, have helped Britain and the Muslim League partition the country.”

2)Vinayak Damodar Savarkar who had formulated the two-nation theory with the greatest clarity in his 1923 essay Hindutva, published 16 years before Mohammed Ali Jinnah proposed the same idea. The Muslim League adopted the Pakistan Resolution in Lahore on March 23, 1940.
Savarkar, while delivering the presidential address at the 19th session of the Hindu Mahasabha in Ahmedabad in 1937, said: “As it is, there are two antagonistic nations living side by side in India. Several infantile politicians commit the serious mistake in supposing that India is already welded into a harmonious nation, or that it could be welded thus for the mere wish to do so. These, our well-meaning but unthinking friends, take their dreams for realities. That is why they are impatient of communal tangles and attribute them to communal organisations.”

Savarkar added: “But the solid fact is that the so-called communal questions are but a legacy handed down to us by centuries of cultural, religious and national antagonism between the Hindus and Moslems. When time is ripe, you can solve them; but you cannot suppress them by merely refusing recognition of them

3)Nehru wrote in The Discovery of India on his propagation of the two-nation theory: “Why only two I do not know, for if nationality was based on religion, then there were many nations in India. Of two brothers one may be a Hindu, another a Muslim; they would belong to two different nations.”
4)B.R. Ambedkar, one of the key architects of the Constitution, wrote: “Strange it may appear, Mr Savarkar and Mr Jinnah, instead of being opposed to each other on the one nation versus two nations issue, are in complete agreement about it. Both agree, not only agree but insist, that there are two nations in India — one the Muslim nation and the other Hindu nation.”

The reason is that the Muslim League's demand for Pakistan was a cause embraced by the Muslim elite, the very same people who were allowed to vote and were likely to gain economic and other opportunities from the creation of Pakistan. This is a fact that India's British rulers clearly understood. ""[A] vote of the whole adult population or of the enfranchised population would be unlikely to provide the result that Jinnah requires,"" wrote Viceroy Lord Wavell to Lord Pethick Lawrence, Secretary of State for India, on 20 November, 1945.
Limited franchise in effect meant that only people with property or money, and educated professionals, had the right to vote. The large mass of people, of all communities, was simply disenfranchised.""

1)He is on one hand saying that this bill is to protect minorities in countries which have Islam as their state religion while on the other hand saying that Ahmedi muslims can't be protected coz its their own matter.While he acknowledges that muslims in states like Myanmar are infact oppressed,he's saying that only because this bill doesn't protect them that doesn't mean that this bill can't be passed.I think of it as only a technicality coz this bill discriminates and goes against the basic viewpoint of our constitution.
2)He makes the argument that coz these countries have Islam as official religion, we need to protect them.I think he knows that China is officially atheist and many minorities like Falun gong and Uyghurs are prosecuted specifically because of their religion.
This interview is very brief,so I think I am unable to grasp his whole view.I respect him for protecting Kulbhushan Jadhav in ICJ but I can't agree with him on this like I didn't agree with him on the Salman Khan case in which he defended him.

PS: I am not in favour of granting free citizenship to any foreign person irrespective of their religion. If you contribute to our society greatly,you are welcome.If no,sorry we can only grant you refuge but not citizenship.Almost all western countries do this.Try to settle there,you will know.
China and Japan has strict immigration policy where its incredibly hard to be granted a citizenship coz they know that their culture is so different than the people who come.Only having a common religion isn't enough.The incoming people will burden our already over-burdened social services and they are going to change demographics almost instantly which we are not ready for right now.
