mentalhealth,fou5q2k,t3_g9i16l,1588076901.0,"Anxiety is an emotion, not just an illness. Regular people experience anxiety all the time. ""I am experiencing anxiety."" If you find that you experience more anxiety than you think you should, or during events that shouldn't elicit anxiety you can go to your doctor and tell them you might have anxiety.


Similarly, regular people can experience depressive episodes, and depression can manifest itself in different ways in different people and different people cope in different ways. People spamming ""lol so depressed rn"" might seem offensive or distasteful to you but this could be a way of coping, for instance humour and hyperbole are often used as coping strategies. Additionally, just because someone doesn't act the way you think they should, doesn't mean that their, or your, feelings are any less valid.


You state that your therapist has told you you might have anxiety or depression, or display those symptoms. What you do with that information is important, no amount of therapy will work unless you do some introspection. Do those descriptors resonate with you? If they don't, ask your therapist why they think that. Waiting around for a diagnosis, without actually asking for one isn't going to get you a diagnosis. Mental health is notoriously hard to both diagnose and treat as every disorder has conflicting definitions, overlapping symptoms and are often co-morbid with other disorders. Writing out yourself a list of symptoms, consulting with your therapist and presenting this to a doctor may help in a formal diagnosis, but some people never get to go through that process and have to resort to self-diagnosis. Yes it's very easy to misdiagnose yourself, but if you're feeling depressed.... You're depressed.

It is problematic that you don't want him to get a girlfriend. You want to keep him for yourself whilst not actually having a romantic relationship. That's unfair to him, especially if you don't conform to the same rules. If he wants to break it off and pursue a romantic relationship with someone else that's his prerogative and you can't stop him from doing that, especially when you're not in a relationship.
