Things you need to consider if you are planning on driving is the cost of it.  Depending on where you live, you’ll need auto insurance and you’ll have to pay for the vehicle registration. Depending on what vehicle you get determines much of the cost.  Also insurance premiums differ greatly depending on your age.

Rest assured, most officers want what’s best for your wellbeing.   They genuinely care about the people they interact with on a daily basis.   They want to help you.  

After this most recent interaction I’m glad you now have a more positive attitude towards the police.   They’re human beings just like you and me.   Be respectful towards any officer and they’ll most likely respond respectfully in return.
