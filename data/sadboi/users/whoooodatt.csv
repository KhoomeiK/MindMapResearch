The measurement from the hollow of your neck to your waist and from your waist to your hip line are also considered separate measurements for this reason. I have a low hip line and a short torso—so my waist is an inch below my ribs, but my “rise,” or my waist to hip line, is an inch and a half longer than average. waist to hip ratio can fluctuate but the measurements based on your skeletal structure don’t change, and there is significant variation amongst both men and women.

NarcissisticAbuse,fjjfr9e,t3_fdni6l,1583394066.0,"Let me tell you a a story—

My mom left my toxic dad when she was sixty five. She now lives in a cabin in the Pacific Northwest with her boyfriend—her high school sweetheart. He makes her a tasty but low cholesterol breakfast every day to toe to work because he doesn’t want to lose her. They chop wood together for the stove and have a thousand dogs. He’s proud of how she helps all the kids she teaches at community college, sometimes out of bad relationships or drug problems. They get five dollars for free every day at the casino close by because they’re past retirement age or the way home from work.  they use it to find travel and my mom saw her first bald eagle on a cruise to Alaska. He messes around with musical instruments in the den while she plays dumb games on her phone and calls her kids. She got him a job as an av guy for the college and now he knows Spanish because he mostly did college classes. 

It’s not a glamorous life but they are stupid happy together. My mom used to think she would only be happy if she or my dad were dead—but they’re both happy now. 

My dad met his now wife online. She is a task mistress which is exactly what he needs. Four years later he is vegan, lost almost a hundred pounds, had knee replacement and quadruple bypass surgery and is a new person.  He never would have done it with my mom. I’m not a fan of men who need mommies all their lives, but they work together and she’s put ten years back on him and I have to thank her for that. 

Both my parents found love again. And they had ten years on you. Love really is all around you. No matter how old you are I promise. 

don’t let age be the thing that holds you back. It’s not a good excuse:)"
abusiverelationships,fjhl7rl,t3_fdbazz,1583350278.0,"I was about to leave mine and then he got diagnosed with cancer. I thought maybe we could grow together if I stayed and nursed him through it. The abuse he heaped on me during that time was unreal. I finally left and it’s like I never helped him through any of his surgeries, chemotherapy, doesn’t matter. The reason you feel the way you do is because abusers make sure that your one and only responsibility is taking care of them. I’ve been out since the end of December and it’s like I can breathe again. I worry about him sometimes, like is he still immunocompromised with the corona virus going around—but he doesn’t want my concern unless I’m letting him run all over me. I won’t contact him because he accused me of domestic violence, animal neglect, intentionally isolating him from his family, trying to take out an expensive insurance policy on him and death threats. It doesn’t matter that I held him up while he peed in a jar, cleaned him up when he shit and vomited all over himself repeatedly, rubbed his feet every day to try to alleviate neuropathy symptoms, attended every single chemo appointment and drs appointment, stayed at the hospital from 7am to 11 pm every day. He’s not grateful, he didn’t care. It was what was due him. 

He didn’t care that accommodating his parents in our house for a year left me with nowhere to sleep except the couch for months and months, that I couldn’t juggle my job and caring for him with anything left for myself. I put on thirty pounds, threw out my back, working and personal relationships fell apart, I went into debt. He felt entitled. Cancer became a tool for abuse. Your husband/boyfriend will feel entitled to use his accident and the sadness and compassion you have for him as a way to keep you in line—he will make you feel guilty if you aren’t doing things for him that he “can’t.”  It is not your job to be a rock for someone who will not only let you sink, but use your kindness as an excuse to push you under. You deserve better. I swear."

Obviously I quit drinking around him after that, but he totally kept pushing it on me too, telling me I should “allow myself to relax, I work so hard.” I can only assume he was trying to get a power of attorney to go after his agenda of getting on the title to my house after his first attempts didn’t work."

A tailor is the master artisan behind a specific subset of clothing—suits, for men or women. It requires a great amount of skill and education. This is the person who you go to for a bespoke suit. I know both males and females who are master tailors. 

A “seamstress” on the other hand generally hems pants at a dry cleaners making maybe a dollar over minimum wage. I know zero people at all who identify as a seamstress. In the industry we call ourselves stitchers, a word that is not recognized by the dictionary yet as far as I know despite it being around at least as long as I have in the industry (15 years).
