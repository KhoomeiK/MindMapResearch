SkincareAddiction,flhdmr3,t3_foo7p8,1585160694.0,"Use stuff with no fragrance.  Lush uses fragrance in every single one of their products.  Just because it‚Äôs ‚Äúnatural‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a miracle cure.  I use a tub of Eucerin, which has my medication in it that my allergist prescribed me.  If you don‚Äôt have medication, use a thick moisturizer and seal it with Aquaphor or Vaseline.  Quite honestly, though, if you‚Äôre not having any luck with Cerave, Cetaphil, Eucerin, or Vanicream, etc. alone, then I highly recommend seeking medical advice as it has helped me immensely.  Good luck, eczema is really frustrated and I totally understand the way you‚Äôre feeling!"

hsp,fhbw27x,t3_f2bq37,1581451087.0,"I really had trouble with that in the past and that‚Äôs what led to me feeling really depressed.  For HSPs, I find distraction is key.  My psychiatrist agrees with this as well.  For us, it‚Äôs easy to get caught up in feelings and when we attempt to process them we overthink.  Games really help me, anything that can get my mind off what I‚Äôm feeling.  As for preventing this in the future, being mindful of your thoughts really helps.  I know not all are up to it, but just meditating 10 min (not even everyday, like 3-5x a week) has helped exercise my mindfulness skills.  Headspace is awesome, it‚Äôs very peaceful and has no distracting music.  By doing this I have become aware of when I‚Äôm starting the train of negative thinking.  Then I just have to be firm with myself and say, ‚ÄúNope!  We are not doing this!‚Äù  It takes discipline because many of us are so wired to feel and feel and feel.  Along my mindfulness journey I‚Äôve noticed and learned that the mind likes to focus on the problems, and when I give into that I feel miserable.  Lol sorry this is a long reply, but overall being aware of your thoughts and not giving into them has helped me (and also my medication, but not everyone needs that).  Thoughts create feelings.  I hope this can help!
Edit: I just wanted to mention I also get left out a lot and it really helps me to tell myself that if those people are rude enough to leave me out, then they wouldn‚Äôt be fun to hang out with.  They are not true friends!"
