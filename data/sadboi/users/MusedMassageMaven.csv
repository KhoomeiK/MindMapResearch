airplaneears,ercjfwj,t1_ercj5pd,1560713796.0,"When you put it in that perspective, that totally makes sense. I have only had two cats that liked water. And the one I have now, Nala, the obsession to the tub, dripping water from the faucet & any time I head towards the bathroom-is very real!"
depression,ercj66z,t3_c1dnv9,1560713589.0,"Thank you for sharing. While I haven’t gone through what you have, I can imagine that was rough. I know today is hard, but look at all the kids that have an amazing Uncle & great-Uncle because of you.

depression,eqqgmde,t3_bymg3e,1560220539.0,"For those of you who commented & those of you who just read:

How are you doing today?

Better? That’s GREAT! Tell me what happened.

Worse? That’s okay, too. You had a good day to start the week. Tell me what happened.

You see, I’ve been pretty bad, too. I’m not telling you that for sympathy, just to help you understand where I stand. There are still “bad” days. And there are days that are worse than those. But then, there are the good days & the great days! 
And your great day may just be to get out of bed-AND THAT IS AMAZING!

We’re here. On this sub-Reddit about depression & hopefully, we can become this world-wide, f’ing awesome tribe, of people who are Depression Survivors, or Depression Defeaters or Champions of Depression...whatever you want to call it.

Anyway, Love to you all! See you tomorrow."
