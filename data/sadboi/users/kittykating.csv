motorcycle,fphqf6v,t1_fphhqn4,1588625906.0,Thank you so much for taking the time to reply! Ive been watching the channel on YouTube called ‚Äúblockhead‚Äù and i feel like its helping me a lot since he takes the time to explain things into detail. The maintenance thing is something i was thinking about cuz i wanna be able to understand the bike and realize sooner if something is off. As for the model i dont think a sportsbike is something i want i am a short girl so i feel like a HD iron 883 or a royal enfield would make me feel more safe. I sat on a HD IRON and the weight and how safe i felt having my feet well placed is something i did not feel at all when i was on top of a sports one. Thanks again üòâ

CatAdvice,fny549w,t3_g4hocf,1587353635.0,I think you should talk to a vet before getting into any conclusions or getting desperate. Sometimes its best to filter out the informations we see online... i have a type of diffuser that works by evaporating the essential oils and my house is very well ventilated... my cat is healthy she does yearly check ups and there was never a sign of toxic build up. So like i said... talk to a vet before worrying too much.

I have a ""history"" with the fox and i am very connected to the symbolism... the card is allowing me to keep the bond strong. That\`s why she is the star of my ""altar"" hehe"
tarot,fnw3sw3,t1_fnvzknm,1587310863.0,Hi there! Since is a deck more about the animal energy and spirit i wouldnt pair it with some other card from the original arcana.
