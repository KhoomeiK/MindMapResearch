Maybe a teeny bit severe to say hate. Cuz they are siblings But it’s important that you do state your boundaries. Cuz even if they have a disability some things aren’t acceptable. People always say that people wil disabilities are people. I 100% agree but that also means that some things will be the same. Racial slurs are terrible and hurtful. NTA but this is such a crappy situation.
