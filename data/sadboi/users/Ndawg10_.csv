depression,fefdqe3,t1_fe6ehyw,1579054130.0,"Just finished reading the whole document, and BOY that shook me, mainly because I felt like you were talking about me instead of you. Your dream about dad pressuring you into getting into a good university? My reality. The main reason for my depression is the constant bombardment of tiny insults from everybody I held close to me: ‘I’m smart academically but extremely lacking in common sense’, ‘you’re rubbish’, ‘what’s wrong with you?’, back when I was about 12. I’m now 17 and, although the insults hurt me a bit less and are far less frequent, I still feel the pain I felt as a 12 year old crying in my room. Society has made me lose my sense of identity, it’s made me unhappy with who I ( think I ) am, and the worst thing is, I’m not at all where I wanna be in life, and so there’s no motivation to DO anything. Any therapist here costs about £50/session, and my close ones are always busy or don’t take my complaints seriously, so I CANT talk about it. It’s why I came on here, to talk to guys that share the same issue as me."
