AskDoctorSmeeee,fqyctdv,t3_gl3lym,1589746510.0,"Hi all!

Thanks so much for your insight and support. I can't figure out how to edit my post on mobile so this is what we've got to go with lol.

I went to a walk in clinic today. The doctor was incredibly kind and helpful. (Poor guy probably repeated himself about 13 times answering my questions haha)

He palpated around and explained things to me as he examined. (He could even tell that I hadn't pooped yet which I thought was hilariously fascinating. Sorry if TMI lol)


So basically what I've taken from my visit is:

1. Not a hernia. Abdominal wall is still firm and intact. Also, most likely not intestinal, given the location.

2. Pregnancy is a big possibility, regardless of my IUD. (Shocker! Why didn't anyone guess this? /s) Most likely an ectopic pregnancy in my case, if anything.

3. If not pregnancy, he suggested the possibility of ovarian cysts. When palpating my lower right quadrant, he found that my point tenderness and bloating was indeed centralized around the vicinity of my right ovary. As of now, with a lack of severe pain and cramping, he opted against an ultrasound considering I am uninsured. (So considerate of him omg)

4. He mentioned that, yes, bodies change. It is also not uncommon for ovaries to swell throughout a cycle, but because I am underweight, it may just be more noticeable on me. This could well be just a new normal for my body as I'm aging. (Not saying I'm in the clear for sure, but it is a possibility)

5. Not a UTI or STI as no accompanying symptoms for those conditions are present.


I chose to go for a pregnancy test and it came back negative. However, I'm only three days past my expected start date, and with spotting that started this afternoon. (Fingers crossed!!!) Again, still not in the clear, but it is promising.

So. A lot of non-answers today but for now he suggested ""watchful waiting"".

(I am way too impatient for this lol.)

He said that if I am still experiencing the same symptoms in two weeks that I should take another pregnancy test and go from there. If symptoms worsen or change then go back for a visit and he can help me find an OB/GYN.

So that's where things stand with ""The Case of the Mysterious Tummy Lump.""

I'm sure I'm forgetting so much here, sorry. But thanks again, so much, to everyone!"

In all seriousness though, your blatant disregard for my health and that of any potential fetus I may be harboring is truly unsettling.

Have you considered a situation in which a pregnancy would not only fail, but could be fatal for me? Like, say, an ectopic pregnancy for example..?

Or maybe you didn't consider that I could be an abusive person. Or maybe I'm an addict. Maybe a child would bring crippling financial strain, rendering me homeless and unable to properly care for said child, resulting in yet another poor soul being tossed into an already over populated foster care system.

Or maybe I simply would rather not have someone's personal beliefs pushed onto me?

I have an IUD so I didn't think that pregnancy would be likely? (And no, btw. You weren't creepy. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this!!!)

I've always been known to have occasional constipation around my period, which is due any day now. Otherwise idk.

When I say ""second time this week"" I mean I woke up, oh maybe three days ago?, with the same thing, same size, same feeling. It got smaller once I got to walking around and less hard/less noticeable as the day continued.

As I type now, I can kind of feel some pressure where the lump was."

Part of me wonders if some residual homophobia ""brain washing"" (for a lack of a better term) is still floating around in my subconscious, telling me that it's wrong. I'd definitely be terrified to bring a girl home, partly because many of my family members are church goers while others are just closed minded.

Side note... idk about you but I've also wondered if it's just a lack of experience for me. Like when I was a little kid and had a crush and didn't know what to say or how to act around them. Obviously due to the religious thing, I only pursued my male interests and so never got any practice flirting with girls. I'm also just terrible at flirting in general as I can't read people well but that's unrelated.

Sorry to ramble. Basically I can't say for sure one way or another what to do. Just trying to let you know that you're not alone on this.

bigdickproblems,fpsdr1l,t1_fps0wek,1588871751.0,"28F here and can attest to this. And not only this but any kind of physical or mental trauma! 

My ex and I kept trying to have sex through some really rough patches and trauma and since I wasn't all in, it was really painful. I was dry as a bone, couldn't ""grow"" (yes, some girls do that) and I couldn't get off, like, at all. So trying to have sex in this state was all the more traumatic to my organs, as well as my mental state because I kept feeling like something was wrong with me, crazy cycle, blah blah.

After that, things were just never the same. My entire body seemed to boycott sex with him and after years of trying to push through, I just couldn't handle it anymore. Wound up being a DB for the final two years of the relationship.

(That isn't why we split, but it definitely played a huge role in our falling apart.)

I should also note that he was about 6"" x 4"" or so. Idk the exact measurement but he was slightly larger than average. And, at the risk of being explicit here, I've taken guys who were almost twice his size, so it really seemed to be all situational and mental after a certain point.

Best advice (albeit unsolicited) I can offer is if your SO is having trouble taking you, then take a step back. Be as understanding as possible and take your time trying to make them comfortable and ready before engaging physically. This is equally frustrating on their side as it is yours, if not more. It isn't your fault or theirs.

I tried out the newly modified expression with my brother and he immediately just goes ""uh, are you ok?"" 
Now concerned, I asked why, and he just said ""you're making a weird face like you're confused or anxious or something""

I should probably mention that the face I was practicing was my happy listening face. My regular happy listening face is all eye brows and cheeks. I thought I was doing a good job toning it down but apparently trying to control my natural expression just makes it weird.

So anyway, I just went back to my natural expressions. I figure that if it's weird, then it's just going to be weird, but at least it's me. People have been trying to coach me on how to act properly but it's exhausting. I don't make much of a fuss anymore over whether someone has or hasn't recognized my strangeness or its roots.


TL;DR
Do what works for you, but to me it seems like a natural expression will seem more genuine to people and they'll probably be fine with it.

However, if you are set on doing something, practicing in the mirror works pretty well, so long as the face you practice isn't a goofy one."

Also, sometimes it seems like people act as though they are angrily upvoting just to prompt the sub link, which I personally find to be what's unoriginal and annoying about it."
Sleepparalysis,fpk2bkx,t1_fpj57yc,1588686556.0,"That's absolutely terrifying; I'm so sorry that you have to suffer through that. 

I remember as a kid, maybe around 8 years old, when I awoke, I was trying to get an ice cream from the ice cream truck and stood up on my bed with my arms stretched out. But from what I remember it was more dream like? I felt groggy like I typically do in my dreams. But I was convinced I was getting ice cream! 

Anyway, I guess what I mean to say is that I'm sorry that these hallucinations are so scary for you, but is it possible to have less intense ones? Is there any help for this kind of thing for you?

I hate to be a bother, so if my own Q&A type post in this (or another) sub would be more appropriate, that's fine too =)"
Sleepparalysis,fpj2054,t1_fpiyq4q,1588654386.0,"Thank you! It's so nice to find supportive and accepting communities like this.

I've never heard of hypnolomic hallucinations. Are they like a continuation of a dream as you wake? 

Tbh I've always just assumed that what I experience is like some kind of vivid half-dream, if that makes any sense. Getting the spins (not dizzying or nauseating, just a skipping merry-go-round kind of feeling) is the biggest clue that things might get weird for me though. Whatever that means.

I'm looking into sleep specialists now, but I don't think I can afford it right now."
Sleepparalysis,fpiy4wk,t3_gd62v0,1588651522.0,"Is it anything like ""the spins"" but fuzzy and less spinny and your body feels heavy?
I'm not sure if what I experience is SP but I do get the heavy fuzzy spin feeling often before my (possible) SP-like symptoms.

Again, I really don't know what it is I'm experiencing, so sorry if I'm out of place here!"
