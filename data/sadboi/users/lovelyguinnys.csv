Everything you feel and think is completely normal, really! You are already a couple of months in te process and I think it helped you guys that you were prepared when your little boy was born. You got to absorb everything positive from his life with you, wich is really a good thing. Grieving is unpredictable, you probably will get ups and downs, completely normal.

I went into the drugstore and there were letters telling what we could and couldn't do. We could pay in cash but had to put the money on the cash register instead of in the cashiers hand. By the time I got to the cash register, apparently a call had just come in that cash could not be accepted any more. The lady before me just had cash and no bank card, so I offered to pay for her stuff with my bank card. She gave me the money, but she was very happy she didn't have to go home and come back with her bank card."
