I watch myself and try finding the attractive features of my body..I avoid noticing anything that I find ugly about myself. Then when I feel a little better.. I put on clothes and try doing something that makes me feel good.(ex. Singing, Dancing, Going for a walk etc.) Doing that my confidence level boosts back up and the anxiety goes away."

She thought I will come to my senses and apologise to her and decided not to give me any answers. 48 hours passed and we broke up.

AskReddit,fh4o1v9,t3_f15nbj,1581280495.0,I just started seeing this girl when I was a teenager she invited me to a common friend's house. She pushed me in a room while her friends locked the door from the outside. Then she started aggressively kissing me. When I told her to stop and pushed her away she told me I can't leave without kissing her back or she'll scream and create a scene. I pushed her away and tried to open the door. She then jumped over me and we both fell in the bed. She then started groping me and kissing me while being on top of me. I again pushed her away and headed for the bathroom. She managed to enter the bathroom before I could lock myself in there. Then she told me alright I'll let you leave if you kiss me back once. Just when i was about to kiss her back one of my friend opened the room lock and I fleed the scene. I am now 24 and still have intimacy issues because of that experience.
