I have those diagnoses, bipolar and borderline personality disorder and it’s upsetting when people try to tell me I only have one or some such. I hate that. And it happens a lot. It’s not that I’m proud of my diagnoses it’s just that I have the right to know what I have. And I know I have both. That’s just my two cents I guess. It reminded me of those types of incidents. I’m glad you were able to open up. And I hope people continue to respond respectfully."
