AnorexiaNervosa,fpn1enf,t3_gece8e,1588747333.0,Change is scary and can be overwhelming (especially something like this!) but don‚Äôt let this stop you from getting to a better place. You deserve to be happy and healthy and this is the next step towards that
AnorexiaNervosa,fp9u0j2,t3_gbzg95,1588434532.0,I‚Äôm so proud of you!!! You deserve to be healthy üíû
EDAnonymous,fp2fief,t3_gavdzo,1588260874.0,Yeah. I get the urge whenever I‚Äôm stressed or upset about something. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be food related. It releases endorphins so I guess that‚Äôs why
EDAnonymous,fp2fa94,t3_gaxt2k,1588260761.0,I have nightly dreams of going to the grocery store to buy as many safe foods as my heart desires...so yeah
AnorexiaNervosa,foofdps,t1_foof5mn,1587937962.0,Yes!!! It‚Äôs crazy how much our EDs affect more than just food alone
AnorexiaNervosa,fooesih,t3_g8gpo7,1587937673.0,"Yes :( I‚Äôm either REALLY good about drinking water and staying on top of water intake (usually when I‚Äôm eating more too) but I also have phases of intense restriction and somehow water also gets caught up in that. For me, it‚Äôs psychological and I don‚Äôt want anything in my mouth or to feel like I‚Äôm consuming anything"
safe_food,fonx7c2,t1_fonwu47,1587928244.0,Hmm the thickening part could be nice in oatmeal...right now I use a chocolate plant protein for oats and it‚Äôs decent but nothing to rave about. Do you just get plain protein or do you get the flavored ones?
Myfitnesspal,fonx0ri,t3_g8eovr,1587928141.0,Awesome thank you for posting this! Turning off the auto renewal was super easy too
safe_food,fonw8j4,t1_fon410m,1587927696.0,How does pea protein compare to other protein powders in terms of taste/texture?
safe_food,fofun8u,t1_fofr6k3,1587743119.0,"It has a pretty high sodium content but it‚Äôs not as sharp as say, chicken broth. I always drink a bunch of water with it though to help flush out the extra salt and avoid bloating :)"
safe_food,fod4sp8,t1_focc6ds,1587679874.0,Yes!! I‚Äôll even get fancy and put some mustard or a small dab of hummus with it lol

EDAnonymous,fnwc62l,t1_fnvmjfv,1587315564.0,‚ÄúSuccess is uncertain...failure is safe & stable‚Äù really just made a lot of things click for me. Thank you <3
EDAnonymous,fnqpslo,t3_g3bob1,1587169572.0,"Absolutely! I feel like I‚Äôm more ~in the driver‚Äôs seat~ when I‚Äôm restricting and that self-discipline carries over into other aspects of my life. Sometimes I get too dizzy/weak to complete homework but for the most part, restricting makes me feel like I have more motivation/energy to complete my work."

aldi,ezmthxk,t3_d1bzd6,1567996776.0,I tried it & I thought it tasted awful. Maybe it was just a bad bottle but it was horrible. The other flavor wasn‚Äôt very impressive either though so maybe Aldi coffee is just a strike out for me

Carl is doing well! He‚Äôs been so busy with school that he hasn‚Äôt had much time to visit but we love him dearly! Next time he‚Äôs home we‚Äôll have to all come over for a visit like the old days.
