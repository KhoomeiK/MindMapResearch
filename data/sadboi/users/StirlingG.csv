Hmm... I'm not retarded, but it seems you're bad at math to say that it's impossible.

My old v8 2003 toyota 4runner got 16.5 MPG average. 

I drove more than 47,000 miles in my first year of ownership on my Tesla, thanks to a very long commute into the desert everyday and a couple of roadtrips. In that first year of ownership, the average gas price in Las Vegas was 3.15 according to gasbuddy.

That distance would have cost me $8972 in the forerunner, not including the oil changes and brake maintenance that I don't need with a Tesla.        (47,000 / 16.5) * 3.15 = 8972

My Tesla... has an EPA rating of 240 Wh/mi, but in my first year of ownership, it actually got 270 Wh/mi (because i like to go fast). This meant if I paid for every kilowatt, it would have cost me $761.40 at the $.06/KwH energy rate for electric vehicle owners in Las Vegas.        ( (47,000 * 270) / 1000 ) * .06 = 761.40

So I would have saved $8210 IF I paid full price for my electricity. BUT it gets better, because Tesla gave me 9 months of free charging because I bought through the referral program, so I only actually spent about $200 total the whole year on charging my car. (if that, my long roadtrips were free).

If you want to count the oil changes and maintenance I skipped, it's more like 9000 dollars in savings, also it saved me 7500 dollars on my taxes through the federal credit, so that's nice also. 

So...
