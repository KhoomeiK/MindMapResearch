And that I was totally fine and I just wanted to be different and have a mental disorder. And I actually bought into it. My own dad said I was “acting crazy” and that I didn’t actually have a disorder. (Despite being diagnosed in three separate hospitals on three separate occasions 🤔). These same people who tell me “nothing’s wrong with you” will turn around and be like “what’s wrong with you?! That’s not normal. You have problems.” Anyway, I don’t listen to that kind of stuff anymore. I believe in myself. What I go through is as valid and legit as it gets. Don’t let others tell you otherwise."

He said that his friends like me so I have to stay away from them. Yet, I’d always let him around my [female] friends. I had no problem with it. He was emotionally abusive sometimes. Never insulting my looks but ALWAYS insulting my personality. Saying things like “you’re cold hearted”, “your parents fucked you up.” And “You wanna hoe around?” God I’m glad he’s in jail.

confession,f8nqsj4,t1_f8nqeeh,1574650563.0,"I guess for me, the reason I am so absolutely abhorred and disgusted by the breeding fetish is because of my dislike for the human species as a whole. The idea of breeding brings you to the idea of babies. And that’s another thing I can’t stand. Ever since I was a kid I hated babies. I used to hurt them when no one was looking and the adults were away. I guess what I’m trying to say is that I really hate people and the idea of humans continuing to live on through generations."

All this negative feedback is only pissing me off and I’m hanging on to my beliefs. Not changing what I said or how I feel. And I hate to say it but this “stigma” exists for a reason. BPD stigma, NPD stigma, blah blah blah. We’re not bonded by mental illness and I’m not obligated to kiss the ass of every other person with a cluster b personality disorder. Be it a narcissist, sociopath or a borderline. We might share a diagnosis (and this goes for all of you), but that does not mean we’re the same or anything alike in personality if you take the disorder out of it. I had 2 exes who were borderline (one undiagnosed), I feel nothing about the fact that I used them. Took advantage of them whenever I needed them but I was out of site when they needed me. They were too needy, too crazy, too everything. And once I get done with the infatuation phase, then I’m done. My abusive POS dad has NPD. From as far back as I can remember, I’ve always wanted to kill him. I feel nothing for him, he could die tomorrow and I wouldn’t bat an eye. To reiterate, stigma exists for a reason, narcissists can go to hell, and I’m not obligated to like or put up with every other borderline who comes my way."

I turn 20 in December and I don’t know if I could honestly make it past 19. I’m this close to ending it all. I’m broke, unemployment, disqualified from the military (my dream job), and my friend who’s apartment I’ve been staying in is moving because of his financial problems so I have before Thanksgiving to move out.

I turn 20 next month and I’ve never had a real job in my life. Currently unemployed, broke, stressed, homeless and couch surfing in NYC. My friend is going through something financially so he’s moving and I have till before Thanksgiving to find a youth shelter. For me I have major depression and alcoholism on top of my BPD so it’s really just the triple threat. My insurance doesn’t cover or take most therapies; especially not DBT I think. So I couldn’t get better even if I wanted to. But I’m partially scared to. I wasn’t the strong assertive no-fcks-given, party-going person I am now. Before my symptoms really started to show up I was basically this loser. Idk who I am anymore. Definitely scared to get better. But I’m also scared this disorder will be the end of me one day if I don’t seek help now. Because after all, I’m getting lower and lower and lower functioning. I’m having an episode like everyday. And I’m a confident person so it’s a bad mix. You do crazy sh!t. They say BPD gets better and easier to deal with when you’re older. Not my case, it’s gotten really bad. It’s too much to deal with, but I always figured I’d probably die in my early twenties. Suicide is the escape plan."
BPD,f8h75n8,t1_f8h2f01,1574570419.0,"Because NPD is abusive at it’s core. It’s very essence. How do you think most of us got BPD to begin with? Most of us got it from an abusive and/or neglectful parent(s) or caregiver who was either a narcissist or had, to some extent as most abusers do, narcissistic traits. It’s worse than psychopathy— at least those people admit they are who they are, a narcissist will never take responsibility for the hell they’ve caused. They can’t see through their own sh;t"

Even when I was with my crazy ass ex I was seeing other guys, but not sleeping with them. Now I am tho. Even got into the habit of stealing other girl’s mans.

I’ve never had a real job in my life and I’m unemployed right now. Yet, I’ve been trying so hard for weeks going to open interviews and job training. No luck. And I recently found out I’m disqualified from ever joining the Marine Corps ever again. So not only am I a homeless youth in a very big city alone with no family but I’m a homeless broke unemployed youth in a big city with MDD, BPD and alcoholism who’s parents don’t help out; and whom can’t go back into the military and who also can’t even go to college yet since I need to find a place to live and a means of making money first. So that’s my dilemma."
BPD,f8h1ce5,t1_f8gz39k,1574568126.0,"Yes, sometimes BPD looks a lot scarier in men. I think I read something not too long ago that said male borderlines tend to be more prone to violence than females with BPD. My ex was more than likely a male borderline. He always self diagnosed himself and identified with being bipolar, and I always tried to tell him that’s not what bipolar is, and you seem more borderline tbh, but ya never know, he came off as a narcissist as well. Very toxic relationship. I was on a date with a doctor who suggested my ex had BPD with nothing more than my description of how he acted. He was jealous, possessive, controlling, severe fear of abandonment, very draining to be around and at times emotionally abusive. He’d often threaten to stab whoever I would leave him for. He’s in jail rn on a First Degree Assault charge which carries a penalty of 5-25 years so he’ll be away for a while. And worst of all, he’s only 19. Yet he threw his life away on an impulse that made him stab some guy. Had another bad experience with a male borderline in the past as well. Now if I think a guy has BPD, I steer clear. I’m pretty good at hiding my symptoms but all the male BPD individuals I’ve known were outwardly crazy and never bothered to act slightly sane."
BPD,f8gzqxd,t3_e0o7al,1574567472.0,"I hear you. My own parents contributed the most I believe to my disorder. Especially my father. And it hurts because when you look back at your parents during your childhood you realize you put so much faith into them and they fucked you up. They abused you, and most family members other than grandparents and siblings even know or see it as abuse. It might sound cold but I don’t love my parents. It’s not because I’m being cruel, but I literally have zero feelings of love toward them. In fact I actually don’t even know how to love anyone or what real love outside of lust means or consists of. 


How I cope: I’m what used to be a mildly discouraged yet success-driven high functioning person with BPD whom it was easy to hide my symptoms. Now, I’m what you would call a ‘low functioning’ person with BPD. Everyday is a struggle now. If I’m not constantly either drinking, getting high, having sex or spending money then I feel empty, which spirals into a depression which leads me to become suicidal, and that’s when I feel like ending it all. It’s a sad vicious cycle. My advice to you (and it won’t be very great, I’m only [almost] 20, I don’t have the best experience), is to do something to take your mind off jumping off a roof. Smoke some weed, binge watch your favorite TV show, watch a comedy, have a drink or two, read a book (although not my cup of tea, it’d just bore me), hang out somewhere, spend some money, go for a walk, listen to depressing music, etc. That’s honestly the best I got."
BPD,f8gxg0l,t1_f8fz3bs,1574566544.0,"In my humble opinion, it seems to me like you might have the disorder. In fact, I speculated that I had BPD before I was ever diagnosed— months later. When I was barely 18, I thought that it was a possibility that I had this BPD thing I had stumbled upon while searching “Bipolar symptoms” and “rapid mood swings” on google.

I guess what I’m trying to get at here is that: you probably do have it if you say the symptoms fit the diagnostic criteria. But what good is a piece of paper or permanent mental health documents in your files gonna do to help your situation? If you think it’ll give you closure and peace of mind like it did for me then go ahead, get diagnosed. But IMO if you already know you have it, what’s the point?

I partially regret that I was diagnosed in 3 separate psych wards. Those are files that don’t disappear. I lose the right to ever legally own a gun (of course I can finesse my way into anything so that doesn’t bother me) and certain occupations I can no longer have. I can’t go back into the military, even though it’s what I was determined to do for years."
