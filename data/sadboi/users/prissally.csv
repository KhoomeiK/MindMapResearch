emotionalabuse,fc9z6kq,t1_fc9xr93,1577560396.0,"Yeah, no one really understands what one goes through, especially with emotional abuse, because it isn't ""really visible"". With me and him, it was on and off for years until one day I decided to cut it off totally, but were in touch as 'friends'(BIG MISTAKE). Within few months, he got control of me totally, and we weren't even in a relationship then. I was so afraid of him and it was all really messed up. Until I finally decided to cut off all contact. Didn't matter how many times he tried contacting me, I blocked him everywhere, he even showed up at my door, but I didn't speak to him at all. He stopped contacting me. Then finally after months he again tried, I contacted back (Again, mistake). The cycle then began again, he tried gaining control again, he started to accuse me of cheating ( we weren't even together) and that was just the start, it was way worse before. So when the little signs started to show, I cut off all contact again. Because I know the whole cycle would repeat again if I let it. And it would keep repeating and there should be and to it someday, so I put it to end. I've decided I'll never let him back in my life. I decided to respect and love myself and not let anyone interfere with my love toward myself."
emotionalabuse,fc9t8mg,t3_egt3sd,1577557873.0,"I've been in a similar situation. And I've realised that getting out of it a 100% requires us to block them off totally from our life. I let him in once or twice after the final stages of breaking up, but then the cycle repeated again. It's been long since this happened and I've been in one other relationship after that. This relationship ended too, but it was amazing while it lasted. I opened up to him about my past abusive relationship and he was very understanding and was very sweet and caring as a person. He was very understanding when I had my triggers and he took real good care of me. So, yes. There are amazing people out there and you will find someone you deserve.. only if you get out totally from this present situation of yours. Wish you all the best for your future."
