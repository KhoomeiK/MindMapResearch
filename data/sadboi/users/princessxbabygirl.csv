relationship_advice,fc1lhzl,t3_efljnv,1577322348.0,"My best advice would be, if you care about her and love her, suggest she seek help (psychiatrist / therapist) & hopefully she works toward getting better , give her some time. If nothing changes in a few months then I would back off a bit. My boyfriend has loved me unconditionally through a lot of similar issues and it’s changed my life for the better. It just depends on how much you love / care about her. I’m sure my boyfriend has felt this way about me at some point but I hit a dead end eventually and did seek help and I’m actively trying to get better every day. It makes a difference."

Every time something doesn’t go my way, or things aren’t perfect, I start imagining how my life would be better moving on from him and go so deep in my mind and closing him off. It takes effort and a lot of self awareness constantly to pull myself back and say simple things to myself, like, “he loves you” “be nice”  and “play the tape” of our happy life together with our pets and how he loves me and how much we have fought through to be together. And it SUCKS because I feel like I have to do this every day or several times a day, but it is what it is. I try my very best to become aware of the situation and the reality."

We can be having a great day and I find myself staring off into space thinking of my traumatic experience and then snap back to reality and I’m like holy fuck this is really my life. I am changed because of it and my distrust of men causes a lot of issues in my life now. I feel like None of them can be trusted. I constantly feel so detached I can’t emotionally connect to anything anymore. But I also question myself too. Idk I just needed to word vomit a little too & thanks for sharing ur post
