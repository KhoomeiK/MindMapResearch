Paranormal,fc7vyk9,t3_egkw42,1577520063.0,"I was home alone one day getting into the hall closet. I suddenly heard a man say ""That's what's up"". It came from the base of the stairs which was just around the corner, VERY close to me. It startled me. All an intruder would have to do is take a few steps and they'd be on top of me. I waited a few seconds straining to hear. I heard nothing else. I walked around the corner. No-one was there. There is no way they could have tip toed in any direction without me hearing them. The stairs creak and the floor is tile. Unless they were barefoot and a cat with clothes that don't rustle when moved I would have heard them. 

I didn't have the courage to investigate further. I had just had hip surgery and was on crutches. I called my SO and made him come home. It was time for his lunch anyhow so it wasn't a huge deal. He scoured the house including the garage and attic with me waiting at the bottom of the stairs. There was nothing. No man, no unlocked Windows or doors and the attic door was still padlocked when he went up there. 

My brother is a junky. He got into some bad dealings with some very bad men. I'll spare the details, but basically there's a hit out on him and he had fled town a year ago at that point. My first reaction to the voice was thinking it was him. It sounded like him and he used to say that phrase all the time. It was annoying. But I knew he was many states away so it couldn't be him. My next thought was maybe he died and he needed to say goodbye in his usual weird fashion. I hadn't heard from him in weeks. I knew he was using again. 

The next day after calling a billion hospitals I was finally able to find him. He was in a medically induced coma. He had OD'd, laid on the floor in the same position for days before someone found him. His kidneys were badly damaged from laying like that for so long. He was bleeding internally and the blood pooled around his kidneys. I'm not sure if somehow he projected, or if that was the voice of someone else intent on me finding him. But I knew that's exactly what I was meant to do.

Sorry if I stole any of your thunder OP. Your story was good and creepy and I was reminded of my own."
