depressed,fqik6kf,t1_fqi4pbb,1589397086.0,"I’m doing quite alright, thank you:)

Update: We found out it wasn’t actually drug related (from testing) and he doesn’t remember saying anything to the doctor about Xanax. I think it was from the first time he tried to OD (he took all of his antidepressants two days before he tried to kill himself a month ago), and that explains the liver damage. They think it was a seizure, which could also have been caused from the drugs he had taken (he has had 3 seizures since his attempt). He is being tested for epilepsy too since his mom remembers when he was younger he had occasional seizures.

I’m just glad that it wasn’t another suicide attempt and that he should be ok eventually:)"

It’s nice to know that friendly strangers will help you get out of a dark place like this. I can’t tell my friends out of respect for him, but I want to talk about it. Bottling it up will make it worse."
depressed,fqc6sf5,t1_fqc3d27,1589251311.0,You’re so sweet<3 last time he was gone everyday I sent him a voice message of how my day went and he loved it. But I also knew he was gonna be gone for a week. This time I think it’ll be longer so I’m not sure what I’m going to do

depressed,fpeol2h,t1_fpeo93t,1588551626.0,"Of course. I’m very sorry you feel this way. Please don’t just give up. If you ever need a support group, I’m always here. Msg me whenever and I can hopefully help. Please don’t feel alone. You’re never alone"
depression,fpeaem7,t1_fpea4d3,1588543574.0,Holy shit that was amazing. I have never heard ANYONE explain something so perfectly. I’m speechless lol
depression,fpe7o8z,t1_fpe67ov,1588541997.0,"I felt that. I thought nothing or no one could help me. In this life we are given too much pressure. We’re told to always think about the future. We’re told to sit down and shut up. We’re told no one cares about us. Then there’s the rest of us who are handed everything on a silver platter. Like, a picture perfect movie life. But that’s not reality. You can’t predict the future, no one can so don’t worry so much about it. Life is meant to be lived day by day. Nothing is permanent. Don’t give up on your future, even if you can’t see one. I now have an s/o who makes me feel like I’m on top of the world. I have no clue what my future holds, but I hope it’s a good one. I hope yours is amazing. I truly wish you the best of luck, stranger. Stay safe and patient:)"
depressed,fpe6d2v,t3_gctoe2,1588541250.0,"I understand this so much. A couple weeks ago my s/o tried to kill themself. I tried to kill myself too 2 years ago. It’s just not worth it. Just because nothing has changed, it doesn’t mean nothing will ever change. Life is fucking insane. It’s unpredictable. I’m assuming you’ve reached out for help before, although I’m a stranger. You don’t seem like you’ve been sitting and waiting for a surprise. Sometimes it seems like nothing is worth it, like it’s not worth fighting. But it is. You giving up will make it worse. I’m not gonna be one of those people saying “get off your ass if you want change, if you want to feel better” cause that doesn’t help. Do you have a stable support group? People that can help you?"
depression,fpe5jge,t3_gcqww5,1588540773.0,"You need to find your passion in life. I still haven’t found it, it might take a while to but you aren’t wasting life. You’re living life. Life is a test. It’s as if we’re the hamsters, those with mental illness. We’re the breed of weirdos that are hard to understand. You’ll find someone of something that gives you purpose. Someone who makes you smile. I might not have found my passion yet, but I have found a partner and I’m beyond grateful. Don’t give up on your dreams, even if you don’t know what those are. No life is a waste. It’s a rollercoaster that sometimes makes you dizzy, sometimes you want to get off, but no matter what, the fight is so fucking worth it. Once you get where you’re meant to be, it feels so good and relieving. No ones life is perfect, no ones mental state is perfect. Perfection is fake, unless you make it a reality. Alter your reality. Alter your life, make it not feel wasted. Hang in there:)"

depression,fn3lazt,t1_fn3jrzb,1586623025.0,That’s what I try to tell him. This isn’t a fast process. I talked to his dad and he is ok. They will be admitting him to a hospital once they get the referral. Thank you.
depression,fn3gnwk,t1_fn3ghqr,1586620359.0,"Yes, he is on medication but they don’t work for him.  He has the occasional good day but most of them are terrible. This self-isolation thing has also really taken a toll on him"
depression,fn3g1id,t3_fyptoo,1586619996.0,"I’m so sorry, I’m the same. At this point I’ve faked for so many years that it doesn’t bother me. I’ve always kept down my emotions, put up a wall because I don’t want people to think I’m a victim. I know I shouldn’t hide it, but it’s just my normal and I can’t stop"
