ARFID,fr3tx05,t3_gmh2p1,1589866164.0,"Honestly, Google is your best bet. ARFID is still considered to be in it's infancy, and is still known by many different names. So you can't necessarily walk into every single psychiatric clinic and expect them to know what it is, let alone establish a treatment plan. 

I would Google 'NY arfid' and try to work with a psychiatrist that specialises in eating disorders (I would stress that it would be important to work with a Dr who has treated patients with ARFID previously) and who maybe also has a dietician on board to help you. Doctors who have worked with those on the autism spectrum may have a leg up, as issues with food is prevalent on the spectrum.

Hopefully someone from NY or The States will be able to help you further. 😊"

No one that is calling for people to stop misgendering Kai think he, or Onision are anything other than horrible, rotten, predators. You can say that you ""lose the privelige to not be misgendered when you're a pedophile"" I'm glad we're all on the same page that those who make the remarks *know it's a harmful, detrimental thing to say to an enby or trans person,*, they don't respect him so they won't refer to him by his pronouns and dead name him. they're giving the message they're willing to ""put up"" with someone's transness until it's something to use against them. Those commenters don't realise how poorly it reflects on them. Nor do they think of the other enby/trans/questioning people who are reading it who have to deal with people discussing how ""real"" or ""fake"" your identity and self come across to strangers, that your husband forced you into this. 

It's the same with comedy; picking on someone's appearance, weight, race, religion, gender, etc is such low hanging fruit, it always comes across as abrasive and insensitive, when there are a myriad of other things to quip about. Especially about literal child predators.

Your best bet (at this current moment in time) is to buy a test (for the virus or antibodies) online from a *reputable* source, as most tests available online are unreliable and expensive.

Sometimes this works, sometimes people have follow up questions, but I've learned that when you say this people *get it* a little more than when I say I'm picky with textures etc. People see that as a conscious choice to make. Because they don't like brussel sprouts, but suffer through, we're being ridiculous babies, right? 
You can explain to her that it causes adverse physical reactions to you; you can't help it but it gives you acid reflux/triggers your gag reflex, sometimes I'll say my ability to not eat x or y, is because of aversion/allergy to an ingredient, at the end of the day it's a health issue. Whether I'm talking about my mental or physical health, it depends on the day and the food lol. 
The best thing you can do, is to let go of the shame you feel for not being able to eat what you deem as normal. The more shame and stress you put on yourself, the less likely you are to make a tangible change or progress. people will always have their opinions on your life, I just choose to take the good intentions from the message, not the shame and embarrassment that I feel.

That being said, it would be foolish to think a journalist wouldn't be nice to their subject while they work with them, so I can understand the frustration. But this is a choice that she made, an interesting perspective to give even if it's hard to stomach being around J&D. a lot of us LGBTQ have thick skin, and like to ask questions and read about people who are bad, or bigoted. It gives me perspective and I would find it an interesting read to try and understand her (primitive) train of thought. To see little things described unabridged from MTV editing.

If you complain and tell them you've fallen ill, they tell you that you must have administered it wrong. That you must have incorrectly injested the bleach. Because they don't *technically* sell the MMS ('patients' aka concerned parents usually make a donation to the 'church'), it's hard to charge them with distribution, and they are also protected in some ways as they're a registered religion, and cannot be discriminated against. Seeing as MMS is the whole crux of Jim Humble's (a literal ex golddigger) faux religion, they call it the elixir of life, to remove MMS from the Genesis II Church is 'impossible', as MMS signifies the religious freedom they have to pursue alternative medicine.

So there's a lot of dichotomy in my brain that I don't truly understand, or forget that my line of thinking can sometimes be distorted for non psychotic reasons. 

I do agree that BPD has almost helped me to pick up a mask a lot better than I think I would have without it. That compulsion to fit in, and to ""pass"" made me learn, mirror and mimic behaviours and social cues. 
I can totally relate to the feelings of thinking someone is mad, because their behaviour feels ""off"", and that by proxy taps into my fear of imposters, etc.  I think you worded it in a really beautiful way, and it's definitely given me a lot to think about in the way that I act, and how I feel.

> Today, 22 patients have been or have been hospitalized for COVID-19. Eighteen persons have been reported dead. Not all of these reported individuals have been hospitalized or have died in the past 24 hours. Some patients are reported later. That is why the data from past days is often supplemented.

> There is an increase in the number of positively tested patients in Sneek. This is due to the cluster of COVID-19 patients in an asylum seekers' center in Sneek, which GGD  Municipal Health Service Fryslan reported earlier this week.

> To date, 42,627 confirmed COVID-19 patients have been reported to the RIVM  National Institute for Public Health and the Environment . The figures match the picture that the measures work. Because not all COVID-19 patients are tested, the actual numbers in the Netherlands are higher than the numbers listed here."

Damn, I mean I was subconsciously aware of that, but I have never paused to think how strange it is. the cultural zeitgeist of ""conspiracy theorists"" usually consisted of way left leaning ideologies, if not out and out hippies/seekers of alternative medicine etc. So it's crazy to think how that the Alt-Right are so prominent in this iteration of conspiracy theorists when the world is running under capitalism, and so many world leaders can fall on the Alt-Right spectrum, if not they can be seen as right wing.

I'm shizoaffective and I've had friends I used to get high with try and make me ""freak out"" by pulling faces, crossing their eyes, doing random shit for a half a second and then going back to normal, or just staring at me with their eyes and mouths wide open, eerily smiling. 

Not to mention the whole ""I can read your mind"" shtick that people love to turn on you once you tell them about it, or any other delusion. I've never told anyone and had them not use it against me.

I don't know anyone who has been 'granted' testing, for lack of a better word. The below was updated yesterday;

>Just take a test to see if you have COVID-19, if you feel sick? It is not quite that simple. Read more about who is eligible for a test and why, and what role RIVM National Institute for Public Health and the Environment plays.

>Who will be tested?

>The testing policy in the Netherlands focuses on specific patients in higher-risk groups, healthcare staff who are caring for vulnerable groups, and teachers and pedagogical employees.

I'm in a risk group and was denied testing when I was having issues with catching my breath. 

>Why is it not currently necessary to test even more people? 

>At the moment, the same measures apply for people with COVID-19 as for people who are not infected but have similar symptoms. That means: stay at home and recuperate. Testing is considered necessary if you actually have COVID-19, and if your symptoms worsen and hospital treatment is required. Also, if you are a healthcare worker, or if you live in an institution with vulnerable people, it may be advisable to get tested.

I couldn't find a concrete number on RIVM about how many people they have tested overall, but I did find an article saying that according to RIVM at the end/mid April there were [""Nearly 181 thousand have been tested for the virus, with 34,842 tests showing a positive result.""](https://nltimes.nl/2020/04/22/netherlands-coronavirus-deaths-tops-4000-10000-hospitalizations), at that rate that's 5 negative tests for every positive. The government refused extra test kits from Germany, every little thing they're doing (to me, at least), just doesn't indicate that they actually intend to increase testing in the way that we would expect, because an increase in testing is the bare minimum that should have happened months ago, like they claimed."

I found that the emotional ""a-ha!"" moment that the main character was supposed to have came way too late into the series to be impactful, and he treats everyone who is so focused on helping him, like shit. It may be a realistic portrayal of grief, but it does not make for compelling television when the MC doesn't grow or become in any way sympathetic or easy to empathise with. I mean, some examples I personally couldn't get past; him *refusing* to call a sex worker by her name, or as a sex worker, referring to her usually as ""the prozzy/prostitute"", giving a homeless and suicidal man money to OD with, being a dick to his brother in law/boss who has lost their sister.

Our brains function on a different scope than other, non psychotic people. So I can see how there can be some traits in us that we don't notice that seem a little strange to other people

The way I see it, neurotypical people are more concerned with keeping up a mask than we are; because we can't often keep up the pretense that we're not seeing/hearing/feeling what we are experiencing, so we get a little more freedom in that aspect. 

Of course, when I was younger I was more concerned with keeping up a 'mask', to not appear strange or abnormal. Now I would much rather people know and accept me for who I am, than to spend all of my emotional energy trying to convince people that I'm not weird as hell."

My periods would be extremely painful and my PMS (because of afformentioned hormonal issues) was disrupting my life. I got told ""periods are supposed to hurt, everyone has cramps, everyone gets PMS"", and silly stuff like that, implying that the symptoms and discomfort felt were normal. I started complaining about symptoms of PCOS around 12, and was diagnosed at around 16, after my blood tests consistently showed hormonal abnormalities, they sent me in to get a vaginal ultrasound to see if there were cysts present on my ovaries, which there were. But my mother had to pester them for the tests, which shouldn't have been necessary since most of the women in my family have it, and I have a lot of symptoms.

Even then I would get dismissive comments like ""if this was a burst cyst you would be in a lot more pain"", to then go to my next ultrasound and see that I had like 50% less than the amount I had before, knowing that I had experienced the pain of a burst cyst lmao. 

I'm glad that you didn't have such a complicated experience!"
