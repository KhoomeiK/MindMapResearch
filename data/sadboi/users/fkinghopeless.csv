BPD,fadtulo,t3_e8chmg,1575986115.0,"Yes, I do. I'm really sorry that you're going through this. I know how much that sucks. I wish I could help you, but I can't, because I'm struggling with it too. Maybe just focusing on getting better/working towards one thing at a time instead of just trying to get your sh*t together all at once..? I don't know. It's hard, because I always tend to do things in extremes. I either don't care about anything and I'm really unproductive or I'm trying to just be the most productive person and then I get tired and it becomes an endless cycle of just not caring at all and then stressing over everything..
 But just know that you're not alone. Let's just take things slowly and enjoy the rest of the year."

BPD,f7w3vxy,t3_dxsko5,1574029597.0,"I'm really sorry that you're feeling this way. I'm in high school and I actually feel the exact same way. Honestly? Don't give up, even if it was just to see what happens. Maybe things will get worse but what if they get better? You never know. I know how hard it is.. You're not alone even tho it feels like you are. We can do this.  
My plan is to just hold on for as long as possible and trying to find something that brings me joy even if it's just for a short time. Please don't lose hope. Just take care of yourself, take baby steps. Try to find yourself again. What I find really helpful is just writing down my thoughts and feelings. When I feel like talking to someone but I can't talk to anyone because I don't really have friends. Or making lists of goals or things I wanna get better at/change ..something like that. Sorry I didn't really give you any tips, I wish I could do more. I'm still figuring it all out. 
 I'm sending love <3 I hope it's gonna get better soon. Stay strong."
bettafish,f7rg1gh,t1_f7p5d9d,1573980718.0,"Yeah definitely! I lost two of my bettas in July (they were my first bettas ever) and I was really sad. I thought I would never find any betta which I'd love as much as I loved Atticus and Sunny (my bettas that passed away). But I did. Skyler is a combo of their personalities and looks and he's making me smile everyday.  When I was checking him out at the store I was kinda overthinking it like.. 'would I give him a good home?' and things like that.  And after I bought him and had him for a while, he started changing his colors and I was worried that I was doing something wrong, but turns out he's happy and he's just showing his true colors. <3"

bettafish,f7regag,t1_f7p6mjw,1573979877.0,"Yup, thank you. When the sun hits his body, he's still shiny and blue but when I take regular photos on my phone's camera, he only looks black."
