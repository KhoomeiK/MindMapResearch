selfharm,evs9j9o,t1_evrsinf,1564736452.0,"Hey, I know how it feels when you are really suicidal, but you. have. value. Whether you see it or not, you are unique in ways that other people never will be.  You brain will try to trick you into not seeing anything good about yourself, but I think you probably are a way more caring, and observant person that most. And the world could use more people like that. I‚Äôm assuming that because of your pain, you would never want to treat someone like that, so you probably treat people with kindness that they may not experience often. And hey, maybe all my assumptions are wrong, but even so, there will always be something about you that is special, and good in this world. Please don‚Äôt leave this world, I‚Äôm here, and you can always talk to me."

Drugs,esbqrdb,t3_c11zrt,1561807115.0,"Hey :( that sounds absolutely awful, I‚Äôm sorry you went through this. It‚Äôs been about two weeks since you posted this, and I hope you‚Äôre doing better. I‚Äôm praying for you, and I believe in you!! Getting help is scary but it really helps, so I highly encourage you to get a therapist if possible. You can get through this! And is there any way you could see a different doctor? All the effects your body seems to have is really concerning, and a professional should be informed of it. Anyways, good luck!"
