asktransgender,fokbtgl,t1_fojjbtd,1587839139.0,"Hmmh I do have other complicating issues, I struggle with Major Depression and GAD and I used to struggle with ADHD but I thought it might have been a misdiagnosis and my therapist hasn’t mentioned it.

Don’t worry though, she knows now and we’re going to have to discuss it whether I like it or not haha. 

Im not sure what else would be causing this pain other than dysphoria :/ but I understand your sentiment and believe it may be worth looking into.

The nature of the situation is less that I feel I raped her, and more that the dysphoria is exacerbated by the fact that a girl that I cared about, and still do, felt violated by me for a body part that I despise in the first place. But it’s a part of me and I can’t remove it. It just sits there silently while it adds horror after horror to my life.  

I guess the fact that it wasn’t rape doesn’t matter to me because I understand why she feels that way and still attribute guilt for it because the parts that violated her are parts that are attached to my body. 

I’ve already hormonally and socially transitioned but it’s like my body won’t let go and it hurts? I guess? Sorry, these feelings are really complicated, and that may be one of the reasons for the extreme amount of impulsivity, it was just too much."

MtF,fo7rf8w,t3_eo35qi,1587583256.0,"So this “fetish” caused me to transition (with LOTS of doubts that I could have done without), and now I’m taking care of my body in ways that I NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FATHOM before HRT.

I’m doing yoga, I’m doing my hair, I’m cleaning my teeth, I’m taking my meds on time, I’m showering regularly, I’m even sticking a needle in my butt every 2 weeks, I almost faint every time! I never used to do this on T as a guy. If it’s a fetish, I would say it has been one of the most POSITIVELY influential things in my life.

Although I thought it was a fetish when I was younger, now that I’ve transitioned I can see that it’s as much of a fetish as wanting to have sex with someone of a certain gender is. It has literally transformed my life and become the basis for my HEALTHY relationship with my body. If that sounds like a fetish, than a fetish has saved my life.

For the record though, I had some pretty disgusting fetishes in youth before I transitioned that went away but somehow the “autogynephelia” stayed. I don’t think it’s a fetish, I think it was my body and brain operating like they are supposed to and the actual fetishes were a result of dealing with the trauma of the disconnect of having a male body.

I know the confusion and doubts are hard and I know my experience is different just like everyone else. I hope this helps!"

Like you suggested, I feel like there is not a solid purpose for me to exist and it does feel pointless. I’m trying to wrap my head around optimistic nihilism, and I have seen the Kurgesagt video and it’s helpful I think I just need time, and a good book about it. Maybe that’s just what I need and then I can move on? I feel like I will be dealing with this question for the rest of my life, and the more I think about it the more it hurts? I don’t know if that makes sense. Maybe I should show this to my therapist and see. 

Due to the nature of the question, I’m not sure if another therapist would help. Although the thought has occurred to me that I might need to talk to a different therapist. 

On the topic of other therapists I just don’t know who I would talk to, I haven’t been able to find a therapist around that has actually lived as a trans person, and around here there’s around a 50% chance that the next therapist I find will actually try to convince me I’m not trans for their beliefs, or discriminate like some I’ve had in the past. My therapist has expressed to me a sentiment very similar to yours: That she has trouble understanding because she doesn’t have the experience, and I guess that’s why I feel I just have to deal?

Again, thank you so much for answering and providing your perspective. I think I can get through this, I just needed a little push. :)"

I hate that I basically have to guess how to do my own hormones and be frightened to death that I could start remasculinuzing at any time (which does happen sometimes) because I messed up a shot or didn’t shove a pill up my butt in time, or even just because my body decides based on my workout routine or diet that it just wants to make more testosterone for some reason.

I hate that I can’t afford anything, I can’t even afford a 1 bedroom apartment WITHOUT hormones and transgender stuff to deal with. I can barely afford to live with friends because of all of the labs and therapy and hormones and medical bills from mental hospitals and shit.

I hate that I’m constantly worried that I don’t pass. I hate that sometimes I have to cover my genitals because I will go into a fit of self harming rage when I see it in the bathroom. I’ve tried to draw happy faces and clouds and stars and hearts around it on my thighs and it makes me feel a little better when I’m having those thoughts but they are just so strong. 

I hate that sometimes people will confront my manager when I go to the women’s bathroom because “they shouldn’t let a man go in the women’s bathroom” but what the hell else am I supposed to do, I have boobs, hips, I look mostly like a woman, I don’t belong in the men’s bathroom because I’m not a man anymore.

I hate that sometimes it takes me from 11:00am to 5:00pm to get out of bed because I don’t want to go to the bathroom or really do anything because of how I feel. Which was, of course, today.

I just did yoga so I feel a lot better, but some days it’s just so goddamn hard and I just want to die. I’ve wanted to die for as long as I have known what death is. I’m seeing a therapist but therapy isn’t really helpful right now.

So I’m MTF and your absolutely right, I was assigned male at birth and raised to be male, I’m not really sure to what extent women differ from men. These feelings are very complicated, are my feelings typical for a woman, for a man, both? I’ve felt like a woman for a long time, so maybe all my thoughts are that of a woman’s because I am a woman, maybe not because I was born and raised as a boy.

What happens when you mix hormones into your brain? I know for a fact that hormones change your brain chemistry because as far as I know, I have experienced it, some of the ways that male puberty changed my brain were very traumatizing, could this be an indication that my brain has never been that of a guys, or at least never fully?

This is all tough to think about, even for someone who has gone through transition, but I hope this answers a bit of your question.

Before anybody answers, I am going through therapy, and I’m trying to work this out myself lol. And to what that Kodak  fox person said at the bottom, I do feel it deeply, and therefore don’t really feel that I fully belong in men’s or women’s spaces, there definitely is a lot of shame associated with these feelings."
therapy,flmybve,t3_ej2nzz,1585301830.0,"Try to think about it this way, a good teacher will not be mad at you for messing up a problem, or even several, right? A good therapist will not be mad at you for missing a single appointment. I would say that a good therapist may not even be mad at you for missing several appointments.

If your teacher or your therapist don’t like it or want to stop seeing you because of it, it is an indication that you should stop seeing them, as behavior like that is an indication that your therapist may be doing note harm than good.

So you don’t have to feel bad if they act like this.

Other than that, I would suggest talking to a therapist, but know from someone else that I believe may have had similar thoughts that there is nothing wrong with you. Humans are animals and as such do some pretty abnormal things. Especially when consciousness is thrown into the mix.

So takeaways:
Don’t beat yourself up for it, humans are humans, not machines.

Keep a journal to get to the bottom of the thoughts.

Seek therapy, but you can use that as a last resort if you want to because I know it’s expensive."

I have been on and off of hormones and self destructing for 3 years with an unsupportive partner in a codependent relationship and now Ive been consistently on hormones for 4 months. I’ve started to actually be happy with my life and now that ive split I can finally be myself instead of being me+her.

There’s going to be a lot of baggage you have to sift through so ill try to give tips. Keep in mind that I’m young (24) and have a different perspective and much less experience with life.

I dont know how long you have been on HRT, but even with 4 months I have noticed change after change that has surprised me and chipped away at my dysphoria.  For me HRT is very important and makes this possible in the first place. But if I forget a single dose I get caught in something I call a depressive loop, where I forget more often because I’m heavily depressed and I’m more depressed because I miss really often. So please try not to waste time by forgetting doses. It can be really harmful to your mental health.

I suggest obviously seeing a therapist, but there’s lots of self help things you can do before hand, you can, for instance, start a journal when you feel just a little better and carry that through the times when your depressed, it can help you better describe yourself and your emotions, it will shed light on a lot of things that are making you depressed and allow you to focus on them. Like your financial situation, school, mental health, and HRT APPOINTMENTS!

I use an iPhone app called Daylio for my journal, and for bonus points you can get a planner and get even more focus on tasks that you need to do to better your situation.

Know that you will get through this, now that your not in a relationship you can work on yourself, make your situation better, improve your mental health and your view of yourself and finally start living your life authentically.

Again, not all this info could be useful for your situation but I thought I would try to help.
Let me know if you have questions or if I said something harmful."

asktransgender,fh53b71,t3_ewfogg,1581284654.0,"Hmmh some of the things you say sound very similar to my experience, I was into transformation porn, maybe still am. I specifically got off to the idea of having a female body, I felt a strong urge to dress in women’s clothes and sometimes tried, but I felt very creepy and hated it. I love the feeling of smooth skin, estrogen made my skin smoother and I love it. I also felt depressed and attempted suicide at least once with most suicide methods and just before going on hormones built an exit bag which I still have but haven’t thought about in forever. I almost never feel depressed after about 4 months constantly on estrogen (whether this is dissociation or not I’m not sure.) I was attracted to women before estrogen and now I’m either not attracted to anything or only to men.

I could grow a beard but found that I could not fathom the possibility, too much dysphoria. I still hate my penis, but don’t actively try to remove it anymore after estrogen because I’m less depressed and it’s smaller. I really don’t like porn at all, maybe erotica and everything on /r/transformation

I overall am very happy with myself as a woman, and if I had known that I would feel this way I would not have given transition any doubt. I tell you this because my story seems very similar to yours. Lmk if you have questions im happy to answer them!

One of the biggest reasons I took the leap is because I thought to myself “if I’m gonna commit suicide, why not just try to transition and if it doesn’t work out just commit suicide then”...
