ADHD,evsdk6g,t3_ckyjbo,1564742043.0,I'm 33 and was diagnosed earlier this year. I could have written the same as you. It has been a really slow titration with my meds. I'm finally starting to see the benefits and I can't believe this is what I've been missing my whole life. I've made such a mess of everything - particularly my finances and my career - and it could have been avoided. BUT I'm here and I'm improving now and I know it wasn't all my fault.
ADHD,evsdauo,t3_ckwfr8,1564741706.0,Omg this is has been such a blessing and curse for me over the years. I got the internet when I was 15 and it was all downhill from there! I am an expert on a hundred different things but I have no focus in my career. My medication is reaching the right dose now so maybe that will change lol
depression,erhr5in,t1_erg07us,1560881090.0,I could have written that. I've been so lost since about age 13 and I don't think I'll ever find my way back.
