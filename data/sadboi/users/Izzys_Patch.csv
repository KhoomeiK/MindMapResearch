relationship_advice,etq0yb2,t3_ccxag6,1563069592.0,No hang on. He’s probably just joking. Also this was taken out of context we reddit browsers don’t know how your relationship is with your boyfriend. So don’t trust anyone because we don’t know anything.
relationship_advice,etpzwyg,t3_ccxcw4,1563068858.0,"Sounds like she’s either trying to be funny but honestly it all matters on the rest of your interactions. This was kinda taken out of context. How y’all talk to each other. what you do, all of that. And no offense but really this isn’t the best place to get advice. Just keep getting to know her. Be nice and friendly and don’t come on too strong.  And if you do want to start something you don’t have to be blunt” hey I like you” or “ wanna go out some time” nah do some hand touchy things. Anyway she was probably trying to be funny but you don’t know what tone she meant it in. It all depends on everything."
