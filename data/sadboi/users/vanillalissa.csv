Even if she is having a legitimate panic attack (doubtful), that doesn’t excuse her behavior at all. She needs to deal with the consequences.

I dealt with an alcoholic, manipulative roommate but was forced to split as the property management put both our names on the check. When I asked the property management about it, they were very sympathetic but said they had to do that because both of our names were on the lease even though the dings were from him. Depending on the size of your deposit it may just be worth having the property manager handle the split with separate checks if they can and stay as hands off as possible."

Username? I like vanilla, simple as that. :-)

Where are we? In Arkansas. Specifically where we are it's hard to find a RE--we have to travel out of state to the closest one so right now we are working directly with an OBGYN. It is amazing what we take for granted... this would have never been an issue had we still lived in MN (specifically the Twin Cities).

TTC journey? I had my IUD removed early this year, and my husband and I have been trying for about 10 months now but realistically only six cycles. Right now I am medicated on letrozole 2.5mg for its second cycle.

Medical concerns? I have PCOS and migraines."
TryingForABaby,faxqh59,t1_fax9qhr,1576387982.0,"Honest opinion here too. Mine didn't need an ultrasound, but my removal was painful as hell too. It probably would have hurt less or not at all with the assistance of an ultrasound. That being said, it was over quickly. I can assure you a painful removal is not the norm. You don't really see those stories because it's relatively rare. 

I second the hot pad, it is a lifesaver should you need it."

Look at how the video recorded not just A & J but their friends and family. The small interactions and defining characteristics. Photographers will get that to a degree but not in the same vein a video will. We were adamantly against a video and didn’t even budget for it until we started thinking about it from that aspect. It’s well worth it. 

Granted, their video looks like it included the rehearsal dinner. There’s still plenty to be captured the day of the wedding :-)"

YTA because you’re essentially blaming your half-sister for your dad cheating on your mom years ago. She did not get to choose her birth parents. She was not responsible for the cheating. Don’t punish her for something she didn’t do.

It’s your money—do what you want. But YTA for the way you are handling it."
AmItheAsshole,exhyesm,t3_cstt2a,1566317047.0,"NTA - your friends are. I think enough people have commented on why that I don't need to expand further. I don't think your boyfriend is one because he just may have different financial goals than you. 

Now I do think if your relationship continues to progress you should discuss finances with your boyfriend. Not necessarily $ amount but financial goals. It sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders but where is he at? Is he doing ok or is he carrying debt like credit cards? These are all things you will want to know and discuss eventually *before* progressing forward in a relationship (like marriage).

Since you're just dating still it isn't critical, just something to keep in mind. Finances can make or break a relationship pretty quickly and that typically happens when there isn't communication."

YTA for actively seeking to put someone further into debt because you can't read or abide rules.

Your husband is right. 

The silver lining is you posted this on the internet on a very popular subreddit."

I would seriously look into it if you’re considering Bentonville. 8th st kind of sucks to drive on right now but I think there are projects planned to expand it? I’m not really in tune with that part.

Only downside with the promenade area is you’re competing with chains like Coldstone and Andy’s (think better Culver’s frozen custard). Not the same, I know, but not everyone thinks that way. That being said I don’t think there is an artisan ice cream shop actually in the promenade shopping mall. (Also, the two I listed are on the other side of the interstate and closer to the AMP.)

The actual Pinnacle Hills Promenade mall: It’s an outdoor shopping area with mid to upper range stores like Dillard’s (blend of Macys/Nordstrom’s), Sephora, Pottery Barn and more.

I see a lot of comments talking about the quantity not making an alcoholic. Alcoholism doesn't discriminate on quantity; it's about the need/addiction. Someone who needs that one drink every night can be an alcoholic, but a person who enjoys getting trashed every weekend isn't necessarily one (although there are definitely other potential health issues with the latter). Your comment about being able to pick your wife over the booze clearly shows you don't need the alcohol so that isn't a comment about you specifically but might give some insight. She might think you ""need"" that beer after a stressful day even though you don't."
