AskReddit,fqtj437,t1_fqtf5dq,1589640012.0,"Out of a hot shower your capillaries are dilated and your blood is closer to the surface of your skin. When you step out of the shower your blood radiates the temperature outwards, which makes you feel warm but releases all your heat outwards, because the transference is by air it takes a while and by the time you acclimatise you have already lost a lost if heat.      
If you finish off a hot shower with cold water (with a temperature gradient so it doesn't shock you) then the transference is faster via water. Your capillaries close and the blood moves away from the surface, this keeps your blood warmed from the shower without losing much of it to the atmosphere. Your skin will also feel less of a temperature shock from the cold air so it won't feel as cold as it did before the shower, basically your skin will be used to the cold both before and after the shower but after you will be full of warmed-up blood.       

The same principle applies when you are feeling a bit cold or can't warm up, if you go outside for 5 mins in light clothing then come back in you will feel a lot warmer inside and more comfortable.     
In this case you have already been warming yourself up but you can't feel it because it was so gradual, if you shock yourself with cold for a few mins then go back inside, you will feel the room and your body are actually warm."

Matthew is a 'Host' and Edith is a 'Spirit', I knew they were intertwined. I thought it was empathic magic but seems it's a kind of parasitic magic?       
By process of elimination, Guillarme (?) is the giant who is apparently a Fae. And all this time without a description I thought he looked basically like a Golem with an aspect of Darkness, but gentle like an Ent.       

       
Yeah, I didn't give too much thought to the ritual places as people were chatting and I thought they'd get into it more than me, but a lot of people were saying things I didn't know about. Anyway, really glad to know that the ones that came via Thread are the mysterious ones, I'm sure I would have noticed that. I'll have to go back and have a look.          

Regarding the Fae, the giant was Above Summer and the winged one was Autumn, I'm guessing there is a Seelie and Unseelie thing here with the winged one being almost 'bad'. Seelie is summer/good fae i.e dewdrop fairies, elves, fauns. Unseelie is associated with winter/bad fae i.e hobgoblins, trolls, kelpies.         

John is interesting as a 'dog of war', I have no idea what that means, but when Matthew had to specify it wasn't an order if he took the goblins somewhere quiet I'm guessing he's the handyman by nature.        
But, it seems like he's the guy you're scared of coming after you because you see how competent he is throughout the story, until after a long battle you defeat him only to find out he's just the one they sent because the real one is overkill.

DestinyTheGame,fqeijkv,t3_ghx9xt,1589308132.0,"I want more lore. I want the clans and their politics to make an appearance again. I want real ingame differences between them so when I see some with different weapons or with a theme (traps/revolution/tech/religion/modded servitors or deconstructed servitor tech strapped to them etc) I want to actually be able to tell which house I'm fighting and not just the same old but with different colours.        


I don't know much of the lore because it's kind of jumbled, but house of Wolves = mercs? House of Kings = stability/trying to go back to the old days? House of Winter = cast out?             
I don't really remember, but maybe that's why the strikes and public events should reflect that, all I know is I kill fallen because they're there/I go to their ship and kill them because they make us uncomfortable or they're Wanted. What if only a specific house was taking resources because they're trying to make an empire again, what if there was a bodyguard clan that rented out their services as guards similar to the ones that were allied with the awoken, or there were sneaky ones that had only been trying to get info like ninjas because they wanted to find out more about how their home was destroyed.       
All these separate things seems to be lumped into all fallen, all differences in the lore fall away when we fight them as they're all homogeneous. Apart from scourge, if a bunch of fallen dropped on me I'd have no idea who they are or what they want, I'd just shoot em.        

I definitely want a fallen themed expansion, and to find out about the early days of their homeworld. What were they like before the traveller, how did the traveller affect them, do they want the traveller back or do they hate it. What does the traveller normally do for a species when it isn't dealt a death blow and has to release the ghosts.        


The fallen are without a doubt the most interesting species. We are inundated with hive lore but their background isn't interesting it just added onto not much, 'great, this insect-themed race evolves to be more powerful and the leaders made a pact with another insect thing that let them evolve in different ways to be even more powerful with space magic.'."

I noticed when Miss said she found Avery first that it was right after she talked about her loneliness-induced depression. We also got a glimpse of Lucy, walking in after her parents fought, to see her mum with a deeply wounded expression.     Verona lost her mum and has a dad that seems to lay guilt if things aren't to his liking.         
I'm guessing that to be a practitioner you have to 'have something missing' or that 'magic comes from hurt' as the Magicians series says.         

Lucy seemed to come from a wary childhood which maybe why she is defensive and has a knife to protect, also her like of police procedurals, but she seems to be fine.         
Avery suffered from being a shy introvert born into a large extroverted family, lost in a sea of faces/hard to make connections, until she did and is now fighting for them.      
Verona doesn't seems to have any specific issues but it was brought up that she had three skulls in her room, Wildbow wants us to know this and not just that the skull she brought came from her room. This shows some slight fascination with death/gothic tendencies, plus she's very particular with her clothing, said she'll jump in with both feet to the magic world, and puts things off till the last minute according to her dad.         
I think her issues are deep-rooted and haven't made themselves known to her yet, but I think she will be the type to knuckle down or put her head in the metaphorical sand. We'll probably get a lot of story tension from her or her actions later on."

Wildbow could literally have had her come out flushed, had Lucy jibe her by asking her why she's out of breath when she only came down one flight of stairs, have Avery blush furiously, then finish up with Verona saying to leave her alone and say something along the lines of it being an open secret she likes Ms. Hardy.        
Also ties nicely into the 'Show, don't tell' motto of most writers.         


Having a problem with a character/storytelling is down to how it's presented, and it's not up to others to misinterprete that as hate towards others. I could go on about my friends/college friends but I don't need to prove anything because I'm talking about the intricacies of a story, not defending my views over lgbtq representation.

Parahumans,fq5rpt3,t3_ggvrik,1589115626.0,"I think, because the others said the girls would have power via the others giving it to them, that Matthew did that with Edith and took it too far potentially turning him into one of them. Apparently they're arguable cases which makes me think they were fine until whatever happened that was 'a decision' in Matthew's words.    

Edit - what if Matthew was a practitioner who was foresworn and his penalty was to be a slave, to Edith, but they have a romantic relationship so it was the nicest penalty they could give. It explains why he kept asking her to use his power, and your theory that he was the one who lied for them.       
What if all the others are extremely evil and they killed the last practicioner who had power over them, since then every practitioner they've had they struck this deal and when they find out how evil the others are the others try their hardest to make them foresworn and get a different one in."

Parahumans,fq37ouz,t3_gg8fmr,1589063782.0,"Okay, so the Carmine beast died 5 weeks ago and Charles had his yearly curse contributed 5 weeks ago. Plus the Carmine beast is one of the spirits that decide if you're Forsaken or not.       
Everything is pointing to Charles being the killer, but he seemed quite thankful actually, so I don't think it was him. I'm guessing someone else broke an Oath and tried to kill the Carmine beast to avoid it.        
I think it was Matthew or Edith that broke their Oath and their partner killed the Carmine beast to protect them without their (the Oathbreaker's) knowledge.         


On the night of the death, it might come up that Charles was conspicuously absent, however I think the opposite. Miss is seeming a higher lever of power and can/appear quickly, so it makes sense she would be there. Mathew and Edith don't have an obvious reason to be there, unless Miss invited them, and don't seem to have a great amount of power.      
Matthew's power seems to be sympathetic, he took on Louise's pain/symptoms, and he asked Edith at every point as if they were linked. His power was probably needed to be able to affect a great Other like the Carmine beast by transferring harm to it, so I guess Matthew is most likely to be the murderer. He/they then presumably followed it to collect its power, but found Miss there which prevented them.             


Now I think about it, Edith's eyes are noted to be glowing and something happened that made them different and unable to be the practitioner for Kennet.    
 Maybe Matthew was the next practitioner and he drew power from Edith, they formed a relationship perhaps possible due to her powers being empathetic, and Matthew had to do something to help her which ended up giving up more of himself and becoming more like her/Other.         


Lastly, I just want to note, Wildbow didn't give us a map for no reason. The Carmine beast went past the restaurant and the gas station and ended up at the arena.      
 I'm willing to guess that he was heading in a straight line towards this clearing the girls are in at the bottom of the map. Either because it knew it needed a ritual place to shrug off the curse/link, or it wanted the help of one of the Others there."

Lol, tbh I love it. I really get on board with Wildbow saying he wants hints more obviously realised are hints.      
Like on TV shows, it shows someone murdering someone else and they still say 'you're killing them? Are you the badguy? Did you do these other things that are now obviously linked back to you because you're the badguy? Because you've been killing people in this specific way? Because you're the badguy?'."
