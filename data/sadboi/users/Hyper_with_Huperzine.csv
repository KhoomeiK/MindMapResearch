Only then was I able to convince my parents that therapy would be good for me. 

My therapist says I definitely have some form of bipolar, but she doesn't know where to place me yet. 

It looks like bipolar 1 is most likely considering the severity of the mania... with psychosis and blackouts. 

She says I'm stable right now, and that I was really smart for finding my own solution when no one else would help me, and my problems had been ignored for so long.

The perfect thing would be if someone found studies of an NAA forming enzyme that was decreased, and we could trace that back to the cause of the problem.

We are completely sane and often more rational than others... Until... That is we have a manic, depressive, or psychotic episode. 

I'll answer your questions out of order, because that'll make it easier to unfold my narrative...

So.

I discovered my disorder last year, senior year of high school, my first psychotic break.

It starts with some discomfort, you feel the air shift around you. Things slowly change, the world is different, not like it should be. 

There's no real word for that feeling, it's uneasy, walking and thinking straight start to get difficult. 

Over the course of a few months you start to have odd thoughts, you know you're not your normal self, there's something wrong but, it's getting difficult to communicate. 

No one around you understands, and you start to slip faster and faster. 

Time breaks, like a laggy connection in video games. Except your losing entire hours, only to find out you were skipping through the hallway...smiling while crying.

You don't know who you are, or where your friends went. 

For me, i tried to get the help of one of my friends, in between fits of uncontrollable emotion, extreme confusion, hallucinations, and getting lost in my own home. 

The only thing I managed to do is confuse her. Then think she understood my rambling. Speaking is stressful, you have to plan your words hours ahead of time.

 It doesn't matter how hard you try, everything falls to pieces. Your friends dont understand your rambling so they laugh nervously. 

You being scared, and having tried to ask for help, are now in a fit of rage. You're crying, sobbing, like a child's temper tantrum. Everyone sees you. Now they laugh, because what kind of mature 19 year old suddenly breaks down crying, and screaming in the middle of a class room. 

You think that they're laughing at your torment. You feel betrayed, but worse than that, you feel kicked down by the closest thing, closest person you've ever had to family, in the one time you need it most. Because no one... Will ever understand, just how difficult it is. 

But you were so happy before, life was just starting to look up. All you wanted was to make your friends smile. To be kind and giving. But now everyone thinks you're insane, and weak, and they hate you. 

But you still love them, and maybe you are weak because you wanted to rely on someone else. One time. You 

Your memory is kind of in and out for a bit there. Eventually, a few months later you just wake up.
With memories this time, just pieces. 

No one really accepts you anymore, and sometimes your parents still make fun of the things you did. They know it's not normal, you ask them to understand, but they refuse to get you any form of therapy. While ignoring you everyday. 

So instead you try to pay for therapy yourself, using cash from the business you started. This is when you learn about the disorder for the first time.

 The crippling loneliness, and belief that you're the only one... It slowly melts. But during the depressive phases it still tears your heart out every once in a while. 

All of this happens, when you're a straight a+ student, with a six pack, perfect nutrition, 12+ supplements, and nootropics. 

-Who taught your self cognitive behavioral therapy, and neurolinguistic programming. Anything you could do to keep your mental health straight, and its still not enough.

Because, psychosis tends to be unpredictable, it can happen at any time to anyone, no matter how hard they try, no matter how mature or kind, or honest they are...
 
And when it happens it destroys everything youve ever cared about. You have to rebuild your entire life, all alone. While wondering if anyone could ever love something as crazy as you.
