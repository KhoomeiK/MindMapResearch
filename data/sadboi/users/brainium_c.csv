dating_advice,fdc51me,t1_fdc3yel,1578267246.0,"Well In my situation, I posted somthing on reddit (like you did) asking for advice and then sent her the link, she called me and we spoke for a while. I don't think I done it the best way tbh.

With stuff like this its really hard to plane out the right moment to tell her. It's best just to say it when it feels right. Don't beat around the bush and tell her how you feel. 

It's really difficult but people appreciate honesty. Just get your piont across clealy"
dating_advice,fdc3kwf,t1_fdc36ja,1578266426.0,"Listen, if your friendship with her is that strong you to should be able to remain friends afterwards. So if you ask her out and it goes well then great but if it doesn't go well you can still be friends. It will be a little but awkward at frist but you'll get past it (if your friendship is strong)

You'll will most likely regret not taking the risk."
