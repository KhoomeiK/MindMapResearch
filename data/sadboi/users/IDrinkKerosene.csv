RBI,fox0pce,t1_fowtu8c,1588131316.0,"yeah but I don't think they would think that ""god"" could die from a heart attack. kim Jong il died from one. it just raises a question that he may be since his sister is rising in power quite quickly. one point that may contradict that could be that only Kim can rise people up in power.  


the biggest thing to tell is that since she is rising up in power so quickly, Kim may not have much longer to go. I would most likely estimate 1-2 months if he is announced alive since the botched heart surgery was confirmed."
RBI,fowt378,t1_fowst0c,1588126558.0,i understand your reasoning on that. now it would be great if he died but there could also be the case where she was wanting this at the end anyways to make the country a better place. there is always that possibility. I know its too early but the video was claimed that it aired on an official Korean news station and it would be good to get to the bottom of that or at least see the video

Would you rather have lingering pain or would you rather have a shot of pain and then no more. For you the pain is getting worse because the blood may be clotting around the string more and more and so it would get harder and with your mouth moving it could cut the inside of your gums Which there will be more blood and clotting and the cycle repeats. Look you gotta get this thing out no matter what. If you are able to go to the store try getting toothache cream. That stuff completely numbs your gums so to lessen the pain do that before you pull. Keep the leftover string because of how much pain you endured you can sue the company if you want to. Just try it. And plz update me on this.
