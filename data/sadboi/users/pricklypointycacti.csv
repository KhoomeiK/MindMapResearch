Obviously, I understand that any adult who purchases sex from a minor and taking advantage of them is not the epitome of a good person."
TrueCrimeDiscussion,fqptmnp,t1_fqpqbk5,1589553755.0,You worded it better than me. He definitely did use his position working with children in order to have access to them. It was a way for him to have a socially acceptable persona.
adultsurvivors,fqpn0b9,t3_gk7qsb,1589550085.0,"As someone who suffers from hyper-sexuality due to being molested as a child, I can say that I can relate to you when you say you want to reclaim your body and give it to anyone who shows you interest. I cannot judge you and say to not go for it, because that is how I cope with things. 

But since you’ve said that you’ve only had one sexual partner in your life, I would definitely proceed with caution. Don’t be surprised if these people *only* want sexual relations with you. Be safe as well. Even though it is just casual sexual encounters, you have the right to say no at any time and back away if things are uncomfortable. Don’t let anyone make you feel like just because you’re engaging in casual sex that you’re not worthy of respect and decency."

This was only when he was drunk, because then he would say things like I look my mother and we’re both ugly, good for nothing whores. This is why to this day I have such a huge issue with compliments. I’ll accept them for the sake of social conventions but inside, I feel a deep rage. Even when I was younger, I did not like people complimenting me, even for the smallest thing. Abuse definitely warps the mind of the one the abuse has been inflicted on."

CPTSD,fpdsoq3,t3_gckt3l,1588533442.0,"I remember being eight or nine years old and a bootlegger came to the table where me and my parents were eating at a restaurant. He was selling cheap DVDs. A lot of the movies were still in theaters and not released on DVD. My mom let me pick out a movie since the man charged only $5 for each DVD. I chose the movie Precious with Gabourey Sidibe. I remember relating immensely to Precious, however my mind did not make the connection until I was nineteen years old. The reason I kept watching that movie over and over again was because I was also being sexually abused by my father. My mind wouldn’t let me remember until I was older."
TrueOffMyChest,fp9uwor,t3_gc05zt,1588435064.0,I remember my father used to drive drunk with me in the car as a little girl. I remember being about six or seven and getting thrown around the backseat because i didn’t have a seatbelt on and he was swerving the car. I always prayed he would do something to someone just so the abuse at home could stop. At least he would be arrested for it. But reading this made me feel bad.

I have a lot of Puerto Rican and Dominican friends and don't feel strange when I hear them or their families speak, even if it is the males. But as far as the abuser's dialect, it can be recognized instantly. Best of luck to you on your journey to recovery. You're on the right step already by learning about these triggers."

However, I don't get triggered every time I hear Spanish being spoken. Only if its from my abuser's home country and only if it's the men speaking. I disassociate and start internally panicking. Sometimes I have to leave and silently cry and collect myself in the nearest restroom. My abuser spoke to me in Spanish as well. I don't have any advice to give because I am currently dealing with the same. I just want to thank you for your post however, I've never been able to admit to anyone that hearing my own language can trigger me immensely. Thank you for being brave enough to share on Reddit.

rutgers,fa9miqx,t3_e7qrbj,1575880358.0,"you can always take a leave of absence. there's nothing wrong with that, especially when your mental health is being affected. think of it this way - you're able to recognize that you've changed since starting college. college is a transition in life, and as with all transitions, come with good and bad. you'd be surprised how NOT alone you are. taking a leave of absence doesn't make you a quitter, nor should it make you feel like you're different than your peers. 

I recognized the same feelings of depression and suicidal ideation when entering my first year, first semester at Rutgers too. I was also doing pretty well academically. it was just my mental health just severely declining. but I was stubborn. I didn't want to take a leave of absence because I was so firm on graduating on time. I ended up staying until second semester of sophomore year when a mental breakdown led me to take a medical leave of absence in the middle of the semester. if you feel like your mental health is adversely affective and that therapy combined with schooling would be too much for you right now, don't be afraid to take a leave of absence. you can use those months to focus solely on your mental health and preparing for a school year filled with successes. you will get through this. if you haven't already, I strongly recommend going to CAPS, or VPVA if it applies to you. I only mention VPVA because Dr. Vasquez specializes in EMDR, which is a form of therapy. do not know if that form of therapy would suit your particular needs, but its good to know the variety of resources on campus that are available to help you."

I still like the style - but I know I have to find something that suits me. That’s like me getting mad at my curvy friend for wearing an outfit that flatters her shape while I’m wearing the same outfit and it looks baggy even though I have the smallest size.

Paranormal,evvny1y,t1_evv25uu,1564842717.0," Candomblé, Santería and Ifá are all variants of traditional African religions. Candomblé is the Brazilian adaptation of it, from when slaves from Africa (where Orisha worship originated) tried to keep their customs and beliefs in this foreign land. Ifá is a Yoruban religion, which has adapted into Santería with slaves being transported to the caribbean, particularly Cuba. where Santería is practiced heavily. There are two variants of Santería, one being Ocha and one being Ifa. It is similar to how Christians have Baptist branches and Pentecostal branches. Differences, but similarities overall. I’m Colombian, but all of these unique religions can be practiced anywhere. South America, Africa, North America. If Ifá divination calls for it, that’s how you know you have a calling in the religion. I can only speak confidently of Ifá rules."

Whatever your beliefs may be about spirituality and the paranormal, I firmly believe that there is a side of the human experience that many do not get to experience because only certain individuals are chosen  and have the ability to see past that veil. 

I don’t practice Candomblé or Umbanda, but I practice Ifá, which involves Orisha worship as well. My Orisha is Oyá. It sounds like this woman was doing an offering to her Orisha or an offering in general. This person removing the other woman’s offerings just disrupted many things.
