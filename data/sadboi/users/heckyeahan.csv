We have very strict rules on what events candidates can and cannot go to- if any alcohol was served at that date night, then candidates could not be allowed per our international risk management. 

Candidate voting in our organization is a huge pain point that nobody enjoys. Unfortunately, dropping candidates right before initiation is a huge problem on many chapters, and one that our chapter has actively worked for years to try and avoid.

Please feel free to message me or chat with me about this! I‚Äôm pretty well versed on our rules. You should speak with your new membership educator to ask her what happened (especially if you completed all of the candidate requirements), and what your options are."
