 CDR Robert M. Ballinger killed    by dynamite explosion during an investigation of a tunnel built by    North Koreans in the southern    portion of the demilitarized    zone, Korea, 20 Nov 1974

BPD,fqzer6c,t3_glkvbv,1589765833.0,"please do not feel bad or guilty of someone using you. You are worth more than your financial wealth, the fact that you stuck by then and helped at all makes you a better person. It sounds like the person you were dealing with is an opportunist and you do not need people like that in your life. You did the right thing, feeling suicidal and stuff like that is just the Overreaction to the feelings you have and not wanting to feel them. I get that, one of the hardest parts of dealing with BPD is learning how to sit with your feelings accept them and let them pass. Don't make a permanent decision for a temporary situation. You are better than that.

I feel the same thing should apply with BPD I constantly feel like I'm watching stuff happen from another perspective (disassociation) and then have to do damage control after the fact. MANY people do not understand, and many relationships are impossible because of it. All you can do is keep on going, embarrassed or not, try to realize everyone has their moments, ours may just be more melodramatic or frequent than most. You are not abnormal you are just like the rest of us."

My husband uses the word ridiculous all the time and it is one of my triggers, it feels like he is saying it is worse than dumb. silly doesn't even feel as offensive to me as ridiculous does. I told my husband that every time he calls me, my thoughts, ideas, opinions, wishes, dreams, hopes ridiculous I want to punch him in his face. 

Today I am really struggling to get along with my husband, his attitude is terrible, but I am sure, I am also being hypersensitive, and it is an internal war to keep my mouth shut and try to work through the problems and triggers instead of trying to talk to him, and ending up in a fight because I am clearly off.

you might want to try something to distract you from picking, I know easier said than done, like coloring, or knitting or something else where you work with your fingers. I know it's not the same, but it is a more healthy choice. the scars up and down my arms are embarrassing, and the threat of skin infection can be real. I took Citalopram for several years to quell some of the picking, eventually, it stopped working.

AmItheAsshole,fd6afv7,t1_fd686qc,1578187985.0,"Thank you for your interest,  one of my therapists asked me how I felt scamming people. I never claimed to be otherworldly, the tarot cards each have an assigned meaning, in an assigned place, and each deck you buy comes with the directions.  I considered myself more of a personal counselor.  People called because they felt down about something and needed someone to work their feelings out with. 
I explained it was for entertainment only, nothing is set in stone, every thought and action can change your overall outcome.... blah blah..
Those who were near death wanted to know where they were going. I would refer them back to their own faith and how they felt and why they felt that way. 99% of the time they left the call feeling more confident in themselves and their situations. 
When people called for lost or stolen jewelry I helped them retrace their steps till they found it, or gave them ideas on where to look. Usually easy finds.
I once spoke to a murderer/cannibal who I started my spiel with, he said cut the shit. Said my name wasnt Amethyst, refused to accept it, so I told him after a good 10 minutes of proclaiming it being my real name, I said ""fine, its courtney"" as in courtney love (I was a fan, obviously by my screenname) he accepted that. Said he didn't want to have a tarot reading he just knew he was going away for life and wanted to run up his credit card bill confessing to someone other than the cops. So I proceeded to listen to him for over an hour. Come to find out, he wasnt lying, except he only got 1 1/2 years... his co-conspirator got life..
Off topic. Anyways no, I did not feel inward scamming people. I never claimed I spoke to the dead or give them false hope, I read the cards, listened to their problems and tried to help them find reasonable solutions. Phew. Anyways when i got the job my dad called a line and wasted over $100. I said ""dad, did she tell you anything you didn't already know?"" He admitted it was all generalizations and more of a pal to talk to..
If I'm asked to ""do a reading"" I show the person how I do it, and where to read the directions, what to remember. (The deck I had for the phone job literally had the meanings written right on the card. The rider-whaite(sp?) Starter deck.) I made $6.50 /ph at office or $0.10 a minute independently.  They paid $19.99 a minute to the company I worked for.
