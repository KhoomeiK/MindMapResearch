I found reading a book last night helped me but I also took a benzo ☹️ I don't want to get addicted to something my Dr told me to take a few times a week only.

AusSkincare,fkk05sf,t1_fkjwe97,1584267803.0,"> But I would argue that they are not on your skin for enough time to have any real effect.

I agree. I do not buy cleansers or scrubs with acids in them for this reason. Would much rather use a leave-on product."
SkincareAddiction,fk9ik8s,t3_fgxf66,1583976779.0,"Great post. I had oily but clear skin in my teens then I had cystic acne from about 20 years old. Guys, I'm 45 going on 46 now and inexplicably, my acne has subsided. Well, not really inexplicable - it's always hormones. They shift and fluctuate throughout adulthood, not only affecting your skin but your mood and your hair among other things. 

It was super hard to get on top of the acne during the 20 plus years I had it, but I did manage it with a particular combo of birth control pill and retin a. And now, I'm finding I don't need the topical treatment now. It's so *weird* to be in a place where I'm not obsessing over my acne. I'm finally getting the best skin of my life... except now I have age-related skin problems to focus on LOL. It never ends."

Anxiety,fjbw6r5,t1_fjbl5s9,1583202771.0,I had my first one at work recently too and I was embarrassed. I just wanted to hide. In the end I went home early. The drive home was actually very calming
Anxiety,fj61fwd,t3_fbq6n2,1583052012.0,Yes I relate to this. I’m very much an introvert. But I am wondering if you may have depression too. Maybe you should make a Dr appointment.

AusSkincare,fi69ud0,t1_fi69kjf,1582184621.0,"I feel the same way about Accutane... could've gone on it. Never wanted to because of potential side effects. 

I've tried Tret and Azelaic acid. The Tret helped when the pill alone wasn't doing enough. Azelaic acid (Finacea) did not help my cystic acne at all. It may be enough for milder acne. The good part about Finacea is it's relatively easy to get - it's over the counter, although some chemists may need to order it for you."
CrossStitch,fi69nas,t3_f6oij6,1582184380.0,Aww bless. Hope she feels better soon so she can get back to her duties!

AusSkincare,fi65rlk,t3_f68f78,1582179962.0,I do think the pill could help you a lot with your skin. It's also a great bonus to have more control over your menstrual cycle. I really think you should consider it. Of course you need to discuss it with your Dr. It is definitely not for everyone but helps many women - myself included. I've been on it in one form or another since I was 23-ish? I'm 45 now and I asked my GP recently if I should stay on it and she says she likes me on it for the estrogen. I've no history of blood clots so I stick with it.
AusSkincare,fi64eaj,t3_f6gqnu,1582178622.0,"Have you tried a dermatologist yet? I have suffered acne myself and getting a professional involved is the way to go. Start with a chat with a GP. Some have an interest in patient dermatology/acne themselves - you might get lucky. Others will send you to a derm. 

For me personally, being on the pill (Estelle) and using Retrieve (tretinoin) helped the most. Lately though, I think my hormones must be shifting and I am finding the pill to be enough on its own. I'm not breaking out nearly as much as before. I'm 45."
