merlinbbc,fqa83jn,t1_fq9pf9g,1589214490.0,"you've literally put the words in my mouth. the ooc part makes so much sense. I mean I do get that liking someone brings out a different side of you but Arthur's different side so far is almost laughable.

anyways. I'm just really glad people replied to my post haha"
merlinbbc,fqa7ril,t1_fq6cvyi,1589214320.0,"I agree with most of this but I'm mostly upset at how badly written their story was. it's like the writers knew that the relationship was inevitable so they'd just it be. I was hoping for something interesting especially because Gwen was introduced as a servant to us. if they'd built it up a little more before the whole kiss scene it would've still been better. actually any sort of build up would've made it better. and I definitely don't agree with the last bit. I think chemistry is very important for a relationship, on screen anyway, especially if it's a love-match. I understand getting our fix with Arthur and Merlin but Arthur and Gwen is such a historical pairing. 

I still have to watch more though. I'm so glad I can talk about the show with people. none of my friends have watched it, most haven't even heard about it."
merlinbbc,fq5vc6c,t1_fq5v0rf,1589118386.0,:(( well that's unfortunate
merlinbbc,fq5uirv,t1_fq4et3w,1589117802.0,"Exactly!!! they should've gone about Arthur-Gwen a lil nicer, especially since we all know it's inevitable. but maybe that's why they didn't put effort?"
merlinbbc,fq58d58,t1_fq4xjvy,1589095929.0,"from what I've seen so far (which isn't much), I think they'd have a really good friendship. i feel like they should've worked on that first and then jumped the kiss scene on us."

NoStupidQuestions,f86zxne,t1_f86zqm3,1574311428.0,This would've been great if I were living alone. Alarms wake my roommate up before it wakes me up and we have very different schedules.

NoStupidQuestions,f86yso0,t1_f86yeif,1574310462.0,That sounds like a really good idea. But I'll have to wait quite a while to save up for one. The ones in my country are a bit more than I can afford rn (I'm a student). Thanks so much anyway!
