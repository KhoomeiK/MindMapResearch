Dr: Well...

Me a year later: oh okay, I see the problem I was ignorant based on media reports of autism and also I heard the word Autism and heard mentally retarded, which I am far from but now I understand it's a spectrum and recognise.

Moral of the story.
Shout at people when they speak an untruth, or are vague about anything and encourage them gently to be more specific and stop causing trouble with bias, projection and down right ignorance... Even if it's not about Autism Spectrum.

(Y'all think I'm kidding).

I wrestled with it for a few years. After all I was a charming bastard. I did however learn consciously how to be charming years before my diagnosis.

Now I don't give a fuck.
It's just a bunch of behaviours not symptoms, and I use them to my advantage.

Denial is strong in all of us no matter how smart we are.

adultautism,fmxrq4e,t1_fmxj118,1586470583.0,"Oof. In regards to the screeching, I can only say based on my experience of online gaming, it's one thing for kids to not hit puberty (in regards to boys) and be kinda high pitched, but literal screeching? That's unacceptable behaviour. That's something you could look at as a parent. Encourage them to talk about their feelings ""use words"" as they say. Or draw their feelings if they're inclined towards art.
Hell, distract them is a ""cheap"" tactic, but it does work and one I'm sure you probably know about.

Again, personal experience, I know as an avid in ear headphone user, that the more I wear such, the MORE sensitive ones hearing becomes!

We're human beings it's about adaption or tolerance. Maybe you could wear them less in conjunction with talking to and encouraging your kids to express themselves verbally/creatively and in a more calm fashion.
I don't know how affected your kid is, but physical movement, like dancing is a big help, shifts focus, burns off energy, win-win.

No rudeness on telling you how to parent or anything, but if it's literal screeching, it needs to stop man, and not just for you but for them and your partner as well. It's stressful for everyone!

You don't need to tell me about the anger issues or the outbursts, lol, I will remind you though, try not to beat yourself up about it and just try to resolve the sound issue like I mention above.

Do you have downtime? (Whats downtime I hear every parent reading this, shout at me lol).

Timeout, time to self, is as important if not more for those of us on the spectrum as it is for others. I'd be hard pressed not to say, as guys we do struggle with that, so if that's you too, make a time allotment, a space, ya know, just for you. Maybe take it in turns with your partner even if you don't already do that.

I'm constantly stressed, and it's it not just auditory. Some things I don't even recognise but I know it affects me.

So uhm yeah, thars my advice on those things.

I did write a long ass post to your previous comment it's a bit much though so I'll refrain from posting lol.

I will say from that though, communication is key, I don't know how much or well you express your feelings with your partner, but for most of us men, it's difficult, but it is something we can learn to do and be a better man for it.
A lot less stressed as well. 

Don't worry about not being believed. I've been through it myself and pretty much all of us have! A life of constantly being misunderstood has its affect! Just be honest, that's all you can really do. Tripping over Yourself trying to communicate to someone (a mental health professional in this case) sadly only complicates things and makes them more difficult for you and them.

Try not to beat yourself up about things, its difficult, I know.

Goodluck with getting a diagnosis, I hope it helps relieve some weight on your shoulders and makes your life a little easier, especially with your boss!

Final note, for me, I've always focused on possibilities, the good and bad, I think you couldn't go wrong with putting your hyper sensitivity with sound to use. Say music, maybe even voice acting!
Ya know if you own a problem and use it to your advantage it becomes less and less a problem. I don't really see all my issues as well issues, I see them as opportunities that most others don't have!

Is an official diagnosis something you feel you NEED?
Is it really what you need? Or is it something that others in your environment, family, work colleagues, ""need""?

I'll say to you dude, as I do anyone else wanting a Diagnosis, 
A diagnosis isn't anywhere near as important as being able to express yourself, including any difficulties!

Now you mention you're a big black dude, why can't you say, yes I'm a big black dude that has feelings and i struggle with some shit?

There's nothing wrong with that.

If you feel you need a diagnosis to as you say ""catch up""
Dude come on, being real! Look at your perspective! 

A diagnosis won't change a thing and if anything will only add more barriers and things you have to deal with.

This isn't a popular opinion as many feel a diagnosis is necessary, but it's really fucking not!

You clearly understand wtf is going on, you just need to express that in a non aggressive form, that's before you flip.

But seriously though, it's heartbreaking seeing people, others just take MBTI as an end all and it becomes their life. It's just the beginning and it brings me joy to see someone else get it!

As far as I'm concerned, MBTI is a tool of many and a popular window into, dare I say, mine, yours everyone else's soul."

Thank you for sharing your expertise!

Yeah, I watch way too many movies. It does help me with art for sure and even creative writing but not so much on specialised knowledge (even if the movie is focusing on a specific area).

Neo dodging bullets though, that was totally legit, right? Lol."
VoiceActing,fi9v0wt,t3_f6jw6w,1582283580.0,"Warm ups, not really.

Techniques? Yes. Check out Michael Trimble on YouTube, Retired Opera singer and accidental entertainer, go through his breathing videos. Might

It is possible to fix and something I've improved on, but not comfortable enough to give instructions about.

I suppose one thing you could TRY
is getting a few strips of tissue paper, placing over your head, so it falls over your face and past your chin and try to speak without moving it.

Learning to breath properly is incredible important for everything, so maybe you can focus on how to breath properly instead of trying to solve a bad habit as you like many of us, have more than one."

I'm sure Captain Jack Sparrow impression would go down well.

I mean, are you looking to impress and entertain or really try and be specific and true? That's a lot of homework, a LOT.
I doubt the latter would be able to be appreciated tbh.

Whenever I goof around, I just say arggggh and shiver me timbers. Lol. A lot of r's.

It's a complex answer. Do you know where the pirates are from, region? I'm Probably over thinking for a school production.

Who is your character? Lowly Deckhand? Eagle nest spotter? Captain?

I recommend you just check out a lot of pirate movies.
You could do the spongebob intro voice though?

Or hell make it something new, your own, just add argghh and stuff in there.

Pirates seem like a very dramatic character to play, id focus on body language as well.

Again though, maybe too much lol."

Fasting does work, but it is another way to develop possible eating disorders.

I fast for health, personally.

Just be mindful is all want to remind everyone. This isn't some get thin quick scheme.

Maybe this doesn't apply to you though, but for those that may stumble accross... especially the young and naive peeps."
