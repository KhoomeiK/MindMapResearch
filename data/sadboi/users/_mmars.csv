Anxiety,fp7sp1p,t3_gbnjuv,1588376989.0,"Yes but my anxiety is being stuck at home and not seeing any family. My husband is still working and my sister moved in with us during this time and is working and I am home alone with nothing but my own thoughts, I watched tv, cleaned up, organized and decorated around the house but now that I have been home out of work for a month and a half I have so much anxiety without my routine of work, that I actually have been loosing my appetite and making myself sick. I have had to force myself to eat and take vitamins I may be low in but I just want this to be over."
