\-the squad and Maxine Waters for \*leading\* the call for impeachment

\-Pelosi, once she decided to impeach, for making a strong case that Trump is endangering the very existence of the republic (she's right too!)

\-Adam Schiff, who is the subject of a lot of anti-semitic conspiracy theories right now and is forging ahead

\-Ted Lieu, Asian American LA congressman who is part of the judiciary committee and an early vote for impeachment
