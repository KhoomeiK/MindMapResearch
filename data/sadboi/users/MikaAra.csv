DPR 76 confirmed cases, two deaths.
LPR 70 confirmed cases. One death of a covid positive person, which, according to the authorities, was definitely not from a coronavirus, person was asymptomatic. This death was not included in the statistics.

Persistent rumors about the beginning of full quarantine in both republics starting around May 1, but no decision has been made yet.

Separately, about the events. Oktoberfest has been canceled."
u_Abel_A_Kay,fojm7ql,t1_fofobgm,1587824456.0,"My rather naive forecast.

The number of newly confirmed cases in April reached a plateau in the region of 90,000 new cases per day. In May there will probably be a slow decrease in the incidence rate in Europe, America and Canada, and some other countries where everything is normal with quarantine. This will be offset by an increase in the incidence rate primarily in Russia, and then in Turkey, Brazil, Peru, Mexico, India, Belarus, and later in Africa. Together, it will probably come out a bit worse than April, so there will probably be about 4-5 million new cases in May, and in all somewhere around 8 million by the first of June. Do not judge me strongly for such a forecast, maybe there will be more,up to ten million.

Closer to the end of May, and most likely  in June the second waves will start, but it’s still very difficult to say how big they will be, I hope that they will be less significant than the first wave, but how less significant will depend on too many factors."

Direct language: ""The Ministry of Infrastructure shall, from 12 noon on March 18, 2020, prohibit railway air and bus intercity and interregional passenger transportation. Prohibit the operation of subways.

Urban transportation can be carried out in the mode of ""up to 10 people"" in minibuses and taxis. And up to 20 people in trolleybuses / buses / trams. ""

Prehistory:

Today, according to the results of the Virological Reference Laboratory Research Center of the Center for Public Health in Ukraine, 5 positive results were obtained in COVID-19: Chernivtsi (4) and Zhytomyr (1, fatal cases) of the region.

Reliable source

At a meeting with the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Mikhail Mishustin, among other measures, the possibility of extending the high-alert mode to the whole country was discussed, RBC writes with reference to sources.

The interlocutors of the publication emphasized that many other scenarios were examined as to how to act in a situation of a coronavirus pandemic. No decisions have been made yet, emphasized one of the sources of RBC. Another source said that ""decisions will be made and announced on Monday.""

The government’s website reports that Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin instructed First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov and Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova to report on March 16 on proposals for ensuring economic development in connection with the spread of coronavirus.

The high alert mode was previously announced by Moscow, Moscow Region, Leningrad Region, St. Petersburg and a number of other subjects of the Federation, for example, Penza Region. In the framework of the high-readiness regime, in particular, restrictions are imposed on mass events with the number of participants exceeding the threshold determined by local authorities (each region sets its own), and it is recommended that citizens returning due to countries unfavorable in terms of the spread of coronavirus be in two weeks self-isolation."

I had to return to my old place two years ago. Almost all of my friends from this place are from before internet era, I lost connection with more of them , moreover most of them moved out,  and I am not sure if coming out to them will make friends sense . 
This place is definitely more conservative than Kentucky,  what with recent developments, most young people moved out of this place, and most population of this town now is elderly. Because of  disability which complicates my access to computer,  I am not making new friends here at all, there are almost no open local transgenders here anyway. here goes my wish to go out in skirt  outside of cosplay events, it is plain not safe here, I am not even sure about my usual unisex/female casual attire I used to wear at my previous metropolitan city I lived in. Transphobia at home is sickening, religious cult is toxic,  although I am left to my devices at least some part of the time, it is definitely not a place where I can easily feel like my gender.."
