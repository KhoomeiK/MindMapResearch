A personal anecdote about Joe:  He introduced me to the Internet. It was 1992 and I was hanging out in the weather lab waiting for the next morning cut-in. He was explaining how computers were now interconnected using something called ""the world wide web."" Then he proclaimed whatever you wanted to know or see was now on it. I was like, ""no way!"" And he said, ""WAY!""  Then he asked me to test it by throwing out something I didn't think would be on it and I was, ""Ok, show me something about ant farms.""  I don't know why I thought of that, but I was trying to think of something totally random.

ANYway, he did some tap-tap-tapping on the computer keyboard and before you know it, up popped a website devoted to ant farms. I remember distinctly saying, ""Holy shit Joe! This is going to change the world."" And Joe, being the prophet of technology he is said, ""Yes. It will."""

cedarrapids,fqrd8yb,t1_fqrajd1,1589582086.0,"You are wrong. Infection fatality rate (IFR) in Iowa is hovering around 1.4%. Nationally we are at 1.3% - 1.8% depending on whether you are looking at CDC numbers or the recent research published here: [https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00455](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00455)

Either way, this is WAY higher than the seasonal flu, which is something like .2 to .3%. 

Oh - and if you are going to say ""but a lot of those fatalities were not COVID-19 but pneumonia"" remember pneumonia is often \*caused\* by a SARS-2 infection. So without one, you wouldn't have the other.  

What is more disturbing about COVID-19 is the hospitalization rate. Around 20% of those infected require some degree of hospitalization.  Much higher than other viruses like seasonal influenza. If infection rates continue to rise, hospital resources will be exhausted, then those who aren't able to get the healthcare resources they need will die, leading to an increase in the fatality rate.

This is what happened in China, Italy and now India, and this is where the IFR climbed to around 4%. So while our IFR's are lower here in the U.S., there is nothing to prevent them from climbing upwards in short order if we don't practice shelter-in-place and social distancing.

So you see your whole ""it's no worse than anything else"" argument is horseshit. And don't take my word for it. Here's a data visualization from the CDC that should give you pause: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/images/us-mortality-graph-may72020.jpg](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/images/us-mortality-graph-may72020.jpg)"
