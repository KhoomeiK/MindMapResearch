The fact that you even have to expand on it being something you worked for and is expensive is already suspect.

There is no such thing as a neutral bias. When celebrities, front page news, advertisements, etc. all try to point you in one direction and then questioning, not necessarily disagreeing, with the narrative gets you automatically labeled a conspiracy theorist, what does that suggest?

Take a look sometime at the actual donors behind politicians. Look at where Google Inc, 20th Century Fox, Apple Inc, Facebook Inc, WarnerMedia Group, Walt Disney Co., etc. spend their money. What candidates do they spend most money on? That speaks pretty descriptively about bias. Why do politicians have casting companies from LA as top donors?

While you think in the small-scale about Democrat versus Republican, insanely wealthy and corrupt people profit from the mindless shit slinging between parties when in reality there is no actual choice at all. That’s why they’re so pissed Trump won. He’s not in their group, and he wasn’t supposed to win their rigged game. The last election was supposed to be Clinton versus Bush. A fake choice between two people on the same team, like many elections before it. McCain versus Obama, Obama versus Romney, Gore versus Bush - notice how despite their different “public” political party they’re all treated quite nicely by the majority of media?

Then if people try to make alternative media they’re shut down by YouTube, Google, Facebook, Patreon, PayPal, GoDaddy, etc. Reddit and their Tencent overlords couldn’t even tolerate a subreddit that supported the sitting President.

How many people still believe Trump said white supremacists are good people regarding Charlottesville? Every last major news network, nearly every last one of those in the “middle” of this graph, parroted that for months when the full transcript of what he said easily debunks that.

> And as I have said many times before, no matter the color of our skin, we all live under the same laws. We all salute the same great flag, and we are all made by the same almighty God.

> We must love each other, show affection for each other and unite together in condemnation of hatred, bigotry and violence. We must rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty, that bring us together as Americans.

> Racism is evil. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the K.K.K., neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.

> We are a nation founded on the truth that all of us are created equal. We are equal in the eyes of our creator. We are equal under the law. And we are equal under our Constitution.

> Those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike at the very core of America. Two days ago, a young American woman, Heather Heyer, was tragically killed. Her death fills us with grief and we send her family our thoughts, our prayers and our love.

> I’ve condemned neo-Nazis. I’ve condemned many different groups. But not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch. Those people were also there because they wanted to protest the taking down of a statue, Robert E. Lee.

> So — excuse me — and you take a look at some of the groups and you see and you would know it if you were honest reporters, which in many cases, you are not. But, many of those people were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee. So this week, it is Robert E. Lee. I noticed that Stonewall Jackson is coming down. I wonder, is it George Washington next week? And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?

Or people who distrust Hillary Clinton for corrupt, criminal practices while Secretary of State.

You overlook people who are tired of pandering politicians who use flowery, empty language to sound good for their campaigns only to do nothing while elected. This is turned around to somehow indicate that people who would rather hear a straight talker who follows through must only appeal to non-academic retarded deplorable scum of society. That’s how you talk about people who disagree with you without hesitation. You automatically assume there is no logical perspective that could possibly lead to being conservative or non-leftist. 

There’s a lot of people who never open their mouth about their political opinions. There are millions of people who support Trump for actual policies based on what he actually campaigned on, not what mainstream shit tried to sensationalize. Economy, manufacturing, jobs, infrastructure, getting out of unnecessary war, preservation of personal liberty, getting out of wealth redistribution schemes abroad, trade, destroying ISIS, etc. He’s a billionaire who can’t be bought off or shut up with money; that alone makes him a massive threat to the political establishment. Which he further demonstrated at the Al Smith charity dinner.

There’s more than black and white shit you hear from media that profits from sensationalism and lies. I’m not being combative or argumentative or anything else, just giving a different perspective than the hackneyed and ironic position of “everyone who doesn’t agree with me is a stupid bigot”. 

Democrats are in the same position as they were last election cycle: bad candidates and the only platform is anti-Trump. No discourse regarding actual ideas, just fallacious campaigns that exploit emotions, anger, fear, and paranoia to cover the fact that the political establishment is in shambles because Trump was never supposed to win."

Most likely, she was using you to build a relationship where she’s with a financially stable safe bet with a semi-responsible guy while she has fun on the side and in secret with guys that actually turn her on. It’s a brutal pill to swallow. But you have to learn eventually those people exist. 

It’s normal to feel betrayed, angry, and hurt; grieve the loss of time, but be grateful in knowing that you didn’t have marriage or children thrown into the mix. Be thankful she didn’t waste another day. You’re in your prime and it sucks to feel used, but her best punishment is that she is who she is. A manipulative, lying loser who will probably try to do anything to rope you back in. Do not fall for it. At her core she is a rotten person who will try to use sex or lies to get you to stay, not realizing her sex and lies is why you’re leaving. You’re better than that. 

I’m a woman, but if I were in your shoes I would take her to a fancy dinner as if you don’t know. Watch her lie and pretend in real time and soak in exactly who she is as a person. At some point, preferably after you’re sated from a good meal and properly disgusted with the person in front of you, excuse yourself to the restroom and just leave. Send a text telling her to not contact you again and suggest her mom’s favorite tinder boy pick her up and foot the bill. If she has stuff at your place, throw it in the yard and tell her it’ll be there for 24 hours and if it’s not gone by then you’re taking it to a dumpster. 

Get angry inside, be collected on the outside, and stand up for yourself. At least give her the opportunity to embarrassed of herself so she can come face to face with the trash she is. But chances are she still won’t take it."

Embracing knowledge gained outside the classroom is a form of emotional revenge against academic ""elites"" who have scorned them

This is not a uniquely right-wing belief, and I knew from the moment you started trying to paint too much detail into a single caricature of a “stupid” person that it was going to be a petty attempt at generalizing your own political adversaries.

You’re being disingenuous about why a common person might be inclined to be against elite career politicians or global elite who have extended, oftentimes illicit, powers and behaviors behind closed doors beyond their perceived public role and scope. People who dislike those who continue to influence policies, government, etc. even if they were never elected or have since left office. Elite in the context of politics is different than your professors; beyond that, it’s always a good thing to be able to critically think and be able to engage in debate with those who are teaching you. 

This entire spiel tries to be an objective review of “enlightened genius human” versus “lowly emotional animal”. In reality, it’s run of the mill shoddily crafted sophistry that tries to convince other people there are not logical reasons why someone holds conservative/non-leftist viewpoints. Trying to lump it in with flat-earthers not because of actual similarities, but because of your own inability to understand why someone else might have a different perspective. Perhaps you want to believe that conservatives all have a void to fill and that there couldn’t be more to the story not because it’s accurate, but because it’s easier on your ego to make assumptions and go along with the hivemind that, everywhere you go, reinforces you as good and them as bad.

Do some people have insecurities that influence a rebellious stage? Sure. But that isn’t limited to certain points of view or behaviors. I’m sure you’ll mention some vehement feminists who publicly hate “cis men” who mostly just have daddy issues or those who make their sex life/mental illness their entire identity rather than just a piece of who they are. Are those people feigning intellectual beliefs in an attempt to cover for emotional trauma or needs? Or did you just want to try to frame it in a one-sided way for a personal reason?

Your whole thing is premised on those who reject authority, but unsurprisingly, and ironically, you omitted that the same goes for those who adamantly appeal to authority in place of ever thinking for themselves. Those who prioritize a false sense of belonging over even the chance that they might be rejected socially. It goes both ways. It happens to people of all belief systems.

AskReddit,fa09wtk,t1_fa03y20,1575751330.0,"Just to be clear, in your initial comment you said:

> Sex is something that is seen as mandatory in our society, and most people, especially women, who actually don't like it, don't even realize not having it is an option until far too late. She was having sex with you the whole time because she felt she had to. Maybe for a long time she was afraid to say anything, and quietly suffered through it. Does that make you happy? Do you want your wife to feel that way? She finally felt she could trust you with the truth and you're shitting on her for it.

I never stated that pressure to have sex doesn’t exist, I disagreed with a few things.

1. The fact that it’s mandatory. Plenty of people don’t feel pressured and naturally won’t speak about it. Not everyone discusses their sex lives.

2. The fact that you said most women don’t know there’s an option to not have sex until it’s too late. Most women are very clear on the fact that they don’t have to have sex until they are ready and with a person they feel comfortable with. And that is compounded by the fact that it’s likewise very socially recognized that anyone who pressures you into something you don’t want to do, sexual or otherwise, is a toxic person you should avoid or cut ties with. 

3. The fact that you tried to insinuate he selfishly made his wife unhappy or suffer when, if she at any point felt like she is actually asexual, she should have communicated that. Instead she one-sidedly decided something for him instead of opening up conversation about her feelings and her experiences with sex so they could find a solution as a team. 

> So now, imagine you're a person like me, who hated it those first few times, and now you're in a relationship where you've set the precedent of sex, and the other party expects it to happen. 

That’s where you step in and say you need to have a serious conversation about how you’ve been feeling when having sex. And if you feel like you can’t have that conversation because they wouldn’t listen or respect your concerns, they’re not someone you should be having sex with.

> And it doesn't get better over time like you think it must. Maybe it's incredibly painful, maybe the whole thing makes you uncomfortable, maybe you just find it totally not fun at all. 

Some of those things warrant a doctor visit, other things warrant, again, communicating with your partner and gauging your next steps in your relationship on their reactions to your concerns.

> Yes, you can certainly say no, or stop it before it happens, but after a while, they're gonna suspect something's up when you only ever say no. So you do it every now and then because you feel like you're supposed to.

But something *is* up, and you’re not telling them. They have the right to know what’s going on just as much as you do. Most people who need sex in a relationship would much rather learn that their partner isn’t enjoying it for whatever reason and break things off cleanly than learn their partner was intentionally forcing something just to appease the other person. It tells the other person you don’t want to speak up for yourself or that you don’t feel comfortable doing so. Both are red flags.

> It feels to me, implying that even if you hate and dread having sex, you should just do it if your partner's perspective is reasonable?

No. It means if sex is not important to you and you know it’s important to your partner, you should not continue to force yourself having sex with them and lead them on thinking that it’s something you also desire. It will lead to resentment on both sides. Just like forcing yourself to have sex with someone is unfair to you, pretending to like it in the hopes of pleasing someone who enjoys sex is unfair to them. You both should be with someone who matches your actual preferences.

Everyone has dealbreakers and if someone needs sex, it’s not ‘aphobic’ or problematic for someone to break it off because they need that. Men often look for a soft place to come home to. A place where they can be vulnerable, feel loved, appreciated, and supported. For many that’s being intimate and having sex. Doesn’t mean that’s all the woman is for, but it’s the woman he feels safe with and chose to marry that he feels most comfortable doing that with. And that’s what is hard to swallow when they’re told “hey, no more sex”. It takes away more than just sex.

Saying “you should be able to love someone without sex” is great in theory, but for some people it’s more important because it’s just how they feel most connected to their partner. If that isn’t you, they shouldn’t force you. But it also means that those who are otherwise uninterested in sex should not act as though the person wanting sex is inherently wrong. Both parties should be able to clearly communicate their desires, values, etc. and from there that is how you determine whether or not they are someone you want to be with in the long-term."
AskReddit,f9zzk0g,t1_f9zwsp3,1575747008.0,"I am a woman and yes it’s reinforced vigorously throughout our lives that we have the option to say no for any reason. If you’re in a relationship that disregards that ability, it’s socially seen as a toxic, manipulative, and abusive in the US. 

The comment about her “duty” as a wife doesn’t mean her worth is in her ability to put out, but saying “I don’t like sex, we aren’t having it anymore” to someone they married without communicating, counseling, or otherwise considering another perspective is not indicative of an emotionally mature person in a relationship. Marriage or otherwise.

People who marry for stability and end up cheating with someone they feel ‘sparks’ with later on are much more common than women who don’t like sex. And it’s not aphobic to point that out.

A number of things affect libido besides age. Diet, medications, antidepressants, exercise, stress, etc. For the average person who has gone through puberty, not being sexually interested is regarded as a medical symptom often caused by their lifestyle/choices not a hardwired facet of their personality.

Immediate divorce in this situation is as irrational as one party declaring that a part of their marriage will categorically no longer take place and assuming there won’t be consequences. Dead bedrooms mostly lead to loneliness and resentment, as do those who don’t communicate well. It’s up to each individual to decide how much of each they can tolerate."
AskReddit,f9zuvaq,t1_f9zka7d,1575745630.0,"Saying she’s lying or misleading him is just as much of an assumption as the possibility of her being asexual. 

Sorry to say that an extremely common pattern is people getting married, having kids, years go by, and then they realize how bored/stagnant their love lives are when they meet someone at work, gym, etc. who attracts them.  

Not all, but many end up cheating either emotionally, physically, or both. Then they blame the person they cheated on for not doing enough even though the cheater chose the short-term ego boost/fun of a fling rather than legitimately communicating with someone they supposedly chose to be a long-term partner. 

Then people like you take it one step farther and say men/society at large are at fault because women don’t know they “don’t have the option to have sex”? Are you joking? Everyone knows they don’t have to have sex and socially they’re urged not to for a variety of reasons until they’re in a committed relationship with someone with whom they feel safe and respected by. You’re trying to guilt trip someone into thinking their wife has only potentially either suffered through or had pity sex with him their entire relationship and you *honestly* believe that is the most likely option for her statement? 

People marry someone they see a future with and can 
trust, not the hottest person they’ve ever seen who is unpredictable. Sometimes looks/personality overlap, but a lot of people learn the hard way that tolerating a toxic relationship with someone because of their looks isn’t the right move. So you learn that you can be attracted to someone for more than looks alone, and that is what makes a more wholesome relationship. Looks fade. People change. And so some people are weak when they get the feeling of when they were young and excited even though they’re in a committed relation and they end up hurting a lot of people in the process.

Stop assigning people as bigots or afraid of asexuality when it mimics a story many have either known or lived through themselves. Not to mention loss of libido and other sexual problems/dysfunction in general is often a symptom of something else it’s not just a sexual orientation."

Neither of which are representative of average people.

There are extremely benevolent, talented, and bright people who are conservatives. Just like the same is true for liberals. A lot are everyday people that never make the news. People who benefit you without you even knowing or meeting them.

Beyond that it’s dehumanizing others unlike you for the sake of feeling falsely content with your own beliefs. If you can’t debate those with whom you disagree, your point is probably shit. That’s a mark of *actual* immaturity. Which again, is not a political thing it’s a people thing. There are people of all demographics and belief systems who are immature and unintelligent.

There’s a difference in my mind between those who feel helpless but would still accept help at some point versus those who are confident in the idea that there is nothing wrong with their choices. The former is dangerous, but the latter is the real death sentence. 

Sometimes people need to hit rock bottom before they realize how short and how fragile life really is.

Regarding ignoring the pain, though, another major contributor is alcohol consumption. A lot of people try to drink to numb emotional pain that’s, in their mind, more pressing than physical discomfort.

If you are mentally healthy and physically healthy, sometimes it may not be clear why someone would choose to shortsightedly and unhealthily cope with mental/emotional pain and put their physical health in jeopardy.

I went to Sam’s club looking for an air fryer to try it out since I was tired of smoke and grease everywhere, but saw that one on the shelf and saw it also had a pressure cooker, dehydrate, sear, etc. function plus it was on sale for the holidays so thought why not. 

Since then I’ve used it every day. I make stocks 1-2x/week and that alone is such an improvement from having something in a slow cooker/pot simmering all day and the cleanup from all of that. I do mine for 1.5 hours and everything looks as if it’s been in there simmering for 48. So easy to throw in burgers, wings, steak. chicken, or sausage for a quick meal. Can do a ton of hard/soft-boiled eggs at a time to keep in the fridge. Most tough meats are tender by 45 minutes in the pressure cooker and you can sear directly in the pot before doing so. I’ve made beef jerky a few times, but they sell a rack attachment for that so you can get more in. Haven’t gotten that, though. 

Being completely upfront about 7 months in I did have an issue with the pressure cooker lid where it would latch but the unit didn’t register it being so. Called them and they replaced the entire unit; sent me an entire box with all attachments and everything else like I got it the first day with super fast shipping. So if you ever experience an issue yourself, customer service was top notch for me. 

It’s my favorite “luxury/non-essential” thing I’ve bought for my kitchen probably ever. Side note, if you have other people in your household that don’t eat low/zero carb the pressure cooker cooks dry beans (unsoaked) completely in 45 minutes.

* Asian style ribs, marinate in soy sauce, mirin, rice vinegar,  salt, black or white pepper, and minced garlic/ginger served with rice for him and something more adventurous for you
* Short rib pho/soup/ramen, add green onions, soft boiled eggs and hot oil (add red pepper flakes and minced garlic to a small bowl, heat up vegetable oil on stovetop until hot but not smoking, add oil to bowl and once stops sizzling add to soup)

mentalhealth,f5u6xkj,t3_dp8hga,1572469257.0,"This is purely presumptive and isn’t helpful to anyone. A lot of attention seeking behaviors in young people are rooted in a problematic home life. Can be from parents constantly fighting, watching parents go through divorce, being victim of abuse, or being neglected due to an drug addicted parent. The list is endless.

Kids try to cope with this in a number of ways, and one of those outlets is trying to do anything possible for positive reinforcement wherever they see it’s possible. One of those things can be likes/clicks on social media or projecting an image that seems trendy even if it doesn’t express their true thoughts in the most accurate way. 

Doesn’t mean they don’t have problems just because your experience is different or your idea of depression varies. Don’t judge others just because their behavior is cringy or seems fake. Cries for help don’t all look the same. If you want to inspire others with depression or other issues, perhaps share your experiences with how they can get proper help rather than try to assume whether or not certain people do or don’t struggle with mental illness altogether.

I gave names above of a handful of prominent scientists, most of whom have 100+ academic papers to their names. All whose work you can research if you’re genuinely interested in learning more about the debated science.

A few more mainstream links that talk about climate models and the 97% figure:

> Yet the assertion that 97% of scientists believe that climate change is a man-made, urgent problem is a fiction. The so-called consensus comes from a handful of surveys and abstract-counting exercises that have been contradicted by more reliable research [(Source)](https://www.wsj.com/articles/joseph-bast-and-roy-spencer-the-myth-of-the-climate-change-97-1401145980)

Regarding climate models:

> The temperature forecasting models trying to deal with the intractable complexities of the climate are no  better than “toys” or “Mickey Mouse mockeries” of the real world, he says. This is not actually a radical idea. The IPCC in its third report (2001) conceded (emphasis added):

> In climate research and modelling, we should recognize that we are dealing with a coupled non-linear chaotic system, and therefore that the long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible. (Chapter 14, Section 14.2.2.2. )] [(Source)](https://quadrant.org.au/opinion/doomed-planet/2019/09/a-climate-modeller-spills-the-beans/)

As stated previously, my point is not to antagonize science or scientists. My gripe is with corrupt politicians or others who seek to influence public policy and manipulate information for the purposes of fear-mongering and propaganda. 

E.g., using climate change as a way to guilt people into eating plant-based despite animal products being the most nutritious food for human consumption. Taking more tax dollars under the guise of “green initiatives” or agreements like the Paris Climate Accord which don’t actually hold any of the top polluters in the world accountable. Paying increased taxes isn’t inherently a bad thing, but it is when it goes to money laundering and corrupt schemes that enrich people who peddle constant sensationalist, emotional appeals.

Saying the world will literally end if you don’t vote for X candidate is the new “the sky is falling” on steroids. It’s scientifically ignorant, and is used to manipulate people more than it has anything to do with legitimate scientific inquiry."
relationship_advice,f22q8rr,t3_dbji0s,1569894392.0,"The only way to deal with your insecurities is to work on yourself and change what you don’t like. There is no magical way to make unhappiness go away. It’s there for a reason, and it’s telling you that how you’re living now isn’t what makes you feel your best. So do you want to continue ignoring that voice? Or do you want to be proactive? The choice is yours. Life is short, and it’s statistically even shorter when you actively choose to not take care of yourself.

Deep down your problem isn’t about being “the ugly one in the relationship” it’s about your own poor self-esteem and the fact that you see ugliness in yourself at all. You have to look at yourself in the mirror and really be honest with yourself about what parts of you have been neglected, ignored, or that you’ve procrastinated on. You don’t try to ignore the thoughts, you tackle them head on and make changes until you gradually develop more confidence and self-esteem. That self-fulfillment doesn’t come out of nowhere, it’s built through hard work and patience. Motivation will fade, you need to learn to discipline yourself. The days you want to eat like shit or not get out of bed the most are the days you grow the most by putting your priorities first and throwing your excuses out. 

As for your husband. Rather than be intimidated by him, choose to be inspired to be a better and healthier version of yourself. Make the choice to love and support him and when you get a nagging feeling in the back of your head about yourself, instead do something that works towards your goal. Whether that’s taking 5 minutes to drink water and meditate rather than emotional eating or other destructive habits. Little changes like that add up.

Discipline is the difference between what you want now and what you want most. If you want to be better, don’t use his success as an excuse to self-pity. Stand up, dust yourself off, take some pictures of yourself to compare as you go through your weight loss journey; then make a plan. Eat healthier and get in some exercise if you want. Diet is the most important part. Cut your addiction to sugar, limit carbohydrates, try a keto-style diet."

You want to get off to calling other people stupid because you can’t debate ideas, you just want to puff your chest out online and pretend to be a badass when you actually look the opposite. Intelligent and open-minded people aren’t condescending and angry. It just shows that the argument is about you, not the idea.

Keep ruminating over our conversation; maybe at one point it might occur to you how angry it makes you to be exposed to different opinions.

You are angry and channeling that at me; that doesn’t make your argument more valid, it just reaffirms the emotional appeals used on you and others have probably worked.  

I blame both sides equally and I see that the establishment exists on both side - it’s part of the game. Politicians pretending to hate each other in public only to work together behind closed doors. 

And when you look at climate science, there isn’t a consensus. The only people who say there is are politicians who are using that to advance policies that abuse taxpayer money and guilt trip you into thinking it’s the only morally righteous decision. It’s a vague “for the common good” appeal on steroids. All while they change absolutely nothing about their behavior. And don’t stand up to top polluters like China and India. 

The fact that this kid has gone extended periods without eating, been depressed for years, etc. and saying the root is due to the “effects of climate change” just shows she has been emotionally abused by intellectually lazy parents who should be ashamed their own political bullshit has led to unnecessary chaos and fear in their kids.

aspergers,f1gsda7,t1_f1gk7ze,1569475769.0,"Your smug and sophomoric attitude contributes nothing to your post. It was a sorry attempt at belittling those who disagree through half-witted condescension. 

Your straw-man about my opinions being founded upon demonizing the left is half of what you’ve written here and has nothing to do with the topic at hand. I’m a libertarian/centrist; I despise statism in general. I dislike any authoritarian regime or ideologies that have imposed it historically via force or those who modernly try to guilt people into forfeiting their rights, especially those under the premise of “or else the literal world will end!” The fear-mongering you endorse is a short-sighted, petulant understanding of public policy, the environment, and human behavior among other things. 

Saying “settled science” is one of the most cringe-inducing parts about people who pretend to care about science. You say that acknowledging the validity of climate change is like people saying the sky is blue without regard for a literal handful of mega-corporations owning all of US media and vast deplatforming/censorship on social media. What research gets funded is a political process.

It takes very little time to find scientists who dispute the validity of arguments claiming there is a consensus regarding anthropogenic climate change:

**Richard Lindzen** (American atmospheric physicist, author of 200+ scientific papers/books, distinguished professor of meteorology at MIT for 30 years):
> “Based on the weak argument that the current models used by the IPCC couldn't reproduce the warming from about 1978 to 1998 without some forcing, and that the only forcing that they could think of was man. Even this argument assumes that these models adequately deal with natural internal variability—that is, such naturally occurring cycles as El Niño, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, etc. Yet articles from major modeling centers acknowledged that the failure of these models to anticipate the absence of warming for the past dozen years was due to the failure of these models to account for this natural internal variability. Thus even the basis for the weak IPCC argument for anthropogenic climate change was shown to be false.” [(Source)](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703939404574567423917025400)

**Judith Curry** (American climatologist, former chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology, 140+ scientific publications, member of the National Research Council's Climate Research Committee):
> The IPCC consensus findings on attribution have been echoed in position statements made by many scientific organizations. The IPCC consensus is portrayed as nearly total among scientists with expertise and prominence in the field of climate science. The idea of a scientific consensus surrounding climate change attribution has been questioned by a number of people, including scientists and politicians. Much effort has been undertaken by those that support the IPCC consensus to discredit skeptical voices, essentially dismissing them as cranks or at best rebels, or even politically motivated ‘deniers’. 
> Students of science are taught to reject ad populam or ‘bandwagon’ appeals, a sentiment is articulated by the motto of the UK Royal Society: ‘nullius in verba’, which is roughly translated as ‘take nobody’s word for it’.  How then, and why, have climate scientists come to a scientific consensus about a very complex scientific problem that the consensus-supporting scientists themselves acknowledge has substantial and fundamental uncertainties? [(Source)](https://judithcurry.com/2012/10/28/climate-change-no-consensus-on-consensus/)

**Habibullo Abdussamatov** (Russian astrophysicist, supervisor at the ISS, head of Space research laboratory at the Saint Petersburg-based Pulkovo Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences):
 >”These parallel global warmings -- observed simultaneously on Mars and on Earth -- can only be a straightline consequence of the effect of the one same factor: a long-time change in solar irradiance. The sun's increased irradiance over the last century, not C02 emissions, is responsible for the global warming we're seeing” [(Source)](https://web.archive.org/web/20070306233723/http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/story.html?id=edae9952-3c3e-47ba-913f-7359a5c7f723&k=0)

I’m not saying the mere presence of dissent means a “consensus” isn’t viable, but that figures suggesting there is settled science of man-made climate change within acamedia is simply not the case."

The exact thing you’re trying to argue “omg people only hate her because (insert characteristic about her)” is exactly why she’s being used. Notice how no one is talking about ideas, they are talking about her. And the guy in the segment’s entire point was exactly that. Climate change is a fear-mongering emotional appeal to people to force them into shit public policy, global wealth redistribution, and taxpayer money being laundered abroad by corrupt politicians. They don’t care about the planet - they fly in their jets, spend weekends on yachts, fly across the world, eat expensive meat and fish, and waste millions of gallons of water on 50 acre mansion properties in the middle of a desert.

aspergers,f1dih0f,t1_f1c6rta,1569385280.0,"The reason people don’t take you seriously is because of historical evidence that is readily available to the public. Formerly, it was global cooling and threats of returning to another ice age, then there were articles written in the late ‘80s about how global warming will end in global catastrophe by 2000. Every decade there’s a new “the world will literally end if you don’t do [insert politically convenient action].

You think that there is scientific consensus about your opinion because that’s what you read. You think the only people who disagree with your opinion are those who binge YouTube and are conspiratorial because that’s what your sources also tell you. There is also a lot of opposing scientific literature, there are people in high-ranking positions who dissent and do so often. NASA, NOAA, and other major agencies release data that you don’t see because you are fed a narrative. 

Do you ever seek out primary sources or do you consume what’s readily available? Based on your claims, the answer is quite clear. You assume that people who publish information don’t have ulterior motives, whether views and clicks or political gain. You don’t care about money being laundered through “green” initiatives that are funded via tax dollars. You don’t care that people fear-monger to get their way into office because they can’t win via ideas. Elite people tell everyone else to stop driving to work and eat less meat while they fly on private jets non-stop and eat Japanese wagyu, caviar, and roasted bone marrow served on plates more expensive than your mortgage. You don’t care about fake public policy like the Paris Climate Accord that was supposed to “help the planet” but didn’t require anything of the top polluter in the world by leaps and bounds. China. Most people who are raging about climate change are pawns used by politicians to erode personal rights under the guise of achieving a communal good of saving the planet.

There is a reason that very young people are being targeted by this rhetoric. They have no memory of past narratives and it preys upon the idea that they have no future of action isn’t done. The same happened with wanting to restrict gun rights via David Hogg.
