wallstreetbets,fqv17f8,t1_fqv12a3,1589667827.0,It’s like normal weed flower. You can smoke it as usual or use a vaporizer. Quite a few people over at r/Vaporents do that

A year ago about to this day I took some and had what is called “ego death” and after I felt like I was truly missing something large in my life. I really started to self reflect and realized I didn’t love myself and that I hadn’t been happy in years upon years.

I just came to terms that what I was feeling is how life was. I ended up going to counseling and have been on meds since November. I’m still going through it but it’s gotten better. I also stopped drug use for the most part. 

It’s weird to say but if it wasn’t for that shroom trip I don’t think I would’ve ever gotten on meds and get the help I needed"
