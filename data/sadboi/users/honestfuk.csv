Being this humble and honest will also help you change everything you hate about yourself and others.  This is insight.  It doesn‚Äôt make you less than others to have these problems and if you read through this thread you can find many ways to start to change yourself.  Starting with getting some professional help.  

You don‚Äôt like how things are.  I wouldn‚Äôt either.  If you go get some help and start trying to change things, they WILL change.  And, you can start the process today.  This type of honesty will be paramount to that path of healing."

And, is damaging an already deranged and messed up individual going to help them rehabilitate into society?  

No.  They will get worse and do worse things to society.  They‚Äôll find other ways to get their kicks.

While we‚Äôre at it, we might as well start cutting off people‚Äôs left hand when they steal.  

It just seems a bit barbaric to me..."
JordanPeterson,ex33akx,t3_cr81o1,1565979501.0,"Maybe me.  I‚Äôm left leaning generally, but also centrist in a lot of ways...  Although, because I am naturally rebellious I like to push the left when I see them bordering on the absurd or being hypocritical.

Which, makes them assume that I must be very right leaning.  I also have a very sick sense of humour that people don‚Äôt get.  And that confuses things also.  

Like most people, my views are more complicated then can be explained by a simple partisan label.  

I take each situation and controversy/debate as its own thing, detached from its generally accepted ‚Äúpolitical alliance‚Äù."

metacanada,ex0pwqa,t3_cqwfw8,1565919283.0,"Fuck.  I almost feel bad for this guy.  I mean not really considering his pedo tendencies... He brings all the shit onto himself anyway.  No need to push for more.

He is clearly mentally ill/unstable. But if you ask me, it might be time to leave him alone.  Move on to something else... He can clearly do enough damage on his own without anyone else‚Äôs help.

I‚Äôm not exactly a beacon of mental stability myself but... It‚Äôs getting really god damn pathetic.  That‚Äôs a grown ass man...  and... just look at him.  

Yikes."
