The then-13-year-old Paige even had televised evidence to use in her defense, citing an incident featured on the show where Abby threw a chair at her. Paige said that that and similar incidents of both physical and mental abuse led to ""panic attacks and extreme anxiety.""

([https://screenrant.com/dance-mom-dark-shocking-trivia-facts/](https://screenrant.com/dance-mom-dark-shocking-trivia-facts/))

""The judge saw things differently, saying that he didn't see enough proof that Paige was actually fearful of or abused by Abby-- and in regards to the chair-throwing incident, he said that it appeared as though Abby was just throwing a chair our of anger and didn't actually throw it *at*Paige (since apparently that makes it perfectly fine).

The word **nostalgia** is learned formation of a **Greek** compound, consisting of νόστος (nóstos), **meaning** ""homecoming"", a Homeric word, and ἄλγος (álgos), **meaning** ""pain"" or ""ache"", and was coined by a 17th-century medical student to describe the anxieties displayed by Swiss mercenaries fighting away from home."
