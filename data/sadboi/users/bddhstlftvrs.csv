AskMen,fito1m5,t3_f9do3c,1582725381.0,"Yea long story short. I‚Äôm a former correctional officer. I developed mental health issues from experiences at the workplace. They have poor services available for us, you look weak if you‚Äôre the one to pull that card after something serious happens to you, and in my experience the facility I worked for was mainly unsupportive of me when I came out as having PTSD, and even a doctors note that I had was challenged by the superintendent. They ended up putting me under investigation for something that was clearly fabricated by them to hem me up. This all happened shortly after I came back from being out on worker‚Äôs compensation for four months by the way.

Basically, Three people that wrote statements concerning the incident: 1. Is proven to be lying by video recording 2. Is proven to be lying by phone recording 3. The third was also lying and she was charged with sexually exploiting an inmate last month.

The offers to return after my leave would of been even more detrimental to my mental health, so I resigned. Since leaving there I‚Äôve been able to stop drinking at least, but I changed while I was in there. A part of me definitely died and it‚Äôs not coming back."
