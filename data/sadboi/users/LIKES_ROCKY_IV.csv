Hell yes.

Or Carlisle‚Äôs. Holy shit. Running around with a vampire-hunting priest for a dad in the 1600s and eventually becoming a vampire hunter himself until a rogue vampire turned him, and then so devastated at what he‚Äôd become that he tried to starve himself to death until he couldn‚Äôt take it any more and fed on some passing deer and realised that he didn‚Äôt have to be a monster. And then working for 300 years to save people‚Äôs lives until he finally changed met a kid with the Spanish flu named Edward.

AskReddit,fqrsl2o,t1_fqrqrv3,1589591010.0,"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too bad just because you‚Äôre required to hold your learner‚Äôs permit for a year before you sit your test. We live in a big country, and a lot of people use the hours as an opportunity to take long drives. It‚Äôs especially easy for people who live out in the boonies to get their hours up quickly because often there‚Äôs little to no public transport available in their town and they can sometimes be hundreds of kilometres from the nearest biggish town. We‚Äôre also required to do 20 hours of night driving and we can‚Äôt sit our test unless we hand in our logbook and it‚Äôs been verified (each instance of driving is recorded in a line with the vehicle registration number, odometer at the beginning and end of the trip, time spent driving, driving conditions and the signature of the supervising driver, and the tester checks it for any glaringly fraudulent entries before allowing you to proceed).

I definitely don‚Äôt think 40 is enough, I think 120 is a large number but it allows new drivers to get their confidence up before they start driving unsupervised. Once they‚Äôve been granted their licence, there‚Äôs a graduated probationary period of four years total:
- one year on red P plates, where you are forbidden from using mobile phones, including hands-free, you must have a blood alcohol reading of 0 (fully licensed drivers are allowed up to 0.05), you‚Äôre not allowed to carry more than one passenger unless they‚Äôre under the age of 16 or over the age of 22, or if they‚Äôre family members, nor are you allowed to tow anything
- three years on green P plates - your passenger and towing restrictions are lifted, but you are forbidden from the above mobile use/drinking, your licence is cancelled if you rack up more than 5 demerit points (for speeding, running red lights, etc), you are not allowed to drive turbo-charged/high power V8 vehicles and unless you sat a test specifically for manual vehicles, you must only drive an automatic car until you graduate to your full licence.

I had to do the same in my test, suburban driving, highway driving, parallel parking and a three-point turn. A road sign test definitely sounds like a good idea. I think people driving poorly on busy arterial roads is a universal phenomenon, unfortunately. I can‚Äôt tell you how many people I‚Äôve seen on our freeways endangering people just by making dumb decisions. Even though our rules are so stringent, people still manage to pass even if they can‚Äôt drive for shit."

AskReddit,fpqsi1o,t3_gepq6n,1588830942.0,"I am related to [Sir Thomas Mitchell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Mitchell_(explorer)), who was the Surveyor General of New South Wales from 1828 until his death in 1855. He was integral to the surveying and exploration of Australia prior to its federation and has several roads, cities, flora and fauna named after him (most famously the [Major Mitchell‚Äôs cockatoo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_Mitchell%27s_cockatoo)).

While he is remembered as one of the most celebrated Australian explorers of his day, he was also notoriously ill-tempered and defiant. He is the last person in Australia to have ever challenged somebody to a duel (fortunately, nobody died as a result of the duel as both challengers missed their marks).

Additionally, during at least two of his expeditions he was involved in massacres of Aboriginal people:

- In 1835, an argument over the bartering of a teapot for the sexual services of an Aboriginal woman escalated into violence, and at least four of them were fatally shot (although it is speculated that the real number is much higher), including a woman who was carrying a baby on her back.
- In 1836, he felt threatened by a group of around 150 Aboriginal Australians and divided his expedition team into two groups of eight (sixteen men total, including himself). He and his men shot at the group, forcing them into the river in an effort to escape, and then fired approximately eighty rounds of ammunition at them as they attempted to swim to safety. At least eleven of the Aboriginal Australians died, although, again, this is likely an underestimation. A government inquiry was organised into the massacre but nothing ever came of it and eventually, he was given naming rights over the land where the massacre had occurred.

So suffice to say my famous ancestor was a huge fucking dick. And after all that, he died of bronchitis."

Botchedsurgeries,fpgfm5g,t1_fpfyvsx,1588601723.0,I SPREAD LA MER ON MY TOAST IN THE MORNING. I‚ÄôM CHER BITCH
melbourne,fpgfjz8,t1_fpgeeg0,1588601687.0,Yes!!! Train park! Pretty sure they stopped allowing people inside it for this reason lmao

twilight,fpg7h48,t3_gdanqi,1588596359.0,I am going to sit down and watch TV for a little while and pretend like I‚Äôm not about to throw my phone at the wall because I‚Äôm so frustrated at not being able to load the site
twilight,fpg6vkd,t3_gd385y,1588595898.0,I read the first book when it was first released before it started to gain momentum but it remember how exciting it was when the movie came out and then the additional excitement of the sequels!
twilight,fpg6q4j,t1_fpg5tj9,1588595782.0,Please post an update ASAP! I can‚Äôt load the website
melbourne,fpfzpaf,t1_fpfzm89,1588589508.0,Haha we‚Äôre a special breed. If we were lucky we could get our hands on some Cruisers. My ex-boyfriend was 18 and I was 15 when we started dating so I was the person to know because he could buy grog for my friends but most of us were too poor to buy anything better than goon
RPDRDRAMA,fpfzkqr,t1_foty8si,1588589378.0,"This!!! I got into an argument with some boomer on Facebook not about vaccines but about climate change, I asked him for proof to back up his claims that climate change wasn‚Äôt real and he turned it around on me and asked me to prove that it *was* real, and when I replied with a well thought out comment complete with a reference list he dismissed it because ‚Äúthey‚Äôre‚Äù lying to all of us and we‚Äôre ignorant sheep for believing it (he never specified who ‚Äúthey‚Äù are). There‚Äôs no arguing using logic with somebody whose beliefs are ruled by their emotions and pathological need to be right rather than relying on empirical evidence.

>Arguing with an idiot is like playing chess with a pigeon. It‚Äôll just knock over all the pieces, shit on the board, and strut about like it‚Äôs won anyway."
melbourne,fpfz4r8,t1_fpfywa2,1588588922.0,I moved to Boronia when I was 12 so missed the boat on drinking in that park (although it is Bayswater so I probably should have been) but several of my friends lost their virginity on the playground off Lewis Road half cut on Passion Pop or a big fuck off box of Fruity Lexia while everybody else ripped cones in my laundry‚Ä¶ you can take the girl out of Bayswater but you can‚Äôt take the Bayswater out of the girl
AmItheAsshole,fpfydqd,t1_fpdk14j,1588588147.0,I don‚Äôt get to see him often but I will when I can!
melbourne,fpfybeu,t1_fpfy27d,1588588079.0,"Hahaha possibly! It was down in the area between Boronia Rd and Scoresby Rd, kind of across from Lewis Road, I think it was called Ozone Road Reserve"
Botchedsurgeries,fpfx4n1,t1_fpfornq,1588586832.0,Honestly the only truly uncanny resemblance I‚Äôve seen between a celebrity and a drag performer is Chad Michaels as Cher
TellMeAFact,fpfu80u,t1_fpdy0q1,1588583685.0,I really didn‚Äôt grasp how sick this methodology was until I read about what they did to poor Rosemary Kennedy.
