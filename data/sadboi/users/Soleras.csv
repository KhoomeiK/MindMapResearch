I now believe I suffered from hyperactive anxiety attacks. Panic attacks. Look up PTSD— for me, I’ve been dealing with trauma since I was a kid. COVID-19 absolutely qualifies as traumatizing. Even if there are lingering effects of the virus, I believe PTSD is an extremely reasonable and frustrating additional outcome.

Best of luck to you."

But even then, it's the weakest two-drop in the deck and I've started cutting them. Food for thought!  


Once you start going down the Setessan Champion rabbit hole, you realize two colors is far more consistent than three for aggro, and white is the obvious pair. So for this BW deck, I wouldn't honestly consider adding green.

- Heliod does nothing without the combo.
- We can’t win if our combo gets disrupted.
- Why would I run these combo cards over cavaliers and kenrith? They’re already like a 3 card combo with fires. This deck is great because sometimes you just win, and when you don’t find fires you still play a fair game of midrange 5-drops.

I think the shell is interesting. Can you make either Heliod, Biomancer, or Glint-Horn Buccaneer useful when you don’t have the combo?"

One of our two stores put the nail in the coffin; they run Pioneer and Standard on the same night. Guess which format never fires now?

Also, I don't know if you share this experience, but I hate grinding rank on Arena. It's too time-consuming, and they don't run high-risk, high-reward events. It's lonely as fuck without chat. I \*never\* feel rewarded for spending time on Arena besides daily quests. Bums me out I put $400 into Arena because I love MTG, I have the funds no problem, and I want Arena to succeed.
