Best to stay focused on not having a 99/99 MLB party right away, considering we don‚Äôt even need that yet. Unless you want to be #1 ranked in the world, then just take your time with it. Dailies can be done quick, and only need to check the game a few times a day for shop refreshes and chocobo expeditions."
