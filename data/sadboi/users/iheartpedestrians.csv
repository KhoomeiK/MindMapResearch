*As part of the eviction measures, residential landlords are not allowed to serve a notice of unlawful detainer for default payment of rent, according to Inslee‚Äôs office.*


*Residential landlords are also barred from issuing a 20-day notice for unlawful detainer, unless the landlord provides an affidavit stating that the action is believed necessary to ensure the health and safety of the tenant or others.*"
