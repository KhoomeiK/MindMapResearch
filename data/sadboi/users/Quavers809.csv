AskReddit,fr6mifb,t1_fr6j6cg,1589928999.0,"I mean. Being fat is just a state of the body that's neither good or bad. We put in a sense of negativity on it to let people with ""better"" or ""healthy"" bodies on a higher fallacious pedestal to keep a sense of power over people. It's fucking idiotic to think that being fat is a bad thing. I'm fucking fat. I hate it when my friends say they're insecure because they're fat. I hate it was thin people say they're getting fat like it's a bad thing. Superficialities and disgusting societal vanity breeds callous apathy to everyone who fits a small portion of the criteria of who ""they"" think is superior even though they're not adonises themselves. Fuck that. Be happy with your fucking self. If not, go out on exercise if you think losing weight will make you happy‚Äînot to lose all the weight, but have a more toned body if you're not satisfied. That's what I'm doing. People care more about muscles than fat anyway. I'm keeping my fucking stomach, I'm just gonna get a better upper body and an ass. 

Just...please don't be sad about your body. Other people are shit and probably aren't happy with themselves anyway. Some people think hair is bad and it grow out of them, like? All of this is stupid."

It's a supernatural entity that contains all of what I guess is our existence within the eyes of everyone. The source is within one person. Something must be able to see our perception of reality within our reality while also having its back on the wall. It's the foundation of everything. Its host is finite, as are we. There are only 5 things that can happen after the bearer of All Sight dies, but the brunt of it all is that once it dies, everything in this life ceases to exist‚Äîat the very least this life ceases to exist to the host like how another person you see die ceases to experience our existence.

Like 2.5-5oz chorizo 

1 avocado (any size, I just have large ones)


-Whisk the eggs, diced tomatoes, and half the cilantro together. Put in a buttered or oiled pan/skillet. 

-Wait for the bottom of the egg to be solid on the bottom but still a bit runny on top. 

-Sprinkle cheese around

-Fold egg into omelette.

-Add a little more butter, then the garlic, then the chorizo. Pour chorizo in center of Omelette. 

-Add Avo's on the side.

Some people can be walking lies for all we know and behave like they're your friend only to find out they've been using you. Having to always second guess yourself around someone is as stressful as it is entertaining to watch. Psych can be gory or purely non-violent. I don't think physical horror can do that.
