has a net negative effect as a suicide prevention message.   For one thing, many of our OPs truly have no family members who are even safe, let alone supportive, to talk to you.  Make impossible promises to such vulnerable people tends to reinforce their sense of despair and failure.  

Also, being told things like ""you matter"" when people can't *feel* it usually backfires.  

It's brave and beautiful that you're already thinking of channeling your grief into suicide prevention, but please, please, *please* educate yourself about what is and isn't helpful, and even more importantly take some time to process your own grief before you try interacting directly with people at risk.

When someone is in deep despair letting go of their suicidal thoughts completely can feel like an invalidation of their feelings and a self-betrayal.  There are no certainties in risk assessment, especially with limited, second-hand information, but most of the time if someone says they're feeling better and/or safer, they're okay for the short term.  

Even if your friend is generally a bad sleeper, it's also pretty common for people to sleep unusually well after they finally tell someone what they've been thinking.   So that's another point in favour of not worrying fwiw.  

However, I obviously can't say for sure, and if you're still really concerned, you might try to think of some way that someone can physically go and check on him.

Sure there is.  If someone has demonstrated the kind of bad judgement that reliably leads to disaster, then it would be a failure of our duty of care *not* take all measures available not to publish that person's content.  

The verb ""publish"" is key here.  Subreddits are publishing opportunities and we have the rights to decide what, and whom, we do and do not publish.  What you're saying is just as ridiculous as demanding that a publisher print every first book that every author sends them, no matter how terrible a writer they are, because they haven't proved that the books won't sell.   Actually it's *more* ridiculous, because the book that doesn't sell only loses money.  The ability to publish in any subreddit is a privilege, and nobody has any intrinsic entitlement to it.   All your arguments appear to be based on the false premise that you have some rights in this.  You just don't.  [Since words aren't getting through to you, let me add some stick figures.](https://xkcd.com/1357/)

It's also very common to feel a sense of peace or even euphoria when we stop fighting our thoughts of suicide.  That doesn't mean that suicide is the best or only choice for us, or that we can't be helped.  

Regarding the ""meaninglessness of life"", there evidence that the ability to feel a sense of meaning or purpose requires a strong sense of connection or belonging, to the natural world, to humanity in general, or to individuals or groups.

depression,foxf0li,t3_g9spe2,1588141995.0,This point is fully covered in the [Hotlines FAQs post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr) we maintain over at /r/SuicideWatch
SuicideWatch,foxelvp,t3_g9x375,1588141644.0,"Recruiting strangers to help with kind of conversation is a very unwise idea.  If you're in over your head, you can always call a hotline yourself and get expert guidance in real time."

SuicideWatch,fow1vkk,t1_fovsc0l,1588111480.0,Please don't encourage people who are exploiting a support community for self-promotion.  Making even one post like this is a banning offense.
depression,fotfc6z,t3_g9gfsp,1588052288.0,Swatting posts like this are a criminal offense.  We've reported this post to the reddit admins.  We have screencaps so deleting it will not save you.

SuicideWatch,fomepxx,t1_fom5rlf,1587887340.0,"FYI, this type of post is actually a violation of the community rules, because messages like this do more harm than good overall."
SuicideWatch,fomenap,t3_g86q6k,1587887267.0,"Removed.  This type of message does far more harm than good here and is a direct violation of the guidelines posted in the community info.  A message like this doesn't make people in the grip of suicidal despair feel that they are loved like your nephew was (even if they are).  Hearing about loving relationships in other families usually just reinforces their sense of alienation.  

We know your intentions were good, but most of the serious harm here is done by people who are well-meaning but ill-informed.

However you'd be welcome to get some support from the kindred spirits over at /r/SuicideBereavement"

SuicideWatch,fob8vhh,t3_g6gwo2,1587657317.0,"Removed, guideline 4c. Many of our OPs are suicidal precisely because they truly have no one who loves them. Ill-informed garbage like ""just enjoy the people that love you"" is the kind of slap in the face that can send them over the edge.

Most of the serious harm here is done by people like you who are well-meaning but ill-informed.  Please read all the community info and what it links to before posting or responding here again.  Read the talking tips twice."
depression,fo8lf43,t1_fo8jc0k,1587598855.0,"We deleted it. Your circumstances don't excuse ignoring the community rules, all of which exist for excellent reasons."

SuicideWatch,fo0q8g7,t3_g4qob4,1587417756.0,"Removed, see guideline 4c in the community info/sidebar"
SuicideWatch,fo0irpb,t3_g4o3li,1587413885.0,"Please keep in mind that virtually nobody posts here because they don't know that hotlines exist and how to reach one.  Posts like this are useless and contribute to our OPs' sense of alienation, which is the most critical risk factor for death by suicide in the best empirical model we have."
SuicideWatch,fo0hn3a,t1_fnzonw8,1587413305.0,"There is absolutely no legitimate reason to ask this way.  If you want to inquire about demographic info, *say why* and make it an open-ended, not closed-ended question, as the talking tips post advises.  What you did with this question telegraphs to the OP that you're trying to slot them in or out of a specific demographic and that shows an unsupportive mindset."
SuicideWatch,fnljucp,t1_fnlfzao,1587054781.0,"> You WILL get better! 

I've left this comment up because most of it is okay, but please see point 4d in the community info guidelines.  Any kind of ""it gets better"" message is harmful and a direct violation of the community rules."
depression,fnljagj,t3_g2hs81,1587054512.0,"This is not a good question to ask the internet. Horror stories about hotlines are vastly overrepresented here - most of them are unverified and implausible.  There are a lot of people whose issues aren't a fit for a hotline or crisis line - they call with unrealistic expectations and end up disappointed.  

Over at /r/SuicideWatch we maintain a [Hotlines FAQs post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr) with accurate inside info to help people know what to expect."

Of course not.  But getting someone into a *private* conversation is a very unwise practice."
