How many eggs to I cook in the morning... 3 of course.

How many times do I hit power buttons... 3 times.

Its in the Fibonacci sequence.

Triangles...

The illuminati.

The Holy Trinity.

Who doesn't love some greed and whoever does will go to the third circle of hell is the hell off gluttonous people. Dante and Virgil find souls of gluttons who are looked over by worm monster Cerberus. Souls in this circle of Hell are punished by being forced to lie in a vile slush that is produced by never-ending icy rain.  

Three is considered a good number in the Chinese culture.

The three musketeers, and the three stooges.

Everything good comes in 3 and I love when things show themselves in 3.  I would grow the community and form a rivalry with the other numbers for the throne so three will rise to the top.  I will be fair and include all content related to the number 3.  If you've. Read this far I thank you, and you may have realized I listed 9 reasons why 3 is awesome,  9 is the square of 3.
