adhdwomen,fkb9xhc,t3_fhf0z7,1584029019.0,"My question is, what is going on in “normal” people’s minds? They say they just think about one thing at a time. What does that mean? Are they just thinking more slowly?i think about one thing at a time too, but that “thing” switches pretty rapidly but not necessarily randomly. Each thought is usually related to the previous thought in some way. Are you telling me people think of nothing. I can’t wrap my brain around that.

Here is a mini version:

My husband and I were celebrating our 5th anniversary. We were at dinner when he said he hoped our kids were having a good time with their grandparents. The next thing I say, passionately, is a whole tirade about teen pregnancy and how sex education in the US has to get better. “They just don’t realize the consequences of their actions. They NEED adults to tell the....” my husband interrupts at this point, confused, “ Wait, why are you talking about teen pregnancy?”

This happened in my head in the span of 20 seconds: I was thinking about my baby with my parents, then I thought about how our neighbors are on vacation and their kids are staying with their parents, then I thought about how teen parents never have a time in their young adult life where they can just go somewhere, carefree, without having to figure out who can watch the kids. They don’t even know what they are missing! It’s our job as adults, who have been on the planet longer, to inform these children about safe sex. How else will they know?! They’re just kids!...

I tried tracing it back for him, so he’d know I’m not just crazy and random. He just sat there blinking at me."

When I was a single mother with a little baby, staggering medical bills and lost my job, I would sell baby stuff on eBay as soon as she outgrew it (every bit helps).

I listed and sold a nice outfit that she received as a gift. The buyer lived in Italy, I am in the US. I was paying for shipping, and had no money, so I shipped it the least expensive way I could, which was still more than I could afford. 

Anyway, I sent it and the person filed a complaint that I never sent the item. I sent eBay a picture of the receipt showing that I did send it, to which they responded that I didn’t buy insurance when I sent it so once it left the US anything could have happened to it, so they refunded her the money,

She was born via emergency c-section (due to pre term labor/fetal distress) at 34 weeks and weighed 8 lbs. 6 oz.. She was, and is, perfectly healthy.

My 2nd pregnancy I used a dexcom cgm/ Medtronic pump. It was much much smoother sailing. I saw my endo pretty regularly to adjust my basal rates, which went up steadily until I delivered. My A1c was around 7 the entire pregnancy. She was born via scheduled c-section at 37 weeks, weighing in at 10 lbs 8 oz. she too , was and is happy and healthy and perfect. 

My 3rd pregnancy I had the Medtronic 670g pump/cgm. It was the easiest pregnancy I’ve had in every way. I never once had to adjust my basal rates (since the 670g doesn’t have basal rates). It just kept up with my ever changing requirements flawlessly. In fact, my A1c during my last trimester was the lowest it has been in several years. She was born at 37 weeks, scheduled c section, weighed 9 lbs 12 oz. She is perfect.

I worried so much, I think we all do, that I would do something, anything, that would harm my baby in any way. There were highs and lows, and I did my very best with the tools I had, which still didn’t seem good enough. But it was. 

I wasn’t perfect, they came out early and large, but they also came out perfectly themselves, and for that I am thankful and of that I am proud. It’s the hardest and most wonderful thing I have ever done. 

You’re on the right path to get to where you want to be, gathering information. I want to assure you, you’re pregnancy will be more difficult than most, but honestly it adds to the strength and pride you will feel having made it through. Best of luck!"

I know my blood sugars being high didn’t help matters, but it should be noted my husband and I are both tall and were large babies ourselves.

My doctor only saw me every 3 months, as usual, during all 3 pregnancies, which didn’t seem like enough, but I figured...I don’t know what I figured... anyway, I realize I am incredibly lucky with how things turned out."

Cute implies the person is precious and you want to take care them. Beautiful implies...power? I guess it’s subjective."

 As someone who doesn’t know you, and is in no way biased, just know that I cannot for the life of me see what they are claiming to see. 

Just keep on dating until you find one that works out, it’s a numbers game. Also, confidence is key, fake it till you make it, value yourself, all those standard pieces of advice really do (eventually) work if applied.  Good luck!"

They all get Hello Fresh. They all make the food in the allotted time. No problem. It feels as if THEY are the ones with the superpower, not me.

I have never commented on a makeup post at all. If I like it, an upvote is enough to express that. I commented on this because I had something more to say than “I love your makeup”."

Yet, they have still managed to learn and perfect their art, which is what this is, an art form that everyone should be free to explore if they so choose. They deserve all the praise and upvotes they receive. 

But that isn’t what I was doing. I noticed myself not noticing, and that was why I commented. I hoped to encourage the OP, to share with him and others that I have noticed tides are turning, in general and within my own mind.

It never hurts to be kind."

His makeup looks outstanding. Thus the upvotes. Why don’t you slap some makeup on, post, and see if you get a similar response?

I realize I’m being trolled, which is disheartening."
MakeupAddiction,f04eyac,t1_f03kw7s,1568386080.0,"I saw this man wearing makeup while scrolling, I thought the eyeshadow looked nice so I upvoted and scrolled on.

In other words, the first thing I noticed was not his gender, but the artistry with which his makeup had been applied. Even after noticing his gender, the fact that he was wearing makeup didn’t seem the least bit odd to me. 

10 or 15 years ago that would not have been the case. I might have thought it was cool a man was wearing makeup, but it definitely would have stood out as “You’ll never believe this. Today, I saw a  guy wearing makeup! And it looked better than mine!”.

That cultural shift, so gradual and slight I didn’t even notice it until yesterday right before I made the comment in question, IS a big fucking deal."
minimalism,f02pido,t3_d3cyvo,1568335467.0,"Congratulations! I’m 4 months out from doing the same, and I must confess, the longer I go without it the less I ever want to go back to it.

I ran into someone from high school the other day who just had a baby, AND I HAD NO IDEA! I didn’t know it’s name or what it looked like, I knew nothing.

How refreshing it was to catch up face to face with an old friend, who, due to my lack of social media, took no offense at my ignorance. 

I have more time, focus, and energy (all finite) to devote to the things and people that really matter to me. 

My relationships are better because I don’t assume I know how anyone is doing, and vice versa. I have to actually ask. Therefore, I get a real answer, not the airbrushed version we all present. 

My mental health is much better, my sleep, my anxiety, all of it. It feels silly to admit that Facebook and Instagram took that much of a toll on me, but they did."
MakeupAddiction,f01g088,t3_d38wmh,1568314246.0,"Not to get off the subject of how great this looks, but I honestly don’t think twice when I see a man wearing makeup these days. I just think “oh nice blending” or whatever. 

It doesn’t seem strange and I don’t even stop to think about the fact that it’s a man (until rn, in appreciation) and it’s one of my favorite things. 

We have a long way to go as a society, but we’ve come SO far in the past 20 years. I live in a smaller town the reddest part of the south, and I see men wearing makeup HERE. It’s great."
