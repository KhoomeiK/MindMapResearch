DeadBedrooms,fn8sj3n,t3_fzk51f,1586749126.0,The other night I had insane sex with my husband for about five hours. We had been drinking and got pretty uninhibited. The next morning I woke up and fou d 4 condoms in the living room and two in the bedroom. I don't remember the last time we did that. We haven't had sex since then but we've been pretty handsy with each other. I'm having a really good time in quarantine.

Dogtraining,fmd4p39,t1_fmbgh8p,1585959265.0,"I think a combination of intense exercise and everything else being really structured will help a lot. For example; he wakes up, goes out, eats breakfast, goes for a walk/run/play in thd yard, nap. He needs a lot of structure and routine in addition to having his play and energy needs met. Best of luck to you! High energy dogs can be exhausting, but they can also be rewarding if you can figure out how to channel energy into positive interactions."
Dogtraining,fma0gp9,t3_ftz5kt,1585880802.0,"What is a normal day like with your puppy? What kind of exercise does he get, and how do you typically play? You said going for a walk calms him. How long are your walks, and how many do you take? 

Your puppy is not abnormal, and he is not trying to hurt you. It sounds like he's frustrated and bored. GSD and malamutes are both very high energy breeds. They were bred to WORK. He needs for you wear him out! Take him for a jog instead of a walk. Kick a ball around the yard so he can chase it. Do whatever you can to expend his energy. 

Also know that herding breeds are bitey and stubborn. I would continue to put him in time out when he gets too worked up. The biting is play, and it is normal. That doesn't mean it's acceptable behavior. He has to know that when he plays that way, he's not going to get your attention, so be firm. If he goes back to biting after time-out, he gets another time out. Honestly though, if you work with him to get his energy out in other ways he'll probably be less likely/too tired to play bite. 

Edited to say that you should also consider a professional trainer, especially if he doesn't improve within a couple weeks. I don't think his biting is aggression but it could definitely be dangerous, especially as he gets bigger."

For special occasions she would wear brow gel, mascara, and orange or terracotta/brick red lipstick. She was always naturally beautiful, kind of like Sean Young with a deeper skintone and lighter hair, so the minimal makeup and bright lips looked great on her. She always had lots of makeup and she let me play with it, and I remember her taking me shopping for my first makeup in 6th grade. I used to be super into makeup but now most days I do brows, mascara, and lips, just like mom."

HaircareScience,exlkalx,t1_exlhk9c,1566414436.0,That's the one I was talking about as the original tea tree line. Lavender mint and lemon sage are the others.
HaircareScience,exkjbru,t3_ctfzom,1566391264.0,"When I get dry, flakey areas on my scalp, I like to take a 50/50 mix of coconut and olive oil and slather on my scalp. I leave it on for at least a few hours or overnight if I can.  Then I'll take a paddle brush and brush my scalp and hair, then shampoo it out. The oils both moisturize the scalp and loosen the dry skin flakes, making it easier to wash them away. 

The original tea tree line is really drying. I love the tingle but I had to stop using it because it dried my scalp out so bad, even though I only shampoo once a week. If you want to stick with the same line, look into the lavender mint. It's a lot more moisturizing but you still get the benefits of tea tree. The Briogeo charcoal scalp care line might be worth looking into as well. I personally like Shea Moisture for my dry scalp.

Edit: i forgot question 3. I always condition my scalp, and I always recommend it, whether your scalp is dry or oily. Some people are just dry and when you shampoo it strips all the natural oils out, making them dryer. Some people's scalps have the tendency to overcompensate for this by getting super oily. In either case, applying conditioner to the scalp will restore some moisture and keep either type from becoming too extreme."
