APlanetofMine,fqt8j53,t3_gjtpbd,1589633124.0,"This is just how I play, but this depends on the scenario. 

My favorite races are Technmoles and Kalypsians.

Techmoles are great for resource explosions and if you want to colonize other planets extremely fast. Low food requirements and start out with stone so early investments in some well placed mines and wells will let you expand planets fast which is necessary for a lot of the challenges. You won't feel baseline resources missing midgame, but they take a while to ascend so acquiring another race or getting museums / or other ascension paths researched is great. 

For other cases, the Kalypsians fast ascension is great for a lot of scenarios. Kalypsians in the jewelry store with gold or diamond is nasty fast for ascending, so after you get your baseline mining / well / farming under control, build into research baseline and ascension. Pay attention to your end goals ie don't use all your diamonds ascending in the total war scenario like I accidentally did the other day.

Ascension to science ratio, I'd say ascension is better than science until you get a chance to lay down the science infrastructure which is 1st foundries, 2nd presses and 3rd factories. You need several foundries going before you should even care about producing paper. I would not use my research or care about it early game unless its for rationing or astronomy or a necessary energy source. If your research options are shit then just wait.

Computers make research so much easier that early game you should just build up some books then start trying to make an electronics / glass stash while you ascend to build computers then use computers.

Regeneration wise, I don't pay that much attention to this because I tend to go early for oil and bumrush planets, but you definitely need a couple of planets with high enough regen (>20) for trees and maybe bushes, but I usually switch off bushes to watered farms pretty early on, so I can work on my oil and infrastructure. Revisit your planets often and reoptimize your workers."

AskEngineers,fqce3dn,t1_fqc0cyq,1589255970.0,"So I'll do a disclaimer in that I'm bitter at defense because I was ultimately fired so the copy/paste assignment is a pretty pessimistic view point. Forgive me this is long.

My first two years at Northrop weren't as bad for technical. I was actually in a very hands on group doing wafer level hardware building -- dry etch, dry processing. I liked this type of thing since undergrad. I had 3 different mentors who were all senior so I was able to be a junior level person on some cool development projects, plus they made me read and let me try out my own solutions on smaller R&D projects with their backing, but I still had to support an assigned production program. 

I do think that the skill set asks for me were extremely low in defense, but like so many things what you put in matters as much as what the project is. Ie a unchallenging role isn't a reason to stop my individual knowledge pursuit. Most interviews I had at NGC were personality based and not technically oriented, which is why there are lots of folks who end in roles illsuited to them like OP. Having mentors is everything when you are young, but you have to go seek them out. I followed my mentors around an almost creepy level when I was bored and thankfully they gave me their time. They also built me up out of imposter syndrome more than once.

I left that position to go to a different building because I was tired of being met with the ""that's the way we have always done it. Why change it. Push the button"" mentality. I was also banned by my management chain from working with a small development project that I loved due to politics, which was typical. I am a risk taker, so this made me mad, because I can eat a lot of boring, but I live for getting something to work.

When you're young in defense, they usually put you on very mature production programs and, such is life, when there are problems, you aren't allowed to do more than have a shitton of meetings and implement bandaid solutions. 

Engineering role #2. The copy and paste role was interesting in that I saw and was exposed to a lot, but I wasn't allowed to do a lot. My job was to review nonconforming hardware and do dispositions, copy/paste into SAP, then just sit in meetings a lot. 

But the good news was this was a flight project so I just learned everything I could about package level hardware building for flight. Biased burn in. Vibe tests. Temp cycling. PIND. Hermetic sealing. Milstandards. Papers. You name it I read it. 

4 of us supported this project and I can guarantee only me and the other guy who quit were the only two who ever read the circuit diagram and the mechanical drawings. Who could tell you that Us are controllers. Ss are switches. Zs are phase shifters. Our product has two capacitor types. Wirebondable and surface mount populated. Conformal coating and high lead on the solder joints of the DC connector are for mitigating tin whiskers. Blahblahblah. The other two wanted to play drama and gossip. Guess who was more successful there in the end? It wasn't me.

When we started having to interface more with the high level systems test group that was balls off the wall intimidating because I hardly knew anything about electrical test outside of going to the test meeting and being told which chip needed to come out. Seriously what the fuck is ripple current? I sat through some antenna and radar classes, even though my product was just a receiver because I just wanted to know more. I also started a MS in ECE at Hopkins.

My current job is package level hardware building. So dicing, wirebonding, die attach, etc. A lot of material thoughts -- cryogenic, CTE, purple plague. A lot of process and build it yourself. I've done a ton of assembly in this last year. I've wirebonded and diced things for R&D, for WFIRST and for OCI/PACE. I've done a surface mount population board build and I'm working on conning my senior level technician into teaching me to solder. There are relics from the JWST build all over my branch so that's pretty fun to see. Design and production work hand in hand at NASA which is refreshing. NGC production wasn't included in design really at all. I'm frequently asked to do things beyond my comfort level, but they don't kick me for taking time to produce a real answer.

The big big holes in places like NGC is that management and politics fucks everything up and they don't tend to value technical over playing nice and influence. Hierarchy and ""I'm the boss"" attitudes are big there. So is being chummy with the boss and nepotism. Management turn over for me was a new one every 4 months. NASA is more stable. My director straight up told me that they were invested in me when I started to waiver recently. Wow. At Northrop, I'm positive no director ever knew my name. Also no one ever cared that I solved an etch layer problem at NGC. NASA they wanted to talk all about that in my interview.

Also there is a huge knowledge and age gap as there aren't many mid level people in defense. It's super old or super young. Northrop can be a cool place for technical growth but there are definitely problems because it's old school on many fronts. You can still learn there.

NASA isn't like that at all. My group lead is an extremely technical upper midlevel dude, who has decent management skills so he doesn't power trip on us. And he always gives us buffer zones like okay you responded, we will wait if they have more questions. And ""you don't have to just jump and do this."" Contrast to Northrop, it was constant accusations of being lazy for reading something. At NASA, there is a fair amount of pressure to be in subject matter expert territory. Ie when I'm not being asked to do a ""just do it"" task, I need to be building up for when some random request will land on my desk, because we really get insane requests fairly often.

To the confidence points, it's always easy to be self critical. I am extremely so, but hitting the wall of I'm terrible I should kill myself repeatedly has hardened me to it. It is harder to fight for yourself and to choose positive responses. I learned to get on my own team and also how to navigate standing up for myself and having boundaries. There will always be someone to tear you down. If you don't see value in yourself, why should anyone else? I will never sleep under a desk at work because I felt inadequate like I did at NGC. 

I'm a minority in engineering as a 30 year old, bubbly blonde. I'm still 15 years younger than the next person on my team. I laugh and smile a lot and run around like an idiot, so occasionally people think I'm retarded.  Sometimes I am, but I'm also a good process engineer because I work at it and I learned to move on from my mistakes. I invest in me. I don't care anymore to seek external validation, because I'm doing the best I can and if they want to do it then they can be my guest. 

I also forgive myself when I'm not an expert at everything instantly. It's easy to forget that time molds us into greatness and running away from the pain doesn't let us grow from it.

If you're my closer friend then the commitment level is different and the follow on / planning aspects will be different. Firmer timelines. Focused conversation. Ie ""Do you want to grab beers on Friday?"" ""Cool Denizens work?"" ""Sure 7?"" ""Lets do it."" In this context, I know my friend drinks beers, she knows what brewery I like, I know when she gets off work and can join. We have already established somethings based on prior light social exchanges, so the planning is easy and so is the sincerity level of the invitation. 

Also the example given is ""We must have dinner sometime."" I would never say this to a close friend. Must is super formal language and cliche. If we are friends must is too formal, implies we aren't close. The sometimes leaves it open ended. Ie I don't actually intend on taking action here unless you care to force the issue / this might be okay to do but I don't care that much yet or know if I actually I want to spend time with you.

If we aren't close, but I actually want to hang out with you then I'm after your consent. ""What do you think about having dinner on Friday? What are your plans?"" Never ""we must."" Probably not ""should"" either. Those are formal and forceful for social situations where I don't know if you'd be receptive to hanging out as we haven't established a base yet. What do you like? Will you enjoy the experience? Are Europeans really telling American cashiers everything about themselves? :)

I've heard it described as the ""Coconut v Peach"" cultural difference.

AskEngineers,fnmcr46,t1_fnmbzvo,1587069083.0,"I disagree. Retention isn't entrance. A lot of what the earlier response threads are, are questions of entrance. ie I was never not encouraged to pursue what I wanted, like others have said ITT. 

I think asking the question of retention permits discussion points to entertain. I'd argue retention is a problem still. It is hard. I stay because I want to and I learned to live with the aspects that frustrated me, but yes there were points where I thought of leaving because of the feelings that are associated with engineering -- gendered or not. What do you think?"
AskEngineers,fnm8eo8,t1_fnm5a4u,1587066889.0,"Your last paragraph is excellent. You are awesome. This is exactly it. Real talk, I don't need someone on the sidelines saying I'm oppressed because I'm a girl in a ""hard"" field. Honestly, engineering is relatively cushy compared to most jobs. I grew up doing labor oriented jobs for my father's real estate empire and it sucked, so studying was night and day easier.

A lot of it comes down to women's, our, reconciling our own agency to our own gender roles. Yes, you might be labeled a bitch, but anyone knows, advancement is taking risks based on your own value. Negotiation of a salary. Willingness to accept a job. Assertion and providing value in your role. These are universal truths to all forms of working. Sometimes, assertion of value is in contrast with what women ""should be."" Didn't we move past this? Long gone are the days of my husband controlling my bank account. I think most workers have salary complaints due to the state of the world. ie why men take those higher risk jobs. A finance question, based on their access to education / willingness (need) to accept a role.

I'd argue lots of men don't want to be teachers (low salary) because they still have a societal pressure to be a bread winner, which they now have to divide with women, but their value is lost, in fact, often questioned, in a nurturing capacity.

To me the ""good old boys club"" is a fundamental thought that some of these guys don't think they should have to compete with a chick, well aren't we after the best candidate for a role?

It's all complicated. I love engineering and all the headaches are worth the build and launching something into space."
AskEngineers,fnm5cvd,t1_fnloqba,1587065373.0,Chick engineer here. I wouldn't freak on the chick and dude assignments. This is a casual form and humor deflection is all right. Don't call me a chick at work unless it's in a casual setting.
AskEngineers,fnm3azk,t1_fnm01up,1587064353.0,"Yes, I agree with this mindset, but with my own conditional. Lots of chicks aren't interested. And it is what it is. This came up on /r/gatech years and years ago, and I'll say the same thing that I said there -- who is drumming up the equality banner for men in early childhood care? Men with active father figures at young ages is such a good thing, but does no one care that men are minorities as teachers? Some of my favorite teachers were men.

I'm glad to be a girl in engineering but yes, the complaints are valid. Sexist shit does happen and it made me rethink my pursuit of passion on more than one occasion. The reality is it is hard, but quotas aren't the solution. The solution is inclusion and respect of difference of opinion.

Also girls -- be bitchy, and unapologetically smart."
AskEngineers,fnlyr8r,t1_fnlxudy,1587062084.0,"Word. I feel you. :)

Also not trying to play victim, but attempting to use my chick in engineering voice to say that dudes feel dismissed sometimes too. The girls have a floor as minorities sometimes, but we are your allies too. And we all have latitude to wonk about shit that annoys us. I'm not 25 anymore, and I'm more secure in my work, but that wasn't always the case. Occasionally, the girl thing hinders my experience, but sometimes it enhances it as well. I think people are generally nicer to me than some of my male colleagues.

Shit happens all around. Keeping the lines of communication open and welcoming the viewpoints of others who don't think like ourselves is a good thing to have in any highly analytic field."
AskEngineers,fnlw23v,t1_fnllte4,1587060731.0,"Yeah. I think this is another valid point to raise when discussions like this come up. The youth factor happens to everybody.

Don't dismiss your elders, don't dismiss your juniors. The elders have experience and random knowledge, but half of the older dudes freak out over the smallest computer problems.

Youthwise -- I have made junior level errors that made my boss want to throw rocks at me, but I also have optimism and risk taking / learning aptitude that some of the senior level dudes have lost. It all balances if people don't act like assholes or get on superiority trips."

AskEngineers,fnauwhw,t3_g0b6uz,1586804248.0,"Hey hey. I work at NASA in a microelectronics packaging group for a really specific group. It's a good time all around. The best thing is to encourage the mathematics and also reading skills until she can build into the engineering craziness. (You got years), but any advanced classes she can get into, for anything--soft skills too, is great.

There are lots of forms of packaging engineers out there, so I'm just going to stick to my arena.

A cool thing about packaging and IC building is that a lot of it is very visual and spacial.

These videos show process integration flows:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35jWSQXku74](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35jWSQXku74) and  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bor0qLifjz4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bor0qLifjz4) and  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5paWn7bFg4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5paWn7bFg4)

This is ""Materials for Advanced Packaging"" and there are some cool pictures.

Cool youtube videos of processing machines -- search for: wirebonding, surface mount population, pick and place, die attach, hermetic seal, indium bump bonding, solder reflowing, dicing saw, etc.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oR\_K43xIFek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oR_K43xIFek) (a good 50% of my job is wirebonding :) )

I personally love ""How it's Made"" as a TV show and maybe it wouldn't hold her attention, but the ""how to"" and learning processing is a big point in packaging.

Long term to learn processing skills, like others have mentioned, building things herself is great thing. Lego, learning to solder kits, a microscope, let her help fix a toilet or help set up a computer or TV if you buy a new one, fine dexterity things like sewing, programming skills, etc. Others have mentioned: FIRST Lego and Robotics leagues (my boss's daughters are the same age and are in those) and SEAPERCH.

Also don't get too stuck on a degree -- there are specific ones, but my BS is Chemical Engineering (processing heavy) and my MS is Electrical Engineering (so I learned what I was building), but a good chunk of my NASA life is ""does this fit?"" (mechanical) ""Do these materials work together? Will we have CTE problems at cryo and hit the electrical specifications?"" (materials science) ""Why don't the fabrications team talk to us before they design things?"" (soft skills). Good luck from a fellow chick in engineering."

But late at night no one is on the road so why isn't a driver's judgement allowed? Is 43 an outrageously dangerous speed? Does that mean my car is out of control?

usajobs,fi4ib8f,t3_f6ezkk,1582141751.0,"DC Suburb here: The area is crowded and honestly not that interesting. DC has money and good jobs so it's stable, but as a result that makes everything relatively expensive.

Buying a house? Not cheap, even without the prospect of kids or marriage. Condos can be okay and you can find something, but living in the district itself -- rent is high (one of the reasons why I live in College Park). The other person ITT is right about condo fees -- expect upwards of a rent payment outside of your mortgage - $300 - $1000+ for fees.

The metro is fine; however, it's not like NYC where you can simply buy a monthly pass and go unlimited (there are passes but they still add restrictions due to peak pricing). Metro has peak and distance pricing which makes the whole thing a bit more cumbersome, but not undoable.

DC culture is very corporate and workaholic oriented. Think NYC intensity (for example people will scream at you / be massively annoyed if you stand on the wrong side of an escalator) but a little more pretentious (lots of self important / type A / top of the class people here). It's a very east coast, job oriented place. The majority of people here are transplants, myself included, so it makes for a diverse area, which is good, but it's all about work here so the culture is just big government and work.
