After taking meds for a very long time, the symptoms subside but there's still a numbness and a nagging feeling that something is wrong. All it takes is a little stress, or a bad night, or a slip up and you're spiralling. And its SO hard to stop.

She's manic right now, and that probably means she'll crash pretty soon. She probably doesn't know how hellish it's been for you. She knows it's bad, but when you're manic, everything emotion and thought completely consumes you and you're not you. And when you crash you fall down farther than you thought you could. It's the flip of a switch, and you seem to understand that feeling.

I guess the most important thing is to remember that this is right now. It's not going to be forever, especially if she stays diligent and both of you are honest and communicating. And the toughest part of that is that she will lie, and she will hurt you, and you will hurt her and it will suck A LOT. You can be a support for her, a useful conversation to have might be boundaries for yourself relating to caretaking and your emotional exhaustion. It's important that you both find a balance between taking care of self and taking care of others, which will take a very long time. Be patient and love her, she obviously loves you too.

In reality, he thought that reprimanding me would get me to stop and he didnt really know any other way to say he was worried. 

Have you communicated how you want him to approach this issue? Is he educated on eating disorders and complications and the mindset behind the whole thing? Personally, I think if you stopped telling him when you purged (something I still struggle with IMMENSELY. Proud of you for that) that might cause more complications and more frustration on both ends.

Youre not being too sensitive, so LET HIM KNOW. Communication is the death of this disorder, seriously! And if things still dont work out, even with a third party like a therapist, then mayyyybe he might not be right for this. Not many people are!

Loosing weight can cause a binge/purge cycle, it can worsen the anorexia and it can affect your recovery immensely. Restricting what you eat at this moment is counter productive and will start more problemsnthan it will fix. So wait, work hard on recovery and start slowly with weight loss. I would not reccomend countung calories, macros ect. While loosing either to help prevent obbsession. Work with a dietician closely, they can prescribe the right amount excersize and food for where youre at in recovery.

Vyvanse had been such a helpful drug for both ny bulimia and ADHD. Its been a wonderful tool and I really recommend it.

I don't understand the aggressive and condescending tone you've chosen to speak to me in, and its kinda of baffling you seem surprised that I was more confused and irritated with what you've said.

Also, I was rambling earlier. I had planned to add that we do not know each other at all and everything you said was rather judgmental and rude. I was upset because I made a mistake and it ruined something I had planned for, had conversations with my roomates about and had thought about for quite a few weeks.

>I mean you’re ready to commit seppuku over shoes and chose to put off rent.

I mentioned several times this was not putting off rent, in fact I only bought the 'cheap shoes' because one of pur roomate offered help. Also, I had 90% of rent, Im not missing much but apparently thats the worst thing anyone can ever do. I had the support and encouragement of the people I live with. I got fucked over and they have been patient and empathetic. I wonder if you've ever learned that skill, you might have some more productive conservation sometime.

Instead of just staging an intervention, slowly work on asking about her day, how she feels, any problems shes having ect. Pick a good time to ask about her eating disorder and have a conversation. She will be extremely uncomfortable, angry and/or upset. For me it's a super embarrassing and shameful thing to talk about, even to my therapist, who I've been seeing for nearly 5 years and has seen the worst of my disorder. Ask what you can do, check in with her feelings often, and avoid threats and punishments. 

Make her feel as comfortable as you can be understanding, patient and kind. Honesty is the enemy of this disorder and secrecy is its food. I would encourage you to talk to her IF your close and know enough about how to handle an ED. Do research and be as supportive as you can.

fasting,etfjgxa,t1_etedzg5,1562771066.0,">The likelihood of the speed of anorexia diagnosis having any relevance to an obese person is extremely limited. It doesn't make utilizing fasting as a tool for people who legitimately need to make interventions ""unhealthy""

So, this actually a very common mindset from people who haven't personally experienced an ED themselves or through a loved one. Anorexia is often a sort of starting point for a lot of people. I have a ton of personal experience with overweight people in hospitals for extreme restrictive behaviors and/or reactive bingeing and these people were as miserable as I was at 75lbs. It is CRUCIAL to treat an eating disorder as soon as possible in an EFFECTIVE way or it will turn from ugly to worse. I was one of those obese people. I lost 30lbs in 2 months and was referred to a depression clinic and eventually a specialized eating disorder program. The reason I emphasize effective is, in my case and many, many others I've heard of or experienced, the people in treatment at a healthy weight are often ignored by staff and cut by insurance. I understand the staff has to focus on more critical cases, but in the 5 different programs I was in, especially in the 2 of which I was at a healthy weight, I got away with a lot of shit because I wasn't a critical weight and I didn't display obvious behaviors. Fasting can be a healthy and safe say to loose weight, but becoming obsessive and controlling over food creates such a cold, dark place for your mind. Imagine being at your wedding and you've fasted because you wanted to look perfect in your dress. Your body is starving and you're so conditioned to control your intake that you won't allow yourself more than a bite of your cake. You keep time of the amount hours you spend dancing, you stay on your feet because it burns more calories. Eating disorders are an awful thing to go through, and not just anorexia. Binge eating disorder is often preceded by a phase of extreme restriction and by god is it a painful disease. This is mirrored in ""yo-yo dieting"" culture. Restrict excessively until you break your diet, binge and gain back all the weight plus some. Rinse and repeat. The most effective way to control obesity is not a diet or a non-sustainable lifestyle, like fasting. Developing a healthy relationship with food and breaking emotional eating cycles through consistent nutrition and controlled portions will give the best long term results. One of my favorite roommates I ever had was a morbidly obese woman who had BED. She ate 3 meals and 2 snack everyday and worked with a dietician to control her type 2 diabetes. After several months of rebuilding her relationship with what she ate and slowly loosing a small amount of weight, she was given the ok to start mild restriction and exercise. I havent seen her in 2 years, but where she was mentally the last time I saw her vs. When I first met her ln the ward was an incredible and inspiring thing to see. The goal is sustainable and steady. 

I'm not trying to trash fasting; this is what I've learned from registered dieticians and through personal experience. If fasting is going great, awesome! I caution this approach, though, because extreme behaviors often have extreme effects and our bodies and minds are the ones suffering."

confessions,esjfad2,t3_c7z8qw,1562031966.0,"ContraPoints did a very interesting video recently on this topic. I actually watched it today, interesting I come across this.

Basically, trans people have worked so hard to be seen as a valid human with feelings and have adopted this identity of conforming. Anything outside of the realm what they deem as, what they've gathered through transphobia, 'not normal' is rejected and condoned. The problem is, not only is this hypocritical, it's extremely exclusive and can seriously damage a person who is figuring themselves out. Those 'xe/xem, catkin, moonsexual' people are simply a person finding themselves out. A LOT of trans individual identify as non binary before becoming comfortable with the opposite pronouns.

It's very similar to that phase you had in middle school where you identified with a new sexuality every week. I had that, many friends had that, and I imagine it wasn't a weird phenomenon confined to one middle school on the middle of a corn field. Why should we care? Why should anyone care? Theres really no reason to exclude people that don't fit our norm and the fact that transphobia is so blatant in the LGBT+ community is insane. Turning down someone for the same reason we were turned down, or hating someone for the same reason we got kicked out at 16, got bullied, beaten, killed and the very reason we fight tooth and nail for the right to be seen is hypocritical and insane. 

If someone says they are something, that is what they are. I dont care if it's crazy or stupid or weird, it's their reality at the moment and I'm going to see it too. This kind of transphobia is like that second hand embarrassment you get from watching your friend bomb a performance at a talent show in highschool. You don't want that person to ruin anything and you've worked so hard to be seen and accepted and that kid you associate yourself with is going to get you in trouble with the popular kids. I get it, but there's actual HATE going on in this mindset at the moment and it's making my skin crawl. Caring what other people think of us is exactly what pride month ISN'T about. It's about being seen for everything we are and not giving a shit. Same goes for non binary and non conforming individuals. 

Pride is about love, being seen, and encouraging those around you to do the same."

I spent my entire highschool career in hospitals and outpatient centers, I was consistently depressed and medications weren't working. It wasn't until my mom had a screening done for my sister where she was diagnosed with ADD did symptoms click into place. My mom hinted that maybe I should take one of my sister's Vyvanse and see how it goes and suggested mentioning our suspicions to my psychiatrist. The meds worked like a charm and my doctor said the tests suggested the severity of my symptoms were in in the 60-80th percentile of people my age. I was prescribed a pretty high dosage and after an adjustment period of struggling with loss of appetite (something I hadn't experienced in years) and insomnia things started very quickly clicking into place. ADHD/ADD is common in anorexia and bulimia because of the stimuli the behaviors give, and anxiety and depression can ne results of lack of healthy stimuli. Dissasociation is our brains way of relieving stress, i.e. chronic bordem. With my meds my weight finally stabilized, I actually started to be excited about going to class, and life was generally 10x more enjoyable. My focus shifted from my body to discovering a new world and all the support systems and therapies I had in place started to work. 

I guess the point of that is thats its totally ok add another diagnosis, because recovery is all about dealing with or fixing the things in your life that cause discourse.

EDAnonymous,era10zz,t1_er8vor0,1560633852.0,"How long were those periods of recovery? It took me almost 3 years to start being able to accept my body and function with a rational mindset. Even now, I still spend most days struggling. On average it takes 7 years to recover, and decades to be 'fully recovered'.

A lot of my recovery was learning acceptance, giving up control and focusing my energy else where. I started learning how to communicate more effectively and working on my depression and ocd. Bit by bit it became easier. Instead of looking at the whole picture, I had professionals help break it down into little chunks I could manage.

Basically, I realized there is nothing I can't do. If someone presents me with a challenge, I take it on, no excuses. Problem solving and flexibility are key and not giving a shit is helpful. You say you know exactly what you would feel like of you tried recovery. Would those feeling stay forever, or would they change over time? I certainly felt that way, I certainly relapsed, and I absolutely accepted I would never be better.

I realize I can't change any of your minds. Listening to speeches and reading books never did more than take up my time. It takes a decision you must make and stick to. That's completely up to you, not anyone else."
EDAnonymous,er8tqeb,t3_c0w2bd,1560611557.0," I feel sad reading reading this thread. My thoughts were the exact same 3, 2 years ago. Basically, I reached a point I could not function with my anorexia. I didn't eat, ever. I was terrified of everything but water. And then, because I spent 6 months biking 3 hours a day and eating nothing but peaches and cucumber, my body broke and I started binging. Hours a day, thousands of calories at a time. Naturally I gained weight, and I blamed myself for being weak and a failure. I almost died in a suicide attempt and spent 9 months in various treatment centers and programs. 

 It took me a year of finding a new purpose after treatment for me to actually start recovery. The scariest part of that process is letting go of the safety of restriction and something you call home. It gave me security, power and purpose, why let it go? Because goddamn you will be so much happier, so much more vibrant and there will be no more fear or avoidance of something so normal and everyday for everybody else. Yes its hard, so fucking hard, but what is there to loose? If you needed an organ transplant and would die after spending many years isolated and in pain if you didn't, but there was a major recovery period, wouldn't you do it anyway? If you want a purpose, find that purpose in bettering yourself. Heck, you can even put that focus into fitness and health and say fuck you to the disorder thats tricking you into destroying your body and mind. I found mine in art, specifically ceramics. Through that I found the best friends I've ever had, the love of my life, and a brand new veal for living. It's really incredible once you get through the scary parts.

Everything telling you there is no reason to recover is part of the eating disorder. The mistrust, the delusions and the false hope that everything will be alright is keeping you trapped. Think of a victim being groomed into staying with their abuser. It's that disgusting. I promise with my whole heart its not a trick, there is a reason why this is a disorder and why people die from this. It doesn't matter how thin you are, your body can give in at any time. It doesn't matter how sick you think you are, you're still sick. You're worth treatment, you're worth feeling better. It's an unthinkable act that takes many years of very hard work, but hey, arent we used to that?

My therapist, who has been seeing me for almost 4 years now and has watched me grow up from a scared, scarily thin 14 year old to a confident and powerful adult, brought in a former patient of hers. She was one of the youngest girls my therapist (Lisa) had when she started treatment. They had met in inpatient and Lisa basically became her one to one for several months. Many years later, that little girl is a beautiful harp player helping young kids with disabilities. I asked her how she had the energy to get through recovery and commit to it. She thought for a second and eventually said, ""If you put as much energy into getting better as you did being so sick, where would you be now?""

That remains the most impactful things ever said to me."
EatingDisorders,epw234v,t3_bw8qk4,1559562921.0,"I know it sounds absolutely horrific and out of the question, but tell him. It will be hard and messy and there will be a lot of discomfort on your part and confusion on his, but quite honestly he probably already knows. My boyfriend of 9 months knows when I purge, and when I told him I was still active in my behaviors (he knew I had struggled in the past) he got sad and concerned b it he told me he already knew. 

I know the idea of trying to recover is the worst and you don't feel ready or you don't want it, but fuck it man what's the worst that could happen? It took my almost a year of constantly going in and out of inpatient and residential to just say ""fuck you this sucks and I'm going to get back to life now"". I always excused myself with the whole I'm not ready, I don't want to, I'm not in a good enough place to stop, but honestly that's all bullshit. You're never ready when you start, and you still aren't halfway through. But what's the worst that could happen? You gain weight, feel happier, and have the ability to love your husband a little more.

Really, the only way to resolve this problem is to talk to him. Just vent, say everything you've wanted to about this and continue doing it everytime you want to purge. It won't be 100% effective and most of the time you'll only talk after the fact, but again, what's the harm? Give it a try, take a leap. Its been a while since you've felt at peace, I promise it'll feel good one day."

AskReddit,eobh6vy,t3_br7zx9,1558442192.0,"I was in a coma for 3 or 4 ish days after an intentional OD on Ambien, Regulin, anti depressants mixed with some alcohol. I was more or unless just unconcious, but I remember the first time I woke up, it was EXACTLY like those movies where you're flashing in and out and there are disembodied voices everywhere and people working on you. It was very weird. 

I remember waking up a few times once I was out of critical condition, mainly to throw up from the narcan. Apparently, I had a seizure, I had cyanosis, blood was coming from my mouth and nose, my blood sugar dropped below survivable and then shot up into diabetic coma zone after a glycerin shot (I was severly underweight and I guess they didn't take that into account) and I had a breathing tube for most of the time. When I woke up, all I knew was that my throat was very sore and my entire body felt like actual chewed up garbage. Other than that, I had no clue what happened. I just remember taking everything and falling asleep and that was it."
