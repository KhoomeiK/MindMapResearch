(Manipulation¬†is the skillful handling, controlling or using of something or¬†someone. ... But this word also has some negative connotations ‚Äî a manipulative person knows how to twist words, play on emotions and otherwise manage a situation in a sneaky fashion to get what he wants.) 
Manipulation isn't always a bad thing, someone can manipulate us for the better and we'll thank them. But in this case they wanted her to stay which would have been the worse option for op. The parent is selfish because, if you have children you have to deal with the fact that they are humans with their own interests, boundaries, and comfort zones, and won't take your bullshit forever."
AmItheAsshole,fo1bcag,t3_g54rv1,1587429609.0,"NTA You've accidentally had an allergic reaction once and it wasn't going well. I would guess you're a little traumatized, but I'm no expert, (though i do have experience since i have an eating disorder to certain foods which im scared of because of how my body will react to them. Because of ongoing intolerances against food.) It is actually very serious and your Dad telling you your fear is unfounded is mean and not understanding. You're sacred and that is valid. Of course you have to understand that it is annoying to them but they have to understand its terrifying for you. They'd be scared to if they had to eat something that may or may not kill you and reassurance isn't going to get rid of the anxiety about it.  They have to understand that there are certainslfoods that are safe because there is no way egg could be in there. and food that you are very cautious about. talk to them again how eating can be comfortable for all of you and plan ahead."

AmItheAsshole,fo18gu4,t1_fo0v5x5,1587427898.0,"It was manipulation, whether it was intended or not, is up for debate. But she is guilt tripping her daughter like 24/7 and her finally saying that that's not ok and part of the reason she is leaving is not harsh its just stating facts. A parent child relationship is about the child not the parent. I know she is almost an adult but still not fully. And the way her mother is treating her is probably affecting her every day life, tho i dont want make assumptions."
AmItheAsshole,fo17vnp,t1_fo0va6q,1587427549.0,"How is stating facts manipulation, I dont get it. She tried to talk to her mom but she threw everything about her feelings right back in her face. So finally having enough you annoyingly give them an answer they didnt want to hear. As a parent she shouldn't act like the child, especially because 18 years isn't even that old."
AmItheAsshole,fo17hys,t1_fo0von4,1587427325.0,"Yeah cuz the manipulation hurt her for 18 years lashing out once against someone who was supposed to support you in your independence, but is trying to manipulate you into not getting any more independent. i think it's just fair. especially because op said a normal conversation with her wasn't possible because she would throw it right back at her."
AmItheAsshole,fo1714x,t3_g52bvr,1587427053.0,"NTA i get it my moms kinda like this too, moved out early as well.
You try to talk to her about it and she doesn't listen to you, thats why i dont get all people saying you're the Ahole. Manipulation thats been going on this long is taking a toll on your mental health. facts. And as the parent she should be supporting you emotionally, because you're on the next step to your own independence. She's hindering that by guilt tripping you into staying or something like that. Parents make mistakes, and when shes ready to talk to you again try to create a new dynamic. the time spent separated, gives both of you time to think about what the other needs, and what you need in that relationship. see if it's compatible, make some compromise see if living apart is gonna make a difference in your relationship. Even if the otber think you were harsh but lashing oit like this once, opposed to the 18 years of manipulation and being forced into a toxic environment, is nothing"

Attacking people is also not helpful as it manifests their thought in not deserving help and therefore not being able to accept the support they need.
