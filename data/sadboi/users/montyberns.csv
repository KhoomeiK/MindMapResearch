Essentially I didn't move out for several months while this was going on and the situation with her got worse and my depression got worse. The two things that really seemed to help were that I had actually just started medication for my anxiety at the time that really helped with my depression as well, and I finally got away from her and the terrible situation I was in.

Like it's been said, yes there will be people who contract it, people will die, we can't stay completely closed forever.

It’s definitely a bit smaller than my Sprees Graphic, but had fewer features, like the rangefinder, the rear shutter, the weird “sports viewfinder” thing that comes up out of the tops of the front standard. One thing that I think it had that the Speed Graphic doesn’t (I cant be sure because my Speed Graphic is stuck at work right now) is a drop bed that allows you to do a short maybe half inch drop on the front standard.

Overall I’d say it’s a good camera to get started on LF with. It’s what I got started with at least. A monorail might give you more opportunities to learn all about movements and how to shoot large format, but I’ve always found that it doesn’t suit my style and they’re just too cumbersome to actually be useful for any of the work that I do.

Darkroom,fph25zz,t3_gd02p1,1588613640.0,Very cool. Do you have any object images that show how it looks overall rather than just a scan of the image area?
AnalogCircleJerk,fpgv7vl,t3_gdbgdh,1588610112.0,You're absolutely the asshole for not punching him in his stupid ignorant face.
ripcity,fpguy2z,t1_fpgstxv,1588609973.0,"I mean, the whole series is just a giant ""Yeah, that was an amazing team that beat the shit out of my favorite team and ruined our shot at a championship."" for pretty much any NBA fan of that era."
hiphopheads,fpgu3rx,t1_fpgqbv9,1588609540.0,The Fine Print is honestly the most perfectly suited beat to Doom's style out of anything he's made.

vinyl,fpeftpd,t3_gczs8i,1588546726.0,"lol, just pulled [this](https://i.imgur.com/xw14BPT.jpg) out of storage to clean some records the other day. Been a loooong time since I’ve been there."
vinyl,fpd2cyz,t3_gcojk9,1588518357.0,"It’s a time investment, and to be sure there are things to like and dislike about a Ken Burns documentary, but his series on jazz is pretty thorough and let’s you get a good feeling for the different genres and the key artists that formed or excelled in them. Gives you a decent little taste of many of their sounds too so you can kind of sniff out what you might kinda like.

My personal essential albums are Mingus Ah Um like you’ve already been suggested and have coming.

Herbie Hancock Headhunters as a fusion experience.

Thelonius Monk Monk’s Dream as a personal favorite piano bop album.

Sergio Mendez The Swinger From Rio is the quintessential bossa nova album.

Preservation Hall Jazz Band So It Is is my favorite contemporary joint that’s an accessible fun swinging album"

Aka Dune Breeze?"
madisonwi,fp9m13u,t3_gbsw20,1588429529.0,"Had to stop in quickly at Jenny Street Market yesterday and was blown away by how few people were wearing masks. In such a tight confined space as that, it just made no sense that out of the maybe fifteen people in the store only myself and I think two other customers were wearing masks."
hiphopvinyl,fp7cff7,t3_gbqmu9,1588368007.0,7 years on and this is still some production that I can't get enough of. Cemented Black Milk as one of my favorite producers and made me respect his ability to do a full length that I'd spin over and over.
goodyearwelt,fp6v0nt,t1_fp6tr66,1588359060.0,"It's good. Nice to have family around, and I really love my job. But I definitely miss Chicago, Seattle, and Portland. I prefer the city, and Madison is just barely on the verge of feeling a bit too small."
madisonwi,fp65ky3,t3_gbhnap,1588346483.0,"Please please please don’t contribute to the flocks of people filling the parks and bike paths last weekend. Dozens of people lined up on Atwood for ice cream, James Madison completely packed with people not even wearing masks, the bike path seemingly at a standstill as cyclists and pedestrians filled it all the way around the lake.

Yes, find some way to get some fresh air and sit in the warm sun, but I implore you to not go places where people might gather. Especially not in order to take a couple of photos. I’m saying this as an artist and lifelong photographer. There are very few photos worth contributing to this already difficult situation."
largeformat,fp634gu,t1_fp5o1q2,1588345167.0,"Adding on to this. Diluted HC-110 or Rodinal are cheap, shelf stable for long periods of time, and tend to work remarkably well with most of the very inexpensive traditional black and white film stocks. Also if you’re in the states, look into getting some Arista Edu sheets from Freestyle, it’s Fomapan but cheaper."
hiphopvinyl,fp55qjf,t1_fp4u350,1588317208.0,Its definitely been well loved.
AnalogCircleJerk,fp4sfw1,t3_gb7do8,1588306218.0,"If selling Leica medical equipment to dentists isn’t the easiest diversification of a business to ever be proposed, I don’t k ow what is."

hiphopvinyl,fp4nj1a,t1_fp4cjf6,1588302955.0,"Yeah I was amazed it played without skipping hardly at all through both discs. Could use a better cleaning at some point, but for I think $10 I can’t complain.

I’m all about Zealots. Probably Lauryn Hill’s best verse as an MC."
goodyearwelt,fp4mtua,t1_fp4kqoy,1588302507.0,Yeah I’m originally from the PNW and have a friend who moved out there from Wisconsin and would bring it back with him when he would visit. Drove me crazy to not be able to get it until my sister moved to Madison and I moved to Chicago. Gave me plenty of opportunities to smuggle it across the border. Though I’m definitely just as happy now being able to get it whenever I want.
goodyearwelt,fp4ml41,t1_fp47p9i,1588302355.0,"I’m in Madison where my sister’s family (and now my mom, because of my nephew) is. So I’ve been able to go out to New Glarus a few times as well as a few of the local places around here. I’ve been to Milwaukee a few times but haven’t had the chance to stop in at any breweries while there. Definitely interested in checking out a few of those smaller ones."
analog,fp44e6h,t1_fp3pwni,1588291457.0,"I mean, head on over to r/analogcirclejerk and it’s probably said as much as it’s posted here."
ArtHistory,fp4425j,t1_fp2gnqm,1588291268.0,Beans and bacon. A winning combination.
goodyearwelt,fp42046,t1_fp3wlf1,1588290126.0,"Looking forward to doing it someday. Only been in state for about 11 months, though my sister has been here over a decade, and I was in Chicago for a few years of that, but I’m really wanting to make my way through a lot of the breweries I’ve been enjoying here."
