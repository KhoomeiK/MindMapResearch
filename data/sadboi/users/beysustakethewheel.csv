Her (female, democrat) governor puts them on a shelter in place and wants them to wear masks, and people can’t work...in her mind, this all translates to the left wing apocalypse she’s always feared—america has lost its freedom, she thinks.

Oh, Joe didn’t go to prison for having tigers in a cage. He went because they found tiger skeletons that were shot in the head, which is an illegal way to put them to sleep. Otherwise, his zoo wasn’t illegal. Neither is Carole’s. Zoos, for profit like joe’s or nonprofit like Carole’s, have government regulations, and they have yearly inspections. For Carole to go to prison for that, she’d have to break an animal abuse law and get caught or the law will have to change. It’s illegal to NOT have tigers in cages here. They aren’t native to this country, so if they are let free, they will kill animals (and humans), and it will throw off our local ecosystems. So if you have tigers in America, you have to cage them. Their native habitats are India and the Himalayas. 

I disagreed that prison is useful for traumatized people that have never been professionally treated. A lot of countries don’t have a punitive system: it’s rehabilitative or restorative. They have safer communities and low crime rates. 

And rapists don’t go to prison in America. Most go unreported and 98% that are reported never see a day in prison. Rapists go free here, and they are also in all kinds of positions of power that make it harder to prosecute them. Prison guards, police, politicians, and wealthy people are hard to get into prison, regardless of crime, in this country."
TigerKing,fornazi,t1_forar5q,1588015129.0,"Thats your opinion, but I disagree. I don’t think prison corrects the behaviors that stem from trauma, as it adds more trauma and tends to make people worse, thus making our communities less safe and our crime rates higher. A lot of places in the world aren’t using punitive measures to combat behavior that stems from trauma and mental illness. My best friend’s brother went to prison at 18 for selling weed: he was raped and abused in there. When he came out, he murdered two people. He is now in prison for another 22 years. I highly doubt he will come out improved. 

There are definitely other solutions. When a dog has been abused, you don’t beat it up more and hope it becomes kind as a result. The punitive nature of our country without psychological considerations is one of its biggest problems. Empathy isn’t a bad thing, especially when thinking about children who were traumatized by poverty, domestic violence, and rape, and then become abusers themselves. Both Joe and Carole showcase these behavioral traits. Rehabilitation and restorative justice programs abroad are miles ahead of our system and cheaper for taxpayers in the long run. They also don’t come with the hypocrisy of allowing criminal abuse on criminals for the very abuse we morally condemn. That’s not to say Joe and Carole are innocent people. But their behavior doesn’t come from nowhere. 

I’m coming from a background as a trauma specialist, and I get a lot of hate for presenting this idea. Unfortunately America is only interested in help for perfect and wealthy trauma victims, which is not the majority: otherwise, they are interested in revenge and enacting more pain, which continues the cycle of violence and abuse. 

I also don’t think the documentary presented any substantial evidence of guilt aside from conjecture. Because her husband got his wealth from the drug trade and illegal activity, I don’t think other possibilities can be ruled out. Even his lawyer admitted in a recent interview that he believes he was thrown out of a private plane over the ocean by one of his illegal business partners. I wouldn’t be willing to put someone in prison with so little evidence. Though I’m not saying this means she’s innocent: she very well might not be. But the only evidence presented is that she was interested in securing his wealth after he disappeared and that they fought over his cheating. That’s not enough for me to sentence someone to prison. I know it’s an unpopular opinion and I’m not looking to fight about it: People love to believe they can make valid snap judgements in a short amount of time based on intuition. To each their own. I personally think that’s dangerous. 🤷‍♀️"

But then when rewatching I noticed that Rick’s the one that constantly misgenders Saff, while in video footage, you hear Joe and others refer to Saff as “he,” so if he lived there over a year, there’s no way he didn’t know that Saff is trans and prefers the male pronoun, so him refusing to use it when he *knows Saff well* just shows he’s a douche. I understand strangers making an honest mistake. But when it’s someone you know and you do it, you’re just being disrespectful.

And to pretend that white supremacy is not the reason WHY the language elevated class and castes within a capitalist and colonial framework also makes little sense. It’s not just that the language magically manifested and became important. That’s not how language changes work within a global context. But I wasn’t trying to make a value judgement against English or say any other language should be spoken instead. I was just articulating the linguistic history for someone that didn’t understand why Indians would speak English at all. I wasn’t trying to make any social justice arguments either, but I would never call the attitudes of the oppressed and disenfranchised in history anywhere to be nonsense.

You clearly know very little about drugs. It was definitely weed: no other drug mimics that. As I said, I worked in rehab: I can definitely tell the signs of various drugs. 

And weed is widely used for PTSD. I got treated for PTSD and I have a medical marijuana card: it’s MEDICINE. When I went to the clinic, it was all veterans and people with cancer and people going through various other health issues. I never touch anything but weed. I know weed is not legal in Oklahoma, but it’s likely the only thing he has affordable access to without health care. And it helps. That’s the reason we admit it: there should be no stigma about medicine. Weed should be legal.

The only people in the doc who you saw actively high on or coming down from meth is Travis: the scene where he threw a fit, mad at Joe, is a more typical meth withdrawl—it can be exceptionally anxious. Two others were drunk (long haired guy and guy in the bathtub). 

Frankly, I don’t blame him for being high on pot. In my state, it’s legal and it’s most highly prescribed for PTSD and anxiety, and many of us don’t consider it a drug in the sense it’s not physically addictive. We consider it medicine.

If you don’t want to donate, you know no one is asking you, right? This isn’t taxes—it’s a fundraiser. If you don’t want to help, you can just *not.* No need to be a dick in a public forum to someone that needs help so *they* can function and enjoy life again. If other people want to help, so be it. It’s Easter in a pandemic for god’s sake—let people be kind to each other. Damn."

TigerKing,fn8jc63,t1_fn8eisj,1586742963.0,"Libertarians are against *government* welfare and any coercion of citizens based on government power. Asking for financial help, given freely, when your employer didn’t provide healthcare would be the kind of social self reliance libertarians believe in. They believe communities can and will function benevolently and efficiently independent of the government. 

However,  he’s not a libertarian anymore. While his Facebook still says, “proud libertarian,” he posted at his one year anniversary of separating from Joe Exotic that the trauma made him rethink his political views. In the past primaries he liked Warren and Biden and then posted that he voted for Biden. People change 🤷‍♀️ it’s life."
TigerKing,fn7dbyi,t1_fn7ca40,1586718090.0,"I see what you’re saying and thanks for your response. It’s hard to make definitive judgements on what motivates him: We saw him for a grand total of maybe 15 mins, so none of us know him. But he did *say* that was the reason on the doc, and that’s a super common thing with PTSD. He also said it was the worst year of his life."
TigerKing,fn7cuby,t1_fn7a0d9,1586717815.0,"I’m currently receiving EMDR, and it’s changed my life. But we are different: I “sure as hell” don’t deny people empathy who suffer. Nor do I feel I can make arbitrary and oversimplified judgement calls on if someone is good or bad: I actually think people are much more complex than a simple binary and “bad” behavior is motivated by a lot of different things. I wouldn’t deny health care to anyone, even people in prison. 

So, go ahead, honor your local communities. It’s a go fund me, not a theft. No one is making you donate. It’s baffling why you think you should tell others not to help, but do you. 

I personally don’t see man made lines around cities, towns, states or countries as guidelines for a hierarchy of who deserves compassion. I talk about the issue to stick up for people who suffer like I do, and yes, a lot of people have no clue and malign people with PTSD as simply “bad people.” 

I, too, hope you develop some tact, because how can you make such a cruel and callous statement about someone who suffers the same thing you say you did? 

Happy Easter."
TigerKing,fn7bimn,t1_fn7aj3x,1586717068.0,"On the contrary, it’s incredibly common. He even said in the documentary that he felt bound to them in shared pain, though being where he watched a friend shoot himself was horrible for him. In soldiers with PTSD, we see this a lot. Not only are they tightly emotionally connected to people that shared their trauma, many who leave it untreated often re-enlist and ask to be deployed to where their trauma happened. It may not sound logical to people without PTSD, but trust me, this illness isn’t logical. 

We even see this in children with complex PTSD: they will very often actively resist and grieve the idea of leaving the parents molesting them or beating them, even going so far as to lying for them to CPS. 

Trauma induced behaviors with a mental illness operate in ways that make little sense to many people, but since Vietnam we know so much about it and have even developed really effective treatments. Still, due to a lack of access to health care, 20% of our veterans end up in prison with untreated PTSD for behaviors that stemmed from their traumas."
TigerKing,fn78v54,t1_fn6iwxi,1586715560.0,"Lol. Fine. No one is putting a gun to your head and making you donate. So, don’t donate, but don’t dismiss real trauma either, especially when that trauma is a major cause of violence. You shouldn’t say you refuse to help trauma because of violence when the major symptoms of PTSD are flashbacks and violence, which can be successfully treated with EMDR therapy. And if you DO have PTSD, as you say, your comment was wildly shocking at how uninformed it sounded. 

Also, every human being is a part of our community—being on two episodes of a doc doesn’t make someone less human and he’s far from a celebrity. He didn’t get paid to be in it either. But yeah, if someone appearing on your tv automatically disqualifies them as a human being deserving of empathy in your eyes, then fine. Keep your $25, which will pay for 15 mins of therapy. I do hope you’re *actually* really compassionate and helpful to others, because untreated PTSD after witnessing a trauma is shattering, and it takes a huge toll on our country."
TigerKing,fn66vyj,t1_fmoy6ms,1586689783.0,"1) that happened one month after he watched a man shoot himself in the head—it’s called PTSD. It’s the reason why 20% of veterans end up in prison. As someone who has it, I can attest it’s debilitating and often disorienting when you’re triggered. 2) it happened with a family member attacking him and calling him homophobic slurs. 3) Even without this context, denying any human being necessary health care, including mental health care, is cruel. Perhaps if you don’t want people wielding weapons, you should support mental health care for all."

TigerKing,fn4xjjy,t1_fn49ml6,1586651162.0,"Actually, I’m of the mindset that rape isn’t funny for anyone, not just myself, though I have been raped too, and I’m receiving PTSD treatment for it. It’s a traumatic human rights violation, and many people suffer cruel and unusual punishment in prison due to rape—even and especially kids and innocent people. But I can’t argue with those that adore rape and are homophobic enough to say things like, “stick it up your ass.” It’s amazing how cruel people show themselves to be at a time when we need more compassion. I hope no one violates you that way and then you watch people laugh about it. This mindset is exactly why men have such a hard time getting help after rape: everyone thinks it’s funny, rather than an injustice. 

Ps. Get a better sense of humor. This is dumb people or teenage bigot humor. Being gay or raped isn’t a punchline."

My little brother went to prison at 18 for drug charges and was raped. It fucked him up. It’s not a funny condition to put any human being in.

WildWildCountry,fn2mq84,t3_fyvc7l,1586594842.0,"India was colonized by the British. Think of Gandhi—his purpose was to resist the occupation of British forces through non-violent revolt. Like other places colonized by the British, this led to British schools, white supremacy, and other issues. As you can imagine, it’s important for the occupiers to be able to communicate with natives, and language diversity becomes a part of its history. Many, if not most, (at least most middle class to wealthy) Indians speak English. I taught international students for a long time, and most my Indian students had an Indian accent, but English was their first language at school and home. 

Think of it a little like when the British colonized the native Americans here, and then they were forced into schools to learn English and Christianity. Now, when you meet Natives, they are likely to speak English fluently as a first language, and they may also practice and/or study a native language amongst their community. Colonization has that effect."

When he talks about driving off a bridge, they show a picture of him in a police uniform and he mentions he was America’s youngest sheriff. He also has on his EMT jacket when Saff loses his arm (my guess is he was dual trained because it’s a small town with little serious crime).

I live in the small town he was police chief of. Admittedly, it is a tiny town, only a few hundred people back then, where not much happens, and he wasn’t police chief for long. He was 19 when he began and 21 when he drove off the bridge, so it was really still his kid years. After that, he managed a pet store for a while before opening the zoo."

TigerKing,fmo87ko,t1_fmm73pq,1586249062.0,"It doesn’t make that much sense to compare whose trauma was handled better: trauma is trauma, and it manifests differently in different lives. And frankly, we don’t nearly know these people well enough to make huge judgement calls on the whole of their lives. 

But it is worth noting that their are very insidious arguments about organizations like Big Cat Rescue. 

1) For one, it’s a nonprofit, but Carole DOES profit. The CEO makes their own salary pay. And the only thing they are *not* allowed to profit on is donations. But the money they get from Facebook popularity, the money from gift shops, the ticket sales, that’s profit. It goes to the general fund to use however they want. So she does exploit animals for financial profit. 

2) As such, they have a motivation to shut down private zoos beyond animal well being: it gives them a monopoly on the market. 

3) Many will argue that their mission to give a more free life to animals in captivity makes them better, but there are two questionable/debatable things with this: 

a) If there are no private zoos that allow breeding, this definitely means extinction. These are nearly extinct animals, and we have more in captivity than in the wild. If *only* orgs like hers exist, and we don’t fix the poaching in natural habitats and the environmental climate change that’s making these animals extinct, then without human breeding, these animals we claim to love DO become extinct. So supporting her org supports extinction. 

b) animal rights activists and proponents of her bill have been accused of doing really shady animal activity to get the bills passed. For instance, there are several times in which a private zoo has been broken into and animals released, knowing full well the cops will have to kill exotic animals in the wild. But they recognize that this spectacle will scare the public and get the bill passed. And it’s worked in various states. So....is that caring for animal rights when you are willing to get them killed to ensure your organization is the only one that can exist? 

Carole is an animal rights activist, but there’s a big difference between her and an animal welfare activist. And they have reasonable concerns that would not paint her organization as so saintly."
TigerKing,fmo7ifr,t1_fmmqm1w,1586248282.0,It has been reported in other written features about him in the past. He was repeatedly raped when he was five years old by a man.

And then he chose really vulnerable young addicts to make them totally reliant on him and therefore beholden to him sexually. It’s grooming and it’s really abusive."
TigerKing,fmml6xm,t1_fmmcuba,1586207300.0,"Carole said in the doc that he did that often. And this guy didn’t get rich just from having a “green thumb” like his family vaguely implied. It was illegal activity. But on the day of his disappearance, apparently, he was supposed to fly commercial and his abandoned car was left at the airport. They found no record of him having booked a flight. So, who knows."
TigerKing,fmmcgt1,t1_fmlsgtu,1586202792.0,"I guess I’m wrong about the vets—when my cat died, my vet said to take it there and they would have it cremated. This was at an emergency facility in Boston. I never saw the crematorium, but they definitely did that. I don’t know if they sent it somewhere or what.  When I google it, it says some vets do indeed have them, so maybe it was because it was in a big city? I don’t know. I just know it happened. 

I can’t speak to the size of his zoo or his methods. 

In the court documents against Joe, his workers testified he shot those five tigers because he could no longer afford to feed them and he was trying to get back at Jeff before he left the zoo. They made it sound like a really traumatic experience for them all."
TigerKing,fmmbujy,t1_fmm7cez,1586202474.0,"Oh yes, I didn’t mean to imply that! The original poster said that they thought private pilots flew out of commercial airports and would not be able to even take off without a license, but I know that’s not true from my family experience. My dad is an anti-authoritarian, but he definitely wasn’t off flying to Costa Rica—carole’s husband was selling drugs or doing illegal trafficking of some sort. 

I was just explaining that it’s very possible for private pilots to do that."
TigerKing,fmmbhqc,t1_fmlppfi,1586202293.0,"Journalists who interviewed her in the past when this first became a media storm asked her explicitly about the prostitution and his illegal businesses, and she simply declined to answer. Robert Moor did an in depth feature on her and joe a couple years ago, and he said this. They left out that she ran away at 15, was homeless on the street, and her first husband was abusive and poor, so she had to continue to do sex work. Also, when someone wants to pick you up, they will drive by three times to signal interest and prove they are not a cop: it’s like a secret code in that world. She said in her story that he drove by 3 times. He’d done this before, for sure. His assistant also mentioned in the doc that she, “didn’t want to be walking the street her whole life.” 

As for the drugs too, no private pilot is going to fly under the radar out of the country without a license just because they are forgetful or dumb. That’s insanely illegal. You’re doing that only if you have a lot to gain financially by doing so. It’s a monumental risk."

TigerKing,fmlnf6k,t1_fmkpvo5,1586189759.0,"Yeah, this story does not match up, as most her stories. Carole didn’t meet him while “pacing down the road” and he wasn’t just a sad man looking for a teenage girl to talk to: she ran away from home as a teenager and worked as a sex worker until she met him. He also was known to be involved in sexual trafficking in Costa Rica. 

In addition to that, he flew illegally and under the radar because he was involved in the drug trade. And this is why he was so wealthy despite having no real job, just a bunch of weird hobbies. Exotic animal collecting and breeding started as a hobby and another illegal market for him, Carole made it into a nonprofit career after he disappeared."
TigerKing,fmllzp2,t1_fmliyqm,1586189007.0,"It’s not unusual for zoos to have crematoriums actually: that’s how most of them dispose of the remains of animals that pass away. It’s easier for them to use a crematorium than to dig huge graves for elephants or alligators or lions. Zoos don’t generally have space for a cemetery, and vets will also have crematoriums often too. Doc Antle has a bigger, fancier, and much more expensive operation than Joe’s. It’s not surprising he has one, and I’m sure Carole’s org does too. 

In a weird fun fact, Joe Exotic didn’t have a crematorium: he usually sold his dead animals to a bone museum where they displayed the bones of different animals. Joe also buried some of his animals, which was used in the trial against him."
