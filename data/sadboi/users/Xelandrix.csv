depression,f0opg84,t3_d5s8w8,1568817174.0,I do all that too. Something that helps me to think about things from a positive perspective despite this:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfYbgdo8e-8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfYbgdo8e-8)
TeraOnline,ey571q8,t3_cvg7j8,1566823829.0,"First thought: This guy has gotta be a troll.  
Second thought: Or maybe he's just dumb? Seriously, how'd you end up in Allemantheia looking for BoL?

Third thought: Or maybe Tera has been redesigned early game so many times to try and optimize leveling that they've actually made it more confusing on accident for new players."
misanthropy,evyg3a5,t1_evwuoad,1564931725.0,It only becomes villainy if acted upon. At this point it's simply philosophical discussion.
bipolar,eveb478,t3_cjcz1d,1564461170.0,The double meta here is that the therapist knows and is just proud you have enough social awareness to make an attempt at being polite. You ARE making progress. *drops mic*
depression,eveawqc,t3_cjcntr,1564460968.0,"Boredom, fear of death, and natural curiousity. Everything beyond maintaining enough income to sustain myself is based on whim of interest in the moment."
depression,ev6su3c,t1_ev6dei3,1564250989.0,"Kansas City, why?"
misanthropy,euch23w,t1_eu5o6f0,1563674891.0,"Personally? No. I don't feel I'm missing anything anymore. Does this work for everyone? Hell no. Kinda how I said in my reply, this has become a sort of: Just do what works for you."
gaming,eucckj2,t1_euc8l1s,1563671271.0,"Nothing really matters, to meeeeEEEEE!!!"
depression,eu83yhl,t3_cew6uw,1563549195.0,"I'm 30m. I'm in pretty much the same boat. Gave into the notion of fear of the unknown as a rational explanation for abandonning the idea of suicide. Still don't have much in the way of ambition. Lots of personal factors I wont bother anyone else here with, but yeah, it's just a slow death in waiting for the inevitable."
misanthropy,eu1rdnb,t3_ce4oei,1563373644.0,"For me it's always been more of a passive distaste for people. I have no friends nor real attachments to my family and I'm fine with that. I can put on a mask, do my job, go home, and be fine alone. Almost all social interaction is kept to a minimum as it drains me on a deep level. I don't mind truly intellectual discussion, but for some reason most people don't really desire a constructive conclusion to come from it. It usually meanders off into, ""Well, you do you and I'll do me."" So even that has become largely unnecessary."
depression,esvord6,t3_c97w1n,1562302019.0,"Go to a temp agency. Seriously dude. It's not hard, they're always looking for someone because that's THEIR job. Get experience, find something on your own steam after you've gotten situated. It's what I did."
depression,esvoj22,t3_c98rsp,1562301926.0,"I've had that dream, many years ago....I actually caught myself reaching out for her hand as I woke up. I cried myself awake for the first time in my life. The dream is the dream. We must toil in reality."
depression,esvnkv1,t3_c9bjpo,1562301548.0,"Stop caring what she believes. She has made her choices. Make yours. You can care about someone without agreeing with them. It's the conclusion I came to with my overtly religious mother. If she pushes the issue, you can explain that you simply do not share her beliefs. If she doesn't respect that, she doesn't respect you. If you truly believe you need medical attention, then it will always come at a high cost. Not saying it doesn't work, but it never did for me. It will hurt for a while, but if she cares about you, she'll accept you for who you are, not what she wants you to believe. The road is long and fraught with many snares, but if you can make your way through it, you'll be a stronger person for it."
depression,esvlr5q,t3_c99byn,1562300814.0,"Welcome to every day off work I've ever had. Pretty easy to do when you live alone and have no friends. Wait, does screaming into the uncaring void count?"
