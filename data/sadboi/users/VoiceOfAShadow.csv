depression,fblttuj,t3_edsmnj,1576970112.0,"Eventually everything ends. Might as well see life through.
The pain any one of us endures in our daily lives is hard, death is easy.
There's so many ways we could die without suicide.
I'm going to see it through. I don't mind people looking at me like im insane anymore.
They can't see what i see..
Best of wishes"

Now you really are depressed.
Knowing the problem means there's a solution."

Were only human with limited life spans. 

I would say.. See it through. 

Go against the tides that push us back and rebel against the world just to prove it can't keep you down. Just a thought."

depression,fawfh5i,t3_eaqn2p,1576370406.0,"I couldn't say it works for others.. But my own impending doom brings me relief.
I tell myself eventually we all die, meaning the suffering will be over one day.
Till then, say fuck it and live life right.."
