Anecdotally, I will say, I have been on olanzapine for two years on and off, and go to the gym 4-5 times a week. My blood glucose were completely normal, even a little low

Also, if we’re talking antipsychotics in general, olanzapine is notorious for leading to weight gain and diabetes. All others do so too, but to a way lesser extent. Olanzapine is one of the most effective though, so you just have to pick your battle! 

Hope this helps."

I am in medical school, so even though I was basically psychotic out of my mind, I was trying to find time in between therapy sessions to study. You can see how self destructive I am, but I digress. There was this 45-50 y/o man who wouldn’t stop following me around. I am not sure what illness he had, I know he had ADHD and maybe depression (he tried to end it). He literally wouldn’t stop asking me why I was there, because I seemed fine. My meds worked really quickly, and once the doctor made my diagnosis of bipolar, the lithium brought me back down to earth like immediately. So he just kept pressuring me to explain why I was there, wouldn’t let me study, wouldn’t leave me alone. I was never mean or excessively nice. It got to the point to when I was finally discharged, he asked me for my number. I gave him a fake number. Days later, I get a text from him. He fucking ASKED someone else for my number. I blocked him on all social media. It’s just so bizarre because of our age difference, and he was kind of creepy.
