My boyfriend is the same. I'm trying every day to try to make him realize that his desires and wishes and emotions are important too. Glad to hear that you figured this out! Good luck :))

Sidenote: this trying to please me all the time is kinda straining, because I don't always know what I want. And sometimes I want to please him too, so it's hard sometimes when this is not appreciated/accepted ;("

Some comments are weird/nonsense, but I assume these are made by children or something. Nothing out of the ordinary as far as I can tell."
Sissy,fqaotqw,t1_fqa6mp4,1589222710.0,"My boyfriend is a sissy, but treats me like I'm the only thing of value in the world. He treats me with utmost respect and his primary goal is to make me happy and satisfy me. He's able to switch between being dominant and submissive and when I'm the submissive one I like to be treated as a sissy would (a dumb cock hungry slut). It's just a fetish and roleplay, nothing to do about how to treat women."
Sissy,fpwy708,t3_gfruj9,1588972136.0,"So cool to read. My bf came out to me as a sissy too. It was hard for him, but I did my best to let him know I will support him and love him no matter what. He manages to switch in between being submissive and dominant tho. Sometimes I like to be dominated, but I can be dominant too. I can't wait to get him a proper dress. I already did his makeup twice and put him in one of my dresses, and he looked so cute.Makes me happy that your wife is understanding. From what I understand it's hard for sissies to find accepting girlfriends. I wish more girls were.

Best wishes to you and your wife! <3

Edit: I'm also pretty much a tomboy, so we like to play with gender."

A lot of the time it would be a character I had a crush on and I still do this sometimes, like I take on their manerisms and phrases. Weird. Maybe that's why I'm so tomboy-y."

I had a talk with him and said that story is not that important to me, although ofc I would like to see what it's about. But we agreed to maybe play this particular game earlier in the day and something more dumb closer to bedtime."
relationships,fortw44,t1_fortgmb,1588018432.0,"Yeah, same for me. I love the games, but some of them just makes me fall asleep, like FFIX. Maybe it's the music.

I will try that! Thanks!"

I think he doesn't mind if it's something simple without a story or something."

dating_advice,fn09udf,t3_fyar9d,1586538042.0,"As someone who have been exactly there, I can tell you it lead to emotions for me. I never thought I could get feelings for him, and never thought he would get them for me. 
For the longest time I denied having feelings for him. But eventually I realized I had developed feelings for him because of this (sleepover/cuddles), even though I was adamant I would not! It lead to a lot of heart break.

I'm not saying you will for sure develop feelings for eachother, but it is a danger zone."
dating_advice,feshk1m,t1_fenlkye,1579365223.0,"You're right. I'll probably wait until he gets back from vacation and see if he still wants to see me. I've only met him twice, so I feel kinda awkward doing the whole talk thing, but I think after a third time it might be justified. I think maybe I'll just ask him what he's looking for and what he wants out of this, because I really am down for whatever. I just don't want to go around thinking about it too much."

dating_advice,f88fl0f,t1_f88ehca,1574353844.0,What a nice and constructive reply. That's really helpful and I will definitely try to do that. Thank you!
dating_advice,f4vqq2g,t1_f4v1yc2,1571846434.0,"I guess it's just because it's starting to feel more and more like a relationship. And I do genuinly believe that he wants to be with me. He says I'm the only one he's sleeping with and the only one he will be sleeping with. But he just doesn't want to drag his shit into a relationship with me.

I'm also thinking that there is a much bigger underlying psychological issue to this, with both of us. I guess I have some shit to figure out too before I start a relationship (we both do!), one of the reasons I like hanging out with him. That I get the feeling of being in a relationship without it actually being one. Although what really is the difference... it's also fucking me up, I think."
dating_advice,f4v4qv5,t3_dlyrfd,1571836500.0,"Edit: I forgot to mention that he has autism. So his social antennas are a little off. 

The reason I like to have him around is that he really is very nice. He helps me around the house, buys me food (all the food he has eaten he had bought for us), helps me out with personal problems, like he will go out of his way to help me out. 
He's not really upset with me, I guess. Just that he feels like he's hurting me all the time and that makes him sad/upset. 
The reason he's not really ""boyfriend material"" is that he has a lot of problems he needs to sort out first. And I would like to support him, but I'm struggling to keep distance from it."

dating_advice,f30v16u,t1_f30l75y,1570562904.0,"Lol, I didn't know that! He's seems really confident, so I just assume he knows what he's talking about most the time.

I am a very emotional person and it doesn't take much to make me cry, so when I thought about it and tried to bring it up I started crying because of how it made me feel. Maybe he automaticly assumed I was accusing him of something and tried to defend himself? lol. I told him this morning that tears come very easily to me, and it's not always as serious as it seems, although it is a real issue to me. And also that he hasn't done anything wrong.

I guess it has to end at some point anyway... like I can't see me marrying him. I just don't want it to end just yet, haha.

Also, thank you! :))"
dating_advice,f30jdfi,t1_f2y7sz0,1570555673.0,"Yeah maybe. He did mention one night that he had developed feelings for me and it scared him how fast it went. And that he didn't want to just jump into another relationship (idk when his last one ended) and bring the shit from the last one in to a new one.

I did kinda talk to him and he said it had nothing to do with me, that he's just stressed about stuff and also his medication has side-effects, idk. 

I explained to him that I understand and that he's not in the wrong, and that I didn't want to pressure him and just take his time to deal with things and I'll be there when he's ready, but that I just feel unattractive when he turns me down so often, and that's why I got upset. Then he just went on a half-rant about how men get turned down all the time and I should consider how they feel. Then I just said that I don't represent all women, lol.

I guess I'm just afraid it'll end or something. I have pretty bad seperation issues"
dating_advice,f2x31vs,t1_f2x1jyq,1570473210.0,"Actually, that might be it. I know he's stressed about some personal stuff. He's just so good at hiding it, he's so calm.  
I'll just give him time and space to figure it out. Thank you!"
dating_advice,f2wzt8g,t1_f2wyxrk,1570472114.0,"Thanks, I'll try that! He tends to be slow about coming forward with stuff. He holds a lot of stuff inside.

dating_advice,f2wx8x7,t1_f2wvzsc,1570471260.0,"Kind of, but he usually just kind of brushes it off. It's confusing, because he's mentioned that it'd be really hot if I woke him up with like bj or something. But it's hard when he's so on and off about it.

He also said that he loves to have sex with me. But then, why not do it. I don't get it."
dating_advice,f2eym2o,t1_f2exgw6,1570206539.0,"I have told him how I feel, and he didn't reject me, but he didn't say that he felt the same and wanted to date me either. 

It's difficult, because obviously I have feelings for him and would like to be more than just friends, but at the same time I don't want to be in a relationship with him, for a lot of reasons that I don't feel like getting into details about."
dating_advice,f2eyirg,t1_f2esqag,1570206476.0,"Thanks, I'll try. Maybe tonight.

I can't help how I feel. But he really is not boyfriend material. Obviously, it does feel good when he treats me like I'm special, though."
dating_advice,f0j9yak,t3_cbmqqo,1568653182.0,"Kind of an update on this.

I don't remember if I mentioned this (and I can't be bothered to read the whole thing to figure out lol), but I don't want to be his girlfriend. I don't want him to be my boyfriend or be in a commited relationship with him. He has a lot of issues and he's not even really my type. 

The thing is, I kinda just want to be important to him or special to him. We've sorta opened up a lot to eachother over the last months and we've been meeting more often. We've also hung out a few times without having sex! Today he came to me and we just cuddled, ate hamburgers, watched youtube and had a nap. He's also said that I'm one of his best friends and one of the very few people he can trust. And maybe the most important thing: I told him I have feelings for him, to which he replyed with pulling me really close and holding me tight, then saying ""I don't want to say I have feelings for you, but I don't want to say I don't have feelings for you either"" and just sorta explained that he just doesn't want to label it. He wants to have the freedom to do whatever, but I'm the only one he's sleeping with (I know he could be lying, but there's several things that hints to this being true, and I kinda knew without him telling me). He's also told me that he really cares about me (in a way loves me) and that he's terrified of losing me. He also said he doesn't have a problem showing affection in public and we've gone out to eat a few times together. We also text a lot more now and conversations are more coherent lol.

Sooo, I'm not sure what's happening anymore haha. I'm happy with things right now. I guess maybe I just wanted him to acknowledge me some more, which he has, honestly."
dating_advice,ethwrxz,t1_eth1fd3,1562829827.0,"Thanks for such an honest reply! I guess I'm just kinda scared to bring it up with him because I'm afraid he'll think it's getting too seriously or something, and break it off or whatever.

He's doing like a festival thing rn so he won't be very responsive, but I'll talk to him about it in a week or so. Thanks!"
