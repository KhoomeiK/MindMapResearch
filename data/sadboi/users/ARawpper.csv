I never understood the conflicting signals, people lie a lot. It's like an elaborate charade of the neurotypicals. My mother also used to say I was the adult one of us.

I try to be comforting and caring but that always leads to people relying on me like I'm their rock 24/7. Everything from strangers to lovers.

We thought they were the love of our life because we didn't know the truth then, things change as they come to light. We are not foolish, we were simply not aware that these kind of people existed. Now we know. Now you have to accept that you will never get a sincere apology, they are incapable of giving even a normal apology haha. I too wanted one but I got attacked instead. He called me retarded and crazy, he lashed out instead of giving a sincere apology for the lies.üòÇ Bitter till the end. He took his mask off completely and just hailed the insults on. It isn't worth it to talk to these people. No contact forever is the only way.

It was the same with my ex. He would blame it on his ADHD. Funny thing is.. I have ADD (didn't know that then) and Aspergers and I almost never hurt anyone. When I do I certainly don't blame it on anything other then my own actions and I apologize and change. I try to be considerate and empathic. Turns out people can have both ADHD and Narcissism. What's shitty is when they hurt us constantly, say we aren't allowed to express our hurt or concerns because it's their ADHD, not them. The self-centred and passive-aggressive bullshit. Him being unable to cope with how he was making me feel and me asserting my needs. Exactly how you quoted him saying.

I agree, it's just an excuse and a way to mask their Narcissism, meaning they hurt everyone around them but they never take responsibility and apologize. I too think that is really fucked up, to use other diagnoses as a way out of being a decent human being. Good riddance I don't have to be treated like shit anymore and having to choke it all down myself because it's being blamed on ADHD etc. I have since talked to and spent time with a few people with ADHD who are the complete opposite of him. They have never hurt me, they are very sweet, considerate and caring. It is the Narcissism, not the ADHD that makes them assholes.

Hello friend, I'm a girl with aspergers. School wasn't easy for me either. It sounds like you too have experienced the shitty nature of ""popular"" people and rumors. Kids and teenagers and their immaturity, insecurity, ignorance, lack of empathy and toxicity. Most of them believe rumors blindly. Not all of them though. You can still find friends. Being misunderstood is unfortunately very common for us aspies, but it doesn't have to be that way.

Fuck those people that laugh at us. Truely. They can go fuck themselves. They should be looking in a mirror since that's what they are laughing at, their own projections. It's amusing when you see it for what it is. They don't know us. That little shit that spread those rumors pisses me off. But I know they don't know better.. they are very small on the inside. You can rise above it. There is also a chance that the rumors will die down or that you can stop them. But the key to happiness is not found in other people anyway. You don't need them to be happy. We can find the spark that gives us joy without people.üå∏

You can ABSOLUTELY make new friends. Aspergers doesn't mean that we can't develop social skills, it's just a bit different. I'm 24 now and things are much better. I have learned a lot about how to initiate conversations and I have worked a shit ton on breaking out of my social anxiety. I have found myself, my strengths and confidence. I used to have selective mutism in school. Now some people think I'm a talkative extrovert, somehow I'm the one that people gravitate towards. The ""popular"" one. I think being unique, honest, authentic, empathic and confident is a huge part of it, getting out of our comfort zone and embracing the quirks. The bad parts and the good parts. We won't be the same as everyone else, but we can still shine. To find ourselves and to be in our own power.‚úä

It sounds to me like your best bet is to start standing up for yourself. Show people that you aren't a toxic person just by being you. Then try to release the importance of other peoples opinion. Their opinion of you is a reflection of them, not you. They don't know you. At your age it might seem hard, but trust me it's a huge blessing to have learned to not care about other peoples opinion. Working up your inner strength, self-respect and self-love. Just do you. Sending much energy and support.

Take a leap of faith and learn how to talk to strangers. Trust that no matter what it will be for your ultimate good. I know it wont be easy at first but if you can have the mindset of not giving a fuck you will be able to do it. Try to take out the importance of it, it isn't as serious as we believe. Life is supposed to be fun, like a playful game. Talking to people isn't supposed to be such a serious and scary thing. We can practice. Every ""failiure"" is just a step closer to success. There is also the internet, you can connect to similar minds here for support. Friendship online. Gaming was something that helped me. <---

Know you aren't alone. There are many of us similar to you. Aspies. We are just spread out it seems. Like a lonewolf pack haha.ü§ó"

From the article:

I can‚Äôt breathe. They say something like 100 bush and grass fires are  raging across the state. The city I live in feels like a scene from *Blade Runner 2049* come to life in 2019. There is no other way to see it: our dead future is here.

I  felt frightened for what was happening as I gripped the wheel. The  struggle to get oxygen into my body. The growing tightness. I recognised  my system was constricting and closing down. It came to me that I was  being buried alive. And that I am not the only one. All of us slowly  smothered. Pollution levels [are rising to 22 times the accepted safety levels](https://www.dpie.nsw.gov.au/air-quality/current-air-quality/daily).  It is as if the smoke and ash is going so deep into our lungs it is entering our bloodstream and our consciousness. In the final week of our national parliament there was no word about  climate change, little sense of much that is urgent, just platitudes and  worries and scandal.

My experience of the city and its skies feels like an omen. I can barely call out for help as I suffocate spiritually as well as  physically. A state of emergency has settled in around us all. I can  taste the ash. I can see the pink sun.

‚ÄúHow long before the birds start dropping from the sky?‚Äù

&#x200B;

My poem I wrote a few years ago:

&#x200B;

From the sky it rains ashes.

The ground is stripped to the soil.

No birds can be seen in the heavens.

Is this not what you wanted?

&#x200B;

The silence sweeps over piles of corpses.

The dawn welcomes another day.

A day with winds of fire and suns of ice.

In the middle of nowhere I lay.

&#x200B;

We have at last slaughtered each other.

We have battled ourselves to hell.

And now we can't seek comfort in a holy mother.

Mother nature was long ago poisoned.

&#x200B;

If we close our eyes the memories are still there.

Now it doesn‚Äôt matter how much we hate.

We are all of the same flesh and blood.

And no amount of love can repair what has been turned to cinders."

LIFE or DEATH. The thing is.. I don't do things half-heartedly. And I never gave life a full chance.

Choosing life: Truely being in the present. The only moment that ever exists. Deeply aware and present. Doing whatever the fuck my inner child always dreamt about doing. Being my most authentic self not the ego. Truely playing the game. The main character of this story. Hey I'm not talking about the made up toxic society game. I mean the game of life. Matrix, the simulation, the natures code we are all ingrained in. Spirituality, creation.. synchronisity. The magical part. The mind. The consciousness. The dimensions beyond 3D. Endless time, loop, future creating the past. Being the spirit. Life is a music show. There are low low notes and high notes. We came here for the ride, not the end. Let me try to fucking make it a banger then. I am cutting all the ropes, the one around my neck broke but the rest of them I am cutting by hand. No more chains. No more drowning, being tied down. R.A has entered the game. Player nr 1. Time to have fun. Fuck it.

/r/howtonotgiveafuck

Death: Will always be there after I have truely given life a chance. The reaper is my friend though.

SuicideWatch,fa5jz1s,t3_e7q0so,1575815734.0,"I would have said the same about myself not too long ago. The fuckup. Now let me ask? What makes someone ""useful"" and what makes someone ""brave""? What defines a fuckup or a success? We do. It is all made up concepts.

Why should we shoulder other peoples worry and pain? I am done feeling guilty because my mother can't hold her own fears together. I am done having to be what they want me to be, otherwise they will be in pain. Carrying the shame, the guilt, the expectations and the burden of others suffering. Why? You are not their broken mirror. Even if everyone deflects.

Maybe I'm not ""useful"". Maybe the most useful thing I will ever do is give support and love to others. To stand up and be my truest self. To fight for justice. Perhaps that will be enough. I know people like us, that stare in to the eyes of death constantly, to be walking around with all this pressure: We ARE brave. Not cowards. There are many fuckups leading up to success.

Now if you stop caring about everyone else for a moment and start caring about yourself deeply. Too seek within you what causes you pain.. get spiritual with it. I'm a beginner ""lightshadow worker"" so I won't be the best person to say exactly how you should do this but there are many lightworkers around. Or shadow workers.

I have lately gotten better without help since  there was never any help to be found anywhere near me. As much as I love  make-up and dressing up and that's not going to stop I still wish to  feel beautiful without it. I have definitely managed to stop feeling  like I look like a grotesque monster and there is progress towards  feeling almost pretty even on the bad days. So this is some of the keys  to how I have succeeded:

Focusing  on health, internal and going outwards help. Health is always pretty. To  glow. Meaning proper nutrition, vitamins, sleep, exercise and  meditation/destressing. Finding mental blocks and traumas and sorting  them out. Quitting social media and not brainwashing yourself with such stuff. <----

It sounds like you are addicted to social media, it's a very common problem nowadays. Then the biggest help will be breaking that addiction. You must know it is pretty much ALL fake as hell on social media and it will mess up your perception. Also it will give you the wrong idea of what actually matters. Likes, status, fake beauty and perfectly photoshopped faces are literally the least important thing in the world (especially right now), not gonna lie.

Seeing past the false bullshit charades and being  present in the real present. What truely matters. Giving yourself love,  attention and care.‚ù§Ô∏è

Lastly I  recommend spirituality, to go within and find your beautiful qualities  that you have that make you unique. It sounds so clich√© that whole ""it's  the inside that counts"" but it truely is the case. The universal God  agrees with me haha. The only thing that stands the test of time is our  soul, that's eternal and invaluable. You are loved. You ARE a beautiful  girl, always were. Find the eyes that can see it. I'm sure your eyes  have that spark. ü§ó"
BodyDysmorphia,f9f0nbc,t3_e4n24f,1575256470.0,"Very relateable, spot on. I have lately gotten better without help since there was never any help to be found anywhere near me. As much as I love make-up and dressing up and that's not going to stop I still wish to feel beautiful without it. I have definitely managed to stop feeling like I look like a grotesque monster and there is progress towards feeling almost pretty even on the bad days. So this is some of the keys to how I have succeeded:

Focusing on health, internal and going outwards help. Health is always pretty. To glow. Meaning proper nutrition, vitamins, sleep, exercise and meditation/destressing. Finding mental blocks and traumas and sorting them out. Quitting social media and not brainwashing yourself with such stuff. <----

enfj,f8wsdu3,t1_f8wjl9r,1574898635.0,"Hey friend, I can relate to that shook worldview feeling. I will try to put down in words for you some of my keys: 

Firstly, I have started listening to my intuition again, growing that connection with myself. I always had a feeling that they were narcissistic, a faint knowing or at times a pit in my stomache before anything even happened. The bell and red flags going off and I ignored them. Not anymore. They severely lack empathy, EQ and morals. <--- Biggest red flag.

Secondly, usually they can be spotted by them being loud or somehow in the centre of attention. Obsessed with money, status, admiration, looks, superficial stuff really. Selfish. Covert narcissists will be introverted though and play the victim card even more than a normal narcissist. Pity parties as manipulation. They wear masks. These masks slip every now and then. They lie a lot and don't think it's wrong to lie at all, but the truth always reveals itself in the end.

Thirdly, it helps to have had first hand experience, you have concrete examples of how they behave and have harmed you. ( r/NarcissisticAbuse is recommended.) Read up on all their tactics like gaslighting or love-bombing for example then start comparing it to your own experiences. Now this is when you will be reading them like a book in live action. I can spot manipulation easily like this while it's happening. I already could before hand to be honest but stayed anyway from thinking love could save them haha. Naive me.

Lastly, don't take any shit. Truely, stand up for yourself. You deserve real love. Sending much healing and support. ü§ó‚ù§

enfj,f8vg5zl,t3_e2cztx,1574868656.0,"Yeah, I'm a walking fucking magnet for the Narcissists. Insert middle-finger up for my latest ex. They swarm us like sharks. I finally learned how to spot them from a mile away now and also how to put up healthy boundaries. I have learned self-love and self respect. No longer will I be abused, drained, taken advantage of, lied to, demoralized, cheated on and shit on. No longer going to keep giving second chances to lying pieces of shits. Retaking my power, energy, positivity and strength as an empath ENFJ.üíú Sorry for the swearing. Healthy anger helps to cope.üòÇ

Edit: Okay so I know I have to forgive everything deeply to completely let it go and put it behind me for good. So I will now forgive him after I got the anger out. I understand and I hold no grudges in my heart. Forgiven. Now I release and let go so I can freely move in to the beautiful future, the unknown.üå∏"
aspergers,f8b5xpf,t3_dzzfas,1574428042.0,"I think like others have said, since our brain is differently wired it doesn't work the same on us somehow. The only way I have been able to release the depression and anxiety is actually to lose their false reality completely. Distance from the bullshit basically does wonders. I wasn't born with anxiety/depression, it is society that causes it. Like the suicide note I just read from a young guy, he basically killed himself because he couldn't work in society and didn't know how to fix it. Also, he was too disgusted by how people acted and how society was in general. I agree with that completely. So I recommend saying fuck you to the made up toxic society game, letting go of everyone elses opinions. The stupid norms. Just be you.. I mean.. there is probably way more things you can do too. Over all CBT didn't do shit for me though. Peace friend.üíú"

NarcissisticAbuse,f89l22n,t1_f89dbkl,1574374936.0,"That must be ass, living in the same building. D: It sucks, we just want to keep to ourselves and move on but they like to smear us. Guess they know they are the ones that messed up and they try to protect their own reputation by ruining the victims first? Hmm. Thankfully it wont work in the long run as the truth always comes out. Just by us being us, our character will be enough to expell the lies.

Haha that's the hilarious part isn't it. They will claim that we were the awful crazy one. üòÇ I laugh because it's actually tragic too. Oh well, at least we managed to dodge that bullet and like you say, she will find the truth later as well. Sending much support to you and I hope the situation gets better.üíú"
NarcissisticAbuse,f88rrus,t1_f88qkmw,1574359926.0,"They do make many choices. Many lies, many manipulation schemes, many that I still am not aware of. He is a few years older than me too so I can't claim he was acting like that from lack of experience. I keep wanting to make excuses because it hurts to know someone you gave your all to would do those things on purpose.

You too sound like a loving, compassionate and beautiful soul. We will heal together. This has showed how strong we can be indeed, when I ventilated what I went through people were shocked how resilient and patient I am. I also got scolded for being too forgiving haha. I have learned how to put up boundaries now. We will keep radiating and moving forward in the light.ü§óüß°

Edit: Learned self-love too. Sending much love to anyone that needs it."
NarcissisticAbuse,f88o83k,t1_f88nl3g,1574358062.0,"Thank you for this response friend. All of these responses is helping me breathe easier.‚ù§Ô∏è

I admit I know this is the truth.. I have been shining, creative, joyful and in peace on and off ever since he told his last lie to me and the weight was lifted off my chest when I broke it off. 

Then I find out he hasn't reflected at all on it.. and now I fucking hate that I am an Empath because my heart hurts for him. I should just forget it and leave him to drown in that fabricated, fake and vile world he made on his own but I want him to see the truth. To reflect, some sort of wake up call.

This is why I stayed so long too, despite my heart being crushed over and over, him lying and manipulating and doing whatever. I wanted to help him. It isn't healthy I know. Time to let go and fly in the sun."
NarcissisticAbuse,f88ltsr,t1_f88kuqu,1574356857.0,"""When they go low, we go high."" ‚ù§Ô∏è

I'm sorry that happened to you, shitty indeed. It's true that they will be the ones showing their true colours and exposing the truth in the end. As well as us staying true to ourselves and not involving ourselves in it. Stepping away. Definitely trying to use us as a puppet. Fuck those strings, I cut them off. Freedom, serenity, well-being. I will keep clinging to that and truely try to forget about him completely. I guess the hardest part is that I always seek the truth and these Narcissists need to face the truth in the mirror to get better. But I won't let myself care anymore about them getting better.. last time I got shit thrown in my face when I talked only the truth and tried to help haha."
NarcissisticAbuse,f88kfey,t1_f88jbcv,1574356195.0,"That is the sad part too.. I wish they could be put to the truth instead somehow. Even now my heart hurts for him because I know what you are saying is true. He is a bottomless pit that can't have genuine relationships with people. It's tragic.. and he will keep hurting people until he is healed somehow. Since they don't even face the truth that wont be a possibility though. I'm staying out of the drama, no contact and broke it off. Wish I could send him a wake up call without contacting haha. I thought breaking up would be the wake up call but the last time we talked made me realize that is the furthest from the truth. He threw horrible things at me instead. I won't make the same mistake again."
