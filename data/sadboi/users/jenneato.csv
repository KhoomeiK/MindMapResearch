NoStupidQuestions,fowbcuf,t3_g9nlna,1588116508.0,"The worst stories I‚Äôve heard have all involved roommates who never spoke to each other and just got progressively angrier at one another for their bad habits. You gotta address the shit that annoys you before it gets out of hand. Communicate! Over-communicate!

My first year at college I was lucky enough to choose my roommate (they usually try to honor this if you list each other as a preferred roommate), we‚Äôd been good friends since high school and it ended up working pretty well. 

That‚Äôs not to say we didn‚Äôt get pissed at each other sometimes/regularly. There‚Äôs always an adjustment period of learning your roommate‚Äôs habits, good and bad. We agreed to communicate openly about what bothered us though, like I‚Äôm a night owl and we agreed that lights would be off by a certain time so she could sleep, I‚Äôd ask her to clean the mac n cheese remnants out of my microwave after she used it, etc. Sometimes during high-stress periods when everyone was irritable (finals), I‚Äôd just pick up her stuff and throw it back on her side if it was in ‚Äúmy half‚Äù of the room. Mostly those items just consisted of socks/shoes and paper bits. My first year was tough tho and one or two nights I did have to cry while she was in the room and it was kinda awkward. 

It definitely helped to know that our living arrangement had an end date though.  We‚Äôre still good friends but have agreed not to room with each other again so the little annoyances don‚Äôt impede on our friendship. And in the end they usually do boil down to little things, as long as you don‚Äôt wait too long to address them.

EDIT: About the masturbation anxiety: on our last night rooming together we both admitted to having at some point whacked off while the other was asleep lmao"
