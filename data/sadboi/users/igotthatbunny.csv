Our bodies adjust to how much food we intake and eating three meals a day consistently may make it easier to continue that in the future as your body will be sending hunger signals more often. I know it’s hard but consistency helps a lot and can break the negative habits that having an ED creates. Also most college campuses have counseling centers free for students so I would recommend checking that out. You might be able to talk to someone who can help you keep on track or even find a support group on campus with others who are dealing with the same issues especially because transitioning into college can be a lot to handle.

The biggest thing that you have to do as a senior is a thesis, and I think most people turn down honors for that specific reason, especially if their major doesn’t require a thesis because then it is a lot of extra work in your last semesters. But it can look really great for grad school! Employers won’t really care either way though so I say if you are driven and like a challenge, or are planning to go to grad school do it, but otherwise I would skip it.

Buy only the typical quantities of the things you need because stocking up on months worth of goods just takes it away from other people and adds to the problem. I just coincidentally ran out of toilet paper during this crisis and now Joe Schmoe has enough rolls to last him 6 months and I can’t even get enough to let me a week and I’m forced to go in the public searching every day.

Whatcouldgowrong,fkfnyzn,t1_fkeg8gz,1584138664.0,"WHY WOULD YOU TRY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH A WOMAN ABOUT THIS TOPIC AND THEN SEND HER A DICK PIC TO ""HEAR HER REACTION DIRECTLY""

stop sexually harassing women WHAT THE FUCK

If she immediately feels like she is being sexually harassed it is because YOU'RE SEXUALLY HARASSING HER"
Whatcouldgowrong,fkfncmf,t1_fkegsud,1584138261.0,"You mean like how the guy in this post threatened to kill the girl who simply outed him for being a disgusting person? Does she deserve to die for calling someone out on their actions? Dude, just don't fucking send nude photos to people who don't want them, it's really just that easy."
Whatcouldgowrong,fkfn54h,t1_fke1meq,1584138125.0,A high sex drive does not give you a right to shove your dick into random girls' faces who do not want to see it. That is just sexual harassment and an inability to control yourself. Please see a therapist.
Whatcouldgowrong,fkfmw81,t1_fkf42yb,1584137967.0,if you don't send unsolicited nudes or dick pics then there is no problem. I think that is the moral of the story here.
Whatcouldgowrong,fkfmpf8,t1_fkf408f,1584137844.0,"Using that word is ignorant...you just admitted that it is offensive...you just said you were trying to attack me....pls get help

I feel sorry for your nephew, not because he has down syndrome but because he has such a jerk of an uncle."
Whatcouldgowrong,fket86v,t1_fkeal2n,1584120188.0,I mean if you did it when you were younger...there is a good chance you were distributing child pornography  which makes it even more disturbing
Whatcouldgowrong,fket3om,t1_fke71pp,1584120114.0,You have summed this up so perfectly thank you
Whatcouldgowrong,fkesytg,t1_fke58ko,1584120035.0,"Oh my goodness this is so freaking hilarious. Women, if you ever meet a man that gives off the slightest inkling that he is anything like this..RUN 

Also saying don’t use the r-word is not moral flexing it’s common decency because it is degrading and offensive to a group of people and the ones close to them."
Whatcouldgowrong,fke1q7p,t3_fhxpqd,1584102805.0,This post is revealing so many men who think the girl is in the wrong here and the guy really did nothing wrong and she should just ignore it/block him...men do better and for the love of god stop sending dick picks
Whatcouldgowrong,fke1hn8,t1_fkdzss2,1584102608.0,What the fuck lol this is so gross?? You don’t care that your mom saw that video?? And you yelled at her when she tried to alert you politely that something inappropriate was on the shared iCloud and you didn’t even care?? Your poor mother and entire family. To have no feeling of some embarrassment or remorse over something like this is so so so weird. Please don’t ever subject your innocent family to having to watch your gross homemade porn and stop using the r-word.
Whatcouldgowrong,fke0w09,t1_fkdz99s,1584102098.0,Well the goal seems to be to get him to stop doing this and sounds like it worked so I’d say she made the right choice !!! Also seeing some random strangers dick pop up on your phone is just as embarrassing and dehumanizing and she clearly took action by putting him on blast to stop this absolutely disgusting and offensive behavior that he was still trying to downplay as not being such.
EatingDisorders,fkdgsx7,t3_fhro9k,1584078232.0,"I just want to throw out there that even though you said your barely took the antidepressants, they can be a major cause for weight gain in some people so if you were taking them somewhat regularly that could have attributed to your weight gain and is totally normal and understandable. This weight can also be tricky to lose! Either way, I think your symptoms are a cause for concern and you should meet with a professional to discuss cultivating healthier thoughts and eating habits so you feel better! Self awareness is sometimes the hardest part so it’s good you recognize this now."

If a friend is truly a friend you wouldn’t really have any reservations about sleeping next to them. Everyone who said the right comparison is a straight woman sleeping next to a lesbian woman is correct, and I have many lesbian friends I would not care one bit about sharing a bed with, and often do after a late night out when someone doesn’t want to Uber home. You’re friends. That’s it. Your principle is homophobia in thinking just because Sam is attracted to your sex he can’t control himself and sleep in the same bed with you. Lots of toxic masculinity going on here too."

Ship them all somewhere else? Not an option. These people need help and this is a safe way to get them on the track to being healthy and productive in society once again!"

Trying to control your partner’s behaviors when they aren’t with you is teetering into abusive territory especially when you’re purposely trying to make her feel bad about enjoying one single day.

Also, hotels are full of germs too!!"
EatingDisorders,fiwt2f4,t3_faa2ke,1582801797.0,"I would say all of this is VERY concerning and you should speak with a doctor or counselor as soon as you can. If you are overweight it is good to lose weight, but there are safe and healthy ways to do so and I think you have fallen into patterns very outside of that healthy methodology, particularly with the self harm and punishment behaviors surrounding hunger and food. Please get help, down the line your body will thank you for treating it properly through your weight loss journey and you will develop healthy habits to lose weight and keep it off once you reach your goal weight!"
SyracuseU,fibwcfh,t1_fiblchx,1582331678.0,"You are truly a pathetic man and the most privileged of all who only has enough brainpower to say the same three sentences over and over again. Nothing much left to say but screw you dude, and one day you'll realize you are the problem. You don't know who I am, where I come from, where I have been and therefore have no ability to judge what percent of this world I fall in. I only hope one day you experience the other side and realize how very wrong you are. 

also just for good measure BERNIE 2020"
SyracuseU,fiajmpc,t1_fi9tn2o,1582302405.0,"I apologize but I can no long fathom having more of an argument or conversation with someone so ignorant and unaware of the world we live in. Everything you’ve said about me is just describing yourself and to put people down for their feelings is to invalidate the struggles they face, no matter how big or small, is inherently demeaning and it is clear you will stick to your beliefs. I don’t know who broke your spirit and told you the world is a cruel place you just have to accept and move on from, but I hope one day you realize you have the power to do more than chastise others and can make a difference yourself. You do not know me not my life or what it has taken for me to get where I am today. I think in politics in America the true definition of a sheltered life is choosing to do nothing because no matter what you are privileged enough that the outcome will not really affect you, and it is clear that is your life. Congrats."
