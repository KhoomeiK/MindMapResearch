childfree,fp8xo8j,t3_gbmc82,1588406645.0,"Thanks for sharing your story!

My experience is somewhat different...

I have two brothers, both of them have two children. My mother gives their families so much more of her attention, more financial support too - while she knows that my paycheck is much lower compared to my brothers and that my medical expenses are high, because of a chronic illness. It's not that I expect her to help me out financially, I just think it's a bit odd, this imbalance...

Also, whenever she calls me, the only thing she talks about is my brothers and their families. Not showing a lot of interest in my life, except from ""how are things at work"". She's their free babysitter and they never seem to express gratitude for this.

And in general, I do have the impression that the way that I care about my mother and other family members, goes deeper when I check in on them.

Kinda hurtful, but thank god for my friends, with them I do have valuable relationships."

TooAfraidToAsk,fmha09u,t1_fmg7pyc,1586071885.0,"Good to hear you started looking for a therapist! But yeah, it's a shitty time because of the strict face-to-face limitations.

Feelings of insecurity truly suck, can drag your mood so deep down and limit your functioning in daily life. It's really hard to overcome, but certainly not impossible, please never lose hope!

In my experience, learning to connect with others is a skill you can train.

For me, until my mid-20's, early 30's, I found it really hard to connect, keep friendships going. I like to have a lot of time and space for myself, not everyone can deal with that. But now I finally managed to build and maintain a good social network – mainly one-on-one contacts, feels more comfortable to me– and very good relations with my colleagues.

So even though this may feel & sound like science fiction for you, your social skills can improve, it will be a lot of trial and error, but you can grow!

You can definitely find support on reddit.

I'm not quite sure if this is the best sub for that? Maybe you can search for a sub that specifically focusses on the anxieties & insecurities you would like to work on?

Anyways, just find what feels most comfortable for you & kudos for reaching out here!

Take care."

These really bad depressive episodes are horrible, sucking all the energy out of your mind & body. 

Are there any mental health professionals you could contact? Or maybe send a message to friends / family, that feel safe enough to reach out to, even though you don't even feel the energy to pick up your phone to send a simple message. And maybe they could help you out a bit with paying your rent?

This is all so much easier said than done of course... 

&#x200B;

What helps me during times likes this, is trying to structure my days a little bit, even though even thinking about a finding structure feels impossible at first / the first few days / weeks /... Sleep hygiene is also an important one for me.

bipolar,flfpl6g,t3_fokdtk,1585113352.0,"Hi there!

Yes, these are such challenging times and I notice that many people I know irl with a mental illness / Asperger's seem to experience a worsening of symptoms. Please hang in there, there definitely is light at the end of this dark tunnel, even though it can be very hard to see and feel or even be invisible. We will get through this!

Ranting and ventilating is a good thing, us human beings need this in the best of times, in the worst of times...

Do you think you could maybe Facetime or Skype with your girlfriend? Seeing each other on a screen does give more ""emotional context"" compared to texting and calling.

I'm not in a relationship at the moment, but with my closest friends I stay in touch by sending little videos back and forth, talking about how we're feeling, about how our days look like. So not in real time like with Facetime etc, but still, it feels ""better"" than just texting, being able to see each other, for me it feels like a nicer and also easier way to stay updated and connected on a deeper level.

&#x200B;

Hang in there, I really hope you and your girlfriend will manage to connect again. Stay safe!"

I once had someone say to me ""I really want to experience mania""

bipolar,fl9efsi,t3_fnfiwy,1584951934.0,"For me, when a manic phase starts, I don't feel sleepy at all, I can keep going on very few hours of sleep. 

After a few days of this, I'll have a day or 2-4 without any sleep at all. After those days I do start feeling sleepy, desperately wanting to and trying to sleep, but I'm completely unable to. That's when the mania becomes unbearable and out of control and psychotic.

 I've ""only"" had two manic / psychotic episodes - in 2006 & 2016 - and both times I needed to be hospitalized to become somewhat stable enough to be safe at home. Sucks.

&#x200B;

I'm really scared to have another manic phase / psychosis, so the past few years I've been focussing on my sleeping schedule, as a lack of sleep triggers it for me. It has been challenging to continually stick to a ""better"" sleeping pattern, but since the end of 2018 it became easier to maintain it / stay ""disciplined"" and I notice now that it's very beneficial for me. Not that it ""solves"" my chronic depressive mood, but I do believe it makes me more resilient.

&#x200B;

Take care!"
bipolar,fl9d0y2,t3_fnf05e,1584950155.0,"Ugh, that sucks!

Would it be possible to call her office anyway? And when they don't return your call, phone them again? Insisting that you need your medication, because it's vital to maintain your mental health, that you really need to talk to your therapist to get this sorted out.

I truly don't get why she would want to change your medication regimen right now, there's better timing to discuss that, if it's even necessary.

I am glad to hear you're doing great! Especially during these scary times, it's extra challenging!

Really hope your refills will get sorted out asap!

I believe that if you have bad luck and grow up in an environment in which bad behaviour is not corrected, then it might evolve into horrific behaviour.

I was thinking again about this thread’s topic today, because it’s such an interesting discussion. I’m very firmly in the “traumatic childhood” camp.

Maybe it’s somewhat easier to “accept” that someone is “born evil”? It’s harder to “accept” that children can be so mistreated, by people who should be their protectors?

It could be a psychological defence mechanism?

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence\_mechanisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_mechanisms)

Mary Bell had a horrible childhood and there are also many red flags in the homes of Jon Venables & Robert Thompson.

In general, most people can’t even begin to imagine the harsh environments and traumatic experiences some children have to endure.

Some of these children will end up ok/ok-ish, others will be profoundly “damaged”. Some of these “damaged” children will end up doing horrible things, which can start to escalate from a very young age."
serialkillers,f55oirj,t3_dmmh3t,1572011105.0,"I believe abuse / abandonment / neglect / trauma / etc are often not visible or what most people would assume it would look like. 
Not all forms of abuse look like violent rape or hitting and screaming / not all abandonment looks like people swimming in their own dirt / not all neglect looks like not having enough food being available at home / etc
Oftentimes these things are much more subtle.

It’s also family secrets that stay in the closet, that create some form of tension in the family, like you can feel “something” uncomfortable and you don’t even know why. Until it bursts and the truth comes out. But even then it’s probably still invisible for most outsiders. 
These secrets can be harmless - mild - moderate - severe - extreme - gruesome.


I’m surprised how many times I read here that Ted Bundy had a “normal upbringing”. It definitely wasn’t, even if he claims the opposite.
When I read about his childhood, there’s some next level fucked up shit.


In my view a “normal” upbringing is very closely linked with attachment patterns.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory#Attachment_patterns
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory#Crime
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory

I believe when someone truly has a “normal” upbringing, which for me means being securely attached, they can’t turn into a serial killer. To become a serial killer, in my view, there’s always some form of severe, extreme or gruesome trauma in childhood."

Some secrets are just more gruesome than others. I see it as a differentiation between mild - moderate - severe - extreme trauma.

I don't believe anyone without some form of trauma, can turn into a serial killer. I believe most serial killers could be categorised in the severe or extreme category. A very small minority might be from the moderate category, but I'm hypothesising that these cases are very rare."
