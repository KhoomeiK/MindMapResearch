AskReddit,fkg7oww,t3_fi0g0q,1584152038.0,Do whatever you can that they love and take as many pictures and videos as possible. Don’t forget to also confort yourself and take care of yourself. Make sure they die happy and not alone if that is possible for you. Be kind to them and people around you and them to set a positive vibe too. I hope you are doing okay with your loved one. Best of wishes

crazygirls,fjgscpy,t1_fjfmn8k,1583334476.0,Nah it was a female celebrity sorta
crazygirls,fjez76i,t1_fjez3dj,1583280965.0,"Exactly, I hate seeing anyone abused because I’ve been through emotional abuse before so I’m glad there’s subreddits calling out EVERYONE"
AskReddit,fjdfffg,t3_fcroyz,1583252096.0,"Well. In short my dads basically a superhero to me. He’s a firefighter in a big city 3 hours from where I live. He does 9 24hr shifts per month and drives from 4am to make it to work by 7am. He’s always been so good at separating how hard work was so he can come home and play w/ my 3 younger siblings, cook dinner when my moms at work, do laundry etc,. I’m away at university, a little closer to his work than home and sometimes he even drives up after his shift to take me to get groceries. He’s a working man, but a family man at the same time and even though he’s always got 5million things he needs to do he doesn’t let them stop him from spending time with us. He treats all 6 of us and my mom like treasure. If I gave everyone his ig (not going to), you’d see pictures of him praising all of us, especially my little brother who plays guitar, he’s said himself that my brother “blows his mind everytime he plays something new” (he’s 10). My dad is just one of those special dads that I wish more kids had growing up like I did."
justneckbeardthings,fjb2yvt,t3_fchmgy,1583185462.0,Did he really have to say retarded tho??? Of all words??? Like cmon man it’s 2020
justneckbeardthings,fiabyaf,t1_fiabt0v,1582297813.0,"Even the worst ones gimme at least a little chuckle, but I wasn’t raised by my parents to be a bitch and I’m sure there’s lots of women on here and tinder that r the same way. Kindness isn’t something that should go out the window over a pickup line"
justneckbeardthings,fiabhft,t1_fi9xbfi,1582297521.0,"I agree, I get so many pickup lines on tinder. Pretty sure that’s the point, they’re supposed to be cringe. He def shouldn’t have said that but that girl could’ve certainly been a little nicer, or just unmatched/ignored him 🤷🏻‍♀️"
justneckbeardthings,fiab5k1,t3_f76lz9,1582297313.0,If he ever falls asleep in class you gotta draw the neckbeard on.. also the fact that your teacher is a Chad is honestly amazing lmfao I’m sure they’re in constant verbal war

BPD,fi8xuwf,t3_f6s99n,1582250882.0,"That second paragraph in the post is really relatable, I also have BPD and anxiety and get like that too, especially when I’m in lectures in my university or in a wide open space full of people. It never occurred to me that people notice that kind of stuff but at the same time I’ve always felt like a weirdo for it"
Nicegirls,fi8d7rx,t1_fi8c8p9,1582238035.0,"In your opinion yes, and mine is different. And so are other people’s because everyone is in fact raised with a different view of the world. So yes, that is your opinion, I stated mine. The question in this thread was can men be raped. Does your comment answer that question?"
niceguys,fi88zsk,t3_f6ykaz,1582235685.0,“You should match with me” “you are too stupid” totally sounds nice
AskReddit,fi7efj3,t1_fi7dxzv,1582219794.0,"I’m glad to hear all that, those exes always come back after ur doing okay, or they make subtle moves to make you try to come back. I can’t believe people these days"
AskReddit,fi7cp49,t1_fi7c249,1582218821.0,"I’m glad that you found new and true love, you’re ex sounds like a knob but when I think of my past relationship and such I try to look at it as if I was taught how to look for the red flags for next time! Take care, thanks again for sharing!!"
AskReddit,fi7cinj,t1_fi7c1ks,1582218723.0,Thank you!! You as well ❤️
AskReddit,fi7bxoj,t1_fi7bt29,1582218393.0,I’m glad you did so! The right person will make you feel like the most important and interesting person alive and never get bored of you!!
AskReddit,fi7bqxy,t1_fi7bm4v,1582218289.0,"I get that, I wish things had been different where you felt like you could’ve told someone and gotten justice, but you should also never have to talk about things you don’t want to simultaneously"
AskReddit,fi7bmbc,t1_fi7ag5p,1582218214.0,Did they ever tell you a reason for treating you that way? What about you exactly did they think was unimportant or uninteresting?? That’s horrible behaviour and I hope that whatever self worth was damaged in that relationship is repaired because everyone is very much interesting and even more so important!!
AskReddit,fi7bfmj,t1_fi7attj,1582218108.0,"My ex did a similar thing where we structured a break and decided to not see others and promised. I kept my promise, but my ex ended up staying over at a mutual friends house (who wasn’t exactly the cleanest or most respectful human being), and to this day even after months of being broken up, I still am pretty sure they cheated with said “friend”"
AskReddit,fi7b8mn,t1_fi7as0r,1582217998.0,"That’s so horrible, I don’t understand the sickness behind people that get off on forcing sexual acts on others. It would disgust me to know that someone performing an act on me was only doing so because I forced them. I hope you’re safe and sound and far as possible from that person. Out of curiosity (please don’t feel like you have to answer), did you ever tell his family or any law enforcement?"
AskReddit,fi7b1a5,t1_fi7amnw,1582217882.0,"That’s quite the ride you had, I had a similar relationship (however they did not ditch me in another country), and it feels good to see people getting out of that horseshit. I hope ur new relationship is much better!! Thank you for sharing your story as I know it is a very touchy and upsetting subject"
AskReddit,fi79e25,t1_fi799sw,1582216953.0,That is terrifying!! Did they ever tell you why or do you have a guess as to why they would do that?? What was the relationship like up until that point?
AskReddit,fi7981k,t1_fi7948m,1582216858.0,I’m sorry that you were made to feel lonely regardless of his situation. Relationships are the one place where you shouldn’t feel that way
AskReddit,fi792ob,t1_fi78z05,1582216773.0,Were you surprised by their coming out? And did they understand that they made you feel the way you did?
AskReddit,fi78wui,t1_fi78tcs,1582216681.0,That sounds really lonely :( did they cheat?
AskReddit,fi6r2b1,t1_fi6ckat,1582205137.0,"It’s still a bit different when it’s the girl, after all the fetus would b In her body. It’s not the exact same, but I get what you mean."

crazygirls,fi2bg2t,t1_fi2b5r7,1582075880.0,"Exactly, that’s why you call 911. If they wanna pretend to be suicidal, they can be treated like they r. My ex was like this and after once calling his mom to “check on him” and having called 911 he eventually stopped doing it because he didn’t get the attention and reaction that he wanted from me"

crazygirls,fhz5wnm,t3_f20ut2,1581991594.0,"If someone ever threatens that shit on you, you don’t even have to know the address just the first and last name and whatever else you can tell an operator... call 911. They need to grow the fuck up and learn what happens when you do that shit. The most police or an ambulance will do is check up on them, talk to them etc. And take them to a hospital if they need it. You won’t get charged for false calling if they didn’t hurt themselves because if they text you “I’m going to kill myself” you are somewhat obligated to believe them and in most cases it causes panic (unless the person pulls manipulation crap all the time). Don’t tell them you’re calling, just do it. Then ignore them and someone else who’s job it is to deal with it will, it’s not your job."
AskReddit,fhwimey,t3_f4q2zq,1581916984.0,"If your problems negatively alter your routine, for example you’re too anxious to go to work often, you’re too depressed to do things like shower and brush your teeth often, that’s a huge indication. However, as someone diagnosed with BPD, depression, and anxiety, and has been to therapy before... it’s very beneficial to everyone even if you don’t have problems. There is no bad enough or good enough, I think everyone can benefit from therapy. However, at the same time people really should seek a therapist if their daily routine is altered as I described above ^^ !"
