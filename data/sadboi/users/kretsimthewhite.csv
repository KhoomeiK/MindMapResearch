""How do can I ever eat/have sex/listen to music/watch a movie/exercise/laugh unless I'm high?""

I have not smoked pot in about two years or so but I am still building new habits.

HOWEVER, I am happy to report that all these things that I didn't think I could do, unless I was stoned, for the most part, are able to be done - sober.

I enjoy every single thing I listed at the beginning of my post. Sometimes I say to myself that it would might actually be more fun if I was stoned, but these are just fleeting thoughts.

Good luck."

stopdrinking,ezviqf4,t1_ezvilgn,1568179810.0,That's fine. Dont compare yourself to other people. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking. Ive drank and used on and off for the same reason. It just got worse and worse.
stopdrinking,ezvi6mr,t3_d2l31y,1568179164.0,"I ended up in a hospital. Been in hospital many many times. At age 31, and in the hospital again, I decided to give complete sobriety a chance. Not just for alcohol, but all drugs. Except psychiatric medication. I dont abuse my psych meds either. It got worse and worse and worse, and now I am just too scared to go back. Sometimes I feel like drinking again cause I take the power of choice and willpower that I have achieved in other aspects of my life, and I feel I can just moderate and not get too crazy again. One thing is for sure though, since I got sober in 2017, I have not ended up in the psych ward again. It's been almost two years and its directly correlated to me being clean and sober I think.

Good luck"
