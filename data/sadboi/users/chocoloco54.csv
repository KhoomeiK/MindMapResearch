Whichever guy you‚Äôre obsessed with isn‚Äôt thinking about you at all. It seems like you know this, but are still unable to stop thinking about him and ‚Äústalking‚Äù makes you feel connected to him. So in that way, you make him a part of your life, very indirectly. 

You need to break out of this pattern. There are professionals and resources that can help you, but nothing and nobody can do it for you. You have to practice making a clean break and moving on. 

Remind yourself that when you are watching another relationship like it‚Äôs a TV show, you are doing nothing to further your own life. Whoever these people are, they don‚Äôt matter to you, so screw them and stop giving them so much importance. 

When you have a relationship in your mind, they can‚Äôt hurt you. You need to practice having a relationship again with a real person, and if it ends, it‚Äôs over. There is no sequel on social media.
