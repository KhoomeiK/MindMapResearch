depression,ff3qpk7,t3_eqs4h8,1579546796.0,"For what it's worth I'm a mental health nurse with over 20 years experience. I've worked with perhaps thousands of individuals with a range of mental illnesses. My specialty is acute inpatients, and Intensive care. Meaning most severe ends of the broad spectrum of mental illnesses, varying from psychotic illnesses to acute adjustment disorders and personality disorders. I have always maintained that Depression and anxiety is among the most difficult illnesses to endure. Because people are fully aware of their reality and they know exactly how they would ideally like to feel which they perceive to be an impossible goal to achieve.  Hence feeling as though there is no light at the end of the tunnel. 

Depression is a idiosyncratic illness, in that everyone's experience feels so unique to them, and very isolated regardless of how many people are willing to help. 

On the bright side, I have seen some of the most remarkable recovery stories with depressed patients.  This often attached to Intrinsic self efficacy."
