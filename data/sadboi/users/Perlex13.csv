SuicideWatch,eteocb5,t1_etdf6g7,1562739834.0,Thank you for this comment I went off my meds for a few days. My mood stablelizers make me so nauseous and the  replacement leaves bumps all over my skin. I was wondering why the psych said that I should under no circumstances stop taking them but im still sad and I still want to die. Honestly whats the point in taking them then?

Ive been fasting for 3mo now and have lost over 50lbs. I rotate between 23:1 and water fasting for 2-3 days when I feel bloated. Black unsweetened coffe in the am just to kick start metabolism. If I feel sick I usually have a pinch of tajin(salty chilli spice you sprinkle on fruit) and pinch of sugar. That does the trick"

Makeup,et5jeq1,t3_c9tmdd,1562476068.0,You guys just use oil. Any oil really. I bought a pomade from jewelry box (worth 1or 2 bucks)  and its a bit dry or sometime I lose the caps but usually afte I'm done I put one or two drops of bio oil and let it SEI until next day or while I do my hair and make up. I mix the top layer wipe excess of side of container and it works like a charm. Not the best brand but it works

I am back home. Rooming with a sister that hates me. Having to rotate wheelchair and walker not able to do simple chores without becoming exhausted or feeling pain.

After my hip surgery... It was hard girl. Sleping sitting standing really there was no relief. Depression is here. I feel suicidle. I'll never be the same.

Drugs,erp04c8,t3_c2usth,1561094318.0,I recently had surgery and the day before I had a light meal at out bar district and drank water while my boyfriend got wasted. It was so much fun. You definitely can have fun sober. I'm 29 years old and the was the first time I truly had fun. I felt endaged and his drunk vibes wore off on me and I felt giggly ajd happy like the drunk I used to get when I. Would drink champagne. Your mind can control so many more things than the nerverves in our body. Also I have alot of pain from car accidebt and when I found out I was going to have surgery (I'm over weight ) I immediately cut sugar fried food  red meats. No ALCOHOL whatsoever. No pain meds whats so ever 2 week before surgery and lots of bottled water. Well 2 days ago I had outpatient surgery where my foot was amputade and my tendon was cut . I fought the anesthesia the whole time. I didn't take the opiods the prescribes and have been exersing when I feel pain and man its working !!!
