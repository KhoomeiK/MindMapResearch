Obamacare is a perfect example. Complete waste of time. 

The only thing that was any good from that entire bill, was simply making ""pre-existing conditions"" a protected class and forcing insurance companies to no longer be able to deny people coverage or raise coverage based on those. 

Anything else is just pointless. 

Getting a real bill that will do something and then getting people to vote nonretarded politicians into office who would then vote for said bill, THATS what needs to happen. 

But, I continue to assume that we need to let the country fail even more before people start paying attention. Trump has been helping move this along well.

PoliticalVideo,fqoa8u4,t1_fqo8z0j,1589510809.0,"I'm not entirely sold on that tax concept. 

I like the tax income at 4% and then don't tax anything under the poverty line and significantly over tax millionaires and up. 

I don't see any point in taxing the poor because they are already poor. It will literally save the country money just preventing them from being sicker. They show up to work more, they carry less disease around to not poor people, they get expensive long term illnesses cured sooner. Also in America we already have a law that says anyone who shows up to an Emergency room gets treated regardless of cost. So poor people essentially already have free healthcare, and legally can't take it away. So, just no point in even bothering to charge them. 

Then everyone else needs to pay so basically everyone just gets charged a 4% healthcare premium in the form of a tax and there are no deductables, copays, etc. Just a flat 4% tax. 

Then tax the shit out of millionaires and up. Now why do that? It's simple. Millionaires in this regard are people who make a million dollars a year. Not someone who happens to have a million dollar house. 

These people are making money from peoples labor and effort, Whether its Walmart or a giant corporation. These companies and business owners could simply pay everyone exactly enough money to have healthcare, but they don't. Literally anyone every employed at Walmart should have full health benefits immediately upon being hired. 

Walmart doesn't choose to do this. So, legally I'm forced to tax the shit out of them, and then provide the healthcare to their employees through a Medicare4All system.  

Then also pay for all the poor people with the rich people taxes. 

It's a pretty simple redistribution of wealth. Wealthy pay for themselves and the poor. Middle people pay for themselves. 

If you are ever unemployed or fall on hard times you still get free healthcare. Succeed and make millions, guess what time to pay it back for getting the opportunity to live in America."

Even California has budget issues with people moving there to take advantage of their programs. Half the countries homeless population moved to California. I think NY literally buses them there with free tickets. 

Canada just has better people, less shitty people, its not perfect, but with a much more well off population and a smaller population I could see it working there. But its tough in America.

The main point you raised about healthcare in Canada, is missed Healthcare in states. The issue Is that Canada is a country and states are states. You cannot just move to Canada because you feel like it. You have to immigrate. That concept of immigration is the sole reason all of Africa doesn’t just move to the United States. 

However, anyone can move to any state the want. So if one state institutes all inclusive Medicare4All, every poor person and person within expensive disease/condition is going to move there. There is literally nothing to stop them from overwhelming the state budgets. 

When it’s inacted Federally everyone is included and no one can just move here to US, (just like Canada) and overwhelm the system. 

The US has a huge budget and the ability to print money and have huge amounts of debt. States don’t have that power. So it’s a much more financially sound system to run Medicare nationally. 

Lastly the point of implementing Medicar4All is hopefully get enough democrats in Congress/senate/president to just ignore Texas and any other republicans and just get it passed, similar to Obamacare. 

Once they get access to it and see it’s helping them the citizens will appreciate it, regardless if Republicans told them it would ruin everything. 

Texans using the ACA have helps thousands with healthcare, even though they think Obamacare should still be repealed (it’s the same thing)."

I literally just said people aren't fighting UBI because its bad, theyre fighting it because attempting to implement it FIRST before Medicare4All, will result in a worse result for the country. (Bernie Sanders personally wanted a Federal Jobs gaurantee instead of UBI because he thinks people have the right to a job rather than a right to profits of a country, but many Bernie supporters are Pro-UBI.

Implement Medicare4All first, then Implement UBI.

I tried to explain the point of Priorities and apparently that means 
""fighting something"". 

State M4A, also doesn't make any sense. No one is trying to pass State level M4A because it ignores the entire point of unifying the entire country under ONE (not 50) health care system. Poor people would just move to that one state in DROVES, it would overwhelm the system and cause it to fail economically. States don't have the same economic - economies of scale, that THE Federal Government does.

If Americans and politicians pushed for UBI, then Republicans would no doubt try as hard as they can to make it the LOWEST possible amount per month AND argue that since the government is giving everyone money every month, that there shouldn't be Medicare anymore OR social security. 

Assuming that bastardized version of UBI gets passed, now everyone has to get health insurance from private companies, using some of that UBI, and the health insurance companies are going to jack up prices, offer shitty insurance and basically suck up people's UBI instead of people using it to stimulate the economy and live. 

IF Medicare4ALL gets passed FIRST, then the entire country finally has good comprehensive healthcare. 

THEN pass a UBI, ON TOP of Medicare4ALL.

The number one thing doctors don’t like about being doctors isn’t the pay, it’s dealing with 100’s of different insurance companies. Look it up. 

No one is saying the government will pay doctors less money. People are saying healthcare costs will go down. Why do YOU assume the only cost of health care is the doctors salary. Also you know there are different doctors and some doctors are overpaid and some are underpaid. But no one is saying to pay doctors minimum wage. Plenty of people will want to be doctors. 

Second, if your not making $100,000 plus, your taxes would be be paying for YOUR OWN healthcare, not other people’s. 

And yes rich people would be taxed more to pay for poor people, you know who are poor people, people who WORK for Walmart, they have jobs, and still don’t have health insurance or the money to afford health insurance. 

So, let’s just see how stupid you are. 

Your saying that right now poor people and jobless people for free/almost free health insurance. 

Right...

So, if they can already do that from the government. How the fuck do you think the government pays for that. With YOUR taxes. And my taxes and rich people taxes and tons of other people’s taxes. 

You are literally right now giving up your hard earned money to the government to pay for poor and jobless people’s healthcare.

Already, you’re already doing that. 

What you’re not getting is your own healthcare. So you’re already paying taxes and your not getting healthcare insurance for it.

You’d literally be getting more value for the taxes you pay if we had Medicare4All than you do now. 

You’re the one who is saying poor and jobless people can already get free healthcare so, why create Medicare4All???? The poor people are already using tax dollars for their health insurance. The part you hate is already the part you pay for."
PresidentialRaceMemes,fqc1etv,t1_fqb5z22,1589248133.0,"You just literally do not know enough about this to know what your talking about.

Everything you said is wrong. Like literally everything. 

There are more poor people than illegal immigrants, There ARENT good options for poor people’s healthcare, if the government was in charge of doctors salaries it would be a great investment, because guess what going to medical school is NOW FREE as part of the Medicare4All plan because that just removes the barrier to entry for doctors, now all smart people regardless of cost can go to medical school which means more doctors and doctors less obsessed with massive salaries to pay off massive debt. Doctors are still going to be paid pretty well. 

And it’s just stupid, what does “taxes, mean the money is intercepted from your pay check and then decided on for you because you can’t take care of yourself” even mean?? 

You do know that your and mine and every other person health insurance premium is take right out of my paycheck, it’s there on the paystub. ITS LITERALLY the same as a tax. AND I don’t get to make any choices my employer does, they pick the insurance company and the plans. 

I just wrote out like a two page comment all about how health insurance works and your learned literally nothing and somehow found even more ridiculous issues to argue about. 

It’s simple poor people with none or not good health insurance cost hospitals millions because there’s is a law that ERs have to treat anyone that’s comes in. This cost is transferred to everyone that is actually paying for private health insurance. Private health insurance companies don’t mind because it doesn’t affect their bottom line because their profit is based on a percentage, so they just raise premiums. Medicare works just fine and is the only thing holding down costs which would other wise skyrocket. Putting the whole country on Medicare and making medical school free would solve every insurance problem and actually SAVE people money and have BETTER healthcare overall."
PresidentialRaceMemes,fqb4hdn,t1_fqazcc3,1589230425.0,"Unfortunately, was missing quite a bit of information. 

So, first point. All public insurance companies (essential Medicare) pay the least amount of money for any and all medical services. They can because they are gigantic and if hospitals didn’t accept them as insurance they’d a huge section of their patients. 

Private insurance companies on the other hand most times pay the MOST for services. But are at the same time the most likely to deny claims to their clients, NOT to the doctors. 

Now WHY hospitals in general charge high prices in the first place is because there’s is a rule that anyone who visits a Emergency Room HAS to be treated. You show up with a gangrene foot, a gun shot wound, a heart attack, or a stab wound. The ER will treat you and THEN send you the bill. You know what happens when you send a bill to a poor person, or a homeless person who just had a $100,000 procedure done. NOTHING, they don’t pay the hospital jack shit, why?, they don’t have any money. 

So the hospital just adds it to their losses for the year. THEN they raise their rates to private health insurance because the people who pay private health insurance premiums have jobs (hence they have money). The private health insurance overcharging covers the costs to the hospital for all the unpaid ER visits (which are the most expensive visits).

Every time the hospital raises rates (because their costs/or losses went up) the private health insurance companies negotiate and agree to pay some more money. Then this private companies just charge their clients (you, me, anyone working with employer provided health insurance.) higher premiums to cover it. Guess what? We all just pay them because otherwise we’d lose our health insurance. 

So, what your missing isn’t that public health insurance companies ie Medicare are paying crazy rates, raising all our costs and it letting the little old business man running his private health insurance company lower their costs to be more competitive. It’s the LAW that forces hospitals to lose millions of dollars on treating poor people for free. 

Now, you know a simple way to solve the problem. Have the hospitals send the bill to the government and have them pay for it because the government is the one who made them treat all the poor people in the first place. But nope for some reason that doesn’t happen. 

But what’s interesting is that, if the government just gave all poor people health insurance for free, they could go to the normal doctor early like right when they felt bad, and get treatment for $400 instead of waiting for a disease or condition to get worse and end up costing the ER $100,000.

So, now all poor people and all old people get free healthcare that’s paid for by taxes. So, if everyone is working (and rich people) are paying taxes, so that old people and poor people can have free healthcare, then why don’t they also get free healthcare. That seems fair. 

Then the government healthcare just pays the most reasonable rates and FORCES hospitals and doctors AND drug companies to accept lower costs. 

So, costs go down, everyone gets healthcare, hospitals compete for patients because you can choose any hospital or doctor to go to, since all of them accept your health insurance (since there’s only one), and since everyone is going to the doctor early and we’re treating diseases early, we’re actually saving tons of money before diseases and conditions get REALLY expensive."

The director has explained that is the point of the film. 

But as a film, that I watched where there was a lot of suspense and character perspective, as in since we see the experience from the main characters perspective we don’t get wide ranging third person views/explainations of the administrative/physical/organizational layout of system (not specific mechanics of the platform) that runs the Prison, we don’t know what the main character doesn’t know. Everything he does is a risk and suspenful to us the viewer because we don’t know what’s down there. That’s suspense, hence my use of the word “mystery”. 

As in the phrase “it’s a mystery what’s down there?”

Is it water at the bottom? A sewer? A pile of dead bodies, a pile of old broken platforms, nothing as in it’s literally a bottomless pit, a never ending amount of floors and it’s turns out the movie is actually set in hell and the Platform Prison actually goes in forever? Like we don’t know it’s a mystery until the movie reveals these answers.

Part of the twist is we THINK we know how many levels there are and we reach the end and then BOOM another level, at that point it’s a new mystery because who knows how many more levels there are now?? 

Then we find out there’s a big empty room at the bottom. It’s perfectly clean even though people have been jumping off floors down to there, people piss and shit off the floor into the hole, etc.

Do people clean it, is there an exit? Etc

It isn’t had this whole build up and then for some reason he just gets off the platform and wonders off? 

That makes no sense, if you think your gonna die just stay on the platform and find out what happens if you ride back up, if you die for some reason you were gonna die anyway, but at least you (and the audience know, the answers to these mystery questions).

But that’s not the point of the writer/directors vision. He created an omage to class division and what people need to be willing to do to change it. 

The movie isn’t a movie with a plot and a beginning/middle/end. It’s a live action metaphor that shows only the relevant parts to make the metaphor and cuts out every single extra piece of information. Where the ending isn’t even necessary, so the writer, writes that He gets off the platform and has his imagined conversation and then walks off, because that’s more important than finding out what happens up top. He could have easily written He is too weak to get off and finally sees the bottom and then the elevator goes back up with him and the girl. 

But that wouldn’t help the metaphor make anymore sense or be more clear.

Like at the end the guy just walks off in this large room, is that just sealed off? Since it’s not part of the prison is it just maintenance space with elevator access?

Just that type of “how does this work”?

Or even when the elevator flies insanely fast back up to the top does the girl fly off into the ceiling or does it slow down nicely just like an elevator? 

I can believe in some version of the future they make a maglev type floating elevator platform, but after that every single “systematic” part of this “prison” makes no goddamn sense and the journey the protagonists go on to potentially learn its secrets and escape or “send a message”; are never learned or discovered other than there’s a lot of levels and big empty room at the bottom."

In that case, it’s just means people (someone; even at least just one person) know what’s going on and Don’t care, but also don’t go around telling all the staff and keep departments compartmentalized. 

Like know one wonders where people’s bodies disappear to? A guy goes in to “stop smoking” and he doesn’t tell his family and even if he did die, if someone at him, the “prison” can present a body back to them to bury cause it’s just bones or half a body or it just fell to the bottom of the pit and is never seen again? 

Someone knows, otherwise the whole system falls apart. Snowpiecers whole plot was there WAS a system and HOW the Admin kept the system running was Bad and created problems and class division. 

The lack of a system is the only way The Platform works as a prison at which the point that anyone questions it just realizes if it was an ounce more realistic it would competent fall apart. 

I can imagine a train that runs on nuclear power forever that needs tiny people to run parts that broke over a long time and has insects that grow eating the dead people and get turned into food bars. 

I can’t imagine a administration completely unaware of the size, budgets, organization, and who are the prisoners and keeping running a gigantic prison system building."

Be a wierd movie, make the plot not even make sense just to make a social commentary point, I don’t care, just actually write a movie.

Beginning, middle, end, plot structure etc. 

I don’t know, I consider it lazy writing to just go, we couldn’t come up with a real ending or one we could agree on or something and just decide to cut to credits and leave it up to the viewer to decide. 

If your a good writer your ending had a point to it it’s because then you beginning had a point and so did the middle etc. 

I’d have to consider the Platform an avant-gard Art Film to accept it was a “complete” movie, just a series of bold artistic scenes with hidden meaning and allegories in them, etc But not a “real movie”.

RedLetterMedia,fpaobq4,t1_fpa6nyq,1588452309.0,"I’m sorry I meant more the gist of how it works not the actual floating mechanics/engineering of the platform itself. 

As in “what happens if you ride down the platform to the bottom?” “what’s in that giant room at the bottom?” Why don’t people just constantly ride it back up to top? (other than it moving very quickly)

But if it moves so fast when it goes back up that you can jump on it, when it gets back to the top is the girl (or anyone) just going to fly up and go splat in the ceiling when it gets to the top in the room with the kitchen? 

The whole time I wondered if there was a giant incinerator at the bottom, because even when that one guy got cut in half no one at the top kitchen was wondering why is there blood and body parts all over this platform. It’s just supposed to be a jail not a cannibal farm. 

Logistics regarding the platform use more than the actual mechanics. The people/kitchen/administration have to know there are like 200+ levels, they have to know because there the ones that assign the people to the different floors. 

They actively move people around when they are knocked out around the building. They literally have a record of who is on which floor. So they are constantly away of half eaten people at the lower levels, that no one gets the food because it doesn’t reach that far down, etc.

Yet they keep sending the same amounts of food down. 

They clean up the cells and when they move people. The admin knows what’s happening. 

A big part of the “sending the message” was letting the admin in the kitchen know what was happening down in the platform like they didn’t know. 

They literally move people around randomly between the cells every month of something. If a person gets moved to 200 from 6 and then gets reassigned to 10,and they go to move them next month and there’s just a empty skeleton and the other 200 level person is there. They know that dude ate them. Because where he’d go, they’re supposed to move him to level 10??

The movie presents like the admin never goes into the platform and the only way to get the word out is to survive and get out and tell someone. Or some how get someone back to the top on the platform “to send a message”."

“The ones who likely have been dipping into the coke they confiscated from someone else and let them walk”

This sentence is not this sentence: “The cop was in the patrol car and the did some coke, then felt an uncontrollable urge to beat the shit out of someone so they pulled over when they saw a black person then started harrasing them and then when the black persons argued, the cop yelled out “Your resisting arrest”, and then used that as a “excuse” to beat the shit out of them”.

That isn’t what the Commenter said. 

The commenter said “Hey look,  a person who had a short temper, and is agitated easily, and jumps to being agressiveness quickly, you know like the symptoms associated with using coke. Huh, that would be a good hypothesis for why the cop is acting like they are. They could just be a douchebag and just be a really agressive asshole person. But the imagine if they were that person and had been doing some coke they confiscated all day on duty, they’d POTEnTiALLY be even more short tempered and aggressive and activated and their ability to think through things would be reduced.”

That’s what they said.

PublicFreakout,foyq02c,t1_foyojcu,1588177045.0,"Oh my god. You really don’t understand basic points. 

No one is saying the exact specific effect of coke is that you are going to fight people. 

No one who does anything always 100% ends up in a fight. It’s not a side effect or AN effect of any drug or substance. 

There are things called circumstances. Those circumstances affect the choices people make. Then the people and their mood and attitude affect those choices. Then the things people choose to ingest affect their mood and attitude which in turn affect their choices. 

You take the situation then apply things to it. Being a cop making a drug investigation and possible arrest is a situation.

Getting annoyed at a cashier at a store is a situation. 

Do you know how many times I’ve seen people almost start a physical fight a cashier because they were so pissed off at the situation, Way more than I’d hope humanity is comfortable with. 

Which is still a small percentage. 

Even those those events are a small percentage, having a different mind set while in those events change your actions and choices. 

Drugs effect your actions and choices. 

If your in a situation where you need to be chill and calm and be really patient and in agressive and open minded and deescalting and intuitive and etc etc etc. 

Don’t do coke. It will literally have the effect on you of the the opposite of those things.

Which.....leads...to...people...getting in more fights than they normally would, which ends up with people getting beat up.

That’s how statistics works, that’s how English works, and that’s how drugs work. 

...

It’s like your arguing that meth doesn’t cause people to scratch their skin. 

It doesn’t physically make every single person literally uncontrollably reach their hand up and scratch their skin. 

It induces many people to want to scratch their skin because of the physical and psychological effects of their drug.

Coke doesn’t by itself, make you, a person sitting on a couch inside chilling, WANT to go outside, find a person, and beat them up.

It also doesn’t make a cop WANT to beat up a person just because that person had some weed. 

What it does do, is make a person agitated and lowers their impulse control, shortens their temper, and makes them slightly paranoid. You can not argue that doesn’t happen, it’s literally the effect the drug has on the brain and the body.

The effect of those effects is that if a person, like a cop, is in a tense situation with a person who happens to have weed, and there is an argument over it, or the person is agitating the situation, the cop, regardless if the person had weed, meth, cotton candy, cookies, or heroine. They will mentally reach a point of thinking “yeah beating up this person is the thing to do”, faster and easier on coke, than if they weren’t on coke.

I literally mean Anywhere, as in the physical location which can result in be surrounded by different people. 

If it’s your basement and your friends are there, you can literally tell a joke about any topic. 

If you at a banquet hall and there are/can be various people or various backgrounds and moral opinions, the exact same worded jokes about the exact same topics from your basement ole session, may not go over well with various members of that crowd.

What the OP clarified is “Hey, your mom’s dead, hahahaha” isn’t a joke. It’s a statement that someone could laugh at because of the extreme offensiveness to it. But is not to any extent a “joke”. There is no set up, punch line, its not even necessarily particularly well worded observation that’s funny ala Jerry Seinfeld. 

Now someone in the comments actually said exactly what I think is the point: “My mom is dead and several of my friends mom’s are dead and one my friends mom’s abandoned them, so it’s like there dead; we do joke around about how our mom’s are dead and it makes us feel better”. 

They are telling a jokes about essentially the same topic but as jokes and at a place where people are going to get the jokes.

If her and her friends were at a coworkers mom’s funeral and telling dead mom jokes to each other, the other people at the funeral let alone the coworker may not find the topic of the jokes acceptable. 

So, in summary: Any topic can have a joke written/said about it, just as the OP said; whether anyone finds the joke acceptable/funny depends on where it’s said. Same joke, same words, same delivery. Change the location/audience suddenly the joke is bad and offensive.

You ever watch a movie and think “man whoever wrote this movie doesn’t have any idea how people normally talk or react to things” or “wow, that writer really doesn’t understand that character”.

I’ll do the same thing during an interaction with a person. If all of a sudden I realize that what that person is saying or how they are reacting would just come across as bad writing, then I consider it an episode (with BPD) or they must be having a bad day (with an average person). 

You start to notice a pattern that’s essentially “over acting”, which you notice when actors do it, your like wow they did not get the tone of that scene at all and then combine that with bad writing and you’ve got all you need to “sense” when a person/situation doesn’t feel appropriate for the tone/mood. 

Be aware do that and you immediately reduce the amount of times you mislabel someone “having an episode” as their actually reaction/opinion/emotion, and can stand firmly in resistance to a person actually “having an episode” or someone overreacting because they had a bad day at work and brought that emotion home with them."

Leading to the whole “women and children first”, “men must protect women”, “never hit a woman”. 

It’s one thing to want feel masculine/feminine as a woman want to wear pants or play sports or something, I’m just spitballing here. 

But it’s vast undertaking to switch from having internal desires to be protected to internal desires to be the protector, when physicality is considered. It’s essentially what boys go through as they develop into adult men.

Just something to consider for the full understanding of “feeling male”. As Uncle Ben said: “With great power, comes great responsibility”"

There are a few dumb people in every group. They don’t, however, reflect the entire group. They reflect their own group, the dumb people group. 

That’s who is annoying and stupid, dumb people. They’re everywhere.￼"
WhitePeopleTwitter,foaefx7,t1_fo9curb,1587645311.0,"Eugenics doesn’t apply to Darwinism. 

Eugenics is about people’s DNA or condition. 

Darwinism is about people’s actions. 

If you get drunk and jump of a roof into a pool and miss the pool, and die. That’s Darwinism. 

Now if their almost just alive, and the paramedics arrive. Don’t take them to the hospital. 

Simple. Stop helping stupid stay alive. Let them die."
WhitePeopleTwitter,foae3ue,t1_fo9hs7t,1587645169.0,"No stupid, dumb actions that get you injured and in need of medical assistance. 

Like protesting in the middle of a pandemic with no mask and getting sick from doing that. 

Accidentally drinking bleach.

Driving around without a set belt. 

Blatantly doing thing that you know will injure you and then disregarding any safety options you have available to you."

After watching some of the videos for these ""back to work/ back to living protests"" I firmly believe without better education your universal healthcare would be overwhelmed and bankrupt in about 10 days. Best healthcare system in the world can't treat 500000 people a week. Just not gunna happen."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fo92oqg,t1_fo91kv0,1587609180.0,"Fuck you. You missed the whole point that it’s not overloaded now. 

The other guy was saying it would be overloaded if we just started universal healthcare tommorow and It’d be bankrupt in 10 days. 

If we didn’t educate people BEFoRE we kicked off universal healthcare. 

I’m saying skip the education step and just don’t admit people that got injured or sick doing stupid shit. So they die and don’t overwhelm the system."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fo92c09,t1_fo91ujo,1587608958.0,"That’s why I’m saying that it only applies to hospitals and the “over run” situation. 

If you are a stupid person you get put on a list and you don’t get free unlimited healthcare. You get turned away and then hopefully die."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fo927pv,t1_fo91hod,1587608882.0,"Someone said those workers were essential. 

That’s their argument. Essential people should get paid for being essential or not show up to work. 

I’m not going to bother to show up to work if I’m paid shit wages. I’ll just get another job later it’s easy, there’s no skill to it. 

So, by assuming there’s just this unlimited supply of labor that will accept peanuts for wages, you’ve also created a work situation that consists of constant turn over and unreliability from the workers. 

His argument is just one piece do the puzzle of how employment wages should be figured out. 

So anyone else’s comments ARENT exaggerated in some extreme way. 

Their relevant and attempting to point out shit he missed on his way to his conclusion."

It’s where dumass people die from their own actions. 

The problem is we go to good at healthcare and we keep keeping the alive.

I’m just saying if you protest during a pandemic and you get sick and go to hospital, you get turned away, with the reason being listed as “dumass”. 

Then you die and the world is a better place."
