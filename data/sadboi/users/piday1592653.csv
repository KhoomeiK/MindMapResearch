I wasn’t drowsy, in fact I got up in the middle of the night, walked out the door for a bike ride Haha. But I also found Klonopin could both help me sleep and carry over the anti-anxiety properties to the next day which is why I started. 

I’m not a doctor but I can’t believe your psych prescribed so much. What was she thinking??!! Sounds like a xanax dose!"

I honestly don’t care how much I can or cannot lift, except everyone else at the gyms I go to seem to care more. Lots of unsolicited comments. I just wanna reduce anxiety and other issues unrelated to fitness... I do not count calories or macros or whatever at all either. 

I think everyone’s body is different, obviously. As for your issue, I’d go see a doc to see what you can do about it... its gonna drive you nuts if it hasn’t already!"

benzorecovery,fjyrvwt,t1_fjxmsg2,1583703263.0,"BTW I never realized 3mg Klonopin was a high dose until I started Reddit... The 1mg ativan is for anxiety during the day, it’s sublingual, and ya, probably doing nothing except placebo (my psych agreed) but hey, if it works... If only I could get actual placebo pills instead... !

My psych also never told me to NOT cold turkey on benzos... He should have right?"
benzorecovery,fjyqu0t,t3_ff8n1f,1583702611.0,"Is that standard for general surgery? 1mg Klonopin with some opiate probably? Because how much would they give a benzo tolerant person like me (klonopin 3mg/night and still takes 2-3 hours to sleep)... 1mg would do nothing for me. 

I was going to have an endoscopy. Not even major surgery, but my psych suggested I would need 4mg to get the same effect and told me to bring another 2mg with me. 

I always worry that if I have emergency surgery they won’t be able to sedate me!!! 

Why is it not recommended to take even 1mg of klonopin/benzo after being off benzos for so long after benzo dependance? Is it the effect of the benzo or the possibility of re-creating new dependance? Why would a benzo effect be different for someone who used to be dependant but no longer is and someone who has never taken it? (Sorry, thats a lot of questions.)"
benzorecovery,fjypp9n,t3_fff6nt,1583701916.0,You ok?
benzorecovery,fjypgyz,t1_fjxmsg2,1583701776.0,"Thank you so much for such a detailed response. I need to do this. It sounds like a massive undertaking right now so I’ll need a bit of time to wrap my head around it. Also I want to really see how my body reacts to withdrawal so I might cold turkey a day or so in order to find out how agressive I can be or how slow I need to take it. Benadryl is an option for me (or Gravol, similar molecule). My psychiatrist initially prescribed it to me because I wasn’t sleeping and let’s say making bad self destructive decisions so he prioritized the sleep and the longer acting benzo helped with anxiety the following day. I know 3mg is a lot of klonopin. For some reason, I have a very high natural tolerance to EVERYTHING. So even the first time I took any benzo or AD or anything of the kind it did nothing and my psych had to keep upping the doses... (also at my request. If I  gonna take it for a reason, at least it should work or else I’d rather take nothing...).

I’m not a big person I don’t know why I am unable to take regular doses of things. If ever I was recreationally addicted to anything it would be expensive!!!!! (so far just starbucks coffee)

Thanks for your help!"

AskDrugNerds,fjxbqww,t1_fjqx5p1,1583666574.0,"Ok I don’t have time now to address all your points but it seems like your issue is indeed maybe not fixable via nutrition and is drrug induced.... I guess this means you could ask for a stronger laxative or have another scan just to be sure there’s nothing physically blocking... or try drinking more of your calories (reduce amount of solid that needs to pass)... I grt it...choosing which issues and side effects to “live with” is not an easy decision, even when it feels like there is only one real option (live with constipation at least for now)...

If I were you, I’d go see doctor after doctor and ask for something that will help with this because it seems non-negotiable, and remind them its for a few years, you’ll re-evaluate the psych med choice/options when school is done.

Lastly: I’m 100 pounds but I DO strength train. No one knows how I maintain such muscle mass on so little protein. i measured around 9-10% body fat, thats what random people estimate also when they give me their uninvited opinions/comments. I can do 30lb weighted chinups and have done one rep at 50lbs, so I think I have decent strength and muscle mass. I can do 5 proper pushups with a 45lb plate on my back. I may not look big in plain clothes but no one messes with me in the gym!  Haha. Anyway.

It sounds like the constipation resolution may need medical help and some stress reduction... I hope it works, and that you gradute on to a long and fulfilling career! All the best!"
benzorecovery,fjqr3t8,t3_fee0k2,1583576900.0,"First, thanks for this... Great place to get advice. I see a psychiatrist so I can be better prepared to ask questions.

Benzo: 
-1mg Ativan sublingual/day as needed (3-4 times a week) 
-2-3mg Klonopin nightly
Exceptions: I have occasionally (3-4 times in the last year) overmedicated up to 6-7mg klonopin at a time with no side effects from the excess.

Time taken: 
This regimen: around one year consistantly
However: I have been taking benzos (Ativan + Klonopin) here and there when needed along with OTC sleeping aids for 4 years or so.

Other meds: 
-wellbutrin 450mg daily in the AM for 4 years
-Coffee caffeinated in the AM, decaf in PM. But caffeine doesn’t seem to do anything for me. Incan withdrawl from caffeine with no effects.
-Gravol (forget the chemical name but similar to Diphenhydramine) 50mg 2-3 times a week for nausea, been 4 months. (Not pregnant, unknown cause, maybe stomach irritation/ulcer


Female, 40s, 100lbs, muscular and lean

Nutrition: vegan, gluten free, no nuts (possible sensitivity)

Other:
-I have a naturally high tolerance to all kinds of meds. No meds I have taken have had any conclusive positive effect or adverse reaction. I’ve stopped cold turkey both wellbutrin and klonopin accidentally for 4-5 days with no adverse effects or reactions (otherwise I’d realise and have been back on it ASAP!).

-I think I’d have less of a withdrawal reaction than orhers, I think I metabolize meds ultra fast, maybe too fast.

-I have been athletic all my life. As hard and as often as I work out (even twice a day in the past), I am never sore or tired. No muscle pain/soreness EVER. No matter how hard I “try”. I’m not exagerating. I can do weighted chinups. My strength to weight ratio is high. I have broken bones and not known or felt no pain. I’ve been told I might have a high tolerance for pain.

Or am I just completely and utterly NUMB to everything in the world?"
benzorecovery,fjqlzaq,t1_fhhqt1v,1583574877.0,"Other than the suicidality, did you have/feel any other effects of the Cymbalta? Physical or mental? I also have no withdrawal effects from anything but at the same time, no effects of the drug. It’s basically like I wasted my money taking it, then even more to withdraw unnecessarily slowly from it! I have a high tolerance to everything, naturally. I think its genetic in my case. Not sure what other factors influence jt."
