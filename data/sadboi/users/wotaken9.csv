A five years old boy was found eyeless,  surrounded by candles. Apparently, his sister sliced off his penis and ate the organ. She confessed she did torture him, and it’s believed she did it as a part of a ritual. The strange part is she had a great relationship with the boy according to his family, she was used to take care of him and never showed any signs of violence. This happened this year, and I had never ever heard of anything like this.    They found nothing at her house at could indicate she had any interest in the occult and friends and family also never heard of anything suspicious from her.  They did find a burned cellphone that could indicate she had links to social networks about the occult and could have been influenced by people online, but from what I’ve heard nothing was found yet."
