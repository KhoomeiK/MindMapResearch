ptsd,etkpgr6,t1_etkod5f,1562904419.0,"Therapy- CBT is what worked best for me. I tried others but this was best. One of my favorite techniques. 

-Close you eyes. Imagine you’re in a theater with your therapist. 

-SIT down in the chairs and decide on an event (start small). 

-Have that scene play on the screen exactly as it happened. 

-Watch as a third party observer. 

-Now play the scene backwards.

-Now decide how you wish that even had happened if you had the option to make a change. (It is your choice on how drastic of a change).

-Watch the edited version of the scene. 

-Repeat until the scene ‘loses’ some of its potency. 



I did this for hours and hours. At first I only did it with my therapist, then I would do it at home as homework, then I started doing it by writing out scenes in my journal. Then I started being able to do it DURING flashbacks. Which allowed me to start to control them. It’s became almost like lucid dreams. Instead of falling into a flashback where I couldn’t feel or recognize where/when I was, it felt more like a movie. I could stop, pause, and notice that it could be edited. Then it lost its power.

ptsd,etkmslv,t1_etkluvm,1562902204.0,"Here’s what worked for me- it won’t work for everyone.



1. I found a therapist I loved. It took three different ones. I needed someone who pushed against my urge to pull back. I needed someone who would make me make eye contact (even if that meant she looked like a snake dancing around to make it with me). My therapist had experience with the time of trauma I had. She had experience with PTSD and with women. I’m a PHD student in family sciences so she knew her shit enough to just hand me research and also enough to tell me to shut up. 


2. I found a psychiatrist who listened to me about my meds. I went to them every six weeks and said, this isn’t working. When they said “do you feel better” and I couldn’t answer them because I didn’t know- I said that. And they took that as a no. So they changed what I was taking. In the end, the realized I needed i much higher dose of Zoloft that they expected - like 50 mg more than the highest possible dose. I told them about my nightmares- I didn’t bullshit. “Doctor, I can’t sleep bc when I close my eyes I scream” hey did you know there’s a med for nightmares, it’s off label. Prazosin- it’s a game changer.  I added a blood pressure med propranolol, now my heart doesn’t race. I stopped caring how many meds I was taking and started realizing my body needed help. I’m not saying everyone needs meds. I did. Maybe you do too. Since all this went down I’ve been diagnosed with Parkinson’s and found out I don’t have dopamine, of course I need SSRIs to keep my panic under control. 


3. Triggers- god triggers are the worst. This goes back to number 1. I had to have my therapist work with me on it. But I wrote them all down. Everyone. Every time I was triggered I’d write it down, and we’d discuss it in therapy. Then we’d replay the scene and discuss how I wish I had gone.  Then we did that with flashbacks


4.  Flashbacks. - I stopped stopping the flashbacks. This part was only under supervision. I used to do everything to stop them, of course i would. Then my therapist and I would induce them, and “roll the film” it almost allowed me to desensitize the scene. Now I’m able to experience the flashback without the emotion. I still get them sometimes but usually they happen, I use my grounding techniques, and I move through them and on with my day.

ptsd,etkluvm,t3_cbsb2l,1562901461.0,"Let tell you my story. 

I have Manic Depression - also called bipolar II - as well as PTSD (or not 😊). I had not been diagnosed with MD until after my suicide attempt. My trauma was a result of years of childhood abuse AND a nearly fatal car accident as a teen.  


I attempted suicide three times in 2017- as a result I was hospitalized, diagnosed with MD and PTSD, and put on mood stabilizers and an SSRI (Seroquil, Zoloft).  

After leaving the hospital I made a decision...
I was gonna listen to the doctors. I was gonna do it right this time- 
 
I had done this before. I had been in a place years ago where I had been hospitalized, where I had been in and out of therapy, on and off meds, kind of half assing my sessions and not doing my homework. I would sometimes write in my journal, I would sometimes refill my meds, you know the feeling. 

So this time, I was like fuck it, I’m going to try to do what they say. So I got out and I followed every line that they said. Every rule.

10 weeks. 10 weeks after getting out.
