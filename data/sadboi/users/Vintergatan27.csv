rapecounseling,foea8g1,t1_foe6qmk,1587699200.0,"I’m not forced to go to the parole hearings, and actually sometimes I just send in a written statement, but I think my presence makes an impact on the parole board so I try to go to hopefully ensure that he stays in prison for as long as possible. Even when I do attend, I send in a written statement rather than speaking because I read my statement out loud at his very first parole hearing and he laughed at me and it was really upsetting. In the state where he’s imprisoned written statements are secret and are only read by the members of the parole board. I don’t want him to know how affected I still am by what he did to me because I don’t think he would feel bad or anything. 

What usually happens at the parole hearings is that the board members ask him some questions. They’ve clearly already read through his files before the hearing because they generally ask some questions about things they already know about like his bad behavior in prison. Then he’s given a chance to speak freely if he wants. (At the first one he ranted about what a lying whore I was or whatever. At his most recent one he didn’t have anything to say). Then the victim is given the chance to speak last if they wish. The board deliberates for a few minutes and then they come back and announce if he’ll be granted a tentative release date or not. If he is, there are a number of things that have to happen for him to actually be released on parole. The release date would be like 6-9 months after the hearing. In my specific case the rapist would have to complete a sex offender treatment program (because even though he’s been in prison for the last 25 years where they could’ve been treating him all along, it’s actually just a couple months long program). He would have to set up a place to live and secure a way to get there. He’s asked to be paroled to another state where he’s from I guess, so he has to get permission from that state and to deal with whatever bureaucracy to arrange that. He has actually been granted tentative release dates a few times but always lost them because he refused to participate in the sex offender treatment program, or for some other reason. He was supposed to have a parole hearing last October and he refused to attend and apparently for now has decided to just serve the rest of his sentence (ends in 2025) so he won’t have to do the treatment program or deal with the rules of parole, he’ll just walk out of prison a totally free man. He’ll still be required to register as a sex offender, although I doubt he will."

I don’t think I’ll be able to begin to heal until he dies (hopefully before me) or does something that gets him locked up for life so I don’t have to fear him anymore.

rapecounseling,fobod67,t1_fo96k5i,1587661910.0,"Hi, I’m not the person you asked but I can answer some of these questions from my own experience. However, my case is different from many as I reported immediately after he released me and it was a violent stranger rape with a lot of physical evidence. (Also it was a long time ago so I might not remember the steps totally accurately). 

1. I called 911 and was taken to the hospital for a rape kit and care for injuries. I spoke to the police a few times in the five days I was in the hospital. They brought a photo lineup and I identified him. I don’t think I ever made a decision to “press charges”, it just sort of happened because the police showed up when I called 911. Also, technically, the decision to press charges isn’t up to the victim. The cops decide whether to investigate it or not, but if they think it’s a good case they pass it on to the prosecutor, and then the prosecutor can decide if they want to go forward. The prosecutor is the one who presses charges. So unfortunately even if you absolutely want to go forward with a case there’s no guarantee that anything will happen. 

2. He was arrested about a week after the rape. There was a super quick hearing (arraignment) to determine bail. He was denied and remained in jail through everything. I didn’t have to go to this, but I did just to observe because I wanted to know about everything that happened.

3. About two weeks after that I testified before the grand jury. The rapist and his lawyer weren’t allowed to be there, there’s no judge or anyone in the audience, it’s just a chance for the prosecutor to present the evidence and story to a group of average citizens who decide if it seems like a good case. They said yes and pushed it through for official prosecution. 

4. There were a number of quick hearings over the next few weeks/months, mostly just about specific legal stuff. Again I didn’t have to be there but I went anyway and just sat in the audience area. I never needed to testify or anything and I don’t think the rapist usually spoke either, it was just the lawyers talking with the judge. A trial date was set for about two months after the rape, but then it was pushed back another four months.

5. The day before the trial was supposed to begin the rapist accepted a plea bargain (the vast majority of criminal cases in the US end in a plea bargain rather than going to trial). So the trial was cancelled and a sentencing hearing was scheduled for a month later. 

6. The sentencing hearing was unfortunately like a mini-trial in my case and I ended up needing to testify unexpectedly because the rapist’s lawyer made some surprise false accusations about me being a prostitute so then I had to get on the stand to say I wasn’t, and then I had to answer questions from both the prosecutor and the defense attorney. (I don’t think this is typical). Luckily this tactic didn’t work out in his favor and the judge sentenced him to 30 years in prison. 

7. I did get the opportunity to watch the recordings of the rapist’s interviews with the police, but I’m pretty sure it was after all the other stuff was finished. 

8. No I didn’t consult with a private lawyer at any point. The case is always the state vs. the rapist, so your side is represented by the state prosecutor. A private lawyer wouldn’t be able to be involved in the case. I think a better option would be consulting RAINN (1-800-656-4673, or hotline.rainn.org) because they can offer support, information, and refer you to local resources."

I wasn’t snatched off the street, I was manipulated into giving someone a ride and then suddenly he punched me and took control. I did an AMA about my experience a while back if anyone wants to know more. 

Glad to hear that you’re doing well!"
UnresolvedMysteries,fc6w6rp,t1_fc6ld7y,1577491067.0,"I didn’t give ballet another chance, mainly because just two months after that murder I myself was kidnapped and (maybe) nearly murdered. So the rest of my life kind of came to a halt for a long time. I 100% believe that the man who did that to me has probably killed people in the past. Not necessarily like a traditional serial killer, but I learned during the court case that he was involved in drugs and gangs and stuff and he had a long criminal history including violent crimes so it wouldn’t surprise me at all if he’d offed someone during a drug deal gone wrong or something like that, and I think there’s a decent chance he’d murdered at least one girl/woman during a previous rape. It just didn’t feel like his first time, you know? He seemed so calm and confident when he was strangling me repeatedly."

I thought it was just a cultural difference at the time, but who knows."

A reputable, professional escort would have no reason to violate your privacy unless you did something bad to her.

So a lot of the not so positive talk about our experiences in the industry tend to happen in sex worker-only spaces.

rape,f76oypo,t3_dujkgz,1573432030.0,"You could ask in r/legaladvice too. I read the kidnapping statutes for Maryland and DC and I think what you went through would probably qualify as kidnapping, but it’s up to the prosecutor to decide what charges to bring. You don’t need to know exactly which crimes were committed to report, you just need to tell the cops what happened and they and the prosecutor will sort the rest out if they feel it’s a solid enough case to pursue."
rapecounseling,f5nccy8,t1_f5mvf54,1572298736.0,"It happened in early November and I reported immediately after he let me go. I picked his mugshot out in a lineup a day or two later and they got a warrant for his arrest and started looking for him right away. He was arrested about a week later I think. I testified before the grand jury in late November. The trial was scheduled for January, but got pushed back to May. A few days before the trial was supposed to start he took a plea bargain, and the sentencing hearing was scheduled for a month later. So about seven months all together. 

This was a long time ago and I don’t really remember much about talking to the cops. I guess my advice is to write down everything that you remember in as much detail as possible before meeting with the detective, because you’ll probably be nervous and might forget things in the moment. Maybe you’ve already done that with your victim statement. This is probably obvious, but dress nicely if you can. You want to look like a “good victim”. (Actually I just took a look at your post history and saw that you’ve moved away so maybe it’s a phone interview? But it still applies for any future meetings or court appearances). Don’t lie about anything even if it’s embarrassing or something that you’re afraid will make you look bad. Try to stay calm. I mean it’s probably fine if you get upset and cry, because that’s what they expect a victim to act like, but try not to seem angry or combative. I think a big part of whether they choose to go forward with a case is how much they think a jury will like and believe a victim. 

Good luck with everything!"

I had a victim advocate from the prosecutor’s office who helped me through the process and explained the court stuff and what would happen next, which was really helpful.

A: A patient must be a current Oregon resident. The law does not require a patient to have lived in Oregon for any minimum length of time. However, a patient must provide proof of residency to the attending physician. Forms of proof include, but are not limited to: an Oregon Driver License, a lease agreement or property ownership document showing that the patient rents or owns property in Oregon, an Oregon voter registration, or a recent Oregon tax return.
