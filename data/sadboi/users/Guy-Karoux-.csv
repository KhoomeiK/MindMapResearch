In CA prison ur race dictates who you run with on gen pop yard.  You stay w ur own race mainly Unless you are from a particular area of CA like Fresno, where almost all the gang members are bulldogs.  In my time working a gen pop yard everyone is ganged up, or at least runs w a group for protection.  I’ve seen white crips, Asian crips, black south siders, etc.  But everyone runs with some STG for protection     You can’t just do “easy time” out here and do ur own thing.  You won’t survive."

If they are white or Hispanic, they are good as dead when people find out.  They will kill them. I’ve seen it happen. Blacks will usually just beat them off the yard. 
On a SNY they will usually be okay, but some people won’t cell up w them and they will do get beat up from time to time."
