Well this one kid tripped on the top level and fell and knocked over like 4 desks as he fell down the three levels. Everyone laughed and he laughed it off but I could tell he was mortified. I still remember, Jose."

Petioles,f4a85zw,t3_djy5ex,1571490344.0,"As a heavy smoker with chronic anxiety, T breaks suck. Nausea 24/7 for days. Hot flashes. Sweating. Lots of sweating. Anxiety. But I do sometimes enjoy the clear-headedness that a T break brings and of course the tolerance, so I think it‚Äôs worth it. It sucks to feel like weed controls your life :/"
