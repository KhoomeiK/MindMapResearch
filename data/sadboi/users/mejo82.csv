Don‚Äôt let it take over!! I know that‚Äôs easier said than done, especially coming from someone who‚Äôs having an up day rather than down.

You‚Äôre a beautiful, strong woman and your mental health will help you be more relatable once in the nursing profession. Just keep on fighting back."

I might do a tiny bit of coke but will probably try to stay away from everything and just drink, as you did at EF. I have bad experiences with psychedelics so will definitely be staying away from them!

Did you ever do ket? A lot of my friends do it and I feel like it would probably just send me to sleep. I only ask out of curiosity as I said I will probably just drink.

Seriously thanks, it‚Äôs good to have a better insight on this, even if it is confirmation of what I thought would happen. :)"
