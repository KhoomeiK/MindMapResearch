Also, a lot of places are pushing back rent dates and making it illegal to evict someone on the grounds of them being unable to pay during the pandemic.

EatingDisorders,fjfrd4l,t3_fd3sdj,1583298215.0,"I’m also in my twenties and have been through a lot eating disorder wise. I lost around 5 years of my adolescence to my eating disorder. I truly believed in my darkest moments that it was going to kill me, I had even accepted it and almost wanted it to kill me because I felt so incredibly hopeless in my situation. I required so many services during my illness, ER visits, Inpatient, Outpatient, Social workers involved, feeding tubes, heart monitors,... Basically, I was told that it was a shame that I had gotten treatment so late by one of my many psychiatrists. After turning 18 for a while, I was cut off from the services that helped me stay alive during my teens. I relapsed but then I decided... it was time to recover. Nowadays, I won’t say I’m completely like I used to be. The shadow of your experiences always looms over you but I eat what I want and when I want. I don’t count calories. I don’t binge, restrict or purge. I don’t compare my body to every other girl in the room to see if I’m smaller. I don’t feel like I need to be a specific weight to be worthy, in fact I’m weight restored and I love my body so much more. Essentially, every few months I might notice I’m not eating enough because of stress and I’ll adjust and catch myself. I am cautious and make sure that I eat enough and am eating what I want but never do I restrict or feel like I am starving my body purposefully of nutrients. I am happy and I am recovered. Some days aren’t perfect but 95% of the time I am. I think one day you can get there."

femalefashionadvice,fbwzjtx,t3_eepoux,1577163913.0,"Honestly I go through my closet every few months, even if I choose not to get rid of anything it’s a good way to ensure that your closet is relevant, pleases you and doesn’t take up more space than it needs. I ask myself multiple things when purging items:

1- When was the last time you wore this?
If you live somewhere where the weather changes from cold winters to hot summers it is normal that you haven’t worn certain items. However, if the item you are looking at is never worn or you wear it so rarely you forget about it, it might be time to get rid of it.

2- Are you comfortable wearing this? 
We all suck in for a certain skirt, pair of pants or dress and I think to a certain extent it’s normal. However, do you avoid wearing this item because it causes you discomfort? Do you tell yourself all the time that you’ll wear it because it’s SO CUTE but when you put it on you can only wear it for so long without wanting to take it off? You should try and consider building a wardrobe that makes you feel confident and comfortable. Some items are just not meant to be, no matter how cute they look.

3- If you’re holding on to something just in case, why? Are you keep that dress you wore to your friend’s wedding because you might have another coming up, are you keeping that bikini because you want to work your way back to that beach bod or are you holding on to those joggers because you might need something to hold that extra weight in the winter? Some things just aren’t meant to be held on to. If you have goals for weight loss/ gain evaluate how achievable that goal is and whether or not this item will ACTUALLY be of use to you. Chances are, if you are looking to achieve a certain goal you’ll probably have to purchase new clothes eventually anyways. Some items of clothing also hold sentiment, is it something you wore when you were younger, something a passed relative has left you or anything of the sorts? It’s okay to keep things that hold sentimental value but going overboard is where you should draw the line.

4. (Not for everyone but I like to think of this) Is this something I can see myself wearing a few years down the line? 
Making sure your closet is sustainable and isn’t completely made up of cheap clothing can really help make your wardrobe last longer. That T-shirt that is starting to rip or those tights that are falling appart aren’t going to last very long and the next time you wear it might be the last time you wear it. Get rid of it."

AskReddit,f4551or,t3_djgwls,1571366249.0,"When I was a kid, I used to sleep over at my best-friends house pretty often. The house was brand new, just built but there was always creepy stuff going on there. Here are a couple of stories:
- One night when we were sleeping in the basement and her parents were sleeping upstairs (middle floor vacant) we kept hearing footsteps and chairs. We thought it was her parents being loud so she went up the stairs to ask to be more quiet as we were trying to sleep. Her mother had come down the stairs to tell us to be quiet and to stop dragging the chairs. The lights were off on the middle floor and they don’t have any pets. There was nobody there.
- One day we were babysitting her little sister and we started hearing noise on the middle floor again. Her parents had left not too long ago and consider what had happened a few weeks prior we knew it couldn’t be them. We told her little sister to stay downstairs, I grabbed a hammer and she grabbed (not her smartest idea but wtv) a small guitar to protect herself. We slowly crept our way up the steps and we could still hear footsteps. When we made it to the middle floor nobody was there. When we made our way to the steps that lead upstairs we saw a shadow run by and we basically just screamed and ran back down to the basement (I was like 12 give me a break) where we tried to lock ourselves in and called her parents. There was never anyone there. I don’t go to her house anymore."
EatingDisorders,f4000fh,t3_dipbzk,1571281051.0,"As a someone who is 90% recovered from my ED, I was especially and sometimes still am sensitive to other people’s weight. It’s difficult going from the slimmest person in the room to completely average/ small but not SUPER small. At one point, I even dated a girl and had to be honest with her... I couldn’t be with her as she was far too underweight for me to be in a healthy relationship. Even the brief relationship messed up my mental health for months (however I do believe this girl had an eating disorder unlike you). 

This might sound sad but I don’t think with the way your friend is acting your friendship will last... not until she decides that her health and happiness is more important than her weight and how she compares to others.

You are nowhere near at fault here and you don’t have to bend your eating habits to hers. You don’t need to go get your blood drawn, you don’t need to justify what you eat and if she doesn’t understand that then she isn’t considering your feelings in all this. Unfortunately, anorexia has a way of making people selfish (myself included in this). Relationships with friends and family incredibly suffer but ones the person actually dedicates themselves to recovery those relationships can be rekindled and sometimes come out stronger.

You need to talk with her and discuss why she’s focused on you and not herself. If she can’t be around you to recover, she should consider moving back in with her parents.

You’re a good friend to her."

AskReddit,f3yl2wt,t3_diui5v,1571255573.0,"I disagree with them. For those who are unaware, her parents are accused of throwing her in the spotlight and sort of forcing her to protest for the environment. People think that they are using her  autism as a way of manipulating her.

She is 16, she is eloquent and her autism is what drives her focus to maintain the environment. Although her parents are famous, nobody is forcing her to share the spotlight. Nobody forced her to start protesting and it is her choice to go around the world to convey her message. Her parents have supported her by going vegan, they have supported her past struggles and they are providing her with necessary people to aid her journey.

I truly think people who think she is being abused are not attuned with the message our youth is trying to convey. “Children” are not silent, they have thoughts and dreams and the idea that a girl can’t be responsible for what is going on is ridiculous. 

Love Greta, hate the haters."
