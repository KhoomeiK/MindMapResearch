BipolarSOs,fq5vvqg,t1_fq56rmn,1589118831.0,"If he made you feel loved the whole time and was kind, loving and caring to you, and then it changed abruptly out of nowhere then his cold un empathetic statement about I can‚Äôt love you was the Bi-Polar talking, he loved you before and had no issues up until then right? His Bi-Polar kicked in with the Ghosting symptoms and he is looking for a external circumstance to explain why he got his feelings shut off. Our feelings towards our partner literally just get turned off out of nowhere like a light switch and if we are not self aware of it then we go and do something stupid like break off a good thing. I‚Äôve learned that these feelings are complete BS from the illness, and the best thing to do is to do is to reassure your partner while things are good that this could happen and that I will not trust the impulses or feelings that tell me to run away and make a logical decision to never break up with my partner. Since it is going to happen with no matter who I am with, it‚Äôs completely irrational, cruel and stupid on my part to run away from a good thing over and over from person to person. It‚Äôs pretty much going to always have to be the SO who is going to make that decision for our relationship. I‚Äôm just not going to be able to trust my brain with making this decision during symptoms. I also do my best to fake it as much as I can in order to not frighten them while it‚Äôs disappeared and wait for the feelings to return, for me anyway, they always do. If we don‚Äôt discuss this scenario ahead of time and go over my plan to follow logic during this period I don‚Äôt know how I could be a good partner. We have to become extremely self aware of our feelings and be able to differentiate between the real us that‚Äôs loving, compassionate and happy and the symptoms that can randomly make the true feelings go away and confuse the hell out of us. For a Bi-Polar person it‚Äôs best to just be governed by logic with our standing by our partners no matter what and make it so that they are the ones to break it off. I know that it‚Äôs completely contradicting to a normal persons follow the heart thing, but we just shouldn‚Äôt rely on that thinking when it comes to us.

BipolarSOs,fq09rqy,t3_gevfun,1589029189.0,I think that we get a huge dump of oxytocin we first meet someone who is compatible and get overwhelmed with the infatuation and completely fall for the person hard and fast. The new relationship can throw us into mania and then we get confused. It is recommended to us that we note the fact that this will happen and make a decision ahead of time to not trust the feelings that tell us to leave and make a logical decision to never break up with a partner during mania because the feelings are just coming from the sickness. With that being said most of aren‚Äôt that self aware. We are even supposed to up our meds when we get into a relationship in order to try and curb it.

BipolarSOs,fojbweo,t1_foi7w2j,1587816131.0,"Thank you so much for your kind words, I‚Äôm sorry that you‚Äôre BPSO is pushing you away right now, the depressive episodes are so dark. He‚Äôs feeling extreme guilt, hopeless about the future, and an extreme sense of worthlessness. He truly feels that he doesn‚Äôt deserve a person like you, and feels that you deserve so much better than him and he‚Äôs doing you a favor by ignoring you. The dark times convince us that things are never going to get better and the self hatred is so powerful during these times. 

When Bi-Polar people get to meet one another, we can talk to each other straight up, we know that we cannot BS each other because we know each other‚Äôs truths. It‚Äôs the strangest thing, but we actually pretty much already love and stand by each other by default from the moment we meet. I would maybe let him know that you have invested the time and energy to educate yourself on the illness, and spoke directly with his same kind to understand what he‚Äôs going through, let him know that we helped you understand directly. Tell him that you know his depression is going to go away and that his life force will be given back to him at some point. 

He will not be able to deny this truth. He knows deep down that the illness will never let him stay in one place forever, however his mind is so convincing that it will right now. He has such low energy and is feeling so horrible that just taking a shower or picking up a phone is a horribly monumental task right now. Just assure him that it‚Äôs going to get better and that you are willing to support him through this, just show him love and support. If he knows that you are educated it will make him feel more comfortable and he might be willing to trust opening up to you and stop pushing you away. 

We feel like nobody is able to understand us and we don‚Äôt know how to explain what we go through and the only way to protect the other person is to get them to want to leave us. 

That‚Äôs all I ever wanted, but I‚Äôve never had the chance to have a partner willing to learn about the illness and how to separate the real me from the symptoms.

She‚Äôs either in too much of her own mental pain to be able to empathize with your emotional feelings or she‚Äôs could be in a mixed episode. The cruelty coupled with the being extra social with her friends sounds like a mixed episode, which are the absolute worst of the main three different kinds. She‚Äôs only got cognitive empathy right now, the other kind of empathy that you need from her is unfortunately gone right now. It has been turned off by the illness. If you have your heart exposed to it right now she‚Äôs going to crush you without even knowing it. Subconsciously she cares about you and is pushing you away for your own good in her mind.

I know that it must be incredibly hard and painful. Just remember that as reel as it feels it‚Äôs not, and so few of us are able to be self aware like she is. The great news is that she knows herself that she can‚Äôt trust her feelings and is trying to distance herself from you until it comes back.

If she stays medicated and willing to follow the management program, she will be good. 

1. Take the meds every day 
2. Keep her dr informed of any changes in symptoms 
3. Get a good nights sleep according to a schedule IE, go to bed every night and waking up at the same time. 
4. Switch to a healthy diet no junk food! Lay off the caffeine and sugar. Eat fruit instead. 
5. Exercise every single day! 
6. Take time to herself to reflect, and be mindful (they taught her all these skills at the hospital)
7. No drugs or alcohol. 

Then you won‚Äôt have to awfulize thinking that your going to have to deal with episodes over and over in the future. In fact if she does all these things, she will be happier, more grounded and in much better physical shape than most and will live a normal healthy life. She will still have some ups and downs but they will be minimal and not life upheaving, more like a sad day here and there in bed or a little happier than usual from time to time. 

This illness is a 7 day per week job, no weekend breaks to sleep in or binge drink just because it the weekend. This illness is no joke and will take a lifelong commitment to manage successfully. If she‚Äôs willing to do this for herself and you then give her a chance and you might be surprised."

BipolarSOs,fo1ctbo,t3_g54sc5,1587430506.0,"It could be a mixed episode and I‚Äôm really sorry that you are going through this, unfortunately it‚Äôs common for the illness to trick us and completely change our perception and temporarily remove our feelings for our partners and hinder our non cognitive empathy. She‚Äôs going to have to come to the realization that her feelings changing so rapidly are part of the illness and she is going to regret it and feel terrible about how she‚Äôs been treating you when this episode wares off more than likely. Watch this video for a great explanation for what‚Äôs probably happening and protect yourself by distancing yourself from her and help yourself heal from the abuse. If she comes back then demand that she learns about this part of the illness and set up a plan ahead of time if it happens again. https://youtu.be/McFHjosP54E"

I can‚Äôt get to a gun, don‚Äôt have a knife anywhere sharp enough, no rope or anything to tie it too, and no drugs to od on. This shit is hard. Lol"

It‚Äôs so funny because I‚Äôve spent hours upon hours on the r suicide boards talking people out of killing them selves and now here I am. This illness is never going to stop fucking my life up and I‚Äôm just over it. I‚Äôm a fair weather liver of life, just don‚Äôt have any desire to keep fighting. This illness has cost me everything that I cared about, no one forgives the symptoms of this disease.

bipolar,fo06f9f,t3_g4v3f5,1587406897.0,This lockdown in combination with going through a divorce is destroying me. Had to leave work early today just to come home and lay in the fetal position. I took a break from researching different ways to kill myself to surf Reddit for a while. I‚Äôm so tired of being depressed. Lost all my coping mechanisms that were working to this shutdown. The corona virus is killing people without even infecting them. About to call the ex wife and tell her to stop worrying about paying her divorce attorney because she‚Äôs going to be a widow instead.

Got thrown into a manic episode every time only to come crawling back to the Lamictal."
bipolar,fnwaw4u,t3_g4980u,1587314865.0,"Create a routine or get beaten into submission by it. If you want to do it perfectly by the book, here‚Äôs the best known way to tame this beast.

1. Go to sleep at a decent hour and wake up at the same time every morning. 

2. Eat as medicine and not pleasure. Work fresh fruit into your daily diet. I like to blend up frozen fruits into a smoothie with hemp seeds for vital omega 3 and 6‚Äôs. Try to stay away from junk food and limit your refined sugar intake. 

3. Take your meds at the same time every day religiously. 

4. Exercise to get cardio every single day, and while you‚Äôre at it might as well add in a little weight lifting. 

5. Don‚Äôt do any drugs or weed, and lay off the alcohol. 

Do these 5 things as if your life depends on it and you will be the person who normal people are going to envy because you are going to look and feel great."
bipolar,fnw99dw,t3_g4a2e7,1587313964.0,"I‚Äôm sorry that you are going through this, all I can say is that your not alone and it will eventually get better. All we can do after we lash out by accident  is apologize, and when we need help is to ask. If the other person is in the dark about our symptoms then they will not be able to understand. I hope that your boyfriend at least knows that you are Bi-Polar and is willing to at least spend a little time on YouTube or something to learn about it. After my last relationship fail, I will never again be with someone who isn‚Äôt fully educated on our condition and the symptoms. I‚Äôm convinced that if they don‚Äôt understand our illness it will never work. 

Don‚Äôt beat yourself up over it, it‚Äôs a hardcore illness and can make us do and say things we are going to regret, I know that it‚Äôs hard to come out of the Bi-Polar closet, and I hid it from everyone in my life up until I got admitted into the hospital and everyone found out. It‚Äôs kinda a relief now knowing that it‚Äôs out in the open and the people still in my life have at least tried to become more understanding when I mess up or am feeling down. 

I‚Äôm in a bad place myself right now, but I figured out that exercise and some good music to ware out the body is a good go to for helping us feel better. This am I just started walking to my music until I got nice and worn down and it really dose help ease the symptoms even better than meds IMO."

BipolarSOs,fnvqcy7,t1_fnsz8bn,1587301912.0,"Imagine just going about your day and then out of nowhere your entire life force just disappears and you become dead inside. Nothing you do or anything good that happens is capable of bringing you pleasure, it wouldn‚Äôt matter if you just won the lottery, you will be unable to feel anything good from it. The whole world becomes dull and you become desensitized from all good things and life experiences. Your body becomes weak and no matter how much rest you get, everything feels like a monumental task, even talking to another human being becomes this horrible and exhausting exercise. There‚Äôs this loneliness that engulfs you, along with this sense of hopelessness for the present and future. Imagine being handed your favorite foods, yet they have become completely tasteless. Your mind then becomes distressed, it desperately wants to fix its situation and escape from this situation, unfortunately there‚Äôs no escape, no fix, until it realizes that there is in fact only one true way for escape, and that‚Äôs when you commit suicide."

BipolarReddit,fmmy3bt,t3_fw4bmc,1586214287.0,"I am getting a divorce right now that sounds like what you are going through, my wife became in tolerant to any signs of my illness after a head trauma, before that she didn‚Äôt get upset as much but afterwards she just became one of those spouses who couldn‚Äôt handle it and no matter how hard I tried or how much progress I made, she expected me to never have a slip up, ever. I had to accept that never showing symptoms ever was just impossible and not realistic. The medications aren‚Äôt going to fix it 100% no matter how good they are. If he‚Äôs not willing to accept your faults then he‚Äôs not the right person who deserves all the best things we have to offer. Find a guy who is willing to accept the fact that sometimes you are going to have some mood swings and will be supportive of you instead. Unfortunately there are a ton of spouses who aren‚Äôt willing to accept that it‚Äôs an illness and will always insist on it being a character flaw. 

With all that being said, Lamictal is great, I had bad luck with the welbutron, it gives you really bad dreams. I‚Äôm digging my seroquel and lamictal combo with some Busbar for anxiety though."
BipolarSOs,fmhvf4p,t3_fvdljj,1586094705.0,"We aren‚Äôt hot and cold all the time, can go years in with it in repression by following the plan and shorten our symptoms by quite a bit with our health regiment, however you guys aren‚Äôt getting a fair shake right now. We have all lost a lot of our coping mechanisms due to the current situation with the world and he‚Äôs probably up against the wall trying to fight off the depression with the rest of us right now just trying to hang on. He certainly isn‚Äôt going to want to expose a new relationship to his depression. 

We lost the Gyms, it‚Äôs hard to get enough time outdoors for the vital sun, we lost our ability to fend it off with many activities, social isolation is horrible for us and causes depression, and to top it off he‚Äôs going through the stress of a new job and not wanting to mess up a good thing with you right now. 

Unfortunately he doesn‚Äôt stand a chance. 

This storm is going to kill off a lot of us, I was doing everything right and by the book and now due to all of these coping mechanisms being taken away, I no longer even have the strength to take phone calls from my best of friends or family. Being trapped inside with social isolation and the ability to be active is a true death sentence for our normal happy selves, I was doing and feeling great before this thing and now it‚Äôs worn me down so much it‚Äôs so hard for me to even get out of bed, take a shower or go to work. Just doing that is so painfully exhausting when the depression comes. If he‚Äôs following the self care regiment he‚Äôs going to be able to come back out of it once things get somewhat back to normal and be the guy who you fell for. I don‚Äôt know how any of us can be doing well right now. 

Please don‚Äôt take his withdrawn and neediness right now too judgmental, if you like him just hang in there with him until the cards aren‚Äôt so stacked against us. This is hard as hell right now."

BipolarSOs,fm9ru8b,t1_fm9nzij,1585875145.0,"She could be in a mixed episode, that‚Äôs when you have both the up and down at the same exact time. Look up bipolar mixed episodes on you tube. First and foremost protect your own emotional well being. Don‚Äôt let her mind fuck you. No matter who she dates, I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs a young Brad pit she is going to have her attraction to them come and go in and out like waves on the beach. We can‚Äôt control it, I used to date a solid 10 and had to deal with my just losing my attraction an interest in her, and it would just come back out of nowhere. It‚Äôs hard to explain but that‚Äôs how it goes. I‚Äôm older and much more mindful of my illness now so I understand what‚Äôs going on and it sounds like she‚Äôs still learning herself, at least she‚Äôs recognized that she has a pattern. 

Be brave, say fuck it and keep the texts, just don‚Äôt become instantly available and the ‚Äúgood guy‚Äù be nice but develop a little mystery about how you are spending your time, go out with other friends, maybe hang out with some other girls if you can. Don‚Äôt turn into her friend. Act like you can take it or leave it and do your thing without her. Make her realize that if she wants a texting buddy it‚Äôs got to be her boyfriend and not just the nice guy friend willing to put up with the BS and get no reward for it. 

Remember that she‚Äôs experienced with emotional pain and suffering on the inside that you cannot even begin to imagine. She goes through internal suffering that 50% of our kind will at least attempt to kill themselves once in their lives just to escape from it. Don‚Äôt let yourself get hurt just to play it out, your going to have to develop a little bit of shielding over your heart right now. 

To her, feeling hell on the inside is just a normal thing that comes and goes, she‚Äôs a pro in feeling hurt and miserable on the inside and won‚Äôt really understand what the big deal is if you are hurt from her leading you on. She‚Äôs got too low of self esteem to think she‚Äôs that important. Try to flip a little of the mind fukkery around on her and act like your just living your life and don‚Äôt need to have her attention. Don‚Äôt be the one initiating the texts whatever you do, only respond to her if she texts you for now."
BipolarSOs,fm9l0ac,t1_fm9e5g3,1585870897.0,"She sounds like she went manic on you, I‚Äôm sorry that you had to be a victim of this illness, even when we are on meds we can still go through the ups and downs, the meds just sort of keep things stable unless we get triggered. Starting New relationships are a big trigger for hypo mania due to the extra feel good chemistry our brains get when we are attracted to a new partner. Some people even recommend that we get our meds adjusted when we enter into a new relationship because of this. 

It sucks how mean this illness can make us sometimes, I‚Äôm sure that her balanced self is full of empathy, however we can lose sight of other people‚Äôs feelings when sick. Remember that her initial attraction to you wasn‚Äôt all fake, there‚Äôs some genuine attraction for you on her part at some level. Her initial attraction was just really amplified. Hang in there and don‚Äôt take the cold hard things that she‚Äôs said to you to hard, she will probably feel bad for saying them after the manic high wares off. (If she remembers even saying it at all, we lose chunks of memory too, so that‚Äôs a high possibility)

After the high comes the low, it will be inevitable, none of us can avoid the punishment of what comes after the high. When this happens be prepared for the possibility for her to come back around. When she comes down, her self esteem will be the opposite of what it is right now (really low and vulnerable) and when it happens you will probably magically meet her standards again.

I‚Äôd love to date a Bipolar girl if I could find one, but unfortunately they are so rare and hard to come by. Think of them as a dangerous motorcycle with so much horsepower that they are hard to ride at first, but boy are they fun when you learn how to get on it."
