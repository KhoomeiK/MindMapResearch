bipolar1,fgt47d6,t3_f09yro,1581098696.0,"That was literally my experience with seroquel when I got outta the psych ward.  I was also on a low dose lithium and instead of increasing lithium my psych would increase seroquel and add other stuff to get me to sleep bc I was in full mania since leaving the hospital. I got up to 800mg of seroquel and it still wasnâ€™t helping and finally my psych listened and switched me over to zyprexa which has been helping way more than seroquel ever did. 

Long story short, talk to the psych it sounds like you need to increase seroquel and add lithium maybe"

bipolar_irl,fg0r586,t1_fg0qf56,1580413395.0,Itâ€™s been a whirlwind let me tell you but I started seeing a psych and got diagnosed and then had a. Major depressive episode that I had to take a trip to the psych ward and when I got out I was seeing my psych a therapist and group therapy and then I stopped group therapy bc of stress and anxiety spiraling out of control and then mania came back and I stopped seeing my therapist and barely kept contact wit psych all the while my meds kept either changing completely or the dosages kept increasing... Iâ€™m on lithium since right after the hospital and Iâ€™m finally off seroquel and on zyprexa and Iâ€™m more stable than I was but not stable enough to be on my own again. I see my psych maybe 1 or 2 times a month if needed and still not back in therapy though

Seroquel wasnâ€™t helping me sleep at all so my psych told me to quit cold turkey and gave eszopiclone for sleep instead and welp I havenâ€™t sleep more than 6 hours this entire week and the only thing thatâ€™s keeping me from full mania right now is the other withdrawal symptoms of seroquel. Iâ€™m supposed to start olanzapine today and hope it helps! I was already cleaning a non dirty floor yesterday
