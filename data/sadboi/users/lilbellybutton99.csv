zoloft,fr0vcc1,t1_fr0s6lk,1589807605.0,"I used to take it in the morning but it made me lose my appetite and I slept all day! That was at the beginning though so I might try it again, thanks :)"
zoloft,fp43kzm,t3_gawa9j,1588291003.0,"The exact same thing happened to me! I drank several cups of coffee a day for YEARS and enjoyed them so much. Then shortly after starting sertraline I lost all interest and the mere thought of a hot coffee turned me, but iced coffees still appealed to me. It's been 6 months now and I can drink coffee again but as long as it's a cappuccino"
CatAdvice,fnmkin4,t3_g2g0kj,1587073079.0,"I used to find my kitten inside cardboard boxes, in the radiator, inside the sleeves of warm coats and inside my bed. Like she would climb into the drawer under my bed and then climb inside my bed lol.
Maybe check the hotpress/boiler too? All your cupboards, under the sink.
Behind any furniture or inside any drawers.
Hope you find your kitten safe and well"

Hi, we are a small neighbourhood and we are working so hard in the Derby but we need more active members. The main active players are roughly level 50-65.
We participate in the derby, donate and trade where we can and help each other out where we can. We can be chatty if you wish but most of the chat is just requests or offers for items. 
I know we could try to join a new derby together but we want to stick together and try and build up our own.

My tag is #PRRU20L8Y

Neighbourhood tag is #PVGU2PYY

Come join:)"
CrimeJunkiePodcast,fniwwwb,t1_fniwe3c,1586987815.0,"I love the way Ashley tells stories. Even if you don't like supernatural / conspiracies, they are still enjoyable because of how mysterious the stories are"
zoloft,fniwneq,t3_g1s2b4,1586987679.0,"I had a dream that there was this robot that was killing anyone that had germs on them. Like really scary female robot. There was also little small piles of white powder on the floor and if you stepped on them you literally just exploded on the spot. Later, for some reason I wiped my bum with an orange peel? And then gave the orange peel to my friend (just in the dream, not irl friend) so that he could wipe his bum with it? And I knew that the already-used orange peel would put my germs onto him and he would get killed. This was just a fraction."

CrimeJunkiePodcast,fnivfwr,t1_fnisu8g,1586987059.0,Hmm I'm not sure if the supernatural podcast will decrease the amount of episodes they produce for CJ because it's kinda a commitment to their patreons. I'm really enjoying the supernatural podcast ATM too but I miss Brit haha. Cheers!
CrimeJunkiePodcast,fniv43s,t1_fnisqpl,1586986894.0,"That sounds like a smart idea lol I'm gonna do that, I just need more crime junkie because no other crime podcast is cutting it for me. Thanks!"
zoloft,fmmwcqb,t3_fw03gv,1586213340.0,"2 months 50mg, 2 months 100mg and now 2 months on 150mg. I'm sticking with 150mg for now as it seems to be working better than 100."
puppy,fmmw7jf,t3_fw8bvx,1586213261.0,Info: this is my little 8 week old miniature schnauzer. She's so sweet. We are slowly introducing her to my 3 year old Lakeland terrier (male) Finley. Any tips on getting my 3 year old dog used to the pup are welcome too!

zoloft,fl6is9f,t3_fmkq4q,1584870825.0,On 150mg and no weight gain even though I've been eating more.. which is great
zoloft,fk43qpp,t1_fk3wuzm,1583852681.0,Is that doubling up on antidepressants? I would try anything at this point
zoloft,fk43mmf,t1_fk3y7sg,1583852612.0,I really need a boost too I'm sick of being so drained
zoloft,fk0p3lz,t1_fjzr2y8,1583762888.0,It was only one instance and it was actually when I had forgotten to take my meds before bed so I was thinking it was withdrawal? Only a few hours after I was due to take it though
CrimeJunkiePodcast,fk0au3i,t3_fbr07z,1583750172.0,Did anyone else sense the shade from Todd towards redball? Basically how it was pointless and that the detective on it just read stoneys notes lol
mentalhealth,fjz3enp,t3_fffuhg,1583710468.0,I'm proud of you!! We are all rooting for ya :)
zoloft,fjy6a1c,t3_ffg1zf,1583690669.0,"That's funny because I used to drink 3-6 cups a day before taking Zoloft but since starting, I've gone off coffee for some reason! I need it for energy though so I've started drinking about 2 a day"
zoloft,fjy12mp,t1_fjx98l4,1583687698.0,Thanks! Its never happened before so it was just a bit of a shock.
zoloft,fjy10u0,t1_fjy0qcq,1583687670.0,Oh I've never heard of doing that! Does the magnesium just help you sleep or does it do something to relax your legs? Thanks :)
medical_advice,fjureef,t1_fjupusq,1583619428.0,Maybe that's what happened. I've never reacted this way to a blood test so it was a little frightening incase there was an infection or something wrong. Thanks!
medical_advice,fjtb3yo,t1_fjslz9m,1583606066.0,"I didn't notice any issues at all, it was all over relatively quick as she said she was using a bigger needle due to it being a bigger vein. I never watch the actual procedure but it seemed to go smoothly so I'm confused as to why there is so much bruising and it's still sore. Did they just do a bad job?"
zoloft,fj64khb,t3_fbr1el,1583056385.0,"I (20F) was on 50mg for 2 months then increased to 100mg for 2 months and will likely increase again soon. At the beginning I really struggled with a loss of appetite but about 2 months in I started taking it after dinner instead of at breakfast and my appetite has completely returned.
It hasn't made me gain weight, if anything I lost weight from the loss of appetite and I'm just gaining it back now.
I have always suffered with fatigue and sertraline has definitely contributed further to how tired I am and I really do struggle to get out of bed for work and school, which is something I always struggled with but Im leaving it really really late to get up because I just can't.
I haven't had any issues with increasing acne and yes my sex drive has decreased significantly, but not completely. It's yet to return to normal 
And I wouldn't say I feel like a robot or my personality has changed but I do feel less preoccupied and focused on the problems that consumed me before medication. So yes I might feel less paranoid and upset by minor things but I just need to remember that it isn't a personality change.

It's really just a journey and whatever side effects you may go through when trying new medications are worth the end goal of being happy. I wish you the best of luck in your journey :)"
offmychest,fchkquk,t3_egr6py,1577651373.0,"I am glad you're still here too. I play hayday too so I know the importance of diamonds and coins and understand how it may feel like a waste and that you have to start from scratch. BUT from what I see, you are SO good at this game and are really intelligent so don't give up! However a game addiction so strong that you contemplate suicide is really worrying and I hope you are okay and can seek help or guidance. Although what your gf did was cruel and nasty, your reaction, too, is concerning and may suggest you might need to cut down on how much you play it. I sincerely hope you are okay and can overcome this."
