AnxietyDepression,esi9m3o,t3_c7qvpw,1562009447.0,"Donâ€™t be afraid. True friends are there to support, listen and understand you. I was feeling the same way with mine but she always reminded me that she was there for me no matter what. 

If she is as great as you are describing her, she would prefer you telling her how you are feeling so you can have a sense of relief even if it is just for a second. 


If you are truly concerned, talk to her about this and go from there


Hope this helpðŸ˜Š"

AnxietyDepression,esg3wlx,t1_esfoe6m,1561942475.0,Thank you I will talk to my therapist!
Anxiety,esf714q,t3_c75o8y,1561918707.0,Definitely! Just having a person who will not judge you but actually listen to what you are going through and work on making each day easier is the right thing to do.
