I was actually driving to culinary school for my second trimester exam ,basically 1/3 of my grade ,  in a really great mood, Not having slept for the 3rd or 4th day in a row, couple hours here and there, I’m sure you know how it goes lol, and the realization just hit me like a ton of bricks that I had to pull over. From 16-23 I would go off and on to therapy when I was really down but when my mood magically improved I thought I was in the clear, and the cycle went on like that for some time. And really my mania, more like hypomania just presented itself as more confidence , I had the nerve to ask out the cute girl from class, etc . It wasn’t until I started messing with drugs that it really fucked up my episodes. I’m not sure where you are on your journey, how old you are but if you can learn from my fuckups self medicating, while maybe anecdotally helpful  at first is the worst thing you can do..And keep taking those pictures , I’m sure there are some gems somewhere in that million!!

I keep telling myself one of these days I’ll get my shit together when it’s a more convenient time lol, but I do understand I just have to rip the bandaid off so to speak and actually work at it. Your words are really encouraging and from the first post I think really struck a chord with me . I’m gonna try and make a real go of it this time around. If I have to grin and bare it with withdrawals, that really aren’t that bad with Kratom, what better time than a global pandemic when I actually have what could be all the time in the world to get sober , and like you said , the real hard part is staying sober. But I think it’s time I listen to the universe on this one and turn this negative situation (Coronavirus granted I don’t get sick , lol fingers crossed) and realize it for the blessing in disguise it can and should be. What better getting sober story than yeah, I kicked my habit during the Coronavirus pandemic 😂😂. But thanks for the push in the right direction, your words haven’t and won’t fall on deaf ears and while I know it won’t always feel this easy, I’m going into this with a sense of calm and determination that I hope to report back to you in a short time to let you know I’m on the right path , and I hope that in turn can help you in your journey knowing that you made such a positive impact on a complete  stranger .

BipolarReddit,fl024vp,t3_flo0ke,1584688446.0,"Congrats on the future baby. Sending good vibes and hoping for health and happiness for you and your growing family. I couldn’t even imagine dealing with this disorder while carrying another human inside my body so big props to you!! I’ve been anti meds throughout my entire mental health journey . From being a teenager and being told I had social anxiety disorder until I finally figured out myself ,that I’d be depressed , seek therapy at my lowest, then when it would magically go away and I’d be on top of the world only to come crashing down again , that I was Bipolar. And that was 9 years ago . I’ve been deathly afraid of the side effects, mainly telling myself I didn’t want to gain weight, and then ironically enough after practically giving up on life and self isolating (I was doing it before corona made it cool ) I gained 60 pounds in one year. I’ve been anit meds, I’d tell myself and others, all while self medicating with every drug I could get my hands on. I’ve developed an insanely expensive opioid habit and tonight I did about 1.5 grams of coke. Alone . In my room, all the while , peering out the blinds convinced I can hear the neighbors bad mouthing me. In short, I’m having a pretty rough go of it at the moment . And I can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel . I know what I should be doing , but i think I’m afraid of what happens if I do all the right things and I’m still miserable , if that makes any sense . Anyway I saw your invitation to rant , and I grabbed at it like it was a life preserver , holding on for dear life ."

The majority of the time I’m depressed and when I do start to feel a manic episode coming I’m usually really looking forward to it as it usually just equates to a more confident version of myself. Sure I’ve done really stupid/bordering on dangerous things here and there but I’m at a point in my life where I’ve learned to see the signs of an episode coming on and I think I’ve been doing a decent job of keeping myself in check. As long as I can stay a away from drugs I’ve learned to harness the new found energy and creativity and try to be as productive as possible , as long as it lasts. But there are times when I really think I’m not handling my disease responsibly and I should be on medication, more so for the depression than the mania"
