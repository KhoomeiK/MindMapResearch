Or to see the next Marvel movie. Find a book series to read or reread.  Get a crappy car and fix it up. Learn to sew and make cute caps for kids going into surgery. Sign up to help with meals on wheels and visit with lonely old folks. Start writing your life story and turn it into a book. Repaint your bedroom a different color. Good luck. I’m pulling for you."
