I don't really judge the organization by the zealots within, I judge it based on the fact that Bernie seems to at best ignore the divisiveness and at worst enable it at times and that's really a reflection on his ability to unite people to me, personally. More than anything this just solidifies me not giving him a second look. 

In an ideal world I do like the policies that Bernie puts forth and I would love to live in a version of the USA that was more like that -- but -- I also do not personally believe that Bernie would be able to push through many of his goals through the other branches because even many elected Democrats don't go for them. 

If he could walk out into the Rose Garden, shake his finger in the air, and yell ""Medicare For ALL"" and it just happened I'd be with him 100% -- but as we all know that's not how the system works. 

I like Bernie, I like his policies. I just want something that has a chance of getting done in 4 years even if it isn't perfect. I've accepted that M4A won't come overnight but instead bit by bit and I think a public option is the first reachable bit. It sucks and I don't like it - but - that's just where I personally believe we are as a country.

EDIT: To be clear this is still a primary, so, I'm going with my personal feelings. If Bernie wins the nomination I will undoubtably set those personal feelings aside and support him 110%. I'll happily do outreach, contribute to the campaign, and vote for him. NO question about that."
