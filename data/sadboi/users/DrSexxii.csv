Also, are there any leagues you have worked with that you won’t work with any more? 
Are there any leagues that you’d like to work for?

All are talented and have good resumes and they can start to branch off on their opponents. But they all do a good job at just rapping about things ANYONE could understand. Starts making it easy to find what you like and making it easier to understand other battles. It’s tough watching a smack battle and having to pause to explain, who smack is, who beesly is, who norbs is, what a PG is, who Nunu nails is, who’s in cave gang, who is in gun titles, who is in the goonies, who’s in NWX, why Charlie says he’s a vegan but still getting fatter, the references to RBE, KOTD, Champion, what happened at the last event that made them say that one thing in the battle now.

DadFeels,esfk20i,t3_c7irbx,1561928114.0,"There was a bunch of weird images shown, a song that kept playing, and dad doesn’t hate pewdiepie. 

Several images that flashed showed a clear glass or

Crystal ball with what could have been a flower inside of it sitting on the ground in the middle of a desert plain, some of the images had DAD in the back ground walking near it, and then at one point it showed him in its reflection seemingly looking up at something. There was also and image of a women underwater, and another with Dad behind the tail of a rocket ship that was labeled NASA 810. When asked about it DAD said he didn’t know what it is that it could be some sort of bus that people ride in space. He suggested that we look on the nasa website to look into it. So I did and found NASA Code 810. I’ll put the link at the bottom. Very interesting but I’m not sure it’s the right direction. 

Also, Dad mentioned that when he went into the room to stream there was a door. As soon as he started the stream he couldn’t find the door any more as if it wasn’t there, he kept saying he sees what we see on the screen or something like that. 

Tom came into the stream and started saying he was gonna expose DAD about Diane to WIFE. During dads stream he also flashed and image of a clear tea pot full of tea. 

Tom started a stream as DAD was ending his so DAD came into Toms chat and told him not to drink the tea that he wasn’t safe if he did. 

Oddly, Tom had a full glass of tea in a clear cup that looked strangely similar to tea pot DAD showed. Tom drank all the tea and then went off about UFOs, ELEMENT 115, and Bob Lazar. 

Towards the end of Toms stream NATHAN came into the chat and joked about how he still wears the foil. 

Also, DAD said several times that he is roughly 7 Eons old. 

Something to note. There was spaces of time where dad would just leave images on the screen. When the camera would come back to him he would start talking as if it was the very very beginning of his stream. Like he hadn’t been streaming for an hour already. Very strange.
