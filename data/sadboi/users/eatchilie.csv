To give you my own experience, for the first few weeks I really beat myself up for not starting a bunch of side projects, or getting up any earlier than 8:50 to start work at 9 (working from home), keeping the apartment as tidy as I think it should be, etc. This combined with the frustration at the lack of control or knowledge of when this will end was very difficult and still sometimes gets me.

Now I'm still feeling a bit rubbish some days, but I do feel much more chill and ok about it all since I started taking some of the imagined pressure off myself. If I want to do something I will, and the advantage of being alone during this is that if I don't, it's no big deal.

He's got a degree but his mental health has severely deteriorated since he started uni and since he finally graduated he's now unemployed and living at home, he's never been able to work. We're in the process of finding out more about an assisted living place nearby but the more he finds out about it the less keen he is, for the same reasons as your brother.

He also expresses a wish for the same thing - to be ""part of normal life"". It's tough to hear because I desperately wish for the same thing for him, and year by year it feels less and less likely, and dwelling on that and the uncertainty it brings can feel suffocating. Sure we'll find a solution that'll work for the next 5 or 10 years, but what happens in 20 or 30? Eventually it'll be just us, and I don't know what life will be like then.

That sense of responsibility and fear about what on earth will happen is always there and it's good to acknowledge it, and don't let it engulf you. You don't know what the situation will be, but you'll figure each new scenario out as it comes and find a solution for it that works for you, your brother and your loved ones. 

In terms of practical advice, there are benefits available in the UK for vulnerable people. The system can be complex to navigate but they do exist, and if your brother is entitled to support he should be getting it. Definitely worth looking deeply into for your area if you haven't already, there may be something you guys can apply for.

I was relieved to have gotten an appointment pretty quickly and that the doctor was so nice and understanding. I was so nervous about booking an appointment with the GP for something not physical, because services are super stretched here. I was afraid I would be told off wasting their time or something. Thankfully he was wonderful. 

I was told the SSRI will take time to start having an effect, so the propranolol is meant to hopefully help with the physical symptoms of acute anxiety attacks in the meantime and maybe help me relax to concentrate better at work. He also said that if I need to take time off work to get some headspace, he is happy to sign-off on that, and the knowledge that that is now available to me is a huge relief in itself.

I do the dropping off thing too when things get heavy. It's not that I deliberately decide not to, it's more like the amount of 'tasks' I can handle shrinks and I have to ration that energy for things that can't be dropped, like work or a family situation. The guilt of not responding can really make things worse so people being understanding really helps. My best friend does it too and we have a mutual agreement that it's totally ok when one of us disappears. No judgement or nagging and we are both there when one of us really needs some support. Just knowing that she loves me no matter what state I'm in is enough, she doesn't need to do anything else. 

If either of us disappear for longer than is usual we will check in on each other, but still with 0 pressure and no prying questions. A ""this-made-me-think-of-you"" meme and a simple ""how are things?"" is usually enough to spark a chat. The other person might say what's been going on with them, or they'll respond with another jokey thing and a normal convo will happen, and it's all good.

I personally struggled to enjoy Moby Dick, and yet count James Joyce as one of my favourite authors. You talk about wanting to be 'led' through a story like it's a bad thing, somehow 'lesser'. Charles Dickens does exactly this surely? And who decided that fantasy is also somehow 'lesser'?

What I do find frustrating is when people make judgments about what I read/watch/listen to. Maybe the people you mention's frustration comes from a similar place.

I think people find their own path through books that bring them personal value. You're right, maybe people have their own obstacles to work through, or maybe they don't. Either way I'd argue that it isn't your responsibility, you can find your own tribe and not have to worry about it :)"

Adding it to the list!"
books,fcf5wtd,t1_fcb210a,1577626931.0,"Totally agree, I think it's beginning to get credit now as being more than that, seeing it begin to appear on lists and recommendations alongside other more classically ""deep"" titles lately"
books,fcf58u4,t1_fcb18d4,1577626706.0,Ooh thanks! I'll add it to the list
books,fcf53f0,t1_fcajxqb,1577626653.0,"Ditto! At least for a long long time. I thought I had lost the capacity, it seems not lol"
books,fcf4r2d,t1_fcaz114,1577626587.0,"Oh interesting! It did feel somewhat detached from itself, maybe that was intentional, or perhaps because of some ignorance on Rooney's part like you say? I don't know. I would argue that the characters aren't especially liked overall in the book, especially Marianne. I don't know a lot about Rooney herself, you've prompted me to consider that, thanks!"

books,fcf1xua,t1_fc9r4hq,1577625913.0,"That's a good point about their intelligence. It's the one thing that didn't feel relatable about either of them. There's nothing wrong with them being that smart in itself, but I agree it was a fact that felt a little glossed over. I suppose maybe one way of looking at it could be that extreme academic intelligence, wealth, beauty and success don't make us immune to emotional self-sabotage?"
books,fcf0uai,t1_fc9av6n,1577625581.0,"Totally, I think I would've been disappointed in 'happy ever after' sort of ending, it wouldn't have felt congruent with the story or actually very comforting. The ambiguity was more satisfying :)"
52book,fc95x1p,t3_egrbs2,1577547543.0,"I’m a medical illustrator working for a studio in the UK and I enjoy music, drawing and walking as well. Last year I set a general goal of reading more and made it to 36 books. This year I’m setting my goal at 40 and would also like to make a bigger proportion of those as physical books, as last year it was mostly audiobooks (easier to get through as I can listen at work! But I don’t tend to remember them as well). Chuffed to have found a subreddit full of people with similar goals.

I’m starting off the year with Wolf Hall by Hilary Mantel and Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami :)"
