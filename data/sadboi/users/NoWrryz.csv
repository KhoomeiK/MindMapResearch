shortscarystories,fb6dvbx,t1_fb694os,1576547852.0,No worries. I wasn't suggesting changing anything with your story. I just meant it felt very universal. If you do try it I am interested in seeing the results. Good luck!
shortscarystories,fb6894e,t1_fb63ox6,1576543853.0,Thank you for the read and comment. I just read your story and found it easy to understand. I did see how it could be considered political but I felt you could change some names and put it in any recent time period or in the future. If that makes sense. I did like the story and was not expecting the ending. It was an enjoyable read.

Standup,f7l7ulf,t3_dwfkde,1573834600.0,"Really enjoyed it. I've done a two open mics so, clearly, I'm an expert in this. I thought it flowed really well. One thing I always look for is how the comedian reacts to hecklers or something unexpected. I dont know if this was planned or improved but when you mentioned about everyone having a paper but you, it felt genuine. Should have got more laughs with that crowd. It was great. Keep it up"
