Since I already went to the hospital yesterday I'm gonna give it another day and if I'm still shaky and get heart palpitations, I'll go back to the hospital tomorrow."

schizophrenia,fqnu5bz,t1_fqlsq2g,1589501456.0,"That sounds interesting, it's fascinating how schizophrenia affects everyone differently! But perhaps you two should try to find a solution for that with professional help if there is one. If there's not, I think you should keep doing what you're doing and just leave her alone, seems like the best choice."

Yes, I am on medication but I think my mind is tricking me into believing I took my meds when in reality, I didn't, I just realised that. So, yeah... I'll try to avoid that and actually try to take my meds which I really need to.
