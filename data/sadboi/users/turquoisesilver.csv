depression,flwn47m,t3_frgmpw,1585557077.0,"Ditto had this realisation last week, I feel like we are all in a similar boat now and it's helped motivate me in some ways. I've actually found some of the self isolation tips people are sharing helpful and I'm helping family with how to stay sane during isolation. With all this advice on exercise at home I'm starting to have a self care routine built on everyone's tips for self isolation.

That being said the people that have recently said 'how hard is it to stay at home' are irritating. I've been trying to leave my home for months. Being isolated is not healthy and if people do end up being isolated for several months (rather the few weeks that most people have had) I think they will start to realise what it does to your head.

I guess I have mixed feelings about this realisation. I do sometimes feel like I'm drowning in a sea of scared people that are making all  mental health support and pharmacies busier than usual."

harrypotter,fkn6tul,t3_fjc7wr,1584356026.0,"My theory is that:

a) Kids knew they would be bullied by Dudley and his gang if they became friends with Harry.

b) If Dudley heard that Harry was enjoying himself away from the house you just know that Vernon and Petunia would try and stop it. It's like Mrs Figg said, she had to make Harry's visits to her house unpleasant enough so that Dursleys didn't stop them.

c) I don't actually think Harry was very confident making friends outside of Hogwarts. From childhood he was never encouraged to talk to people which could have hindered his ability to make friends for life if it wasn't for Hogwarts. Thankfully when he went to Platform 9^(3/4) the Weasleys immediately took him under their wing and his confidence grew from there.  This made him extremely confident with Wizard's chess, talking about quidditch and other wizarding things. However in the muggle world he wasn't able to watch TV, he has restricted conversations and experiences. This probably made Harry feel more alienated from the Muggle world and less confident in striking up a conversation.

I'm not saying Harry's a wall flower, he certainly knows how to stand up for himself, I just think his abuse by the Dursleys isolated him in Privet Drive."

Being 'in a sulk'  is not something you can easily control when you are depressed, faking being happy can just really hurt you. So if someone looks upset/blank and doesn't say a lot, I think a bit of patience is needed because they may well have depression or other stuff to deal with that they aren't ready to share.

HOWEVER, I have been on the receiving end of people raising the fact they are depressed at inappropriate times to the point that it feels manipulative. A family member of mine with depression usually ends big arguments with 'noone cares about me', 'I'm all alone' and sometimes 'I might as well end it now'. Baring in mind this is usually after they have yelled abuse at me for a solid 10 minutes. I can't help but feel manipulated. They have effectively verbal bashed me and then gone into how their problems make them the real victim. I'm sorry, I have depression too and the nasty things you said before you broke down are your responsibility to resolve/ apologise for. Any forgiveness I give because I empathise with your situation needs to be appreciated because I've been hurt by you and decided to rise above it.

Another example of bad behaviour was when I got yelled at, in public, by a coworker once for being a few minutes late on my break and afterwards she was excused by another coworker because she had depression. I'm sorry fellow people with depression, I am fine if you look miserable, have a snarky tone and want to share some negative thoughts that you are not proud of because I get it.

After your initial induction your boss expects you to  work out what work needs doing on your own and you can't 'leave early' just because you've done all the boss'set tasks. They also have no obligation to put up with someone who is clearly relaxing when there is work to be done. If you annoy them, they will find a way to formally discipline you eventually and these days most employers put newbies under probation so that  they can quickly fire them if they don't like them. That's not to scare you, most good boss' aren't around to find faults with work, they are there to plan resources and encourage staff to move the organisation in the right direction but that doesn't mean they are going to sit you aside every day and coach you on how to not be a rude employee.

As an English person from the North, if you tell us that you made a special effort to go to our town and not to the London tourist hot spots, we'll be fascinated and love to talk to you. As for London itself, I think everyone there is used to some language barriers as they experience so many different tourists there all the time. So I wouldn't worry about imitating accents perfectly, the main thing is to be confident with your English vocabulary.

I think listening to the accent for a while also helps more than learning a set of rules. The link looks good, you could also watch some TV shows to really get used to the accents in the Uk. I'll give some examples in case this is helpful.

I know someone who has a high flying job and kids but suffers from stress at work and post natal depression . They have no idea what to do next and are questioning all their choices.

The second thing to know is that people who have a life that looks like it is going to plan (in a very broad sense) can find something completely knocks it out of touch. I have found when my depression got really bad I needed to leave my job and house and live with my family aso I was not alone with my thought in my house.

I think everyone feels like an imposter when doing something new at work but what you'll learn is some employees are just good at hiding it through a confident voice and management speak. Trust me, the further in your career you go you'll go from being intimidated to finding these fakes annoying. People that are good at their job ask questions and refer to more experienced staff with confidence when they are stuck. They also show that they value others insight and expertise, take a mental note of what they are taught and show that they have learnt from it at the appropriate time. They don't risk making mistakes just to look like they know what they are doing, they clarify instructions. As someone who has trained first time employees I don't expect much more than this ability to learn and ask questions (and to not slack off). My training method is to show the person how it is done, ask them to try something with me supervising them and then the next time I just leave it to them to ask me for help.

Its great that you have found a job and are paying some of the rent. I wouldn't brush that aside, those are big steps to independence.I don't think being 30 puts a limitation to you doing what you want to do. I know this is hard to accept though, I myself am nearing 30 and I contemplate whether the things that led to nowhere in my 20s were a waste of time but ultimately people are reinventing themselves all the time. I can see with some people things click into place all at once later in life. My sister spent decades thinking she would never have a boyfriend, she then met a great guy, got married within a few years. To think all those years worrying, she could have enjoyed the free time of singledom before getting hitched! 

As for moving, I found the biggest stressor in moving out was just the initial arrangements of finances and conversations with estate agents. Once I had my monthly budget planned,set up my ongoing automatic payments,and had the keys to the house their wasn't much more upheaval.  The biggest hardship was loneliness and maintaining momentum with housework.

As for people's opinions about what you 'should' be doing at 30, I would pay no mind to the word 'should'. When I told people I was living at home I got funny looks, when I lived on my own someone said 'aren't you lonely? There will always be people who have some idea of what your next step 'should' be, just because it worked for them, it doesn't mean it works for you. Perhaps you need more time to feel confident in this job and that's fine, take your time. And yes depression is misunderstood by society, I keep telling myself to go at my own pace because society does push you to get over things quickly sometimes."
AmericanHorrorStory,fikuxgl,t1_fijqi6d,1582487782.0,"I know the season is called Cult because the writers think that what Kai did was an example of a cult. What I am saying is that I don't buy that the way Kai spoke to these people would inspire them to drink the Kool aid or kill themselves because I did not feel the close knit family type connection, the need in the people to fill a family type void with Kai etc. and all the other classic markers of a cult. Perhaps you have more expertise in how cults like the manson family work than me and that's why I only have a 'nit picky', 'surface level' interpretation. Thank you for letting me know."
AmericanHorrorStory,fijmoht,t1_fijjjzi,1582455235.0,"I am very surprised that a one sentence comment inspired a passionate 4 paragraph response but I'll respond to each point.

1. I have no doubt that people were scared because of the election and they were capitalising on this as the horror genre but the series isn't called 'political scares' it's called 'cult' and there is a difference between herd mentality of a strong political allegiance and the very personal way a cult makes you feel that you are part of a family and that the world outside isn't safe and is evil. A cult feels that they would rather die than live in a world without the cult, it's a real stretch to put this onto political allegiance which as I say, is more like mob mentality.  Overall I don't think putting so much emphasis on 'cult like behaviour' was necessary when there is so much material on actual cults. In fact I think it limited how much they could explore actual cult psychology which is such a horror genre in itself and so worth exploring.
2. Wouldn't have been bothered me if Kai was a Trump supporter or Dem. I don't agree that  the way Kai tried to manipulate them would have worked to the extent they showed it to, as the methods he used are nothing like actual cult methods.

You seem to have enjoyed it so good for you. My original point is that the series is called 'Cult' not 'strong political allegiance' and not 'phobias'."

AskReddit,fij7li4,t1_fii68ut,1582436927.0,"I would say the issue is old buildings. We have lots of old 1960s government buildings with a flat roof that councils spend the majority of their budget on repairing the roof. We knocked down a lot of beautiful architecture for these cheap looking buildings.

We also have beautiful 14th-19th century historical buildings that are also not designed well for disabled access. Long tall winding staircases and heavy doors that are not designed to be held open. I asked about disabled access for an old 1800 building and they said they would basically have to get rid of the entire door frame and start again or something and we didn't have the budget.

My main concern with all this though is we have some really bad fire exits. I remember one building I worked at only had one way out the building - stairs through the middle of the building and then a heavy front door. I didn't feel particularly safe even though I don't need disabled access."

AskReddit,fifzsov,t1_fif4jq5,1582394774.0,"I think it depends. A person may be going through a lot and be a bit in their own head and sometimes a good friend just needs to have some patience. The times where friends have said they are sick of me going on and on about my same problem have really hurt me and is a red flag for me. I remember watching a video about being disabled person in a relationship and they talked about disabled person needing more care than the other. They talked about how it's unhealthy to expect that any relationship will always be 50/50 because sometimes people have more of a need, depending on what they are going through. What they are telling you is a small snapshot of all the turmoil going non-stop through their head and they are talking about themselves not because they don't care about you but because they trust you with their thoughts.

Another reason people talk about themselves a lot is social insecurity, they do not feel confident in their opinions or confident to ask you questions so they do what's safe, talking about their own experience.

To me better red flags for a mis-balanced relationship are:

\- when you tell someone they've missed your call or text and they're not apologetic and/or trying to make up for it.

\-When they get details of what is upsetting you wrong and they  act like it doesn't matter.

\-Constantly talking over you to the point that you try and start the same sentence several times and you never get a 'sorry, you first'."

I am from Yorkshire. Yorkshire is the biggest county in the UK, that also happens to be in the north of England. You could perhaps start with this county accent if you are really interested in imitating a northern accent.

As for what letter I would drop for my own accent, I don't know because dropping letters is not intentional. I would think rather than dropping letters, it would be more useful to hear the sound we make when we try and say words.

To me I just think of Snape as a necessary character because the twist where Snape's motivations were revealed was not only an interesting plot twist but also needed in a story about growing up. As we get older we stop thinking that the adults that took care of us have all the answers (as shown with Dumbledore) and we see that behind the people who 'put you in your place'  was once a youth like you ( as shown with Petunia and Snape). You then realise that if adults don't have all the answers and are fallible just like you, that  you need to step up and make the change you want to see, which is exactly what Harry did in the Deathly Hallows."

AmericanHorrorStory,fhi30at,t3_f1s8jm,1581616807.0,"Just binge watched all the seasons last month, haven't got to 1984 yet as it isn't on Netflix yet. My order of preference is:

1. Asylum . This is the season that seems the most planned, I never felt like they were filling time or making it up as they  go along the whole thing was a beautiful tapestry with a really thought provoking ending. I'm most interested in re-watching this for a 2nd time.
2. Apocalypse - Controversially I liked the ending, I found Micheal really annoying and pathetic and was happy for him to be run down. The only thing I didn't like is that  there was bit of a filler plot just before the last episode that could have been used to lengthen the final showdown and some of the logic behind bringing characters back was poor but I still really liked Apocalypse as I enjoyed having crossovers between Hotel, Murder House and Coven. I think some people would have preferred that it be more scary but to be honest I don't like the show because of the horror genre, I like it because of the themes, interesting characters and layers. That's why I'm interested in seeing what Ryan does with American Crime Story.
3. Murder House - The one that started it all. Seems pretty tame compared to the later season now but still enjoyable in a nostalgic kind of way..
4. Roanoke - definitely one of the more scary seasons. I did enjoy the twist mid season , that was creepy in that it made the whole thing feel more real but for me the pacing was too slow. The show dragged at times and I would have appreciated the twist to start  bit earlier. By the time we got the last episode I was yelling 'why do you keep coming back to this house?!' I was a mixture of frustrated and creeped out.
5. Coven - Some fun characters but I felt some of the storylines were a bit repetitive. Delphine should have left the show once she was handed to Marie Laveau. I also lost interest in all the scrambling around for the supreme and resurrections. I think they could have done more with the axeman beyond being a love interest and more could have been with the Coven protecting itself from outsiders.
6. Freak show - I found this enjoyable but it doesn't stand out like other seasons. I think if you hate Glee you may hate this season as it has some elements of Glee. Everyone groups together as misfits and they are shown to be stonger together like Glee. There are  also a few musical numbers - I wasn't a fan of the cover of a modern Lana del rey song, took away my immersion a bit. Overall though I found the message that everyone is a freak in their own way, that being a monster is something inside of a person. enjoyable if not scary. Loved the interviews with the actors for this, Mat Frazer comparison of Freak shows to prostitution in that you are using your body for money to be interesting.
7. Cult - This both creeped me out and made me cringe. I'm also not sure that they properly researched how Cults work because some of the events, I just don't buy. I think I would have enjoyed it more if the cult wasn't related to politics because to me there is a difference between having a strong allegiance to a political party and  following a cult leader and including modern politics muddled the whole thing but I guess it kept the show relevant for some people.
8. Hotel - I think people that enjoy this season, love Lady Gaga because to me the whole thing is one giant ode to her. The whole thing felt like a big long Lady Gaga music video with similar themes and ostentatious outfits. That being said the worst characters in this for me are Sally and John Lowe. Really think this season could have been put better together and I really don't think it fits well in the AHS universe."
