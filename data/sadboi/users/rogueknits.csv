reactivedogs,fjhzv3u,t1_fjhnstw,1583358123.0,"But people coming here already have the dog, so simply saying ""Just don't get a dog"" is kind of missing the point. We don't get a lot of people here saying ""There's a cute dog at the shelter, but he's reactive and I'm a super busy person who works 90 hours a week and have two little kids. Should I adopt this dog?"" No, we get ""I've had this dog for 6 months and I'm at my wits end. Yesterday he went after a child on the street and almost bit. He's too strong for me to handle on the leash, and my husband refuses to walk him. We have him crated during the day while we're both at work because he tears up the house. How can I get him to calm down?"" 

A lot of times when I've seen people recommend rehoming, it's a post where clearly the owner isn't willing or able to put the time/energy into training the dog. So, we're left with a lot of not so great choices. One option is that we give a bunch of advice that the person isn't willing to take for whatever reason, and they end up making a halfhearted effort for a few months and then surrender the dog to a shelter when it doesn't work right away. Or, we can recommend they start looking for a new home for the dog while they're still willing to take care of it, and hopefully avoid the dog having to spend time in a shelter. So, what's worse for this dog?

And yes, dogs are always work. But, not all dogs are the same amount of work. All of the regular posters here have reactive dogs, and are willing to put in the work. But you have to recognize that there are people out there who while they are perfectly willing/able to take their dog for two nice walks a day, take them to the vet on a regular schedule, play with them, feed them, groom them, and do basic obedience training, that is \*not\* the same thing as dealing with a highly reactive dog who, in addition to all of the above, will need intensive training to even be able to pass people on the street without growling and lunging.  Not everyone is cut out for that, and it's IMO crueler to make a dog stay in that stressful environment where everything it does is ""wrong"" rather than rehoming to someone who \*is\* willing to put in the work."
reactivedogs,fjhxvs1,t1_fjhpoqg,1583357074.0,"I think it's important, though, to recognize that you didn't know about your dog's reactivity when she was still in the shelter. That's incredibly common (which you probably know as a volunteer). Many dogs kind of shut down in the shelter and don't show their true behavior until they've gotten a chance to relax in a home. I know my own dog was not his ""normal"" self for at least a month after I adopted him. If a family brings a dog home, and that dog was by all accounts fine with kids, but suddenly it starts going after the family's toddler, then yeah...that dog's not a good fit for that family and it's really no one's fault. But, a reputable shelter will then note the return in the dog's history and make sure any future potential adopters are made aware. There are lots of people, like me, who don't have kids and can deal with a dog that doesn't like them. But, I do have another dog, so I could never adopt a second dog that wouldn't tolerate my first dog. Pairing up dogs and adopters is not a science, and mistakes get made, unfortunately, despite the best intentions of all involved."

That isn’t an option for everyone. I love him but he has been bad for me financially, socially & sometimes is bad for my mental health (mostly good but some days are so fucking hard). He’s basically a full time job. He’s improving tons so I think it’ll be less work eventually but I’m fucking exhausted for now.

>Some people don’t have the time or willpower to put in the work. They’re unhappy, their dog is stressed & the situation spirals.

Agreed. The dog is not going to get better when the family is unable to put in the time/energy/money into retraining. And, frankly, sometimes even with all of that effort some dogs will just never become a good fit for a particular family. Not everyone is able to turn their lives upside down just because they happened to end up with a reactive dog, and it's probably better for all involved if the dog is rehomed to a family that can give them the attention they need."
Coronavirus,fjhucmf,t1_fjh0h34,1583355218.0,"That's a different patient in Manhattan. She and her husband are in isolation in their home, and by all accounts she was very responsible and did not travel extensively around the city between her return from Iran and diagnosis.

The first Westchester patient did not have any travel to known hot spots. He had recently returned from Miami, and had been to Israel prior to that. They don't know how he got it. This guy started showing symptoms on Feb. 22nd, and ended up in the hospital on the 27th.

Who the hell knows how many people he and his family may have infected in the 5 days before he was hospitalized.

Trying to do it all at once is pretty pricey if you want to buy decent furniture that will last a decade or more. We still have Ikea and hand-me-down furniture in our bedroom (we have replaced the mattress, because sleep is important!), because we focused more on the rooms that visitors will see.

If you are moving from an apartment to a house, it's common to not really have enough furniture to adequately furnish a home. For example, when we moved into our current home, we went from one bedroom to three, had a 10+-year-old futon as our ""couch"", and had no dining room furniture at all. What other furniture we had was a mismatched assortment of hand-me-downs that we got from our parents/grandparents after college. We didn't furnish the whole house at one time (because we weren't flush with cash after putting up the down payment), but it definitely cost a lot more than $3k, and that's not even buying design-focused pieces--we just got some basic, but decent-quality stuff from a mid-range furniture chain. I think we probably spent $3k just on living room furniture (couch, chair, two end tables, storage ottoman)."

So, I would say it's worth a try? Daycare is generally a better option than dog parks because the dogs are all behavior evaluated beforehand and the staff is (usually) trained on dog body language and know when to separate dogs who are getting too worked up, give dogs time outs, etc. I find dog parks hit and miss because anyone can just show up with their dog and owners aren't always paying as close attention as they should be."
