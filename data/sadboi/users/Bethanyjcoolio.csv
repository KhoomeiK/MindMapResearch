Dyslexia,fpnvzbf,t3_ged0qs,1588773700.0,"Wow yeah that's messed up. There are some things I give people a pass on for being uneducated about dyslexia, but rudeness and assholery never gets a pass. It's legit not difficult to be polite. I once worked at a trucking company and I had to input tons of parts orders in the system, handwritten by a man with dyslexia. This was BEFORE I knew I had dyslexia and before I even knew much about it. A single number or letter switched with another or simply missing means I can't find it in the system. I had to frequently ask that man to help me know what part in the system I needed to record a purchase of. He was always so apologetic and I just kept telling him there was nothing to apologize for. His dyslexic traits are very different from mine, so I wasn't even empathizing from my own personal experiences. Just being decent. But I bet he's dealt with assholes like the person in your post his whole life. Ugh! I'm sorry they said that to you. That's so fucking wrong"

aspergers,fjvbrax,t3_docmmk,1583625415.0,"I remind myself that our society still has a dysfunctional habit of thinking that you only bring a child to therapy under the most severe and outlier circumstances. I want to see a shift in our society where taking any child to therapy is normal. No stigma. Even as a short-term skills learning kind of thing if that's all that is necessary for that individual child. My mom didn't have me evaluated because she literally did not understand that there was a need for it. There were numerous times she consulted my pediatrician about certain behaviors of mine, as well as issues in school, and my own pediatrician told her time and time again that my issues were normal childhood experiences. And you know what? I agree with him. But that does *not* mean that you shouldn't take the child to therapy. He did not advise taking me to therapy. Therefore I spent my entire childhood not getting help with my maladaptive daydreaming, my ADHD, my OCD, or my anxiety. I had to repeat a grade. I fell into toxic friend groups. And yet, I don't resent or vilify my old pediatrician. I think he's fantastic. He, alongside most people including doctors, has been taught by society and the medical field that you only bring a child to therapy under severe outlier situations. My way of dealing with the loss of help I could have gotten is by making plans to be a part of the behavioral health community and spreading the message that therapy is normal, beneficial to absolutely everyone, and a great thing to go to."
aspergers,fjv9ja1,t3_diuq3k,1583624497.0,"I'll put it this way: I do not believe that a single person should have to get diagnosed with a syndrome or disorder in order for people around them to take personal interest in understanding why someone else has behaviors that bother them, or lacks unspoken social understandings that other people seem to get naturally. So I don't really have a resentment toward anyone in particular. Instead I wonder why this isn't tought as a part of the concept of common courtesy? I remember getting that hammered into our heads as children at elementary school. I even remember them having us watch an informational video on this kind of thing. We were taught to consider others, but nothing in those lessons taught the concept of considering that some people absorb information differently than others. To consider that some people need different things socially. I realize that, for my entire childhood, I was made to learn about other people in order to function with them. But not a'one of them were made to learn about me and people like me. So I more see how there is a deficit in society about recognizing this kind of thing, and that's what bothers me. So I want to be a part of the effort to make a change in that area"

DAE,fgrx7vu,t3_f05fhk,1581061119.0,"In 2008, I isolated myself from people because I noticed a pattern of unhealthy friendships and I needed to get away from all of it. For the following 8 years, I was happy that way and only kept light contact with certain friendly acquaintances that I thought were good people. Then 2015 rolled around and I started desiring close friendship again. I opened myself up to hanging with people and noticed I was facilitating friendships just like the previous ones I isolated myself away from. So I became distant again and slowly opened back up again. After therapy and self reflection, I slowly grew as a person and got to a point that I could healthfully and slowly nurture the relationships I had with certain friendly acquaintances that I could see friendship-potential with.  2019 was my best year as far as friendships went. It's because in 2018 I can proudly say that I did a good and consistent job of gently nurturing those relationships and so 2019 was a year of enjoying them all as great friendships. I now regularly see those people and text them and I feel valued. I'm commenting this because I want you to know that it does take time but once you get there, man is it wonderful. Do some self reflection and growth and gently nurture the friendly acquaintances you have right now. And if you don't have any, you can create some. We can't expect a best friendship to develop overnight. It's so true when they say that good things come with hard work and perseverance.  Don't let that discourage you. The time it takes to develop close friendships is time you're spending on yourself to like yourself and become someone who will be a wonderful friend to the people you're meant to be friends with :)"
