mentalhealth,fmu91kx,t3_fx2qdr,1586386820.0,"I feel like mine has gotten better. 
I'm furloughed so I dont have any stresses of work, I dont have the stress of being around people. My PTSD makes it difficult to sometimes go out in public. I have nothing forcing me to go outside of my comfort zone, I get to stay in, do what I want to do. I dont have to stress if I have had a terrible night sleep which happens frequently, as I know I dont have to get up early or have a stressful day ahead of me. 

I struggle if my mental health declines and I need distractions outside of my house, but all in all. This has been the best thing for me and I'm actually worried about re adjusting when it goes back to normal."

ptsd,fcosb2m,t3_eia3x2,1577840207.0,"I actually have a white noise machine and it's done wonders for me. Sudden noises and repetitive noises affect me so having white noise to drown most of it out has been fantastic. If you dont use white noise, definitely start. It's the most useful tool"

dogs,fclpp86,t3_eho07v,1577753455.0,"It's difficult, on one hand my pup now & my previous dog who died a year back were amazing for my mental health. To have something you know loves you and wants to be near you no matter what, is an incredible feeling when you're down. 
However. On the other hand, it's a lot of responsibility, I have anxiety over if shes okay all the time. Sometimes when she is excitable I cabt deal with it, and theres times she wants to be on me and I need space.
It is always around 85% good and 15% bad for me. 
I'm very lucky to have a husband who picks up a lot of it when I cant do it. He will walk her if I cant. He gets up with her every morning, and takes her and distracts her when I need my alone time. 

I know I couldn't have a dog if I was on my own, because of the responsibility involved and the stresses. But with my husband, we make an incredible team and have had a wonderful German shepherd who passed a year ago, and now have a very energetic 6 month old puppy. I owe him a lot for allowing me to have my time and space, but still being able to have a dog"
EntitledBitch,fcaudfu,t3_egt217,1577576793.0,"I mean, if they're moaning about this big family and birth control not being able to tip.... surely if you're not well skilled and the only job you can do is a min wage waiter/waitress job you shouldn't also have 5 other mouths to feed plus animals. 

In the uk I know all waiters/resses are paid at least minimum wage and although that's not amazing, I genuinely dont believe in if you cant afford to tip you cant afford to eat out. 

Its not my problem you lack the skills to get a better paying job...

And dont get me wrong. I'm in no way smart. Nor am I considered lucky. But I've gained the skills necessary to have a job that pays me enough to have nice things."
Anxiety,fc6to44,t3_egeuja,1577489214.0,"I'm on what we call venlafaxine in the uk. It's the same medication Google tells me. Just different  names. 
I'm on a higher dose than you, I too read all of the terrible comments about it. The withdrawals and everything and it did scare me. But... it's working for me. I'm pretty stable. I have ptsd, depression, GAD, and Body dysmorphia. So I have highs and lows. However it helps me cope. I do regularly miss it because I'm terrible with tablets. But all in all I find it's been a much better fit for me than most other anti  ds. And I've been through a whole bunch of them.i do find if I havent taken them for a few days I get headaches and vertigo. But once I've started again I seem fine. I have heard the side effects of withdrawals are awful but, I cant worry about that until I'm possibly taken off of them, and unfortunately it doesnt look like that will be anywhere in the near future for me. 
Every person is different with medications try not to let horror stories put you off. Give your body a chance with them and see how you go. Your opinion and feelings with it are the only ones that should matter"
Anxiety,fc6s8gh,t3_egdvfl,1577488164.0,"I genuinely had to quit yoga because of this. 
I was told by my therapist and doctor to try yoga, to help me socially and also to help my anxiety. 
It was horrific for me. Every second of silence I would be internally screaming, intrusive thoughts would come flooding in and I would panic. 
I think it made it worse that i was then aware if i made a scene of had a panic attack I would disrupt others. 

I had 3 sessions and each one was awful. I couldn't go back after."
AskHR,f8dhzwu,t3_e09nly,1574491689.0,"As soon as you ask the question of should I look for another job the answer is yes. If you dont enjoy your job it shows and its miserable. Mot everyone loved their job but, it should always be okay to go to work, to be treated fairly, and to have enough work to do. 
I wouldn't be working somewhere like that. You'll become miserable."
ptsd,f8dh6om,t3_e0ae8x,1574490652.0,"I have complex PTSD, I tried CBT but that didnt help so I moved to emdr. Personally for me, I ended up dissassociating throughout a lot of sessions and panicking that  the finger wasnt moving at a fast enough rate. 
I stopped and have realised my PTSD isn't likely to be helped by emdr or CBT. I have nothing else, but after I struggled so much with emdr I researched to see if I was the only one and it looked like it was still very much split between whether it works or doesnt. 


I hope either way you get the help you need"
