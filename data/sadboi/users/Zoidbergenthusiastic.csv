depression,fitcymi,t1_fisbu0v,1582715339.0,"Dude being scramble brained is literally physically what happens to you after you make a person and then push it out of you - don't apologise for it! 

Sounds like a good idea to see your OBGyn as they know you and are familiar with your circumstances. 

Unfortunately antidepressants can take up to three weeks to work so if your husband is after a ""quick fix"" you're right in that there isn't really one. Depression is one of those things that slowly builds up and takes time to be rid of..

So that's why that happened to me!"" Whether it's so I meet a person, get a particular job, or sometimes just be in a better position to help someone else who's going through the same thing. 

This sucks. It just sucks. But at some point you will stop crying. Who knows, maybe in 20 years you'll be a case co ordinator person and you'll be 200% better at the job because you can be entirely empathetic to the people you see. 

In the meantime please feel free to rant and cry because I agree THIS TOTALLY SUCKS AND IS UNFAIR. Keep being a good honest person. Nobody can take that from you."
depression,fis2iqe,t3_f9k23o,1582676320.0,"Hiya,

I just want to say first that you're not alone and I read this and I'm sending you so many internet hugs right now!!!

Is there a possibility of you going to see a Doctor / medical help? I'm just saying that because you're a new mum there should be PPD resources for you to take advantage of - this isn't normal but it can be made better hopefully with a little time and help.

Secondly regarding your husband, that sounds like a really tough situation. Do you have any friends / family nearby who you trust? I'm just thinking expect the best but prepare for the worst scenario here. Trust me not everyone is always on his side and I'm sorry to hear he makes it sound like he's the golden child as it were. That's not fair on you.

Lastly, please don't read this as patronising, but get a calendar. A literal hang on the wall calendar. When you get a bill put on the date. It becomes easier once you get into the habit. What you're doing right now isn't working so maybe this is a possible alternative?

Anyway I don't know if this is good advice or not but you're a good mum, a good wife, you're not alone and people care about you xxx"
