AMA,fpa18gt,t3_gc4qh3,1588438761.0,Congratulations!!! That’s a huge accomplishment. What was the most helpful for you when you’d have urges?
BPD,fp2y3h9,t3_gb0l54,1588269823.0,"I know where you’re coming from. I’ve had an almost decade long struggle with cutting. I’ve been clean for a while but the urges are getting stronger now with the quarantine. For me, I’ve noticed that the more days I go without cutting, the stronger I feel, and over time the urges lessen. Try to replace the cutting with something less harmful, such as snapping a rubber band on your wrist. Also, what I’ve found the most helpful is simple distraction. Doing ANYTHING that’ll take my mind away from those thoughts even for 5 minutes. Cook something, sleep, write, watch tv, anything that you like. The DBT TIPP skill has also been helpful for me with urges. I like to submerge my face in very cold water and I feel like it sort of resets my brain a little and puts me into a slightly different headspace. 

It does NOT have to be this way forever. This is an especially hard time with the pandemic we are dealing with, but your self harm habit and disorder are NOT who you are. You have so much support from everyone on this sub, you are cared for. If you need someone to talk to or vent to feel free to message me! You are not alone in this."

You are cared for by everyone in this sub, and we all sympathize with you. Feel free to send me a PM if you want to talk."
BPD,fo18wtu,t3_g54del,1587428162.0,"I’m in the exact same situation. I’ve relied heavily on drugs in the past, as well as partaking in other risky behaviors like unsafe sex. People have always told me I’m wise for my age, and my mental illness started early as well. I also have a lot of stuffed animals I hold during the day as comfort. I like to watch cartoons and be treated very baby like in relationships as well. I think it’s very common among us with BPD, you aren’t alone!"

BPD,fluwpde,t3_fraaor,1585511618.0,"I relate to this. Often times it’s my empty feelings or a feeling of disconnection to reality that cause me to just lash out at people close to me. Afterwards I realize what I said was out of hand, but in that moment it’s automatic and I don’t think about it like I should."
BPD,fluw2yt,t3_fraqq3,1585511246.0,"Definitely relate to this.

SBU,fgds5wh,t3_exx277,1580686232.0,"Unfortunately, pretty much the only option in terms of finding therapy on campus is CAPS, and they only offer 10 free sessions a semester. After that, you have to pay out of pocket because they don’t take insurance. Usually for any long term treatment you’d need to find somebody off campus, as CAPS is pretty much meant for dealing with short term school-related stress. There are psychiatrists available at Putnam Hall, but there is a waitlist."
SBU,fec86ab,t3_eo9ffh,1578968329.0,"I have a hard time making friends and taking to people as well, and I’ve found starting slow helps. If you have trouble being around people in general, maybe try spending some time regularly in the library doing work or watching Netflix or whatever. Maybe over time it’ll get easier as you get adjusted to it. 

Volunteering somewhere on campus may be beneficial as well, as it’s a chance to interact with others on a more surface level. Any job in general would be a great way to practice interpersonal skills!"

You can go to the meetings but don't really have any commitment if you don't like it. There are some more serious groups, like Greek life and academic organizations that might require interviews."

Thats what got me through."
