I'm not sure if this will be helpful to anyone reading but I also found to lean into the dissociation eg don't try and fight it, accept it and experience it for the meantime. Fighting it for me often makes me panic and or freak out so therefore I just try and relax as soon as possible, have an early night and forget about it.

Take it easy, don't panic, make notes of things if that helps and hopefully you can be better equipped for emotions in the future if you were a bit numbed out before :)

Thing is with these narcissists is that they believe their own lies so much, they almost become believable to ordinary people too. For instance, on that phone call to 911 when Hansen came, Greg is so convinced that it was Sarah's BPD and not that he groomed her, that he has convinced himself of that. That's why lying is easy for these people, because they believe it.

survivinginfidelity,f9fmur3,t1_f9ewgi0,1575279571.0,"What a disgusting person. So sorry to hear you've been through all that, sounds so traumatic."
survivinginfidelity,f9fmu2y,t1_f9e4vf2,1575279541.0,"I wonder what would have happened if it was the other way round. She'd do the same thing of course and be furious!

Always used to say to my ex 'I would never have done this to you'. He even tried to say he would make it work. Can't imagine it would've done.

Hope you're doing well OP! The sooner you get out of there, the sooner you feel the relief!!"
NarcissisticAbuse,f9dbxue,t3_e4mid8,1575232088.0,"I'm sorry to hear you're in that scenario. For me, what has helped me is knowing that regardless of what is said (and a lot of vile things have been said about me) is that I know the truth and can prove most of it, and people who are my friends or I would want to be would question the validity of what the Nex says.

If you just accept what someone says (even what I would say about the Nex), then that says more about you than them. I would encourage you as well to not accept everything you hear about someone similarly.

Like I say, what helped me was having consistent proof that my Nex was a Nex (cheating, violence, abuse, other people confirming this) as well as me knowing the people in my life that value me would question the validity of any claims. I blocked all the mutual friends between Nex and I that took his side regardless of cheating, violence, abuse and alleged rape. Shows their colours more than me.

Try and find a good therapist who can help build self esteem, as well as reading and finding validity in yourself. You don't need or want those people who believe those lies in your life. You've got this."
NarcissisticAbuse,f9bk5zx,t1_f9bjo7h,1575213483.0,"It wasn't the worst thing AP did to me; my Nex had told her about my past with self harm and she used that against me to say she hoped I killed myself etc.

Honestly feel like a thousand tonnes has been taken from me. A normal, peaceful life is worth so much I never even realised. My Nex pulled all the tricks in the book so I don't think any of their behaviours (nor AP) would surprise me.


I hope you find some peace soon! Reading this sub and books has been great for me. Thanks for your kind words."
NarcissisticAbuse,f9aliv2,t1_f983a8d,1575203963.0,"I told my ex he was a narcissist and his affair partner turned if round and said actually no, I was and worse than him.

Further confirmed he definitely is and there's something wrong with her regardless to still be with him (she knew everything from day one eg domestic violence, cheating)."

NarcissisticAbuse,f8zmrjj,t1_f8mkxpz,1574962466.0,Definitely start blogging! Or journalling or poetry or just prose! Your words were beautiful :)
Dissociation,f8zmhpd,t3_e30fwe,1574962406.0,"This to me definitely sounds like anxiety... I'm not sure what to suggest other than to date around/speak to more people and practice grounding exercises if possible, and to feel 'in the moment' and let things flow. 

Sometimes I find the more I focus upon 'do I really feel here' the more I zone out. Alternatively, a therapist may be more insight and there may be a reason/block for the way you feel like this. The more I relax into the autopilot/zoning out etc, the more I forget it's happening and can become present, it's when I become hyperaware that it gets worse so I would probably recommend experiencing it fully if you can."
survivinginfidelity,f8zl5ny,t1_f8yh3ue,1574961983.0,"I'm so sorry that it was turned on you that he could 'forgive' you... You don't lead someone to cheat, they can end the relationship at any time but they make a conscious decision not to and cheat.

Happy to hear you are doing better now, you deserve it :)"

NarcissisticAbuse,f8kazo3,t3_e0uqon,1574609318.0,"This is so beautifully written. Take it easy and try to continue being kind to yourself; it's not easy but I guess these kind of losses create intense grief.

Hope you are writing creatively, your thoughts were so fluid and gorgeous. Hope you find some peace and can continue to grow and flourish and move on ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Onision,f8k8whf,t1_f8iiu5t,1574608668.0,"He also was telling his ex wife he was going to commit suicide if she continued alimony payments, and then later said he had no intention of doing so and it was a manipulation technique.

Manipulation over one of the most vulnerable states someone can be in is truly an evil thing.

Onision is a textbook Narcissist to me. Having recently dealt with one in my life, the comparison and manipulation is unreal. I agree, I really hope he gets what's coming to him and they can see through his lies.
