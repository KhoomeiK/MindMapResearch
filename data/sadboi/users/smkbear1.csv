Big city life is tough and depressing 
My life is much better since I quit my job and went to a rural area

Weed is also helping a lot, try it if you are willing to take meds anyway 

Weed will at least not damage your liver and kidneys in a long run, it is not the holy grail of health and I can only speak for me and it helps a lot 

If you get anxious, don‘t ;) 
I know this is not how anxiety works 

But even if you have a little anxiety the first times it will eventually go away"

and weed my friend, at least this is how it works for me to be more outgoing, not awkward you know what I mean 

Do something together with them, you can also try to work out but that’s not for everyone 

you need to figure those out for yourself, but I would say that spending more time with loved ones and do fun things, like cooking and eating together 
If you can and want get a dog or a cat
Helps to not feel alone

edit: if something bothers you, you need to express those feelings somehow 
took me years to understand but I’m actually feeling better after I expressed them somehow, you don’t need to talk for that
you can also draw it, write it or scream it 
whatever comes to mind"

And I thought the same about religions a few years ago 
No I don’t have one now but you need something you believe in and that can be very hard to find in times of individualism 

It is a very big topic, but the main part is that you need something to believe in 

It must not be god or some prophet 
You can try and believe in yourself, as stupid as it sounds I know this 

I’m not really good at explaining emotions and it took me a while to figure out what it takes to love yourself and believe in yourself 
Family can be a very important part of this, try to have talk with them
or avoid them for a while if you can move out
But take it easy, btw you don’t need a therapist
A therapist can be very helpful don’t get me wrong, but you can learn resilience and not needing a therapist at all 
This may not apply to really bad traumatic experiences 

I basically just wanted to say, find strength in yourself and you will accomplish things you didn’t even imagine, not everything tho 
have a great day bb"
depression,epttds9,t3_bvup45,1559497196.0,"It always helped me to talk to others about it, but you have to trust - if you don’t dare to, you don’t need to talk about this with this person 

And I embraced the shadows

it is like accepting that something is wrong and you have to fix it and/or fight your shadows
The scariest enemy is always the one you don’t know or can’t see

So know your enemy, it helps me to be a lot less anxious"
