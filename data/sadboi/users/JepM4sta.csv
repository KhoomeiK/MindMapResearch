Anxiety,fqikua6,t3_fnz5n3,1589397341.0,"So...I need some advice. 

I spoke to my therapist today and I was talking about how I was angry because it felt like I have nothing left in 2020 to look forward to.

She tells me that Basically my biggest problem is I treat everything as an all or nothing scenario. Either I get exactly what I want or everything is ruined. And that’s a very unhealthy and I’m sorry for making you angry. 

However we went over solutions and this is her solution:  She has told me that if I’m really getting stir crazy, I should just drive to Knoxville...and then drive back home. Not get out of my car or anything crazy like that, but I could drive to Knoxville look around maybe pick up something to eat to take back home and then just drive back home again. 

I mean if I'm not gonna get out and do anything why should I even bother leaving the house I can just pull up YouTube and watch a video of someone driving their car for an hour and then just grab a burger from a place in town so it won’t be cold when I get back home.

I just am getting frustrated with a lot of stuff. And noww I’ve got a whole bunch of my game show fan friends that are upset that because LA County is going to be shutting down for another three months there’s not gonna be any new game shows or any new TV shows of any kind until at least 2021 end it just doesn’t seem like I have anything fun that I can do. 

If any of you have advice I’d love to hear it"

We just made it through one of the most challenging and difficult months our nation has faced in its recent history, and everyone of you reading this survived it and made it through with flying colors.

I’m going to say something that I may wind up regretting but I’m gonna say it anyway because I’m trying much harder to be positive. I firmly believe in my heart May is going to be a month of healing, I truly believe that we’re going to be seeing much more positive news this month, Then we did last month.

We have shown that we have the ability to survive and in some cases thrive in what has been a very adverse environment. This shows your dedication and it shows your strength. May is going to be a much better month of April I really believe that in my heart. So let’s begin the month of healing together, everyone of you￼ means something special to me and my heart and in my soul. Your friendship and your companionship nourishes me, and it’s high time we kick things into high gear and we begin what I really believe is going to be a month of healing.

Meaning the growth will keep happening rapidly, since those 240 people could now infect over 600 people, and so on and so forth  


HOWEVER! (As Professor Irwin Corey would say), once the R0 factor goes below 1.0, then that 100 people will NOT infect more than 100 people, meaning the rate will decrease, since eventually the number of possible infected will get smaller.  For an example, if the R0 factor is 0.8, then that mythical hundred people will only infect 80 people, that 80 will only infect 64 people and so on and so forth.  basically the virus burns out since there are no new hosts left for it to infect.  


This is highly simplified, but I hope it made sense"

>Even more encouraging, the daily infection rate trends continue to move downward as more people in the US observe social distancing, even as test rates increase dramatically.

Just to confirm, once the infection rate goes below 1, that's when the virus is on the ropes, since it will eventually burn itself out, right?"

Anxiety,fm1es3u,t3_fj2y1a,1585677095.0,"I don’t really have any news to post but I just want to post to comment. Once things are getting real when it came to this virus I remember reading all of the think pieces that came out that were so pessimistic.  The worst was by Jonathan Pie over in the UK Who said that people rushing to the store to buy toilet paper is all the proof he needed that human beings were nothing more than greedy, amoral animals with just a tiny veneer of civility. And he said that this was only the beginning of how horrible things were going to get and basically was extremely sad and depressing and dour. 

And yet, I’ve been seeing positivity happen all around the world. I’ve seen it in small companies and businesses offering free meals to little kids who can’t get their lunches at school. I’ve seen it in industries big and small offering to make N95 masks for medicine. I’ve seen it with breweries and distilleries stopping making beer and alcohol and instead making hand sanitizer. I’ve seen it in a renewed sense of cooperation and selflessness that has really taken hold in this country. 

There will always be greedy horrible people in crises, it’s easy to focus on the isolated stories of people buying entire pallets of toilet paper, people at one grocery store buying out the entire stock of meat because they want to make sure they don’t get caught short, and insidious scammers who are trying to get people to give up their credit card information or their medical details. But I firmly believe that human beings are at their heart, good. And when we are faced with a crisis the vast majority of us are going to want to help rather than hurt. Of course living in the south I see this all the time, whenever there is a hurricane we always hear stories of the “Cajun Navy” that ride into town with their personal bass boats and Jag boats as they are called, to help retrieve people from their flooded homes.

We will get through this together, it’s going to be OK, and it’s going to be because the best of us are going to overtake the worst of us. We always have and we always will. And I see that on this thread as well, everyone of you that posts these positive stories do not know the sheer level of good that you are doing.  Maybe seeing good news from around the world keeps one person from giving up hope, it keeps one person from locking themselves in their homes and just gorging themselves on junk food and simply ceasing to be.  I know that since I’m working from home and I only get to look outside the window all day, these positive stories are the sunlight that nourishes my soul.

I want to close with my favorite quote by Sir Winston Churchill. “ this is not the end, this may not even be the beginning of the end, but maybe this is the end of the beginning.“ It’s going to be OK, this too will pass."

Before I get started I want to make it clear that I am aware of how blessed I am.  Me and my family are all safe and healthy right now, and I couldn't be happier for that.  However, this month has been one of total craziness.   

I’ve had to cancel a lot of things that I was looking forward to this year. I’m not gonna be able to see my friend Cyndi have her last chemo therapy treatment like I had planned, I can’t go to see a Beatles tribute band like we had planned to celebrate with next week, there’s no sports on television, I’m under house arrest, and the only thing in my life that I have to look forward to is trivia nationals in Las Vegas on July 30th, and we all know we were going to cancel that.  


I live in Tennessee, in Campbell County, and I am about to go stir crazy with worry.  Basically, I am worried that things will always be like this, and it hurts because it feels like everything that I have in my life that I derive joy or pleasure from has been taken away from me, and it's beginning to get to me emotionally.
