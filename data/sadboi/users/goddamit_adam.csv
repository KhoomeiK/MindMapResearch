After I came back down from my manic episode, it helped me deal with my depression. However, I got to a point that it became habit. I didn't like it anymore. I didn't like how it made me feel. I finally dropped it and it helped me a lot more than I realized it would. I feel more productive. I feel like I can concentrate & I have more time in my day. I just over all feel better. And not having to worry about a piss test is always awesome. 

While THC can be helpful, it just wasn't for me after a while. My best words of advice is do NOT give into cravings. Remember *why* you're quitting and keep that posted in your head or literally on a wall or something.

I'm school, i ALWAYS had to work harder than my classmates. It made me HATE reading (which I've always loved) because i'm a slow reader. I'm bad  at math & most science just confuses me. It made me feel like I was some kind of stupid because my intelligence wasn't STEM worthy. I'm good at caring & loving people. I'm good at making people feel comfortable. That's why I've chosen to work in long term care, specifically nursing homes. Because at the end of the day, there's resident who just wants someone to talk to them & love them because their family has dumped them there & continue to pay the bill for them to live there but don't visit. They just want company & love 90% of the time. & That's where I shine. It took me my entire life to realize my lack of ""STEM intelligence"" doesn't devalue me as a person. I've been working in long term care for 2 years now & I'll never look back. Me being soft, loving, and having  a genuine want/need to care for others makes me valuable in a nursing home setting. 

I'm getting my CNA at some point. All I gotta do for that is study what they teach me, take my test, & start on the floor."
