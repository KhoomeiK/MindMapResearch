They had 4 daughters, one of which is me.

I have skin moreso like my father and have been through 10 years of dermatologists, acne specialists, etc. to find something that FINALLY worked without awful side effects.

None of my sisters nor I wore makeup at an early age. The most we wear now is maybe mascara and a lipstick for an event.

BUT all that being said, there are so many mainstream cosmetic lines that are packed with pore cloggers.
