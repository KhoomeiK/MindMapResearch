EngineeringStudents,fdnhjvb,t3_emaopy,1578585946.0,"In terms of using every possible resource, I would add a small adjustment to that and say use every possible effective resource. Certain books and videos just get the job done way better than others. My only issue at the moment is certainly not burning out while studying from multiple resources. Also, I get lost & confused in the lack of unity( as in approaching and solving a problem) between the resources. Any advice on not burning out and also not getting confused with the new resources?"
EngineeringStudents,fdktz8o,t1_fdkr6jy,1578511115.0,Thanks for the motivation :). I have a few nice video sources on ready in order to help me fully grasp its concepts. Also I'll be practicing my behind off for sure :D

Also, try to ask for advice from people who took these courses before you. Ask them what his/her study plan was, what things they would've done different. Finally, surf the web for some video lectures. A good one I could think of for Diff.eq is ""math sorcerer"" and my beloved hero ""Professor Leonard"". For Fluid mechanics you can search up hibbler's book for fluids or Dr.biddle's video series. Good luck :)"

EngineeringStudents,fc00eu8,t3_efd0k2,1577271859.0,"Let me first start by telling you what I suffer from, If you don't mind. I have Major depressive disorder, OCD and Social anxiety. Each crippling to a certain degree. I had an awful freshman and sophomore year grade wise. All thanks to the three disorders I mentioned above. I did not know I had these disorders , or let alone diagnosed them and hence the effects were in full force. With my grades on the decline and my future in the balance, I had to act fast. So ,I headed towards my local clinic and got those disorders diagnosed. From there, I declared them to my university in exchange for some much needed course accommodations & adjustments. Thankfully, those accommodations are a life saver and my grades have began to stabilize and improve. I did not try meds because I think it won't do me any better. I have heard stories about how medications can cause you to gain weight and may negatively impact your grades due to headaches, dizziness and so on. Furthermore, you may become so reliant on it that new problems of mood swings and addiction may arise. In my opinion, try therapy or talk to your university's special needs center to get accommodations and do your best to avoid medications. I considered medications myself due to how tough it became to function as a normal human being. But,  I am willing to try therapy in the near future instead of medications."

EngineeringStudents,f94qvjm,t3_e3qopx,1575098954.0,"Here's my opinion. Professor Leonard is a breathe of fresh air due to his devotion for helping you understand very well each and every example for any mathematical concept(Not just the basic examples). When I watched his whole calculus 2 & 3 series, I was able to master calculus in a way I didn't think was possible. My University lecturer wasn't that good , so PL literally saved my life. I am tired of those you tube videos which solve one or two introductory examples and call it a day. How am I supposed to understand ? Anybody can solve the basic examples. I need to see every type of concept, solved in detail. That's where PL comes and saves the day for me."
EngineeringStudents,f929k5o,t3_e36fx9,1575019343.0,I cannot emphasize enough how BLESSED we are to have him. I'm praying everyday that he finishes Diff.eq before the start of the spring semester or around that time. That's the only way I get an A . No lecturer comes even close to his skill of teaching any mathematical concept so well. Incredible guy.

EngineeringStudents,f45m8dy,t3_djaavb,1571383588.0,"Open up to your instructors. Tell them what you go through. My professors were always in full understanding when I speak to them about my symptoms of depression, anxiety or OCD. Even though, and I'll admit this,  I confuse them sometimes when I try to explain my symptoms. However, they always give me the benefit of the doubt. Also, what helped me are accommodations my university was gracious enough to offer for me. These accommodations help keep me level headed in my courses. I struggle to focus in class sometimes, so I keep a recorder with me so I can repeat the lecture to myself at home when I am a bit calmer and ready to learn. Video recording is also a good incentive. The reason I give myself to not be absent and not slack is to win against my symptoms. A good grade feels ever so sweeter when you know you kicked depression or any disorder's butt alongside with it. So yeah, Good luck!"
EngineeringStudents,f448p4q,t1_f43xlv8,1571349237.0,"Thank you so much for sharing. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to ask you about your work in the transportation sector :). Upgrades to the commuter rail systems sound super awesome.That's the beauty in civil engineering,  is how much of a service we can offer to our community.  It truly is an amazing thing to see how Civil Engineers utilize water to the benefit of our society. It's also super cool to see how we also protect our waters and keep it clean. I am definitely considering getting in on water recourses as one of my options as a soon to be Civil Engineer graduate."
EngineeringStudents,f446bga,t1_f43tcr1,1571348487.0,"Our bachelor's degree is actually more so structural engineering-oriented than anything else. However, we have about 3 courses in our university which are transportation Based. I have taken one of them and in that course, our professor gave us a project which I very much enjoyed. We basically distributed the flow of traffic to an area that had a certain population count. Despite being long, I had no problem working on it by myself( even doing my groupmates parts of the project). I am also in the process of taking the other two and am very much looking forward to them."
EngineeringStudents,f43oetj,t1_f43j41z,1571343597.0,"Yes, I landed upon it as my desired discipline while getting my Bachelor's degree. It didn't come from mass application to be honest. Just an ahead of time planning before I graduate if you will. I would prefer to work within transportation. But, I will have to see what Job opportunities are on offer. Traffic and Surveying I have become immediately attracted to and will try to intern for companies who have anything related to these two."

EngineeringStudents,evko279,t3_ck3bcf,1564584211.0,"Civil engineering grew on me by the time I reached my third year. It’s worth noting that I entered CivE absolutely hating every second of it. That hate was fueled by me being lost and not knowing what to study in university . However , By my second year , I opened my mind to it . Slowly, I started loving the challenge and topics it presented. I liked working on an Autocad steel drawing for hours and seeing it all come together at the end. I loved managing traffic volume and assigning it accordingly in my most recent transportation project. Also, I took a concrete course this past spring and it blew my mind how much science  went into concrete itself as piece of material, chemically speaking that is. Moral of the story is , give civil engineering a chance , study it with an open mind with the intent to learn it and fully understand it. If you still found yourself being dragged to study any civil engineering subject then I would guess you probably don’t like it. Sometimes,  teachers may help you  and play a role in your liking of civil engineering subjects so make sure your civil engineering tutors are likeable and fun. Anyways , good luck!"
EngineeringStudents,eumph6q,t3_cgx6fg,1563918800.0,"Some channels that helped me are : “MathTheBeautiful” & “msimps22” “Engineer4free” .

mentalhealth,eudhvfs,t3_cfk52a,1563717825.0," You said killing yourself might cause your sister to do as well. So , Why do you still want to do it? . Think about your parents as well, who might have to deal with losing their son and daughter in one go, their pain might be so hard words won’t be able to explain it. There is no way to die painless and quick, because if you die , people close to you will feel the pain you didn’t have. I completely understand where you come from . I suffer from severe depression due to emotionally abusive parents who take pride in what you do for them than what they do for me. Hang in there dude , this will all be worth it in the end."
EngineeringStudents,eu1tbki,t3_ce1vyj,1563374960.0,"I also suffer from mental illness and happen to be studying engineering. Something that keeps me motivated is me knowing my gpa , which is under a 3 , would literally be 4 times higher than it is if I didn’t have mental illness. I keep telling myself my gpa is technically way above a 3 if mentall illness wasn’t the case. And sometimes I even wonder what the smartest student’s gpa would look like if they were to go through what we went through. All in all , we can’t let our mental illnesses get the best of us. Graduating with that degree will feel ever so sweeter knowing we were battleing mental illnesses along side it. So that’s like two birds with one stone. Good luck my dude!"

Thus, I am forced by my toxic parents to bear the responsibility of doing well academically to bring ""income"" to the family. Yet,  my parents refuse to believe my Dependancy on them is due to a serious disorder. Instead, they think it's me being lazy and fearful to try and overcome the disorder. I, unfortunately, live with my parents l because I can't live or rely on my own due to my parents raising me to rely on them and due to our shitty financial situation.

You probably have family that care about you and love you, taking yourself out will put them In permanent pain. I had those thoughts too, but the reason I don’t listen to them is because I can’t let depression win. Personally, My parents are the main cause to all my issues. Yet, I will be the better person and let them not suffer the pain of my suicide. I still am a burden to them but not as much as i could be if I killed myself. I have severe depression as well the kind to make every minute pure torture, but music and isolation sort of help me manage. Hope this helps."
