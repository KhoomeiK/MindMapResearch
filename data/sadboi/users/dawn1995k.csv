CESB,fr3l8cu,t1_fr39o3h,1589859868.0,"This is exactly what happened. 

If you take a look at the definition of “disability” in terms of attempting to access AISH/OSAP/any other relevant financial aid, you will notice that the language is different. In order to qualify your disability needs to be permanent (which is not necessarily the case for mental illnesses, which can flare up and cause devastating consequences, still, and many are episodic so do not qualify) and if they are technically “treatable” (which most mental illnesses technically are treatable through means of therapy and/or medication but there is no cure and treatments do not work for everyone) you also don’t qualify. Points to note: 

A) The disability tax credit was never mentioned at all in the section regarding disabilities for CESB (again, really hard to qualify for, especially for many who face stigma and difficulty with mental illness). If they required this as a criteria to be eligible for the extra amount, they would have mentioned this. They have made the criteria broad for a reason, as they don’t want to exclude those with disabilities 

B) The criteria and definition of disability has been broadened as mentioned, again, not to exclude and face issues of discrimination since the goal really is to help Canadians quickly and the government did mention they accounted for a small % of fraudulent claims. It begins with “any impairment,”, quickly opening the door for interpretation - also mentioned is “physical, mental, communicative, sensory, or other functional limitation, whether permanent or episodic, evident or not” - this encompasses mental illnesses that typically wouldn’t be included in the definition of disability. This pandemic has had a horrible impact on the mental health of everyone, especially those with mental illness. The term “functional limitation” would likely cover those who are either immunocompromised or otherwise high-risk, or those who live with someone who is, as the end of the definition states that the disability or impairment or limitation must hinder one’s “full and equal participation in society” - in your case, because of the dangers of COVID-19 and the risk of your loved one’s health, you are unable to participate fully or equally. 

The Conservatives pushed very hard for the attestation of job-seeking for students, likely because we are not their voter demographic. Concessions had to be made due to our minority government, and the concessions had to be made quickly to get the program rolled out in a timely manner. The NDP wanted everyone to receive $2000 and make the CERB universal, which likely would’ve been cheaper and way more effective at this point. They ended up winning as the amount for students with dependents and disabilities (which includes way more now as the definition is SO broad) was increased - although the base amount remained $1250, since almost all students can claim the higher amount, almost everyone will receive $2000. 

The Cons wanted the job bank added in. The NDP wanted a universal benefit. Trudeau wanted his original proposal to remain unchanged. Everyone made their concessions but in the end the Cons did lose."
Edmonton,fr30lqm,t1_fr23aov,1589847546.0,"Perhaps, but nothing has really stopped people from coming here prior to this weekend from elsewhere as provincial parks and campgrounds were opened in Alberta at the beginning of May. People could have been coming to and from here for the last three weeks with nothing to stop them, so it’s not really a good way to judge it. What we will see is whether or not people have *actually been distancing* for the last couple of months when businesses are allowed to slowly open. I don’t think a lot of people are actually travelling greater distances than they normally would just to sit on a patio to be served by someone in a mask. 

If anything, people have been flocking to places like Kananaskis since there aren’t really a whole lot of provincial parks in Alberta with much scenery or things to do for families and such. Once the national parks open is when we are likely to see a surge in cases as places like Banff and Jasper draw TONS of people, even if the towns themselves have restrictions in place."

Not saying it isn’t an issue and there aren’t more cases out there, but Alberta has been aggressively testing anyone with symptoms now for about 2 weeks and there hasn’t been any crazy surges since they changed that. 

Everyone remember that the numbers they give you are TOTAL CUMULATIVE cases, not ACTIVE ones, which is really the number people should be focusing on if we are to be implementing the whole contact tracing thing.

I always ring my bell to give people enough time to move to the right should it be necessary, as a courtesy thing.

Not risking my life so that pedestrians don’t have to pay attention whatsoever, lol. I will always ride on the grass if needed or get off to let people pass if the sidewalk has a lot of traffic, but I agree with you.

Edmonton,fqvz171,t1_fqsvhhj,1589688484.0,"The main reason restrictions are being lifted is because the government and health officials have determined that the number of cases in conjunction with the current and predicted trends will not pose a strain on the healthcare system. This is based on the predicted hospitalizations required and the average amount per case can be used to analyze this. Also how many will require ICU and ventilation is carefully predicted and monitored. 

Businesses have been able to survive (somewhat) by pivoting their business model to curb side pickup, delivery, etc... this has worked for many who weren’t really able to have a lot of traffic inside anyhow. It is hard for some. But the main reason for any of these restriction changes, current and future, depends on the predicted impact on the healthcare system."

I feel like they are trying to use the May Long weekend as a sort of test to see how well people are continuing to follow social distancing measures upon the launch of Stage 1. I definitely think that it does carry a lot of risk, though. If there is a significant surge in cases, we could end up in the same situation as Calgary with restrictions still in place."
gamecollecting,fqvvkns,t3_gkvjm5,1589686169.0,WHAT!
Edmonton,fqvvilw,t1_fqtv6z4,1589686133.0,"1. I just didn’t double-check my numbers. Can’t remember exactly what the minimum wage was, but I was definitely being paid at least the minimum + tips (for cleaning tables). 

You can, but it isn’t typically doable for many to earn the living wage or more when expenses are taken into account. And while what you say may be true (that entry-level jobs are not meant to be forever), many students are in these jobs while going through school and many people that wait tables, for example, work those jobs long-term as tips can boost your wage by quite a bit. 

And I do not know what types of jobs you have applied for *recently*, as there are pretty much zero that will pay $30 (double min) without a certificate at least. Simply not the case anymore that it went up. (In AB it is $15 at least). The highest I have seen (applied for a LOT of jobs) without a post-secondary requirement in the last year or so has been $22-$23 an hour. Better, but still barely enough. 

In Alberta they have passed legislation that workers under 18 can be paid $13 minimum rather than the $15. I totally understand how things work. Thing is, they risk losing the stream of support staff they need by doing this and the majority of restaurants have not done this/don’t employ minors to begin with. I’m in HR and I completely understand how this works lol. The law is absolutely ridiculous. If high school students want to do an adult thing by getting a job, they should be paid the same wage."
Edmonton,fqtsg13,t1_fqtm14z,1589645211.0,"1. I started working my first restaurant job in 2011. Minimum wage was around $7/hr. 

2. You don’t seem to understand what I mean when I say these places are being “cheap”. First of all, $15/hour is still lower than the actual living wage, which has been calculated to be closer to $18/hour - living wage meaning enough for the average person to be able to pay their basic living expenses (rent, utilities, groceries). You must be old, if you aren’t in touch whatsoever with how high the cost of living has become. It is no longer 1950. Inflation is a thing. $15/hour today doesn’t get you any further than $3/hour would have back then (likely would have gotten you further actually, as now in order to get any job that pays more you have to have at least one year minimum at post-secondary whereas the Boomer generation did not attend university/college at the same volume). 

3. Paying two people different wages for doing the exact same job is literally illegal in other circumstances. It’s called discrimination on the basis of age. If a 15-year-old kid chooses to get a job working retail or whatever else, why should they be paid $2/hour less than an 18-year-old doing the exact same job, that requires the same skill set and effort? A little dehumanizing, don’t you think? I worked my ass off in high school cleaning tables, and was told by many that my effort and performance was better than some adults working in similar minimum wage positions. It is complete bullshit, and reflects highly on the values of a company."
canada,fqtlhcx,t1_fpeblpb,1589641316.0,"Another reason why students are feeling insulted because they are being suggested to take all of these farm jobs that are currently unable to be filled by TFW’s due to the pandemic, when those workers are treated as disposable shit and paid less than minimum wage - farmers don’t even WANT to hire students when they would all need to be trained, many are completely unsuitable for farm work and they would have to pay at least minimum wage if not higher to get people who are more qualified for other lines of work to come work on a farm.

Check out the info on the CRA website to double check when you can apply, as I believe high school students are only eligible for two of the periods as the assumption is that you would not be working until at least June-July, regardless if there was a pandemic. 

They asked if you were a student who meets the enrolment/graduation requirements. They also asked if you had a disability or were caring for a dependent. You had to attest that you had not already received CERB. Also that you are seeking work but unable to find it/unable to work due to COVID-19 etc. That was about it.

I mean, our semesters were completely upheaved in the middle of March so abruptly that I still have an ice coffee I accidentally left in my locker the Friday before classes were cancelled, lmao. The transition to online delivery was NOT smooth in any way, which we knew would likely be the case as everyone had to adapt, but the courses I was in were completely group-based and required a lot of direct interaction and with everyone experiencing various issues due to the pandemic with work and kids and whatever else, it was just a gong-show. Not to mention on top of having to deal with that, our grades we worked our asses off for (for most people as far as I know in Canada) don’t count towards our GPA for the Winter term. It was hard as fuck to motivate myself for that last two months. 

Also, tuition is slated to go up 7% this Fall term where I’m attending. Ridiculous considering we likely will be online again, hopefully they will take this time to improve upon the online delivery but I doubt it will be worth the same or be as effective as the in-person lectures we paid for. Some online courses are okay for me but a lot of people just cannot learn the same online, especially when libraries are closed and you have to be essentially in your home concentrating on schoolwork. Fucks with a lot of people who live in rural areas with shitty Internet as well. I feel like we have gotten kinda screwed over and a LOT of students will still be unable to attend in Fall for so many reasons that we shouldn’t have to feel guilty about taking the CESB. Not saying that people should just take it and not work because of that, but there are many who feel it is not worth the risk if they don’t have a reliable job to go back to and it would be completely temporary and likely part-time for a few months anyway."

They will be auditing very few individuals with this and not penalizing those who applied thinking they were eligible (or told they were by an agent who was uninformed) - just requiring a repayment which will happen over a period of time if necessary."
CESB,fqs87d9,t1_fqr4eb0,1589600723.0,"This is true, but I can confirm from a CRA employee who focuses on audits (no specifics on who/what) but that audits on individuals are actually rarely ever done. It has to be a HUGE red flag that you have committed a large amount of fraud before they will actually take the time to audit an individual thoroughly. They have no interest in clawing back money from students who are struggling and likely barely making enough to get by as is. Definitely helpful to have information on hand as a contingency plan, but the CRA focuses their auditing efforts on businesses and corporations in particular as it is much easier for them to evade tax laws and such."
CESB,fqs80dy,t1_fqqiz8t,1589600600.0,"Pretty sure the entire thing about the job bank and attestation about looking for work was added in just to appease the cons, particularly Scheer who just wouldn’t give up on it and wouldn’t support the bill if it wasn’t there. Even in the bill itself it only mentions that as a condition of this benefit, students would be provided with opportunities through a job bank - there is no actual requirement to register for this, as students cannot be forced into doing work they aren’t qualified for or feel unsafe doing, or are not feasibly able to access. 

Indeed would work too. But they will be focusing primarily on the huge issue with people applying for CERB with Service Canada first and then applying again through CRA, etc or people who have applied who are clearly not eligible whatsoever (no proof of any income/being a student, which is on your tax return and can be accessed via your SIN). 

But yes. They will not have the means or the time to audit every single student. They pretty much have no real will to do so, anyhow. CRA agents have been instructed to process every claim EVEN if they think it may be fraudulent, unless the incident is extreme or the individual is already flagged, etc. I know a couple of CRA employees and they have all blatantly stated that this is essentially a handout and that the government has stated that the small % of fraudulent claims was planned as it was necessary to roll out funds quickly. Kind of does open the door for people applying who are not eligible but I can’t see that many people being dumb enough to apply if they haven’t been working or have no means at all of even arguing eligibility since you will be required to pay the entire amount back."

I do believe they said it should be within 2-3 business days though!

Even CRA agents themselves aren’t completely familiarized with all of the ins and outs. 

Also, I cannot see why the government would bother wasting time and resources clawing back money from students when even Trudeau has mentioned that the very few fraudulent applications were something the government “greatly accepted” because if they had taken the time to implement checkpoints at each turn, it would have taken literally months for Canadians to receive help they needed immediately as nobody really predicted the severity of COVID-19. Because there are very few in this situation who would fraudulently claim CESB, they likely will not be very stringent on the job searching efforts here. It would be helpful to either have an account with a job search site like Indeed where you can track jobs you have viewed and applied for, or register for the government Job Bank - there is no requirement to do so to be eligible for benefits, it was only specified in the bill passed by the government that students would be made “aware of opportunities in the form of a government job bank” (which already existed, by the way). 

Also, job search-related activities will also count, just document them (doesn’t need to be super detailed. They literally just want to see *some* effort should they come looking, but they a) cannot force students to work jobs they aren’t qualified for/are completely out of their field/feel unsafe doing due to COVID-19, and b) are unable to actually scrutinize all of these applications. Things like creating a resume and cover letter, doing career-orientation quizzes online, even browsing for jobs is listed in job search activities with regards to EI."
CESB,fqs0s3n,t1_fqrx9t9,1589596024.0,"Yeah the literal definition of disability for CESB is there. It’s meant to be broad. I felt guilty applying for the extra amount and I have severe anxiety and depression but can still kinda get by mind you it’s a large struggle, but am not technically eligible for disability as it is very stringent. They made this broad for a reason. The NDP wanted everyone to get $2000, this is the closest they could get to that by broadening this definition for this benefit. Otherwise they would’ve mentioned the DTC or required documentation right there."
CESB,fqs0l83,t1_fqrv7u0,1589595905.0,Yes the definition is not the same!! Note how it says when you apply - definition as disability as it relates to THIS benefit.

They have broadened it so as to not discriminate.
CESB,fqr9q6v,t1_fqr4z6e,1589580227.0,"Thank you for getting an answer from the CRA on this!! It’s so hard to have a mental illness recognized as a disability sometimes due to technicalities even though it does severely impact your life, sometimes all you really have to show for that is your experience since mental illnesses are complex and not always evident. Also the definition does include episodic so I assume it’s been broadened as well. Super appreciate your answer though!! I have been being treated by a psychiatrist for the last couple of years for severe anxiety/depression and although I may not technically qualify for the disability tax credit or AISH (in my province) my doc can completely attest to the impact it has had on my life and my ability to handle even going to work."

I would register for the Job Bank as a start and even just apply for a few random jobs... it just has to look like you didn’t purposely not look for work, really. They can’t really prove how hard you looked so long as you say that you did and provide some proof. Even if you use websites such as Indeed and provide screenshots of jobs you have applied to or write them down, that will be sufficient. But they really aren’t looking for this too much as they have other concerns to deal with, such as actual fraudulent claims. 

The attestation attached to the CESB was literally only put in there to appease the feds, particularly Scheer, who wouldn’t shut his yap about it and since Trudeau needs their support he had to make that concession by adding it in there. I thought you would be either automatically registered in or would have had to make an account with the government job bank upon applying, but they don’t even make you do that. Kinda indicates that it was only put in there to appease the Cons and nothing more. There really are not that many jobs out there, and the competition for jobs in there is fierce even when the economy is booming. It’s a joke. 

If you check out the bill that was passed, the language only specified that the government would provide students with job opportunities, etc through a job bank. Not that students would be required to use it or register with it, but it is an easier way to prove your job search and will likely cause them to skim over you, really."
CESB,fqqt1b5,t1_fqqluu3,1589571434.0,"Another option in this case should you so wish if you have an illness that impacts your life is to give your doctor consent to release your medical information. This includes any diagnoses/medications/information relating to the impact on your life should you apply for income support/disability/etc. This way should you need to provide documentation, you are able to request this from your doctor. If it does impact your life in such a way that you have been having issues finding work (and therefore being able to either currently bring in an income or qualify for the $2000 CERB) you fall under the definition of disability. 

So long as the doctor who diagnosed your condition can attest to the impact it has had on your life - for example for me, I have been unable to work for the last year and a half due to severe anxiety and PTSD, and I still deal with the issues although I am being treated, they still affect my life to a great degree and definitely impacted my ability to work last year and this year. 

There is no requirement that you be receiving the disability tax credit to be eligible for the disability amount for CESB. They would have noted that in the definition, which was made to be broad on purpose - many were pushing for the $2000 CERB to be universal, so by broadening this definition, most students will be receiving the $2000 amount."
CESB,fqqsee6,t1_fqqmb0r,1589571110.0,"My suggestions or you would be to, if you can, seek help from a doctor who will be able to refer you to a psychiatrist. I have the same issues (severe anxiety/panic attacks and depression) but have been seeing and being treated by the same psychiatrist (and therapist) for a couple of years now who has my consent to release my medical information in these types of situations - I was trying to apply for income support before but it is a hassle trying to access other types of services with mental illnesses, even if they really do severely impact your ability to hold a job. I believe that it why the definition of disability with regards to this benefit has been broadened - the government doesn’t want to/doesn’t have to deal with people claiming that their disability was excluded due to technicalities, many of the same which prevent those with mental illnesses from accessing services such as OSAP/AISH/the disability tax credit. Anywho. I would recommend doing this and having them provide you with a diagnosis and explain to them how it impacts your life. My psych because she has been treating me for about three years now can attest to my condition and how it has impacted my life and ability to function normally, even though I have never applied for disability due to the huge stigma and difficulty others have had. 

So long as you have documentation, you will be fine. The government is not trying to penalize those who have legitimate issues that affect their lives (especially during a pandemic, which is affecting everyones mental health) and are looking for those who are going out of their way to be fraudulent. It is well known that receiving disability benefits is difficult with mental illnesses especially many that are not as commonly recognized. Note how the definition mentions “permanent OR episodic” - for most other technical criterion, I believe only the term permanent is used. Hence why many with mental illnesses are unable to qualify."

Seems like a LOT of people had assumed that all stores would be re-opening today just because they are legally allowed to. A lot have decided they need more time to prepare with regards to the new restrictions, many have had to lay off employees that they either cannot re-hire for financial or other reasons. IMO it’s smart to wait it out for a week or so if you can feasibly do so to see what the volume seems to be like for shopping. Otherwise stores will continue to just lose money."

CESB,fqpswag,t1_fqpqmkk,1589553366.0,"I am pretty sure that is why the definition of disability “as related to this benefit” - the fact that statement is on there indicates that there is a different set of criterion for the definition of disability as related to services such as AISH or to receive the disability tax credit. If you’re struggling really really hard but can still manage to live your life, they consider it to be a non-issue even though it’s just as bad as someone trying to walk with a leg that doesn’t move. It is an insane struggle for those with mental ailments to receive even income support. 

Makes sense that the definition for CESB would technically include those who are immunocompromised because technically because of COVID-19 that impairment does hinder their full and equal participation in society. Same with those who have severe anxiety or any other type of mental illness that causes strife - things are already difficult right now and if the government were to have to deal with the issue of excluding those with disabilities based on the same technicalities, it would be a disaster. 

The NDP wanted the CERB to be made universal so all students would receive $2000. They had to make the concession that the top-up be given only to students with disabilities or with dependents. The Cons wanted the benefit to be directly tied to a job bank (which by the way is not required to apply, although I would recommend having some sort of way to prove you are looking, even an Indeed account would suffice). They ended up making the concession of the definition of disability for CESB being so broad that it essentially results in the majority of Canadians getting $2000. Really, the NDP and Libs won here. If you have an impairment as described in the definition given, you are eligible - many students with severe mental illnesses that are documented but don’t qualify for disability have been asking this question.

They won’t penalize anyone for taking money they didn’t qualify for as there are MANY areas open for interpretation here. If anything they will ask you for documentation of your disability (so if it is a mental illness, a letter from your psych attesting your condition and the impact on your life would be enough) and if they don’t find that sufficient you will be required to pay back the $750 next year. I highly doubt they will try to come after people for that, though, or try and say that your documentation of your illness isn’t good enough. Everyone needs help right now and the system is so overwhelmed with claims and will be for the foreseeable future, so there are some relaxations that have been made."

Edmonton,fqprcr1,t1_fqo0ury,1589552529.0,"Everyone needs to remember that the entire basis of the re-opening of the economy is directly linked to how many cases there are and how many hospitalizations are required. It is all linked to the modelling of how the current situation will impact our healthcare system. At this point, healthcare professionals have determined that the risk of the healthcare system being overwhelmed by the re-opening of businesses in Stage 1 is low and that is why they can open. It really has nothing to do with the general population’s well-being at all. It is based on the capacity of the healthcare system and the max the government has determined can be feasibly supported in the hospitals or in ICU. If cases surge and there is a chance that the system could be overwhelmed again, restrictions will go back in place. It would be way better for everyone involved to wait to re-open a bit longer and not have to go backwards."
Edmonton,fqpqzgk,t1_fqo5mft,1589552327.0,"I’m wondering how many stores will actually be able to re-open with restrictions in place considering how insanely high the rent is at WEM. No idea if they have received any relief on that. But it is likely that many of the smaller stores in the malls will have no choice to close down simply because they can’t afford to pay rent. 

Also, how can WEM possibly have all of the stores open and maintain physical distancing within the mall (even with a few open, how can the traffic even be monitored? The mall brings thousands of people per DAY in the summer, mind you, with peak tourism)."
Edmonton,fqpqrv5,t1_fqoiav9,1589552213.0,"I don’t think talking about a second wave is necessarily fear-mongering. If you look at literally every pandemic we’ve dealt with, there has been a second and even a third wave. Obviously we have more technology at our disposal now and are able to deal with it more effectively than say, the Spanish Flu, but if we removed all of our knowledge of medicine and technologies, COVID-19 would be just as bad as or worse than the Spanish Flu on our population. You can’t compare numbers without taking into account differences in population and other mitigating factors when discussing the severity. But the fact that it spread so quickly and so severely is a problem. Many countries in Europe who have already started easing restrictions have reported surges in cases. Many are reporting people being re-infected. Once travel restrictions ease, there will be a second wave. That is what people are confused about... because we are gradually opening the provinces and travel is basically last on the list, people think that everything will be okay by then, when in reality, as soon as we start to see international travel again we will have a second wave. 

I agree that not all articles have to be negative, but we definitely need to be aware of the possibility *and likelihood* that this is not the worst of it."
Edmonton,fqppzy6,t1_fqpp504,1589551791.0,"It should be, you’re right.

BC had a much easier time in general flattening their numbers down, so it might have something to do with that. Not sure though. They definitely seemed to have it more under control.

Edmonton,fqpn203,t1_fqopvkg,1589550112.0,"Agreed! I won’t lie, this pandemic has caused me a lot of anxiety and definitely has exacerbated my mental illnesses. Obviously I have been going to therapy, talking with friends, trying to exercise, etc. A lot of people feel this way and miss their friends, miss going out, whatever... but people don’t get that the only reason we have been able to get to this point is through the essential lockdown of society’s normal operation for 2 months, there is no vaccine, there is no treatment, the only thing we can possibly do to control the spread is to continue physical distancing as much as possible. 

We definitely could have it worse too... there are parts of me that sometimes wish we only had access to updates from health professionals as opposed to ALL of the information about everything all the time especially now, but we have so many ways to connect and to conduct business/take classes, etc online that we should be making better use of it rather than finding ways to skirt the rules on distancing or open up too early. 

I was already somewhat of a hermit anyway before all of this happened, so nothing really has changed in my social life. I have a few close friends and that’s about it, one or two I have seen in person since this has happened but otherwise nobody else really. I’m almost adjusted to this way of life and I’m worried that with all of this rush to re-open even though we don’t really know what our second wave will be like once people can travel again it’ll just be another shit-show to adjust to and deal with. So many impatient people, though. Just have to get back to the malls even though online shopping has been a thing for awhile.

Unfortunately here we are placed in another situation in which we are supposed to trust people to do the right thing which is to avoid non-essential travel and to stay home while sick, but as has been shown over and over since this pandemic began, we can’t trust people to protect the lives of others. I mean, the only reason why Calgary has been so overrun with cases compared to Edmonton is because their airport was designated for international travel whereas ours in Edmonton has only been receiving limited domestic flights. Everyone who got diverted to Calgary had to find other arrangements to get home which means more contact with people/places, also stops on the way home from the airport at gas stations and grocery stores is also a huge point of spread if someone doesn’t know they have it."
Calgary,fqplygm,t1_fqojdeb,1589549438.0,"I definitely feel bad for them but at the same time, the number of businesses who seemed to forget that if anything were to go wrong or if case numbers were to surge that the re-opening would be rolled back and went full-blown into open mode is astounding. I understand that a lot of these restaurants are small businesses just trying to survive but most restaurant owners I know were planning to start with a small-scale opening (even with 50% capacity) just to see what the volume would be like and to better establish measures that go along with the regulations that were just given only 3 days ago.

I am really shocked as to why the city of Calgary and the province had not communicated the need to push back re-opening in Calgary/Brooks because of the increased cases. This should have happened later than now across the entire province IMO but it should have been obvious for awhile now that they wouldn’t be able to open as quickly since they have literally quadruple the cases in Edmonton. These businesses shouldn’t have been given this news last-minute, they should never have had the opening date at all yesterday. Screwed a LOT of people over."
Edmonton,fqplfbv,t1_fqo16sc,1589549108.0,"A lot of businesses that have “re-opened” were already open in the first place but just not to the public, and are now essentially operating the same way as before with people waiting outside but now they are allowed to have a few people in the store. For small businesses that were offering curb side pickup already, this is honestly just a hassle for them at this point having to worry more about the PPE issue and whatnot just to have a little bit of foot traffic. I think a lot of people in general are a bit wary about things opening so soon and are waiting to see what comes of this in a couple of weeks.

Sucks because Edmonton was actually doing really well with flattening the curve, last I checked we were at something like 500 cases, with most not in the general community. No way to stop Calgarians from coming here though, the malls are open even though it looks like most stores are waiting to open/seeing if they are even able to re-open.

The pandemic hasn’t exactly been helping with it either. Lol. But yes we are lucky that mental illnesses are being more recognized as debilitating, because they so can be.

A lot of people with mental illnesses though that severely impact their lives find it extremely hard to qualify for the disability tax credit and/or AISH. So I am hoping that documentation from a psychiatrist attesting that your illness has impeded your ability to find/do work, etc will be enough in that situation. The criteria for either of those things is fairly stringent and many if not most people with mental illnesses fall into the cracks. I think that is why the definition of disability regarding CESB is more broad, and it has been confirmed with CRA that you don’t have to be eligible for the tax credit to receive the top-up, so likely documentation should suffice if there isn’t any technical proof within the system that you are disabled. Up until now, I have been fortunate enough to not require additional aid due to family supports as the process for applying is frustrating, long and often futile for mental illness issues, so this is my first time really addressing the issue in this manner."

Depending on the circumstances you might not qualify based on technicalities even if it causes you issues. It is a long and strenuous process. Not worth it for some who *can* manage but would appreciate the help. They made the definition for CESB broad intentionally it seems so they don’t exclude those with disabilities based on technicalities.

I am glad to hear that the definition was made broad on purpose as many people with mental disabilities are not recognized normally. I was worried that if I applied yet didn’t have a registered disability or wasn’t receiving AISH that I would be considered lying even though I am being treated by a psychiatrist and have been diagnosed which she is able to document should I require."

Yeah, I feel bad because I know there are others out there with far more severe issues. My mental illness has prevented me from working in the last year or so though, my psychiatrist can attest to this. I really could use the extra $ as working a job in a completely unfamiliar field might be a bit too much to handle right now at this point in time."
CESB,fqkhqno,t1_fqjvr6r,1589427563.0,"Based on what I’ve read I think so. I don’t know if it will be different in different provinces regarding the administration of the job bank, but from what people have been saying and what is written in the bill itself is that the application will be similar to the one for CERB with I think 3-4 “attestations” - mentioned elsewhere on this thread in more detail - if you’re a student, if you have not already received CERB, if you’re looking for work and I believe if you have a disability/dependent and would qualify for the higher amount. 

It does mention that you should have some sort of documentation on hand to prove it IF they come looking (which isn’t likely, as it is barely enforced with EI and there are waaaaay more claims in the system right now than the CRA can even deal with hence why the issues will be dealt with later, if at all). So I would recommend registering with the job bank and having a resume/CV on hand, but I don’t think they can force anyone to work. Just essentially legislation that had to be added to appease the Cons. I am assuming that similar to EI there will be conditions regarding suitable employment as obviously not everyone can do jobs that require physical labour, or be able to commute or scheduling issues, etc. There are quite a few loopholes for this with EI and with the huge volume in the system I highly doubt they will be able to enforce it. They will not come back later for people to see if they were actually job searching as this is nearly impossible to track, they are only looking for those who applied and didn’t meet the criteria at all... like if someone applied for CERB but had no income or job at all but got it because the system was meant to process all applications no matter what to distribute it as quickly as possible. I presume with the CESB they will be most concerned with students who claim both benefits, as I do believe that you could technically do so and receive both. It is one of the attestations but obviously there are loopholes in the system. I would not recommend doing that, obviously, if you don’t qualify you will be required to pay it back next year at tax time and likely with added interest. They’ll be looking for situations in which people have claimed periods for the benefit in which they were earning too much income to qualify as this can be tracked (but this is fairly deep digging, there are a lot of students, and it won’t happen to everyone if at all really, and not unless it was an extreme case and I highly doubt any student would be making so much more with the lack of jobs out there)."
CESB,fqjve2w,t1_fqjn9d9,1589415755.0,Lol so you got lucky? Fuck off dude. Everyone who said may 11 and may 13 was also wrong. People were told by agents to apply for CERB and then pay it back later once details came out. ?? So much misinformation went out and it’s not even really a trust thing so much as a “shut up until it’s confirmed” because shit travels fast thing. That’s all. But fuck you very much.
CESB,fqj7cl9,t1_fqinxwp,1589406041.0,"I’m confused - unless things have changed a lot in the last 7 years since I graduated, don’t all high school students receive their high school diplomas in June? Who gets to now graduate early in May? Is it because the diploma exams were waived?"
CESB,fqj7251,t3_gfuzvh,1589405928.0,"In the documents it says that “students are only eligible for one top-up of $750 per month”. 

Does this mean that if you have a disability or a dependent, you can only receive the $2000 for one of the qualifying periods, and only get $1250 for the other ones? That seems a bit unfair if that is the case. 

I know I will also likely get torn apart for asking this, but due to mental health issues I gave my psychiatrist consent to release any necessary medical information if I needed to access for example, income support. Would this information be enough to be eligible for that top-up? I do actually have quite severe anxiety that makes many job environments really hard for me to work in while staying healthy, especially with all of this pandemic stuff on top. Just wondering as they haven’t really been clear on that, other than that students don’t need documents when applying but should have them on hand if they are requested. 

Does that mean that they will for sure be requested? Or that it is a maybe, and you should have them just in case? (Obviously I have access at any time, but just a question to be ready for this)."
CESB,fqihoa9,t1_fqidkn8,1589396130.0,If you register for the job bank that’s enough. It’s just a means of providing you with jobs in the area (which I checked there’s like none where I’m at lmao) and you can apply for them through it too. That’s all
CESB,fqhrmg2,t3_gfuzvh,1589383016.0,"Trudeau just confirmed that students and recent graduates can begin applying for the CESB beginning Friday. They recommend you have your CRA Login Account ready to go for when applications open. 

SO glad they finally gave us a date. I know it wasn’t that much longer than CERB from receiving Royal Assent but they mentioned it so long ago that it just feels like it has been forever."
CESB,fqhqqi6,t1_fqhq84t,1589382497.0,"I guess. I have just seen a TON of speculation on opening days/misinformation being given by agents over the phone who are likely just as confused as we are, and after the whole May 11th fiasco I just think we shouldn’t be posting dates if they haven’t been confirmed. Trudeau is supposed to speak today about the aid package for students so we will see the updates after he speaks. I just know it is getting to be anxiety-inducing for myself as well as others when people get information from the CRA that is different from each person and none of it has been confirmed yet and then post it everywhere even though it hasn’t been confirmed at all. Lol."
CESB,fqhppai,t1_fqho2n7,1589381898.0,"Yep. The cons have forgotten that while many people receiving the benefit definitely do need it, many are also high-school students living with their parents who maybe worked weekends and are now making $2000 a month, which is likely more than they were making beforehand and definitely more than they could make this summer in this job market. Not saying they don’t deserve it for working a job as a teen, but they don’t really need the help as much as some others do who are waiting on the lesser amount. It is frustrating."
CESB,fqhpf6g,t3_gfuzvh,1589381735.0,"https://apple.news/A_Zj8bTg1QDamHFibHcRGDQ

Mentioned in this link that Trudeau will speak about students today, possibly: 

“The prime minister is also expected to expand on the $9 billion aid package for students which passed Parliament during the last round of emergency sittings. Another is slated for Wednesday afternoon.”"
CESB,fqhnnew,t1_fqhmyt2,1589380689.0,They don’t help though just creates more anxiety. Clearly we can’t trust the agents.
CESB,fqhl28i,t1_fqhf1o7,1589379145.0,"Yeah I don’t believe this sorry, I had 2 family members at the CRA tell me the 11th and it wasn’t true. So. Can people stop posting this unless it’s an OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT UPDATE? Thanks."
CESB,fqg0b0p,t1_fp8mqn5,1589335281.0,Nah it’s better to apply for jobs you know you can’t do or won’t get so you can show you have applied but haven’t refused any offers.
CESB,fqg06g6,t1_fp7rbvq,1589335207.0,"Lol there’s still the fallback, the reason why these benefits were created I thought, just say you are sick and have to isolate. Boom. Now even if you are hired, you qualify for CERB all of a sudden since you “lost employment due to COVID”. Tests aren’t required by employers so there’s the other thing you can and many students will do. Absolutely ridiculous. Also why don’t they understand how insulting it is to expect students pursuing specialized, difficult professions to replace workers who are abused and treated like shit? What about the massive amounts of high schoolers who worked barely part time jobs and are now making $2000 a month tax free with no incentive to do shit?"
CESB,fqfzwvx,t1_fp0wvph,1589335053.0,Make yourself seem extremely physically unqualified. It isn’t super hard to purposely fuck up an interview.
