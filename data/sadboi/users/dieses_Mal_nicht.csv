Feel free to call them, they are all very friendly and only want to help you. It’s included in your tuition so you might as well use it.

Edit: if your health insurance covers it, you’d probably get better treatment outside of txst. I’m just very thankful for it as a recourse since i can’t afford it otherwise."

Don’t believe any creams that claim they’ll lighten the hyper-pigmentation. Either it’s tear through (depressed area of skin casting a shadow) or hyper pigmentation.

After everything we've been through together, all the love and support I showed you, now you act like I never existed. You may think this is hypocritical of me because I haven't spoken to you either. But it's not my job to fix what you broke. You wanted me out of your life so I'm respecting your decision and giving you space.

You'll always be my first love and that fact saves a special place in my heart, and my story, just for you. But I also need to move on and accept that it's over. I still have love for you and I wish you only the best. I hope you wish the same for me."
ExNoContact,fl1qi3p,t1_fl0o5v0,1584734213.0,"I guess that makes sense. It's like you want the relationship to last forever when it's going well and you assume that those feelings will last but you can't know for sure how you're going to feel tomorrow.

I know he didn't do it on purpose to hurt me. And I know that he was disappointing too (he cried with me when we broke up). I have good and bad days. I made this post during one of my bad days of course, but I'm already feeling better after getting it off my chest. I love having access to this platform where I can express myself honestly to strangers without fear of judgement because I'm hiding behind a screen.

Thank you for telling me what it was like from your perspective as the person saying those extreme statements. I'm glad you're more careful with that stuff now.
