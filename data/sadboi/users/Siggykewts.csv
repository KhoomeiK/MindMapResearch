psychotherapy,fqs67uo,t3_gkjswi,1589599436.0,"I work in both worlds at the same time so I feel your pain.

I am generally not adverse to taking whoever walks through my door in my private work, generally because in my psychiatric hospital work I have no choice in the matter. So I am the one in my private community who ends up with the highest intensity cases. I have to be very careful with how I structure my work-life balance. I can't say I'm particularly succeeding at the moment but I'm working on it.

I end up working on developing specializations nobody else in my area offers who is competent with in order to meet the needs of the community. I still get plenty of patients who I am not completely good fits for. We have entire conversations about how to learn more about and tackle their concerns together, rather than me coming from an expert point of view. Many clients are happy just for me being willing to SEE them when nobody else in the area will do so. It's both inspiring and heart-breaking at the same time.

I decided at some point in the madness of it all that I can only take a certain number of clients at a time privately. I know that isn't a particular luxury in other community mental health settings: at a hospital I can see as little as 1 person a day and as many as 10. So I aggressively structure my hours in my private work to accommodate for the potential intensity of hospital. This may mean keeping my caseload very low at times, knowing that's all that I am able to give at that point.

I also rely heavily on my professional community of supports. I seek supervision on a TON of different stuff that I feel I don't have a complete grasp in and that has helped me immensely. Not even just complete supervision sessions: being able to text/call colleagues with random questions or suggestions is so helpful to me. 

I also make sure to schedule my time during my private days to accommodate an extended break. When the gyms are open I do that usually along with lunch. It makes a world of difference and I'm glad I can do it.

We see more an more people jumping straight into private work now-a-days (at least where I am) and avoiding this type of setting all together but I feel those folks miss out on vital growth experiences as well as sharing the professional burden of shouldering the more intense presentations like we all should be doing. So major kudos to you for being willing to work in this type of setting."
psychotherapy,fqrf5g2,t3_gk8xoe,1589583131.0,"It depends on whether you are using in-network benefits (as in you are paneled with a company) or a client is asking to submit to out-of-network benefits (you are NOT paneled or may be a certified out-of-network provider).

Let's use your example of the therapist charging $100 a session.

For in-network benefits:

1. Does the insurance kick in? If yes, then you submit a claim charging $100 dollars. The EOB will tell you exactly what the terms of the client's insurance are: for example, let's say the client's insurance has a $5 co-pay when it kicks in. So, they pay you the $5 co-pay, you submit the claim, and then you will (eventually) be reimbursed the amount in your contract for the services rendered. Let's say that you get reimbursed $70. So total, that is $75. That is all you will get from that session for that client.
2. Does the client have insurance (with mental health benefits) but insurance does NOT kick in? Usually the client needs to meet their deductible in this instance before insurance kicks in. If so, then the client will be on the hook for the full $100. You will collect the full $100, submit the claim, and then the insurance company will subtract $100 from the client's deductible. This will continue until the client has met their deductible for the calendar year (then you will go to step 1).
3. Does the client have insurance (WITHOUT mental health benefits)? Then you will charge the client $100 dollars and not submit a claim to insurance (because they will get nothing out of that). The client could then file that amount for self-pay healthcare on their taxes to see if they can deduct some of their expenses (if they meet certain criteria).

For out-of-network benefits:

1. Does the client's insurance plan kick in? If yes, then you will charge the client $100 and generate a superbill to the client. The client will then submit that to their insurance company themselves and see if they get anything reimbursed to THEM.

When taking insurance, you charge everyone in these situations the same amount: $100. Depending on the circumstances, you may or may not end up actually collecting $100."
psychotherapy,fqpk4v7,t1_fqpjude,1589548294.0,"Oh completely! And you can see how sometimes child-oriented techniques can even have some impacts on adults who fit that description you stated in your passion: healing from childhood wounds. 

I use play therapy techniques all the time with adults in my office and find it to be incredibly effective. I also utilize things like sand tray too. It can be super fun and really be eye-opening as a clinician. So even if you decide not to work with children during your professional career you can still take some of those tools with you."
psychotherapy,fqpj9s6,t3_gk8jwy,1589547734.0,"A lot of people refuse to work with children because of some of the reasons you listed in your post. It is definitely a special population that requires its own training and understandings compared to working with adults. 

One thing I think people VASTLY underestimate with kiddos though is the presence of a caring, thoughtful adult figure in the child's life, which you on some level fill that role when you work with them professionally. Especially with teenagers- I keep some on my caseload that I check in with occasionally just as a means of continued support after our therapeutic process is done and it is all they need to function normally. 

If you ever get a chance to shadow a child therapist, I would wholly recommend it. You can slowly address some of those concerns you have in vivo as well as in supervision. There are not enough of us out there who are willing to see kiddos and there are many who could benefit from our help."
psychotherapy,fqo4m6n,t1_fqnmyab,1589507457.0,I agree with this. If there is something about their case besides their presenting concerns that is rubbing you the wrong way or some extenuating circumstance I would just say that you don't think you would work well together and offer referrals to other providers.
psychotherapy,fqk7406,t3_gizu3n,1589421424.0,"I am in the process of getting credentialed privately and already work with insurance companies through a community setting, so I work with that push-pull quite often.

Where I am (similar area to you it looks like), insurances have not been completely terrible about dictating care. Like others have said, United/Optum will have you pry their contract rates from their cold hands quite often. You will likely spend a lot of time on the phone with them (they are by far the most annoying to get auths for). BCBS FL is OKAY if you know what you are doing; sometimes they ask for follow-up paperwork but it's not terrible. Cigna and Aetna I've never had issues with personally- Cigna's EAP paperwork sucks though (and like /r/muscravageur says for whatever reason they sometimes give auth for 8-12 sessions which makes NO sense since most EAPs do up to 4.) Medicaid plans are capped by 24 outpatient sessions a year no matter the provider, so if you cannot resolve a client's presenting concerns in that amount of sessions you will have to work something else out. 95% of the time those clients just stop coming. I find Medicaid to be the biggest pain due to all of the admin work to upkeep it.

I'm being picky about the plans I take privately because I already know what BS each company makes you go through. That way I can balance it a bit better since it's mostly just me doing all the admin work."
psychotherapy,fqj6aem,t1_fqigxrc,1589405625.0,"Sure. So I utilize the BPSA as my ""main"" assessment- I have one specifically for minors and one for adults (17 and under uses minor one, 18+ is adults). There are some slight changes in questions but mostly the same. For some specific issues, I have add-on assessments that go more in-depth with certain sections of my BPSA- I have an in-depth substance use assessment for my teens, for example. I also have an in-depth sexual history that I use with clients who are having sex-related difficulties (can be used with both minors and adults with slight changes). My other big one is my in-depth risk assessment; it takes elements from CAMS and the CSSRS-full and also has a safety plan built into it (again, minors and adults). 

For some of my take-home assessments, it's usually behavioral assessments, ADHD assessments, and emotional intelligence stuff. Lots of the assessments have sheets for different adults to fill out based on their observations and experiences (So like, the Child Behavior Inventory has a parent form, a client form, and a teacher form). I have the family bring them back during the next session.

I go over the form with them and do some light interpreting during the session with the family and then I'll take time during my charting to go more in-depth with the results and maybe write down an interpretive report on it if it is needed for something."
psychotherapy,fqiec2l,t3_gj2uvv,1589394857.0,"Sure. I'm in the US, for reference. This is from the perspective of private practice.

My process slightly varies depending on age range, but it will look something like this:

1. My intakes are 90 minutes long (personal preference) and consist of two major stages: informed consent discussion and then completion of my initial assessment (I do a BPSA as my primary form and will sometimes utilize other assessments for specific cases).
2. I send all relevant forms to the family or client at time of scheduling. If it is a phone schedule, I grab their e-mail and send them the forms. For online schedules, they are given a link to access my forms through my website. I ask that they bring the forms filled out and signed with them to the session: I try not to have them send them back to me electronically (although I have done it via fax before).
3. The first meeting can involve anyone who wants to be there as long as the client is okay with it. For younger kids (7-11) it will be at least 1 parent (my state is a 1 parent consent state) and then anyone else (preferably not siblings but depending on the circumstances maybe). Usually it's parents/grandparents/guardians. They will generally remain in the room for the entirety of the session. For my kids age 12-15 I generally ask them what they would prefer- to have family in the room or to have them wait outside. For kids age 16 and up, I ask that they see me alone for the assessment portion. Consenting parents/guardians will remain for the informed consent portion regardless.
4. At the end of the first meeting, if I decide to assess through interview forms for parents or other adults in the child's life (like teachers or what not) I'll send them home with the family.

We then go over how the first session went during the second session and begin diving into more specific parts from the BPSA and start goal setting."
psychotherapy,fqichgw,t3_ghrpon,1589394169.0,"I use a sliding scale for the time being for most of my caseload (I'm still in the process of paneling with insurance). However, I set up my sliding scale so as not to put it so low that it would make it difficult for me to survive financially. It goes down to about \~70% of my regular rate and that's about as far as I go. I also make sure that lowest amount is something that I'm comfortable with and something more people can reasonably afford. In addition, I have about 2-3 slots for pro-bono/severely reduced fee (like Open Path clients). 

Once I start taking insurances (just got on my first panel today- 4 more to go!) then I will probably change my sliding scale policy to account for the likely amounts that insurance will reimburse. 

When I established my sliding scale, I looked at a few things: what other therapists in the area charge, the general cost of living for the area, the types of jobs that are more common in the area and their salaries, etc. I also adjust it depending on events going on in the world- like with the COVID pandemic, I've been going down to about \~60% my rate and opened up another 1-2 slots for pro bono for frontline professionals."
psychotherapy,fqhjbfd,t1_fqh686w,1589378140.0,I feel this. For the first time I'm starting to feel like I'm doing too much. Working between a psych hospital and doing pretty much full time private work alongside has been eating away more at me lately and I've decided to start stepping back from the hospital because of it.
psychotherapy,fqbvbwo,t1_fqbrcz0,1589244632.0,"No, because IMO therapists post stuff on this subreddit specifically for other therapists' input. It is very rare that therapists post threads asking for client input or even that clients perspectives are posted by people. That is not the main intention of this subreddit is what I am saying. There are other subreddits for that purpose.

I never said that all clients don't understand jargon and therapeutic literature but I would not expect a hefty portion of the client-perspective lurkers to completely get everything a particular therapist might outline in a post. Hence why I feel like it might not necessarily add elements to a discussion that a therapist might be asking for. 

Also, I'm not sure why you state that my statement before is condescending but then right after it make a condescending statement. I get that therapists can make posts and comments that show a lack of understanding or ignorance with a particular subject/idea/whatever, but we want to encourage that therapist base to post and get other resources to develop more understanding and take new perspectives. Again, most of the reason why I think this subreddit exists; so therapists can discuss these types of things and help each other out."
psychotherapy,fqbqw99,t1_fqbp4rr,1589242180.0,"Well, from my perspective, the whole point of r/psychotherapy was with mental health professionals talking to other mental health professionals about things more unique to our own practice and work. There's a lot of theory, jargon, and interpretation that can be laid forth in the threads that lay-persons or clients do not necessarily know about. I think it's fine for them to lurk but I don't necessarily think they need to be posting on the threads. Our aim isn't usually to get a client perspective but rather solicit other therapists for their ideas.

There are other subreddits where both clients and therapists interact and are likely more appropriate for that. I like having this subreddit be more of a haven for practicing mental health professionals where we can talk with one another and on some level understand the struggles we go through. While a lot of us definitely have our own professional groups IRL not everyone does, and this can be a safe space for them to talk about what's going on for them professionally."

In my area the general going rate is about \~200-250 per panel. I paid \~1200 for 5 panels.

Also keep in mind getting on panels is not guaranteed, so you gotta be willing to also do research into what companies will likely panel with you."
psychotherapy,fqa3gwz,t1_fq2p4tk,1589212145.0,"I still do this right now but am slowly looking into changing into an S-Corp and hiring people so payroll will be required for me.

Having payroll means you can apply for different types of business structures, which can help reduce tax burden come tax time. It also allows you to more easily hire people since that system will already be set up for you. You can also clearly show when and how much you are paying yourself, even if you are alone.

Also, they help correct errors and troubleshoot with you when there are discrepancies in income.

One big example for right now is related to the PPP funds from the CARES Act. Having payroll means you can cleanly show where those funds are going, as opposed to not, where you have to use more thorough tracking and information to justify it come forgiveness application time."
psychotherapy,fqa2x4b,t1_fq2s81r,1589211860.0,"Yes. I'm doing it right now. My particular credentialing company I got for me privately specializes in doing hospital credentialing and was the one the hospital I was also working at used to credential me with all the insurance companies for them. So it was easy for the company to start the process privately for me. I'm going on 2 months with them and I should be signing my first contract and getting paneled with my first company this week. Have 4 more in the pipeline but with COVID going on we will see how long they take.

They can be expensive but IMO so far it's been worth. Try and find a company that other people you know have used and ones that offer full insurance credentialing management: my company also handles audits, CAQH changes, documentation requests, etc."
psychotherapy,fpvg3ai,t3_gfs2eh,1588943996.0,"There are definitely projections of emotions involved like the others have said but transference also can be underlying belief systems and cognitive processes too. Transference happens all of the time and can take the form of emotional expressions or expectations and ideas projected onto another. 

So, for example, let's say a client experiences transference with you as a parental figure. You may remind them of something endearing from their parents (there are all kinds of 'parental figure' transference scenarios). So, they subconsciously seek out your affections, strive to remain complicit and motivated in therapy to subtly seek your praise, and may describe you in some of the same ways they may describe their parent.

Obviously, transference can range from having minor to major impacts in the therapy process, depending on what it is. IMO it's always something to keep mind of and to practice bringing up in session. Your theoretical orientation will have varying degrees of active work with transference."
psychotherapy,fpshppd,t3_gfao6t,1588873664.0,"I never was able to fully stop seeing clients in office.

Some of my clients struggle with chronic severe mental illness so for their sake I've kept them in office with the safest cleaning and social distancing regiment as I can. Thankfully the rest of my clients switched to tele-health no problem but for some of my clients it's either I see them in office or they gradually decompensate and require inpatient care. I pushed for as many as I thought could potentially handle it to go tele-health but many of them did not last long before I began feeling too uncomfortable with it.

I also spend some of my time working at the local psychiatric hospital so I get a double whammy of direct interaction with clients.

I'm hoping that I can start gradually bringing back clients once I move into my bigger office in a couple of months and there's more of an idea on how the virus is going and what progress there is on treatment."

I will say that I've only ever seen MBTI properly used one time ever (by an old professor who basically helped revise the whole thing) and it was absolutely amazing what she could pull from the results. But everyone else who I've seen use it has not been nearly as successful. I totally get why it does not pan out well psychometrically.

When someone is in acute distress or needs some form of grounding, consented, appropriate touch can be extremely therapeutic during those times. You can absolutely maintain professional boundaries while still being human and offering occasional physical interaction outside of a handshake. This can include fist bumps, small hugs, etc. Rubbing a back is about as far as I go and only in more extreme circumstances and with high rapport. Not sure I've ever done it outside of the psych hospital while during acute crisis now that I think about it. 

Hugs and fist bumps I do quite often with my kiddos."
psychotherapy,fpb4nh9,t3_gc859e,1588462024.0,"While doing my hospital gig, had a client we had recently released from inpatient come back with his parents for a follow-up med management app (young adult at this point). I had built a lot of rapport with client the last time he admitted (manic episode with psychosis). Clearly still somewhat psychotic after discharge and follow-up, parents brought him to the inpatient center from outpatient because of his behavior and refusal to get and take his meds.

Had to sit down with him for a long time and re-build rapport to get him to trust me enough to convince him he needed help. Was crying, wanted hugs and someone to just hold him while he tried to figure things out. Parents were mortified at the things he was saying.

Never before that had I ever given such a parental/tenderly approach to an actively psychotic adult. Part of me always had a sort of fear for the younger adults who were actively psychotic because of some crazy shit I've seen before that def. has trauma vibes to it. Did the whole risk assessment while I was rubbing his back and he cried. Ended up admitting voluntarily rather than me doing it involuntarily.

He came over with me as I got him sat down and situated after I admitted him. Sat with him until he fell asleep and checked on him every few hours. After a few days off I came back to work and saw him. Had pretty much recovered from the episode and was so grateful for the time I took."
psychotherapy,fp05d8g,t3_gaj6wt,1588202791.0,"What was the justification for the DID therapist to suggest you continue working with the client with them supervising you? At that point, they would be providing the service to you so they would be billing you, not the client. I've never heard of a supervisor billing the patient for that; it seems like it changes the dynamic of the therapeutic relationship in addition to possibly being a financial strain on the client having to pay two different providers for the same overarching treatment. IMO, the supervisor should never have access to any financial or identifying information from the client.

It's not unheard of to bring another expert on for supervision but generally you choose to undertake that yourself (at your own cost) and not pass the burden onto the client. Now if the client were to agree to such a request I could see you potentially charging a higher hourly fee due to the service itself becoming more specialized to the point that you are seeking out supervision (and paying for it yourself) to do it. But it wouldn't be an entire other fee. 

So, for example: say your regular fee is $100 an hour. You work out an agreement with the supervisor to be charged $50 per supervision hour, occurring biweekly (so $100 a month). You can either decide to eat that $100 yourself (so you make $300 a month off that client instead of $400) or you can charge your client slightly higher (say, $15 more per session, for an additional $60 a month, so you only eat $40) to offset the cost a bit. This would obviously depend on the client's financial situation if it were feasible. I would HOPE that the supervisor would give you a break on their fee to oversee your work with the client.

I put into my fee schedule and informed consent that specialized services can potentially cost more and would be quoted upon consultation. This would be one of those occasions to use that clause and see what I felt would work best to value my time, the supervisor's time, and not strain the client financially while still providing the best quality treatment."
psychotherapy,fozh7vy,t3_gadiu0,1588190611.0,"I would gauge your current rapport with the client and if you had gotten a release of information for the parents from the beginning. How you respond is going to depend highly on your personal style of communication and how you feel you can use the communication therapeutically with your client. I always recommend getting an ROI for all of my clients (even adults), especially if a family member is paying for therapy, if possible.

If there's no release and you have zero contact or rapport with the parents/client, I would not say anything at all and bring it up with client in their next session. Any kind of acknowledgment from you might confirm that you are seeing the son, which in and of itself can be a breach of confidentiality. Plus, you have to gauge how the client feels about parental involvement in his therapy: would the client feel that this is an invasion of privacy in some way?

If you have a release for parents or client's parents clearly know that you are seeing him as a client (say he's brought them into session before or something), I would at least acknowledge the e-mail and say thanks for letting you know. Depending on your rapport with parents you may be able to tailor it a bit more to you.

I remember going through something like this during school; I lost both a former classmate and a close friend to suicide within the same year. 

I couldn't handle doing any kind of work at the time. I sat in one of my professor's offices and just bawled my eyes out. Just like your clients do, you go through a process. Whatever that process looks like to you. You've got to give yourself that time.

Since you are a new therapist, do you have a professional circle? Now is the time to be leaning on them HARD. In addition to your own personal support system, of course. I found that the people who helped me the most were my other therapist colleagues and co-workers; they understood the difficulties I had specifically with seeing clients and how my own grief process changed the way I engaged in the therapy process. Having supervisor(s) to fall back on was the absolute best. Being just a phone call or text away helped me more than I could ever thank them for.

The other thing that super helped me was going to my own therapy. I was able to engage in my own grief process and just BE the client, removing my professional side for a bit and just being a person. That was so reinvigorating for me. The hardest part I had was putting my own needs (stopping and getting my own therapy, not answering the phone every time, taking things slow and not going into anything too deep in session at times) above my clients; I felt so guilty for that. My therapist helped me understand that balancing those things is what helped propel me forward in my quality of care for my clients.

I also sublimated a bit (haha!) and started researching and reading death works. It helped me start learning about thanatology and now it's one of my pet projects I work on in my spare time. I found that helped me turn my own grief process into a source of strength and empowerment.

I also have it auto-set to send over different assessment measures each week before appointments. It's been super helpful for my clients who keep up with it (I have about an 80% adherence rate so long as I bring it up in session and encourage it).

TBH, if you can find an area outside of Orlando that you like then that's probably a safe bet. That way you can travel into the city to do things but cost of living is a bit cheaper.

HHS is stating that they will not be enforcing penalties on providers who initiate tele-health services on non-HIPAA compliant platforms until further notice. Note that this does not mean you can just willy-nilly communicate however you want: clinical judgment is still needed and it is likely wise to attempt to use as many HIPAA compliant methods first as possible.

I don't know what everyone else's experience has been like, but I've had some issues using my preferred platform, likely due to the increase in network traffic.

The ones that are specifically not allowed include any that require you to be public facing: the examples used are TikTok, Twitch, and Facebook Live, among others.

Also, highly recommended that if anyone is using a non-HIPAA compliant platform for tele-health to amend their informed consent and notify clients of potential privacy breaches due to not using a HIPAA compliant format."

It's better to have SOME interaction than none at all. And if your therapist or you get infected then there's a chance the symptoms will prevent you from being able to continue until you are better.

Do your best with the noise. If your walls are indeed paper thin, then cranking up the volume on your phone and sticking it somewhere may suffice. Or, if you can do the tele-psych on your phone, putting your laptop somewhere in the room with music on.

If you made concrete plans about what would be done in those sessions it might not be so bad; you would be focused on a goal. But when someone comes in more frequently because of emotional overload then that's what the session becomes about; you spend the entire time stuck in your emotional state and that gets very tiring over time.

Perhaps coming to a more compromising set-up: like 1 in person session and 1 tele-session, or 2 in person sessions and then a phone check in, might help with that. Usually when I have emotionally heavy sessions with clients I'll ask if I can check in with them in a few days over the phone, and then from there we can plan for another session if we need to.

1. Having licensed staff sit with interns who then provide services via tele-health. Obviously not an optimal set up and not all places would allow that liability wise, but it might be better than the clients not going with services at all.
2. Referring out the students to nearby providers who are either able to provide tele-health services or see them in-house. And would be willing to do it pro-bono or low fee.

Transference (in the psychodynamic realm) is the projection of thoughts, feelings, behaviors, or beliefs onto other people (what we often actually define as transference), places, or things. Object relations theory heavily leans into and expands on the ideas of transference.

What a lot of people fail to recognize is that transference is a natural human process. It is something that begins from when we are very small all throughout life. It can have both positive (like falling in love your with therapist) or negative (like someone reminding of you a past abuser) connotations. Psychodynamic theory suggests that these relationships we create between ""objects"" in the world occur subconsciously and shape our view of the world. Hence why the particular theoretical model seeks to highlight the complexities of these relationships and teach skills to point them out and modify them as needed.

In a therapeutic setting, a skilled therapist will understand the innate value of transference reactions and seek to help the client understand them a bit better, too. Often times, we can use these ideas to help the client overcome relational obstacles and past hurtful beliefs and ideas. The therapist inserts and uses themselves as a structure, allowing the client to project onto them, and then bring those things up and discuss them.

When a therapist then has a reaction to the transference, we call that countertransference. Ideally, a therapist will want to be as much of a ""blank slate"" as possible for the client's own transference to present without any manipulation or ""tainting"" so to speak. Of course, realistically speaking, this is impossible: the therapist, like the client, also has their own transference reactions, and thus countertransference is always present. A therapist who cannot manage their own countertransference subtly influences the client in ways which cause them to lose the original site of their transference. That's a bit part of why older-style therapists often times have done their own work themselves."

PTSD diagnosis is very specific, and I agree with a lot of other folks here that a lot of times liberal use of PTSD will occur when Criterion A is not met. I've heard the argument of ""the client determines how threatening it is"" and leave it at that, DESPITE the fact that the DSM lists out a series of concrete examples that justify Criterion A. For a lot of them, it meant that ""as long as their feelings were damaged ""enough"" they met the criteria.""

AskReddit,fjz30a1,t3_fffdkb,1583710206.0,"Hello! I'm a licensed mental health counselor operating out of a call center 2 days a week from the psych hospital I work at taking shifts for the Suicide Lifeline. I do this while also operating our hospital's admissions department.

I usually end up taking the really serious ones over from either volunteers or our lower level counselors. So I have gotten people who have called mid-suicide attempt or just after they attempted. I've had some chilling experiences before but even amongst the worst ones I get I'm happy to say that (as far as I know) I've gotten help to most all of the folks who called and I had the pleasure of talking with. Talking people away from their method or to find someone nearby for help is really stressful and difficult sometimes. Thankfully I've never had anyone die who I've been on the phone with.

We field pretty much every single call that comes out of our area of the state. I am able to also converse with crisis mobile units that can sometimes go out to actually see the person instead of us calling law enforcement. That has gone better and I can keep in the loop with what's going on (less police violence and involuntary psychiatric admits that way).

I have extra training in suicidology and thanatology as well as am quite interested in the forensic work that goes into death by suicide. It helps immensely with these types of calls: lots of times folks just want someone who listens and is able to understand just a little bit. I get a little bit of everything: people with serious medical diagnoses, chronic pain, severe substance use, veterans with severe PTSD, and lots of loved ones who call out of concern for family/friends.

I always hold on to the sliver of hope that someone calls because they want help and not because they truly want to die."

A few things to note about how HIPAA requires your records to be handled:

1. You have a right to request your records at any time. Any records request should be submitted in writing preferably. The requested provider has up to 60 days to give you an answer regarding the request (comply or deny) but can take up to an additional 60 days depending on certain circumstances.
2. Your medical record is about you, but keep in mind, it is *owned* by the creating agency. That gives them certain ability to withhold aspects of your record per HIPAA guidelines. 
3. If a provider denies your records request, they must provide a justifiable reason behind it. Otherwise, you can take the denial to an attorney who can then go through legal avenues to obtain.
4. When requesting a record, there are some things that are generally readily ""requestable"" so to speak; such as initial assessment, any diagnoses, treatment plans, surveys/assessments completed, prescriptions written, submitted insurance claims and invoicing information, and so forth. Some state laws have amends to HIPAA that allow for more. In general, though, note that progress notes are protected federally from being accessed without judicial intervention (these are your session-to-session notes that your provider keeps on what you talk about and do).
5. In terms of who can see the record, HIPPA states that only approved providers are able to view all or part of record. That includes you, your servicing agency (this may include other people who work there in addition to your specific psychologist), any billing department they use (to process stuff), insurance companies (if using insurance), and anyone who you give express written permission to access the records; these are usually other providers (I get a lot of GP notes and med management notes from some of my clients' other providers and coordinate care with them, for example.)
6. The only people who can view your un-altered record without your consent (or waived consent) are your healthcare proxy (if you have one), if you have a psychiatric advanced directive and are deemed incompetent/incapacitated, or if you are being sanctioned by a judge who is asking for your records. Also note that, depending on your state's laws, sometimes emergency situations can warrant the breaking of HIPAA in order to potentially save your life.
7. In terms of holding records, HIPAA requires a minimum of 7 years post termination for the records to be stored securely. Most agencies follow that (because storing records can be a pain in the butt if you have a lot of clients).

A healthcare provider will generally do nothing with your medical record unless they are compelled do by laws or a judge. In the beginning of your time with your psychologist, they should have went over those possibilities with you. HIPAA is pretty airtight and penalties for breaking it are quite steep."
psychotherapy,fjoneq1,t3_fehao6,1583531260.0,"Okay, as someone in PP, here's what I'd do in that situation:

1. Greet them as they come in. Note: rapport building starts NOW and continues throughout the rest of the steps.
2. Give them the Core-OM (It's the standard name for the Core-34) while they are in the waiting room with their intake paperwork. If this isn't possible, bring them in and hand it to them right away to fill out while you get set up to start the interview.
3. Take a peek at the answers, highlighting a couple of areas to focus on in your interview. No need to score it right away; you can do that after.
4. Start intake interview with your introduction and then ask them what brings them in.
5. Start perusing the Core answers that stick out to you and weaving those questions into the interview. This can also help with bringing in other things that might be listed as information to gather on your assessments.
6. SOME places require you to treatment plan immediately. Figure out your agency's policies. I generally do not treatment plan immediately, but I might say something like ""so it sounds like what you want to work on is X/Y/Z, is that right?"" or ""I wonder if it would be helpful to you if we addressed X/Y/Z in our time together?"" That way if you don't have to treatment plan immediately then it gives you an idea of where the client wants to go.
7. Since CBT generally aims to move towards resolution of symptoms within 12-16 sessions, you will want to treatment plan no later than session 2 or 3 if you don't have to right away.

Since you are going the CBT route, you want to be thinking about (based on the interview and Core measure) what types of ideas might be helpful to the client and how they can bring those ideas into their daily routine with practical applications.

Good luck! You got this. :)"
psychotherapy,fjnbmu7,t3_fecwrq,1583503544.0,"My state only allows pre-licensed clinicians to bill certain Medicaid plans under the a licensed Medicaid provider who is directly supervising the pre-licensed clinician.

When I was pre-licensed (we call that ""Registered Internship"" here) we generally had no option to bill insurance. However, depending on how savvy you were with navigating insurance and talking with providers, sometimes you were able to get a superbill to them that they would use for out-of-network benefits. I've done it a few times successfully; one was able to get a portion of their bill reimbursed, the other few generally had the amounts they paid applied to their deductible. I've also gotten authorization for 1 Single Case Agreement (SCA) during the time I was pre-licensed (it was awful).

When I utilized superbills, the insurance took MY information (so my tax ID, NPI, credentials, etc.) and then made a determination of whether or not they would allow it. Same thing with SCA's.

In my state, if a pre-licensed clinician was billing through Medicaid under a licensed Medicaid provider, they would be added to the Medicaid providers provider list and have to be brought on as an employee to their company (usually 1099). At that point, the licensed Medicaid provider's information would be used.

Granted, I also worked for a psychiatric hospital while pre-licensed (and into licensure) so that has helped my ability to work with insurance companies since that's part of my job there.

So this comes from experience in my state and relates to how my state's education system interacts with acute mental health services. This can be both K-12 as well as secondary (K-12 is generally more of a nightmare though since minors). Here are some things we consistently struggle with:

1. The schools make police officers initiate involuntary orders, at times without ANY input from the mental health professional. The way school infrastructure is setup, lots of districts have rules against school counselors (regardless of your actual licensure) initiating involuntary examinations. So they call the school safety officer and basically tell them to do it. The officer who does not have nearly as much training as the counselor. When we receive the involuntary examination order, it is not nearly as detailed and specific as we would like. Jargon specific language and assessment used are very nice (""C-SSRS deemed person high risk, PHQ-9 scored this morning was a 23, presents with current SI with plan to overdose on accessible pills and recent attempt within the last 2 weeks. Also recently self-isolating from support system and has been drinking alcohol alone."" Something like this is GREAT. Not ""Student reports wanting to die."")
2. Liability gets passed around for risk assessment and execution of involuntary examination orders. I get a call from a school: ""hey, we are sending you this person, insert name and DOB."" ""Great, who initiated the involuntary order?"" ""I don't know, the school counselor or police officer or school psychologist"" ""Okay, can I speak with them?"" ""No you can't. The officer bringing the child will tell you anything you need to know."" Fast-forward to when we receive kid: ""so what's going on?"" ""Oh I don't know much. School just told me to bring them. Seems pretty sad though."" Yay.
3. For minors, parents are almost never called prior to executing an examination order. So the parent either finds out by the kid not coming home from school or us calling them. Then we get the angry parent who threatens us and refuses to understand what has happened and we have to explain it to them. Also, it's about a 50/50 chance we will get a student's demographic forms from the school. So if we have never had this student before, we have to hope they either know their parents phone number or we can contact the school. Same for figuring out custody if there's any issues.
4. For college-aged kids, there's very little education on what actually happens after an involuntary examination. They are often told ""oh you will go there for a few hours and probably release"" by police/staff, who lie just to get them to cooperate. Then once they get there and release it could be days before release, they lose it. We have to deal with that fallout too.
5. We TRY and cooperate with school mental health professionals, but some of them are just plain unreachable. Our state's involuntary examination forms have a place for a phone number and you are SUPPOSED to be available shortly after initiating one, but lots of places will put the school's main line and then we have to either hope we can get ahold of them or give up. We want to know what has been done prior to initiating the involuntary examination (if anything at all) and depending on the time we get the person we might be outta luck.
6. Autism involuntary examinations everywhereeeeeee. A CSU is not going to help with ASD. Our laws specifically prohibit using involuntary examination orders in this way. The courts get super pissed when we have to present a case like this in front of them. But it still happens anyway (both primary and secondary).

Unfortunately, some hospitals also just plain suck. I'm lucky in that in my current places I have pretty free reign to work as I see fit so I can interact a lot more with someone's family and school. I am usually able to convince college-aged adults to sign relevant ROIs and coordinate care. But that does not always happen. And we are under CONSTANT pressure from surrounding hospitals and the courts to discharge. I could do without talking about the ""least-unwell client"" and comparing them to each other. Our facility is the only in-county receiving facility, we have 32 beds, and our county has over 40k residents. So yea, quite a need there too."

I use CAMS work heavily myself when working with acute suicidal ideation and also pull heavily from Thomas Joiner's work on the topic (and also Roy Baumeister). The C-SSRS is a great assessment tool for working with high schoolers.

Getting really good safety planning and communication with family in place is essential. The former is easier to implement than the ladder. I find that being able to have a frank discussion with the kiddos about it lowers their immediate risk: many of them don't want to see it as an option but life circumstances or difficulty with processing situations make it seem more appealing to them. Same thing with self-injury (suicidal and non) which you will also see quite a bit of. Helping them to redirect their own thinking towards small, practical ways to increase safety are key. Getting whatever support system you can involved as early as possible is also a major key.

Also, keep in mind your county/state's policy on involuntary examinations. That's been more of an issue lately where I am and it's become more of a nightmare to deal with on the hospital's end."

If your drinking was predominantly a coping mechanism to avoid feeling the sadness and dealing with the depressive episodes, then it makes sense that you would find yourself drinking less as you decide to face your depressive episodes head on and express them.

Because of those circulating inner assumptions, though, you find that strategy to not be super helpful and that over time you probably find yourself more anxious. It's an internal feedback loop.

I would encourage you to open up about your feelings related to that anxiety with your therapist. Being honest about how you feel regarding your past relationships (""I haven't really had any"") and that it feels like new territory with your therapist in terms of closeness, and how that makes you anxious. If your therapist is good with relational work, they should be able to take it from there. :)"
TalkTherapy,fikwaiy,t1_fikn2aa,1582488461.0,"Here's a couple of examples:

1) Let's say a client has a tendency to become very anxiously attached (recurring belief that they will be abandoned, continuously seeks reassurance or comfort from relationship figure, has difficulty with regulating emotion with any potential unknowns in their relationship) and has inevitably played that out in the therapist-client relationship. I might spearhead the conversation by speaking to the anxiety and pressure I might feel in our relationship when I attempt to continuously comfort or assure the client. I might ask the client what others in their life who fill similar roles that I fill in that moment might say about how they feel about it themselves. After a lot of processing, I might challenge the client to identify how their underlying difficulty with the relationship (there are a lot of potential reasons) sabotages their ability to build and keep those relationships stable, and then ask what can be done in moments of interaction to combat that. Those changes are what the client then might do in the moments of interaction to combat what they are used to.

2) Let's say a client has a tendency to pull away from increasing levels of intimacy and places internal pressure on themselves (we might call this avoidant attachment), which then pushes them away from their support systems and leaves their relational partners feeling lost and confused. Again, this often times plays out in the therapist-client relationship. I might discuss with a client how difficult it may be for me to communicate with them about their feelings and inner thoughts, and how I might sometimes feel that they rebuff or retreat from my interactions with them. I, again, might ask how others who might feel similarly respond to the client's interactions with them and how that helps or hurts their relationships with those people. Our goal would be to identify underlying ideas that signal to the client to retreat away and not allow any sort of vulnerability or weakness to present itself to others, and then ask how the client can push through those intense moments in order to increase intimacy and open up with their relationship. Those attempts to push through are the adjustments within our relationship.

It looks VASTLY different depending on the person and their past relational experience."
TalkTherapy,fikfks7,t3_f8a8rk,1582479413.0,"Therapist here:

Absolutely I notice the attachment struggles. I actively work with attachment theory so for me I often refer back to the relationship I have with the client and how it relates/differs from other relationships the client has had. Usually I'm a bit more hands on at first with pointing out the attachment Dynamics but over time I give it to the client to identify and manage. I use the therapeutic relationship to Foster a secure attachment but also let the client explain how the changes over time. 

When a client tells me they are afraid of me abandoning them or that they are becoming too attached or something I feel honored that they would open up about that with me and then ask them how their previous experiences led them to feeling that way with me. I allow the client (within reason) to adjust our relationship so that they can see what changes work/don't work in a controlled environment before trying it outside of therapy.

It's a very powerful experience for both of us."

TalkTherapy,figoyit,t3_f7wmy0,1582402181.0,"Therapist here. I work my own private practice and also work admissions at an inpatient hospital.

My situation is a bit different since I generally do not build therapeutic relationships with my clients at the hospital. I engage in assessment and make recommendations for them for their stay in inpatient (as well as after) but that's usually it. However, there are a few clients who are a bit more frequent to our inpatient services, and thus I see them more than just a couple of times. I've built up some rapport with them and sometimes will even go on unit to check on them and help de-escalate if they ever go into an acute crisis on unit and need assistance.

I'd say that, compared to working with those types of clients at the hospital, I am much more free to do what I wish with my clients at my private practice. I also don't have to think as hard about whether a particular intervention/gesture/support is against company policy or frowned upon compared to my private work.

For example, a simple hug. At an agency or facility, that is usually highly frowned upon. Sometimes, though, people just ask for a hug and would find it hugely beneficial, and so (assuming there aren't any other factors that might influence the benefit of the gesture) I might offer one to clients in my private work more often as opposed to my inpatient work. Ironically, since my private clients are generally higher functioning, they are less likely to require that kind of direct interaction with me as opposed to a client admitted inpatient. 

Financials, for me, play zero role in how I treat a particular client in session or think of them out of session, and I partner with an EAP as well as offer both reduced fees and pro-bono work privately. In my hospital setting, about 70-75% of clients cannot afford to pay for our services, although in that case we do not accept payments directly from clients (the hospital just pays us our salary).

So, while I wouldn't necessarily say I value my private practice clients over my hospital clients, I would say that in general it is easier to interact with and build rapport with my private clients, due to feeling freer to engage with clients in a way that would suit them better, as opposed to following strict rules/guidelines which may stifle genuine human interaction."

TalkTherapy,fibhkio,t3_f7f9ri,1582322098.0,"Therapist here;

So in this case, who is the identified client? Your initial post makes it SEEM as if your boyfriend is the identified client (and it sounds like in order to use the insurance the therapist matches the paperwork that way) and that you are being brought in to discuss your relationship as an aside to his individual work.

In true couples work, the relationship unit is considered the client, rather than each person separately, so the therapist works for the benefit of the relationship unit. Insurance can make that look funky on paper since most companies won't pay for couples work and so to use insurance the paperwork will show an individual as the identified client.

If you are being brought in as an aside with your boyfriend as the identified client (not just for paperwork sake), then there would not be a real ethical issue here. It still remains to be seen whether bringing you in for an occasional session is helpful; from your post my guess is that it is not.

If the relationship unit is considered the client (again, paperwork aside), then there is a higher chance for an ethical issue. It is not uncommon for a couple's therapist to see the individuals within the unit maybe once or twice, with couples sessions taking up the vast majority of the therapy time. If the dynamic is moving away from that (as in, the therapist is starting to see the boyfriend more individually rather than the couples) then that becomes more problematic.

If the therapist is keeping two separate filings on you (one for your boyfriend, one for the relationship unit) then that would be considered a dual relationship. That will be what you will have to show if you file a report with their governing body: that you are engaged in an active couples therapy relationship with this therapist and at the same time your boyfriend is engaged in an active individual therapy relationship with the same therapist, and that is causing harm to at least one party."

It sounds like you have seen an increase in suicidal thoughts and it's unsettling for you. You want to broach the subject with your therapist so you can work through it but are afraid that they will involuntarily admit you inpatient right before your vacation.

When someone wants to approach a difficult topic with me, I invite them at the beginning of session to direct the conversation as they like. Sometimes they will come into the office and go ""I want to talk about something difficult"" and then I'm all ears. The fact that you are wanting to talk about the difficulties you've been having with the suicidal thoughts will play into your counselor's risk assessment.

I encourage honesty whenever possible mixed with some realism. When considering speaking with your therapist, some of the questions they might ask include things like ""Have you started formulating a suicide plan? Do you have any lethal means available to you? Have you attempted before? Who in your support system knows about these thoughts?"" If you are willing and able to safety plan with your therapist then that increases your ability to remain at your current level of care."

psychotherapy,fhqrhc9,t1_fhqqxze,1581809717.0,"I work for myself but I incorporate both psychodynamic and CBT/DBT  elements. It is DEF doable it's all about how flexible you are between both approaches depending on what the client comes to you with. Generally starting with a CBT methodology as you treatment plan and begin symptom management works well in an agency setting, slowly incorporating psychodynamic work into the mix as the client begins challenging underlying beliefs. I find that psychodynamic work is much more effective for deeper philosophical work. Frankl is another great resource and I also pull from him on occasion.

Perhaps doing some of your own work and developing your own perspectives on some of those existential questions might be helpful? :)"
psychotherapy,fhqmce0,t3_f4gqcq,1581806664.0,"Sounds like there is some identity work there that is going unaddressed. When someone finds themselves to be a burden on everyone else, that tells me that there is a lack of self-efficacy, motivation, and self-sustenance. Part of their identity seems to be rooted in this idea that everyone around them lives a ""mediocre life"" and are at the mercy of the rules and responsibilities set onto us through living. I wonder what that viewpoint gets the client? If it didn't offer some level of benefit, whether it be conscious or not, then the client would not continue to invest in that viewpoint.

Nihilism in and of itself offers something to someone who believes heavily in it. I won't give away my perspective on that because it could be interpreted in different ways. I would heavily lean into that idea through psychodynamic work and allow the client to lead me on what they find useful out of it. If you wanted to take an existential spin on it, it might be worth considering the 4 pillars of existential concerns (Yalom). How might the client approach these now? Is there an alternative version the client might wish to align with?

Also, the client sports a belief that the professional people involved in his life are only there because they are paid to be there. While to an extent that is true, it might be worth exploring your own relationship with the client: does the client feel supported and encouraged by your thoughts and input into their thought process? How might you two better facilitate that bond so that the client may find more strength to push back against their nihilistic belief system if and when they decides to try something different?

It ALSO sounds like the client is subtly wondering if their entire identity is just their nihilistic views or if there is something more there. That is an invitation for further exploration. I wonder what else the client might find if, with a supportive environment, they begin to explore what aspects of identity they might align best with? Do those aspects support or defy that nihilistic viewpoint? I like using Archetypes for this kind of exploration myself.

My sense is that the client craves something with more substance and exploration rather than management of symptoms."
mentalhealth,fhq8z5a,t3_f4f2df,1581800855.0,"Oh this will be fun. I work at an inpatient facility and have worked at a few over the years.

Here's what my desire type of facility would look like (note, mental health side only, not substance abuse):

1. Separate involuntary versus voluntary admissions. Generally this will do some separation of diagnosis (those who are deemed incompetent obviously can't consent to treatment, so this would be like acute psychosis, manic episode, absolutely refuses consent to treatment for some reason, etc.). Lots of people who struggle with a high level of depression or anxiety will generally at some point consent to treatment voluntarily. Not sure if I would want forensic cases, but if I did, they would stay on the involuntary side.
2. Staff to patient ratios are BIG. My desired ratios: 3:1 patient/tech, 4:1 patient/nurse, 5:1 patient/psychiatrist, therapist, discharge planner. That way staff aren't getting overwhelmed with numbers and can focus on the quality of their service.
3. In terms of services, I would like to see 1 med management daily, 1 individual therapy daily, 4-5 group therapy daily, 1 discharge planning meeting daily, and at least 1-2 family meetings per stay.  Involuntary unit would likely have 1-2 less groups due to general lower level of functioning.
4. For unit layout, the voluntary unit would likely have a few more things that the involuntary unit. NO COMPUTERS. I've seen that and it's a nightmare. TVs are fine. Some video game systems are fine. A couple of wall unit phones on unit are fine. Voluntary unit would have access to an outside area with maybe a basketball court, some tables and chairs, and maybe a couple other outside games. Involuntary unit would get an outside sitting area. I'm a big proponent of outside time. I'd like to see a quiet area on the unit that's a little more sequestered away from the main day-room areas that clients can go when they start to feel overwhelmed by sensory input. We could avoid some seclusion orders with that. 2 seclusion/restraint rooms on involuntary unit, 1 seclusion/restraint room on voluntary unit. No more than 2 clients assigned to a bed room. Involuntary unit gets 2-3 single occupancy rooms, voluntary unit gets 1.
5. For admissions procedures, I'd give everyone who first comes in hospital scrubs to wear, and then once they've seen the psychiatrist they can get any appropriate street clothes they have. I'd rather have an airport full body type scanner than having to strip search somebody after they change, although we would lose the ability to see some important things on a client's body (self-harm, major scars/surgery stuff, weight, skin, etc.) They would then enter a secluded area to be assessed before coming onto the unit.
6. Discharge planning will include step-down levels of care when at all possible. I think a personal ""hand off"" of records would be super nice to outpatient providers. A client would be eligible for discharge when everyone (psychiatrist, nurse, therapist, and discharge planner) are in agreement that client is improved and would be safe. Staff would meet once per day together after seeing everyone to discuss their thoughts on discharges. 
7. One big thing I'd like to include is educational seminars for families of admitted clients so that they can feel more prepared to help with client concerns once they discharge to a lower level of care. Obviously this would be with client consent. Could offer a meeting once per day, maybe after a visitation session, that families could go to to ask questions or get information. Incorporating a client's support system into treatment and discharge decreases inpatient readmissions.

In my experience, the parent already has some idea of what's going on but might not know specifics. If I get to a point where I want to tell parents, I let the teen know and invite them to either tell them themselves or do it with me. If not then I just do it. Also, sometimes I meet with parents alone (with kid consent), and during those times if they ask about it I might give a generalized answer and ask them what prompted their asking, which usually then shows me how much they really know.
