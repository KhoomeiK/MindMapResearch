depression,f0v1egp,t3_d6dxpl,1568958881.0,"Look. There is no need to be perfect. Everyone has something wrong with them. The best thing for you is just to focus on yourself. Learn a new skill, find a hobby you enjoy, stop gazing into the abyss and find a way out of your prison. I go through the same thoughts all the time, and all it ever does is make you feel worse about your insecurities and dismiss any positive thoughts you may have for yourself. I found myself feeling a lot better when I felt accomplished in something. I was improving myself and I did it myself. No one could take that from me. We can't rely on other people to make us happy all the time; we have to find it on our own. If you're happy with yourself, that positivity radiates onto other people as well. People like and are attracted to things that can make them happy. Even if you never find a partner, there are still ways to enjoy life. I know that loneliness is a crushing feeling and fear everyone has. Regardless, the best way to live your life is to live it for yourself. Don't feel like you can't be happy because you're not in a relationship. They're not for everyone. Be happy because you are or will be the best version of you. You'll either find someone who likes you for who you are or not. You'll be okay in the end. I really hope you find someone, and I hope you're still trying to enjoy life if you don't."
GojiraMusic,ez8rafv,t3_cronoh,1567755181.0,"I was already into progressive/technical death metal. I was looking for more bands on the internet when I kept seeing this band come up in this list called Gojira. I heard they were good, but I kept putting them off because I was still on a Gorguts/Morbid Angel phase. After some time, I decided to listen to ""From Mars to Sirius"" and it blew my mind. I couldn't believe I was listening to something so brutally heavy and yet so emotional. I checked the rest of their discography and this album, The Way of All Flesh, and L'enfant Sauvage are some of my favorite metal albums of all time. I'm planning to go see them in San Diego in November. This will be my first ever metal show."
