As for your repose to my comment regarding three weeks of Doxy... 28 days minimum is the protocol for most patients now.

My story is I become ill at a young age, due to have 50+ ticks imbedded in me by the age of four. Was treated for one year with antibiotics and my case appeared to have been resolved. Unfortunately, 4 years ago I was either re-bit or Lyme and its co-infections came out of remission. Mostly neurological symptoms at first, but as of lately it’s progressed into physiological complications. Fortunately, I’m on four antibiotics at the moment, which have appeared to have helped some of my cardiovascular and eye issues. Most cases of Lyme however won’t become as serious or chronic, especially when treated right away.

marfans,flpg7hu,t1_floosue,1585358738.0,"Thank you! I do actually have NAC at home, and I’ll have to start taking it again. The WGS may be a good idea, because I’ve dealt with health issues throughout my life. Maybe that test can give me a better understanding of why that may be the case, and how I can better myself"
marfans,flpdm4b,t1_flowtq3,1585357020.0,"Never did I ask anyone to make a medical diagnosis or mention anything remotely related. Perhaps try changing your rules to something along the lines of “posts inquiring about MFS will be removed”. Do you know what a medical diagnosis is? A medical diagnosis is made by a medical professional, in a professional setting. All I did was ask a genuine question, as I was interested in MFS, because a medical professional mentioned it to me."
marfans,floqsn2,t1_flookz0,1585343594.0,"I asked for an opinion. Never any medical advice or diagnosis. This is a genuine concern of mine, considering I’ve had complications with my health for the last two months. I’m not self-diagnosing and this was suggested to me by a health professional."
marfans,flomkov,t1_floloz7,1585341212.0,"I’ve never have actually had genetic testing, except for MTHFR, which came back positive for heterozygous C667T. I do suffer from other illnesses, which may have  mutated the gene as you mentioned."
cats,flguqpa,t1_flfplui,1585150690.0,"I can’t say for sure if it was the cat who directly caused her death. Obviously, that’s a stretch. I’ve tested for allergies, but have none. I never had any feelings towards this cat, until I was scratched again, and started to develop new symptoms soon after. I mean, it could’ve been the wrong place, wrong time, but I tested for an active infection just three weeks after. I’ve already gotten over my grandmothers death, as it happened years ago. But do feel it’s a bit of a coincidence that she experienced similar symptoms as I did, and was ill before and after her stroke. Yes, I suppose I do channel some anger towards the cat, but I never have before. Only after he bit me, and I began to re-develop symptoms was when I got upset. I seriously wish my parents would bring the cat to a vet, for annual check-ups, because he’s always outside, but they don’t seem keen on the idea. As for the therapist, I may visit one for what I’m experiencing at the moment. I’m already over the grief stage, but having some to talk to would be nice."
cats,flfp5et,t1_flfn8jp,1585112953.0,"Cats are asymptomatic with bartonella and are only active carriers of the disease. My parents told me he has the veterinary care he needs, and he just got his rabies shot a couple months ago. I’ve asked them to bring him in though, and they don’t seem too keen on the idea. I can’t remember the last time my cat saw the vet though, which is very unfortunate."
cats,flfoy0o,t1_flfn8iv,1585112770.0,"No. He bites and scratches in a playful manner but he does draw blood, often. (which I’m sure is common with most cats)"
cats,flfos7f,t1_flfn72z,1585112621.0,"I’ll try to convince my parents to bring the cat in, just to make sure there isn’t anything wrong. I know he got his rabies shot just last year, which I’m thankful for. Bartonella, which is what I’m undergoing treatment for, isn’t dangerous to cats though. Some are active carriers, but they are asymptomatic to it. If my cat was suffering, I would make sure that he was brought in, and would even call the vet myself. Bart is a really stubborn disease when not treated right away, and I’ve developed chronic health issues as a result. Like I said, I’ve had it since 2015. I can see how this post was perceived, and I should’ve understand who my audience was. My brother and my mother both had it as well, which I should have mentioned."
