depression,eu568bx,t3_c2fuf3,1563470765.0,"I understand what you mean. I feel that sometimes you just have to cry it all out until the tears run dry. Do you have a friend to go to? Or sometime to yourself? 

I’ll do my best to understand my sister. But I can’t cannot do anything. What if... never mind. 

All I can say is that you must fight. Although it may seem pointless or unclear. Carry on. I promise it gets easier. After the storm you may understand how you pulled through. Maybe it still hasn’t passed but each day your grow stronger. And I know you can do it b/c you have gone to college. I’m proud of you. You can do it.:)"
depression,eu3p5qx,t3_c2fuf3,1563420958.0,"Just a question here. What would you like for your parents to do? As a parent. How could they help?
 
The depressing feeling I have. I still wouldn’t know how someone could help me. What could they possibly do?? 

Sorry just want to understand"
