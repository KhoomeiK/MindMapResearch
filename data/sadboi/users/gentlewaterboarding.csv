If you're raised in a country where anti-lgbt views are mainstream, and you grow up sheltered without contact with any lgbt people, I imagine it's pretty easy to end up with such views.

And OP is only 18. Few 18 year olds challenge their long held believes with critical thinking.

As a gay dude, I'm neither surprised nor offended that an 18 yo east-european person would hold anti-lgbt believes. Give it time I guess. We're moving in the right direction still."

I dunno. I'm not sure if it's worth it either. It feels like life is more and more work and less and less reward, you know? All my life I've done the right things; I've worked hard in school and gotten good grades, I've stayed in shape. I've done the work. I always thought I was investing in a better future, but there is no pleasure to be seen anywhere now. Nothing to look forward to. As alone as ever, and with fewer friends than ever before. 

I don't know if life is worth living without love. I really don't. Maybe I could beat my depression and find enjoyment by myself. There are certainly others who live meaningful lives alone. But if I can neither find companionship or beat the blues, then the fight is just lost."

It's not that being alone for a while is excruciating -- everyone should be able to handle that just fine. But a lifetime? Having the only thing you've ever desired denied to you again and again?

Disregarding the psychological perspective of not knowing what you're missing out on, which can certainly make this life more torturous, it bottles down to whether a life in solitude is a life worth living. I'm not sure that it is. I do not know how to derive pleasure from anything on my own. Pleasure just doesn't exist in a vacuum."

worldnews,fooinbu,t1_foo2nxs,1587939708.0,"[The article I read which is in Norwegian,](https://forskning.no/angst-depresjon-medisiner/ny-studie-sar-fornyet-tvil-om-medisiner-mot-depresjon/1359079) based on [this Danish article](https://videnskab.dk/krop-sundhed/stoerste-studie-til-dato-antidepressiv-medicin-virker-bedre-end-placebo).

It's a large study which found that 79 % of anti-depressives studies are biased in some form. One of these biases is comparing anti-depressives with _non-active_ placebos in blind studies. That is, placebos that do not aim to copy the side effects of the drug being tested, and thus, a result is no longer blind once side effects (or lack thereof) occurs. Anti-depressive studies using _active_ placebos show a smaller difference in outcomes between the two subject groups. One criticism of this methodology is that it puts the bar pretty high and that most medical studies would be discarded when subject to this scrutiny. 

The article includes statements from a Stanford professor who argues against the Danish researchers. He interprets the pool of studies to imply that the number of patients who see a 50 % or more reduction in their depression is 10-20 % higher in the anti-depressive group vs the placebo group. 

Bottom line is Danish researchers state you can't definitively say anti-depressives actually work. Stanford guy says you can. And I find it discouraging that there isn't consensus in the research community whether or not my only (legal) hope of getting a normal life is actually snake oil."
