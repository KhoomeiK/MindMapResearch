collegeadvice,f4czx5k,t1_f40xcvg,1571536166.0,"Okay I will definitely do more research but during my junior year. Right now I should really focus on my grades but I will eventually get more advice from my school counselor and do more research and then I’ll talk to him. Right now I’m just not going to think about it. If I start thinking about it right now my grades will decrease due to anxiety and stress but I will eventually. Thank you for your advice, I will definitely use it and present a good case to my dad."
collegeadvice,f4czcjl,t1_f41nvt9,1571535939.0,Thank you! I will think about it and I think that’s a good idea.
collegeadvice,f4cz84i,t1_f43q7hv,1571535891.0,It’s just that he isn’t being flexible. Like if I do get a scholarship that knocks down a good chunk he is still not open to it. I want to go into programs that they don’t offer at the community colleges near me. And I was thinking about doing a 4 year college while also going to community college for summer or winter classes to get my degree faster.

Anxiety,ey5hsas,t1_ey5dnn0,1566831991.0,"I guess it kinda does. I have intrusive thoughts quite a lot. But I’ve always been brushing it off. I double triple check almost every single thing I do. Like if I’m going out, I’ll lock my door, come back to lock it again and then after I’m a little far away from my house I’ll come back to check the door. That’s basically what I’ve observed about myself but then again I may be self diagnosing because I’ve never been diagnosed."
Anxiety,ey4lqtc,t3_cvdz52,1566796914.0,"I know and understand what you’re going through. I confide in my friends all the time and I want them to respond and make me feel good but they don’t. They’ll say something like, ”aww that sucks” or, “I’m sorry”. I don’t want them to say that. I want them to make me feel okay. To give me reassurance. I want them to say it’s okay, you’ll live and succeed. At this point after talking to so many people and not getting the response that makes me feel happy and okay, I’ve learned to give myself pep talks. I’ve learned to make myself happy. I talk to myself quite a bit. It helps my anxiety as well as makes me feel more prepared and ready for things. If you ever need a pep talk I’m here. Talk to yourself. It’s amazing."

bisexual,eu4i96e,t1_eu3vi48,1563454710.0,Thank you. It’s nice to know that I’m not the only one.
bisexual,eu4i5mg,t1_eu44fop,1563454626.0,"This is a really good reply. I think it may be more of the second possibility. I’m not a very social person. I have social anxiety so social situations aren’t the best for me. While that is true, I do talk to people but I don’t get close to them. So, my best friend is one of the people I feel comfortable with. That’s probably why I’m attracted to her. We always make jokes about dating each other. We’re always together that’s probably why it seems like we’re already dating. I think it’s the closeness that is causing this attraction. I cannot tell her my feelings. There was a time where she questioned her sexuality, but she decided in the end that she was straight. I don’t want it to be awkward and I don’t want her to feel uncomfortable. This is what I think is happening in my brain right now but if I do get attracted to another girl like her, then I’ll have my answer. But right now, this is going to be the answer I give to myself to resolve this conflict in my brain. Thank you for the reply. It really really helped."
bisexual,eu3srkw,t1_eu3ses3,1563424182.0,"Glad someone can agree. I think I’ve always been into people’s personalities. I’ll think a guy is hot but only if he has a good personality, I will start to like him. That’s how I’ve always been. But this is the first time it’s happened with a girl. I’m 15 so I’m not trying to label myself either but I do I want to be less confused about what I’m really thinking because not understanding is driving me crazy. I’m the kind of person that likes to have everything figured out and when that doesn’t happen I feel uncomfortable and annoyed. Thanks for replying. It’s nice knowing someone out there understands. I haven’t talked to anybody about this so telling reddit made me feel a little better."

relationship_advice,esmtf2y,t1_esmq7z9,1562114283.0,"That’s what I keep saying to myself but she’s on Instagram all day liking my posts and stuff. Like I get if she was busy but she doesn’t really look busy. She also makes posts like haha watched Netflix all day, etc. So idk maybe I’ll just let her be and maybe if she really did like me then she’ll be the first to text."
highschool,esh71t2,t3_c7q2a3,1561984669.0,"I’ll be a sophomore in September. Here is some advice that may help you: 
1. Don’t go in looking for a group of friends or a BFF. You want to be as nice as possible (without being a pushover) to everyone so that you make a lot of friends. Every freshman is scared so you’ll be able to make friends pretty easily. If you glue yourself down to one group of friends then if they turn on you you won’t have anybody else. And honestly having one group of friends isn’t that fun. 

2. It’s not that scary. The teachers are usually nice. There are some teachers that can be dicks but try not to mind them too much. Ask whatever questions you want to ask. They get paid to help you become a smarter, educated person. And if you embarrass yourself in front of them THEY DONT CARE. So, it’s ok. 

3. DONT DATE JUNIORS OR SENIORS. They usually just date freshmen for sex. They are also going to leave for college and your heart will get ripped out. 

4. If you feel like you want to change other’s perception of you then this is the perfect time. I wanted to be more social, actually have friends and help my social anxiety. So, I became more social and now people see me as a very social person that tends to get along with people. 

5. DO YOUR WORK. Especially your home work. Your grades matter. YOUR GRADES MATTER. I cannot stress that enough. People say, “Oh your freshman year doesn’t really count.” Yes. Yes, it does. Good grades will get you into higher level classes which helps you with college. Bad grades will get you into grade level or lower classes. Homework isn’t that hard and it has less points but negative points add up and will cause your grade to lower. Try to take as many honors and ap classes as you can in sophomore year. 

6. Join clubs. They help you make social connections and they make your college resume look good. Also try to volunteer but if you cannot it’s okay. 

7. Upper class people aren’t that bad. Just don’t try to cling to them. Make casual conversation if they seem nice. Some can be dicks. But most are nice and easy to talk to. 

8. Stay organized. Keep an agenda book. 

9. Take a language class. Those are pretty beneficial for college. 

10.  Don’t stress too much. Be social. Find friends. Get good grades. Remember high schoolers are humans too. Most likely they won’t care about what you do. They’ll be more busy worrying about themselves. It’s not that bad. Have fun!"
