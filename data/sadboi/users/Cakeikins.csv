relationship_advice,fqm22r9,t3_gjhg5q,1589470163.0,"No, it is not normal to keep insisting your partner detail their childhood sexual abuse when they are uncomfortable.

I’ve found that stating as much as I was comfortable and saying I’m not going to discuss my past further and if they press it, I’ll leave. 

Good and well intentioned people don’t push this kind of thing. Ever. There is no theory, no reason that any partner would have to demand this out of their partner. If they are, it’s for their own game. 

You are not being paranoid, you are picking up the right signals here. Don’t ignore them."

BorderlinePDisorder,fiqyyu2,t3_f8ez4l,1582654135.0,"As a general rule, people under 18 are not diagnosed with personality disorders as their personalities haven’t fully developed to the point of a consistent pattern of disorder. I don’t mean that in a way of saying what you are feeling or doing isn’t disordered, it’s just more likely to change as you are younger and going through puberty. That’s a good thing, your brain is super elastic right now and can learn so many things. Maybe in the future you’ll be diagnosed with a PD, but as a teen it’s unlikely.

It’s worth mentioning that you have it backwards in the way that you have a diagnosis in mind then go to the doctor to get it confirmed. It’s better to go into the doctor with a list of symptoms and patterns and let them use their knowledge to inform you. You’re the expert on you, their the expert on the rest of that crap.  There are so many mental illnesses out there, and they went to school for it so we don’t have to shoulder that responsibility.

Let your parents know you need help and want to see a doctor. Hopefully they will be supportive with that"

BPD,fgjdtls,t3_eynxa4,1580841955.0,"I’ve been on quetiapine for over ten years, and I can say for it was a mixed bag. It makes me feel totally blank and bleh most of the time which i has considered fine, until I decided I didn’t want to take it recently. 

The reason I was put on it initially was because they suspected I was psychotic, but nope just traumatised and they never removed it. I came off it myself recently and the withdrawal was HORRIBLE. After less than half a week, I agreed to go back on half dose which is already a high one. I found not being on it, then going back on it was incredibly helpful in my trauma recovery as I could actually access my emotions, if that makes sense? It blankets a lot.  

Though why did I go back on them? Other than the horrible withdrawal, I was in town getting some food and there was a stall with cute socks and I full on broke down crying. Like wailing. So. Yeah. 

I don’t know if it’s a chicken and egg situation, but I ballooned when I started them. When I take them, I turn into a hungry hungry hippo and want to eat everything no matter how much I’ve eaten prior. Like the worst munchies.

I guess a small summary would be:
1: Weight increase
2: Appetite increase
3: Muscle twitching (stopped after about a month)
4: Dry mouth
5: ‘Accessing’ emotions, feeling blank common 
6: Increased heart rate 

But, the obvious bonuses are:
1: Functionality in the real world
2: Not everything feels like a fucking nightmare"

Whether she has BPD or not, whether she is ready for therapy or not, it’s not going to happen whether you push her into it. She has to want it. 

Trying to ‘coax’ an apology out of someone isn’t something that’s going to work. Either someone is actually sorry for wronging you or they are not. Attempting to coax it out of someone is manipulative and she recognised that by breaking up with you. 

From what you have written here, you sound very judgmental of this girl, and it’s a question you need to ask yourself why do you want to be with her? It doesn’t sound as though you or she are happy or are acting in the best way."

A lot of my friends that were training in psychology said it was really great as there was a lot of therapy and really getting to understand what they knew about themselves. Then writing a million essays on it.
