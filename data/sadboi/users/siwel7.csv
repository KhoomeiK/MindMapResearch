I (30M) used to do this *all the time* in my twenties, and it's something I like to believe I grew out of... I realised one day that no one really cares (besides family and perhaps very close friends) about me—not necessarily because they don't give an f about me, but rather that they have their own issues (see: lives) to carry on with. Comparing your insides to others outsides isn't healthy thinking.

I've watched my grandpa (one of the nicest men you'd ever meet, without bias) die of kidney failure. It changed me. I realised after he was gone that everything he had done and achieved were all for nothing. I know that sounds very negative or nihilistic, but it is true—besides the memories and memorabilia, what else remains of him? The reason why I bring this up is because he has lived a far greater life (and I base this metric upon the ways I witness him interact with people) than I believe I ever will—and by this ""all for nothing"" way of thinking takes a lot of weight off my back. I don't need to own my own home or drive the latest model car.


FYI: my biggest, current self-imposed judgement is whether or not I'm employed and contributing to society... Where did this judgement come from? I have no idea, but like yourself, you can't really rationalise emotions... They're just... THERE.

>my younger cousin is married and owns a house and lives comfortably

I'm sorry, but this way of thinking is flawed. There is so much happening beyond surface level that it's uncanny—relationship issues, mental and physical health, etc—because who would talk about these issues aloud?



Ask a man living under a bridge about your concern (self-judgement) of living with your mother and he will probably laugh in your face. Practicing gratitude is something I'm still trying to learn the importance of.


I lived with my mother until my mid twenties and indeed felt a lot of self-imposed shame. But since moving out and living with roommates, I realise that I really haven't gained anything. My mother and I were very prone to conflict while I was living with her (which was one reason why I moved out)—which seems to be the opposite of your circumstance—so at least you have options."

Yeah, but not really; there's a saturation point (2-4mg rings a bell?) at which more LSD won't do anything. Google (I'm at work and CBF linking) ""LSD cocaine 1972 coma""; basically a group of people in the US snorted what they *thought* was cocaine but it was actually LSD.
