Chameleons,fr3ma9y,t1_fr3bexp,1589860569.0,"TL;DR - I get you, but please read so you know where I'm coming from, and thank for being decent with your post.  :)

First off, I want to preface by saying that part of my job as a moderator is to *assist* & help new owners, make suggestions and ask questions where I see possibly an intervention is needed.  I know as a new owner, I sure did, and one of the MOD's here, at the time, really laid into me, I still have much respect for him, but he drilled into my head all that I was doing wrong, and I was doing it all wrong, and that includes using a glass tank while I was living in Florida, it was my first cham, I did my research (with that being said, I know where NOT to go look for information anymore), there's crappy misinformation all over the internet, all care sheets say something different, even the pros, Necas, Anderson and Strand all have something different to say, so I get it.  I noticed OP had their cham in a glass tank, so I asked a *concerned* and pretty *innocent* question, I got slammed.  I asked because I care, not to be argumentative, that's where I was coming from, good intentions.

Yep, I hear everything you're saying, this sub is also for helping new owners and often they got to Petco, Pet Supermarket and all of the bad information begins, and generally speaking, when people post questions as to how their set up is, of course everyone is here to help and that's awesome.  We have some **KICK ASS** members here, and some of them belong to a lot of the same FB groups that I do, I say that for a reason.

> The only reason that I’m saying this is because you are going around telling people that if you use a glass enclosure, your Cham will get a respiratory and die. 

Please don't quote me, and if you do, please post *exactly* what I said, and I did not say that specifically, I said it's an issue, it *IS* absolutely plausible, you know that.  Having air flow is better, and I get people have certain situations, but I'm still going to ask because I also don't want them to be me, when I got my first cham.

> Many people also have success with setting up a bioactive setup in these tanks, which use soil and are fine, as a health chameleon will be able to digest small shouts of soil.

I get that as well, and the people who do this, with experience, cool!  Heard of Tamura Designs in LA?  He builds some amazing custom made cages for chameleons of all kinds, expensive, but the systems he's capable of building (and bioactive) are SWEET!!!  New owners *generally* are incapable of knowing **EXACTLY** how to nail this on the first try, never mind buying a chameleon for the first time with all of the crap information you fine when you google ""how to take care of a chameleon"", and the first web site that pops up is...  Ugh!

In ending, don't know if you saw, but I live in Washington state, moved here less than a year ago from Florida, I added a humidifier to my room when I got here, they are in screen, not glass.  They're doing fine, we also had the heat on all winter, so the house was warm, my Panther regulated the way a Panther did, and my Veiled?  Yep, he just hangs out up at the top all day, he likes his basking.  I've dealt with an RI before as well, in Florida, AC and my Panther weren't mixing, but he's still here and kicking it.  I've also learned some crappy lessons along the way and I remember when I first started, I researched and thought I was good, NOPE!!  Lol!  

Anyway, my point is that I'm just looking out, others took it way to far as to *why* I asked the question.  *""No good deed goes unpunished.""*  

I get you, I got it, and I understand you, but one question, which was literally a sentence long, was a hell of a lot shorter than this response, and bottom line that many missed?  I asked that question because I just wanted to make sure OP and the animal were good.  Glass enclosures are not suggested, everyone knows that, yes, in some situations, you have to.  I don't know if OP knows that and I just want to make sure they're good.  I got verbally rammed because I ask a question out of care and concern."

If anything, while giving advice here (I often have to watch what I write and how I write it when giving instructions), we have to keep in mind that we are all not professionals, but we trust that we know what we're doing, I get it, however, the person on the other side of our computer screen might misinterpret what we're saying.

Our founding MOD, flip69, even PM'd me on the side one day to pretty much tell me the same thing, ""Dex, be careful of what you share with others, we don't know if they *REALLY* know/understand what we're telling them...""

Their bite has little pressure, their teeth are also super small, they can't move their jaws from side to side, only up and down and even for chameleons, that chomping up and down is for crushing, not demolishing, if that makes sense. [They are sloppy eaters, truly?  They don't care](https://digg.com/video/common-chameleon-animation).  That video is spot on while being humorous.  

With any animal, if they bite, make sure you know how to handle the situation, whatever the animal is; dog, cat, lizard, bird, etc., always be familiar with being safe for yourself and your animal.  <3"

How old is that cham, and where did you get him?  You've never owned a reptile, chameleons are NOT BEGINNER reps, and this cham looks like it should still be with it's clutch, you might need to make some adjustments in the meantime and if you can, go over the sidebar, I do not doubt that there are many things that you're probably missing that no has shared with you.

Most cases, when you get a new animal home (chameleon), not matter what their age is, they're going to need time to adjust, and that can be anywhere from 2-4 days.  They just left their clutch, they don't know where they are, they don't know who you are (good news though, they do learn to recognize their owner, and handling is helpful, start doing that in the next week, will give you a link), they just need some time to chill, but again, in the meantime, *post some pictures*, let's get a look at him, make sure he's healthy and that you're off to a good start with everything.  ;)
