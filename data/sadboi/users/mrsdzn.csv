You and your husband will go through this and move on in time. Hold on to each other and look forward to the future. Together you will overcome this and become stronger ❤️
Miscarriage,ff6twrb,t1_ff6thba,1579634797.0,"Take all the time you need to grieve and talk about it with someone, it helps."
Miscarriage,fc0ob0o,t3_efd2g9,1577295775.0,"Love this, thank you."
Miscarriage,fb5eq5t,t3_ebjw0o,1576526258.0,I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's been 10 day since I miscarried and it does get easier to talk about it. I'm lucky my husband is here to support and listen to me. And if you're comfortable sharing what happened to your close friends / relatives. It does help. Venting out helps release your emotions and those are valid emotions.
Miscarriage,fb5d741,t3_ebhdwt,1576525459.0,"Everything that you feel is valid. It’s valid to be excited, to feel silly, to feel empty, to feel disappointed. You have to go all through that to move on tbh. You can’t just hide those emotions or pretend. It’s been 10 days since I miscarried, I was 6-7 weeks and I can tell you it hurts slightly less everyday."
Miscarriage,fb0hhm5,t3_eax9v3,1576426092.0,"I’m so sorry you’re going through this. I lost mine not too long ago. There’s not a day since that don’t think about it but I can tell you it hurts less as time passes by. My advice is to just be honest, tell your boss or colleagues to give you time and space to grieve."
Miscarriage,fau8shp,t1_fapv7ai,1576345728.0,That’s great advise on feeling emotionally ready. That hit me.
Miscarriage,fau8lkd,t1_faps2ki,1576345660.0,That’s so great to hear!! I’m truly happy for you.
Miscarriage,fapodfz,t3_eacve3,1576291065.0,"I also lost mine at 6-7 weeks and my  bleeding stopped. I believed all tissues are out, I don’t feel any pain or cramping. I want to start right away tbh."
Miscarriage,f9ykbp5,t1_f9xfjg8,1575729831.0,"I think I’m going to feel “empty” for a while. I know it will get better and reading you reply is reassuring, thank you."
Miscarriage,f9yilvz,t1_f9x92qj,1575729163.0,"Just reading this made my heart hurt. I secretly recorded my husband when I told him, I have photos of my pregnancy tests. I have an app that tracks my period/pregnancy, yesterday I had to turn off “pregnancy mode” I bawled before clicking the button."
Miscarriage,f9yhlgx,t1_f9wy0rn,1575728760.0,"So sorry to hear that! I had an elaborate announcement plan as well. I can picture the joy on the faces of my family and friends, clear as day. I couldn’t wait for that time to arrive. Thanks for your reply. I feel a tad better knowing it’s just not me because sure it feels that way."
Miscarriage,f9ygxfe,t1_f9wtn7g,1575728499.0,"It’s so easy to blame yourself and hate your body but I realized I needed to get stronger and healtier to try again. Thank you so much, this means a lot."
