asd,ffyo62i,t3_evteo3,1580351083.0,"Autism is a on a continuum like Dr Temple Grandin says. She wrote many books and audio books on autism. To me personally at least, everyone is on this continuum even if you aren't diagnosed or eating an entire bag of chips, bag included (a story with someone diagnosed with intense autism I've heard somewhere else where the individual would eat the bag and the food inside if not monitored)."
AutisticAdults,ffdha5p,t3_ess7at,1579820842.0,"celph titled, hed pe and scarling and dr temple grandin are soothing methods of discussing autism without having to talk."
Autistic,ffcnr16,t3_esqo0x,1579803371.0,"looks don't always have to mean so much, generally speaking. what matters more than looks is our older senses of sound/hearing and taste. vision hasn't always existed despite the imagination imagining itself anyway it pleases to the extent that it can I 'spose. we all 'go through' ""it"" whatever ""it"" is. even the most smooth talking or 'pleasent looking' of us experience this. really the general term for this human social ape experience is ""the blues"".

socially progressive hip hop and other music also adds a lot of flavor to personal dialogue and conversation with others. Such as mos def, cunninlynguists, passion pit, buddy guy.

susan caine quiet talks about our collective human nature efficently.

Dr Temple Grandin is autistic herself and talks about the language of the brain being 90% genetics 10% variation environmental, verbal, non verbal and biological.  


also the movie Aluna is my current ancestors from Bogota Colombia bringing a collective socially mutual spiritual perspective to conversation. It's in youtube.

Struggling is a part of life, just know for a fact that you never really do it alone unless you make a choice to do so. Much respect your way bruh."
schizophrenia,fbkza8u,t3_edpjdu,1576956746.0,"Not to man splain' but music can be therapuetic and soothing to the soul. Also taking hot and cold showers together as you experiment with whatever amount of hot and cold you desire. Can help fulfill inner primal desire for expression and recognition. It may sound simple or weird but you can try it. I've learned over the years that I just can't simply take only hot showers anymore...generally. It's ebb and flow you already understand or can figure out your own way.

But for some audio stuff check out David Goggins, Symphony of Science Terrence McKenna, The Flashbulb, Temple Grandin, Susan Cain, Jane Goodall, RWBY ost, Jazz and Between The Buried And Me (potentially triggering so read the lyrics first if you so desire)."
schizophrenia,fbk00gv,t1_fbjphja,1576942717.0,I'm not trying to turn this into a dumpster fire of a conversation or a spectacle of one. Please if you really care message me directly. Public conversation is the quickest and easiest way to hide or misdirect intent.
schizophrenia,fbjbz5r,t1_fbja5ej,1576930147.0,Hey bro this is just theory if you don't like it move along. It's open source flow if you will.

schizophrenia,fbeph4o,t1_fbel61t,1576790904.0,"Neither. The internet generally ended the need for verbal identity already or nouns really. The English language can be unnecessarily dualistic, schadenfreudenistic, and tautologistic. It needs a book to understand human sincerity/conversation called ""the dsm iv""."

depression,f7nyw2v,t3_dwzkde,1573917769.0,The tao and Buddhism or sayings of daoism are very fluid techniques or ways of balance when out amongst other people. Potentially even more so when alone. Like the first writtings in the tao of Jeet kune do by Bruce lee which you can Google the PDF of.
BPD,f6oza84,t3_dsc3xu,1573042142.0,Hot and cold water can help you cry less when you shower. The amount of either is yours to determine and experiment with.
