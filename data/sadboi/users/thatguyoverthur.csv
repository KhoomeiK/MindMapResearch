Started with a hybrid, Sirrus sport. Fine bike, but a hybrid. Upright riding position, heavy and flat bars. All fine, but not ideal.

I'm now on a gravel road bike. I went this route cause, lighter, aero drop bars and I wanted to do group rides and hill climbs.

The coop bikes are a good value. I'd also look at Jamis bikes at that price point (renegade in steel!)

Components; everything modern Shimano is good. More expensive = lighter, crisper shifting. Tiagra and up is where I'd look. 

Frame material is the only spot I'll die on a sword; aluminum isn't that good, except for price point. Stiff, not that light and ugly welding (generally...)
Steel has a nice organic feel, very smooth.
Carbon can have some smooth overtones, but I've also ridden rock hard carbon bikes (Kona).
Never tried titanium, but supposedly smooth like steel but a little lighter.

For your price point, Jamis Renegade in steel comes in a little higher but would be tiagra, steel and mechanical disks."

Keep that bike for trips. Get a faster sexy carbon, steel or ti bike for longer rides. Sounds like you like to ride, and any good hobby is worth investing in.
