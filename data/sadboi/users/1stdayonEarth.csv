But you need to know that there will be down times and not to take the money out (unless you really need to, but it's better to put a small amount of money that you know you won't need than investing too much and after have to withdraw it (happened to me)). Just keep investing mainly if the price gets lower (dollar cost averaging). But I would worry about your debt first (at least the bigger ones like CC debt). If you are debt free, investing is a very nice way to compound your money. Do a calculation on a compounder calculator and you will be amazed. 
The most important thing when investing is having a long term minset. With a SP50P ETF you are betting on the american economy which is very strong and history shows that overtime the index goes higher, so I consider that a relatively safe investment.

nasusmains,fp5gxzc,t3_gbc28o,1588328995.0,"First reason to main a champion is because you like.it. Other it is because you are good at it. Nasus main thing is wave management. He relies on it to have stacks and avoid harassement from the laner, which 90% of the time is stronger than nasus pre 6. 

After lvl 6 and sheen, you should be able to come on top if the cs is close to your laner. 

So why nasus? Because he has a very powerful mid game, he is tanky and does damage and he is as well a good split pusher.

Why not? Although there are ways to minimize this, he 
is still easily kitable and prone to cc, so you have to play around your enemies cooldowns or flank them on the right way to win a teamfight, since nasus is not a strong teamfighter, he is more like a 1 vs 3 champion. He is slow as well, so that's why flanking the enemy in the right way is so important. Also, late game nasus can have huge problems due to adcs scaling or the fact the toplaner has better late game (trynda, jax, camille, fiora, kayle, etc...). Maybe wither the adc and e him for your team to jump on him is not a bad idea (if the adc is the fed one anyway and you can reach to him).

I worry more about some of the signs on your face. It's not a huge thing, but without them you would look slightly better.
You have a pretty face and I believe you don't have much to worry about."
MakeNewFriendsHere,fndyq0h,t1_fndm8ij,1586879956.0,"I have ghosted people myself. I am no saint. And it was indeed due to mostly me feeling I wasn't a good company. But I want to be more selective this time and don't worry the other person in case I am not interested in him/her. The ugly truth is the way to go. You might do a bit more effort, but at least the person will feel more at ease instead of just asking to him/herself why. Sometimes ghosting just happens due to lack of connection in the first conversation and I believe in this case it's maybe more acceptable if you feel the other person wouldn't care about you that much anyway.
And I don't mind for people to be open. I even like it more that way, even if it's a bad thing. Because I know it's something that is not easy to do, so if a person does this, he/she has my respect."

MakeNewFriendsHere,fn6lmhk,t1_fn6itwi,1586702291.0,"Like there are stuff I can speak with male and stuff I can speak with female. Like most stuff you can speak to both. But if in certain situations I speak with a male the same way I speak with a female, it will be a bit weird. But 80% of the stuff you can speak with both genders. Although there are some ways to talk you only should do with a specific gender. But depends very much on the nature of the conversation. It's nothing personal or discrimination. Depends very much on the person as well."
MakeNewFriendsHere,fn60131,t1_fn3xgbr,1586682133.0,"I think gender is important. I know it might attract unwanted attention, but that's up to the person to be selective. I don't talk to both genders the same way. So I feel it's an important thing."

nasusmains,fn1ljkd,t3_fyqp39,1586564593.0,In my opinion it would be a 1 vs 2 lane. Nasus would be useless and you wouldn't have enough poke for 2 enemies. But this is what I think. You can try it and see how it works. It should work well in lanes that have low pressure or poke.
nasusmains,fn1l9is,t1_fn14fgl,1586564418.0,I play so much vs morde and I never paid attention to any of this.
Vent,fn1kz54,t1_fn1kpea,1586564240.0,Ok good enough for me. I would definitely not judge. Like a person is a person regardless of the country. It's sad if people don't understand that. I was just curious because I am from Europe too. I am not from the same region tho.

Is this in the US?

In any case,. it's really disgusting the nerve that he had to contact you in anyway. But I am glad that you got it out of your system. There's no need to think about it anymore. The only way is to move on. You want to decompress what you need, but you don't want to have it all in your head. You are very young still, so just think about how are you going to live your life and fulfill your dreams from now on."

Well what he did was disgusting. Just block him and move on. There's no use to think about it anymore. I am glad you got it out of your system."
Vent,fn1er8d,t1_fn121uj,1586560488.0,"How is that possible tho? No judgement at all? He should be arrested no matter how you try to look at it. Why did the police let him go? What happened there? Did he had a license or he just didn't take it while he was driving? I wouldn't certainly be happy with a guy who ended my partner's life living carefree.

I am sorry for you. I really am. But I don't feel it's fair that he didn't pay for his crime. Even if it was unintentional, he was careless and killed a person."
careeradvice,fn1dbg6,t1_fn1bii0,1586559648.0,"When I said some people don't have good judgement for themselves, I mean that people there's a group of people that usually is poor at making decisions (probably something related to personality) (I can say that at least in the past I have made poor decisions and judgments, so at that time I probably should have entrusted the decision to others [maybe?]). And besides, if people say similar things, there's probably something you are missing? But depends if you feel the person you are talking to as good judgement or not. 

I guess that if either you make a poor or good choice you learn either way. But the cost of it in some cases might be too high. I guess it depends on the individual capacity of getting back on the right track I suppose? 
My personal case is my bachelor's. I chose the wrong one. It's a topic that I felt I would be passioned about. But after I saw the jobs it had and I was kind of turned of. I have a bachelor's in a area I don't like or either has amazing job offers. My second thinking was going to something finance related or It, which I feel I would have done a better job. Although I think the best decision at the time was not going to college because I was too much over my head. And just take some time off to take care of myself and just feel ready to make the right call."
careeradvice,fn1a2xh,t1_fn13f5l,1586557801.0,"But that's my point: some people don't have good judgment for themselves. Like if you don't have a strong opinion on a subject, you have two options: explore on the matter deeply and decide for yourself (you are forced to take a decision even if you feel you aren't good at it) or just go with a person's opinion that you can agree more on.
You can always take time just to think and explore at ease before making a decision"
careeradvice,fn0jint,t3_fyffj8,1586543093.0,"Yea some people have poor judgment. Like I did when choosing a bachelor's. So yea, depends on your judgment. Sometimes and depending on the person, you may want to listen closely to what they have to say. You have the right to decide, but... Be sure to think things through."
nasusmains,fmzv4zc,t1_fmzpsb8,1586530176.0,Yea a thing I forgot to mention. Her ult is so frustrating... Trying to bait her ult is a good option. She doesn't ult you to the fountain tho haha unless you are near base. One trick that can be done is like to stay behind her and wait for her ult and after you flash in front of her when she ults.
