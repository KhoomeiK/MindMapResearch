Advice,fps6yee,t1_fpqrwl4,1588868499.0,"I agree engineering has its uses and that's also what worries me the most of doing Psych. Most people don't love blunt answers, but I can appreciate that. Feels like I have a long road with engineering even though it's close. Thank you for responding."
Advice,fps6jgy,t1_fpqs7fc,1588868301.0,"Yea, that's what took me awhile to learn with friends and family. I was thinking about changing schools too, but I've heard horror stories about credits carrying over. I also just figure I should just face my problems instead of walking away from it. I let people change me. I didn't change myself.

Thank you for the responses mate."
Advice,fpql69n,t1_fpq378m,1588825398.0,"At first I went to college because of the money. I'm not going to lie about that. I was a STEM kid in high school so engineering was the right choice. Atleast that's what I thought. Eventually it just felt like everything was kinda fake. I didn't like the people. Friends had agendas. Family had expectations.

Whether I'm right or not it just seems like I let everyone define what I should be. I guess I really put this up because I'm not sure who to really trust anymore. It's to the point I'd rather trust a stranger than even my own blood. I appreciate the answer though. It has more substance than what most people ever give me. I guess I just want to find a balance of what I want, but also that efficiency I used to have when I thought I knew what I really wanted. Also any advice if it doesn't sound like a good idea anyways. I'm not always right."
