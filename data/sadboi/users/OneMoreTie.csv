BipolarReddit,fn04qfa,t3_fygyah,1586535422.0,Happy birthday you brilliant human! Well bloody done. You deserve nothing but the best today. May it be happy.
bipolar2,f1hpupa,t1_f1djmex,1569498679.0,I'm very glad :)
bipolar2,f1dc4ic,t3_d8vntp,1569379527.0,"I know you explicitly don't want to hear something about how you're precious, or life is precious, or some shit like that. But the truth is I haven't walked a goddamn centimetre in your shoes, so what do I know? What do I know about all the suffering, the disappointment, the wearing you down. What do I know about if your life has just become a fucking burden, and what you really want is euthanasia? I don't man.

So I'm not going to tell you that you're precious cuz it don't matter what I think. All that matters is what you think and how you feel. I just want to say this. Your disease is trying to kill you. Imagine a life where you didn't feel like this. It might be hard as hell to, but try. A life like normal people, where you didn't suffer, where it wasn't just one long empty road.

That life is denied to you because of a mental illness. A chemical imbalance in your brain. So I'm going to be an annoying jackass and say just this: What if you could find a way to fight the disease. Fuck 'feeling better' or 'caring more about yourself'. You have a disease, a sickness and its ruining the time you have left. Will going somewhere really make you feel better? You'll carry this wherever you go.

You want amazing experiences, what about a lifetimes worth of them. What about holding your own kid in your arms. Or falling in love. Or having great sex. What about every fucking sunset and yeah, every disappointment and wonderous sight and sound and smell that you got maybe another fifty years worth of. I'm sorry man, I can't just let you be okay with this disease finishing you off. So I just want you to try- try and tell your folks how you feel. Try and find medication that helps. Try everything and if it doesn't work, fine, sayonara you beautiful fucking person.

Personally I've felt like the only choice left is to say goodbye. Nothing else was left for me. But then I learned that that very mindset was a terrible illusion, a mental illusion caused by fucked up demons. I got treated, I took medication, I saw a psychiatrist and now I'm living with the love of my life with a steady job. And I thank that goddamn warrior every day for fighting through that darkest part of my life so I could travel the world and climb mountains and have mediocre sex. You're in it right now buddy. This is what the toughest part feels like.

When you go on your adventures, at the end of this all. I want you to ask yourself if its worth giving up all the future adventures you could have. Drive around in a maserati all night again. Travel again. And if it feels like ash in your mouth, if there ain't no motivation left. Its not about the experiences, its about whats in your head. Look around at all the people that don't want to die. Its because they aren't ill. You never chose to feel this way but you can choose to fight it right to the end. And I reckon you are. Because you're seeking happiness in the midst of it all.

And if you made it this far and you still hate this post, my advice on what to do is simple. Take your family, your friends, or whoever you love somewhere special. Say anything you've never had the guts to say, tell them you love them if you do. Make a happy memory with them. Leave something behind, something bright.

Good luck man. If you want you can PM anytime. Please do. Please keep posting here, right up until its over. Document it man.

Don't give up on hope."
bipolar,f1db3bw,t3_d8wzo9,1569378695.0,It's beautiful.
bipolar2,f1dazw2,t3_d8x2ur,1569378619.0,"Hey brother, that sounds rough. FWIW I reckon if you were untreated it was your disease that made your marriage so difficult, not you. You weren't in control man, try not to beat yourself up too much. Keep posting here, you aren't alone. I'm so glad you're getting treatment and understanding what your triggers are, and yeah, you won't always know where your mind is at. But the part of you that tries to know, that 'observer' that wants to better, that is your best self, so even when its total chaos I hope you remember that it isn't your fault and you're just dealing with a disease."
bipolar2,ewu5us2,t1_ewu4vbm,1565765719.0,"Good luck buddy. You can do this. Don't give up, you'll come out of this okay. You're playing life on hard mode but you can beat it. Don't give up! All my love."
bipolar2,ewu5sdc,t3_cq3bj5,1565765632.0,"Bro you've been working and searching for jobs DESPITE your disease. You're my fucking hero. I can't even work many days, even though I know I should. But you still go and apply? Dude that's inspiring.

Ashamed my ass, you're a legend. I hope you DO get your bipolar treated. Keep trying to find therapists because medication could turn it around. You've been doing great all things considered though- just don't give up. You haven't before, so don't now. Take a breath but you sure as fuck aren't worthless or less. I'm serious about being a baddass. I personally find it so hard to get a job or even pursue one and it took me ages, years and years to have even a remotely stable employment- till I was 26 in fact. And you're 18 and look what you have done.

Keep at it. Rejection is hard, but you've taken it before and you can take it again. 

You talked about your personality, but it sounds like to me your personality is you're a tenacious person. I've quit loads of jobs man- because thats what the disease does, some shit is so much harder for us and people that don't have mental illnesses might not get that. It does not make you less because you are trying despite that."
bipolar2,ewu5iww,t3_cq3kzm,1565765302.0,"You sound depressed bud, I'm sorry you're going through that right now. It's not your fault, for what it's worth, and it sucks you have to now go through a depressive bout. Everything is pointless for me when I'm really depressed as well, so your description makes total sense to me. But you know what, any act of self-care you do IS beautiful, brave and worthwhile. I mean that. 

If you clean up your room one iota, you're a fucking champ. If you go for a walk, even a short one, you defeated a demon. You got chains holding you back and smoke in your head, it's a challenge, and your courage and strength and greatness is measured by how you respond to it, and simply enduring counts. You don't have to do a damn thing. 

Anyone in your situation would feel similarly; it does not make you less to feel what you feel and be held down- its chemicals in your brain, it's the disease. Even if you play video games, even if you eat a sandwich, you know how hard that shit is to do now. So maybe tap into your rational mind and ask yourself what would be good for you, EVEN though it feels hard and pointless. If you can do even a little of that, you did something truly, truly worthwhile. Take it from someone whose been there, hell I was there this morning. I reckon not as far gone as you, because I've had worse days recently and this one was alright, but I dragged my ass to the gym, though two days ago I was stuck in a chair for an hour and getting out of that chair was victory enough.

I hope it doesn't last too long bud. I really do. Till then, you post, you read, and you try to take care of yourself best you can. 

For what it's worth my doc has told me not to smoke weed as bipolar, and it might be worth checking with your doc whether it is ok. It could very well be making things worse! Even if it helps unipolar depression, it could be different for us.

You fight on man, you endure, and I hope it passes; it will pass. And you don't have to do a damn thing to be worthwhile, as far as I am concerned you already are worthwhile. All my love."
bipolar2,ewu53iy,t3_cq5f8u,1565764788.0,"This isn't TMI! Anything that you have to navigate due to your bipolar is not TMI, but likely a shared experience that others have had before. And in this case, I have had a similar issue. I think it can be tough in a relationship, and it is actually quite sweet that part of the issue is that you WANT to make your boyfriend feel intimate with you.

But this isn't your fault, and if your bf loves you he will understand that. Its a terrible side effect, but other couples have problems with sex that are due to other causes, including it being painful or traumatic for one or the other partner. One of the solutions is to try to find other ways to make each other feel physically intimate, as an alternative way to feel intimacy. 

It might be that with time you will adjust to your meds and your drive will come back, it could also be that this part of a cycle or mood episode at the moment, or a depressive bout (which has a huge effect on sex drive) and if it passes you will feel better. Definitely talk to your psychiatrist and see if there are alternatives. But if you're looking for advice maybe you should 'expand' your net to investigate people who have trouble having sex for all sorts of reasons and how they cope with it, since this could be an issue with solutions others have found. My heart goes out to you and your boyfriend, but you guys CAN get through this and in no way are you a terrible girlfriend. Show your bf you care about him in all the ways you can anyway, or just cuddle, watch a movie, do things that are physical if not all the way sexual. Also, you could always erm...'tend to him' yourself, even without a drive. I've personally (TMI WARNING) given oral to a girl even if I wasn't horny, but it's satisfying to pleasure someone else. I bet his sadness isn't just sex, but because he cares and it's hard to see someone you care about suffer. Try not to fall into the trap of feeling guilty about your feelings because its not you, its the condition. You wouldn't feel guilty about having a broken leg right? Or diabetes? It's the same. 

All my best bud, I hope things improve for you as a couple :)"
bipolar2,esqhd5d,t3_c8qxtj,1562202509.0,"This ain't your fault. This is not your goddamn fault. You hear me? You never chose to be born with this illness, just as much as no one chooses Parkinsons or Alzheimer's. You got a bit unlucky, is all. But maybe you're lucky in other ways. If you're up for it, try and think of just one small thing you can be grateful for. Hell, whether you believe in anyone to be grateful for them.

I'm scared too. Sometimes there isn't a reason for it. Because our minds are playing tricks on us and fear sucks. But you sound strong as fuck. I can feel it through your words, you're struggling and you WANT to get better. And that's step one. Know you're worth getting better. This is not your fault, its genetics. Your mind can sometimes be your enemy and the tough part is that it is a part of you, but at the same time it isn't. That it's not your fault but it can be your responsibility. This is the line you're going to have to navigate for awhile. 

It isn't your fault. I'll say it again. You aren't alone because sometimes I think it's my fault too. If I was just a little bit stronger. Or a little bit more motivated or took care of myself. But courage is not the absence of fear and strength is measured against adversity, not in spite of it. You want to go back? Keep moving forward, that's what you're doing. Your future self is going to look back and thank you for moving forward. 

You say every decision that you make is out of fear, but you're here and you want to not make decisions out of fear. That is by definition evidence that you are trying. And trying is enough. Fight the fuck on sister. 

Post here. Read here. Let it out because you aren't alone. Everything you wrote about how you feel rings true for me as well. I'm so sorry about your current struggles and family issues as well. But those meds aren't you enemies, they're a tool, they're one more weapon in your arsenal, one more source of support. As others have said, keep the faith and try to be patient. If this drug doesn't work out there are others. There are things you can add to your life. You don't have to switch into a gym-going positive thinking CBT master overnight, but all these little steps amount to something. Know that even with all these obstacles there are paths to dealing with them better.

It's clear and noteworthy that you're starting to try and understand yourself better, and I want to say that I'm proud of you for working, for getting up and for supporting your family despite the illness. That in of itself is very impressive and worthy of celebration. You're scared but you're fighting, and that's a hell of a thing.

Your feelings are legitimate even if they don't make sense. That fear is not your choice but it may sometimes be your reality. You are not just your illness, you are the will to be better, to feel better. That will is more than your illness. If it felt good to write, then maybe you should write more. Keep a journal, hell, keep a blog, even if you don't share it with anyone. Find what works for you because this is also a personal journey, but know that it isn't necessarily a solitary one. You aren't alone, look, all of us here with our own stories.

If you want to rant, someone to talk to, advice of any kind or whatever feel free to PM me. Best of luck, never give up."
bipolar2,esqggjd,t3_c8lkjh,1562202000.0,I'm so fucking sad this morning for no good reason. But I told myself that I can come on here and write one encouraging post and maybe it'll be worth it. I am currently trying so hard to fulfill my dream of being a writer but its really tough keeping faith and working every day with no promise of reward. But I'm going to write for just 25 minutes today even though I'm down and maybe tomorrow it'll get better. I hugged my girlfriend and made her coffee. I don't know. I know this feeling will pass and I'm not going to beat myself up about it today. Thank you so much to everyone who is a part of this community
bipolar2,esqg6kp,t3_c8r49p,1562201851.0,"Try to keep in mind that everyone reacts differently to medication, which is another way of saying that your genes, biology and lifestyle will react differently to different methods and that's okay. You know the fact that you are trying makes all the difference. Never give up on medication, proud of you for going for one that is a bit intimidating.

Personally I've never taken lithium, but the biggest change in my life came from going on the right meds and sticking to it. I used to be single and unable to have a romantic relationship, no friends, barely eating, suicidal, unemployed to the opposite today and 90% was medication. It took 2 years to find the right one but I promise you it is UTTERLY LIFE ALTERING! So stick with it bud. And do take it- side effects can diminish over time but you body needs to adjust. Again, you're doing the right thing. Stick with it more than anything. Remember, no matter how dark the day is or how tough it gets, you come on here and you read and post and above all take your medication. That's all you gotta do some days. Have faith and never give up! My best buddy."
