AskReddit,ezq1v4j,t1_ezq1dxo,1568053561.0,"I suppose I enjoy it most, especially in the later seasons, for the character development and philosophical events more than the plot of each individual episode, if that makes sense.  I agree that it is quite formulaic. I guess the technical language doesn't bother me as much because I am a medical student but I agree it is probably not easy for most to understand! Hope that helps, I would encourage you to keep watching and see what you think, lots happens in the last few seasons!"
