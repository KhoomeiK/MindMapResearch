depression,ewnf25o,t3_cp1ajy,1565576435.0,"Yes, all the time. Even my own good friends make me feel like they like each other more than they like me."
depression,ewnev7g,t3_cml6ni,1565576282.0,"Battling a pretty severe bout of depression lately. I didn’t realize how bad it was until tonight. I’m hurting and broken and lonely. I don’t want to die, I’m not suicidal, but I sometimes think about dying or just not existing at all and how much better life would be for people who have to deal with me"
sex,eqxh8wh,t1_eqxgz64,1560369328.0,I can believe it. I get told this constantly. Constantly told to “have fun” and lower my standards. I’d rather be single and sexless for the rest of my life than have casual sex. That’s who I am and I hate that I’m shamed for it.
polyfamilies,eqxfh9y,t1_eqxf5jc,1560368608.0,"You can’t throw blanket judgement over every friendship like that, though. You may have had one or more similar situation turn sour, but you can’t predict the future. You don’t know either one of us. 

In fact, we had a good conversation just about an hour ago. We are happy and that’s all that matters. I also have a date this weekend."
sex,eqx9p02,t1_eqx7saa,1560366755.0,"Ah. Ok. Well, I get what you’re saying, I just wanted to make sure you know I’m not the guy."
sex,eqx9i3c,t1_eqx9afz,1560366694.0,"I’d believe I was just meeting a strange pool, BUT all of my female friends feel the same way. All of them. Even the married ones."
sex,eqx4vlx,t1_eqx4rqo,1560365172.0,Why did you write this like I’m the dude?
polyfamilies,eqwvoae,t1_eqwusxb,1560362094.0,"We have already had that conversation. 

1. He or his wife close the marriage. Can be any time, for any reason. Or if I decide I’m not into it anymore. 

2. I find someone who I see potential with. He will be informed of any potential dates and how they go. (This has already happened once.)"
polyfamilies,eqwma4a,t1_eqwm38r,1560358821.0,How am I “stringing him along?” He knows I am monogamous. He knows I am looking for someone to marry. We have had very open conversations about this from the start. He supports it and understands that this isn’t long term.
TwoXChromosomes,eqwh899,t1_eqwfccb,1560357057.0,"Most of the time, yes. It starts with kissing, touching, then I go down on him, then he puts on a condom and we do the deed."
sex,eqwh061,t1_eqwfzo2,1560356981.0,"That honestly wouldn’t bother me. I have tasted myself to see what that’s like and there isn’t nearly as much to it like there is in semen. One guy said he didn’t like the taste of pussy he had tried before but he understood the trade off, so he kept a glass of whiskey nearby for quick swigs. It did interrupt the rhythm, but his willingness to try was sexy. Vaginas are naturally wet, so I’m having a hard time with this comparison from the start. If he doesn’t like the taste, I’d find it hard to believe he would enthusiastically lick me. I don’t need to cum from it. I don’t squirt. I don’t need his tongue *in* me. It’s just not a fair comparison."
sex,eqwdg3o,t1_eqwd3a5,1560355854.0,I think you hit the nail on the head! But we are all in our mid-30’s.
TwoXChromosomes,eqwcpaa,t1_eqwc24e,1560355631.0,I think that might be part of it. Maybe foreplay needs to start with me receiving because most guys get head and they’re ready to fuck immediately.
sex,eqwcgu6,t1_eqwc8co,1560355561.0,"I can’t do that. I deal STD’s and pregnancy far too much. On top of that, I need a solid foundation of trust before I am ready for sex."
sex,eqwbb30,t1_eqwapfs,1560355188.0,"I’m still great at giving but I cannot swallow. I will puke. Some guys seem to think that “ruins” it, which I just don’t understand. I just cannot handle the smell/taste/texture/warmth/shooting action. But I will suck the skin off a clean dick if the man shows me he is into it. If he is a dead fish, forget it. Even though it isn’t my favorite, I’m fairly submissive so seeing someone wiggle and moan with pleasure definitely turns me on."
sex,eqwax8b,t1_eqwafie,1560355071.0,"As mentioned in my post, asking up front (before you’re actually naked) is problematic because the men I encounter do not understand that a question doesn’t mean that you’re ready to fuck them right that minute. I don’t want to get naked and THEN find out, but I also don’t want to bring it up too soon. 

Even the men who claim they do/will often forget allll about it the minute I finish giving them head."
polyfamilies,eqtak2s,t1_eqtahza,1560306814.0,"We aren’t in a relationship, but do you mean that you think we should end our friendship?"
polyfamilies,eqsqxuh,t1_eqsqabx,1560291495.0,"Hey, thanks! This comment has been very helpful and I feel like you didn’t project your own situations onto ours. Thank you!

He is very easy to talk to, even about the tough stuff, so I think that a conversation (in person) should happen soon. I would be pretty sad if he decided that we couldn’t be friends, but he has known from the very beginning that I don’t want a relationship so I think he will be very kind and really stay open to being friends. He was pretty supportive when I went on a date a few months ago and equally bummed when it didn’t work out. We have great communication which is so helpful! I also know that he or his wife has the power to close the marriage at any time, so I’ve accepted that as well. 

The last thing I want to do is hurt him or myself. If anything, I think this friendship has taught me a few things. 1) Men who want to make time for me will always find a way. 2) Communication from day 1, even with the hard stuff, saves a lot of confusion and heartbreak. 3) Even if I got married tomorrow, no one is truly “mine.” There’s nothing I can say or do to make someone stay if they don’t want to. It’s been very good for my mental health and I’m grateful to take these lessons with me, no matter what comes next!"
polyfamilies,eqsok37,t1_eqsn0vl,1560289769.0,"Oh no, you got me wrong on that part, but that’s ok! I don’t want him to leave his wife. I know that I don’t want to be poly. I’m just wondering how to handle the current situation until we end things. He knows that I am not poly, as does his wife. She even asked what happened to the guy I went on a date with. If anything, I’ve always accepted that he won’t “change.” I even said in my post that I know he isn’t “mine” and he never will be and I’m ok with that. I accepted it from day 1. He’s just wonderful and I enjoy being around him, so I don’t want to cut things off, but I also don’t want a full-blown relationship. 

I think maybe you’re reflecting on your own lifestyle/relationships and applying that to this situation, but it’s a bit different. Maybe poly isn’t even the right term. They’re just open. Neither one has another partner right now and they haven’t yet, but they do go out with other people."
polyfamilies,eqsgdu3,t1_eqsg3g0,1560284291.0,"That’s a good point. He does know that I have tried dating and going on various apps, but it’s rough out there! 

I’m thinking about having a conversation to see where he is at mentally. We are great together. I’m happy to keep this a “friends with benefits” type thing for now. I just hope I can find a healthy balance to keep him around while still channeling energy toward potential relationships. He is SO great, so it would take someone equally as great, but mono, for me to end what I have with him. And hopefully then we can maintain a friendship of some kind!"
polyfamilies,eqsg3n0,t1_eqsg2e6,1560284106.0,"You’re correct and I realize that. I mentioned this a few times in my post, even."
polyfamilies,eqsd6lp,t1_eqsd3wx,1560282202.0,"I don’t see a need to end what we have, though. I’m not seeing anyone else."
