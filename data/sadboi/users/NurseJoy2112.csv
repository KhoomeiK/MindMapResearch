Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus usually starts at childhood and is when the body cannot make insulin on its own so the person NEEDS supplement insulin given subcutaneously. 
Type 2 DM is usually adult onset, occurs gradually, and the body can make insulin but the body is less receptive to it (insulin resistance). The person can take insulin as a treatment, but there are also oral medications to take (diet and exercise is always the first thing the health care team will tell the prediabetic to do however).  There are also insulins that are considered fast or slow acting."
