-don’t be afraid to switch therapists. If you don’t vibe, that’s totally ok. there’s nothing wrong with you! Some people just don’t mesh. Don’t be discouraged! 

-don’t be shy to say “can we put a pin in this topic” if you conversation leads into territory you’re not ready to discuss yet. Trauma is hard, life is hard, expressing yourself is hard. Take your time. This is about you and your healing. 

-if you don’t have the best memory, take notes. Sometimes my therapist says things and I say wait!! I’m writing this down lol she doesn’t mind. A good therapist wants you to heal. 

-this might sound obvious, but be super honest with your therapist. Omg this part is still hard for me. Sometimes I hate having to tell her things I did or said, because I feel ashamed. But if I don’t tell her what really happened, she can’t help me to fix anything. Then patterns repeat. It’s hard but worth it. 

Please be proud of yourself. I hope therapy is a good wave for you ✨"

Please don’t feel stupid for being scammed. It happens. It’s ok to be a little impulsive. 

You sound like a wonderful person. Making friends is really hard, so don’t beat yourself up. I’m 31 and I only have 3 friends. 2 of them live 3,000 miles away. I don’t know how long you have been on Reddit, but you should try to make friends on here. 

Actually, you don’t have to try! It’ll happen naturally. Follow different subs. Reply to people. Convos get going, and connections are made. Sometimes it doesn’t go far and sometimes it does. I know for me, having anyone to talk to some nights kept me alive. 

I made a friend who lives about an hour from me. He is very nice and I met him on this sub Reddit. I’m really grateful to have him in my life because he understands how hard being depressed is. He teaches me a lot about life just by being himself. He opens my mind up. We come from different sides of the world but we totally understand each other. It’s platonic and that’s great because I would not want to lose his friendship. 

A lot of people on Reddit play Computer and video games and make a lot of friends this way. I don’t game myself, but a lot of people are willing to connect those ways. Even if you can only speak to them through Phone or games they can still be your friend. It’s nice to have someone to talk to. And maybe one day you will meet. 

I can’t explain why I was drawn to your post but I just want to hug you. Life is fucking hard but you’re doing your best. You might think you’re awkward, I am too. But that’s ok. Being awkward isn’t a bad thing. Plenty of awkward people want awkward friends.

How dare you tell me or anyone with depression that changing their attitude will change everything. Are there no scientist on your planet?

I also love how you said that you’re happy you began the LOA after your awakening and self love, because you would have manifested something based on your self worth then, which is less than what you deserve.

depression,fqpappr,t3_gk359c,1589540925.0," this post is dangerous. 

You turned mental illness into the haves and the have nots. Those who  mentally pick themselves up  and those who are too lazy or weak. Would you say the same to someone with cancer? Because both are sick. 

This is a subreddit full of extremely sad and often suicidal people. You’ve come into their/our  safe space and implied to extremely vulnerable people that depression is a state of mind. It is absolutely not. It’s a chemical imbalance. Trauma can also seriously make matters worse, or be the beginning of a new battle. 

So many people write about how awful they feel because they can’t snap out of it. They’re told to stop being dramatic, or to toughen up. They’re very often told to think positive! It’s offensive because it sounds like you’re accusing that person of wanting to be miserable. 

My point is not to change your opinions because I can’t be bothered. My point is that you came into a room full of people who already feel crazy, and validated that by telling them their depression is a state of mind. 

There a lot more productive and compassionate ways to encourage people with mental illness to try harder. You can notes from the small victories people post about on this page. Taking showers, brushing your teeth, not crying for a day. Things like that are actually victories when you are deeply depressed. 

This post also gives more life to the stigmas surrounding mental illness. What’s wrong with being on meds?  Nothing. Absolutely nothing. What’s wrong with psychiatrist and therapist? Nada. Again- people in this subreddit are often extremely sad and suicidal. They need to talk to someone. They need help beyond what they can do for themselves currently and that is perfectly perfect. 

Becoming mentally & emotionally balanced is a life long job for people with serious mental health issues and trauma. Some people go years trying to get by on positive thoughts and just can’t. They need something more. They owe it to themselves to try all methods of management without judgement & categories. and as it’s a health issue, going to see medical professionals is rational. 

Again- I don’t care to change your opinion. I didn’t even want to write this because I hate long ass back and forth messages. But as someone who has been dealing with this for 26 years I could not be passive. People in here are fucking hurting. 

If you think you need help, get help. If that doesn’t help keep going and going. Let’s try any way we can think of. You’re worth it. You deserve to see how life can be when you’re stable. Don’t be ashamed of taking meds, you’re keeping yourself well. * what we need to hear *"

depression,fq55guh,t3_ggwa1b,1589093137.0,"I think to help improve the relationship with your twin, you will have to work on your own anger and patience. Try to teach yourself to breathe and give it 10 seconds before you react. Or something that works for you. I think that time gives you the space to consider other ways to communicate and it will help give you time to consider the other persons feelings.

Being approachable and a bit softer than usual is going to be the only way your twin will continuously feel comfortable talking to you about their suicidal thoughts. And while you don’t have the answers (none of us do) it’s going to help them sooo much to know they can vent to someone. And I think you should want to have that line of communication open so that if your twin ever wants to act on their suicidal feelings, they’ll come to you before trying anything.

I’m giving this advice as someone who’s been suicidal her entire life. My family and friends I’ve had in the past have really made me shut down at times. It made me not tell anyone shit, because I felt mocked or i felt like they are so harsh with me, why would they care that I want to die? I’ve tried to take my life more than a few times, and I’d def be dead had my best friend not known how suicidal I was, and had come to check on me.

I think it’s keeping me more positive than I am naturally lol"
CRPS,fp09ff1,t1_foewg45,1588204970.0,"Hey there! It’s always great to see a reply from you 💜Sometimes I have to disconnect from social media. I get...jealous I think...of my people without pain. It’s terrible! But sometimes I think I just need to feel like I’m normal! lol 

I’m very stir crazy in this house too! But I’m also feeling less guilt about being unproductive in the outside world lol I bought an air purifier and it helped so much with my breathing! I mentioned to another redditor that I tried yoga on Sunday. It was my first workout since my diagnosis! I got through 20 minutes and I could do most things except for balancing on each leg of course. After I was very wobbly and fell but I want to try again soon. I hope you have some low pain days too! I’m attached to my heating pads sending you hugs 🤗"

CRPS,fp08opc,t1_fozriij,1588204565.0,I’m happy to hear that your pain has been managed that much for you! This illness is fucking awful. Do you mind if you ask what injections you had? I would love to try ketamine but my insurance doesn’t cover it. I tried yoga on Sunday and it was a challenge but I made it through a 20 minute video! I was totally off after and fell though 😔. Baby steps is what I keep trying to tell myself. I never thought I’d missing the doctors office lol
Psychic,forucqs,t1_foqd9d0,1588018661.0,Thank you 💜💜💜
CRPS,fn1pzwa,t1_fn1g1km,1586567436.0,"It totally makes sense that it would freak you out, that’s not right! I’m sorry that’s been your experience. If it makes you feel better, I’m 31 and even before CRPS I never had anything real or long term. It’s rough out here! But I hope that you find a life partner that understands you, shows you compassion, love, empathy and joy💜"
