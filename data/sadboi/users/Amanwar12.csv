depression,fo9q6fq,t3_g6i0wk,1587627342.0,"I’ve felt that last bit about falling for someone that would probably never fall for you.

I’m much younger than you so I don’t have the life experience that you do. But the one thing I could really relate to was that part. 

It’s hard, I know. Just how you two were good friends and how in those moments while you two talked were euphoric. How you wished it would last for a little bit longer. I know it all too much. 

Then comes the hard part of having to be brought to the cold hard fact of them not loving you. Your happy times ending. 

But y’know what you need to do? You need to let it go, let him go. He’ll never love you, I’m sorry but there’s no beating around the bush with that. But this doesn’t mean you won’t find anyone. You will. Sooner or later it’ll happen, trust me.

I’m truly sorry that you have to go through all of this. It’s horrible, I know."

Damnthatsinteresting,fluhz0y,t1_flugzso,1585502973.0,"So is mine. I know many who have went to the schools...

Maybe it’s because of different ways of being brought up? My father and many he knew didn’t have any goals in life and were born to poor families in rural villages. He went due to his family pushing him to do so that he could learn about Sikhism and become a Ragi to earn an actual income. He ended up becoming a traveling Ragi and meeting many who were like him.

Now that we’ve moved to America, he’s a Granthi at our Gurdwara. No longer traveling. (Though sometimes if someone he knows needs a Ragi and will pay, he’ll travel)"
Damnthatsinteresting,flugbin,t1_fludpoq,1585502030.0,"Most times they are Ragi’s and Granthi’s. Not all Sikhs can play Kirtan nor do Ardās. That is why more often than not a Granthi does it. Though a member of the Sangaat can play Kirtan if they volunteer to do so. And technically yes, priests are not a thing in Sikhism but to be understood better, Granthi’s and Ragi’s are referred as priests. 

Most baptized Sikhs are traveling Ragi’s and Granthi’s that have went to religious boarding schools at a young age in India and devoted their lives to Sikhism. “Just a religious Sikh person” would be a bit of an understatement."

We do not view it that way. Not cutting hair is our commitment to God. Combing and taking care of it is us taking care of Gods gift. The turban is our identity and our hair is the foundation of that identity. 

Nails do not have such a high place in Sikhism and generally are actually to be kept very short in many religious Sikh schools across India. Not much is said about nails in the Guru Granth Sahib Ji. 

I hope that is a good enough answer."
