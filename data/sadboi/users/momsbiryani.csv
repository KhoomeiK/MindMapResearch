greysanatomy,fr5kmkk,t1_fr4e99e,1589910111.0,"It's honestly surprising how many people on this sub don't know that and blame stuff like Alex's exit storyline on her, she didn't write it!"
greysanatomy,fr5kax7,t1_fr4gvql,1589909960.0,"I would remind you that just having a character there doesn't really count, it's just representation for representation's sake then. But you're right the main problem is that the show has become solely a romcom at this point and it's damaging characters across the board."
greysanatomy,fr5j9tj,t1_fr4j28y,1589909469.0,Lmao they did so little with Parker that I forgot to include him in my list!!

greysanatomy,fr4090v,t3_gmji4a,1589871497.0,"There are a lot of episodes where people refer to Mer as a ""hot blonde"" or ""blondie"" but she never seems to really have blonde hair? This isn't the most enlightening discussion topic but I feel like the dialogue paints her in a certain way when she doesn't really have that hair. There's a specific episode, I can't remember which one, where a patient asks if Dr. Shepherd is looking at the blonde doctor a certain way and she definitely doesn't look blonde in that episode and it really bothers me."

greysanatomy,fqx0uon,t3_glbbnr,1589723063.0,"You know what, unpopular opinion maybe but I agree with you so much. And she definitely does it to Ben too where in later seasons they are so out of sync with each other and make big decisions without a single word to the other. I can't believe she literally just decides to call pause in their marriage for no real reason and he just has to go along with it. Ben and Bailey work because Ben is the same as her, not because their relationship is somehow healthier."

greysanatomy,fqkaui1,t3_giyrkq,1589423520.0,"Watching this show is honestly like watching our trainwreck president at this point. It's stupid storylines over and over like how many pregnancy scandals can there be? The Mer and DeLuca thing was just so disappointing, she very clearly does not match him and there's ZERO chemistry in a relationship with the MAIN character. It makes no sense at all. But they really just threw the whole show in the trash by ignoring YEARS of Alex's character development, he was one of the best storylines they had so far."

FallOutBoy,fpje4jl,t3_gdsa4c,1588665188.0,This isn't real? And why would you call him the emo kanye they're both pretty different. Kanye is a clusterfuck of crazy (and I say that as a bipolar person myself). Them having the same disorder doesn't make them that similar.

I think it depends a lot on your situation tho. In Comm Studies, we have an amazing, well-organized, passionate department. Our professors love what they teach and know how to connect to their students. Our classes are both academic and practical in nature. I also love LB because the area is great, so close to the beach I usually go once a week during spring semester. We have a lot of awesome resources and certain clubs are very dedicated and worth the time to attend meetings. The people here are friendly and sometimes you can have a really great conversation with a complete stranger. I really miss being on campus :("
TaylorSwift,foph8qm,t3_g8r2g4,1587961435.0,"I think some of these titles are more lyrics not the actual song title, a little too cumbersome

Her longer title names are still light and say something concrete about the song and are catchy when sung (Look What You Made Me Do, Miss Americana and the Heartbreak Prince)

Otherwise I like the idea behind the album and the title Honey"

bipolar,foi40e8,t3_g7a2xp,1587778254.0,I think this could very simply be solved by having a day dedicated to art posts. That way it isnt so constant (I enjoy the art but theres seriously way too much of it for a sub that isn't actually about art) but people can still post it. Also....bring memes back! They really made my day better.

TaylorSwift,focxvft,t3_g6tew6,1587677322.0,I get the point but when she says they realize paying $330 million was a mistake isn't she kind of saying that her music isn't worth much?

I still think it's more about Calvin than Joe just because of the overarching storyline. It speaks more to the character she built up for Calvin in her songs about him. I think there's also a possibility that it's not about just one of them, she may mix content she has written about both into one song where it all fits together (which would explain why the point analysis comes out so close too)"
