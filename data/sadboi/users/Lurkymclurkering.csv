Stress on 'had'.

I never forgot a damned thing. I memorized everything, high intelligence, people would come to me to ask me random stuff...

...and now I sometimes forget how to wash my hands.

Like you, my seizures have messed my brain up something serious. I know you're only 20. I had entire career built around my intelligence. I was making extremely good money. Today, I'm considered disabled.

It's really weird. Most hilarious and ironic thing about it, is I'm fine with it. There's zero point in getting angry about it because it won't change a thing.

But I can cope. I still live alone most of the time. I have reminders on my phone for important stuff, a calendar to write things down in (with reminders - I refer to it every day) and manage my life that way.

My boyfriend is amazing and my rock. We're separated right now due to Covid, but he texts me every morning to make sure I'm alright and to remind me to take my meds (despite the reminder on my phone - he does it anyway). 

Here's what I recommend to you, assuming you're on board with your doc & neuro: Give yourself permission to screw up, because it really is okay. So what if you forgot the alarm went off? Don't sweat it. Make changes, if you need to: Set secondary alarms. Leave your phone across the room so you can't shut it off then go back to sleep or forget. Leave yourself notes. Use lists. Use a daytimer (I find paper is WAY better than a phone - phones are too easy to dismiss). Make sure you only have 1 bank account. Don't work a hugely stressful job (makes it far worse). Use one of those old people pill separators if you have to (I do, after, despite numerous reminders, I forgot to take a dose. Took me nearly 3 days to recover) that separate by the day. 

Pretty much make a deal with yourself: Whatever it takes. YOU are what's important. I used to be the person that people went to for help & advice & information. I stopped. I ditched the fake friends & fake family so that I was surrounded by people who genuinely care. I stopped with confusing things and made my life simpler. Sold my big house and moved to a teensy apartment - easier to manage. Sold my vehicle (can't drive anyway - too many seizures and it's gonna be a hella long time before I get six months seizure free). 

I simplified. I had to. Whatever it takes. Whatever it takes to make sure I'm being looked after for once instead of me looking after everyone else. It's not selfish, it's self-preservation. It's survival mode time.

So make sure you're taking care of you, the best you possibly can. I know the memory thing is difficult, but you can work around it."

She said 'in her day' (she's almost 80, let her have it) that they didn't have support. She would have been mortified to go to her mother or my dad's mom and ask them to babysit. It simply wasn't done. You were parents. Your kids were yours and yours to raise.

She never would, in a million years, expect to foist her kids off on a friend for a night. It simply wasn't done. Were there days when she wished she didn't have 3 kids at home (I came along later and was raised alone)? You bet. But they had kids. That's what you did. 

Daycares didn't exist. All of the kids were expected to do chores from the time they were little. Even as young as 3 - they could help set the table (poorly, but it's a lesson), fold towels, and help put their clothes and toys away.

On mom's facebook, she has family. She loves it. It's a great way for her to keep in touch with her nieces and nephews, grandkids, great grandkids, etc. It makes her day. 

....except her one granddaughter-in-law. This is my oldest brother's middle son's wife. They have two boys, ages 4 & 1. She complains on her FB daily about when daycare will open again, how stupid it is that her mom can't fly out to help her in this 'time of trouble', etc, etc. 

My mom is horrified, so I showed her how to mute someone on FB for 30 days. 

Just a perspective from the older generation: Having kids doesn't give you a license to entitlement. Raise your kids. Be their parents,

canada,fqny8nn,t1_fqnxxli,1589503776.0,"Ironically, I had a flight booked for mid-March. Because I got sick, I cancelled, got a refund and booked him to come here. That one we cancelled the second Covid showed up in China. We had good instincts and as much as we both wish he were here, we’re glad we cancelled early and didn’t get dragged into the cancellation shitshow that so many did. 

In hindsight, had we known how ill I’d get (though improving!), it would have been awesome to have him here anyway, but who knows what virus he would have dragged here with him."
bipolar,fqnxyfr,t3_gjxqzq,1589503616.0,"Mood swings are NOT bipolar disorder. Someone going into a laughing fit then dissolving in to years also doesn’t mean bipolar.

People are allowed to express emotions and various habits without it being a brain problem.

Also: the media has done a shit job or portraying bipolar people: apparently, we go on tangents killing people in blood rages then get depressed and commit suicide and can’t hold down a job."

I no longer turn to booze and drugs to cope. I dealt with some of the issues that were triggers.

I can’t cure bipolar: that’s a chemical process in my brain that doesn’t work, but I can ensure I’m coping better.

I have episodes, oh hell yes. But they’re fewer and farther between and I recover faster - I know how to ‘make it better’."

Where I live (I’m the Albertan), they’re talking about opening up the mall next week. It’s across the street from me. No way in hell can you pay me to go in there. I mean, we don’t even have a vaccine and countries that are reopening are seeing surges in numbers.

Hard pass."

Keep the borders closed. We’re not selfish enough to put others at risk.

It sucks, huge. During Covid, I’ve been diagnosed with a long term illness and lost my job, and he badly wants to be here. We even contemplated trying to hike across the border before realizing how stupid that is.

Even though this affects me sorely - keep the borders closed. It’s too soon."

Mercifully, my best friend is still my best friend and been a rock. 

And actually, the money and working wasn’t the hard part to give up. My independence has been. I’m super tired 24/7, taking meds for the first time in my life, can’t drive and often too tired to walk anywhere. It’s crazy.

That’s a shit reason to have kids and an unrealistic expectation to have. Not everyone is a carer or nurturer, so you might end up doing something you don’t wanna do on a crapshoot.

Russian roulette with kids, essentially."

PersonalFinanceCanada,fqnm4ty,t3_gjpvby,1589497327.0,"Scotiabank, the ever-hating assholes that they are, nailed me $90 in two separate NSF charges on the same day. I had thought that I changed/cancelled any reoccuring payments going through BNS. Apparently, even though I did change it with them, Paypal decided to take their sweet time making that change. Forward to two weeks later: They put through two charges (iTunes purchases of a whopping $1.99 each). I had about $1.69 in that account at the time, but close to $8,000 in my savings. Does BNS move the whole $4 over to cover? Nope. $90 in NSF fees. 

When I phoned them, I was pretty much told to pound sand and that I should watch my accounts better. 

True. I should also bank with a better bank. So I pulled everything. If your rhetoric is that your customer isn't worth 2 seconds of your time for $4, c'ya. 

On a side note: I am a banker. I work for a smaller bank (chartered, and not a credit union, just not a big bank). Guess what report I get every morning before the doors even open? An NSF report. This report is of every single one of my clients. All of them. That report shows me who is in danger of having something returned on them that day. So what do I do? I phone or email them and ask if they can cover. If I can't reach them, I take the time to look at their account. Not a big amount going out and they're getting paid in a day or so? I let it go. There's a $5 charge for that. Can they cover it by 11 or so? Great. Nothing happens. The sun will rise tomorrow.

They're given a chance. Because they're humans and clients and I want their business. That's what customer service is.

So I gotta say I'm glad to see a big bank getting on the bandwagon that some of the little guys do: customer service."
