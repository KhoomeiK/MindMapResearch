relationship_advice,fqxkswv,t3_gligd4,1589733841.0,I‚Äôd say he doesn‚Äôt necessarily want to do that to someone as quite often people watch porn but have no intention of going out and doing what they saw. But I would be concerned if he is spending $100 a month on it. It‚Äôs sounding like it‚Äôs becoming a bit obsessive? And the more porn you watch the more numb you become to be turned on by normal things so he‚Äôs probably paying to see more hardcore stuff because he‚Äôs becoming less aroused by normal stuff. Next issue is he left it in plain sight on the laptop/computer so your kids could have stumbled across it. So I would speak to him about his reasons for spending so much on it and your concerns that it‚Äôs being left for anyone to see.
