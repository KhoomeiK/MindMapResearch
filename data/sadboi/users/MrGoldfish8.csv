No it's fucking not. It's the advocacy for the elimination of hierarchical structures.

>Even the purest anarchist will not refuse absolute power. 

We wouldn't even give ourselves the opportunity. Anarchist methods of revolution are almost entirely based on dual power structures, primarily non-hierarchical trade unions (anarcho-syndicalism) and non-hierarchical community assemblies (libertarian municipalism). Insurrectionary anarchism is also a thing but it's a minority, with most being syndicalists.

>Everyone acts in self interest, nobody is excluded

I *would* ask you for evidence but there's no point, because that claim has no basis in reality.

>Anybody who does not have the support of the people and has adequate means will resort to more unholy actions to maintain power.

That's why our revolutionary methods are all based on popular power. We need at least the majority of people to support anarchist or libertarian socialist causes (knowingly or not) to have a successful revolution."
