I know exactly how you feel. I've been having severe panic attacks for 4 years now and I've always been told that I'm just overreacting or being overly dramatic. this while I'm struggling to breath, physically hold myself together and not hurt myself in a state of blur.
to list a few things, I've lost my childhood best friend to bad anesthesia and been molested several times. so I think I'm allowed to have a panic attack or two in bad situations. no one needs to hear crap from other people that have no idea what the other person is going through. everything you feel is valid. 
a big fat hug to you :')"
