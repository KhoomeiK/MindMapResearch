But, 
I rember some guy on Shelter's youtube comment section writing about how she had to wait there until someone will find her (perhaps some alien), so when I listened to Sad Machine and I heard ""who survived, somebody knew? Anyone else but you?"", ""And though I know, since you've awakened her again, she depends on you"" and again the lyrics on the screen I posted, the thought about shelter being a prequel to SM came into my mind almost immediately.
Like if Sad Machine is about the finding of Rin by some alien species assisted by a robot or something on the likes of that."
