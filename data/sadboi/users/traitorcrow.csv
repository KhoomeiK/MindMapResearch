Vent,fp2gs99,t3_gao1kq,1588261495.0,"Hey, when I lived in my abusive situation I had to call CPS on more than one occasion. I don't know if the other folks here have dealt with CPS before or if in my particular case the agents were just unprofessional, but in my experience, they aren't just going to immediately take you away. It's a process, and if you want the help, it sounds like you'll have to be a bit sneaky with it. 

In my case, after 3 visits from CPS and my parents knowing beforehand about every one, nothing had happened. They cleaned the house, stocked the fridge, threatened us, and for a brief time made us look functional to the worker. I talked to my at-the-time guidance counselor about this, and she agreed to call one last time, this time informing them that the parents were preparing for the visit and being untruthful. 

If you have someone at school, or even another adult you can speak to about this, you should. This is unacceptable behavior and I know it's difficult to realize that in your situation, but beyond the parental grooming, this has to stop. I understand where you're coming from with the feeling of guilt, trust me I've felt it too, I comforted my mother plenty of times when in reality I should have let her cry and ran. 

You can get out of this situation, and you don't have to die to do it. It'll be hard, but you just have to keep reminding yourself that it's necessary and that, in the end, you really aren't betraying anyone at all. If you have to use this post's replies as that reminder, it's as good as any."

I'd make sure I'm not confusing that with an obese person saying you dont have to be ashamed of your body, though; that's very different, as just because someone is overweight doesnt mean they cant talk about body positivity. 

I also just wanted to add in that what you said about being overweight being more dangerous than being underweight isnt true. Being underweight with a BMI lesser than 18.5 is almost two times as dangerous than being overweight, and this isnt to say that being overweight is healthy in the slightest, but I dont want others to think that going down that underweight road is healthy at all. As someone with anorexia, it's quite alarming to constantly hear praise for people who are obviously underweight just because they ""look good"". 

Its about being healthy. Some people who are overweight a bit can be perfectly healthy and as you said, that's not your problem. It's only a major risk for everyone to have folks telling them directly to become obese, as well as it is to have folks telling them it's okay to be underweight."
