So I bought a house in my 20s (about 25 years ago).  I've NEVER missed a payment in my life.  We almost had the thing paid off (down to like $5000 left on the mortgage).  We decided to buy a bigger house in the 'burbs last fall.  So, we sold the old house, plowed almost all of the equity into the new one.  Credit score dropped 40 points!!  From over 800 to like 760.  When I checked into what the heck was going on, the only contributing factor is ""length of credit.""  Since we don't really have a credit card (do everything with a debit card), the only loan we had was the mortgage, and since we got a *new* mortgage, the credit bureaus think our credit history only goes back a few months.  WTF?  So if you pay off a mortgage, the entire history of that loan just disappears?  I mean, our new loan is even with THE SAME MORTGAGE COMPANY.  So there's literally nothing changing here except an account number, and my credit score drops 40 points?!"

* Base Board With USA Based Parts, and all optional parts:  $95
* Base Board With USA Based Parts, no optional parts: $70
* Base Board With ""cheapest"" parts, and all optional parts: $62
* Base Board With ""cheapest"" parts, no optional parts: $46

The optional parts for the base board are: power adapter, toggle switch, and power LED.

* Floppy Emulator with USA based parts: $124
* Floppy Emulator with ""cheapest"" parts: $107

* Game/Sound/Joystick with USA based parts: $87
* Game/Sound/Joystick with ""cheapest"" parts: $55


So, if you go with all three boards, and you go ""with the works"", you're talking $306.  If you instead want to go cheapest possible, fewest optional components, you're talking $208.  

If you want to just get started, and want to go cheapest route, it's $46 (base board with no options).

If you just want the printed circuit boards and want to source everything else yourself (I can provide bills of material), the PCBs are $8.50 each (you can probably get most of the parts from Aliexpress for all three boards for about $110, so if you're handy with a soldering iron, the cheapest way to get everything is probably that route -- you'd spend about $150 for everything, but you have to deal with dicey suppliers, soldering fumes, and hardware debugging of your soldering skills of course :-).

All chips are socketed (at no charge), to allow them to be replaced if there are any problems.  Also, no surface mount chips are used.  The boards are designed to be repaired if necessary... like in the old days when we didn't just throw electronics away.  :-)

So, **PM me with what you'd like to do.**

*P.S. I'd probably be remiss if I didn't mention Matthew Hagerty's F18A replacement for the TMS9918 video chip in the graphics board.  He's out of stock right now, but when they come back in stock, you would have the option of changing the video chip in the graphics board, and you would (in theory anyway, I haven't tried it) have the option of having an HDMI / VGA video out for about $85.

There is *scant* little that you can say is universal about Anglicans: the Book of Common Prayer and associated liturgy, and that's about it.  Even the founding confession (39 Articles) isn't really treated as binding much any more.  Anglicanism is about community breadth, and not so much about community depth.  No one will get upset with you if *you* choose to go deep, but if you try to argue that others need to, you'll be met with some resistance.  This culture is the end result of the Elizabethan settlement -- the ""via media.""  Which is captured in the famous Elizabethan quote: ""I have no desire to make windows into men's souls.""  That is very much part of the culture of the Anglican communion.

So, the burden is more on you to figure out how to live the faith than in other denominations.  To some extent, perhaps the Methodists are similar in this regard (and they are, after all, displaced Anglicans), but in Anglicanism, your faith and your family's faith are more in your hands.  You'll find helpers in the form of the clergy, and you may find like minded parishioners to form small groups with, but you most likely won't find some fire-brand pastor who directs and drives your spiritual life.  This seems to be how congregational churches almost subliminally judge their success -- have they found a fire-brand who ""makes them feel something?""  That's not Anglicanism."

Catholicism,fp13ll0,t3_gae3wh,1588223467.0,">Obviously Protestants claim the church was started in 300 AD by Constantine to appeal to the pagans but it’s not true

This is *not* what they say.  Protestants are not ignorant of history (well, at least not all of them), they simply process it differently.  In fact, many Protestants believe that their practices more closely represent the early church's behavior than the Catholic church (a belief they come to by attempting to implement the book of Acts *literally* in their own communities in some cases).

The main contention points are basically ""How should I evaluate truth?"" and ""Who is the pope to me?""  They answer these questions differently than Catholics.  They believe that it's best to evaluate truth by private interpretation of Scripture (or some nuanced clerical/private mixture that's closer to private than clerical), and without regard to traditions or the magisterium's opinions.  Catholics do not see the world this way.  Since Protestants believe in private interpretation of Scripture, they are led to reject complex church hierarchies, because they do not see these hierarchies in the New Testament.  Since they reject complex church hierarchies, they reject the college of cardinals and the pope (or rather, they see them as no more important than their own bishops/elders).  Most of them recognize three religious roles: deacons, priests (that they often call pastors), and elders/bishops.  They argue this way because they point to Scripture and say ""these three roles are all there is, why would we do anything more?""  The Catholic counterargument is that Scripture emerged out of a tradition itself, and thus some forms of tradition are important and should guide us.  A complex hierarchy helps maintain order, and yes it is an emergent tradition whose *basis* is found in Scripture.  Problem is, Protestants won't agree to that.  The reason they're *called* Protestants is because their predecessors were *protesting* what they viewed to be traditions that were not connected to Scripture (the sale of indulgences is their favorite blunt object, generally).

So, unless you can convince a Protestant that their private interpretation is not as healthy as guided understanding led by the magisterium, they will always assert that they prefer to remain outside of the Catholic Church.  This of course is where scandal amongst the clergy *really* works against conversion.

>Too many people ignore that and like to think that just believing God will save you is enough when it’s told that we will be judged according to our faith and works.

There are some more extreme forms of Protestantism where this accusation could be leveled, but you must know that not all Protestants eschew the Eucharist.  Again, this gets back to ""How should I evaluate truth?""  Since they've answered that with ""sola Scriptura,"" and private interpretation, they practice the Eucharist solely because Jesus instructed them to, and they do not view it as something necessary for salvation.  But how do they get around John 6 you ask?  Well, these folks (at least the scholarly ones) aren't Biblically ignorant.  Their argument is that John 6 is but one of several situations in John where Jesus is speaking figuratively of himself:  ""I am the door,"" ""I am the true vine,"" ""I am the light of the world,"" and of course ""I am the bread of life"" in John 6.  So, they argue that because Jesus ordered us to perform the Eucharist, we do it, but that it does not confer salvation, and they instead point to more specific passages where Jesus references belief in him, or baptism in him.

I was once Protestant.  There is much misunderstanding on both sides.  If there is ever going to be any chance of real ecumenical progress, it has to start with folks acknowledging the *real* stances of their estranged brethren, otherwise we're all just talking past each other.

(◔_◔)

Jesus' life on Earth was filled with mystery.  He's the son of the living God, why would we expect anything different?  Just like all humans, he had periods of his life where his behaviors could probably have been summarized as ""nice,"" and other periods where he would be more accurately summarized as ""demanding.""  No one in their right mind thinks otherwise... they're just emphasizing one period over the other to accomplish some objective.  We often get ourselves in trouble when we try to put God in a box like that (and there are *many* boxes, not just this one).  Any time someone says ""Jesus is like ____ "" or ""Jesus is *not* like _____ "" your spiritual ears should perk up.  Someone is about to put Jesus in a box.  A healthier rendering would be something more like ""In this situation, Jesus seems to be like _______.""

Because we're talking about the son of the living God, his life on Earth is really just hard to ""sum up"" in a way that doesn't leave out hugely important areas and themes.  Even the idea that Jesus wasn't obsequious could be challenged.  99.9% of his life on Earth this would be true.  He understood the definition of keeping oneself holy and separated from evil.  He told others to go and sin no more, absolutely.  Yet, in Gethsemane, even though he prayed to have the cup taken away, he was *obedient* to God's will, to the point that he *unjustly* took on all the evil of the crucification for all people throughout all time.  So in that instance, he didn't remain separate from evil (praise be).  He took upon himself all the evil and all the sin that had ever been committed and would ever be committed.  We can never forget that he was our perfect sacrificial lamb.  

And... I think lambs are generally pretty ""nice,"" table flipping and righteous indignation notwithstanding.  Taken from that perspective, perhaps, Jesus was the *nicest* being that ever lived."

So, here's why people call him a fascist.

1) He is *clearly* [a dictator wannabe / strongman.](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-trump-claims-president-authority-is-total-2020-4)  Fascist countries always have demigod / demagogic leaders (Hitler, Mussolini, Franco, Vargas, Metaxas, Stojadinović, etc.)

2) He values nationalism and the state over the individual, and has demonstrated this in numerous ways, [like this](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-take-firearms-first/), [and this](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/03/4th-july-donald-trump-military-parade-tanks-seen-washington-dc/1637384001/), [and this.](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-bring-back-nationalism-rich-lowry-book-mainstream-1470816)

3) He has a strange fascination with making things ""great again,"" which certainly echos some of Mein Kampf's ""Lebensraum"" ideas,  Hitler's obsession with ""being betrayed,"" and his obsession with ""rebirth of the fatherland.""

4) He's a [racist.](https://www.vox.com/2016/7/25/12270880/donald-trump-racist-racism-history)

5) He [likes businesses to have cozy relationships with government](https://www.npr.org/2017/08/16/543876454/in-trumps-government-the-regulated-have-become-the-regulators), just like [fascist countries.](https://www.adl.org/news/op-ed/german-businesses-and-nazis)

6) He has a [veiled hatred for democracy](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/08/donald-trump-citizens-united-anti-democracy-decade), basically [eagerly demonstrating how easy it is for money to corrupt it.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/09/trump-buying-politicians/498749/)  (Not to demonstrate a problem that needs addressed mind you, just to demonstrate how weak the government is and how powerful he is.)

7) He's a [perpetual victim with a fragile ego](https://newrepublic.com/article/156650/donald-trump-joseph-maguire-national-security-nightmare), who's [never responsible for anything](https://www.wired.com/story/covid19-trump-coronavirus-press-conference/), which [certainly sounds like Hitler and Mussolini.](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/30/trump-borrows-tricks-of-fascism-pittsburgh)

8) He [looks the other way when violence occurs that aligns with his rhetoric](https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/apr/26/context-trumps-very-fine-people-both-sides-remarks/), and [doesn't really believe in the rule of law.](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/trumps-unique-assault-rule-law/590875/)

9) He's toyed with the idea of [making his rule permanent.](https://fortune.com/2019/05/06/donald-trump-presidential-term-limit/)...  1000 Year Reich much?


Now... you can argue that he's a very *weak* fascist, or that he only has *fascist tendencies*, but acting like the word is so bizarre that no sane person could think that it applies is frankly, ridiculous.  He has a *lot* in common with fascists of the past, and given that the USA has such deep democratic roots, in order for fascism to take hold here, it would *have to* come in the form of someone like Trump -- an extremely ineffective, indolent kind of ""fuhrer"", because if he were *literally* exactly like Hitler or Mussolini, the national immune system wouldn't tolerate him.... so I don't think it's the least bit wrong to compare him to fascists of the past.  The shoe sort of fits.  He's a radical right wing populist nationalist with an obsession for ""making things great again"".  That sounds like the broad outlines of every fascist dictator who ever existed."
