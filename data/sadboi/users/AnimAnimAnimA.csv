RATS,fq763ms,t1_fq748tz,1589142275.0,"I have not seen them boxing, and also i forgot to mention that they slept in the sputnik at night together, but still sometimes i heard squeeks. Yes i know the forst rat was too young.. i just didnt know...The new one is at least 6 weeks old ,sorry i was mistaken. She is 6 weeks old, i know for a fact as she was one of my best friends accidental litter ( her new rat was pregnant when she got to her). What are the red flags that i should take into consideration? Whar could be considered bullying or just playing?"

RATS,fjn6kcu,t1_fjn5amh,1583499506.0,"After i posted this she started acting normally, ate , played with me i let her out of the cage and she acted pretty normal. For now her sister is in another cage, i got scared that it might be contagious or maybe she will bother the sick one. She is resting a bit more but otherwise seems fine. She ate a peanut, oatmeal , banana today, that s what she picked but that s what she usually enjoys most.I think i might have over reacted ( first time owning rats and i am obssesed with them) but i will keep a close eye on her and if i get worried again i found another vet  that takes rats  and is avalabile since the usual place is closed for now.  Thank you very much.Also yes , the vet i took her to yesterday is experienced with rats, in the local group of exotic animal owners they say that they are the best.. i dont know.. But at the same time owning rats is not common in my country, it s just now starting to grow on people."

RATS,fjmput7,t3_fe397d,1583478778.0, The problem is that over here there s not many vets that can treat rats. This is i think the only place that takes rats and exotic animals. I will search more and maybe go to another vet... if i can find one

selfharm,fi1z5yd,t3_f60bu4,1582067867.0,"I used to feel like this and i did get asked about my scars and yes it was awkward BUT one day i realised they were fading a bit and honestly i got a bit scared to lose them, because i realised that it was a part of me. I was clean at that time, i was not cutting anymore. But still it was a shock to think that i would stop having them. They are part of me and i gotta accept myself and my past, i mean i dont really have a choice tbh. It s ok to have those scars, you had to go through that to be who you are now. You wouldnt hide a scar if it was from an accident, right? It s the same thing."
SuicideWatch,fi1xpoq,t3_euo34a,1582066951.0,i feel like your parents feel guilty and they try to make themselves feel better by putting the blame on you to cope. And it is        not       your fault.
