Having to deal with living close to someone who's abusive is hard. I have to do it with my dad. It took me a year to convince myself he changed, but I did. The main thing I have to say is with the other commenter. I'm a minor, meaning once people at the psych ward found out and reported what had happened, cps got involved, except they werent really ""involved"". The authorities rarely have any power, especially when your experience with it is years old. I had the lady from cos sit me down and tell me ""theres no point in even investigating"""

I'm the same age as you, and when I told doctors/therapists what was going on at home they immediately reported me to CPS. CPS never followed up on the investigation until my last attempt, which was for neglect not abuse. When cps questions you, it's in front of/in hearing distance of your parents. You can request to be in completely privacy from your parents, but abusive parents tend to assume the worst. 9 times out of 10 the authority or professionals getting involved just makes it worse, and I'm sorry."

The more rich either one is, the more likely it is that the case will gain traction, especially if they're dealing with the public a lot. Another factor is age. The younger a victim, the more attention. The last one I can think of is severity of the crime. Murder or assault will get more attention then a burglary or robbery."
