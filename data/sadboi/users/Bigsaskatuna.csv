I got back to my friends house and I’m just about to dive in and the store phoned me and said they only charged me for the pop, I left without paying for the pasta. The girl on the phone was upset, like I was responsible for her only charging me for the drink and not the food. I told her I’d give her my visa number over the phone and she said no, I had to return to the store and pay before I even eat it! I offered her again to pay over the phone, she again wouldn’t hear it, so I hung up. Next day her boss emails me and said I owe him for the food. The kicker is the pasta was absolutely burnt.
