The feedback I got was to change my hair, lose weight, lay off the eyeliner among other things. So, I lost twenty pounds, though I'm not sure it shows. I changed my hair back to the real color and got bangs to hide my horrific forehead because of the deep frown line. I couldn't ditch the eyeliner because without it, I look like a zombie without it.  I tried winged eyeliner, but I have hooded eyes, and skin damage from years of getting sunburned. But, I think this is an improvement. What do you all think?"

SkincareAddiction,ewcnrki,t3_cnpfcf,1565287681.0,"My forehead has been getting worse by the year. This started when I was 30, and now I am 38. I wish that I could be a person who is not bothered by this. But, it makes me extremely insecure, and causes my social anxiety to be worse than it already is. I have tried creams and serums to no avail. I use Frownies facial patches on it, but now where I put it, the texture is horrible. So, there is a triangle of very bad texture. Even though that product barely does anything for it anymore, I still use it on days that I have to go to work. I work in customer service/retail, and my customers always stare at me. Like literally stop and stare. When I am on the register, no one wants to come to me. I don't like my coworkers to look  at it, either. So I make eye contact with no one. I wish there was a way to fix this that does not involve Botox, because I will never be able to afford it.
Is anyone else in this situation. If so, what do you do about it?"
