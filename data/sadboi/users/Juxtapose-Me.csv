ACT,ewhwhyq,t1_ewhm4bv,1565426067.0,"What I did on my essay was that I found different examples to support each point. I’m not sure if format works for all ACT essays but on mine (April 2019, College Football prompt), I used each perspective (3) as a main point to argue while having one central theme for the whole essay, I then used different rhetorical devices and connections to explain why that perspective helped strengthen my overall thesis. For instance, I commented how an issue brought up in one perspective was similar to one found in the classic literary novel, Huck Finn. I then used that to help boost my overall argument using devices like similes, irony, or ethos/pathos/logos. (I got a 12, there’s a bit of ethos for you)

If anything was unclear, just reply, I’m sorry if I was a little all over the place with this."
ACT,ewhw0cf,t1_ewhtg4w,1565425297.0,"Read anything you can and make sure you have a diverse range of materials. Read a fiction book, then a newspaper article, then an article from a science magazine. While you’re reading, make sure to try and absorb everything you read in a designated time slot (I forgot exactly how much). If you can’t, make slow progress by starting with a larger time frame and incrementally shorten it. This will help you read quicker and understand more (worked for me at least)."

trumpet,ew94cal,t1_ew8ya11,1565219448.0,"I set my metronome to 60 bpm. I like to start at middle G (G4) and go down to the lowest note (F#3) playing each note for two measures. Then I start again at the middle G and go up as high as I can without straining. Then, I start at middle G again and go down to middle C to refocus my lips. I switch up the styles on different days: I might just do plain long tones, I may do them at as quietly as possible (for control), or I might do them starting quietly must crescendoing to the end. It’s what I feel like would benefit me most that day with what I’m planning on playing that day."
