I hope this helps, even if just a little. I know it's tough, it's ok to be depressed and feel the way you do."
SuicideWatch,fncohgu,t3_g0dgke,1586842229.0,"Hey op, as someone who graduated from college(4 year university) not too long ago, I can tell you the journey was worth it. I met my best friend and we got an apartment together and lived together for 2 years after college. Then we got an apartment after college so we could keep living together. We even moved to a new city together too. I never thought this would happen to me, I thought I'd live alone after college, but now I have an amazing friend, a nice apartment, and a good job with tons of opportunities. The way I see it is this: You never know what could happen. You can assume the future will be awful, but you don't know for sure, so why not at least wait to see how things pan out? They could turn out way better than you expected. Also, I was scared of similar things that you are scared of, especially learning to drive. I didn't think I could do it, but once I did and I got my own car, it was incredibly liberating, especially as I got used to driving more. I know it's scary becoming independent, but it is amazing at the same time. I hope this helps, good luck to you."
