beermoney,evka0zk,t3_ck4quj,1564578120.0,"I had issues last month and thought it might be a glitch somewhere in the system so let it ride. 

Tried again yesterday and encountered the same issue. Frustrating to say the least and I almost decided to log out and give up on it altogether, but my inner broke-ass talked me into hanging in there so I get a bigger payout when the issue is finally resolved."

freelance,etf5djf,t3_car3yh,1562760633.0,"This happened to me last year after I had been writing content for a UK-based web developer for nearly two years, without incident. He always paid for projects, and rarely did I have to remind him, so I was foolish enough to trust him when it came to the very last project I completed before terminating our working relationship (I mean, we were FB friends for chrissake!).   
The last job was for a major website he was overhauling, requiring all new SEO content and would've netted me about $1k. I did all the writing work in small batches over a month and submitted(as agreed), made a few minor revisions as asked, and then got ghosted without pay.   
Reminder invoices were ignored, email inquiries, and other means of communication were ignored. And because he's in the UK and I'm in the US, I didn't really think it would've been worth the cost to pursue any legal action. I know he made some serious bank off that job and it still just chaps my ass to this day that I got taken like that."

So, noise and interruptions are constant. I ended up converting a backyard shed into a makeshift office. It works out quite well, and pants are still optional!"
tuckedinkitties,eqm5spm,t3_bykiku,1560156867.0,"We’re experimenting with different configurations of pool noodles for either a donut type “cone” or a tail splint. Sadly, nothing works as well so far as the cone of shame."
tuckedinkitties,eqm5mke,t1_eql86f7,1560156777.0,"I spent $35 on one of those cones from Petsmart just a day after her diagnosis, and despite all the extra velcro fixtures and the added harness-like strap, she kicked it right off with her back paws as soon as she saw her tail. :("
tuckedinkitties,eqkcwf7,t1_eqjwj1a,1560120526.0,"That,’s correct. The best article we’ve found to explain it was published by [Cornell University’ Veterinary School. ](https://www.vet.cornell.edu/departments-centers-and-institutes/cornell-feline-health-center/health-information/feline-health-topics/hyperesthesia-syndrome)"
tuckedinkitties,eqkchev,t1_eqk8jkm,1560120263.0,"We have looked at those. Unfortunately, even with her claws clipped she can still gain enough grip with her back paws/claws in the fabric to pull it off. We even tried a donut type device and she yanked that thing off so fast...it was like flushing $35 straight down the toilet."
tuckedinkitties,eqkc7ve,t1_eqkaos9,1560120085.0,Thanks for the suggestion.  Just followed!
tuckedinkitties,eqkc5xy,t1_eqkb1xv,1560120049.0,"Funnily enough, our primary vet pushed Bravecto on us as we we checking out. We’ve taken her off the drops altogether because we don’t believe she truly needs them and we also feel bad about all the new medications we’ve been subjecting her to."
tuckedinkitties,eqjtyjq,t1_eqixqeg,1560111201.0,"We have been experimenting with different types of splints but no luck so far in finding a solution that will actually stay in place. 

If you only knew how hard it is to get something to actually stay on her tail, especially when she’s having one of her episodes."
tuckedinkitties,eqjtqci,t1_eqjk10c,1560111097.0,"We would love to find a more holistic and much less intuitive solution to her problem. Unfortunately, however, it’s a neurological condition. There really is very little known about it in the world of veterinary medicine, hence our referral to NC State. 

In effect, she has a constant feeling of something akin to the pins and needles feeling you get when your arm or leg falls asleep-except more painful. Even though she has the sensation down her entire back, the tail is just the part of her body she can see as a source for the discomfort and really get after. 

Even if her tail was docked, she’d constantly be trying to get after whatever part of her body she could see and reach.  We’re still pretty early in the stages of discovering which meds work best and in what dosages, but I kind of feel like we have to feel this thing out on our own because even the Veterinary School at NC State was kind of at a loss."
tuckedinkitties,eqjsjw9,t1_eqjq9ut,1560110538.0,"I agree! We have already tried several different ideas but due to the nature of her disease, the cone is the only thing that physically prevents her from seeing her tail, which is the source of her discomfort, and attacking it. Until we find the right dose and combination of meds, the cone is all we have to keep her from hurting herself ) she had already de-gloved the tip of it at the onset of the issue). 

We’ve been looking at different types of splints involving pool noodles and self-adhering bandages,or something that would prevent her from more self-harm, but the tail is a really tough appendage to get a splint to stay on. 

We’re totally open to suggestions!"
tuckedinkitties,eqjrtwa,t1_eqjkauq,1560110201.0,"No, it’s not a stupid thought at all. In fact, it was one of the first ideas I had as well. 

The problem is that FHS is a neurological disorder that basically makes the cat feel as though something is constantly touching or poking her, and it can be quite a painful sensation for her at times. The meds help to eliminate that sensation but the cone is a barrier that physically prevents her from seeing her tail as an enemy (as it is the source of her discomfort) until we can figure out what meds are working, and in which dosages. Even with her tail docked, she’d still have the constant neurological stimulation if she’s not medicated (like how many amputees have phantom pains). 

The vet at NC State was all about leaving her in a cone for life, stating, “Many cats adapt quite well to life in a cone.” We are not of the same opinion, but in all honesty, she doesn’t seem to mind it in the least. 

We’re definitely hoping to get a handle on this thing but we also want her to have some type of quality of life so we are open to tail docking.  The vet wants to give it a couple of months but mentioned that euthanasia may end up being the kindest thing we can do if the meds don’t help to resolve the issue. Obviously, that is the very last thing we want to have to do."
tuckedinkitties,eqithjk,t1_eqis1tj,1560093354.0,"Hi there! Yes, it was a challenge to get the vet to consider our initial thoughts of this diagnosis because he was convinced that “Dr. Google” was leading us astray. He thought it was an allergic reaction to flea bites (she’s an indoor cat and still on preventive drops since we have dogs). We ultimately had to get a referral to NC State for a confirmation diagnosis. She is on the CBD oil and Amitriptoline as well as Gabapentin. We’re still in the early stages of identifying which of those meds are actually the one(s) working, but if we remove or alter any of them, or remove her cone or Thundershirt, she goes right back at her tail. It’s like she sees it as an entirely different entity rather than a part of her own body, and she HATES it with a living, breathing passion. We remove the cone and shirt for about 20 mins each day to allow her to groom, but for the most part she stays tucked and swaddled."
