There are so many friends/people I've met that I've shared meaningful moments with, and I thought we would have a solid and lasting friendship. But for whatever reasons they never last. A lot of times I feel like it's my fault because I'm not very good at communication. It's been the downfall of my relationships, too.

A lot of people I meet seem to be quite extroverted, I guess because a lot of introverts really don't get out of the house much? And it's hard to keep up with an outgoing person when that's not how you are. It's exhausting.

Are you the same way? You seem to speak from experience."

I've tried all that, my life has changed a lot many different times over the past 10 years. Most changes have been initiated by me in my attempts to create meaning for my life. I've finally settled on a career, goals and hobbies. Gotta stick with em now because I'm too poor and getting too old to keep changing things up all the time. I spent a long time sitting around moping and being depressed, but I really have been putting in effort to put that behind me.

I guess it just comes down to luck. Hopefully I'll meet someone one day where we both fit into each other's lives. Where we can rely on each other and share our life experiences.

Thanks for the advice."

You didn't really know what was going on and it took you a little while to learn it, but once it clicked you were hooked. Games didn't used to hold your damn hand all the time. AAA developers also used to come up with new ideas and IP's more often. I feel like they took more risks and tried to stand out back then. No thanks, I don't wanna play Call of Duty or Assassin's Creed 23. I don't care how good it looks, honestly I think graphics have already reached amazing levels.

Find something you don't mind doing and get good at it. Once you become irreplaceable in your line one work, you have leverage -- you won't have to put up with much bullshit because your company won't want to lose you. And if they don't care, say screw em and start working for yourself. By that point, you'll have the skills and knowledge to do so. You just gotta keep at it and put some years in.

I've wasted so much time sitting around thinking about shooting myself. I'm not gonna damn shoot myself. I would've done it by now. All this pain is because I spend so much time in my own head, feeding my worthless ego. It's pointless. It's time to get out and look beyond myself. Focus on others, develop meaningful relationships with people. Take the bad things in stride and not dwell on them, because there's no point in it. It doesn't matter.

Life,foxyafr,t3_g97fma,1588160294.0,"I don't think money itself is the problem. I think it could be a good system, as it gives people a simple, easily exchangeable incentive to work and trade. We need people to work and invent things to maintain and progress society.

So the problem is the fat cats who climbed and stepped on everyone else to get to the top, and now they and their descendents run their companies with nothing but profit in mind. People, like you and me, who feel entitled to more than everyone else. And then there are the corrupt politicians who allow it to happen. 

It's just greed, a human nature. They're the ones who force people like your mom to work ridiculous hours just to afford a vacation every now and then. Some people work like that just to afford necessities. And unfortunately, a large number of people think that's ok. There are some good jobs out there, of course, but I feel like they're outnumbered by the bad ones.

Maybe that wasn't the right thing to do. I'm managing, but I'm not any happier. My job requires hard physical labor, speed, and a ""get it done"" attitude sometimes. Which is hard on a depressed mind. It also involves dealing with people/customers and sales, which is hard when you have anxiety.

We've been friends since before his son was born, and he's always been this upbeat, optimistic, extroverted guy. But as someone who's known deep depression since I was a kid, I've noticed breaks in his character lately. I can tell he's having a hard time and could use someone to talk to -- a place I've been in many times.

Problem is, he has the ""happiness is a choice"" mentality and always changes the subject when we get on it. He says things like ""I don't sit around like a pansy and feel sorry for myself.""

I can't read his mind, but I think I know exactly what he's doing. And I know how painful it is to bottle that shit up and pretend it's not there. But all I can do is be there for him if he ever wants to talk about it.

socialskills,ffmy88p,t1_ffmx230,1580060155.0,"Well it's been a long time since I've had to, but I've held my own a couple times. I'm a pretty small guy, but I know a couple smaller guys you don't wanna mess with."
BreakUps,fed9axy,t1_fecdnwe,1579004476.0,"It went well, but in the end it just hurt and got my hopes up. We caught up and talked as if we were still together. Same inside jokes and all that. She came over after coffee and we had sex, and I accidentally told her ""I love you"" in the heat of the moment. She didn't say it back.

That pretty much told me there that I'm wasting my time, regardless of how many times she tells me she still has feelings for me."
BreakUps,fed8gtj,t1_feclmhc,1579003610.0,"Nah, we would've gotten back together by now if it was meant to be. And if she was worth it. It's not like we talked a ton the past few months, just kinda kept up with how each other was doing every few weeks or so. It wasn't a nasty breakup, we had both felt resentment growing toward each other. I just kept holding on to hope that she was still the one and it was just a bump in the road.

But I'm glad to have the rose colored glasses off so now I see who she really is. Selfish, indecisive, and immature. She can't make up her mind about anything and I'm getting too old for that shit."

depression,fcei4ag,t1_fccql6v,1577620702.0,"Thank you.

I have no one to reach out to, hence why I let it out here. All I have in the world is a couple of friends and they don't understand these kinds of feelings. They won the genetic lottery -- tall, attractive, confident, a lot of times cocky. The kind of guy I wish I was, that I try to pretend to be. But for some reason I seem to be hardwired for anxiety, low self esteem, and depression. It has ruined my life and I can't change it no matter how hard I try."
Showerthoughts,fc3n55n,t1_fc3dauy,1577393689.0,"And I don't understand at all how so many people take pride in being worked to death. Like, you know there's more to life than a job, right? I make one little comment about how an extra day off would be nice, and I get called lazy and they brag about how much they love to work or how they need more hours to pay bills etc. -- meaning they're ok with not being paid enough to live on 40 hours/week."

SuicideWatch,fb30ei4,t1_fb2z508,1576461337.0,"I feel you. It's all a damn game I think. Sometimes I wonder if anyone on this planet is truly happy, just some are better at pretending/ignoring their misery than others. It would seem easier to just shut your brain off and be a sheep, shut up and do what the majority does.

I guess our brains just aren't wired to bypass all the bullshit."

Yeah, I've been thinking the same thing about automation in factories, was already seeing it at my old job. I don't think my dad has a problem with me staying there, especially since I paid the bills when I started working after high school because he had to take care of mom and couldn't work. He just doesn't want to see me struggle."

Advice,f8e1sh8,t1_f8e11td,1574516378.0,"There is, I kept it short and to the point. My mom was very sick growing up and suffered a lot for 14 years. I didn't have a good childhood and now I have depression or whatever issues. She finally passed in 2016 which sent me into a downward spiral. I laid out of work a lot and my performance dropped because of it which led to me losing my job. I became an insufferable, alcoholic asshole which drove my girlfriend and friends away. So basically I fucked my life up because I couldn't handle things and now here I am.

My mom was a good, beautiful woman and I still miss her so much it hurts."
UPS,f8cl555,t1_f8cbewh,1574462626.0,"I appreciate it, already contacted UPS and filed a lost package claim but seems like they cancelled the investigation as soon as it was started. They never even sent a driver out to confirm the delivery location. Did they just tell me to fuck off or are they still working on it?

My claim status says ""The search for your package has been cancelled. You need to do nothing else at this time, contact UPS if you need more help. Package search cancelled. Investigation was cancelled.""

But now the status of the tracking number says ""Update. Scheduled delivery. Please check back later for scheduled delivery."" So are they gonna send me a new package or what? I'll try to call and get some clarification as soon as i can this evening. I hate doing this crap online."

I've come close a few times but couldn't pull the trigger. So I figured I might as well keep myself busy and not let things completely go to hell. It does help me not sink as low as I did when I wasn't taking care of myself."
depression,f777imk,t3_dum66r,1573446185.0,"I'd focus more on friendships and being social at school. And maintaining those relationships. I fucked up the easiest time in life to make friends and learn HOW to make friends, because I thought I didn't need anyone. Boy was I wrong.

Turns out it's the only thing that makes life worth living."
depression,f776bbz,t1_f775t1u,1573445205.0,"I didn't start experiencing what you're talking about (no energy/motivation to take care of basic hygeine/chores) until after high school. I'm doing better now at 27, but there were a few years there where all I could manage to do was the bare minimum. Work, pay bills, eat, sleep."
depression,f775t1u,t3_dumb21,1573444787.0,"I don't know when it started, but I realized something was wrong in middle school. Parents were poor, anti-social, always fought and didn't show much affection. So I grew up a distant kid and did my own thing, wasn't really interested in other people. Then my mom first got sick when I was 11 with what would eventually kill her, which made me feel deeply sad and it just kinda never went away. 

Puberty and middle school hit me hard, I got bullied and fought a lot because of my social awkwardness. That's when the suicidal thoughts began and I knew it wasn't normal. Other kids didn't lock themselves in their room cursing their own existence. But I had no one to talk to about it, no close family or friends and my dad thinks sadness is for pussies. So I just bottled it up and did the best I could to cope. Still do."

AskReddit,f5z64if,t3_dpp168,1572568201.0,"Watching my mom suffer for 13 years from sickness, MRSA, and kidney failure after being misdiagnosed and going through 3 major surgeries. And growing up not being able to do anything to ease her pain. She finally passed away 3 years ago. I still see and hear her in that hospital bed crying, begging, and struggling for breath. She wasn't ready to die, she wanted to be around to see her kids get married etc. She didn't want to leave her dogs and cats behind.

I don't remember my mom being healthy, as I was very young when she first got sick. I remember wishing I could take on some of her pain to give her some relief. I would go through 13 years of that hell myself if it would bring her back healthy.

It's made me a numb and broken person and I haven't figured out how to get over it yet."
