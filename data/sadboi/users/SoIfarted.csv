Criteria that I am looking for: 

* no GRE
* CACREP accredited
* can do internship where I live (NC), not where the college is
* affordability

I have it narrowed down to three places so far: Gardner-Webb, Walden & University of Mount Olive. I'm waiting to hear from reps. I spoke with Liberty, but you have to do two weeks of intensive study on campus in VA...I can't do that.

Does anyone have any suggestions?"
