Accutane,fr3me03,t1_fr33rzd,1589860639.0,Same. But since we are quaratine and not seeing anyone anyway I figured now would be the best time to do it.

It's gonna be worth it for us.

Parakeets,fps3o10,t1_fpqz52f,1588866923.0,Yes definitely! For the dog part I meant potty training and obedience training along with a good amount of space to run around. I definitely plan on having my little bird outside of his cage for a lot of the time :)
Parakeets,fpqwdia,t1_fpqjsx6,1588834234.0,Oh that is really good information to know about the night time thank you! I think I will plan on getting a young one from a breeder so they can be affectionate and trust me thanks again :)

Parakeets,fpqjk1q,t1_fpqic0x,1588824287.0,I am a very light sleeper and am sensitive to sounds but I've heard mixed things about the noises from parakeets. I would essentially like an animal that is somewhat affectionate and cuddly. I don't have the space or capability for a dog or cat right now so thought a parakeet would be a good option. I am hoping that if I do get a parakeet that I can train it to be more affectionate. My mom insists that a cockatiel would be better (affection wise) hmmm..thank you for your feedback :)
Parakeets,fpqiwej,t1_fpqf4cu,1588823842.0,Thank you for the advice on getting them from a breeder. I wouldn't have known where is the best place to purchase one. I would like to tame one and train it to be affectionate if possible. I feel like a bird would be a good choice since I don't have the space or time for a dog right now and my roommates are allergic to cats. Feel like a bird would be my best bet.
BehaviorAnalysis,fmpjhmw,t1_fmo6075,1586281947.0,"Yes! This is exactly what I've been starting to think as well. Maybe since I haven't made a date yet and nothing is completely official other than completing my hours is why I am not entirely motivated. There's no time contraint. Once I schedule it I think I will feel more inclined to study everyday. Also I like that you broke down studying into sections where you didn't do as well on practice exams. I've done three so far (FIT, Bill's Mock on FB, and ABA WIZARD MOCK) and I haven't been studying that way. I've just been going through the task list in the PTBABAE manual and its driving me nuts because I don't know what direction I'm going in.

BehaviorAnalysis,fhvyp4u,t1_fhuh2tr,1581903380.0,"The Cooper chapter quizzes are great I agree. The BDS modules are completely torture to me and have discouraged me more than helped me in my opinion.

My experience has been much different and harder and even punishing for my behavior in doing ABA. I'm just over worked, tired, underpaid, exhausted, bitter, and hopeless. Most agencies I go to are messy, unethical, unorganized, and chaotic. The standards keep changing and everything is a mess. I think ABA sounds great in literature and research but the field itself has too many kinks they need to work out and it's burning people out because of that. I always tell people to do something else. I hope you get passed this as well and that things move forward better for you."
BehaviorAnalysis,ff56zj6,t3_eporfb,1579582035.0,How do you know that the February 2022 date is your first available testing date? Is this based on your own personal number of hours you still need to accrue?

I have about 400 indirect hours left and have no motivation to do this anymore but I have no idea what else to do with my life and have no desire to go back to school again. I worked so hard in undergrad and graduate school that I'm just burned out from everything. My two options are to either leave the field completely and see what else I can apply my degree to or stay in the field, and do something other than Autism consulting and maybe be a BCBA who just trains staff, does FA's or things like that, maybe even work on the insurance side and be the one who reads reports and approves hours. Maybe think about those type of things? Goodluck"

BehaviorAnalysis,f2fctvn,t1_f2c3xp5,1570215284.0,"See this sounds awesome but I have no idea on how to even find positions like that besides looking online. I was in the same position as you, I started to feel the burn out about halfway through my supervision hours. I have 400 more to go and couldn't care less about finishing them, I feel like I have some learned helplessness going on now and I just don't know what to do about my sitation. I used to be so passionate and eager about changing lives and helping people and now I just want to be able to support myself and find something stable and meaningful that is all. And I don't feel any of that with being a BI anymore and if I'm already feeling this way at the entry level position then that's not a good sign. 

That's great that your job paid for your post grad certificate in evaluation. That would be ideal for me. Because on top of making shitty money as a BI, I still have so much student loan money to pay back from undergrad and graduate school. I don't know what to do. I will look into education evaluator positions here and see what I can find. Thank you so much for your feedback I really appreciate it."
BehaviorAnalysis,f2fbj1x,t1_f2dg73y,1570214576.0,"That is exactly the same thoughts that I frequently have. That ultimately I don't feel like we are making a huge difference like the research will imply. I have worked in every setting (school, clinic, and home) and see that there is only instructional control when a behaviorist is present- but when we leave the setting families, teachers, etc all reinforce the problem behavior again or never follow through with plans and so I feel like my passion, energy, and time is just wasted. There's just so much about the real ABA world that is actually very different than what graduate programs claim the job to be. May I ask what you are doing now or what you want to do moving forward?"
BehaviorAnalysis,f2bm6hi,t3_dckok6,1570128252.0,Confidence with severe bx comes along with time and repeated exposure to it. See if your BCBA can do some role play/BST approach with you about it and  practice with them so that you feel more comfortable when the real behaviors occur.
BehaviorAnalysis,f2blr4o,t1_f2ajpkt,1570128100.0,Definitely!! I have no real ties where I'm at. I don't have a partner or family of my own so I would love to go elsewhere. And I thought about that recently but I wasn't sure if the move would help or if my problems would just follow me where I go. But I like your idea and it is something I should revisit. Thank you :)

BehaviorAnalysis,f287fdf,t1_f286jba,1570054477.0,"I really love the science of ABA and working with clients, mental or behavioral health, how each day is different with different clients. I got into ABA because I loved working with children with ASD and loved the science of ABA. 
I want to leave the field because of the ever changing standards of the BACB, it's hard to find good supervisors, the amount of time and energy that is going into my supervision is draining and I still have so much to finish. I have lost all motivation and passion in what I do anymore and no longer have the desire to do this. I have fallen into a depression and am regretful of the masters degree that I chose. I struggle every month to make ends meet on my BI wage and do not find this work to be reinforcing for my behavior anymore. I want to essentially do something that is meaningful, pay decent, and where I do not have to go back to school to get more courses or certifications."

There's 2 clinics here in Southern CA that have BCBA's working and they're absolutely amazing. I shadowed the one in LA and the leading BCBA said she found out about it by contacting the SIG for TBI at ABAI. Goodluck!
BehaviorAnalysis,eyuk6a8,t1_eyuj81b,1567464351.0,The person posting above is not exactly correct. Depending on where you are located and which agencies you do not have to have a BCaBA in order to supervise. Some agencies allow you to supervise with just a master's degree and not the BCaBA credential. I personally have not met anyone who works at agencies that have the BCaBA credential.

I am in applied behavior analysis and we have similar issues in our branch of behavioral health as well. There is a huge problem that isn't talked about where a large portion of individuals have finished their masters degree or are in the process but are still at the entry level therapist position which does not pay enough at all. Many of us cannot move up because many agencies only have a 2 tier model (therapist and BCBA) but not a lot of program manager positions with higher pay for those are haven't yet gotten their certification but should not be in the entry level position anymore because of their experience and skill set. On top of this we have 1500 hours to do and the board just increased it to 2000. It's so hard to accrue half of these hours which are all indirect client related work. I too and questioning everrything about my decision and honestly wish I did something else. I have a masters degree and cannot make ends meet. I am unmotivated to do my hours, and I'm now resentful towards this field. I hope your situation turns around and you're able to make the salary you deserve. I also tell people all the time now that grad school and higher education are the biggest scams. I wish I could go back and do a trade school."

They seemed to calm down for a long time but then started getting bad again recently when I finished grad school and am now having an existential crisis about my life. The fear of death is a huge one for me and I am seeing a therapist for it. I constantly fear that something will kill me and the thought of not knowing what happens when we die is something that also keeps me up at night. But all of this is 10x worse when I am anxious and depressed. When I am stable I feel ok and I can accept it more. For me its difficult to recognize the cognitive distortions when they happen because I am so deep into my fear that I cannot think logically. When I get the panic attacks now its less about thinking I am dying and more like ""Oh, I'm having some crazy psychotic episode"""

ADHD,exaa2i6,t3_crrqti,1566102999.0,"I have the same exact problem. What helps is having people point this out the instant they notice what I am doing so I can catch myself. When I feel like I am rambling or noticing that I am talking a lot, I will begin to slow down, breathe more, and then pause so the other person can talk or if they start to change the subject then I know that I took it too far and I let them take the lead. And with not being interested in what they are saying, when I notice I am doing that, I try to remember how they are receptive to me what I babble on so I try to give them that same respect, I will focus on what they're saying, eliminate distractions, breathe, and follow up with questions or statements about what they're talking about.

GradSchool,ewx7axf,t3_cqjavb,1565847064.0,Yep. Completely normal. I felt this way too. It was a love/hate thing. I think it becomes difficult and the lines get blurred when you start the journey with just passion and love for what you do but then more demands are made and it starts to take the love out of it so you begin to hate it/resent it but then still love it. It's complicated.
BehaviorAnalysis,ew682id,t3_cmxze6,1565157482.0,"In terms of what I used for school this is what helped me the most...

\-A small paper planner that fits in your backpacks and purses, AND Google calendar, highlighters for textbooks, sticky notes for books and reminders, notecards for SAFMEDS, pens/pencils/organizer/open space in your voice memo iphone to record lectures (get permission first if you don't have it in any accomodations).

\- File cabinet (plastic ones at staples) with dividers for articles/exams/notes/classes, etc to keep at home. Depending on if your program will use SAFMEDS or not, get something to store them in (I have a shoebox with hundreds of them lmao)

\-notebook paper and white paper for printing things out/ink for printer, reliable computer, chargers for electronics. Extra clipboards for session (dollar tree)

\-Keep at least one small ABA book in your car/purse when you can so you have something to read in your downtime, like if you're getting your car washed or something. (I used Ethics by Bailey). Seriously maximize your study time. 

FLASH DRIVE/USB THING TO BACK UP LITERALLY EVERYTHING IN CASE YOUR COMPUTER DIES. (ICLOUD TOO). one girl in our cohort had her computer die...and she lost everything. 

For me, organization was key. I didn't have time to sort through everything when I needed something. It's a ton of material and information and you gotta stay on top of organizing and labeling things and backing up all your info! If there's anything else I'll let you know! Best of luck"

**You're brain is a fucking organ**. Of course there is biology involved, which means of course there will be disease and illness just like any other organ in your body. Depression is a serious and debilitating illness that many people cannot fight off. And no individual is a pussy because they're illness takes the best of them. I understand what this person was trying to say but the approach was wrong in my opinion. We should be supportive and compassionate of those recovering from depression, falling into it, and those who are currently in it."

I was on the list for 2 years because I've just always struggled with school, I'm a slow learner, and have a learning disability.

Fast forward; now I have a Master's degree and help children with disabilities and problem behaviors and my heart aches for them. The fact that as a child, I was denied opportunities because of my grades is infuriating but it sparked a damn fire in me.

And not just research or literature about it. Thank you for the link :)"
BehaviorAnalysis,euwjrkc,t1_euuz3ah,1564076037.0,"Okay, that is what I'm seeing a lot. People being recruited by others or knowing other people that got them into it. Thank you so much for your information and tips this is going to help me understand what I need to search for. I really appreciate it :)"
college,euu8ktl,t1_eutn49b,1564039662.0,I thought about something harder than greens and then instantly judged myself lol.
aww,euu3rmp,t3_chewra,1564036792.0,i tried doing this one time to a homeless dog in Bali and he tried biting me lol
BehaviorAnalysis,euu3bfn,t1_eutd25u,1564036531.0,"I am honestly blown away by how incredible this sounds. This is a mixture of everything that I have been interested in doing. I have wanted to find a position that does just FBAs, training, collaborating, and wanted to get on the mental health side for a while. I even found a TBI clinic in LA that does FBAs on the TBI patients and then trains doctors and therapists to run programs and take data. What you are describing sounds amazing and I can see why you've grown so much in that role, it sounds very analytical but amazing. Are there multiple BCBAs in your facility? And may I ask where you're located and how you found that position? This is like a dream position in ABA for me to be honest haha. I just never see anything unrelated to Autism consulting anymore. I hear about it, read the research, but never actually meet the people doing this work or see any job listings. Thank you so much for your feedback too!"
BehaviorAnalysis,euu2mmk,t1_eut6u3r,1564036161.0,"Wow, that sounds awesome. I have never even seen any opportunities for a position at a facility that large. I need to find positions like this. Thank you for your feedback! Are you in Austin by any chance?"
BehaviorAnalysis,eut6yep,t1_eut602v,1564021158.0,"Ok so you work in facilities, but it sounds different than a typical autism aba clinic? Is the residential and day program located in the same facility? This is interesting and I feel like I would like this setting much more than in-home services. Where are you located?"
BehaviorAnalysis,eut6q0y,t1_eut3xg8,1564021018.0,Is it residential? And do you train others to implement programs? Where are you located?
BehaviorAnalysis,eut0fd7,t1_eusxd3n,1564017267.0,"Oh man, yeah. I was feeling that way when I was in my master's program too and thought the feeling would fade away but unfortunately for me it didn't. Thank you so much for the kind offer, I hope things turn out the way you want as well!"
depression,eunvw4q,t1_eti29s4,1563934213.0,Thank you kind stranger. You are very sweet.
depression,eunvona,t1_etj1962,1563934141.0,This what so kind and thoughtful of you. I like your honest and straight forward feedback. It's so upsetting feeling like you dedicated so many years and energy and now debt money into something you now can't tolerate. But you make a good point- just do something else. I just want to be able to support myself a make a living. I would have been able to do that if I stayed in my field but that doesn't make me happy anymore. So torn. thank you so much.
BehaviorAnalysis,eucsdpi,t3_cfppum,1563685048.0,"I have SR+ in small cursive script on my hip. One of my supervisors has the 4 term contingency on her wrist. 

Maybe go through the Cooper textbook for ideas.

I also think Skinner's glasses would be really cool."
Psychiatry,eua4q0i,t1_eu9te0m,1563601022.0,Such a good recommendation! I love Oliver Sacks
GradSchool,eu6esqt,t3_cex0qv,1563498664.0,"What you expressed is 100% what I felt at the end of my program and even now, 2 months after I graduated from my masters. I have no clue what I am going to do anymore. Part of me wants to complete my 400 hours of internship left in my behavior analysis career and sit for my exam but another part of me is so over this, drained, unmotivated and completely wanting to get out of this profession all together. You're not alone. Most days I cant stand my field anymore. I too feel like I wasted 3 years and a shit ton of money and time. This is what helped me: I attend conferences when I can, to spark that inspiration and motivation again, I reach out to colleagues, friends in the field and supervisors to help advise me because they usually always understand my frustration. I also have been researching other things that I can do with my degree besides the main thing that its used for. Talk to people in your field it really helps, especially people you trust and have a connection with. Burnout is high with people in higher education. I hope you find the answer and help you need. Best of luck."
ABA,eu6capy,t1_eu4wa9x,1563497008.0,"I can totally understand that. You can be relatable and keep things light and appropriate and professional. I tend to keep anything unrelated to programs very surface-like and will use humor and genuine interest when talking about things that aren't behavior analytic. A lot of people don't think we should talk about anything other that ABA in the homes but for me, I can't operate that way. I need some way of getting buy in from families and a way of connecting with them. 
i.e; I see a dad watching a baseball game as I'm finishing up paperwork and lets say he doesn't participate in session much. I'll make a comment about how its been a while since I've been to a game and has he been to any this season yet? (i won't say that I go and have beers or that I went the night before or anything). I'm glad this helps! :)"
BehaviorAnalysis,eu3h7yv,t3_ccaw9x,1563414609.0,Amazing. Thank you for posting this.
BehaviorAnalysis,eu3gb5y,t3_ceij7b,1563413915.0,Send your tracker to the BACB and make sure you have the latest version (2.0)
BehaviorAnalysis,eu3g2qj,t3_cedp9b,1563413737.0,Don't come to the US. We have Trump as the president. Stay in Canada cause that's where I'm trying to relocate!
GradSchool,eu3fxr6,t3_ceebb4,1563413630.0,"THIS. YES. Everything you said is exactly how I felt in my program. I learned that there is so much more to life and myself than what I was studying and preparing my career for. To me, going to the conferences and talking with people began to feel like some competition or popularity contest of who was doing what research, who was getting into PhD programs, etc. Then I finished my program and realized that your academic achievements are not what define you and I feel bad for those that think that."
ABA,eu3fm3g,t3_cej8ls,1563413388.0,"I've struggled with this a lot as well because I am very outgoing and love to talk to people. I've been working on this by slowing down when I am talking to families/others and thinking more about what I am saying or being more mindful of what the topic is. I used to just talk and not hold back because I enjoyed the conversation but then I overshared. Try to slow down and pause, reflect on what you're talking about. You can be yourself without sharing too much and stay professional. Don't open up as much and keep things light and relatable. Just keep practicing :)"
depression,ethxcgz,t3_cbj98m,1562830352.0,"I've recently realized that I spent the last 3 years of time, energy, and thousands of dollars on a master's degree in a field that I cannot stand anymore. And I have no idea what to do with my life. help. omg"
AskReddit,ete3i6j,t1_etcer3l,1562721996.0,OMG such a twisted movie that left me feeling awful afterwards. My mom apologized for taking me to see it because she didn't realize it was going to be that bad.
