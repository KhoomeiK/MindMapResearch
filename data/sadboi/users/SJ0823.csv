I went to a residential program specifically for teen girls experiencing Emotional Disregulation and we did DBT all day. I think there is validity in diagnosing someone under 17/18 with BPD especially when their symptoms are apparent. I am a quiet BPD so my symptoms have never been obvious to the outside world. But I am surprised that the topic of being diagnosed with BPD never came up after I was hospitalized 5 times in 6 months (and I was in residential for 3 of those 6 months). They discussed bipolar disorder, but my mood swings didn’t meet the criteria for bipolar. The reason I wished I would have been diagnosed sooner is because I know that some medications (although there are no BPD medications) have had luck treating BPD and I wish I could have tried those sooner."

You can’t blame the companies because everyone (workers, government, companies) are all going to make the decisions that they have to make to do what is best. 

You can hold two truths at the same time. You can say “wow this is devastating” and “I appreciate that everyone is doing the best they can” at the same time. You can be upset and angry and acknowledge that you know there is no one you can direct it at.

I was simply using this forum to share my personal frustrations and fears because I’m sure they are echoed in may college students. And hearing other individuals fears and frustrations (in my experience) is validating. It reminds us that it’s okay to be upset.

https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ps.201100311
“Further, Linehan has suggested that psychiatric hospitalization may reinforce suicidal behaviors, depending on the function of such behaviors for each patient. From a DBT perspective, if the function of suicidal behavior is the communication of distress or the desire for companionship or avoidance of some aversive process in daily life (including solving one's problems independently), then being hospitalized may inadvertently reinforce the suicidal behavior. “

https://ww1.cpa-apc.org/Publications/Archives/CJP/2005/july/cjp-july-05-livesly-IR.pdf
“Because there is little evidence that hospitalization has lasting benefits or that it is useful in managing parasuicidal behaviour or threats, inpatient treatment should only be used when there is no other way to ensure safety.”

https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/pedi.18.3.240.35443
“Hospitalization is of unproven value for suicide prevention and can often produce negative effects. Day treatment is an evidence-based alternative to full admission. Chronic suicidality can best be managed in an outpatient setting.”


https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3811088
“Repeated hospitalizations seriously hinder the adolescent's normal functioning. Things go quickly in young patients' lives, and being away can rapidly degrade their social network, just as not attending school will likely delay them academically, which may increase pressure and stress. Being in hospital will prevent dealing with interpersonal conflicts or misunderstandings, which are often the trigger of the gesture, and then create an overrating of the problem by the youngster. Hospitalization may also reinforce pathological behaviors and make the patient worse.”"
BPD,faor7cy,t3_e9w3pv,1576270727.0,"So here the thing. Personality disorders can be diagnosed in teens. Frankly, I think it’s not a bad idea. I was displaying clear BPD signs at 12 years old when I was first hospitalized. I was reckless, engaging in ED and SH behavior, having way too emotionally intense romantic relationships. When I was 16 I was inpatient 5 times in 6 months and still displaying clear BPD signs. Everyone on my treatment team agreed that I depression was not quite fully encompassing of what I was going through. The diagnosis of bipolar disorder was considered but my cycles of highs and lows were to rapid to meet the criteria. No one every thought to even consider BPD at the time because you are all right, it’s not common and most psychiatrist do not feel comfortable with labeling a developing child/teen with a personality disorder unless they can be absolutely certain.

But the research is there, children show signs of BPD. Teens have BPD. And more importantly, early intervention can save lives. Treating BPD isn’t like treating depression. Hospitalization is thought to be an absolute last resort for BPD patients, and should be avoided. Otherwise rapid cycling in and out of inpatient is common. But it’s hard to use the proper treatment protocol with teens if you don’t know that they have BPD. 

Once upon a time, personality disorders were not diagnosed in anyone under 18, but the medical opinion on that has changed. The DSM allows for children 13+ to be diagnosed with BPD applying the same diagnostic criteria as is used with adults and in severe circumstances it can be diagnosed with extreme caution in children under 13."

It was specifically for adolescent girls struggling with emotional disregulation (we were being treated for BPD before we were officially diagnosed with BPD). It was not-restrictive, we got to go out into the public a lot on field trips (to painting places, to dollar tree, to baseball games). We got to go on high ropes courses and low ropes course and hiking in the woods. We got to go to art therapy and pet therapy. We could play games during breaks between groups. We could play the Wii or watch Netflix together at night. There was more books at our disposal than you could ever imagine. We got to go kayaking and paddle boarding on the lake. We had school time every day so we didn’t get behind in school. Our groups were DBT skill intensive (3 hours a day of DBt skills). We had individual therapy once a week. We had family therapy once a week. It gave me a chance to get away from the world, focus on treatment and calm down.

In regards to self-harm, I avoid it by waiting out the urge. I’ll scream, I’ll cry, I’ll rock back and forth and hit my pillow and just let all the emotion out.
