He had never wanted for anything in his life, so it wasn't the same thing to him it is to normal people. I'd also add he is very detached from society, I'm only his friend because we grew up playing games together. And he likes me because I never ask him to find my business ideas etc.

My main point of contention is that I have played paintball, and others play paintball recreationally. People shoot at eachother for fun and enjoyment with these weapons. The only pertinent protection is eye protection, which I do conceded is a danger; however I feel this danger can be mitigated simply by turning away/moving away/protecting your eyes till you can move away. You however are resolved in this situation that it is justifiable that if you draw a firearm on them and the don't stop firing at you that you should shoot them. I haven't taken the courses you have, but my knowledge is that the drawing of a firearm is an act of escalation. We disagree what their stupid prize should be, I feel it should be satisfied by the law, you have decided you should satisfy it what I would judge to be an emotional capacity.   


I think the only caveat would be if someone had a condition that caused it to be life threatening, I don't know what this would be, or if it exists. And even then I feel they would have to be able to not  extricate  them from this situation in a reasonable way.   


I can't say if I would exercise the freedom if I had it. It would depend on the capacity, would I like it if I could enjoy these freedoms recreationaly? Yea I definitely would, I think they can be enjoyed in a manner that is safe and doesn't inhibit anyone elses life. I also accept that I enjoy a level of safety and lack of fear when it comes to being assaulted by a firearm due to my countries laws and I'm happy for that.

My take is that there's narratives that each interested party are going to push and they will all be bending the truth to some degree whether wilfully/ignorantly/deluded. I think left and right wing are terms to incite division, most people likely agree on most issues. But if you create division, foster echo chambers etc. you end up with hatred that's potentially built on utter nonsense that pushes polarisation."

I dislike that he's decided people on his side are good, and anyone disagreeing with him is bad. That's a poor way to resolve an issue and you've bought into it. I made valid points, everyone deals with stutters. We most likely know the reason. We know their planned solution. They work on it every single patch.

Stutters for me are better than they were when I started playing in early 2018. The devs have acknowledged it and have been working on it for a long time. It's a unity engine issue and not a simple fix. There's the potential that with them moving to the unity 2019 build it may be resolved entirely.

Rust suffers from the exact same issues and also runs on unity. So maybe people are having a discussion, and just aren't in full agreement with you. Beyond arrogance to assume that people on your side = good people. Maybe enjoy the discussion instead?"

EscapefromTarkov,fp2ua0t,t1_fp2q81z,1588267995.0,"I tend to agree with the points they made, the really struck me as the exact kind of manipulative behaviour I've encounter in my life. It's not that the information isn't credible, it's how it's used and the assumptions it forces. All of this is kind of moot however because they said themselves that they were playing it up to help sway their case.

I feel cheating comes with a certain level of delusion and entitlement, which wouldn't be hard to make it feel and appear credible in their own mind. We don't know if they cheated or not, but they've created a shit storm and drama based on very little evidence of what actually occurred. I think when someone has been banned for cheating having a fair amount of skepticism is very very reasonable. If you follow them, they say whatever they need to comment to comment and aren't super consistent. Maybe I'm an asshole. But their reason for not posting the video changes from conversation to conversation. One time it's people can't see their in game name because it's against sub rules, another time they just don't want to give it out. Another time it's because it wouldn't help their case. Yet they state to someone else that the video has been seen and shows 'what he saw shouldn't be bannable'.

I get they might or might not have been cheating, but they have been banned. So I'd argue based on that it's more likely they are being dishonest, which aligns with my experience on forums of people coming along claiming false bans."
