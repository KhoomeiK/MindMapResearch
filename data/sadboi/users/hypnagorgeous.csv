DecidingToBeBetter,f4kynzg,t3_dkvsx1,1571659812.0,"Yess. I’ve had that problem too and I’ve emerged from it squeaky clean with no icky residue of that need. Let me try to explain my process and I hope it may be of some use to you. 

When I reached the tipping point where I was disgusted with my behaviour, I deleted all of my social media, took a Good.year-long.break. When you do that it’s easy to find yourself in a place of self loathing because you experience intense withdrawals from suddenly having 0 validation. But just like any other drug, you have to get through this stage of withdrawal without relapsing, this is the HARDEST part. But doing this successfully will give you a surprising amount of clarity. 

Second. Replace your drug (validation)with something that will enrich your personality. You love reading? Making art? Do it. Even if your passion is something like shopping, immerse yourself in it. By that I don’t mean clean out your bank account, I mean, learn the nitty gritty of it so you can use it in your life in something like a career path maybe? Go back and try to remember your hobbies, and cultivate new ones. If it doesn’t spark joy? Get rid of it. 

Basically the 2nd step is all about building a character that you would enjoy reading about in a story except the character is you. 

These two steps pretty much sum it up. I’ve had to go back and forth a lot and some days will obviously be more frustrating than others. The person I am now is not a perfect self sufficient badass but oh god do I LOVE who I am now. Not craving validation is just a nice side-effect of self love."

You know what it is?"" but none of my family/friends could smell it and would look at me weird after I did this a couple times. I recently smelled it again and out of frustration I did some google fu and apparently there are things such as olfactory hallucinations (harmless). I'm not saying that's what it is, but it's a possible explanation. It could also explain why people would always get it wrong, because they weren't smelling the smell that you were smelling."
