reactivedogs,fo3734i,t3_g5ek2i,1587481768.0,"Look into clicker training and counter conditioning. 
Basically when your dog sees the stimulus you click and the dog will turn back to you and receive a high value treat. Dog eventually learns to associate the trigger with a treat and becomes non reactive.
It takes time and many baby steps to get to that point. 
There are many  positive reinforcement behavioralists that are willing to do video counseling. Not sure if the one I know would be willing to do it for places out of the USA but you can ask them, dm me if you want. Also there many free resources on the internet, google engagement training.
For the mean time though. You need to be able to bring your dog out safely. Consider a gentle leader, a head harness that goes around your dogs muzzle but still allows your dog to bark, eat and drink. This will give you more control over your dogs face, allowing you to prevent your dog from hurting the other dog if they sneak up on you. But the gentle leader needs positive association training and should never be used to pull a dog (except in emergency or to prevent emergency) also the gentle leader would allow you to train your dog, unlike a muzzle that restricts food access. 
Best of luck!"

But honestly. Your pup is so young, 10 weeks is still a baby. Just keep walking away and ignoring when he bites and you‚Äôll see progress. Dogs only mature to about a 2-3 year olds intelligence, at adult age. 
So your baby is really that, a baby, patience will win.

puppy101,fo34eza,t3_g5em4x,1587480347.0,"What have you done about the biting and jumping? For my pup we started bite inhibition early, by squealing every time his teeth touched us or our clothes. Some times he‚Äôd get all spazzed up and keep trying to bite us so we‚Äôd walk away and leave him alone for a minute or two. And then re enter the room and ignore him. He‚Äôs 5 months now and doesn‚Äôt mouth. 
He also went through a humping phase, hanging on my leg and humping. I tried telling him off but that didn‚Äôt work consistently. I found that ignoring him and walking away, closing the gate behind me so he can‚Äôt follow me and then re entering when he‚Äôs calmed down helped. He doesn‚Äôt hump regularly anymore. 
Also just only petting when your dog is sitting helps. If my dog jumps on me to get my attention it‚Äôs ignored but if he sits and looks at me he‚Äôll get all the love and belly rubs he could want. 
My dog really just wants to be with me 24/7 but there are conditions he needs to follow, like not humping, jumping and biting me. 
Best of luck. It‚Äôs hard having a puppy. It really is. Just know you‚Äôre not alone! And it does really get better with time and practice.

Best of luck.
Also with the guarding,  I recommend buying/making some big meat balls. When your dog is chewing her toy just walk over and drop the meat ball. Then walk away. Eventually she will drop the bone in anticipation when you approach. Keep dropping the meatball and walking away. You can, after awhile of doing this and having her automatically drop the bone, then pick up the bone and give it to her back with two meatballs. you take the bone but she gets paid heavily for it. I don‚Äôt recommend trying to take away the bone if she is showing any signs of aggression. Always read your dogs body language. 
But In general conditioning your dog to associate you with meatballs is really good for your relationship."
