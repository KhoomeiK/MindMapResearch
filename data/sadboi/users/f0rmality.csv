Kathleen Kennedy handles the overarching plot for Star Wars, and also hasn't received a single writers credit. 

https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0005086/filmotype?ref_=m_nm_flmg

The problem in the most recent trilogy was not due to the writers. JJ, Kasdan and Michael Arndt wrote a great first movie. Rian wrote a great second movie. The third movie made the trilogy fall apart not because of JJ's script or story but because Kennedy didn't have a cohesive vision for the trilogy. Making the lack vision and messy overall story for the newest trilogy not at the fault of the writers.

And in most films the director will usually have a hand in writing if not be the primary writer *because* film is the directors medium and their vision is the one that's being enacted."

The prequel trilogy on the other hand had a serious writing problem as the scripts were entirely atrocious. Yet Revenge of the Sith still works despite said terrible script.

But my point was, in film a director is the auteur. Unlike TV where it's the writers or the showrunner. Eg D&DB are GoT, and Vince Gilligan is Breaking Bad. But nobody says ""ah yes the classic Joseph Stefano film - Psycho"""

When all Elliot actually needed was his sister - someone who loved him, and that he loved. When he couldn't have that, he had nobody to ground him and his anger let the Mastermind take over to try and achieve something which in the end was irrelevant to him.

It's not about changing the world, that didn't matter to the real Elliot. There's a reason all that stuff was dealt with before the finale. It was always about Elliot and Darlene. About connecting with people, being grounded, not losing yourself. It ends with him finally back, and reconnecting with her. Because that's all that mattered. Getting back to her.

And with Esmail also heading up *Homecoming* I feel like there's a pretty clear theme he enjoys where master plans and schemes for the greater good cause far more harm than good in the long run."

pcgaming,esca1rq,t3_c6yj9p,1561824618.0,"Honestly there's not enough time to play super long games unless they're RPGs like Witcher or Divinity OS2 or have insanely long stories like RDR2. Some of the best AAA games of the last few years weren't super long. Wolfenstein TNO, DOOM, Prey, RE2 Remake, RE7, Evil Within 2 etc.

Even the better open world games were also not crazy long - Horizon, Watch Dogs 2, God of War, Spider Man.

Games I'm never gonna finish? AC Odyssey, Origins, Just Cause 3/4, Persona 5 (though I really wish I could), etc. Those games are too fucking long. Odyssey is stupidly big and around the 40 hour mark I felt like I hadn't even made a dent in it. 

I'd much rather pay full price for a game that's full of quality than half price for a game full of filler. It's a time vs money thing and I personally have more money than time so I've started factoring in game length to purchases but in the opposite way. If a game is short, I'm more likely to buy it right away cause I'll be able to get through it in a week. If it's longer, I know I'll play it for 10 or 15 hours then give up and play something else that came out in the meantime."
pcgaming,es06r2h,t1_es045jo,1561467422.0,I think they're referring to the fact that the game was forcefully removed from sale after a week because it contained a small Easter egg that was a joke about the president of the PRC and then they went silent for months
