The reason you think they are is because of the brain has associated colours to those objects (especially fruits) and them being similar causes you to think they are greens and blues. If you go into some editing software that allows you to copy colour from parts of a picture you can see what I mean"

depression,fgjui67,t3_enrs4c,1580851640.0,"I sympathise with this greatly, I’ve never talked about things and it’s recently been getting to the point of where I can barely go on but I’ve always told myself that everything will be fine and that I’m just overreacting to something so insignificant but there’s a point I reached and I cracked. I’m not the type that anyone I knew would suspect to have anything of the sort because I’m the living embodiment of the big tough guy which doesn’t help much either but one day I cracked and I ended up missing a few days of school because I was sat in my room in the dark wallowing in my problems. It really really does feel as though I’m making something much bigger out of something so small but the first person I decided to start talking to about it didn’t believe me and told me to stop being stupid. Anyone that knows me well enough would agree that what I’m about to say is very hypocritical but talking to someone and finding someone that will listen makes such a difference and it will help massively, I used to say “everything will work out eventually and if it hasn’t yet then it’s not the end.” And I feel like that’s something good to go by."
