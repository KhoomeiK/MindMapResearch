PanicAttack,fr33rlv,t1_fr2gu0k,1589849350.0,"Yeaaaa I feel you, I do like the explanation my psychiatrist gave me. This panic and anxiety are due to a chemical imbalance so it’s an actual physical imbalance in your brain. The medication can help to balance that out.

That being said a lot of people take that along with therapy until they are in a better place then they slowly taper off the pills to see if they can handle it.

You can also always just start with therapy and then introduce a psychiatrist (who can prescribe medicine) from there! 
Best of luck!"

PanicAttack,fr1lhw7,t3_glrpfn,1589821801.0,"I had my first panic attack about 6 months ago and I was CONVINCED it was something physical because all of my symptoms were completely physical. 

First step would be to just get checked out by a doctor. Feel free to go to a few different types of doctors if you want but don't start doctor chasing until you get what you want to hear, trust the doctors you go see.

I actually went to two primary care doctors, two cardiologists, and a neurologist before I realized that maybe I should just take their advice.... 

If they give you a clean bill of health, trust them.

From there I started going to a therapist once a week and saw a psychiatrist once a month or so. Therapy definitely has helped me recognize what I am experiencing and has given me tools to cope with these panic attacks.

I also did not like the idea of going on meds and wanted to deal with it on my own but decided to try out an SSRI because I just couldn't handle the constant feeling of being off every single day so I worked with my psychiatrist on that.

I now do take a pull every day, Celexa, it doesn't make me feel any different though it just makes me feel normal.

I went from a 0/10 anxiety before my panic attacks to a 7-9/10 anxiety every single days for months after my first attack. Every day.

No after therapy and starting my SSRI I am probably at a 1-3/10 every day and my life is really getting back to normal. 

So 1. get a clean bill of health from your doctor. 2. Work on getting your mind right.

Good luck!"

nothing... It doesn't hit you like a ton of bricks or anything like that and over time it will start to help.

I did have side effects my first few weeks, slightly increased anxiety and some bad headaches but those went away after some time and increasing my dose. I am doing MUCH better.

I would say my anxiety used to be at a 6-8/10 every single day for months... it was a nightmare and I thought it was never going to end.

I'd say now I am at a 1-3/10 and live has gotten so much better. It's just about giving it some time, starting your dose slow, and keeping in contact with your doctor.

Truthfully, Ativan has never felt as strong as Xanax, it also takes longer to kick in which may come into play as well since you feel the xanax quicker so it might feel stronger.

When I feel a panic attack coming on, xanax all the way since I know it is going to kick in quicker to help fight the panic.

If I feel some high levels of anxiety but not a full blown panic attack then I might take an Ativan since it definitely does help with the anxiety but it does take longer to feel the effects.

Doctors advice not to take both because they won't want you taking more than your usual dose for both, but taking 1 pill of each at the same dose is basically the same as taking 2 of one. I've taken an Ativan and later taken a Xanax and felt fine (just a lotttt more relaxed).

Truthfully, medication is what has helped me feel normal again, I take 30mg Citalopram a day + xanax during big attacks, does not make me feel groggy or tired or even really happier, just makes me feel normal. I've also been in therapy to learn how to cope with attacks as they still do come.


I know people have had luck getting over this without medication but it is much easier to do so with the help of a professional, so my recommendation would be to reach out to a therapist, even now during this crisis, and start tracking your progress.

A lot of panic attacks are caused by your body suddenly releasing tons of adrenaline into your body and your body reacting to that adrenaline. It's a literal physical chemical reaction that is going on so you can't really stop it once it starts. 

Your body can only release so much adrenaline though and it does take time for it to dissipate throughout your body, I usually set a timer once I feel a panic attack start because I know it can only last a certain amount of time. From there I try to breath and relax or distract myself.

I’d say try to start not with short periods in the car, exposure therapy is supposed to help a TON, even though it sucks you just need to force yourself to stick through it.

Being in an RV with a bed should help a bunch, if you have anything to help with the trip though, benzo or sleeping pills, that might help as a short term fix.

Best of luck!"
PanicAttack,fhule69,t3_f3mu2s,1581887638.0,"Hahaha everything logical goes out the door.

I had a panic attack, heart rate went up to 180. Was told (while not normal) that my heart can take that during an attack and it went down after my attack was over.

Ok fine.

Had a day where my resting heart rate was 59 BPM and went down to a low of 56.

That’s way to low, eventually my heart will stop beating and I will die. Cardiologist said my heart was fine..

Ok....

REALISTICALLY we are fine, but any small thing out of there ordinary I am going to notice, and think it is going to kill me"
PanicAttack,fhuka8b,t3_f433lr,1581887310.0,"That is tough and sucks, I am suffering now and things have gotten better but I’m not 100% ok and I don’t wish anyone went through this.

Because therapy and doctors are so expensive I understand it’s tough to try and make regular appointments, that being said, SSRIs that are used for people don’t work for everyone, for example Citalopram might work great for one person but might make another person feel worse, and Zoloft may make that second person feel way better.

It’s just finding what works for you,  it sure if you tried multiple drugs or not, but might be worth going back to a doctor and testing out another SSRI for at least 6 weeks to see if you have different results.

Best of luck!"
PanicAttack,fhujkkc,t3_f4hdf3,1581887076.0,"Are you saying a cold shower during a panic attack? Or just regular cold showers. I’ve never heard this, but may want to try it if people have said it works!"
PanicAttack,fhuiw0f,t3_f4qf7v,1581886904.0,"I can’t say I’ve had those symptoms, and the first thing I always say is go to a general doctor, explain those symptoms, and get some bloodwork done if you haven’t already done so, it’s always safe to rule things out.

That being said, panic symptoms are insane. What I realize is during a panic attack, the adrenaline redistributes the blood in your body to all your major organs as a safety measure, this leads to the tingly numb strange feeling you feel throughout your body, as well as the nausea that people (myself included) feel. That could potentially explain some of the feelings you felt in your hands leg and face - because they were so intense thought, still smart to check with a doctor.

Because it lasted less than 10 minutes and you were able to get things under control, that is a good thing and if it happens again you know that you can work through it. Wishing the best for you"
PanicAttack,fhraf45,t3_f4hbm0,1581821324.0,"Definitely sounds like the symptoms of a panic attack, that being said, always go to your doctor first, get some general blood work done just to ensure that it isn't anything out of the ordinary.


They really do completely suck, but just know that you've had a few know, and then they have resolved themselves, as in panic attacks are not dangerous and will not kill you. It's hard to think that when they are happening but keeping that in the back of your mind can be somewhat comforting.


If you are getting these symptoms out of nowhere though, doctor first just to rule anything serious out."
PanicAttack,fhplb8h,t3_f4a1sw,1581791805.0,"It literally will be that small trigger that will set off the panic. You may barely feel a tickle in your throat and then leads to thinking about your throat closing and then it escalated from there.


Completely sucks, so much, I’m sorry you have to go through that! I don’t have that reaction but can relate to that escalation. Just know that you didn’t end up dying! If an Ativan calms you down then you can be more certain it’s in your head."
PanicAttack,fhmdfpf,t3_f3vfqn,1581711400.0,"Ugh that is so tough, I’ve been to so many doctors looking into what this is and even with insurance it’s expensive. My recommendation would be to at least get some general bloodwork done by your regular doctor, and if possible, try and see a cardiologist to do an echo, EKG, and maybe holter, just to rule everything out. But it might be expensive so potentially start with therapy, especially since this has happened before, and you’ve been fine after!!

So sorry you have to go through this! It is not fun at all"
PanicAttack,fhfwgn1,t3_f2su09,1581552933.0,"I'm currently taking Celexa now from 10mg -> 20mg -> 30mg, my psychiatrist increased the dosage after it wasn't working the way he wanted it to BUT he said that if it still is not working, we can always move to another med.

From talking to a lot of people on SSRIs, not all meds work for everyone, and sometimes they do but lose their effect over time, so it's totally not out of the ordinary to up your dose or just switch to a new med.

That being said, I would speak with a psychiatrist regarding changing your dose or medication at all."
PanicAttack,fhfw43e,t3_f2rrzl,1581552693.0,"So much! Ugh it saved me in the morning but now I'm too scared to continue drinking it haha, I have moved on to decaf which helps a little, potentially a placebo effect, but I find myself definitely getting tired throughout the day without the real deal....

Maybe one day I'll go back.."
PanicAttack,fheh8n4,t3_ez38cq,1581522355.0,"That sounds horrible, I hate that we have to go through this!

That being said, outside of having to go to the bathroom, these symptoms mirror mine, but instead I get nauseous and puke.... but out of nowhere, my heart instantly jumps to an extremely high BPM, and my entire body feels freezing then burning hot - it feels like icyhot has been rubbed all over my insides in a very uncomfortable way. Plus I feel like I just need to GET OUT and I need to pace around because I'm freaking out so much. 

When this happened the first time, straight to the ER... and I turned out being fine... which is almost annoying, but just know that you aren't alone! It freaks us all out."
PanicAttack,fhe7qu8,t3_f2qcme,1581516012.0,"Unfortunately for me, I feel like there are no triggers to my panic attacks so I feel your pain because it's frustrating when it just comes out of nowhere...

I have also thankfully not been alone during these episodes but I have been preparing myself for a situation where it will happen. Outside of the main tools (breathing, meditation, medication), I have found timing the panic attack has helped. I know it can only last a certain period of time (less than an hour at the most), so setting a timer to see where I am has been very helpful to calm me down since I know how long it can go on for.

Best of luck to you!"
PanicAttack,fhbfxiw,t1_fhbcx9d,1581441483.0,"I guess I'm glad I don't have both types at the same time... but these physical episodes are SO PHYSICAL it's insane. It is just such a full force sensation, how can this be coming from my mind?!?! 


Working through therapy and medication to get this under control, hasn't killed me yet..."
PanicAttack,fhbfac8,t1_fhbdkyr,1581441101.0,"""What's happening to me?! I used to be so normal!""

Feels like the story of my life. I don't wish it on anyone, but I'm glad it isn't just me! And interesting, I hadn't heard about L-Theanine supplements - I'll look into it!"
PanicAttack,fhbeq9f,t3_f23qsi,1581440771.0,"They always say go to your doctor and rule out anything serious first just to be certain because it feels so physical and feels like you are going to die - especially since you passed out.

I'd recommend doing that first just in case, but those symptoms are in line with how my panic attacks feel (outside of passing out). My entire chest feels like it's covered in icy hot, it feels cold then burning hot and tingly. I also get very dizzy and disoriented to where I need to sit down. 

Go to a doctor first though and get checked out!"
PanicAttack,fhbdg5x,t3_f25gq9,1581440015.0,"hahaha I guess that's the only positive I've been thinking, I now know that I don't have a brain tumor, don't have an adrenal gland tumor, I'm not prone to seizures, and apparently my heart looks good after my ultra sound.

The list of tests goes on but knowing that I SHOULD be physically healthy does help out a little!"
PanicAttack,fhbd4nv,t1_fha0mha,1581439825.0,"When I get a full blown attack, it definitely feels like a wave with a definitive start and end. As soon as it starts to accelerate I think of it as a rollercoaster, and I just need to wait until the end. And it sucks the entire time."
PanicAttack,fhbd07z,t1_fha4j16,1581439752.0,"That is a good way to explain it. Though it's in a different area for me, it definitely feels like icy hot. Basically like I drank an entire tub of icy hot... and I'm about to die... that'd be how I'd describe mine!"
PanicAttack,fhbcurj,t1_fha95ur,1581439662.0,"What has been so frustrating is the fact that it can just happen out of nowhere!

The majority of may panic attacks seem to happen when I'm just chilling and doing nothing which just seems so unfair. I know there might be some subconscious force acting on me to cause these but why does it have to happen so out of the middle of nowhere? 

I will try that cold cloth trick next time I am having issues, thanks!"
PanicAttack,fhbcezz,t1_fha975o,1581439398.0,"working through therapy, and medication to try and get it under control! This is no way to live for anyone. Good luck to you as well!"
PanicAttack,fhbcc9w,t1_fhb7ofe,1581439353.0,"I feel like Ive constantly been in this loop for the past 4 months nonstop... am I going to have a panic attack today? then I'm thinking about it, then I feel more anxious, then I think about it more... Even if it doesn't result in a full blown panic attack, the discomfort that comes from the anxiety just completely sucks."
PanicAttack,fhbc67y,t1_fhalaz8,1581439254.0,"you hear panic attacks described like - ""You think you are going to do or you are going crazy""


I wish it just made me feel like I was going crazy! I don't think there is anything more frightening than the physical sensation your body goes through during these panic attacks. People say they understand but you really can't unless you think you are actually going to die."
PanicAttack,fhbbrlk,t1_fhb6aib,1581439013.0,"definitely feels like cold water in the veins and my core! It's such a strange and unpleasant feeling... just makes you think 'whyy meeeee'. glad you are feeling better! I'm nearing 6 weeks on Citalopram but just increased my dosage, hoping for results!"
PanicAttack,fhbbluf,t1_fhbatrp,1581438917.0,It's reassuring knowing that it isn't just me!
PanicAttack,fhbbdrr,t1_fhalli7,1581438781.0,I feel you. I haven't passed out but my first panic attack I got so dizzy and felt so disoriented I found myself stumbling to the ground while trying to get into the ER... not fun.
PanicAttack,fhbb2mw,t1_fhac8ha,1581438596.0,"Uncomfortable as hell is correct! And that is what I've been trying to do... but there is always that 1% nagging in the back of your head that is CERTAIN it is something that will kill you...

Now it's just a matter of getting in control of that!"
PanicAttack,fh9y01x,t3_f1itcs,1581392255.0,"I have Lorazepam and Alprazolam (Xanax), I'll usually take a few mgs when I feel a panic attack come on, and rarely but occasionally if I am feeling very anxious during the day. At most a few times a week but typically less. 

As long as you aren't taking it daily at high mgs you typically won't deal with any sort of dependency or withdrawal symptoms. Take as needed or go see a psychiatrist MD for more medical advice."
PanicAttack,fh9xmkf,t3_f1jq1l,1581391994.0,"My entire body on the inside starts feeling so hot then cold then hot that it MUST be something going insanely wrong, and I'll probably be dead in the next 30 minutes, I always immediately start looking up how far it is to the closest ER...

Then, nothing. Wash down a few Xanax and I'm chill as a cucumber within the next hour. It is so frustrating. I've gone to so many doctors and done so many tests looking for a tumor that they can just take out of me to fix this, but it all goes back to panic attacks due to anxiety. Just started an SSRI, really hoping it helps!"
