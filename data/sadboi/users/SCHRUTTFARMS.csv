A year ago I was put on Betahistine and had a few months of vestibular rehab/therapy and made changes to reduce life stress.  I was attack free until Covid quarantine started in my state.  I've had 5 attacks so far, one was a drop attack (my first ever).  Constantly feel like I will have one at anytime.  I try not to take meclizine as it wipes me out for a day or so depending on the dose.  The last attack I had vertigo for several hours- after 3 doses of meclizine I finally got some relief.  It was easily a trip to the hospital worthy episode but with Covid I couldn't.  I was in bed several days after that attack.  I still feel off."
