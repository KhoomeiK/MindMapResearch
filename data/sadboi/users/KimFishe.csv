amiugly,ffm2ay8,t3_eu0mvr,1580047364.0,"I cant see anything wrong with your looks at all. All you need is a bit more confident and kind expression in general, and your beauty would blossom even more.

As long as you're hygenic and healthy and accept that theres actually good traits to you that you can be confident about, I think most if not everyones beauty would blossom. 

I can tell you from my perspective at least, most guys doesnt look attractive to me in a romantic way before I get to know them on a personal level and learn thry have a lot of beautiful traits that I value. Id say about anyone could be beautiful if they're a good, at least somewhat positive, funny, supporting and trustworthy energy to be around."
AskReddit,fcrkwh8,t3_eihliz,1577903151.0,"1:
How they talks to and about other people. If they're rude to other ppls faces, chances are they'll get that way with you as well. If they talks shit about a lot of ppl, damn sure will talk shit about you too. 

Ofc, this goes the other way around as well. If they talks little/ positive about the people they knows. And ofc to their faces, I'm sure chances are smaller that they're masking their true self, and are genuine.

2:
Patience. 
If a person has patience, shows how little selfish they are, and that they like/ love you for who you are, not for what they can get from you. 

Some people take a looong time to for example ger comfortable to have an intimate relationship. If they start to preassure you into sex, or guilt trip you for it, gtfo. Likewize, if thry respect you, and give you space, and show they care about you in other ways too, thats a good green flag.

3:
How long does it take for someone to get things done?
Ofc, having a lot of health peoblems myself, its underdtandable that there can be a lot of reasons why things can take time to get done.
Its important however. To try to find out why if they're slow to get things done.

If its because they're unreliable, and wont chsnge? Because they're lazy? Because they're depressed or have other health/ mental health related problems?

Remember. The world isnt completely black and white. If someone leaves you because you have health problems, they're not fit to or able to help you. Likewice, if someone is struggling, only you know if your own mental health is strong and stable enough to be there for said person, and see them blossom later. Which brings me to the last one.

4:
Find someone who drags you UP. 
No, not showering you with gifts and comolimments, and no not that and then break you down to make you co-dependant.

Its ok to have arguments. Its natural. Its healthy. What isnt healthy however, is holding a grudge over a long period of time, or having a mentality that they're always right, or that they want revenge or for you to feel guilty. If thats so, GET OUT. NARCISSIST ALLERT.

If however, said person can actually apologize when they did wrong. And doesnt hold it against you. This goes both ways. But yeah, this is a green flag. Unless they always act like above and only apologize if its in their benefits, not because they're genuenly sorry."

&#x200B;

Non ED-Related:

5+ Years ago me throwing up (not on purpose) because of anxiety of having to go to school. Happened a few times in the morning.

I threw up at school once because we had a coca cola/ pepsi max taste test. And I hate cola.

I also have Asperger so I'm very sensitive to smell. My friend at school, who also sat beside me had put on Tiger balsam once, and I got insane migraine and had to go home. Puked when I got home.

&#x200B;

ED-Related ***(Trigger Warning)***

I'm very shameful of all of this, and its still a problem, so plz go nice on me.

Before I opened up to my mom about my eating restricting and purging problems, I went about a half year pretending and eating whatever, and hastily making my way home just to get rid of it again.

I have attempted purge a cupcake at my grandma's house. Bread etc is hard to purge, and I'd basically just swallowed it, and was all panicky because I didn't want anyone to hear me so it was basically just a shameful failed attempt.

I have purged 2-3 times when my little sister has been on sleepover. I have pressured her to eat because of fear of her developing the same shit, and eaten with her, and gotten rid of it without her knowing. 

My mom and I was going to have a movie night. She bought a burger for me. After I ate it I lied to her, said I had a migraine to get her to leave, so I could purge. Whole movie night ruined."
MentalHealthSupport,f4l7y84,t3_ditml5,1571663573.0,"See your doctor, ask for a referral to a specialist on the matter.

I wasn't diagnosed before my late 19's either, even when I brought it up to my (then) therapist at the kids section when I was 17, the therapist just showed utter incompetence and ignorance. She was like ""do you have a toy car or a teddy bear you love and bring with you everywhere?"" I said no ofc, and she was like ""oh ok then you're not on the spectrum""

Saw a rly good competent specialist later when I was hospitalized when I was 19. And he took me very serious, and I got properly tested for it and damn, who knows but turns out I do have Asperger. And it was pretty clear I did as well.

It sucks to not getting properly diagnosed in young age. I could have gotten a lot of support in the school systems and so on. But nah, I was bullied and shunned by my whole class and my teachers, and denied any referrals to someone that could diagnose me. So I just went my whole childhood being bullied and shunned, and not knowing what was wrong with me. Now I have lots of trauma, severe recurrent depression, social and panic anxiety disorders, and avoidant personality disorder, an eating disorder and self harm problems on top of it all. That and a bunch of physical health problems makes it impossible for me to work today...

But at least, getting the diagnosis now, can be very helpful in my future, so for that I'm thankful, and I'm absolutely encouraging you to try getting things sorted out as well."
MentalHealthSupport,f4l6mt9,t3_ditxri,1571663053.0,"I'd say social anxiety is more or less chronic. You'll probably struggle with it in one form or another the rest of your life. But it can get better and manageable, by pressuring yourself to do uncomfortable things, until it gets easier. Medication can help a lot too if that's an option you want to try out.

Bu be careful with what kind you go on, I'd rather recommend a medication that slowly makes you better, and have a lasting effect even after you stop taking it, than one that instantly works then and there, and that can be addictive. 

Hopefully, you don't have more social problems than anxiety that also affects it, so its still manageable. Even though I know its hard, its possible to minimize it."

Refusin to eat after an argument, refusing to eat things she just dont want to. Eating unhealthy at times.. like, either everything or nothing. Which is very similar to mine.

I havent told her about the eatingdisorder Im struggling with. Because informing her of that could just put ideas in her head. Rather, when she brings it up, tell her how dangerous it is and that its nothing to look for, no need to go in depth unless she pushes it. Try positive reinforcement instead. ""Today we find out what to wat together, and if u chose today, i chose tomorrow. Then we make the food together and have a great time, maybe we can watch a movie or play uno as well""

I barely evee talk to hee about how she looks. I could probably have avoided making jokes of myself back when I was obese. But i guess i cant change the past. Ive lost a lot of weight now and Im scared that'll influence her too, especially if she finds out why. Im not going to tell her unless she directly ask me.

Im focusing more on being a generallt supportive role. That she can talk to me about absolutely everything. Embarrassing, scary, sad, happy, funny, anything. And in that, I think I have succeeded.

I think thats whats important. That she knows shes loved. And she knows she has a safe person to come to when she needs to talk, laugh, or just cry and be hugged. That wont get mad, and will always support her no matter what.

Its usually when we feel like we dont have that better, safer coping mechanism. We develope bad ones like self harm, eating disorders and substance abuse."
