I like to be surrounded by good memories to remind myself why I'm living. There are a number of online photo printers that are cheap and they'll deliver right to your door. Additionally, there are so many different ways to arrange them on your walls."

Anxietyhelp,f6vkhn8,t1_f6v3lua,1573189014.0,"Failure is a very real phobia and is certainly at the core of avoidance, at least in my case. I'm glad your fear of disappointing loved ones surpasses your fear of failure. Best of luck with school and all future endeavors."
Anxietyhelp,f6vk6ih,t1_f6vdmkk,1573188716.0,"First, thanks for sharing your experience. I wish you nothing but the best in your journey. 

Your last line, ""Accountability helps but not as much as I wish it did"" resonates with me so much. For me personally, avoidance has continued to be an issue despite the increasing amount of accountability. Letting people down has almost become the new norm. My friends and family are still very supportive however and understand now more than ever the issues with which I struggle."
