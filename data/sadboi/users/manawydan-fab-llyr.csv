> No one showed concern for the workers' health and well-being is because all the bosses acted very nonchalant, which costs 100+ employees their lives; saying that employees can't wear masks cause it'll frighten people and all that stuff. 

I've never heard that said by management, about scaring customers. I won't argue that, it does sound plausible.

However, I have a more cynical view: operating employees are expendable. I hate to say it, but that is the truth. Why take the money out of the budget to provide masks? If the employee cares about their safety, they can go buy their own mask.

Operating employees were provided with hand sanitizer, then some stock taken away because they were using it ""too fast.""

The maintenance divisions have been working with a schedule that give the employees less time on the job, with pay.

The operating divisions, however, are a different story.
Employees working long hours in many consecutive days. Burnout is rearing it's head. It took a long time for them to get PPE, and it is still to this day restricted. An employee who requests a second mask in a day, say because theirs was soiled, will be given a hard time for a replacement, and they need to be more careful.

Unfortunately this has always been the environment in NYCT, this situation no different.

NYCT employees are not alone here. Hundreds of health care workers have followed the same fate, for the same reason. Lack of PPE, from management penny pinching. When the price of this equipment starting going up, employers started deciding their employees weren't that important.

This is a problem with our system, not solely with NYCT.

> The same media/people who treats the TA employees like garbage

While that would be nice, it's never going to happen. Let's be truthful, the media will demonize police, sanitation and firemen as well. The civil service workers are for a large part seen as uneducated scum, deserving only the scorn of the public. They're the reasons your taxes and fares are what they are. They are the evil.

I had a friend, from childhood until my twenties , when I told him to f*ck off. He held the view that public servants were undeserving of their jobs and their salaries because many had not completed college. His mindset was that the only jobs such people were suitable for was to clean floors. Unfortunately there are many, MANY, with a similar mindset. Until that changes, so will the attitude toward public servants, including transit workers.

I would not be surprised to see an increase in anti-public servant sentiment with the number of people losing jobs with this situation.

As you mention, this is to combat the homeless issue, and has nothing to do with those employee deaths.

This is to ""protect"" the riding public.

Equipment that is used by employees alone, likely does not see the same procedures followed.

In the end it really is just for show, more than anything else. The police can remove the homeless from the system, but the next day they'll be right back. The first infected customer to get on in the morning and cough will do quite the bit of damage.

Not to defend the MTA, this is quite the task to undertake. Is it worth it?

It would be interesting to see how many homeless removed from the system would test positive, if they were to be tested. None, or few, of them are wearing masks and have been exposed to the public from the start.

To note, the system isn't shutting down completely. Trains will continue to run, and pick up employees and likely emergency personnel.

You've mentioned Byford in past posts. I would like to believe he'd make a difference, but one must remember it's the management below the head that are also making these decisions. Would he wield enough power on his own to do what would be considered right, or would this be the situation that led to him being pushed out anyway?

We work in a semi-confined space (separate, but open spaces), and this was before the mask requirement. The agency, in fact, was not supplying any PPE and sanitizing consisted of an employee cleaning desks with Clorox wipes. Before I was, I was to contact HR.

HR, for back of better word, interrogated employees. Then placed blame on the employees for not avoiding contact with the unknown infected employee(s).

Not only Subway workers, but police and firemen are at a disadvantage here. Probably a lot more than that, depending on who you ask.

NYS Civil Service law forbids ""essential workers,"" defined as those that would affect public safety (now let's see how broadly the politicians can paint the working population with that brush), from striking. Been there, done that, lost the two days pay for every day on strike - that's the penalty as defined by law. Much of the current workforce was there too, and still have the bitter taste in their mouth.

In fact, it doesn't even need be a strike, but anything those in power determine can be defined as a ""job action."" There's a whole lot to cripple the workforce from standing up.

I wouldn't be surprised to find many other municipalities or states had similar laws that maybe just haven't been tested."

There's a reason for that. It gets those essential workers around. Not everyone in NYC can afford a car (parking sucks, rent is not cheap, and so on), or to rely on taxis and Uber every day.
