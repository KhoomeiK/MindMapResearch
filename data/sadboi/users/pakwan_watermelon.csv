I decided I want to change my doctor kasi pakiramdam ko hindi naman ako nagi-improve dun sa gamot na nirereseta sakin for 2 years tsaka hindi na ako kumportable sa kanya. Nagrerelapse na ako that time kaya ako nagdecide na magpacheck up sa iba. Doon sa bago kong doctor, pinalitan niya kagad gamot ko kasi, may iba pa naman daw medication hindi lang iisa pwede din na combination.  Yun nga lang nung napalitan, lumala ako. Pero pinalitan din yung gamot, may in-adjust sa dosage, may dinagdag. Sa ngayon mas okay naman na state ko. Kino-continue ko pa din meds at checkups.
Medyo awkward sakin nung nagpalit ako ng doctor kasi, uulitin ko na naman na ikwento and sabihin kung ano ba nangyayari sakin. Pero after 2 sessions naman, naging kumportable na ako sa kanya. Bale combination ng medication tsaka therapy ang ginagawa sa akin ngayon."

From where you are now, I have questioned myself too before that there must be something wrong with me. ""I KNOW that I should be grateful for what I have because others have bigger and complicated problems than me, that I should feel my family's love and concern but why can't I feel it? That makes me a horrible person right? because I can't feel the good things I'm supposed to feel"".
I felt so frustrated at myself. I felt hopeless that things will get better. But things do get better, little by little. Sometimes I did not even realize it like fact that I am writing about my feelings and sharing them with strangers on the internet now which, before, would be unthinkable of me to do. 
It is okay to feel the way you feel now but that does not mean you are the negative things you think you are. It is okay to feel frustrated, anxious, disgusted, angry, alone and hopeless at yourself but that does not dictate it would be what you're going to feel throughout your life. It is okay to feel these but things will get better. It's okay to take it slow and take steps back at times but it will be okay."

AlasFeels,fba54as,t3_ebb72c,1576665069.0,"1. Drink your meds regularly. Wag kang magskip dahil sa side effects. Mga 1week ganyan yan. Siguro kasi dahil naga-adjust katawan natin sa narerelease na brain chem or what nung gamot. Or kapag you are feeling better, WAG mo ititigil yung paginom (been there, regretting it now). 

2. Go to your therapist regularly. Same sa meds, wag ka magskip ng session. Diets and excercise, parang ganon. Mahal magpa-therapy same din sa presyo ng meds, I know. But it will be worth it, para sa sarili mo yun. Parang kung madiagnose ka ng may kidney problem tas kelangan ng dialysis, mahal magpagamot pero kelangan. Ganun isipin mo sa gastusin.

3. Drawing, painting, writing, blogging, journaling. Do some sort of activity na magiging outlet mo kapag nararamdaman mo na yung dilim. Folding clothes, magwalis, talking to your stuffed animals, molding clay kahit na anong personal activity. It helps na may outlet, parang vomit kelangan ilabas. Please don't do activities that will hurt yourself.


Sana makatulong."
