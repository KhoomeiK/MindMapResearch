schizoaffective,fqgoc65,t3_gimh6d,1589351933.0,"well, one thing to keep in mind is that lifetime prognoses of scitzoaffective bi-polar disorder is more positive than other diagnosis in the spectrum. Staying in recovery is more likely. 

I'd just keep in mind couple things. You'll need a lot of patience. Episodes can be very tiring. The other thing I would say is parts of this illness can be very dark, strange and/or weird. Try to be as accepting as you can, acknowledging that the dark/strange parts about this illness don't define her as a person.  Best of luck to you man, wish you both happiness."

I've been in relapse for the last year (mostly just drinking), so my enthusiasm is a bit low atm. Still staying in the word and in prayer though. I'm very aware of the dangers involved with benzo's.  Just getting desperate for a way to function in the real world. Your right though, I probably still should avoid them.

I've been through a few deliverance episodes and have gone through a lot of spiritual warfare. I definitely agree with you that most, if not all mental illnesses are heavily intertwined to spiritual matters/roots. I find it hard were to draw the line though, chicken or the egg type of thing I guess. With an illness like SZ or SZA its hard NOT to see a demonic connection lol.

Thank you for prayers, I will continue to pray for you. May you be strengthened according to His glorious might for endurance and patience, and rest in the completed work of our Savior. Keep that garment of praise on over the spirit of despair. The best is yet to come!"
Christianity,fpcb8yb,t3_gcawxu,1588494056.0,"Thank you so much for telling your story. It may seem strange, but it was encouraging for me to hear from someone who struggled and is still finding hope in walking back to the Lord. Praying for you, I'm sure His Spirit is on the move for you. 

I (33m) have a similar story to yours. I got radically saved from drug addictions and trauma. I kept on for quite some time, eventual even stayed clean for the majority of a decade. I feel like the seed sown in the thorns though, everything has been such a struggle . My mental health issues (Schizoaffective) eventually got to the point were sobriety didn't seem to matter one way or another. Sometimes I just want my brain to stop being terrible, even if its just for the night. I feel so worn, but I know I need to still work hard towards recovery and commit to the Lord.

But more to the point, I was getting close to buying a ridiculously large amount xanax, just to try to function and feel normal for awhile. While reading your post I felt the Lord pull me away from the Idea, telling me to hold out. Telling me He will still be my answer. So...thanks. Thank you for your honestly and your heart. Best of luck to you, I will be sure to keep you in my prayers ♥"

Stage one: Feel guilty for drinking and fall apart a little bit

Stage two: Feel less anxious and buzzed. Think about things

Stage three: I'm drunk. Various things might happen here, usually not too bad.

Stage four: Bonus mode is activated! I've probably been drinking for 8+ hours, who knows what will happen now! Psychosis? sometimes. Try to leave my town? Its possible. Drunk sad/ destructive mode activated? its happened before. Completely delusional? Most likely! Walk to the store at 6am for more booze? Sure why not! Leave my house at 3am and talk to strangers at a park? End up at random houses after a blackout? Crying in a closet? Its all possible!

SuicideWatch,fo86epc,t3_g61vpg,1587590725.0,"I've been there before. I had essentially signed my ""death warrant"" as well and the only fun part about life  was using. Tried about every drug you could think off, but as you know its never enough, it wasn't enough to off myself either.  I'm in my early thirties now, and most of my time spent past 18  has been clean and sober. Things got better. I had a long stretch of peace and growing.  I promise you things will get less intense, and in time there will be plenty of ways for you to learn how to cope, if you want to. 

I know how much it sucks to be were you are, my heart goes out to you, it really does. I'll say a prayer for you, and I hope grace and peace will meet you were you're at rn.  I guess what I'm getting at is the will to live is really strong, and we meet people throughout life that makes it hard to 'leave'. Please learn to be kind to yourself. Keep an open mindset, recovery is possible. Life can and will get better. You might decide you want to live one day, and the earlier you put in the work the better.
