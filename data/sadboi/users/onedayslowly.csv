relationship_advice,fcb6kh0,t1_fcaifsg,1577583016.0,"Yeah. I was in a situation like this too. Always complaining about being broke so I didn’t mind picking up the tab when we went out to eat. But when I would suggest maybe we should stop eating out he would get extremely upset about it. The controlling got so bad over the course of the 2 and a half years that he ended up making out my credit card and would steal the change out of my car. By the way, he wasn’t broke like he claimed, just selfish and manipulative. Run from these people."
BPD,f0vywtk,t3_d6esmt,1568995103.0,Yeah this makes me think I’m faking bpd a lot. But then I realize I really spend every waking second in turmoil but just....internally.
BPD,ey83j60,t3_cw16xm,1566910283.0,Yeah. I don’t want to live past 30. I can have good times now but I cannot see myself going past 30 nor do I want to. I would never want to be 45+ and I think 30 is plenty years. I’m 23 now so I have some time to make memories. But my brain just feels like a losing battle most days and I’m just so unhappy. I have glimpses of fun and good memories but they’re few and far between so I will be going out on my terms at some point during 29.
relationship_advice,etxoy6f,t1_etw9nca,1563304131.0,Yeah I used to date someone who would make me give them money for gas every time they came (I lived 45 minutes away) even though I would also pay for whatever meal we ate. People are really shitty.
BPD,epjioly,t3_busg9d,1559254459.0,All the time. I let an “”ex”” (you can’t really call it that - he just cheated on all his girlfriends with me for two years and he became my FP so I would take any apology.) drain me financially. He’s the reason my credit card is maxed out. Wouldn’t even come and see me unless I filled up his tank of gas. I always feel like I need to do something. If I don’t buy everything for friends then they won’t stick around. I met these people out once and literally bought all their drinks despite not knowing them at all just so I wouldn’t be alone. It fucking sucks. But I get it.
relationship_advice,eod5eqi,t1_eocjz88,1558468708.0,Hi! Someone with BPD here! We are not inherently horrible people! Thanks!!
