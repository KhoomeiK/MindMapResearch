Then tell them the lawsuit you're about to bring is going to cost them double.

Listen:
Every company has a magic number where it's worth a quick settlement than to carry out a lawsuit. My old company that number was 64k (I was friends with the legal counsel). 

DO NOT RESIGN. 

Tell them you would much rather a settlement than the viral social media campaign you have on tap betting used to force their hand. 

After stating your demands get up and leave. Do not negotiate on the spot. Let them stew in it. 

They'll call with an offer. Much better than that shit deal you said."

Have you been working with a psychiatrist? Or you're family Dr? Get a psychiatrist. It could have been nothing more than the dosage. Dial yourself in with the right Meds. It took me a looong time to get a correct dosage.

Keep trying. Or else learn the best meditation techniques the best breathing, the best anxiety techniques and then you better do then perfect every day.

Or

Find the right Meds, take your time, get the right doctor, don't lose hope.

I take three diff Meds a day. Did I think I would be dying this? Did I think, 'who needs three Meds, and weed ever so often, to make my Brain work the best for the society I live?'

Yeah, I thought that. But fuck it."

Advice,euwtdm1,t3_chil19,1564079338.0,"You have a right to expect and demand that your SO support you in your times of emotional need. If you can't ask him to do that, then you aren't ready to have sex with him. If you ask him and he can't provide this for you then he's not ready to have sex with you.

I was also raped when I was younger and it had a profound impact on my life. Though, unlike you, I stuck it in a deep dark corner until my 30's. Keep trying to work on your trauma through therapy and remember; you are no longer a victim. That part is over, you are a survivor. Surviving is be tough, but the more you work on it positively the better off you will be. 

Everyone should go to therapy, especially us that went through a major trauma. 

Hope this helps, let me know what happens.

If she's not into texting then try calling her on the phone to talk. ask her about her hope and dreams (in a less corny way). and when she answers, listen.

There is nothing confusing in your scenario, it appears you are interested in a girl who knows not to get too excited over small talk and a date. She wants to see where it will lead. And she's not on much social media, so there's yet another plus for her.

get out of you head - as in, don't over think everything. I know that's hard to do when you like someone."
