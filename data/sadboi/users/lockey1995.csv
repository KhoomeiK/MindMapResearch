Only when conditions allow. Again people that know nothing of cars get shit scared of things they don't understand. Oversteer is where the driver gets scared, understeer is where the driver gets scared. 

In terms of aquaplaning again drive to the conditions if it's tipping it down with rain obviously grip levels change dramatically so you need to use common sense and slow down. Honestly most crashes are caused by distracted driving. I always slow down for other people, i never tailgate i can't stand when people do that."

CoronavirusUK,fmmqwz9,t1_fmmee7h,1586210367.0,"Look at the autobahns in Germany they have less accidents than us with no speed limit, I can tell you're not into cars or particularly spirited driving. In terms of an empty motorway that's nothing maybe with kids in the car it's a bit excessive but i honestly don't see the issues if conditions allow. 

Coming home from work tonight i had some fun down some backroads that were absolutely dead literally no cars. Nothing more stress relieving than the sound of an exhaust and heel toeing down the gears. 

There's a difference between spirited driving and downright dangerous/stupid driving I've seen plenty of the latter, not slowing down when there's others, not knowing the limit of their car and their own limits. Overtaking on solid white lines, overtaking on blind corners which is absolutely stupid and much more.

You'll be surprised what you can do in a car and be totally in control if you know what you are doing."

So I had a go and have been 3D modeling in Maya with my Intuos photo small now for about 2 weeks but there just isn't enough space and it becomes annoying at times. Ideally I'm looking for a medium sized tablet as I'm guessing it's all i will really need only other uses would be texturing inside of Substance Painter and Photoshop.

Not really using it for any sort of digital drawing or anything like that, i decided to swap due to wrist strain after long periods with mouse and I will say even though my Photo is a pain in the arse due to the size my wrists do feel better. Not looking at spending a ton of money so screen tablets are well out of the question. What would you recommend because I can't decide aha.
