First I noticed the extreme fatigue every day & headaches. It literally felt like I had the flu every day for months. The pain from the IUD never went away for me. I always felt like my belly button was being pulled from the inside. It took me probably 6-8 months to realize it was the IUD making me feel this way. And I also gained 30 lbs so rapidly even though my food intake hadn't changed. For me, it was awful. But it does work for many people. I lost all the weight & instantly felt better after I had to tell my gyne to take that thing out because he insisted my symptoms & weight gain weren't from that ðŸ™„ Sorry, almost forgot to answer the ADHD question.
