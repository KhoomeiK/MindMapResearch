You'll come back more motivated. Also it's not a bad  idea to take day here and there where you're looking up tutorials, learning music theory or listening to sounds you're trying to emulate."

I have 256 gb left of storage and have used about that much as well. So space isn't an issue. It's just that massive n omnisphere are so slow with the presets.

Sorry if I'm still not understanding"
FL_Studio,fppyugk,t1_fppynjk,1588811810.0,Yeah. I have at least a thousand presets in nexus n it's fine
FL_Studio,fpplblg,t1_fppj58v,1588804401.0,son of a... I think I have too many presets on massive. Literally takes a couple minutes after every  little thing I do on it. Might have to store some on my external n then switch out every once in awhile I suppose.

FL_Studio,fppjcwf,t3_getg0b,1588803350.0,I think it sounds good as is tbh. Cant go wrong with simplicity when making instrumentals.  Could always use a different sound or slightly different melody at a different part of the track and make your arrangement unique.
