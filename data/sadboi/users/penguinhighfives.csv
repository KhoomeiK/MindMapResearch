bipolar,f3mpo83,t3_dhclez,1570991041.0,"All the time. I’m on Lamictal  too and it helps a lot. Thankfully no side effects. If you have only been on it 3 months but it is helping just call the doctor. It takes awhile to get the right dosage. I still have racing thoughts sometimes but much easier to deal with through controlled breathing.

Edit: if you feel like “this isn’t too bad, I can do it without medication”—the medicine is working and you probably need to stick with it. Or at least, usually the case for me."
BipolarReddit,f33ji5z,t3_dfjig3,1570639723.0,"I’ve felt that way too. A lot. Sometimes “fighting” is just not giving up. 

Also, I *hate* the term “man up”. I wouldn’t listen to the opinion of anyone that uses that phrase."
BipolarReddit,f33fi23,t3_d8vbem,1570637659.0,"This! This is the reason I’m terrified to go in for treatment. My family doctor said I probably have bipolar II and set me up with psychiatrist for official diagnosis. That was 3 years ago and I still haven’t gone because I don’t trust doctors.

I’m really sorry this happened. People are crappy."

Some girls are really shy about talking about sex and others are very open. If she’s open, she will appreciate your honesty."
