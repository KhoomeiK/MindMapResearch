There is a medication out there (unsure of name) that supposedly decreases the sweating; my psychiatrist brought it up but I declined. I‚Äôd rather fight with the sweat. Only tips I can really give are: toying with deodorants (clinical strength!), keeping yourself cool with a fan or A/C, keep water constantly around to rehydrate and maybe keep some extra undershirts in your car or desk at work just in case you need it. 
Antidepressants, among other medications, can interfere with our body‚Äôs internal temperature gauge.
