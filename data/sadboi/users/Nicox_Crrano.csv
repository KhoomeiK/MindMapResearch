Ok, here in Spain we supposedly have a socialist/feminist/proLGBT advicate of progressiveness government. That's all fine and good to me until you notice that *they just realised covid was a fucking problem right after the 8M*. The spanish feminist lobby is a great source of votes for them, so even knowing the risk they were taking (well, not they cuz the ones who went to the demonstration wore masks and gloves to prevent getting infected without warning any of the street people to do the same) they called for us to go. And we know they knew about the virus already in early february because one of them let it slip in an interview. After all of that bullshit from the government they didn't even regulate the prices of masks so we were buying them for about 7 euros the first two weeks (the disposable ones mind you). Then they lied to us about the quick tests, saying they were distributing them to every public hospital and the truth is that only infected people can have them when it comes to actually getting it done to you. I myself have athsma and I don't even know if i, my friends or my family have it.
Then comes the phases of the de-escalation (which is how they called the act of progressively getting out of confinement), which are confuse as fuck and they are changing every so often so you never know how much and when can you be on the street. Not to me tion that our dear government lied a couple times about statistics of the covid making it seem less serious. This abismal administration got a lot of deserved complaints from the politically opposite parties and, obviously, it all turned into a room of biased monkeys throwing their own shit at each other.
And no, people are not respecting the social distancing rules at all."
