Dogtraining,fp17d8a,t3_ganu30,1588226495.0,Also really doesnt seem fair of your family member to not budge on putting her cats away so that he can have some roaming time. I understand that it's her house and everything but a little flexibility would be kind. Especially since cats sleep most of the day and probably wouldnt give a poop about being confined to a space for a couple hours.
Dogtraining,fp1774y,t3_ganu30,1588226354.0,"Definitely seems like he's not getting enough physical or mental stimulation. Can you just walk him around the block or anything? Not sure how strict the orders are where you are. Also you could try a puzzle toy or kong, or even a treat in an old sock/cereal box for him to rip apart- just to get out some of that pent up energy. Last week I tried putting some treats in tissue paper and a paper towel roll and stuffed them inside a cereal box. I let my dog go to town ripping it up and it kept her pretty entertained for a while! Yea, you have a mess to clean up, but it was a small price to pay to see her happy! 
Best of luck!"
