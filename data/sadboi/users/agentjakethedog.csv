careerguidance,fn4gnxk,t3_fz8i3l,1586641006.0,"Hello,

I definitely understand, I was really depressed during winter break and was losing all hope for my future. I thought I had a plan for a career change but career advisors (I saw three!) kept shutting me down and told me it wasn't worth the time. I was having problems picking a career since High School. I wanted to be a nurse but I didn't like chemistry. I decided to be a lawyer so I can protect the voiceless but after two internships, I wasn't enjoying and lost the passion/motivation for it. A few months ago, I went to go see a therapist and I swear it really helped me. Everything was going smoothly until COVID-19 happened and the lockdown got extended so yeah my mental health has been up and down lately.

But here something that really helped me:

Have you tried a personality test? (ENTP, INFJ, etc.) I know that is a really dumb idea but my university makes the undecided majors do it to narrow down some career paths for the students to do research on them. I heard it helps a lot of students get an idea of what they want to go into. It is sorta like a self-assessment (EX: What are your key values? what soft skills do you possess? What are your technical skills?)

If you don't wanna do that (that's fine!), It's a good idea to self-reflect. Before you choose a career, you need to learn about yourself. Reflect on the kind of work environment you want to be in, the type of work you enjoy, etc. Then, identify your must-haves. Everyone is unique with what they want in a job such as are there certain tasks you want to perform (EX: Do you want a job where you work with people all day?), is there a certain salary you want, do you want a job that travels, is there a certain work environment you cannot work in, etc.

After understanding your needs in a job, start researching jobs that sound interesting to you. You might find something that is interesting. Maybe find some interesting industries you would like to work for one day and see what jobs they have to offer. Try to narrow down your list when you're finished. Pick the 3-5 careers that interest you the most and do more in-depth research on them (day in the life, salary, job requirements, growth opportunities, etc.). This is optional but conduct information interviews after the lockdown and when life gets back to normal. Meet people in the occupation and ask them a bunch of questions (EX: what kind of education did you get? What is the type of work you do all day?) It's giving you firsthand knowledge of the field from some who has probably been in it for some time.

I know that was lengthy but all of that advice really did help me move forward about my future. Life is about learning and growing so you'll def. find something you'll enjoy :)"

Now I'm temporarily back home, taking all online courses, no work, no therapy, and waiting for this all to be over. School was escape from my family and living by myself was a little more peaceful. I never got to say goodbye to my friends who are forced to leave their dorms and I don't know if I'm going to be having a commencement. 

This pandemic is really eye opening. It made me realize how much I miss the outdoors and missing the small things in life. 

Idk how long I'm going to be here at home with my family, but I want to take the time to start planning the next chapter in my life. Getting ready for the real world, looking at big girl jobs, looking into grad schools, searching for apartments, and finishing my undergrad career strong.

overcoming,fctnyco,t3_eiu5dl,1577950806.0,"I would say  it's okay to stay single as long as you want. 

We get amount of pressures to not be single, and this starts when we were teenagers. Films and TV shows show characters getting into fully functional relationships in High School and we think that's normal. There's a lot of people who don't have boyfriends/girlfriends at school, in their teens, and there's nothing wrong with that. There's people out there who haven't found their soulmates until they were 28. 

I'm 22 and never been in a relationship. In my teens, I was considered the ""weird"" girl who was socially awkward. I went to homecoming and prom with my friends because no boy really wanted to take me lol. I mean it did low-key suck seeing all those promposals and hearing about the other classmates prom dates but 5 years later it doesn't really matter. It was all about having fun with the people you're graduating with that night. Entering college, I thought I was going to find my future husband because I kept hearing all those ""I found my soulmate in college stories"" but I came to realize it doesn't happen to everyone. I made amazing friends in College and I wouldn't change a thing in the world for that.

Advice,fcne2rc,t3_ei4apw,1577809778.0,"Breaking from social media can be really difficult. Trust me I've been there. I'm quitting some social media since it was taking a toll on me and a obsession with a celeb (another story for another time). After a while I saw how much it was affecting my mental health. Also, I saw how much I was losing touch with reality and needed to snap out of it. 

I would really sit down with her and discuss about it. Tell her you care about her and how the addiction could get worse. Mention how it can take a huge toll on her child. I wouldn't take her phone away or make her delete all her social media at first since that can lead to negative results. I would take it slow such as turning off notifications or limit herself. Maybe you can help her create a schedule? Like 10 am to 11 am she can go out for breakfast with either you to catch up or her son and talk about school. Then, around like bedtime she can be on her phone.  

Did she have any hobbies? Activities? Maybe she can bring those back and you'll notice a decrease in social media because when I did this I know it help alot :)

This probably wasn't the best advice but hopefully it's a start. Sometimes you got to let other people know they're loved and there's more to life than posting a picture everyday or recording a snapchat video. 

Definitely tell her she's beautiful no matter what other people think of her on Instagram :) everyone is beautiful in their own way."
paralegal,fcn3a5n,t3_ehwc6e,1577802065.0,"I know some paralegal alumni who graduated in a program I'm in and they switched different fields, some making more or less money in the field they switched to.

Not everyone is going to enjoy the type of work they're going to be doing. :) 

I know some alumni who switched from personal injury to real estate. Was it completely different work and difficult to figure out? Yeah but they enjoyed it better than personal injury. Attorneys will probably understand and train you. This might be off topic but some paralegals will use their degrees for a different career like Human 
Resources or public relations."

paralegal,f7drw2z,t3_duhpzh,1573627141.0,"I'm in school right now for Paralegal and currently doing an internship. So hopefully I can help a little bit! School for me so far isn't that bad. I really do enjoy the classes and it's really nice because they offer a variety such as contract law, tort law, trademarks, etc. to help you prepare whatever field you go into. 

Long Hours: Again, I'm an intern so I'm only there for a short amount of time through out the week. I did talk to one of the Paralegals there my first few days asking about the profession from someone who has been in the field for a while. She mentions that a lot of people worry because they're afraid of being stuck in the office for an extra two hours to finish a task that was assigned by the attorney. She said that it's usually a 9-5 job Mon-Fri with the weekends off. You don't take any work home because what happens or is said in the law firm stays in the law firm due to confidential information about clients, businesses, etc.  

Dress Code: Depends. At my firm, Fridays allows casual wear like jeans and a (appropriate) shirt. The paralegals there usually wear business casual Monday - Thursday. Just nice dress pants and blouse works. When we have a client come in or they're off to a court hearing they tend to dress more formal but again, it does depend where you work. 

Phone Calls: Again, depends because you could just be drafting summaries and memos while the attorney makes the calls. I have talked to other students in the program who are doing internships and they either do or don't. When they do, they take small steps because sometimes it can be overwhelming. I learned in class you might be setting up interviews outside the law firm so the attorneys might make you set up the interview time and place. I'm just happy I got some experience at a calling center because it really did help me with my communication and problem-solving skills. 

Other things: It's not that bad at all! One thing is multi-tasking and I'm still learning how to handle it. Right now, I'm working on 3 separate assignments for three separate cases but don't let that get to you because I got done with one of them the day it was assigned to me so it's not that bad. Again, you're going to have to do an internship because you need the experience and it's really going to help you down the road. Finally, it's an awarding job :)"
NoStupidQuestions,f7dq3ln,t3_car8k3,1573625042.0,"It's hard getting over someone you really have a huge crush on especially crushing on celebs because they're cute, rich, and everything you want in life.  You just got to keep in mind that they're a person following their own path in life. You also want to keep in mind that you're probably just seeing the surface of them. They may be humble and sweet on social media, interviews, etc. but they can be a totally different person with their private life. It's just better to ""break up"" with them and focus on you. Set goals, finish school, hangout with your friends and maybe you'll run into that special someone. Trust me, I'm going through it and it sucks but knowing that your focusing on yourself instead of them can really help you improve. :)"
