I honestly don't know what you're trying to say there. That's not a definable word in English, at least that I can find. 

I wasn't going into a religious sub and starting arguments. I simply refuted their claim that their church is ""doing great on the LGBT front"", because they're not. Someone saying any group is welcoming while making stipulations about what they will accept isn't really being welcoming. That's just saying they tolerate our existence, as long as we don't have sex or get married. The Church of England even has stipulations on what trans people they will accept, ie not people who were originally in a same sex marriage. 

I'm not stooping to some T_D user level or their ilk, there's no third grade name-calling, profile stalking, or other general douchey crap they pull. I was just pointing out the statement they made was false. 

If they didn't want to hear other's views on their religion, they probably shouldn't have started talking about it on a sub of people who have been demonized by said religion. There are religious subs were that talk is welcomed. This is LGBT+ people firstly, not religious people. You would think that would take precedence here.

Edit: So you can only edit your comment and not respond, okay. Also, excoriative is not a word either. The word excoriate only has the forms excoriate, excoriated, or excoriating. You should probably know what a word is before you try to use it."

Sitting back and allowing abuse is the same as doing the act yourself. It's neglecting to protect a child and enabling abuse at the same time."

Yeah, that screams there's something mentally/physically out of your control happening. 

I don't have issues keeping up weight, but I'm seriously out of shape. My dad struggled though. He was constantly eating high protein, calorie dense food, and it barely made a difference. I don't think people realize that underweight people are more at risk for serious health problems than overweight people either, which makes questioning anyone's weight that much more shitty. It was reported a 140% increase in early death risk in underweight men, and 100% increase in underweight women. Whereas obesity is only a 50% increase."
