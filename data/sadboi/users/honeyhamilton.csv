>I waited patiently – years – for the pendulum to swing the other way, for men to start reading Jane Austen, learn how to knit, pretend to love cosmos, organize scrapbook parties, and make out with each other while we leer. And then we’d say, *Yeah, he’s a Cool Guy.*  
>  
>But it never happened. Instead, women across the nation colluded in our degradation! Pretty soon Cool Girl became the standard girl. Men believed she existed – she wasn’t just a dreamgirl one in a million. Every girl was supposed to be this girl, and if you weren’t, then there was something wrong with *you*.

>…I hated him for not knowing it had to end, for truly believing he had married this creature, this figment of the imagination of a million masturbatory men, semen-fingered and self-satisfied. He truly seemed astonished when I asked him to *listen* to me. He couldn’t believe I didn’t love wax-stripping my pussy raw and blowing him on request. That I did mind when he didn’t show up for drinks with my friends. That ludicrous diary entry? *I don’t need pathetic dancing-monkey scenarios to repeat to my friends, I am content with letting him be himself.* That was pure, dumb Cool Girl bullshit. What a cunt. Again, I don’t get it: If you let a man cancel plans or decline to do things for you, you lose. You don’t get what you want. It’s pretty clear. Sure, he may be happy, he may say you’re *the coolest girl ever*, but he’s saying it because *he got his way*. He’s calling you a Cool Girl to fool you! That’s what men do: They try to make it sound like you are the Cool Girl so you will bow to their wishes. Like a car salesman saying, *How much do you want to pay for this beauty?* When you didn’t agree to buy it yet. That awful phrase men use: “I mean, I know *you* wouldn’t mind if I…” *Yes, I do mind.* Just say it. Don’t lose, you dumb little twat."

From the article: coronavirus is both deadlier (2% fatality as of now vs. 0.1% for the flu) and more contagious (each person with coronavirus appears to infect 2.2 other people vs. 1.3 for seasonal flu). Additionally, coronavirus can spread prior to a person exhibiting symptoms, making it even harder to contain.

Hopefully these stats go down over time as scientists have more data available, but meanwhile I do think it's important to be aware of the facts in order to take appropriate precautions."
