depression,f8nap4k,t1_f8n7zi2,1574641184.0,">still hate myself despite being the straight A student

Straight A's are good but nothing to be super ecstatic about unless you want to go to college. I was a C's and D's student with an extremely passive mom and a dad who wasn't involved, and I wasn't any happier than you are. I drank vodka in the bathroom stalls, abused alcohol since I was 16. I think if I did things differently it wouldn't have made me any less susceptible to the negative thoughts that seem to be rooted into me.

I think you're overthinking the second reason for sure. She cuddled with you and went on a date so obviously she feels something. But even if she decides she doesn't want to be with you its not worth the anguish. I've had my pain and binge drinking from girl related shit, but I'm telling you it's not worth it. Don't obsess over the things you can't control, even though as an overthinker, you think everything that goes wrong is the result of you not having enough control. Let it go or it will eat. you. alive. And stay off the sauce, because believe me it might feel good to get drunk, but its just a form of escapism that will lift you up, and then drop you into a deeper hell than the one you drank yourself out of."
