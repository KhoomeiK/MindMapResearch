bipolar2,fj0yepx,t3_farb9s,1582909790.0,"Something I have found that helps me read lately is to go to a place I enjoy hanging out at by myself, usually the park. Being out of my ""comfort zone"" aka my room/house, forces me to do something else with my time. The park where I live by also has a cafe, so it's even more incentive to just, ""be"". I can only ever read during really bad bouts of depression though, if I'm out and about with high energy I'll walk around and talk to strangers.

  
I would suggest Audiobook if you still have trouble reading, it's one of my favorite substitutes when I can't concentrate/focus visually. Also! don't get discouraged if you do pick up a book and only read a couple pages or so, as long as you wanted to do the thing you wanted to do, it's a start. I hope I was of help in some way."
bipolar2,fj0x4sd,t3_faxhp1,1582909193.0,"Good morning to you as well! I'm glad you got a new job recently, keeping busy for me has done a lot of good for me I feel like. I wanted to say thank you for posting this, was having a rough morning and seeing this helped me remember I'm not alone with how I feel and think (seems like it is constant), it's hard going through the motions of things sometimes.

You have an awesome day too, and a lovely weekend"

bipolar2,fga6vis,t3_exi72l,1580647498.0,">For a long time I really had felt out of place because I didn't know how much of my personality was mania and how much my personality was actually myself. 

I really felt this as I read it. Currently going through a ""phase"", and while it feels *really* nice not feeling so low and being able to do things I enjoy again; I find myself asking, 'is this really me right now, or is it the mania'? 

Thank you for sharing your thoughts, it's nice not being alone in this."
