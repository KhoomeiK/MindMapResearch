Anxiety,flkmvnh,t1_flkm7f6,1585243881.0,"Yep! Well at least I believe so. I went to get tested at the drive through testing site in New Rochelle. I exhibited some symptoms and was in contact with 5 people who were confirmed cases (thankfully, mine was negative!), so after about 5 days of waiting after speaking to someone on the state coronavirus hotline, I received a call back from the NYS hotline saying I was confirmed to have a test. I drove to the testing site with my roommate -- she was tested as well, despite her not having any symptoms. She just lives with me, so they tested her as well. This is just my experience though and they probably vary. The New York State hotline/your home state/nation's health authorities will give you the best answer.

so in a short answer to your question, you may not get an appointment from the hotline if you have no symptoms. However, if you live with someone who does/did, and you arrive to the testing site with them, they may test you as well. You can not, however, just drive up there. You **must** have an appointment to get tested. Many people got turned back from the testing site because they didn't have an appointment."

Hi! so now that the cases are now increasing in the West (where many (not all, of course, but many do) of us live I imagine) I thought this might help since I was worried sick about the idea of quarantine before it happened here. I live in Westchester County, New York, just one mile from where the first cluster in the US was and where the first containment zone happened. The entire county is in what is essentially a lockdown (stay at home order). Although many stores are closed and reasons to leave the house are few and far apart, we can still access everything essential here. My local grocery store, aside from maybe hand sanitizer, still has everything I could need. I went to a specialist doctor today for a follow up for one of my past visits, had no problem getting an appointment and being seen! I went to the pharmacy, picked up all the OTC and prescription medicines I'd need (there was also plenty of hand soap!). Super easy. We are just encouraged, highly, to stay at home. Essentially, the quarantine was what made me panic the most. Now, even living in America's hardest hit state, with 8% or so of cases worldwide just in New York State alone, I can still access everything I need without any issues. I know the concept of quarantine sounds horrifying, but I personally calmed down a lot when I realized I could still get all of my essential items even during quarantine, and I hope this helps others relax too, even if just a tiny bit. Stay home unless necessary, be kind to all essential personnel, wash your hands, and stay cautiously positive. People are working around the clock to control this for all of us. Plus, btw, Westchester County testing is aggressive, and our numbers are slowing :)

I can not speak for the hospital scene as I don't work in the medical profession, but if anyone here IS a doctor, nurse, first responder, anything at all, bless you and we appreciate your enormous sacrifice. You (as well as the grocery store workers, delivery drivers, mailmen/women, cleaning crews, etc.) are on the front lines and keeping us safe. You're all rockstars! Thank you! I hope every single day that you all receive hazard pay for your resolve and dedication."

Anxiety,fjzm85b,t3_eupik4,1583723105.0,"(Yikes! Sorry this ended up being so long. Feel free to scroll past this! Just kinda ranted/word vomitted what I found helpful.) Hey everyone! I was talking to a therapist (a friend of mine, I don't have a therapist although I sure wish I was going to therapy!) about how she has a lot of patients worrying about the virus. Her words I think were helpful.

A lot of people are worried about the sheer amount we *don't* know about this virus. The unknown is the scary part. She said that she thinks its helpful to try to look at the positives of that. Sure, we don't know exactly how this outbreak will be curtailed. Just because we don't know, doesn't mean that the unknown means we're destined for doom. For instance, during the SARS outbreak of 2003, we genuinely didn't know *ANYTHING* about it. It was the first SARS Coronavirus to spread globally. There was speculation that it could kill everyone. What ended up happening is it was contained. We had NO idea that was going to happen, but it did! Sure, this one is spreading, but that's one the few 100% established facts. Doomsday scenarios are not at all guaranteed (in fact, most medical professionals say we are *far* from it). She ultimately said if someone feels like they have to dwell on this, dwell on the positive side of it. Just because we don't know all about it, doesn't mean that it is guaranteed to be a world-ending pandemic. It might spread, but in the end surprise us. Maybe it'll mutate and kill itself off (yes! that can happen! Mutating is not automatically bad. In fact, viruses in history have mutated and quite literally mutated into a form that made it unable to sustain itself, so it dies off). So yes, while not a whole lot is certain, that also means there's *plenty of potential for us to overestimate the worries* and *let our anxiety about it run amok*. **TL;DR of this part:** as hard as it may be to cope with it being so unknown (trust me, I worry about not being in control about things all the time), the unknown is by no means an indicator that the apocalypse is coming.

Furthermore, stressing about what we can't control, such as the global state of the virus, will cause madness. Unhappy about the way your government or a foreign government has handled the virus? I feel ya. But, none of us can control that. No matter how much you despair over how China or Italy or the United States has handled it, it can't be changed. So, shifting focus to things where you have influence is key. The more you think about things you have no influence over (like government responses), the more worked up you'll get, and the more helpless you'll feel. Thinking about it (in the form of looking for news updates about this virus on social media or on places on reddit that aren't this megathread) will not make you feel better -- much worse. Odds are, if there's something extremely pertinent to you in regards to this virus, you will hear about it from someone or your local government directly. In the meantime, do what you CAN control. You don't need to go to the store and buy out all the shelves to feel fully in control. By washing your hands, carrying hand sanitizer, being cognizant of who is around you (do people look sick? are they coughing? etc.) and doing your very best to avoid crowded areas whenever possible, you are in the driver seat. You're reducing your chances of catching the virus. Good job! Canceled your trip abroad? Did you opt for an off-peak time to take public transport instead of during rush hour? Did you decide to work from home today? Nice! That's all you, you're making those decisions and you are working towards protecting yourself. That's awesome, keep doing that, YOU are in control. There are people out there working very hard on a vaccine. Soon, we'll have it. In the meantime, do your best to, while keeping the self-protection recommendations from the CDC and WHO in mind, live your life and do things you enjoy. Worrying too much can, in fact, [INCREASE your odds of getting sick](https://www.bustle.com/p/can-stress-cause-physical-illness-this-is-how-anxiety-affects-your-immune-system-7524590) , so it's in your best interests to keep your own worrying in check."

While it is *technically* safer than the areas of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts that are in the conflict zone, it is still risky. If you do decide to visit Crimea, do so at your own risk and be *extremely* careful about what you say or do in public.
