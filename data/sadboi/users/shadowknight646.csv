Except they forgot that the rest of their player base dont like the changes either. I saw a comment below as well that the way to lower jäger's pickrate is to lower the amount of stuff he's needed to counter. Buffing Ying with another Candella and two smokes is likely going to push his play rate even higher. Which, with how everything is going with the new development team, they're likely going to think that their nerfs on Jäger weren't effective and are going to do it again."

About advice, depression is different for everyone really, some things that work for some people don't for others, that's been apparent from what I've tried for myself, but maybe it'll help you out. I can't give any advice about your home situation, but maybe, just each day try to find one thing you can compliment yourself on. Whether it be something like having brushed your teeth, take pride in that, say ""Hey, I did good today, I worked up enough motivation to brush my teeth"" or try complimenting your own appearance, even though that might be hard. Friends, yeah it's hard with that, online it's a lot easier, cause for the shy people we aren't staring someone in the face, we aren't reading every bit of body language possible. Just maybe as well, try sending your irl friend a message, ask to meet up sometime or make plans, who knows you might have a lot of fun for a day. I dunno if any of this is helpful, hopefully it is for you.
