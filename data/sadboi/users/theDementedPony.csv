Sverige,fl7qate,t3_fn1cvr,1584907100.0,"Förutom vad ovanstående redan nämnt:

- om du uppvisar symtom och har en tid på hälsocentralen: ring innan och fråga ifall du ska använda en annan ingång eller dylikt, eller möjligen skjuta upp tiden helt och hållet beroende på hur brådskande ärendet är

- om du har en närstående som är inlagd på sjukhus: utse en person bland de närstående som sköter kontakten med vården/ansvarig sjuksköterska. Vi har ofta(st) väldigt späckade arbetsdagar och spenderar redan nu mer tid än önskvärt med administrativa uppgifter. Att uppdatera närstående är väldigt viktigt, men det finns väldigt få bra anledningar till att behöva uppdatera flera familjemedlemmar angående samma patient under samma arbetspass

- sök information så långt det är möjligt/rimligt online innan du tar telefonkontakt. Både 1177 och akutmottagningar har väldigt högt tryck just nu.

- ta VAB:en när ett barn blir sjukt, om din partner är sjukvårdspersonal, även om det kanske innebär en större ekonomisk smäll.

- respektera besöksförbud och/eller allmänna förhållningsregler (handsprit när du kommer till och lämnar avdelningen, t.ex.)

- hjälp oss att sprida information. Upprepa viktig information till dina nära. 

- en tårta är alltid bra för moralen!"

Nurse,ey3hc17,t3_cvdffb,1566764407.0,"Ask for help/advice as often as you need to, to feel confident that you're delivering safe and appropriate care to the patient. Try and be kind to yourself, and don't set too high standards for yourself - it's not realistic to compare oneself to a colleague with lots of experience."
prozac,ex7i1kh,t1_ex702i7,1566060633.0,"Same goes for me. My doctor wanted to try citalopram before increasing my dose to 60mg, but since I was going abroad for a funeral we decided it was better to stick to fluoxetine until my next review. Have you tried any other SSRIs? Hopefully you'll feel better soon or have better luck with an SNRI. 

I feel ambivalent about trying another medication since fluoxetine has really improved my depression. But can equally not continue living with this level of anxiety. It's a tough choice for sure."
prozac,ex5ulz0,t1_ex5g58d,1566032383.0,"For me anxiety predominantly manifests itself as heart palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain and restless legs in terms of physical symptoms. Since I upped my dose to 60mg these symptoms are more present throughout the day, and definitely worse during panic attacks. It's impossible to distinguish if this is purely the antidepressant's fault or if it's due to circumstances. I did however notice a worsening in these symptoms during my first week on 60mg, before life gave me some more lemons to deal with. Hope this makes any kind of sense."
prozac,ex1cury,t1_ex0xseu,1565939613.0,"Sounds very similar to my experience. The first week on 60mg I actually felt more anxious, and definitely a lot more irritable and tearful. I imagine that's what bad PMS would feel like. It's difficult to say if it's made me feel better or not, since I've had major negative things happening where it's only to be expected to feel more depressed and anxious. This is now week 4 (I think) on 60mg and to answer your question: I feel worse, but I don't think it's (purely) the medication's fault. Although I feel like I have more physical symptoms of my anxiety than ever before."
prozac,ewze5b5,t1_ewzd92v,1565894717.0,"Been on it since March, I think. Started off with 20mg and currently on 60mg. Been on current dose for 3 weeks ish. Talked to my doctor about it, who suggested to wait and see if it would eventually ease off a bit. It's not."
prozac,ewyp1p3,t3_cqmmtu,1565884652.0,"I can't sleep at night if I take it any later than around 9am. Started taking it absolutely last thing before falling asleep and it's worked wonders for my circadian rhythm. I now wake up a bit earlier and have less insomnia. Have had strange dreams since day one though. Not nightmares in particular, just... Weird shit. Currently on 60mg, started off with 20mg."

Anxiety,ewriuel,t3_cpsy14,1565706493.0,"See if there's any maps of the airport available online, maybe? Make sure to read through the airline's rules for carry-on luggage to avoid any hiccups in security. I've never heard anyone get yelled at, and have never got yelled at myself, during my numerous travels in Europe. Remember that most of other passengers are just as confused as you feel, hence the waiting times for security/border control/boarding."
Anxiety,ewrhx4l,t3_cpqqqd,1565705863.0,"Most side effects faded for me after around 10 days or so. Try taking it at a different time of day, or with food (if you're not already) which can help the nausea a bit. I worked around my excessive sweating by taking it before bed instead of in the morning, for example."
