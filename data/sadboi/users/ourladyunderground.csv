His ending felt somewhat rushed because we weren't necessarily shown over the course of his arc that he improved. In fact he as a character felt incredibly stagnant. Even Fen, who was supposed to be a side character, was somehow a better/more interesting character and even became a part of the main ensemble. Eliot was in the same boat for Season 4, but he was written out of it for the most part sadly. Every point of development for Quentin, at least personally, fell flat."

What is it with people being ""sapiosexuals"" like lmao, it just sounds so much more pretentious than just outright admitting you prefer getting to know the guy/girl first. And on Tinder, nonetheless, where the process to finding either a hookup or a relationship is by...swiping left or right on people's faces. So saying you're a ""sapiosexual"" kind of sends me the message that you're already being disingenuous. There's nothing wrong with preferring to look at the personality or intellect of a person but to specifically use the term ""sapiosexual"" like you're being unique is laughable asf. Sends me major r/notlikeothergirls vibes.

And the amount of shy gays on there is kinda surprising. It's a lot, not to mention the shy gays who don't initiate convos (who admit to it on their bio ofc) and you match with.
