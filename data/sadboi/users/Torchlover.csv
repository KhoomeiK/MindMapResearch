She’s young dumb and horny and seems to not be ready for a relationship, plus she’s craving for attention because of what she sent to a dude.

I caressed his body, rubbed his feet, massaged his body, cooked for him, nurtured his soul, and his mind. That wasn’t enough. Now we’re over, I just keep thinking about how he used to always say what I did for him, not what he liked about me as a person."

Have that conversation with her on why. Identity issues are huge with mixed people. Thankfully my mom is black and has given me the opportunity to be around people like me, that’ll teach me about my history and culture. I have a cousin (mom is white) isolated him from us his whole life, now he can’t stand to even look at her. That’s a big issue for all mixed families.
