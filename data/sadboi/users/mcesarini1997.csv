I suffer from the same kind of anxiety that I torture myself with overthinking and accepting a certain negative reality and the conclusions drawn from it as THE reality that I am familiar with. It’s awful and I totally understand the constant hypochondriac like stress triggers because I experience those same triggers!!! I smoke weed regularly, I’d say, the step of above daily which really probably isn’t good for me but I’ve had a psychological dependence of sorts for the past couple of years. All those tools you mentioned I will adopt and try to use going forward, I really can’t thank you enough for giving such a genuine and thought out response to just a random post on an app. Really, it means so much. I also tried taking a hot shower/bath yesterday and it did seem to relieve a lot of tension, so I will definitely give the warm object on the back of the neck a shot, as well. Again, thank you for putting anoniminity aside and really giving a personal answer, that means the world and you should know just how much you helped me. Thank you thank you."

I saw her outside today for the first time since that day. She’s clearly still using and thought about how her son must have felt through all of it. Cold, sad and not the response I’d ever hope to give because it’s very sad to watch, but unfortunately, it is true."

ShortStoriesCritique,fmf9u3z,t1_fmedso0,1586022822.0,"Thanks so much for the feedback! Same thing for me, I love telling stories to help clear my own head and let myself kind of go into the nooks and crannies of my head and get some it out. 
Do you mean the change of perspective around the lemon? Or the narrative of King Misha instead of changing to The Conjurer? 
I really appreciate your comment and would to hear more of what you thought of it, after you get your much needed sleep:)"

ShortStoriesCritique,flymz0b,t1_fly427u,1585605189.0,Thank you so much for your feedback! Very much appreciated:)
ShortStoriesCritique,flw2w3m,t3_fr0mdr,1585538252.0,"Your dialogue flows extremely well. I loved the characterization and your descriptiveness made it very easy to visualize. As the above comment said, my only problem was it got a tad repetitive at the beginning of each of the first few stanzas with “On Friday’s during Lent”, but overall I really enjoyed your writing!:)"
