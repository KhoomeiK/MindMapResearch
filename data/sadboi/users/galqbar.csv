The amount per nuclear weapon depends a great deal on the design of the weapon. Judging by the yields of most warheads (most can be set to at least 100kt) and the rule of thumb that 1kt / kg is about the maximum yield, I would guess most warheads have at least 100 kg of plutonium. In practice I wouldn’t be surprised if most weapons had double that. 

I don’t have any figures off the top of my head for the total amount of plutonium sitting around, but if you check page 9 of http://fissilematerials.org/library/gfmr15.pdf you can see that there are currently about 15,000 nuclear weapons and used to be more than 60,000."
