It takes its toll on our souls especially when they are parents, and finding that connection again through virtual or physical means can mean coping and healing.  It's been a hard time for so many people, and those of us who have depression or some other mental affliction, the world almost seems like it's falling in on itself and there isn't any hope. I think that's how it was for my dad. He was dependent on failing medication, and our government did not  help him like they promised after serving in the military. Sometimes I guess the world becomes too much to bear. I am sorry for your loss, and know I totally understand how you feel about playing games that your mom loved.

Set up trail cams and follow their trail back. Get your farm friends to help you set up traps around the den holes and smoke them out. You clear an entire den in no time at all. If you think they are hard to hunt you clearly arent a hunter. Not that I have anything to prove to you so you can save your pride and petty show for someone else. Deuces.

I've seen coyotes range from 40-80 pounds up here in Washington. An average max weight is not a definite max weight. Especially if you got coyotes in your area interbreeding with domestic dogs, which they do. Coyotes get along best with Labradors I know from experience.  Labradors get up to 65 to 80, and if they are part coyote then you got yourself a bigger coyote or a smaller labrador haha. Many coyotes these days are mix breeds anyway. If they interbreed with a wolf, then you got a pack of wolf/coyote hybrids that are much bigger than the average coyote."

There are still a few of us but not nearly as many as there were. They've replaced it with art deco and paper and plastic crap that disappears or loses its value quickly. They consume our livelihoods with machines that punch out thousands of the same blade, and lacking character. The industrial revolution along with capitalism and civilization were all run by criminals and enforced by criminals in the 1800s. Civilization became a thing forced upon the people who loved their nature and the open plains. Then if that wasn't enough when they enacted the same colonization BS the british did upon their own people the people became slaves to the machines they worked. Paid next to nothing only enough to sometimes have a roof over their head and a piece of bread and cheese a day. The world was a lot healthier without industrial movement and civilization. Especially when civilization means plumes of black smoke and poverty stricken peoples who didn't want to be apart of a revolution. but all this coal and plastic waste is good for the collective us right? BUT if we are forced to live in such a state then finding equal means of living should be priority not just bare minimum survival until we die."

My prediction is a lot more suicides would occur at first. Then after that deniers will pop up similar to how flat earthers still exist.

Then scientists will try to find a way where we can actively perceive the other side of things. Then studies will be there to ask if god is real, because as we all know that's what is on everyones mind when they think of ghosts, if ghosts are real then we have to be sure this too is real.

Then further contact will be made, and then we will try using it to our benefit and living with ghosts after that.

Humans will never change, our curiosity will continue to grow until we can no longer discover anything or until we destroy ourselves.

and those who are afraid of change and curiosity will continue to reject anything proven."
RagnarokNetflix,fienwnx,t1_fh287hz,1582380821.0,"But Magni and Modi Thors sons were born of the giantess Jarnsaxa but in this Saxa were Vidars daughter, at least that is how she is portrayed."
RagnarokNetflix,fienshh,t1_fh1ptwm,1582380783.0,well I commend them getting the mythos as right as they did. I can't blame them for changing some of it up for creative licensing and the fact that Thors children didn't have a lot of their story survive after Christianities conversions.
RagnarokNetflix,fienfbi,t1_fgh40al,1582380667.0,I have to wonder if they changed up the lore just a smidge since the mythology of Magni and Modi are ultimately lacking and just made Magne and Laurits the reincarnation of Thor and Loki. Even though they died in Ragnarok.
RagnarokNetflix,fiedfwv,t3_exxbfw,1582377798.0,"Technically the lore of the show supposedly comes after Ragnarok. The end of the world War came and went and was reborn after a disastrous battle.  Where all the giants and gods died except for a few. Magne or Magni however you want to spell it and his brother Modi (they are sons of Thor and a Jotunn ((giant)) Jarnsaxa, name sound familiar? )  survived Ragnarok along with Baldr, Hod, Hoenir, Njord, Vidar, and the daughter of Sol (who to be honest I believe to be Iman because her presence while downplayed as a side character who offers Magne encouragement, with season 2 I feel like she may have a greater presence as a fellow God) . Vidar is the son of Odin and the giantess Gridr. Jord or Fjorn in this case fell in love with a witch with a similar name to his own grandmother, who happens to be Gry in this case. The thing with Magni however, viking lore shows that Magni is the name for the SONS of Thor who take up arms in his name, as mortals but the seeress (the cashier) unlocks their genetic heritage to become heroes. Honestly the show is pretty accurate to mythology aside from a few discrepancies that  were missing from history due to destroyed documents, or simply the lack of continued story keeping over the years and conversion to Christianity. Magni is truly a son of Thor and a giantess... Just long down the line, which is why his immediate father kept runes and held onto those traditions of his own heritage. Because he knew what he was but was killed by Vidar before he had the chance to fight back. I just wish there was more hammering in this show because Magni inherited Thors Hammer and Sleipnir after  Hrungnir's death and landed down on Thors neck pinning him and preventing him from moving. Magni but three days old single handedly lifted  Hrungnir's arm off of his father when everyone else failed to do so. Odin was angered but it was within Thors right to pass it down to his son despite being half giant. Lauritz would have the same genetics as Magne but perhaps not the same spirit. Maybe takes after his spiritual Uncle Loki, but long story short no he is not Loki since Loki is dead along with his brother, but comparably he is definitely the Loki to his Thor in terms of personality though more likely, if continuing the trend of being accurate with lore, he may be Magnis brother Modi who in mythology did not have as much limelight as his brother, but was definitely present during Ragnarok fighting along side him. The show may have given him a personality similar to Loki's because of Thors and Loki's relationship as siblings.  I hope that clears up a little. Side note: Ragnarok was believed to be the end of the end. However what the vikings did not know, that after a war torn world life finds a way. Though the time of Gods was over for the most part.

Side side note: If the Saxa in the show is the giant Jarnsaxa... that means Magne and her are related.

&#x200B;

Side Side Side note: Vidar was considered to be the strongest among all the gods/giants... Of course until Magni came around. Vidar was even stronger than Thor, who was considered stronger than even his father Odin."
