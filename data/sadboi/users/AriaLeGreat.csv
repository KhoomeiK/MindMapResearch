therapy,f4z0v1z,t1_f4vul6h,1571890770.0,"Yeah...

 I've tried to talk to others about coping with loneliness, and they also tell me that I have to start by accepting the fact everyone feels lonely from time to time. As a social species, I understand it's only human nature... 

Im also trying not to withdraw from relationships, but a lot of the time the interactions and bond building just feels so superficial... I can't articulate this specific feeling, but it's almost as if I feel im lying to everyone all the time because I feel lonely even with the ones I care about."
depression,f4wpxpb,t3_dm474q,1571858728.0,"For me it's like treading water. Day after day just with your mouth barely breaking through the surface. The rest of you submerged. 

You can see other people on the shore. You can see other people swimming around. But not you. You're stuck in place. You can't swim. You're just barely surviving. 

And after so long your body can't take it anymore. It hurts. It burns. It's agony. 

Until finally you start to sink. And then you start to drown."

But these days I'm an honest, selfless, very brave bitch. You don't know HALF of the shit I've been through. And I could give less of a shit if you care.

I was honestly not intending to get this in depth with someone as blind sighted as you, because you clearly are the kind of person to do whatever the fuck you want and deal with shit afterwards regardless of who it might affect other than yourself. 

Do I really have to explain to you why you don't get to use gay sex as an excuse to have penile-vaginal intercourse? Anal, doesn't fall under the whole procreation thing you do realize, right? ""God yall oldies are just boring fucks. I'mma go stick whatever I want up my pussy and yall can't say shit about it. If I get preggers oh well. Just gotta coat hanger that shit lol If I get AIDS oh well. Yolo bitch"" Lmao this is how you're coming across. Seriously. Selfish and reckless. You can probably barely afford all the abortions you're probably gonna need. Have sex if you fucking want cause yea shit feels nice af. But it's an act for adults because it has real consequences when done sloppily. Case in point: you. Grow the fuck up."
offmychest,f4vwwrn,t1_f4vrun2,1571848971.0,"Yeah sex feels good. My body count is higher than yours I promise and I'm not proud of it in the least. So I fucking get it. But pregnancy is literally why sex exists. In an evolutionary sense. That's why it's not ""moral"" but smart to wait until you're with someone you're ready to accept the consequences with. Nobody ever said wait til marriage. Not even til you're willing to raise a child. I'm not Christian or Catholic or even minutely conservative. But I do believe in accountability. You have none.

Now I'm glad to be rude since you're gonna go ahead and be a bitch simply because you're the hoe that got preggers and I'm being straight up w you. Go on and do your fetus deletus hun. Believe it or not I wasn't speaking out of hostility or malintent, I was actually speaking from experience, cause just like you I fucked around and paid the price. Not money. I work FT so 600 is nothing. But there's more to it than that. I fucked up a lot ages 14-19 bc I didn't have mommy supporting me financially. I grew up real fucking fast. Hope you eventually do to."

Im sorry if it seems like I'm coming across rude or preachy, but if you're not even enough of an adult to understand that BC is not enough protection ESPECIALLY if he's not pulling out, and you're so childish you can't even tell the woman who's foolishly still financially supporting you that you're pregnant, you should not be having sex at all. You made the decision to fuck. No matter how many precautions are taken, there's ALWAYS a chance for pregnancy. You made the choice. You take responsibility."

Secondly, if you're disappointed, it means you had expectations that were not met. If this is a common trend, sometimes the best thing to do is to realize you're setting yourself up to be let down. 

It's easy to let yourself fall into an upset state of mind when you allow things out of your control to infect your mind and fester. It'll affect a lot of aspects of your life if you hold onto what you cannot control. 

All you can do is your best. Maybe reach out to them? Don't mention your b'day, but ask how they're doing? And try not to expect they'll reciprocate the care. 

It's not fair to expect yourself from others. Not everyone is as selfless as you. Some are inherently slightly more self interested than others. Some have a lot on their plate. 

Try not to feel too down on your big day (:"
offmychest,f4pcpj4,t3_dld9ny,1571724161.0,"Personally I don't think you're okay w being alone. And I think you know youre not okay w being alone. Stemming from the I guess at the end there and the word ""lonely"". 

Personally I'd been lonely for ten years. But nobody around me besides the ones that know me most would even suspect. I smiled and acted confident and charismatic but inside I hated myself and sometimes projected that hatred onto everyone around me. I had nobody I could call a friend. I didn't REALLY talk to ""friends"" or family. And it was my own internal hell. 

Loneliness, leads to depression, depression leads to isolation (inwardly or outwardly) or desocialization, leading you back to loneliness. 

You need to break the cycle before you end up digging your self into a place you can't even see the top of. 

Force yourself out of your comfort zone just a little bit at a time. Some days maybe not at all. But you have to try. 

Go out of your way to find people you TRULY enjoy. Even just one or two. 

Practice makes perfect. I had to learn how to socialize from books and videos lol sounds pathetic but literally have never studied harder in my life at anything, and it paid off. 

Best of luck."
