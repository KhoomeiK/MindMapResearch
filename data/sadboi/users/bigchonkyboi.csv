narcissisticparents,f7coiea,t1_f6jpvdu,1573596657.0,"Wow that’s just terrible. My situation can’t even compare to yours. So sorry you have to deal with this. I am currently living with my mum and we have blocked him on all social media. We also have a dog but he’s registered under her name so we won’t be sharing him anymore. My father wants to feel like a 20 year old again. That’s why he hangs out with young adults, is marrying one, and is drinking and drugging himself to death. I feel more sorry for my mum though. Her mother was a narcissist too. So after years of mental trauma she married a few men that she thought loved her when really she just got raped, abused, and severely fucked over. Neither one of us really trust men. Money’s a bit tight right now but we are getting by just fine. I really hope that you can cut your parents off for good soon. Best wishes"
narcissisticparents,f7cnpzi,t1_f6d4z2e,1573596189.0,That sounds way worse than my situation. I’m really sorry to hear that. All I can really tell you is to stay strong my dood.
narcissisticparents,f6cjrbi,t3_dqrds6,1572786216.0,"My Narcissistic Father started taking away my phone every night after he and his fiancé were keeping me awake all night by having extremely loud sex, WHEN MY FRIEND WAS SLEEPING OVER WITH ME IN THE ROOM RIGHT NEXT TO HIS. I texted him at 1 AM in the morning asking him to politely keep it quiet, and he had the AUDACITY, to tell ME that I was making HIM feel uncomfortable. So months later I got kicked out for being ‘disrespectful’ and not being the perfect little maid that he always wanted."
narcissisticparents,f6cgd15,t3_dqssal,1572785435.0,"My father is a huge narcissist. Even though it hasn’t escalated to physical abuse, the mental is still kinda bad. Don’t wanna compare other people’s situations with mine because i’m sure theirs are probably much worse. He kicked me out of his house because I was ‘disrespectful’ for standing up to him and calling him out on all of his behaviour. Keep in mind, i’m still a literal teenager. He made it very clear that he didn’t want me back in his house again. I still get messages though, saying that he loves and misses me. Bullshit. He just wants me as a baby sitter and cleaner for his alcoholic fiancé and unfortunately her angel children. At least he found someone who can drink as much as him."
