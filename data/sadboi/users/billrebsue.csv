Whenever we do not mow to his liking he takes it upon himself to mow half of our front lawn.  We have a privacy fence around the rest of our house or I'm sure he would do it to the back yard as well.  Well it keeps happening we keep ignoring....  Well now our house is up for sale (partially because we can't stand the neighbors...............) and will be closing on our new home in 30 days.  So I ask what would you do?  He did it again TODAY.. I live in Michigan, there is literally no need for our lawn to be mowed at all it's short and it was fine.  I want to file a police report since were moving and I am just so flippin done with this dude.  Husband wants me to drop it since were moving.

US prisons are just slums to hold someone in and give them the most minimum to no help.  Corrections will spend more money on changing their electronic systems rather than fix the molded building, the asbestos, the lack of activities, the lack of learning opportunities.  It's astounding that they are more comfortable keeping a person locked in their bunk or cell instead of learning what that individual might need to become better in society."

(Also to add my husband dated my cousin for 3 years in high school)  Well she got tired of it...  planned a huge canoe trip with a bunch of mutual friends (small town).  He offered to help paddle my other cousin and I's canoe for the trip.  (I will add I have known him my entire life, once again small town).  We talked and drank and laughed the entire trip together had an absolute blast and had a lot in common.  Hooked up that night ;) The next day we did another river run but on tubes.  Once again absolute BLAST chatting away.  Spend the night again with him and in the morning he asks for my number, takes me to town to my car and we don't talk for the rest of the day.  Next day rolls around he texts me to see what I am doing that night.  Go over to his place and we go out to dinner and just have a good time after he gets out of work.  Do the same thing the next few nights.  6 days later I am moved in and we have never separated taken a break nothing.  Its been almost 9 1/2 years now and we grow stronger and better every day.  We truly live life to the fullest.  Even with our weird history it just seems like it was all meant to play out the way it did because it forced us to have amazing communication skills."

Sometimes their so lucid that it feels like it really happened.  I was on Celexa recently for it... The ""rewind repeats"" as I call them finally stopped but it came with a host of more problems so I had to wean myself off of it.  It was seriously an amazing 2 months of not making things up and replaying minuscule doesn't even matter conversations.  Kinda like I finally didn't care what people thought of me it was great.  Buttttttt the insomnia and full blown depression it gave me was harder to deal with than dealing with my brain not shutting up about fake things."

I was lucky my husband is supportive and knew this was going to be extremely difficult for me.  I brought books to pass the time and lived for Amazon Prime, anything to distract me when I had down time.  As for being away hubby sent me pictures of our dogs every morning and night we faced time together.  Face time I think is by far a better option than text or phone because actually seeing him and my dogs made me feel not so far away from them.  But really the main tip is staying BUSY!!

A lot of the time he takes freezer burritos and wraps them in aluminum foil (not sure if you do the low carb wraps).
