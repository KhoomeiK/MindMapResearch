Powder products don’t typically expire the same way liquids or creams do. They usually just lose their pigmentation due to how the pigment binders break down over time.

I try not to bring purses or backpacks into stores anymore, just a wallet in my pocket. I also avoid self checkout. When I was desperately hungry/poor I felt less bad about lifting food but I would also lift makeup even though I have so much because I felt out of control. Never resold stuff but I gave a lot of makeup away that I didn’t need & was stupid enough to grab. Thankfully I have my school’s food pantry & housemates who buy food for everyone so I have food security now. 

Brainstorm on what made it easier for you in the past to keep that habit / lift. If there’s a bag you’d always use, give it away. If you had any devices to remove tags, toss them. Have friends that lift? Don’t go into stores with them. Aisles that you always swooped from? Buy those products online. 

I hope those things help you not fall back into old habits! It really helped me avoid any desires to lift!"

From there you can start to branch out. Maybe you want to do gradients in the coloring book instead of solid colors, or change some of the colors in your embroidery pattern, or try adding different spices!

Pinterest is full of step by step instructions for basically everything! You can follow those crafting tutorials to a T or modify them with different paint / add glitter / whatever. 

Reading fantasy books or engaging in non fiction can be helpful too. Visualize your favorite book characters, draw them how you think they would look in real life, write short stories about them. You can also do all of that in your head
