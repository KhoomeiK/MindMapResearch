SuicideWatch,fr5bu17,t3_gmmxuz,1589905968.0,"I don’t remember ever being happy. 
My parents were never together, I’m a baby out of a friends w benefits type situation. There may have been love involved but not the kind parents have for each other. I spent most of my life with my mother in Germany, and the summers with my father in Puerto Rico. 

They’re both addicts. Alcohol and heroin. However my father died of heroin use July 27th 2018. And my mother is now a recovered alcoholic who is raising my brother fairly better than she did with the rest of us. 

When I was 12 I realized I hated my body. Because it wasn’t even mine. People were using it however they pleased, and criticizing my body. It didn’t belong to me, I didn’t have any say in what was happening. So I ate and ate and ate until I was ugly and untouchable. So I could stop being hurt and just be fat and ugly. 

When I was 13 I must’ve weighed 180lbs. Maybe 170. Another reason to hate my body as dating became active in my friend group. I felt disgusting, worthless, and no one was telling me otherwise. 
I didn’t have my first kiss until I was 18. Nor did I have sex until I was 21. So so naturally I wanted to be the opposite of what I was, skinny and pretty. I stopped eating, and when I did eat I made myself vomit. It’s a cycle I still do and struggle with today. And I’m still not skinny and pretty. 

I don’t share about much when it comes to suicide because no one tends to care. But when I was 13, almost 14 I swallowed 80 or so extra strength Tylenol. No one told me it wouldn’t work in the millions of google searches I’d done on how to kill myself. I threw up almost immediately (probably 25 minutes later?..) and then I was in the back of an ambulance eating charcoal. I returned home from the hospital in about three days. All they did was a psych evaluation. 

The year before I left Germany and my mother, I was 15 and it was a little after my birthday (6/12). I spent hours debating I was sure I was going to do it. But I couldn’t. I couldn’t kill myself. So I told my mother I wanted to die. She drove me to the er, but her only words on the way were “please don’t ruin Christmas”. 

I left for the spring semester that year. Sometime in March. And I finished my year 10, 11, and 12, alone in America in a boarding school. I lived in the dorms, quite like university honestly. Nothing special. But it wasn’t in an unloving environment. However my mother came to join me in America, some siblings included (just two of them out of eight, as they’re all grown now) 

My senior year (I was 18)  I tried again. I ended up in the psychiatric hospital for three months. And they diagnosed me and set me up with a therapist and psychiatrist. Everything. It didn’t work. 

My first year of college (19) I was dating my high school sweetheart of almost two years already we can call him shithead bc that’s what he is. He treated me poorly in hindsight (which is always 2020 btw). He wouldn’t understand how I felt or why. Rarely told me how he felt other than when he’d argue that I “should know he loves me because he’s still with me”. Alone in my college dorm, a floor away from my best friend Lexus (I’ll use real names bc I’m not a pussy), I tried again. My third suicide attempt. I told Lexus in a daze that I was struggling. And she sent an ambulance to the school and the RAs knocked on my door. I couldn’t move, they were around me quickly and I was carried off. 

In the morning my mother picked me up, asked me if I was “going to be okay” and dropped me off back at school. Shithead went to class. Texted me “wya” and my mother called him. He came. Didn’t say much. Asked me if I wanted him to stay with me. But I just said no. I didnt want to ask or beg for someone to care about me. I’d already spent my whole life doing that. I was so shattered. No one cared. No one cared that i wanted to die. 

My second year of college (19-20), shithead graduated high school and we both moved to Boston. He dormed at his school and I got an apartment. We fought constantly. He cheated and lied and reinforced just how worthless and undeserving of love I felt. Over and over I begged him to stop hurting me. He never ever did. 

June 2018 we moved in together. I was paying more rent and bills than him. I was working more, so in result I dropped out of college. I was too stressed and depressed to do everything. So I chose money and work to keep him happy. At this job I met some incredible people, even for just being a shitty job at CVS. Two of which became my best friend, Nicole, and my current boyfriend whomst idk is ok to name in this. Hm. We can just call him Bug. 

In October 2018 (21 years old, almost 22) I left shithead. My Bug and Nicole helped move me out. And cared for me in that time. 

In this healing time I stopped eating almost entirely. I went from 235lbs to around 170 in 3 or 4 months. Probably 4. No one around me noticed or cared. The numbers didn’t seem to effect my body. Some people at work commented but it just. Wasn’t enough. I needed someone to either worry about me or find me pretty. 
My boyfriend now, but just best friend then, we started dating 1/1/2019. He liked my weight loss and made it obvious. That’s how people are. They like pretty skinny people. And I don’t blame him. 

Nicole and I became toxic for eachother and we moved apart in November 2019. 

(I’m now 22 years old) 
I’ve been living with a roommate, rainbow (yes that’s her real name) but since quarantine I haven’t seen her. Unfortunately I experienced something very heavy and traumatic this past March before covid hit. I was pregnant. Very pregnant. 22 weeks. And I made a decision I think about everyday, and frankly regret. 

I am swallowed by regret and shame and hate for myself. Not just for one reason or another, for everything. I no longer want to be alive. I’ve felt this way since I can always remember. I’ve never wanted to exist. I cry and cry and cry, I mean every fucking day dude. 

I don’t know I don’t know how to help you but I want to. God I don’t know what to say. Imagine not hearing your new favourite song, you’re dead and you’d have never known how lovely this song is and how much it makes you feel. Imagine a movie with your favourite actors, a book from your favourite death author finally published, the cat or dog or lizard that you will have in the future, your room in your first dorm or apartment, those plants in the windowsill you don’t water but still live somehow? Now imagine your school finding out you died. Your friends. Your parents. Your pediatrician and dentist. Reddit, and me. We are all we have. People. There are millions of shitty people, but there are millions of good in spite. Life is not easy, nor is it forgiving. But it’s worth living. Somehow someway. Not the way you’re living, nor I, but there is a good version of the lives we’re living. And it’s still us living that life, we just have to figure out how. Not figure out how to end it. Life is made to be lived. Pain must be felt, much more for some than others. 

But god. It’s going to be worth it. If I can tell you my entire life story and sit here and tell you to keep living even though I don’t want to then you have to know it’s worth it. You have to know I’m still here for a reason. It’s love, it’s knowledge, it’s independence, hope. It’s all out there. I’m 22 and I’m still desperately searching and digging for myself and how to be alive and happy. I’m 22! You’re 13! You have so much time. Please don’t throw it away. You haven’t seen half of what the world can give you, and I promise it’s better than now. Everything is always better than the moment you’re in and you will always see that as you grow. Life is not linear and neither are we. But I have full faith that it’s for reason, we are for a reason. I hope you choose to stay. And I know one day it will make sense and it will stop hurting. New hurt will come but it is nothing compared to the younger years. Believe me I understand that."

BPD,fr4848b,t1_fr3vs2p,1589879200.0,"Thanks for understanding. A lot of people have upvoted but guess the self diagnoses are downvoting. 
Idk. Whatever. People who actually have bpd will never be taken serious and treated properly because these teenagers and bullshit people are claiming to have a disorder they read the symptoms about and thought “ooooh me” 
But it’s not. It’s not a fucking tag urself meme. It’s reality. And very few fucking people know how this disorder feels and I’m sick and tired of sharing my resources with people who don’t need it. 

Again. It’s whatever. People suck. Can’t fix em. I’ll work on myself for eternity only to get barely one step ahead of my problems. But these people can post on tiktok or whatever about how they cut themselves one time in 7th grade or how they always cry when their mom yells. And people fucking congratulate them and pity them. 

Never once have I posted on social media about how much I want to kill myself every fucking day. It’s fine. It’s fine. 

Ok I’m getting mad about this so I gotta go but. Thanks again for understanding."
BPD,fr1gt65,t1_fqzw7t5,1589819471.0,"Me too I remember just sitting there thinking “I’m not broken beyond repair, other people know how this feels” it was so relieving even if I am still digging my way through recovery. 
It’s crazy to even imagine someone feels how we feel. And it’s painful to think about too."
BPD,fr1gmnl,t3_glts1h,1589819381.0,"I think it’s necessary not important. Especially because this isn’t something people under 18 can claim at all in the DSM. And if you think self diagnosing is okay, especially as a minor, and with BPD specifically, I disagree wholeheartedly. 

I don’t like when people claim to have disorders that I’m dying from. And yes. People with bpd are surviving and recovering. People die from bpd every year. I’m tired of hearing the word suicide. I want to hear “she died from depression” or bpd or anorexia. I want to hear people saying the truth. And I want people who claim these disorders without even experiencing them to fuck off. 

It’s not quirky. It’s not fun. It’s reality.

Shitty professionals who misdiagnose and shitty countries/states where you can’t afford or get healthcare are valid reasons for being undiagnosed, waiting, or suffering with a self diagnosis. Anything past that is not valid nor real. 

I don’t want to argue, I want my comment and opinion heard. I will not respond to anyone because I’m not interested in any negativity. But I feel like no one is screaming loud enough about this shit. 

Appropriating mental illness, race, sexuality, etc is not okay. And they fact people do it so often is so pathetic and disgusting. It leaves no room for real people. It leaves no room for individuality. 

Anyway. I’m tired. Thank you."

BPDPartners,fqtj48y,t1_fqth1uf,1589640015.0,"I want to add that isolation is a coping mechanism for quiets when we feel like we’d otherwise be burdening you. Sometimes I cry in my room alone while my partner sits on the couch. Sometimes he notices and sometimes not. I always want him to, because I want someone to help me. But I never want him to find me either because he deserves to not have to deal with me. 

And I know that’s hard to conceptualize when you’re not borderline, but that’s the best I can explain the thinking pattern. Sorry :/"
BPDPartners,fqtix6i,t1_fqth1uf,1589639905.0,"I spent 20 years repressing and suppressing my emotions and hurting myself in millions of ways behind closed doors. I know what she is doing. She is doing what she thinks she deserves, she doesn’t know any better. And I understand. And she’s not a bad person for it. She’s hurting a lot. And when I say this I mean it, she does not blame you in any way shape or form. And when she notices that her upsetness, upsets you, she probably is consumed with guilt. 

She would never ever want you to feel how she feels ever. Never. 

The best advice I have to get someone to get help is to reassure them that you’ll be there the whole time. You’re not going anywhere and therapy is to help you two grow together. And fall in love even more and more. Make sure she knows you’re suggesting it for her health, not for your benefit. Try not to make it about you at all in the moment, that will probably directly translate to her thinking she is a burden. (But therapy with always benefit you of course)

Just. Be there, but if you’re tired or can’t be there for the long haul, and I mean this for everyone dating a borderline. 
If you aren’t going to stick through the worst, don’t stay. You’re going to hurt that borderline worse the longer you do. 

But I think you can handle it. And I think that your love is very obvious. And I know she must struggle to believe in it sometimes, but I think you’re doing a great job."
BPDPartners,fqtees7,t3_gktmy4,1589637309.0,"Hi! I am quiet bpd too!

What I’m hearing is that she is easily disappointed and very hard on herself in her head. Not your fault at all. 

I hate when plans change or when my ideas are shot down, I get very very emotional and very personally attacked. However, I do not mope in those circumstances. And I think your partner is having a harder time than just regular bpd episodes. I think this quarantine has caused a lot of borderlines to slip into their depression extra. 

If she’s not seeing someone, please get her too ASAP. 
Borderlines are not functional 90% of the time without a therapist active in their life. 

None of this is your fault. You cannot walk on eggshells or do whatever she wants. She has to work on how she expresses and uses her emotions. She can feel them but she can do much more productive things with those emotions. 

But again. She can’t learn how alone."

Mindfulness is my second. 
But having bpd and not going to therapy is impossible. I seriously don’t see a way for someone to recover from this disorder without help. 

Like you said, you don’t know how. And you can’t trust yourself. 

If you want to practice dbt because maybe therapy isn’t an option, which should be the only reason someone with bpd doesn’t go to therapy, the. I suggest getting a workbook! If you don’t have the resources/financial ability I’d honestly be happy to get it for you. 

I hate hate hate that you’re struggling right now. And I understand completely. 

The best way to practice mindfulness is to get real with yourself. Look at the facts. 
If their is no evidence to support your emotions/reaction, then you know you have to do whatever it is you do to cope and not split. 
If there evidence and proof that validates your emotions/reaction, then stand your ground. Be emotional. Feel and express. You’re not to be made to feel like a monster when someone is truly in the wrong. And I hope determining this gets easier for you in time. You deserve to feel secure and safe especially by yourself. 

An app called The Dime Game actually is very helpful and I suggest everybody download it. Please check it out.

I have struggled for years and years with wanting to live, and it was people like Connor that made me feel confused about that. People who’ve been given obstacles, but refuse to stop pushing. He’s an inspiration. The world suffered an immense loss the day he passed. 

When we heard that his open heart surgery had failed, the morning after his passing on the PA system, we experienced a new form of unity I do not believe any of us in that school had felt before. Not in my temple, not in my friend group, not even at home have I ever felt so connected in such deep and painful grief and sorrow. There was no desire to do anything besides talk about him. And cry. So much crying. We held eachother in the atrium for hours. 

We memorialized a true legacy on our campus with a granite bench by the bus loop. And there is a fundraising walk in his name every year. As well as a scholarship in his name now. 

I think about him time to time and it still hits me the same. Goosebumps, a lump in the throat, and stinging eyes. I know everyone from my school must feel the same. I hope they do. 

May he rest in eternal happiness and peace."

BPDmemes,fq2rblj,t1_fq2q7lj,1589058879.0,It would be super triggering for people with EDs.
Fibromyalgia,fq1jg7d,t1_fq1gpbg,1589046195.0,Uh second that. Why do doctors love to make you feel like shit???? Will do. I’ll write literally everything. Bless you guys for helping.
Fibromyalgia,fq1j98u,t1_fq1fzix,1589046143.0,Yeah it’s been a huge issue for almost three years now. Just brain fog and fatigue and pain. But recently it seems there’s more and more things going wrong. Does that make sense or do you think fibros onset is shorter? In your experience!
Fibromyalgia,fq1dfv5,t1_fq1d5ds,1589044646.0,This was so helpful and relaxing thank you so much
EDAnonymous,fq17a7m,t1_fcjbdj4,1589042749.0,Yeah I can only to the cacao dude.
EDAnonymous,fq16wsh,t3_fd8c2h,1589042589.0,Any word on it? I’m in a lot of pain today in the same area. It even woke me up. I have eaten probably 300 calories a day for a few days. Idk what it is. But I’m in pain like never before.

abortion,fpwuxjs,t3_gfmlu4,1588970431.0,"Is it him or everything? I don’t feel that way at all toward my bf. No need to separate from him. I think when you feel that, that’s resentment. And with a situation so serious as this, if you resent him it’s likely to last. You’re grieving, if your mind blames him at all, you should seek therapy if you wish to keep things happy and healthy together. 

Abortions breed a lot of emotion. I absolutely did not want to have mine. 110%. But my boyfriend was not ready and the situation wasn’t good. However I don’t blame him nor feel resentment. Because of his intentions and how he helped me through the process itself. 

Even if you were relieved by the abortion, it’s possible to grieve and even feel guilt or shame. I feel all of those things. But what isn’t good or normal is when you start to feel alone and like you can’t trust anyone or can’t explain how you feel to anyone. Even your lover. Your resentment can be the end of a relationship and sometimes that is what’s meant to happen. But you have to really work at it with a professional or at least with him. You can’t let it fester not accept it. 

I wish so much happiness to you. Be safe."
BPDPartners,fpw5bvp,t1_fpw49ud,1588957520.0,"Hey. I know. And I love everything you do for him. Even posting this shows me how much you’d rather scour for a solution rather than leave him. I know this is the hardest thing for you. I completely understand. 

Me and my ex dated for 3 years. And I wish he was like you instead. My current partner is a fantastically different person than my ex. Much like you. Someone who is not put off by this disorder, someone who looks at it and says “ok, well I still love you so let’s figure it out” instead of “I love you stop being so fucked up” 

I wish your husband could see that. Because honestly. There are not many people like you or my boyfriend. Not many people able to help us carry this weight. And to mistreat you is the biggest mistake I could ever imagine. And I mean that. I hope you take my worlds wholeheartedly. 

Loving someone with bpd is signing up for a lifetime of inconsistency and chaos. And yet you’re still here! He just. It’s not that he doesn’t deserve it as a person, but he doesn’t deserve you right now. He right now, the person he is and is acting like, does not deserve you. 

Again if I may be honest, bpd does not excuse cheating and I wish you took that as a reason enough to leave and it hurts me to see you haven’t. That is a very real reason to leave. And no amount of crying apologizing begging or bpd excuses should’ve made you stay. 

You cannot save him. You are not responsible for his actions and nothing he does is in reflection of who you are. He is in control of himself. Even if we feel as though we are out of control. After the episode we know what’s right and wrong. And the self aware people with bpd also know that we are not fit to ever be not seeking help and guidance professionally. He is willingly hurting you with his disorder at this point. He knows he needs therapy, he’s been before. And he knows he’s killing you. 

Please love yourself more than this."
BPDPartners,fpw37tz,t1_fpw2l5a,1588956475.0,"I apologize for insinuating something more and unseen. My ex used to laugh at me or not speak to me when I cried. And he’d cheat and lie and hit me. 

He discovered post breakup he had aspd/sociopathic tendencies. 

You can have bpd and many other things. I think he needs help. A lot of it. And specifically for whatever is unseen and causing his apathy. 

I hope you find peace. I’m so sorry."
BPDPartners,fpw304u,t1_fpw2l5a,1588956369.0,"I think something else is there. I think bpd is a lot of terrible things but apathy is barely one. Unless he has split on you entirely. 

I know cheating comes easy because of a lot of reasons, but I have bpd and ive never cheated and rarely lie. Because I know it’s bad. If that makes sense. And because I’ve gotten A LOT of help. Which we all desperately need and deserve. 

If he’s lost all drive for therapy, and all empathy for you, I cannot imagine what you could do other than leave. You deserve happiness and safety."
BPDPartners,fpw2sul,t1_fpw2l5a,1588956268.0,"I definitely get what you mean. And I want you to post here. But I think you need even more support than just us. Because he sounds very very hurtful and apathetic. 

Also, people with BPD likely need lifelong therapy. And I’m very very certain on that. I’m terribly terribly sorry he stopped going. I wish I could help convince him to. I can’t believe how much he is okay with hurting you. That breaks my entire heart."
BPDPartners,fpw2720,t3_gfly3p,1588955969.0,"You’re in the wrong sub. There’s a lot more wrong with him than BPD. 

There are many many liars and cheaters in this community, but laughing at you and hitting you is not something I see in this disorder. I don’t think bpd is the issue. It maybe be a catalyst but something is seriously wrong with him."
BPD,fpsvedr,t3_gfb7e9,1588880268.0,It’s only manipulation if you tell them it means more than it does

Miscarriage,fprpp17,t3_gf1z2e,1588859579.0,"My baby would’ve been born around the same time as my boyfriend. Different circumstances than you I’m certain, but I think about it a lot as it approaches. My coworker was the same week’s gestation as me and when she gives birth I know it’s going to hurt."
BPD,fprowe8,t3_gf28wk,1588859122.0,Yeah I don’t know what I look like ever. Everytime I look in the mirror or see a picture I legitimately don’t understand or recognize myself. And that’s on dysphoria babes

selfimprovement,fpljfx9,t1_fplj7ps,1588713796.0,"I have a tendency to assume people’s emotions or thoughts and they are often negative so I’ll give you that. I’m following that much. 

I don’t want to blame people around me for their listening skills o just think it’s me. 

It’s mostly my significant other or friends. Sometimes family. I just y’all and somewhere along the line I wish I had stopped. Sometimes so much I choke back tears when I realise I was talking a long time."
selfimprovement,fplfz17,t1_fplfm3x,1588712019.0,Just feels like people lose interest quickly. Im not autistic (I say this bc my brother is and I know the diff between someone who don’t know when to shut up fr and someone like me) I know when people stop caring. I just can’t seem to stop. And then I get embarrassed.
selfimprovement,fplbdho,t1_fplb0pw,1588709686.0,I feel like that’ll probably work bc theyre not really listening anyway. They won’t really hear me stop lmao. I guess you’re right.
selfimprovement,fplaxe4,t1_fplau6c,1588709455.0,I know what you mean. I guess I should be specific. It’s not in public. It’s just I talk way too fucking much to the people immediate to me. But still. I am willing to share the trait lmfao

Your passion is everything, can’t wait to see what else you accomplish."
abortion,fpkbwad,t1_fpkblhn,1588691853.0,Do not tell women what to do. Your advice should not start with a demand. You’re not helping anyone.
