This period of isolation was needed. I finally figured me out. 

It helped me realize what I truly want is financial freedom and to reach that I won’t get there in my current job. 

I’m debating on getting my CDL and driving trucks for a year and using that income to purchase my multi-unit property for passive income. Hopefully I can use that income from that property and driving to purchase an additional multi-unit property and that will lead me to financial freedom. I’m 29. No kids.
