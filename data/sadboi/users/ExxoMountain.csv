BreakUp,fqqnqo3,t3_gkewfa,1589568742.0,I can very much relate to this. I made a hasty decision to ask my bf of 6 yrs to end his 2 month visit with me during quarantine. He broke up with me because of it.  I was so stressed and having a house guest made it ten times worse. Now I wish I hadn't acted so rash because I am even more stressed without him. COVID made us all a little crazy. Like you I am reviewing the things that were off in the relationship and am trying not to discount the big ones. Maybe you two can work this into a break and not a break-up? I am hoping to do that so we can work on the bad things that became super obvious when we were together 24/7.
