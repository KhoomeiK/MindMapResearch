Anxiety,ewjr37m,t1_ewikygy,1565470744.0,People don’t talk about this enough: only certain types of meditation ease certain anxieties. Best advice I’ve ever heard. But people tend to just say “meditate” as if it’s one size fits all.

StrangerThings,et5n67v,t3_c9l5tz,1562480270.0,"I agree: Hopper traveled back in time with the Russians, and all of the scenes in Russia take place in the past.

During the scenes in Russia, everything looks older. They use a hand-cranked gate to release the Demogorgon in Russia, while doors open with keycards in the Hopkins base. At the Russian facility in episode one, the workers wear old-school gas masks, while the Hopkins workers wear more modern hazmat suits in the last episode."
IAmA,es2giep,t1_es0mcbc,1561523613.0,I don’t believe Facebook employees welcome scrutiny so much as recognize it’s part of the job at this point. The sales pitch about new features reminds me of a forum where Kara Swisher talked about the naive optimism of many Bay Area tech bros. There’s a perception that they can just code their way out of ethical dilemmas.

The good news is as you get older, you get tired, you give less fucks and you realize there’s a way more scenic route to take than the race track everyone else is on."
