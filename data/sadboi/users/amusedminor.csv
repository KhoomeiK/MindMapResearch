offmychest,fhyejhs,t1_fhy8ekq,1581974324.0,"This was exactly my experience! When I came out my first year of college, I surrounded myself with everything LGBT: most of my friends were queer, I marched in State Pride, I even obsessed over finding my first girlfriend. I was obnoxiously all about The L Word.

I attribute part of this ‚ÄúI‚Äôm nothing but my sexuality‚Äù attitude to growing up with an ultra conservative Southern Baptist family where even mentioning ‚Äúgays‚Äù was sinful/ frowned upon. Even though I knew I was queer pre-puberty, I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable expressing it until nearly a decade later. And when you finally feel seen, feel free, you can go a little overboard.

Now, in my 30s, my partner and I live a quiet gay life. Most of our friends are straight couples, we‚Äôve been to one pride in a decade, and we‚Äôre completely obsessed with each other. Quiet defiance.

I don‚Äôt fault the LGBT youth exploring what it means to be out, how celebration of personal truth can become a way of life. Most of us have been there."
