One last thing, though I don't know if you would know this, but just in case you do, is it okay if I spell ""licence"" in the MIT license as ""license""? Or is it void like that (modified)? It is because I tend to stick to the British way of spelling, and I don't want to mix them in my use.

Also do you think its enough to distribute the license in English? *Obviously*, I can't encompass every language on Earth, but is the license valid, since I'm a citizen of a country where English is not an official language? I'm thinking the local authority might not recognise it or something.

I just want to know the latest (i.e. most up-to-date) system that works for 32bit PCs. If it was available for 20.04, I wouldn't ask at all. But now I'm asking which is the newest that does have a 32bit image.

First I wanted any because I didn't know that support meant updates. Then you have provided me with info that changed my mind. Now I want the newest but I do not disregard ""supportedness"", because I will continue to get updates for ""x years"" like you say. In short, my point (which you do not understand) does not matter anymore thanks to your info. Disregard what I said before you explained updates.

So can you please just confirm which is the latest 32bit Ubuntu build, so that I can download the correct one? Because one time you say ""AFAIK Xenial is the newest release that is still supported and that has installer images of regular Ubuntu for 32 bit PCs."" and other time you say ""That is not really true.""

> you'll still get updates [...] a pretty important difference

Yes, I see what you mean now. One of us must have confused updates (software, security, etc) and upgrades (14.04->14.10->15.04->you get the idea). What I meant was upgrades, not updates. You were telling me to get the newest possible system because it has updates for the longest now, and I will get security, software, etc, updates for the longest time.

One day, the system will reach ""end-of-life"". After that day, it will not be supported anymore. Normally, you upgrade to a newer release. However, 32bit builds end with Xenial. Therefore, I cannot upgrade after the support ends. Thus, it does not matter to me if the system is still supported or not. It's the same to me.

AskFm,fnbw41w,t3_dvgy75,1586823488.0,Try from another computer. Or maybe it's banned in your country? Try with a VPN.
selfharm,fn1bfha,t3_fyci3t,1586558566.0,"Sometimes, but I don't think I've noticed when it happened. I'm currently on my 15th day, and yesterday it really felt as if I were faking it; today was tougher again so I know I am not. The rest of the two weeks was pretty hard most days. 

Before two weeks, I was on my tenth day or so when I relapsed, before that I failed on like my second or third day. That was after I started actually actively being clean, after (TW) my s... attempt. So I guess I know what you mean. 

Hang in there, I know it's hard, we all do, but it's worth it. So don't worry, there is no ""valid"" or ""not valid"" here."

NoStupidQuestions,fn1a4ro,t3_fy5y7u,1586557830.0,"I can't speak for other places for sure (though I believe it's the same), but in my country it is a custom that the family calls someone to help wash and clothe the body; apparently it's an unwritten rule you cannot refuse to do this. And that person, or someone from the family, will most probably take care of the deceased person's clothing, accessories, and whatever else they had on them - a tampon/pad included - before washing and clothing them.

Of course, if you die in certain different circumstances, this scenario wouldn't happen. I'm thinking of very gory examples but I won't give any. Sometimes my mind scares me."
