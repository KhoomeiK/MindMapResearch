Well done on having the courage to open up about this, i can understand why it's not fun speaking to strangers about this kind of stuff - i'm the same.
About your mum, lockdown is very stressful for everyone and it's easy for us to fall back into bad habits. I myself have fallen back into bad habits like eating too much. What's even worse is that smoking is addictive and stress-relieving, so forgive your mum lol. It's a tough situation and it's not just her that has fallen back into old habits, i'm sure she will quit once again when there's  a little less stress around.

As for wanting to end it all, i think a lot of us can relate. The way you're feeling isn't unusual but at the same time it isn't the healthiest.
How old is your sister? If she's older, would you feel comfortable talking to her about how you're feeling? 

Please remember that A LOT of people care about you deeply, and that they are there for you no matter how you're feeling. Almost everyone is finding it hard to see the bright side of life right now, but hopefully when lockdown is over you'll be able to meet up with your friends again and be in a happier place than you are now :)"

Legally, you mentioned your lawyer is 53rd in the country. Like you said, there is a very real chance he can ace this trial. Your lawyer seems like a good one, so even if you were found guilty, he seems like the type of lawyer that could get you out of registering on the sex offender list. If that happens, then your life after prison (which you may not even end up in) will be perfectly fine. You can work, find relationships, and find genuine normalcy in life. 

I'm not sure if spiritual is the best word, but spiritually, there is always hope. You are a good person. You know you'd never maliciously do such a thing, and good people like you don't deserve a fate as bad as what you think will come. 

Please, i'm begging you to not go through with this. You're loved and you are a good person. There's still so much hope. At this point i don't know what to say i'm just begging, please don't end your story here, your future doesn't hold any of what you've said it will."

SuicideWatch,fol1gjz,t1_foktmol,1587853012.0,"Hmm.
I feel like your mother is definitely using the gifts against you. Even though you're aware of it, it can still be used against you. In psychological terms, it sounds like she's trying to condition you. By associating one of the positive aspects of your life (anime) with her, you subconsciously view her in, not a positive light completely, but a less negative light than you would have. This kind of thing is known as classical conditioning.

I understand you're fully aware she's using it against you, but it's a very slippery slope. Her sending you gifts is pure manipulative and abusive behaviour.

I'm no professional, but I think to fully cut her out of your life, not accepting/keeping the gifts may be a good idea. Maybe you can still accept them but sell them? Then use the money to buy other anime merch? I'm not too sure, but by continuing to accept the gifts it's like she's still latching on to your life, even if just a tiny bit. But if you really want to and you understand all that, then I guess there's no harm keeping it.

But to answer your question, no it doesn't make you a leech, but it does make you a little bit more susceptible to her abuse again :/

I obviously can't comment on whatever has happened in your life so far, but I think that life is too unpredictable to know for certain how it'll end.

Unless you're dying from an incurable disease, then I feel like there's always hope. Even if you were dying from an incurable disease, freak recoveries have been medically documented and do happen (although rare ofc), so even then there's a shed of hope.

My wording may have been off but i hope my perspective still comes across. I hope I don't sound cliche but holding onto the idea of someday being at a better place mentally, spiritually and physically is how I get by day by day, and others too.

As for your ex, the answer comes down to what will make you feel at most peace before you pass. If reconciling with him will give you the most closure before you go, then 100% text him.

Benjy classic 100% is less risky because you're placing the ramp from outside their box, thus trapping them. This version you're trapping both yourself and your opponent.

Your university should be willing to grant an exception, even if you have requested for exceptions before. The number of times you ask for exceptions shouldn't really matter because the mitigating circumstances that caused you to ask for an exception in the first place have not changed.

I feel for you, I really do, I understand you're in a very tough situation, and if i'm being honest I wasn't sure how to go about making this comment at first. 

May I ask why you stopped your creative outlets such as acting and writing? I feel like this is a very healthy way of expressing yourself to the world. Even though you may be 'mute', these outlets would allow you to have the loudest of voices. I'd love to see you take up those hobbies again. 
The reason why I was having trouble writing this comment is because you never said how exactly you ended up in this situation. I understand the situation with your girlfriend is tough in and of itself, but that + your dependancy on drugs + your self harm seem to be the result of something even greater that you don't mention. 
I won't pry as to what that is, but if it is a big event that changed your life, then I would recommend using your creative outlets to express your emotions about the root cause of all this. I personally found it very therapeutic to express my emotions by drawing, it was my way of my anger or my sadness into a tangible thing. It feels like when people self harm, they're trying to express their inner emotional pain with physical pain. Maybe i'm just chatting a lot of shit but that's how I perceive self harm. I feel like dealing with the emotions from whatever life event(s) occurred in your past would be the best way to start moving forward.

As for your opiate and benzodiazipine dependency, this is something i'd definitely seek professional help for. Curbing your dependency is a vital first step to recovery. I know it may seem like drugs is the only thing keeping you going, but in reality it's probably fuelling the worsening of your situation. Curbing this kind of dependency can be challenging, but it's 100% worth it and certainly do-able.

As for your current prescribed antidepressants, I'd go back to your doctor and perhaps ask for a different one. If you explain to him properly that they aren't working that well, any good doctor would consider switching it out for different ones. Everyone responds differently to different antidepressants, and finding the right one is really trial and error most of the time. I hope you find a better medication that suits you.

I don't have a girlfriend so it's hard for me to give advice, but from what i can see it seems that she's in need of help as well. I assume the extent of her drug use is as much as yours. Undergoing treatment to curb the drug misuse becomes a lot easier emotionally when you're on the journey with someone. It seems like you have a partner that will stick with you through thick and thin, even with all the problems you guys are encountering right now. I wish I had someone like that; just remember you're not alone. 

You are wanted. You are loved. I'm glad your roommate called an ambulance, because it would have been a loss to the world if you had died that day. A real tragedy. And i mean it, because you may not feel like it, but your life has so much value and you're deserving of love :)

It doesn't sound like she's in any immediate risk of suicide, but if she is and you feel her life is becoming more endangered, then I'd contact the authorities immediately (even if she begs you not to, her life is still at risk).

Hope this helps a tiny bit."
SuicideWatch,fo2drnf,t3_g5b9kf,1587458535.0,"First of all, everyone's situation is unique so don't feel disheartened to come to this subreddit to vent if you're going through a troubled time and this may be the only way you can speak to someone. That's what this place is for :)

This pandemic is a very difficult and traumatic time for all of us. People are losing their lives, their jobs, their loved-ones. I can guarantee you no one is being productive - everyone is on edge just trying to get by day by day hoping things will get better. But trust me, everyone is doing jack shit. 

How you feel is not out the ordinary at all, in fact, it's quite normal. Your parents' decision to support you going abroad does not necessarily mean they expect you to make the money back, they supported you because it's what you wanted to do. Please don't feel like there needs to be a monetary justification for you to stay abroad.  And using your thought process, dropping out would be an even bigger waste of money because you would have literally achieved nothing. 
Online classes are tough, and I find it extremely hard to concentrate and be productive. But just know that all other students are in the same boat when it comes to online classes, you're definitely not alone in thinking that online classes feel more sluggish and tiring and unproductive. 

I'm a medical student so I can say this about depression:
Depression isn't necessarily a life long thing. Depressive episodes are weird; they can come and go with or without the assistance of medication. They're easily influenced by the world around us, so experiencing a worsening of depression during this tension-filled time of covid isn't out of the ordinary. Many types of depression can come and go, for example postnatal depression, which only really affects mothers after birth but is normally resolved within a year. I would ask your psychiatrist for a re-evaluation, and they should be understanding given the what the world is currently facing. I imagine your psychiatrist simply assumed your depressive episode had finished for some reason (which is the wrong thing to do), but i'm sure getting re-evaluated for depression would solve that. But in general, I would trust your psychiatrist. And if they prescribe you meds, take it as instructed :)

Hoping things get better for you."

I assume you're not asking out of mere curiosity, so please do not take it.

Those 3 are not a good mix at all, grapefruit juice inhibits the metabolic pathway of xanax (CYP3A4) which will lead to much higher levels of it in your blood. Combined with a depressant like alcohol, seems like a recipe for disaster. 

Because that's what it would be, a disaster and a tragedy. If you need someone to talk to, please don't be afraid to reach out or seek help from somewhere like a suicide prevention line. There are people that understand your situation and are willing to talk to you. There are also people that love you and want the best for you, even if it doesn't seem like it sometimes. 

If your xanax is prescribed, please continue taking the dosage your doctor instructed and please seek help. I don't want you gone. Please seek some support, because there is always support available :)"

SuicideWatch,fntizco,t3_g3sz2y,1587242610.0,"Hey, on top of the things everyone has said here (which are true), i thought i'd offer my thoughts from a more healthcare-orientated point of view.
Being a medical student, I often wonder about how i'm going to deal with the fact that my own clinical error may indirectly lead to patient's death. And i'm sure you know it's not an uncommon thing at all. 

But your case is different. You mention the patient you caught covid from was the first death in your state, which leads me to think that back then there wasn't much, if at all, precaution taken when it came to things like PPE, isolation etc etc. I'm from the UK but keep up to date with US politics, and I'm well aware that the response to covid was slow and delayed on both a federal and state level (especially federal lol). 
You had no idea your patient had coronavirus, and you already worked your shift in the nursing home before you found out. You are NOT at fault. Even if you were sick, since it was so early on in the breakout, no one can and will blame you for still going into work. Especially in this day and age, where people live paycheck to paycheck and skipping work simply isn't an option, even with flu-like symptoms. 
This is NOT your fault by any means. Please forgive yourself, because no one simply knew about the severity of the covid situation when you caught it. It was unavoidable and not malicious, so please forgive yourself. 

I am extremely sorry to hear about the situation with your girlfriend. As cliche as it sounds, with every end is a new beginning. And i hope you can heal from this break up soon. I'm sure it hurts in ways I can't understand, but i guarantee you it will get better.


If you need someone to speak to, try speaking to some patients. Patients have given me some of the wisest advice that I won't forget for the rest of my life.

Suicide is not the answer. I understand it's easy to blame yourself for what happened, but you will learn to forgive yourself the more you realise that this situation was inevitable. 

Hope you're doing okay."

yes.

Because they did know the word existed, they know its history, they know they shouldn't say it, they know the word itself hurts people, yet he used it. I don't care about how he feels in all honesty, if you feel like shit for using a word that makes other people feel subhuman, regardless of the context, then too bad. Say the n word all you want in whatever context you please, but when you get called out for it and repeatedly reminded that you're a shitty person for using it, don't fucking cry. Just don't fucking say it, it's really REALLY simple.

I refuse to believe a 17 year old doesn't understand the problems with using the n word. And people reading this probably don't feel personally attacked, but honestly if you're black and understand your own history, you'd realise why that word is an intense trigger. If you're not black, i doubt you'd be able to fully empathise. You can understand why it's offensive, but you'll never know the feeling of it personally. Of course he didn't use it in a context to hurt others, which i understand and respect, but the word itself is the entire issue. It's not *how* he used the word, it's the fact that it came out of his mouth is the problem. Context honestly doesn't matter.

(inb4 this gets downvoted by non-black people that want so desperately to try and emulate black culture by using a word they think makes them look cool or edgey, just to get triggered when they get called out for it. Fucking cringe.)

As for thanksgiving, I'm not American so I can't personally understand. But yeah, it must be hard for Native Americans to have to sit through a national holiday, year by year, that celebrates the mass rape, murder and theft of their people. That's actually pretty fucking sickening."
