There’s really no third option. Your message will not provide her with any new information. She was already rejected and apologized showing she knew her advances were not welcome and she recognized it. Your message will not provide her with any new information. 

You just want to send this message because you’re insecure and shaken by all this. Any girl would be upset about something like this initially but a person who was secure in themselves would ultimately realize there is no threat. The fact that you still feel so much about this and feel the need to take further actions just shows you feel threatened, and no matter what you say in the message, your message will be saying that to her. “I feel threatened by you.” 

Essentially, sending her a message about how “not cool” it was will only serve to make you look insecure and make her feel like she has power."

So I think this is a classic case of false belief based on your emotions. You can’t trust how you feel as a metric for what you believe. 

Logically, you have to recognize 30 is pretty young. 
Logically, you have to realized that people of all ages and stages get diagnosed and get help. 
Logically, you have to know that you can still go back to school or change your career path or set your life into a completely different trajectory. 

You just don’t FEEL like any of this is possible because of the pain you’re in, and from the guilt and shame you may feel inside. But you can’t be led by these emotions. You can’t trust your own brain in this case. The BPD is telling you that you can’t do anything. The BPD is filling you with shame and making you FEEL like a lost cause. You are not. Logically, you just aren’t.

I consider myself fairly logical too. It’s an interesting part of the BPD condition. Many of us are completely capable of thinking with sane, rational logic.

If you step back and look at it objectively, it’s just as much her responsibility and yours to plan for your child’s financial future. The burden is far from being solely on you. & people don’t generally save up to pay for expensive medical treatmeants for fairly rare conditions. It’s not something that would be reasonable expected of you. 

It is always tempting to find a scapegoat because when you’re in such pain, it can give temporarily relief to find someone, anyone, to blame. Then that pain to anger, and take it out on the “guilty” object of your anger. 

But life is messy and the only thing that can lead help with managing the pain is to radically accept the pain and difficulty as it is. Without blame. It might temporarily feel better to blame someone, but the fallout from this can be irreperable. 

I recommend therapy for you and ESPECIALLY your wife. I say especially your wife because she is clearly using an unhealthy coping mechanism to manage her trauma (blame and anger directed toward someone she should be using as her support system).

Obviously there are women with difficult pregnancies, and most women deal with some amount of discomfort or annoyance during pregnancy, but I really believe for the vast majority it feels like a natural part of life, which is a mix of really amazing feelings, and some crappy uncomfortable feelings too. So many hard core pro choicers frame a natural bodily process like pregnancy as being something scary, awful, parasitic, a burden, etc for EVERYONE and it really annoys me."

Parenting,f0tit0d,t1_f0stvl2,1568922877.0,YES. Kids tease because they like to get a reaction. I’ve noticed that kids that react strongly to things get the most consistently teased and taunted.
BPD4BPD,f0px8f5,t1_f0prlo3,1568849617.0,"BPD is for people who are self aware enough to realize what’s going on and are seeking help. BPDlovedones largely consists of people who are clearly mentally unwell too, but instead of turning inward and focusing on their own healing, they try to feel better by labeling a “bad guy” that they can all rally against. People in pain love to find a scapegoat. 

That isn’t to say that there aren’t people on the subreddit that are genuine abuse victims of pwBPD, but the way many people on there paint all pwBPD with such a broad brush....it’s very sickening."
BPD4BPD,f0ppqlx,t1_f0oat6u,1568841927.0,"I suggested to the mods that they add a rule that people who post actually have to clarify if the person they are referring to has been diagnosed with BPD, but they pretty quickly poo-pooed that idea. Honestly a lot of the people on that subreddit sound like they want to slap a mental illness on the object of their anger and enlist the help of good old Dr Google for diagnosis."
RealEstate,f0p3m4r,t1_f0p2zy0,1568826441.0,"My issue was more of the popcorn ceiling than the presence of asbestos in general, because I feel that damage is more likely to occur in popcorn ceiling, as opposed to asbestos that is enclosed in tiles or something like that"
RealEstate,f0p3b99,t1_f0p2q1l,1568826246.0,"For us, meaning that we were getting a home inspector that could also do asbestos testing. It’s an add on option, yes."
RealEstate,f0p0enk,t1_f0otmn4,1568824379.0,I see.
RealEstate,f0on3bq,t1_f0ohucl,1568815538.0,What do you mean “let us” test? This is just part of the home inspection process for us. I was never told we’d have to ask permission.

intermittentfasting,ezx1b38,t1_ezwtj5n,1568229818.0,"Agreed! There’s something that I’ve recently been clued in on called “mindful eating”, the basic concept being putting more thought and attention on enjoying the food, the setting, and everything else about the experience instead of scarfing it down your gullet and falling into binge eating habits. Learning to eat mindfully helps you learn to eat in moderation and just have a healthier relationship to food in general."
