You just want to send this message because you‚Äôre insecure and shaken by all this.

The burden is far from being solely on you. & people don‚Äôt generally save up to pay for expensive medical treatmeants for fairly rare conditions.

It is always tempting to find a scapegoat because when you‚Äôre in such pain, it can give temporarily relief to find someone, anyone, to blame. Then that pain to anger, and take it out on the ‚Äúguilty‚Äù object of your anger. 

But life is messy and the only thing that can lead help with managing the pain is to radically accept the pain and difficulty as it is. Without blame. It might temporarily feel better to blame someone, but the fallout from this can be irreperable.

PCOS,f1qpxas,t3_daiq46,1569704741.0,Absolutely!
Parenting,f1n92lo,t1_f1n8rxz,1569611775.0,Yeah I think that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm having issues too. I like to be able to quickly finish up and make an escape if things go south.
Parenting,f1n8bm6,t1_f1n80cp,1569611282.0,Awesome! Glad to hear other people do it as well. :-) Maybe it‚Äôs just that you don‚Äôt see many larger families these days and that‚Äôs the reason I don‚Äôt see it much anymore.
prolife,f1lefef,t3_d9ls8h,1569552597.0,"As a woman, I also get annoyed at the way pro choice people make pregnancy to make it sound like it‚Äôs absolutely awful. I have been pregnant 3 times and I was a totally happy, healthy, and capable person for the majority of it up until pretty much the day I gave birth. Obviously there are women with difficult pregnancies, and most women deal with some amount of discomfort or annoyance during pregnancy, but I really believe for the vast majority it feels like a natural part of life, which is a mix of really amazing feelings, and some crappy uncomfortable feelings too. So many hard core pro choicers frame a natural bodily process like pregnancy as being something scary, awful, parasitic, a burden, etc for EVERYONE and it really annoys me."

Parenting,f0tit0d,t1_f0stvl2,1568922877.0,YES. Kids tease because they like to get a reaction. I‚Äôve noticed that kids that react strongly to things get the most consistently teased and taunted.
BPD4BPD,f0px8f5,t1_f0prlo3,1568849617.0,"BPD is for people who are self aware enough to realize what‚Äôs going on and are seeking help. BPDlovedones largely consists of people who are clearly mentally unwell too, but instead of turning inward and focusing on their own healing, they try to feel better by labeling a ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù that they can all rally against. People in pain love to find a scapegoat. 

That isn‚Äôt to say that there aren‚Äôt people on the subreddit that are genuine abuse victims of pwBPD, but the way many people on there paint all pwBPD with such a broad brush....it‚Äôs very sickening."
BPD4BPD,f0ppqlx,t1_f0oat6u,1568841927.0,"I suggested to the mods that they add a rule that people who post actually have to clarify if the person they are referring to has been diagnosed with BPD, but they pretty quickly poo-pooed that idea. Honestly a lot of the people on that subreddit sound like they want to slap a mental illness on the object of their anger and enlist the help of good old Dr Google for diagnosis."
RealEstate,f0p3m4r,t1_f0p2zy0,1568826441.0,"My issue was more of the popcorn ceiling than the presence of asbestos in general, because I feel that damage is more likely to occur in popcorn ceiling, as opposed to asbestos that is enclosed in tiles or something like that"
RealEstate,f0p3b99,t1_f0p2q1l,1568826246.0,"For us, meaning that we were getting a home inspector that could also do asbestos testing. It‚Äôs an add on option, yes."
RealEstate,f0p0enk,t1_f0otmn4,1568824379.0,I see.
RealEstate,f0on3bq,t1_f0ohucl,1568815538.0,What do you mean ‚Äúlet us‚Äù test? This is just part of the home inspection process for us. I was never told we‚Äôd have to ask permission.

intermittentfasting,ezx1b38,t1_ezwtj5n,1568229818.0,"Agreed! There‚Äôs something that I‚Äôve recently been clued in on called ‚Äúmindful eating‚Äù, the basic concept being putting more thought and attention on enjoying the food, the setting, and everything else about the experience instead of scarfing it down your gullet and falling into binge eating habits. Learning to eat mindfully helps you learn to eat in moderation and just have a healthier relationship to food in general."
