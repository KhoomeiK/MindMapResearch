My kids' dad is normally a good dad who will talk a lot woth the kids because he prefers reason over ""you have to"".

If you skip a day, they say to just keep taking the same packet. Two days, start another one. You're already screwing with the efficiency. Now if you took one the morning, then skipped two days, then took it at night? Or you forgot multiple days, just not in a row? 

I have also lost a packet, I have forgotten I was on it, Etc, etc. I'm not saying a woman will not fake she has forgotten the pill to actually get pregnant, that does happen. Of course. But accidents do too. Genuine ones. A pretty good proof is that women may get an abortion in that scenario."

flexibility,fligqd4,t1_flifxxs,1585182161.0,"It's not mean, don't worry! Maybe you already have that kind of flexibilty but a few weeks ago, when trying to lower myself in a 90 degrees angle, my back would curve and it would pull a lot on the muscles in my legs. So I've been working to be able to get lower and keeping my back straight even in this position. My goal is to be able to reach the ground without curving it. Try to look at your back in the mirror when reaching for your toes and maybe compare with others if your back doesn't curve.  


And yes back curve to the kidneys level when you're standing, but in this position, your back is most likely to do a round bridge shape and you want to keep it flat if you're practising flexibility.

\-I practised every occasion I had to lower myself keeping my back straight (ie when I wanted to grab something that was lower)

\-I've also used weights to try to get lower in this position (I don't know if it does something)
