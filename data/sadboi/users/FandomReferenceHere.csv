Several friends recommended Discworld to me when I was at college. Being a completist, I thought I'd start with the first two. They were fine, I suppose, and I enjoyed them, but they didn't grab me. I didn't get why Discworld was so important to so many people. So I stopped.

And it took me ten fucking years to pick up another Discworld book, and I love them so much that I often fall asleep listening to the audiobooks, and I really resent missing out on those ten years that I could have been in the fandom! I was a theatre student and we did a lot of Shakespeare, and Wyrd Sisters would have rocked my world.

That said, I do think that reading in publication order gives a newbie the best experience. But you might have to give them a ""better"" book to get them hooked. I always give my victims either G!G! or Hogfather, depending on what I think they'll like best. (I see a lot of people are saying G!G! or Mort, which totally makes sense.

Lithops,fntdk0j,t3_g3r1vh,1587239507.0,"I am by no means an expert but here's my two cents:

IF that lithops was in its own pot, AND you knew that it wasn't at the end of its growing cycle (meaning, it's not about to split), THEN I would say that there's a 50-50 chance you should water it, but it wouldn't hurt to leave it another month.

But I can see that its neighbors are plump and full and happy! So my guess is to definitely leave it alone for another month, and then water just that side of the pot, so that whatever the other guys suck up doesn't make them burst.

All that being said, if it were me, I would pull out that little guy and put him in his own pot and water him and he would probably die. (I bought 4 of that variety at a big box store about 6 months ago and only 1 has survived. I just mess with them too much.)

Just let those outer leaves wrinkle up to hard dry husks on their own. Then, when your new babies start to look wrinkly a few months after that, give them a few good soaks.

For him, it's just normal. It's fun to explain this to children, because there is a definite developmental moment around age 7 or so where they can understand this concept. 

\- Jumping off something for the first time takes a while, but after that he knows how tall it is and it's not scary. For example, the curbs on sidewalks don't faze him at all, nor the picnic tables at our dog park.

\- He likes to play fetch, but he stands still and waits until the ball or toy comes to a complete stop, and then goes to find it. He still loses it pretty frequently.

Plenty of feral cats will come in for a meal and a cuddle and then fuck off.

But the demand for pedigree dogs is what keeps horrible/disgusting/evil puppy farms in existence. 

If your dog is a show dog, then why is that hobby important enough to justify all the Tibetan terriers who have miserable lives because someone wants to make money from breeding them?

If your dog is not a show dog, then why not rescue a non-certified Tibetan terrier?

I have adopted a purebred Lhasa Apso and a purebred Shih Tzu. (I love all dogs but prefer to own the small fluffy ones.) They were both given to shelters by irresponsible breeders for minor issues, like an overbite, that meant they couldn’t be show dogs.

Practically every breed has a rescue organization. 

I’m not always against getting a puppy farm dog. I have another comment on this thread about how it really helped my aunt. But I think that you’re part of the problem."
aww,fgr23k5,t1_fgqsrfu,1581036428.0,"Yes! This is an important nuance! 

When my mother’s brother suddenly died, his widow moved in with us. She was of course incredibly distraught, and she’s a huge dog person. My parents bought her a runt Shih Tzu at the Petland down the road, a dog that was so overbred and needy that EVEN PETLAND was like “sorry but we can’t let her go to your home yet.” My aunt went there twice a day to bottle feed this little pup for about a month, and then brought her home, and the dog had a wonderful life, and my aunt had a purpose at a time she really really needed one. 

In an ideal world this dog wouldn’t even exist. But since the dog DID exist, well, she was a living thing that needed a happy ending and got it!!!!"

Even when I was [brainwashed evangelical] religious, I never understood the people who thought “God gave us this, so we can abuse it if we want.” Surely, if God gave us dominion over the animals, then God also expects us to be responsible stewards of that ownership!

Divorce,fghih1g,t1_fgguubj,1580785558.0,"I'm going to disagree with ajisaqueef's comment and say that this didn't strike me as arrogant.

As a straight woman, I don't know what guy-on-guy interactions about divorce look like, but I imagine there's lots of (performative?) bro-ness going on.

And also as a straight woman, when a straight guy friend tells me he's getting a divorce, I DEFINITELY do that microsecond calculation of ""he is now potentially available; am I interested?""

As you say, that can be horrible. It's a selfish response, if also a very human one. (I mean... I'm pretty that sure most humans go through their day with a subconscious ""is this a potential sexual partner"" about every person they interact with.)

The reactions DO suck. That said, if you're getting a lot of ""maybe we could fuck"" vibes, maybe you could explore that and enjoy yourself?"
lonely,fghhdzg,t3_ey81hv,1580784863.0,"When things are difficult, and it's hard to make connections, then small talk is bullshit. Flirting is bullshit. All of that is performative nonsense. 

Some people are good at that performative nonsense in their teens and early 20s. Some people aren't. Whether or not you can do the ""let's talk and flirt like we're in an unrealistic teen romantic comedy"" thing doesn't have ANYTHING to do with whether you'll have happy and fulfilling romantic relationships in your life.

What do you WANT to say to a girl? You could say ""I like your tshirt"" or ""I'm sorry if this is weird, but you have beautiful eyes"" or ""You seem really interesting and I'd like to get to know you better."" It doesn't have to be rocket surgery."

Lithops,fghej0t,t3_eygzmy,1580783064.0,"This is just my opinion and I'm by no means an expert!

You can see, especially on the right-hand side, that it's becoming concave, and the ""window"" bits are becoming little canyons. You can also see in the middle that it's just-barely-maybe beginning to split.

My recommendation is this: shine your phone flashlight into the center and see if you can see the next set of leaves coming up close to the top. If you can, then let the splitting happen and don't water until the outer leaves are practically husks.

But my guess is that the new set of leaves is pretty deep down. In that case, it's off the natural cycle (as pretty much all store-bought Lithops are) and you can give it a good soaking now, and every time it gets this shrunken, until you can easily see that it's splitting, at which point you leave it alone. But don't water more than once a month, and you can easily have a happy Lithops that only gets watered 4x a year.

I'd say that this little guy is just beginning to get thirsty. If it were me, I'd leave it another month, and 2 months would be too much."

If you look at some of OP's comments, OP says that the dad is trying to be really supportive, has offered multiple times to set up appointments with therapists/psychologists, and was bringing a book for an exam that OP was having soon.

It's ok if you didn't read through those comments, of course, that's not a requirement.

Even if you just walk into their office and sit there in silence for 50 or 55 minutes. That's ok. That's what they're there for. You don't have to be able to explain yourself. You don't have to defend yourself or what you're feeling."

Lithops,ffs3d73,t1_ffrz8he,1580172127.0,"Straight up pebbles is actually a good thing! You don't want to fill in the gaps, especially not with sand, which will retain way too much moisture. Personally I use ""soil"" from Bonsai Jacks (is it ok to say that? other pebbles are available....) which is just a bunch of small rocks of different kinds with 10% organic matter. They'll also do just fine without any organic matter at all. They like rocks.

Don't water them until the outer leaves have shriveled away to papery thin husks. Then, YMMV. I found that watering once a month was actually too much. A guy at my local nursery says he waters his 3x a year. Depends on your climate, the sun, the humidity, etc, but you don't want to water them until they're thirsty.

Yours look perfectly healthy and happy to me. Good luck!
