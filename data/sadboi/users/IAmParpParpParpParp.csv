I approached her and offered to buy her groceries.  She was really worked up and upset, so I invited her for coffee/tea at the Coffee Bean in the market.  

Sorry, long story, but I ended up calling the 800 number and was on hold for 47 minutes.  I was able to speak to the representative on the other end of the line and explained the situation.  She was very kind and helpful.  The representative emailed all the information to the older lady's caseworker based in Glendale.

While I wasn't expecting to spend 47 minutes on hold and handling something like this that day, it was worth it when she called me to let me know that her benefit kicked in 4 hours later.

He's the best kisser and lover I'd ever had, and I've been fortunate to have had a handful of amazing lovers.  Today the glow overflowed and cast a lovely/happy shadow.  I worked and had wonderful interactions with the sweetest people in a work setting that is ideal.  My co-worker are people I have deep affection for, and I thought a few years ago that I wasn't capable of tapping into feeling of love/affection.
