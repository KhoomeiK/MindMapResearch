Advice,fk4x0p6,t3_fggjm0,1583869236.0,"Hi there, I don't know if this helps at all - but I think you have to be happy being yourself. You're great, right? People are going to be drawn to you if you seem like you have it all figured out. It sounds like you're depressed and that's possibly the vibe you have. Once you decide that you're good, that you're open to love but solid without it, that's when you'll start actually seeing the people who like you romantically. I hope at the same time you realize who is worth your love and you don't waste it. 

Good luck, friend!"

SO should consider your feelings, but sometimes they just don't get it and you really have to spell it out. You ARE addressing the problem, so he needs to be careful not the become a part of the problem."
AskReddit,ffxbz3d,t1_ffx0uda,1580322025.0,I would add to this that we should stop feeling like telling someone you have a problem is admitting weakness. Recognizing a problem and seeking help is possibly the bravest and strongest thing you will ever do.
AskReddit,ffx9th8,t1_ffx9q34,1580320740.0,"""TheÂ Durrell Wildlife Conservation TrustÂ recently welcomed a baby African Crested Porcupine named Pippa or Pip for short. Baby porcupines are called ""porcupettes"" and their quills are soft for the first few days. However in adulthood this porcupine's quills provide a potent defensive weapon.""

EatingDisorders,ffv50mx,t3_evd6r2,1580255824.0,"I don't think it sounds disordered, but I'm not a doctor. I recently came into the understanding that I have ED, so I don't think I have a lot of perspective yet. I binge, and then I stop eating for days. And then I binge. I also only eat in secret and when I eat, it doesn't matter what it is, I will eat so much I get sick. But above everything, it's the obsession. I literally only think about food with short bursts of other stuff. To me, your situation sounds like most women who didn't used to have weight problems and got older and now struggle. As with most medical things, I would highly recommend you see a doctor and a nutritionist - hopefully they can help you sort out your relationship with food before you have a problem. Just don't let it spiral, it can become all consuming before you even realize it."

She remarried someone with a lot of money and was able to legally assault my brother in and out of court. I have no idea how any of what she did was allowed and even reinforced by the justice system. 

 I know why he had to do it, and I also know why it eats at him. What scares me is how she has probably grown up believing she was assaulted in so many damaging ways and none of it was true (hopefully not true still but we haven't seen the child in over 7 years)."
