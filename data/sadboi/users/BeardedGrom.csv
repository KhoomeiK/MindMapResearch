Also if you don't get along with the relatives of your ex it's maybe better to have them not attend on the ""main event""?

With cutting i started just a few years ago when i was around 30 and problems in my marriage increased. My wife started to keep a distance to me, but blamed it on some kind of childhood trauma first... long story short, she kinda used that as an excuse to manipulate me and just kept making promises she never even sought to fulfill. Then when i confronted her about the persisting relationship issues (she wouldn't even hug me anymore when i felt down at this point), SHE blamed ME for not doing enough for her. Kinda trapped between her lies and still wanting to help her, some day when we got in a fight again i just couldn't take it anymore, so i burned my wrist on the edge of a hot frying pan and cut me with a kitchen knife. It helped me calm down so much better than everything before, i almost completely switched to cutting after that (but this time with a razorblade)."
