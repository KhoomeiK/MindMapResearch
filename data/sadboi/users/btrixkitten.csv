depression,fpwg23c,t3_gfqlvd,1588962818.0,yes.  I have struggle with this for years. being on medication is the only thing that has helped. have you considered tying that? If not a more natural method would be to try exercising during the day. that can do wonders!
depression,fph6lnl,t3_gdbth4,1588615874.0,me too
depression,fpgucx2,t1_fpfa8o5,1588609670.0,"I'm so sorry to hear that. breakups are hard enough on their own. I had just started a new job before the lockdown so I was excited to mak money and go out on dates and stuff. So it's frustrating to have to wait even longer.
Very crummy situation all around."
depression,fpdn3te,t3_gcqww5,1588530260.0,this is so real. I'm right there with you. I'm wasting a good part of the last year of my 20s going through a fucking pandemic. It sucks
depression,fpdm9j1,t3_gcnpaj,1588529780.0,"I just turned 29 this year. When I was your age I felt the way you did. It may not get better, but it gets easier. You still have  time to turn things around. Decide what you want out of your life and run with it. What are you most passionate about? Think about what that is and pursue it to your fullest potential. That's what will make you happy. Take it from someone whose 20s are almost over lol."

depression,fhg4813,t1_fhffc85,1581558222.0,"I would try going to a counselor then. Go to them in person and say you want to talk about your depression. I never did this when I was in high school but I wish I had. I was at my lowest back then, constantly tired and lonely and just hated myself. School counselors are there for people like you. I'm sure they'd be happy to listen. 
If they don't come through, you're always welcome to message me! <3"
depression,fhfee0e,t3_f2k58x,1581541709.0,"yes. 100%, I feel this way all the time. I don't necessarily want to die, but I don't want my life to keep going in the direction it's going. 

I've been super depressed recently and just don't want to deal with anything."
depression,fhfe50q,t3_f2v95u,1581541566.0,"Is there a counselor at school you could talk to? Or a favorite teacher you can open up to? There are people around who care.  I think if you talked to a professional they could really help. It took my family a long time to understand the severity of my depression. 

Try going for walks or runs, sometimes that can help clear your head and create endorphins! Hope this helps, you are loved."

Unemployed,fhfbm0d,t1_fh9q3fa,1581540136.0,"Yeah, the thing is I moved back in with them a couple years ago. I hated my life every day I lived there. I'm really trying to avoid it."

Music,fgexp86,t3_ey1be3,1580714191.0,"ooh this is a tough one. I've always really appreciated both artists and consider them both to be influences on my songwriting and vocal style. I think they're both talented in different ways. Lana has a beautiful ethereal voice and has very relatable lyrics, some of her music even feels cinematic. While Beach House seems to have a kind of dreamy feel you can get lost in. I don't find one artist to be better than the other, considering the differences in their styles. Victoria is a little more multi faceted in the sense she can sing and play synth, while Lana is really more just focused on singing while she performs. I appreciate them both for their musical capabilities. Way too hard to answer lol. Though I did discover beach house before Lana and consider them to be one of my most favorite bands :)"
depression,fgew9rf,t3_exwoqx,1580712460.0,"I'm really sorry you're going through this. Life is so fucking tough. I really know how you feel. I am just now getting back on meds and feel like my life is always and uphill battle without them. I hope things get better for you, whatever you're going through. I'm here to talk if you need a friend. Giving you a big fat virtual hug. xxx"

Unemployed,f8newdl,t1_f8ndxc1,1574642687.0,It's probably because my motivation and my heart is never in it. I think my employers can pick up on it. I've been fighting depression a lot which also doesn't help
Unemployed,f8neqk2,t1_f8mmqce,1574642626.0,not sure honestly. this last time it was because I called out sick. otherwise I feel like I just keep ending up at the wrong jobs.
depression,f7pccgb,t3_dx4gwa,1573947407.0,"I feel you so hard. I just got fired from my full time job because I physically couldn't get myself to go into work. It's nice to have the money but it is such a time sucker. Would also cause me a lot of anxiety. Maybe try finding a job that you enjoy doing more or working two different part time jobs so it seems less redundant? 

If you need to talk I'm here for you."
