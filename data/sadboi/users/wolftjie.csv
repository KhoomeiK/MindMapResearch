AskVegans,flwp3an,t3_frdruz,1585559384.0,"I have been thinking about this topic for years.  
I've been living ""vegan""/plant based for 3 years now. Unlike many vegans I eat honey and I believe that it's okay for omnivorous animals like humans to eat meat. I just hate factory farms and the lack of dignity that animals get in our society, for example shaping their flesh in sausages and dinosaur nuggets, which just feels morbid to me, or not eating all of their flesh because some of it isn't as delicious as chicken breast or beef fillet. That's why I boycott nearly anything from the animal industry, exceptions being things like when a really nice granny offers me a slice of cake at some social event once a year or so, cause come on, grannies are the best.  


anyway, here is my take on carnivorous and omnivorous animals:

* they're perfectly fine in nature and I have nothing against them, and that includes indigenous human ethnicities (not calling them animals!! they're obviously humans with rights and dignity, just saying they still live with nature and that kinda makes them part of the ecosystem) because they usually respect their prey and are very thankful when they catch something and don't waste it or treat animals with gluttony and greed.
* I'm unsure about whether humans that care about animals (vegans) should keep dogs and cats as pets because most of their mainstream food also comes from the animal industry I am so keen on not supporting.  
I have heard of vegan diets for cats and dogs, and apparently it works well and isn't animal abuse as long as you monitor your pet's nutrition very closely. I'm not quite sure what to think about that.  
I would love to have a pet some day, preferably something like a goat (I know, not very likely cause who can care for goats while working full time), but I really don't know how to feel about the idea of using an animal as a cuddly bear, seems a little selfish, but pet owners, please tell me your opinion.   


also please tell me if what I said about indigenous people sounds/inherently is racist cause then I'll remove it, I'm a little unsure"

This is partially a myth.  
The decline in births around that time has more to do with the sudden change in social status of women than with oral contraceptives.  
Contraceptives don't help you if you are the wife of a sexist who believes a woman has no right to decide whether she wants to become pregnant or not.  
This is why giving free contraceptives to developing countries to prevent large family sizes where the parents can't feed all the children isn't necessarily going to solve the problem for all women.

Even if I get bad feedback from other people, I know I can turn to them for validation, and because they are my friends, what they say outweighs what everyone else says.  


Maybe discussing your special interests with other people who have similar interests can also help? Like finding a subreddit about your interest (for me that would be r/crochet, r/fountainpens, r/veganism) where everyone else is also deeply into the thing or even finding something like a convention (for anime/cartoon fans) or a club (for sports or other activities). Basically anything where other people agree that your special interest is valid.  


I also think that it's nice if neurodivergent people talk about their special interest to one another. We understand the spark of joy that the other person feels when they can tell us something geeky without us rolling our eyes at them.

That is not the same as rape, unless they were forced/blackmailed to consent (although I dunno how the legal situation is, exactly). Regretting sex you've consented is a painful thing that many people go through, but it isn't really the other person's fault.If you are planning to have sex, it's best to make sure you and the other person don't get too drunk to make sure everything goes well.

Drunk driving is very dangerous and unethical due to the fact that your reaction time is significantly larger and you are worse at estimating distances.

Unless, of course, it contains baking powder and vinegar, then use up the batter as quickly as possible after adding in the vinegar, for extra fluffiness.

-any other ground nut/seed, but flax really works best

-aquafaba, you can even foam it before adding it to the pancakes for extra fluff

If you have had issues with an eating disorder before, you might fear sugar in a similar way that I fear rotten apples.   


Also bread contains no sugar, it's starch, which, yes, is a carbohydrate, and yes, it is broken down into sugar by your saliva and stomach enzymes, but this process doesn't go as fast as you might imagine, especially if the bread is made from whole grains."

My favourite refridgerated fake meat is soy Schnitzel. I like both ""RÃ¼genwalder MÃ¼hle"" 's (I think it costs around 2,79 for two), and Aldi's (the ones from the cardboard box are cheaper than the ones from the plastic container, I think, but Aldi has both for some reason)

It says to fry them nice and crispy in the pan, but i usually make a sandwich with them straight from the packaging."

ADHD,eykh82l,t3_cxdolg,1567151467.0,"Yeah, as far as I'm concerned, it is pretty normal for people with ADHD to work best under pressure. I definitely know these things from my own life.

A therapist of mine once told me if you were to test all surgeons and firefighters for ADHD you would find that the percentage is way higher than in the general population.

We seek the challenge 'cause real life is bland to us. Sadly, not everything in life can be changing and entertaining, so we need to make routines for the things we dislike doing.

For example, I personally think that brushing my teeth is a drag, and I will postpone it until 2 minutes before I have to take the school bus and then basically just rinse my mouth with toothpaste, which is suboptimal. That is because I have no proper morning routine. 

On the other hand, picking up my plate and carrying it to the kitchen when I'm done eating comes naturally to me, even though I struggled with it as a child. That is because at some point my parents started to be very strict with me about it and never let it slide, and now it has become a routine.

Having strict (but loving!) parents can really make a difference when you have ADHD, because you have to learn everything else all by yourself, and in my experience, that is way harder."
ADHD,exkie7z,t3_ctfxvg,1566390460.0,"I started writing my 20 page scientific report on ethnomusicology this week, it's due in November.
Actually writing. Not just ""doing research"" (on reddit and instagram), but actually going to the university's library, getting a library card, taking out books, scanning them for the two pages they might have about my very narrow topic (the history of Isicathamiya singing in South Africa) and taking notes on my computer."
