In the morning, I can't motivate myself out of bed, whether I slept or not (I often don't, or sleep at random times). It just seems to pointless to keep going, and like things would be better if I just never even sat up.

I see people making jokes about cutting themselves, and at the same time I'm looking at their jokes with a sharp object always close by. Also, all those people who clearly aren't depressed* being like ""lol I'm so depressed ðŸ¤ª"" and calling it a mental breakdown when they dye their hair.

People who think less of someone because of their looks should not be listened to. You said you were proud of the short hair, so own it. If you like it, that's what is important. 

Also, side note, social media likes are not an accurate indicator of anything, considered the algorithms that many apps use, and the amount of times people see your posts may change"
