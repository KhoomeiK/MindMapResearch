mentalhealth,f7kipp6,t3_dwmnok,1573812509.0,"My classmate in college graduated from MSD High School this year. She was also in class during the time of the shooting, MSD is a huge school though. She took online classes for the duration of her time at high school. Dealt with guilt and anxiety. Lots of her friends attended the march for our lives in DC. 
Just know it’s okay to feel what you are feeling now. Accept the emotions as they come. There is no “right” way to handle it. It may take a while. Ask for help. Join support groups. 
I remember she said for a lot of her friends, they channeled the anger they had into pressure on gun reform. 
She felt she had to do the same, but her coping wasn’t the same as her friends. Just remember everyone is different, but you will never stand alone."
