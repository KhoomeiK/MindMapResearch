It teaches hope against hope and optimism at all times. I would definitely argue this is not always good, and actually sometimes harmful. Every time a calamity strikes, it's always ""read the Quran and pray."" But then one does. And the calamity gets worse. Another 2 calamities hit. ""Read the Quran and pray"" again. And any questioning is met with ""you didn't read enough prayers etc etc"" or ""prayer doesn't mean relief from adversity, calamity will strike but still pray."" Isn't this, from a psychological point of view, backward? Why does a sentient being pray if not for relief? ""If not here, you will get the relief in the afterlife"" - this is another argument, it's as bad as the capitalism ""keep working hard and one day you'll get rich"" line.
