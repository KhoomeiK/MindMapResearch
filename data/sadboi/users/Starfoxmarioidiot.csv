I was mostly into oscars at the time because they were supposed to be good for that size tank. I had traded all my tetras and a blue crab back to the aquarium shop for store credit (the tetras didn’t have enough room to school, and the crab kept getting in the filter), but I kept my plecostomus, Pleco. A few years later, she got ich, and I was treating her until I woke up to find the oscars had bullied her to death when I put her back in the main tank.

I mourned every fish I ever lost, but that made me give up aquariums. It hurts.

If you can find someone with a common goal, or even a collective attitude toward the kind of art you want to make, you might find a way forward 🤷‍♂️  


As for your family, the people with the means to care for an ill loved one are the people who are responsible for their care. Your mental wellness is as much a resource as money is. If you run out, you can’t do it. Sounds like you’re running low on money and the ability to cope. Be honest about that with your family, and it’ll help later.

Most of the world is on your side. Especially those of us who have had similar experiences. Your recovery would be a big win for everyone.

It is not your fault any more than it would be your fault if you were hunted by a cheetah. Getting drugged is tough because the trust you have in that person isn’t dissolved when you wake up. What you know happened doesn’t square with what you think you know about that person.

I don’t know if there are more resilient people out there, but my experience is that it never goes back to square one after a rape. It’s better to move forward and grow than to get back to where you were before. (I’m a 30 YO guy) My pride was hurt, and I blamed myself a lot. I just wanted things to be normal again. It’s not something that happens to men, right? I didn’t take my pain seriously or place the blame where it belonged. Getting relief from the mental pain of rape started for me when I accepted that I wasn’t responsible. It’s only the rapist who makes the decision to commit the crime. I’ve been drugged because my friends thought it would be funny, and I’ve been drugged by a rapist. Both things are bad, but it kind of highlights that the intent to rape doesn’t come about because of the situation. It comes about because of the rapist.

Perspective is important. I wish I could be completely invisible while working out because I‘m kind of awkward, so working out at home is a preference.

depression,felxnar,t3_epm2ch,1579233537.0,"That’s uncanny. A similar thing happened to me, but the other way around. I was in a really low place, got dumped a few weeks before the wedding, and got hospitalized a little after that. Wrote my ex a letter before the break up was final (to me, anyway) explaining that I understand that my depression was hard on everyone but that I wanted to make things work. Gave it to her as she was packing her things, and all she had to say was “It is hard. That’s why this won’t work.”

It’s been a few years. The pain is manageable, but it’s still hard. The folks on here saying you dodged a bullet are right, but I know it’s hard to believe them. I still think my ex was hiding something she thought would be even more hurtful (and would make her look worse). She got pregnant awfully fast after the break up. 

My point is, that people are desperate to hide motivations that they find shameful, and misdirect others so they have to feel that shame instead. I’m not saying your ex cheated, but if he distanced himself in a way that puts you on the hook for anything material or emotional, he was putting you on the hook for it in his place. That’s dirty pool. You really did dodge a bullet.

If this is recent and you have anything shared between the two of you, protect yourself by changing any passwords or cancelling any accounts he has access to. It sucks because you can think ”things got rough, but I shared (insert personal information here) because they would never TRY to hurt me.” That may be true, but it’s also true that they don’t need any of your information any more. Some of my lowest moments were sitting on hold with a credit card company to explain that I didn’t know I had a credit card with them. It took $6000 and a year to move back out of my parent‘s house. Every step feels like the break up all over again. If it’s still early on, shut off everything he has access to before he can hurt you again.

On a more positive note, a lot of the world can open up after an experience like that. There may be people already in your life who have a trauma like yours that they’ve hidden, and they may be more comfortable opening up to you now. Some weird relationships might turn into good relationships because people will know you understand them. You might take a step you wouldn’t have otherwise because, fuck it. Why not? So many fears can feel so petty after the worst thing happens. It doesn’t take the pain or sadness away, but it can push the other side of the scale."

depression,f6zahx1,t3_dtpy4e,1573313481.0,"I don’t really want to die at the moment, but I understand the desire (because I still kind of welcome death). I don’t know if this is helpful information or not, but a lot of me wanting to die/commit suicide/ get killed was only half wanting to get everything over with. A big part of it was wanting to prove that I was really hurting and I needed to be taken seriously. My own mother laughed in my face when I first admitted I was depressed. OP, I don’t know if a person close to you is contributing to your depression, but be honest with yourself if they are. I had to hurt my mom so bad by leaving the house when I was a kid. Now we have a halfway decent relationship. The story is the same with a lot of my family, some of my friends, most everyone I know, and a lot of the pain is my fault. Still can’t forgive myself for some things, and it’s so terrible that I blame myself for things I didn’t have control over. The point is no one can know what their absence or presence amounts to. It can feel like it wouldn’t matter if you live or die. It can feel like it would be a good revenge to die. Please try to live and show love. That matters and you can measure it later. It’s not a cure, but it’s the right thing to do, and it’s a balm for the emptiness."
depression,f62e6pw,t3_dq6i9k,1572657869.0,"This one seemed to spark a lot of debate about the difference between wanting to die and not wanting to live, so I didn’t bother reading the whole thread. I don’t think there’s a way out or a cure or anything. There’s fascination, though. 

Take meditation. It’s boring and hokey, but if you really pay attention to what’s going on, it’s awe inspiring. The muscles contract to let the air in, the organs move, nerves fire, chemicals change, the organelles in your cells hurry to build or break molecules. 

There isn’t a single part of the world that isn’t as deep and simple as breathing. Fascination is a shield against despair. You can follow it down any path you like. Like cars? That’ll lead you to engineering and material science. Like sex? that could lead you to biology. (I’m very American, so those were the first two things that popped into my head.) Like books? Video games? Movies? Architecture? Cabinets? Soda? Road signs? Everything has an inexhaustible depth to it. 

I have a lot of reasons to be depressed, but there are only two reasons I don’t mind being alive: the people in my life, and fascination."
depression,f5aj757,t3_d3jfk6,1572108424.0,Yo dude. Following up on your therapist dying. You ok? Find another therapist?
depression,f4g1yze,t1_f4f6gzh,1571576747.0,"I would like to hear about it, if you don’t mind. I lost most of my friends a couple years ago. It really doesn’t stop hurting, but there are ways to deal with it. 

Btw. Don’t try to kill yourself. It’s a lot harder than you think it is, and frankly the world needs people who are sensitive enough to want it to be over. It’s a real catch, ain’t it? 

My parents suck, too. Give it a little while and they’ll let go a bit and you might even become friends with them. It takes time, though. My folks once told me that the only reason they kept me was to mow the lawn. My mom laughed at me when I told her I was depressed in high school. Now we talk about books. It’s worth forgiving them because they always thought they were doing the right thing, and they feel worse than I do about it."
depression,f4fzl50,t1_f4fcutu,1571576060.0,"You’re not a piece of shit. It’s ok to feel terrible. It’s not an ideal situation, but it’s really ok to feel bad. If someone is telling you things are ok when they aren’t, you need to go around them and get support. Parent, partner, sibling, it doesn’t matter. Go wide, get around, and get help. You’re in school. The most embarrassing and best thing I ever did was ask a teacher for help. It’s surprising how fast a teacher can put you in touch with a mental health professional, and it’s almost jarring to realize how much they care. 

And you know, advice is kind of a shitty thing to give. I just want you to know that you aren't a piece of shit. You’re a person and people care about you, even if the people you’re paying attention to don’t seem to."

Even a long drive you’ve made. Almost everything sucks, but whatever it is you can remember achieving doesn’t suck. Could be a really sweet paper airplane. You have something to give the world, and the world has a lot to give you. It doesn’t feel good to be alive, but I need you to stick around for a minute."
depression,f1seeeg,t3_dag7w9,1569727727.0,"As a slightly handsome man, I’ve seen partners slip away to people less attractive than me. Physical attractiveness only matters so much. Pro tip: don’t make anything the internet can make into an acronym a part of who you. It doesn’t help immediately, but try to be the sort of person you’re interested in being around. And don’t be too hard on yourself. And if you’ve experienced rejection, it isn’t because there’s some standard for people to always be accepted. It’s just not the right time most of the time. No reflection on you.

Shove the kisses and hugs out of your brain. Virginity is a myth. Take joy in people regardless of what you get out of relationships."
depression,f18gun1,t3_d84hm7,1569257586.0,"That’s great! Enjoy it and, if you don’t mind a little advice, appreciate the inevitable negative stuff. It’s all a chance to grow. You’ll find out you like stuff you didn’t know you liked! You’ll learn where you’re wrong about some things, and you’ll learn that someone you care about can be wrong and that’s ok! And if you avoid my example, you’ll learn that feeling miserable doesn’t mean you have to act that way towards the people you love! Oh, and try potted flowers as a gift if it won’t make a chore for her. A bouquet only last a few days, but flowers in soil make a project for you to take on together and give you something to talk about."

depression,f06av0g,t1_f04pq6y,1568433843.0,"Never had any experience with klonopin. Not sure if that’s something your GP needs input from a psychiatrist to keep your prescription or not. In my situation the GP could prescribe it without the psychiatrist, but preferred her input. Whatever the generic Zoloft is. In general, yes. Your GP can help, and it’s anxiety inducing to think that help might come in the form of a referral. 

The alcohol: listen. I drink too (and for the same reasons), but for the sake of everything worth living for, promise yourself you’ll eat and drink water before you ever take a sip of booze. Promise yourself that. Booze or not, actually. And keep the water handy while you’re drinking. I struggle with it. It’s the easiest way to avoid feelings i’d rather not have, but it’s also the easiest way to fall deeper into them. If you’re going to drink while depressed, be honest with yourself. It’s self-medicating. You shouldn’t be doing it. But if you do, take it with food and water like any other medication. Leaving your front door with a hang over is a little easier when your body hasn’t run through it’s last solid calorie. And leaving your front door is good for you, friend.  

And for god’s sake look up how your meds interact with alcohol. I’d do it for you because I care, but time is a little tight at the moment."
depression,f04aa1o,t3_d3jfk6,1568383198.0,"I started getting my anti depressants after a 5150, and my psychiatrist was saying she would have to up my prescription or stop giving it or whatever if I didn’t start going to therapy through her office. I couldn’t afford the money or the time to do it her way. I think she just wanted data points to make appointments shorter. You can get meds through your GP if you have one. Just don’t change doses or drop em without regular appointments to a psychiatrist. That’s a trip you don’t want to take. 

I’m so sorry for your loss. And for everyone else she was seeing. There aren’t enough people like that. The thing about people who do good work is that they make it simple to do right by them: Stay on track to keep growing. Doesn’t feel very simple, but it’s less complicated than what most of us are laying down for everyone else."

Your job is to accommodate the couple during the couple of days leading up to the wedding, and take responsibility for the stuff that can effect that time. Beyond that, you have one life. No one should be telling you and your partner whether or not you can do normal stuff. The extent of what other people can ask of you unless you’ve made a specific agreement is 1) Don’t do me a crime, bro. 2) try to make the world less like a hell, bro. 3) don’t make our specific agreement a hell, bro.

depression,esccwna,t3_c6zhez,1561826579.0,"Absolutely. It’s a compromise for sure. There are old friends I wonder about sometimes, but the reality is that it was relationship necromancy in the first place. I care about them, they care about me, but if we care about each other, why are we gobbling up each other’s time? If we need each other, we have our phones. If we don’t, then that’s good. 

It didn’t make me do more stuff. I’m not outside right now because I drank a bunch of beers last night alone in my apartment. It’s not going to solve your underlying problems. At least I can’t justify my particular problems by thinking “I didn’t do this because I was talking to so-and-so. And I only did this because so-and-so said this and I needed to get wasted and make a meme about it.” No. I’m just a depressed alcoholic who would rather be online than cleaning my apartment. I can work with that. 

A lot of my depression is from shame. I’ll probably be embarrassed just by commenting. The thing is that was constant for me when I had social media (facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, whatever dating sites I tried). Every interaction made me feel embarrassed and ashamed. Now I have a better grasp on being genuine with people in person, not presentational. I’m not furious with my family for being different from me politically, and we see each other more clearly. I’m not ashamed for failing to be an exemplar of the values I hold, or being the best at my hobbies. I don’t spend the time I save on social media in a great way, but for me it’s healthier to call a friend or read Wikipedia than it is to circle-jerk with people who share my opinions and internet fight with people who don’t. 

I’m procrastinating by writing this now. I should be writing music for a friend’s project. I wouldn’t have had that opportunity if I was still on social media because it required an in depth conversation with someone I would have only had a shallow, public facing conversation with if they didn’t have to call me to get in touch. 

If you’re relying on it for social contact, by all means, continue. If you have other means of engaging people, take a break. Btw.  Most of reddit is anti-social media. This sub is great, but this place is a board, not a social network."

Commiseration over different forms of self harm, suicidal ideation, and self loathing in general are fine. Plenty of people actually give a shit. More than a shit, really. I’ve attempted suicide, i’ve tried to rip my own skin off, and I’ve even tried to blackmail someone into killing me. Tell you what: nothing works like admitting to yourself that your brain is wrong on some level. People care. People are good 70% of the time. Hang around long enough to find the good ones. Worst case scenario, you’ll end up an old skeptic who helps an optimistic person find the truth. 

It hurts. Life hurts. In ways you can’t imagine. Doesn’t that mean you should keep it from hurting as bad for other people?"
