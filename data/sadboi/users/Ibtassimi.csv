Anxiety,fplf52f,t3_gdwcei,1588711601.0,I started getting that feeling this year (even tho I have been anxious pretty much my whole life). The fact that I've  been living alone for so many years may have made hearing the sound of any body else very annoying that I sometimes get those anxiety jumps. Same thing about the TV volume. I recommend trying to put earplugs on to reduce the volume instead of escaping the people around you and crying in the dark (which is what I still do sometimes :/...). Lowering the amount of light in the room also helped me a lot.
