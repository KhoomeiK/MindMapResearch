therapy,fjodhko,t3_fea426,1583525565.0,"You're alone man, my dad has threatened to kill me as well. I've had a similar situation to you. I'm Asian so personally I got beat a lot as a child and once my dad tried to chop my sisters hand off when she was in elementary school, it was very traumatizing and he's done many things close to that degree bordering insanity.  Idk how bad the abuse really is in your case but if I could give you any words of advice then I'd say to not fuel your dad's anger as hard as it may be. If he is that unstable it's not worth the risk. Don't lose yourself in the process and remember what you stand for but don't get hurt and stay safe."

depression,fj2pa8v,t1_fj2p1oh,1582949785.0,"Could you describe what it is you want? I believe I have been in your dilemma before, it was only till not too long ago that I made a break through in my social life. I've been bullied throughout most of my childhood so I became very reserved. Maybe I could give some insight."
depression,fj2b1bj,t3_fb0wr8,1582939085.0,"I think this is a bit contradictory. To believe that you will be lonely forever and that you're not ok with that shows me that you've got some things to sort out, and that's ok. But until you do sort things out, I wouldn't worry about it. It's all part of the process and even if you feel like shit, keep trucking through life. You'd be surprised how many ""problems"" just vanish when you have confidence, forgive yourself, and start being ok failing. Best of luck."

If you are so worried about your parents finding out about you trying to kill yourself then don't kill yourself. Don't think about why you wanna kill yourself, allow yourself to be happy. Best of wishes."

depression,fik231y,t1_figndle,1582470878.0,"Yeah, it's kinda like that tbh. This person isn't like my significant other or anything but we had so many good talks and cared so much about each other but I couldn't look deeper into myself and admit it was more than that. 

So now i'm just worried a lot, because I physically cannot go and see her, and she just completely cut herself off from social media or whatever is going on."

depression,fczv02j,t1_fcyvdg8,1578109074.0,"Ahh, definitely a valid concern. I'm certainly not an expert on this topic but i've read numerous books from having the same issue. From my experience I would say that it's important to constantly understand why you do what you do and how that action serves your life. Eating bad for example I would go like ""I am eating this because it tastes good, this is going to make me feel tired, sluggish, unhappy, ect."" For working out you could say to yourself ""I could be working out, but instead I choose to do (X) right now. It doesn't take that much time, just give yourself maybe a minute each negative option you choose and genuinely evaluate if it's what you want, because in the end it really is all about what YOU want. Do YOU want what you want enough to make a sacrifice or compensate.

If you're not satisfied i'd highly recommend the book ""Atomic Habits by James Clear"", it's the only book you'll ever need about developing and removing habits."
