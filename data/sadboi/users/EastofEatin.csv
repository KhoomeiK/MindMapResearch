The lay-person with no healthcare knowledge will most likely think that doctors know all about medications, medical conditions, and how to treat those medical conditions. Alternatively they may think that nurses just *give* the medications and follow whatever the doctor tells them to do. Unless a person has been hospitalized, they really do not understand the scope of medicine or nursing, and I can't say I blame them.


When I was in nursing school and started clinicals my family was shocked to find out I had to perform bed-baths and help patients when they had to use the bathroom. They were surprised when I explained my duties to them, and to this day still question what I do. Sometimes a simple explanation of what you *actually* do in a day can help."
