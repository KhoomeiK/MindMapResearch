AMA,fmcemjc,t1_fmc6ey9,1585944189.0,"So in my apparently very controversial opinion, I believe the vulnerable populations such as the elderly and immunocompromised should be quarantined or self quarantine, while those who are not in the vulnerable populations continue living somewhat normally. I say somewhat because I don’t believe that public events and festivals should be able to continue, those can be public health hazards, nor do I believe gatherings of over say 15-20 people should be allowed. I also believe school should go online until the curve peak is reached. But, I still believe that restaurants, grocery stores, parks, bars, cinemas, bodegas (I’m from New York sorry) and other ‘normal life’ places should remain open. I also believe that shelter in place ordinances or travel bans should not even remotely be considered, the only way to combat this until a vaccine is created is by the non-vulnerable populations gaining herd immunity.

If we were dealing with Ebola (has a 50% mortality rate) I would say that this strategy would be impossible, but the coronavirus only has a 1-2% mortality rate. This is not a negligible mortality rate, but small enough to where 98-99% of the worlds population can survive the virus, albeit with much difficulty, and become immune to the current strain. Socially distancing will just make people suffer more with mental and physical health problems due to the quarantine (for example: I have colitis and cannot seek treatment at a doctor’s office for this because the doctor like everyone else is socially distancing), and draw out a problem that is serious. Finally, I don’t feel like it is not deadly at all, but the death rate is 1-2% in my predictions. People in the media act like this is AIDS, and when a celebrity gets it they will die for sure, which medically speaking is false."

Over 80% of people who get it do not require hospitalization, even more don’t require ventilation. Over 50% of people who have the virus do not have any symptoms throughout the time they have the virus.
