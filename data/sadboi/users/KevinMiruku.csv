Anime in Japan is short for animation. Outside of Japan ""anime"" means Japanese animation. This would always bring out the weeb rage. Lol

Now I'm guessing there are two types of weebs, though I'm use to it when it meant someone who gets butthurt cause of mispronouncing ""manga"" with a strong ""Ay"" sound. And when they yell out for calling something that they don't see as ""anime"" or mad cause you don't like something they're a big fan of and thinks ridiculing and bitching at them is helping out the community. It's not, so please stop if you're doing this.
I'm guessing ""weebs"" turned more into ""anime/manga/japanese knowledge"". Though haters use it as a ""wannabe japanese"". I was use to ""wapanzee"" back in my day. Lol 

In japan and other asian areas ""Otaku"" is also used for ""anime/manga nerds"" though in Japan it's also used as one who's a collector or has knowledge over a certain thing/s.

Some places being an Otaku is frowned upon when used in a disrespectful way by others. Kinda like the word ""weeb"".

My mother and father were never together. She has my step dad who when I turned 18 and started getting a check once every other month of a lot of money for some reason, my step dad told me I had to put that into my bank account and take a chunk out and give it to him in cash. You know, to pay him back for taking care of me. Yay... Looking back on all that pisses me off. I wish nothing more that to get out an never see any of them. Ah. And I don't like my father either. He turned out to be just as heartless as my step father. The racist type who hates immigrants, but yet he's going around other countries getting women pregnant and bailing. Sure. Gtfo. Only reason he knew of me cause my mother tracked his ass down for child support. Which also shows that in the end she kept me around for money. That money went to my little brother, who is my step fathers son. It hurts so much not seeing how it really was. I always thought she at least loved me a little if she kept me around. I was so wrong. Somewhere when my brother was born, I was the sample that got thrown out. Sucks, but fuck em.
