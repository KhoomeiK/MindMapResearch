I don’t use the email address I signed up with and think it’s been compromised. When I was setting up my phone a year ago it asked for an email address I didn’t recognise, from a Chinese domain. Now today it told me my Apple ID was locked for some reason. I checked and there were two Macs registered to my device, one with some Chinese characters before it. I got into the email I used to sign up and saw emails from Apple about a MacBook registered in the Western Sahara in July!

So now I’ve changed my Apple ID email and password, but I’m worried. All my passwords are in my notes, what’s to stop them from just getting back in?"

The thing is, I told him pretty much what you said. But he’s the one that told me he’s in love with me first, reassured me that he cares for me as much as I care for him. I barely saw him, but when I did I felt like a different person... now it all just feels like a dream. I wanted to believe him, and when I saw him last he told me he does care about me, me considering I could be dead for all he knows I find it really hard to believe.

Honestly, I don’t know. With him it started as a hook up, I don’t know how to find guys other than that, and I can’t go back to that.

I travelled 10 miles and waited hours in the cold and he didn't even bother to tell me he couldn't make it. He really thinks I'm an idiot, and I am because I never say anything about these lame excuses. And, oh yeah, he asked for a loan of £80 right after he agreed to go out (of course I said yes even though I'm broke too) - guessing that's the only reason he said yes and never actually planned to meet me.

I'm really sorry to hear that :( Ghosting is the worst, it's happened to me and I just hate that you don't get any sense of closure because I kept thinking, if only I could talk to him and convince him...

depression,ez5ubxc,t3_d03jkj,1567705272.0,"Us gays love a Britney reference huh ;)

I know what you mean. I don’t want to say it to anybody because I don’t want to sound like I love being oppressed or whatever. But it’s extremely true that you never stop “coming out”. I don’t know why people find it so freeing, I don’t have that feeling at all. It feels like I’ll never be “normal”. I don’t know how to describe it"
depression,ez5tv3d,t3_d03sty,1567705036.0,"This is exactly the way I feel. Why am I like this! I was really smart as a kid, I swear 8 year old me is smarter than 19 year old me. Just how can I be so dumb"

DreamInterpretation,eyqn5pr,t1_eyqje0j,1567348300.0,"Yeah, the dates definitely seemed significant. I'm constantly amazed by how much meaning dreams can have!

Thank you! I know exactly what you mean, sometimes I just stay in bed all day and stay up all night, which I kinda did all summer and it just flew by. The first thing I thought of though was that I'm spending a bit more time away from home, I started staying over with my boyfriend which my parents are making me feel really guilty about (like I'm not 19 years old lol) because I'm spending less time with them. In the dream I was also kind of annoyed that nobody bothered to check up on me to wake me up. I don't know if that means anything though"
askgaybros,eymbfhs,t1_eyizc1w,1567204401.0,"I know what you mean. But in my case I don’t think of it at all as him being a “daddy”, he really looks like he’s in his early 20s (good genes). So I know what you mean and you see it, particularly in the gay community, all the time, but in our case it’s just not like that

And I don’t think it’s fair to judge somebody like that. He is very successful, he owns his own house, when I was at uni a large percentage of my classmates were over 30. I just think it’s nice that we can relate on that level, we both have coursework and all that. I almost ended up on the same course as him before we even knew each other lol, it’s fate!"
depression,eyj252i,t3_cx1lg7,1567111232.0,"Exactly how I feel. I just started a new course but my social anxiety is WAY too bad to be able to handle this, even though it’s exactly what I love. I feel intimidated by the people who act like they know more about it. It seems being loud and wrong is the way to go, it doesn’t matter if you’re wrong just as long as you’re by loud, and I literally can’t do it. Nobody talks to me. I tried. They don’t want to know me, so I sit alone in the bathroom at lunch acting like I don’t exist because I don’t want everybody to see me sitting alone as if it’s school all over again

Thinking about growing up, getting a job, dealing with people everyday... it’s at the point where I feel like it’s not worth it. I’m really starting to feel like I’d rather be dead. I’m scared my boyfriend will leave me in the future because I won’t be able to get a good job. I’ll have nobody. I don’t know what to do"
askgaybros,eyijyi9,t1_eyiiixt,1567103464.0,"Well, age is a funny thing isn’t it? It’s subjective. I don’t believe in that theory that you’re supposed to act a certain way or achieved a certain thing based on how long you’ve been on earth. I’m not putting that pressure on myself and I’m sure as hell not putting it on anybody else. We’re here at the same time, we like each other, there’s nothing stopping us"
askgaybros,eyigawq,t1_eyiaptg,1567102068.0,What did your parents say about it?
askgaybros,eyifghu,t1_eyidoen,1567101744.0,"Thank you! :) I don’t care thankfully, I was just curious. I would never limit myself to people my age, I don’t rule anything out but I just don’t think I could keep up with somebody under 25 lol. You’re right, it’s really special, and we both want it. I’m happy :)"
askgaybros,eyid0at,t1_eyicah3,1567100705.0,"So... we’re not supposed to be together because we might break up? I’m not saying we’re getting married or anything. I know the vast majority of couples break up, although I really hope it never comes to that, why would I worry about that when it would probably happen anyway?

I’m not into partying or anything, I have no interest in the stuff most people my age do, so actually it helps that I’m not with someone my age who wants to do all of that stuff"
askgaybros,eyibg5o,t1_eyiaoiq,1567100096.0,"Lmao. Ok!

No it’s not equal, he has more life experience than me and I’m learning a lot from him. We both like it that way. What is wrong with that? Who ever said that you had to be exactly at the same life stage as your partner? You don’t refuse to be friends with coworkers older than you, do you?"
askgaybros,eyib25c,t1_eyia09k,1567099956.0,Well yes I’ve thought about it but I can’t live my life thinking that negatively. How do we even know when or if either of us will retire!? It’s a risk I’m willing to take

I already turned him down so many times because I knew what my family would be like, but I finally said fuck it and didn't go home that night. And my family might never look at me the same way again, but it was worth it!"
AmItheAsshole,eycs35o,t1_eycr0bm,1567006144.0,"At least doing drugs is a masculine activity to them lol. When I was a kid it was a nightmare. I was more into music than football (heaven forbid), and they did everything in their power to try to manipulate me into liking it, because ""all the boys do"". I got in deeeeep trouble because I wanted to be a girl when I was a kid. They bullied it out of me, so now I just have no interests or personality lol. So I hope people can see why under no circumstances do I ever wanna admit this to them. They don't see why they're so toxic. They laughed when I said a year ago I want to move out"
AmItheAsshole,eycqgus,t1_eycpg0p,1567005513.0,"1. Yes
2. I pay rent
3. No official rules but if there were I'm pretty sure ""don't be gay"" would be on there
4. I lied it about it for obvious reasons. They hate gays. Even if they don't, it's not a chance I'm willing to take. I'm not going to tell them I'm out with a man. I want some semblance of privacy now that I'm beginning to date finally. I let them know I'm safe and I hoped that would be the end of it, but no. If I took my toothbrush, what do they think I'm doing that's so bad?"
AmItheAsshole,eycq0qo,t1_eycot1k,1567005340.0,"I'm not ""out"" (for obvious reasons lol), but yes, I think they do. My interests are very ""gay"", I never showed an interest in girls, deep down they know. That's why they're so afraid, they would rather I was depressed holed up in my room like I have been for years or out doing drugs than gay"
AmItheAsshole,eycpo7a,t1_eycolgz,1567005206.0,"No and I refuse to. They don't need to know every detail of my private life. Yes I told a white lie. Why did they even notice my toothbrush was gone, does that sound normal? They analyse everything and it's lead to me having extreme anxiety as an adult (ha, legally at least). I'll just reiterate, they know when I stay out late (with the guy I'm seeing), I don't come home drunk or high or covered in blood or anything. They know I'm safe. I'm 19. Don't you think they should respect my privacy enough to leave it at that?"
AmItheAsshole,eycnhk6,t1_eycmz1r,1567004391.0,"Don't let them stop you. My parents would definitely prefer I stayed depressed, alone and locked in my room for the rest of my life than be gay, but I won't have that lol"
