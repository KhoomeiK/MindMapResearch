In this talk, Ken Gemes introduces Nietzsche as the
philosopher of the death of God. Nietzsche claims that we have not yet fully understood the ramifications of the
modern rejection of belief in God. Giving up the belief in
God undermines all our values, though many cling to those
values in the absence of God or any other justificatory
basis for those values. When we truly appreciate the meaning of the death of God, we will, says Nietzsche, lapse into nihilism; the inability to find any foundation for values
and meaning in the world. This Nietzsche presciently predicts as the future of Europe for the next two hundred years. Nietzsche does not endorse nihilism but seeks to move beyond it to a new affirmation of this world, the only world there is. But what does Nietzsche mean exactly by nihilism?"
