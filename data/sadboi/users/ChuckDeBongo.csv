FA30plus,f4uo4vw,t3_dlw3zo,1571820522.0,"I can’t speak for anyone else, but my reasons for being FA is twofold.

1. I’m ugly. Whatever people say, it isn’t about personality. It’s about being good looking. Anything else is a bonus. If none wants to look at me, then I can’t progress any further.
2. I’m too practical. I love facts and figures and there’s no “soul” behind me. And I realise that can be a turn off. As scientists, it infuriates me to hear women (thought men can be guilty of this) say stuff like “I’m such a nerd! I love science! I’m such a nerd!” (While wearing glasses), but when I give them real science (debunking popular tropes, peer reviewed science, etc) I see their eyes glaze over. They don’t actually “love” science, they just like bite sized science facts (of dubious veracity). Just another thing in society we’re trying to simplify.

In conclusion, being FA (I’m 40) is tough and there’s many reasons as to why one is FA. But just remember one thing, it’s not all your fault. People are superficial swines...."
FA30plus,f4tdw3b,t3_dlq2y4,1571787190.0,"You’ve articulated better what I’ve been trying to say for ages. This is a game we FAers can’t win. It’s rigged against us. We’re not good looking. We’re ugly. That’s why life is harder for us. All of our idiosyncrasies and faults can be reasoned away if you’re good looking. Otherwise, we’re just vermin. So, screw them and do what we want to do. If we’re genuinely married to the idea we’re going to die alone, they’re you’re free! Free to do what you want as the end result will still be the same. Being alone. But at least you’ll have done what you wanted to do. As opposed to sit around waiting for a miracle to happen.

I already have my way of making a dent in the world. It’ll take some work and there’s a possibility it may fail, but I’m going to give it everything I have. I want more FAers to rise up and take their lives by the horns. It’s YOUR life! Own it! Mould it! Craft it! Turn it into something you want. The world has rejected you. So reject it back."

She has to want be with me. In a relationship, all I need is reassurance she’s happy with me and I’m a laid back kind of person. But who actually knows? Everyone thinks they’d be perfect in a relationship, but the truth is somewhat more honest....."
ForeverAlone,f4phvw9,t3_dl9ze9,1571731480.0,"I totally agree, man. Some people are the pigeons and some people are the statue. Try as we might to be normal functioning members of society, others will try their utmost to cut you down in the name of making themselves feel better.....and there’s nothing we can do about it. It’s all our fault. We’re creeps, we’re anti social, we’re weirdos (pick your pejorative). Apparently, it’s all of our own doing. Unless you’re a female, then suddenly, you’ll get all the sympathy in the world. 

Now, I’m not saying females don’t have their own crosses to bear and anyone who says otherwise is living in cloud cuckoo land. But how come we’re totally responsible for others harassing us? When was this an acceptable form of victim blaming? And does any of this make you more attractive to the gender you find attractive? Hell no! 

For the record, some people don’t help themselves! But they still can live their life how they see fit. But the truth is we’re ugly. I hate to break it to you but if you’re treated like this, you’re ugly. Which makes all your traits and idiosyncrasies ugly. If you were good looking? Then suddenly all your traits and idiosyncrasies become “quirks” and “foibles”. They’re now socially acceptable and, dare I say it? A bit cute! It’s all rubbish. 

Just do you. Save money, take pride in your job, keep a tidy home, try to exercise more. Be the best you can be. And don’t do it to get people off your back. Do it to make yourself feel better. As awful as people picking on us is, we do need to do our part for our own good.

The only joy I get from just working is all the money and wealth I save.

You’ve gotta play the game you need to get what you want. Sometimes that means being honest and sometimes it means being “unethical” (shall we say?). I’m 40 and cannot work out relationships. I’m successful in pretty much everything I’ve done (in the most humble way I can say that!) but connecting with other human beings is something I can’t do.
