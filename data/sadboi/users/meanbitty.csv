WhitePeopleTwitter,fh1ncs7,t1_fh1kr1b,1581218782.0,"I spent so long playing Skyrim that real life turned into it for a while. I live near an Air Force base, and one day a low flying jet in my peripheral vision resembled a dragon and prompted me to reach for my bow. Except I donâ€™t own a bow. I had the same thing happen with my current obsession, The Long Dark. Every time I hear crows I think thereâ€™s something dead nearby that I can loot."

Like curve-hugging jeans, sexy sweaters, and tailored blouses. Once upon a time, Victoriaâ€™s Secret taught young women how to look like women. Now they basically tell you itâ€™s ok to live in your pajamas and stop brushing your hair. We went from classy, well dressed young women to college slumber party."

In addition to the psych meds, I also have PCOS and a generic predisposition to weight gain. The metformin has helped. Itâ€™s slow, but working. Iâ€™m down 11lbs in 3 months."
