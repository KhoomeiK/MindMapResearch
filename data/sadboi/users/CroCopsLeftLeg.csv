Fair point but Ngannou still has far better technique than Hafthor and has a considerable speed and experience advantage. I'd put money on Ngannou any day of the week against him.

Look at guys like Bob Sapp and Hong Man Choi. All that size and strength means nothing if you don't know how to use it.

If I remember correctly the response to the Romero fight was mixed. Everyone agreed that it was boring af but the opinion was divided between whether Izzy fought a smart fight or that it was razor close and he should have done more to 'solidify' his win.

Personally I thought he fought a smart fight but whenever he engaged Romero would catch him. I think Costa is going to give him a really hard time when he puts the pressure on.
