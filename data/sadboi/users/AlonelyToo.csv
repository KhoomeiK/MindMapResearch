depression,fkgpef6,t1_fkazc4n,1584168165.0,"I feel that too.. I want to move back to the city, I want to get a well–paying job that means something, and some pets. I want to live alone with those pets until I find someone special who treats me well. Actually, being about 25 again would pretty much cover all the bases. (No, really. I mean that.) I want a family that has actual conversations, and asks or tells we to do something, instead of skipping straight to the being mad because i haven’t already done it, even if I didn’t know I was supposed to. I want better self-esteem. I want to eat more healthy food. I want a new car because mine is kind of embarrassing to be seen in. I want a reason to get out of bed in the morning. I want to feel like and act like an adult. Most of all I want a baby,  but I’m past the sale-by date on that one, so there’ another reason to be 25 again. 

But none of those things are going to happen unless I put some hard work into it. (Well, the 25–again thing is impossible.) And honestly, I’m too far down right now to be able to figure out what I need to do to get out of bed and to work on time tomorrow, so I’m probably too far down to accomplish anything, and I don’t see that changing for the rest of my life. I will soon have to take care of my mother, she won’t tolerate pets and hates the city. I won’t be finding a well-paying job out here in the middle of cow pastures either. My mother  never talks to me without an edge in her voice. Never mind that there are certain things she’s said to me over the past few years that broke my heart bit by bit and which I’ll never forget. But Its like I’m chained to her now that she’s a widow and there is no other family left. 

I’ve been down before, and one magical day the meds started working and I felt a little better, and so on. But even then I wasn’t able to be everything I wanted to be. It’s kind of like when you lose weight and get healthy, but it turns you still feel the same way you did, but you’re more tired now.

Then again the song is called “All you need is love” and that’s a big lie too, because I’m here to tell you that you also need money and food and friends and …

I’m trying but failing to say that sometimes I’ve gotten the things I wanted, and it turned out not to change my life after all. I don’t know if I was wrong about what I wanted, or if I was equating what I wanted with what I needed, focusing on the former when I should have been focused on the later.

(However, I think this one’s on her. She is old enough and ought to be mature enough to look at the contents of what she’s putting on her body and avoid strawberries. If she were allergic to chocolate but took a brownie out of the fridge and ate it, that’s her mistake because *of course* a brownie is chocolate.

They consider different genders sharing a bedroom after a certain age (I think it’s 12, but it might be 10) highly inappropriate and unhealthy as children approach sexual maturity. 

I think all of you need some family counseling or the future is going to be hell. If this situation goes on as it is, there will always be resentment between your husband’s kids and you, and between your husband’s kids and your daughter. And probably eventually between your daughter and your husband. 

Blending families is not easy, and a few sessions with a family therapist should help establish communication channels, General expectations, and probably help the kids understand each other better and give your husband’s children a safe place to discuss how they feel about their mother’s death and your place in the “new normal” family. 

Saying this as the kid who always got picked on and felt ganged up on by the step-siblings,  who of course already knew each other, and in my case there are definitely some remaining issues stemming from how I never felt like I was invited to be part of “their” family.  I am just now, after his death, learning how my uncertainty about my role in the family changed the relationship I could have had with my stepdad into a pit of quicksand.

([Tennyson](https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/red-in-tooth-and-claw.html), kind of, if you were wondering.) Cats are much closer to integration in the natural world than dogs are, i guess. 

Somebody already mentioned “working cats” on farms (I can’t find the comment anymore), but they also “work” in warehouses, feed mills, basically anywhere you don’t want vermin. Barn cats especially have free run of the outdoors and the barn to keep rodents out of hay, the feed purchased for a horse, the farm house, etc.

When the cat population gets too high, however, the cats themselves become vermin. Which is what’s happened in Australia I think, and also I guess what happened years and years ago with rabbits there. 

Says the Redditor who has named every one of the almost 20 barn cats who live here. Some of them are very prolific mousers, while others wouldn’t eat a mouse brought to them on a silver platter. I‘m pretty sure they all learn how to catch mice as kittens and they love them as toys, though. 

I’d be very interested to see statistics comparing the number of kills for a rural versus urban or suburban cat, since the numbers chalked up by suburban cats were higher than I thought they would be. Our cats seem really lazy and nap in the sun most of the day, so I wonder if they really catch more than their urban counterparts, even though availability should be higher here.

[Editing to add:] Then there are voles, which look almost exactly like mice but have pointier snouts, and which apparently taste revolting to cats, so they just leave them where they kill them. I’m not sure if the cat can tell the difference between a mouse and a vole until it gets a taste, though."

That (breakdown posts with pictures) is what I thought OP was referring to when talking about things they hate. I’m sometimes grateful for people who post about their symptoms or the thinking/feeling traps and loops their depression or anxiety gets them stuck in, because sometimes I’ve had the exact same thoughts and it really is good to know I’m not alone. 

You can talk all you want about how you’re feeling, and I will be empathetic, but there are two things that will confuse me: 

1.  Posting pictures of yourself so upset. Something about it feels off to me, and I think this is why: If someone else took and posted pictures of you every time you got upset and cried, I would find that very exploitive. Just because you took the pictures of yourself doesn’t keep me from being suspicious of your motives. Do you think that without pictures I won’t believe you?  Is that a subtle hint that I shouldn’t believe you? Are you making your emotional problems into your identity, and then living off that? I feel like I’m being manipulated, although I can’t figure out what you’re trying to get out of me. 

2.  Stop posting about the same situation/feelings/problem/issues for 10 days in a row. If you haven’t found what:you were looking for by posting the first four or five times, it’s unlikely that you’ll get different results the next five times. If something is so traumatic for you, you need to take steps to talk to a mental health professional instead of random people online, because we clearly can’t help, and we can’t make a psychiatric or psychological appointment for you. Eventually, you have to boss up and take those first steps for yourself. 

(My mother is terrible about this. Not in online posts, just in everyday life. Every other day, she tells me about something awful, using almost the same words every time. It really bothers me, and I want to help, but since she refuses to seek help from a therapist or even do any kind of self-care on her own, I’m kind of done hearing about it. Don’t just keep telling me, because if that helped you’d feel better by now. Besides, she raised me and she knows that her MDD and GAD were passed on down to me, so honestly, I’m just as clueless as she is.)

FYI, I worked in a mental health practice for years as the person who answered the phone. So when you worked up the nerve to call, I was the person you talked to and who scheduled your first appointment. I know it feels scary, but for the person on the other end of the phone call, it’s another day at work. If you want to talk to me about it, I’ll help you figure out exactly what to say and what to expect to hear. I will honestly be happy to help you with it."

I work for a psychiatrist and his wife as a joint personal assistant. I don’t get paid very much. 

It’s been a bad three or four months for my entire family. At one point in January the fam were all on my back trying to tell me I needed to get a better-paying job. No matter how many times I explained that I wasn’t likely to make it past the first step if I cried throughout the interview, they didn’t get it. 

Doctor Boss noticed I wasn’t coping well, told me about it, and suggested that I needed to take some time off to get myself together a little better. (I respect his professional judgment quite a lot, so I did what he suggested.)

Family was giving me grief about why wasn’t I going to work, did I think I could just sit around doing nothing or sleeping all day, I had to work like everyone else. So finally I told them word for word what he said., and they left me alone about it. 

Then about three weeks later when I was back at work I had a stress-induced episode of vertigo so bad that I truly could not walk much less drive, had double-vision and auditory hallucinations and a roaring in my ears — which are apparently symptoms of vertigo that I was unaware of — and have now been out of work for pretty much all of February because only in the past few days have I been able to see clearly enough to trust myself to drive.

Because anytime you leave a girl you’re  serious about somewhere crying, YTA. You need to spend a little time talking her down, telling her you’re sad that things didn’t work out the way she had hoped (not your fault, but that’s not the point here), and that you still love her. Once she’s calmed down a little you can go downstairs. (Tell her you can’t just leave your buddies sitting there and you feel like you need to go down. Ask if she wants to go with you, of course. Tell her the two of you will do something special tomorrow.)

Doctor’s appointment on the 19th with PCP. I don’t think she’ll be able to tell me much since I don’t have the money for an MRI. I may found somewhere that is over $1000 cheaper but now I wonder if I should get it now or wait until I’ve seen a specialist?"
AmItheAsshole,fhdiszx,t3_f220xc,1581487708.0,"NTA. In fact, it must have taken a lot of courage to confront her about it. You’re probably not the only one who noticed, but it sounds like you’re the only one who spoke up.  You were risking the friendship (who knows, give her some time) to push her in the right direction. She might need a big oil’ shove to get moving but at least you know you have told her that her son needs her too..Everybody who is deep in a valley has a turning point and maybe you’ll wind up helping her find her’s.

A lot of the posts here mention going or getting “through her grief.” I think that’s the problem – she doesn’t want to get through it, she wants to wallow in it. Maybe she enjoyed the attention she got when her loss first happened. Maybe she’s scared she wouldn’t have enough things to do to fill up her day and is  ... I don’t know what. Something has to change for her son’s sake, and it sounds like it’s getting to the point where if she doesn’t take care of it now, she will have to do it in those always unsettled adolescent years. 

I’m sure the 5-year-old isn’t the only thing she’s neglected. We know she’s neglected her friendships. How about her marriage?  She probably doesn’t want to come out of her fog to find everything else has fallen apart.

Anyway my plan to try a workout this afternoon fell apart when I stood up to get some water and screamed a little bIt because of how it hurt. 

I often sit with my legs crossed yoga style. I  bet I need to stop doing that. 

Off to dig around for the ebooks!"

TV & movies were never something I was that into. I usually work late so I can only watch if I remember to DVR it or it’s On Demand. I also have Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and I’m more likely to watch something from one of those services. But when there’s YouTube and TikTok and a million other things, does anyone really watch TV?

I an almost embarrassed to tell you how much I like Post Malone and Billie Ellish. (I feel like I’m way too old to like them. But I thought the same thing about Lady Gaga, and I was wrong then, so …)  About a year ago I went through a Country Trap phase. 

I don’t feel like music has passed me by, but I will say that a few years ago I gave a friend a ride home, and when Uptown Funk came on she asked me all about b/c her 10-year-old son wanted to listen to it and she wouldn’t let him. So she was definitely out of touch, and she was at least 10 years younger than me. 

I could give you a long list of artists or bands I like, but if that’s what you wanted I would just screenshot my Spotify playlist. It would include Lewis Capaldi, Lizzo, Pink, Maroon 5, Hozier, Khalid, Twenty One Pilots, Disturbed, Halsey, Drive by Truckers, Panic! At The Disco, Drake, Kings of Leon, Imagine Dragons, Nicki Minaj, and I’ll stop there. 

The only problem I have with Country music is that at least 25% of the songs are so sad that I can either change what’s playing or start crying and hope I’ve stopped by the time I get where I’m going. But I love Miranda Lambert and the Pistol Annies. I also like Kasey Muskgraves a lot. New found appreciation for Vince Gill as a master guitar player too. 

There are only two types of music I won’t listen to: square-dancing style bluegrass and bubblegum pop songs that all sound the same. 

There are a lot of podcasts that I try and fail to keep up with, and I don’t think Spotify does a very good job on new music discovery, so there’s a lot of music I just don’t get around to hearing. I’m sure there is a lot out there that I would really like (especially in the Rock genre), but just don’t know about and/or don’t have time to investigate. 

If I have kids in the car with me, I have to impose some language and subject-matter rules, so some songs I never hear, even from a favorite artist. 

Edited to add: I’ve been lucky, and I look maybe 20 years younger than I am, especially on the weekend when I’m wearing athletic clothes and have my hair back in a ponytail. Usually. Apparently in the past few weeks I have developed sciatica and at times can barely walk without hunching over in pain. I would guess that’s probably a dead five-away.

TrueOffMyChest,fhasn8g,t1_fhaom7t,1581425727.0,"Yes. My dad killed himself when I was 7, almost 8. No matter how bad things get, I just can’t do that to my mom again.

If the heat rose to over 85 degrees in the classroom we were allowed to have drinks. We didn’t have access to drink machines though. You gave your teacher the money and told them what you wanted.  I guess if you had a cup you could have gotten water from the water fountain. (I didn’t mind not having beverages in class, because the bathrooms were so crowded I was glad to cut down on my number of visits.)

They also had to send students home for the day if the classroom temperature got higher than 87. (I think that’s the number.) Like a snow day, but for the heat. 

To the point, you are NTA!  You followed the school’s stated procedure. If a teacher doesn’t like it, they should talk to the principal or whoever decided that’s how it would work."
JUSTNOFAMILY,ff6gq59,t3_eroke7,1579626833.0,"I’m wondering if you need to become his fiduciary guardian. He’s going to be very naive once he has money and the opportunity to spend it, and fall for a lot of stuff, like those poor foreign princes who just can’t get their money out of their country. (I’ve seen it happen to uneducated people who are quite intelligent but have been isolated and don’t know much about the real world.)

Also, call the Dept.of Social Services in your city. There may be money set aside for people without insurance to access for mental health care specifically. They should be able to get a therapist, but first will need to do an initial visit to create a CCA (comprehensive clinical assessment), which is a basic patient history, a preliminary diagnosis (which insurance or the state indigent fund will need so they can treat him) and at least some direction for the next step. DSS might be able to help with a social security number as well, DSS may be able to help find his social security. Sometimes requests from a social worker get moved on faster because it’s for “somebody in the business” so to speak. 

Note: The therapist, etc that they hook you up with may not be the best in town. Until you can get insurance straightened out for him, you will probably have to work with who you get. (Even with health insurance it won’t be easy, because getting mental health coverage arranged is a bear no matter what.)

Although it doesn’t sound like he is learning impaired from your description, your area definitely has some learn-to-adult and learn-to-work programs that would help him. They are usually for people who learn slowly and need lots of repetition, which isn’t necessarily him, but i think it’s the right information for what he needs. 

If you find the right person or organization trying to get him into a program they will bend over backwards to arrange a personalized learning plan for him that might also include high school or GED classes. It’s within the realm of possibility they will set him up for a first job and work with him as a job coach to help him understand what he is supposed to do and how he is supposed to do it. 

Oh, one more tip from teaching teens how to do laundry. If you can find them, get the things that look like dryer sheets that include soap, softener and then the sheet is also a dryer sheet. Then get some of the sheets from Shout (I think) that keep clothes from fading on each other. Both of these things really work and that way he really won’t even have to sort laundry at first."

techsupport,fepw70k,t3_eq8497,1579333462.0,"Log in. Umm. About that... The reason this has surfaced is because my Dad passed asay Dec 1. He had written down all his passwords to us, but we can't read what he wrote for AT&T. They were happy enough to set up automatic withdrawals from my Mom’s bank account. The representative on the phone apparently told bounced her call about all over the place, and ultimately told  Mom that she could not change the account owner name or change the email address that they send alerts to without someone seeing the death certificate. 

She was told to bring a copy of the death certificate to a store and they would call some number and get that taken care of. When she brought the death certificate in, the staff at that location said they had never heard of such a thing and definitely didn't know what number to call.

I can't understand why getting this done is so confusing to AT&T staff. She talked to 5 or 6 people before she found the person who told her to bring the death certificate. 

Come on, people. Direct TV/AT&T is a huge company, and  statistically they must have a few customers die every single day. You'd think they had set up an easy way to transition the account and made it clear to all staff how to execute it."
nextfuckinglevel,fag49vf,t1_faerdos,1576039755.0,"Even if you have a farm, you’ve got to watch what working herding dogs get up to. It’s been over 30 years (God, how did THAT happen) but my dad used to have a pair of Blue Heelers to help with our 70-head herd of Black Angus. One of them was great, the other wasn’t quite as enthusiastic – meaning she would lie down for a few minutes every now and then. They got long walks and runs every day when they went out to “help” check the cows and the fences, but even that wasn’t always enough. 

A bored working dog … works. So they (Fancy and Elvira) would go out and herd cattle all on their own. The problem with that is they don’t know when enough is enough, and will sometimes try to “herd” a young calf and keep it running until it actually dies of exhaustion. Mama cow is usually making enough noise about it that a human is likely to hear it and call the dogs off, but that’s the kind of energy these dogs have. And they are smarter than most dogs and probably even some humans. I cannot imagine them as indoor dogs. (Those two in particular, I mean. YMMV)"

RedditForGrownups,f62zagp,t1_f614ib8,1572669231.0,"Just to expand a little on your statement about learning that you can’t control everything. 

Accept that some times, you can’t even control your own reactions and emotions. Accept that you have patterns of behavior that are enormously difficult to change. If you’ve procrastinated on school and work assignments for (almost) 40 years, you are probably going to remain a procrastinator.  

Accept that you may always feel slightly tired from here on out. Accept that things aren’t as easy as you think they ought to be. Meghan Markle is a beautiful, successful former actress who really, really got to marry her prince and have a beautiful baby, but even she isn’t “okay” right now. 
 
Accept that, unless you ARE  Meghan Markle, nothing can make that resting bitch face go away.  Accept your spouse and kids for who they are. If you’re female, accept that if you haven’t had kids yet, you probably won’t.  Accept that life has ups and downs, and you’ve already had some of both and there will probably be more. 

Accept how complicated adult life is, and don’t be afraid to let some things go, things like anger, self-pity and resentment that are holding you — and only you — back from doing great things. 

Accept and understand that almost all of your peers are going through the same problems you are. All it needs is for someone to say it out loud first, and suddenly everyone will be talking about how hard second grade math homework is, or comparing possible symptoms of peri-menopause. 

Finally, accept that you are who you are. 

You’re good at what you’re good at. You’re bad at what you’re bad at. You can’t sing and you’ll never master ice skating, but you can bake the most amazing Tres Leches cake, and you’re good with kids and animals. You are 100% enough, you’re doing the best you can, and you (and Meghan) will both be okay, one way or the other."
