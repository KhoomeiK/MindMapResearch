This is your accomplishment, and it sounds like she created alot of hurdles (am I spelling that right? Foreign, sorry) for you starting early in your life.

I would not invite her. Especially not if her being there will make you feel anything less than happy.

If she's pissed off about that, I'd write her a letter (so she can't interrupt you and can't try to get you to get angry so she can totally invalidate your words) telling her in a respectful way (like you did in your OP) why you chose to go alone.

She wasn't there when you needed a mother (leaving you outside freezing for example, I mean come on, that's straight up abuse) so she won't be there to play proud mom when you accomplished something on your own.

And what an accomplishment by the way, congrats!! You sound like a great person who has been handling the situation very well, so be proud for being a descent human being.

I'll never be able to clean this up without traces, it's not safe for me to be here, "" followed by more intense shouting. 

By this time both me and my SO were waking up looking at eachother thinking wtf is happening, where are we, what time is it, what is this place? It was 5 in the morning after our first night in our new apartment, after 2 hours of sleep after we literally KO'd on the couch cuz tired, 't was a long day.

After we both jumped up after a good 9 seconds of utter confusion, wondering why we woke up fully clothed in a house we never woke up in before, I shouted at my SO to call the cops, I ran into the hallway, upstairs, following the sounds of a wailing woman in what I could only imaginine to be a brutal crime scene. I was legit scared I was on my way to testify in a bad episode of The Killer Next Door. But she was in pain, panic, I had to help her, now, as fast as I could, I wasn't about to bail on a fellow female, damned! 

I knocked on their door and asked if everything was okay in there. She instantly stops screaming and she comes to the door, saying ""Please be a lamb and leave us alone. And please don't touch my door. Ever. Again"" in a very polite and calm voice without opening her door, this was legit the scariest thing I've ever heard, and I've been in customer care for over 15 years so I've had my fair share of creeps, nutters, and weirdos. Yeah, I'm looking at you, Moanie McPerv! 

She then continued to scream like a banshee, she was so loud I can't even describe it. It was like a really bad cover of a Slayer cover of a Slayer cover. Remember when Jimmy and your brother Earl started that band in the garage, and mom crashed their first jamsesh cause she thought they were being slaughtered? It was worse than that. I was about to start bleeding out of my ears. 

Covering my ears, tripping over a bunch of shoes, banging my toe on their table next to the door, I was ready to wake up from this nightmare, when my SO made it upstairs with a baseball bat while dialing the cops while witnessing me doing what I do best, almost killing myself in freak accidents, when all of a sudden an old woman with a black nightgown and an Einstein haircut holding the world's smallest dog, appeared behind us. 

I was ready to fucking die in a very low budget midage slasher movie, with very bad soundtracks but realistic special effects. Spoiler: it never made it to the movie theater. 

She tried to calm us down telling us to slowly walk away, and to follow her downstairs, to hang up the phone and trying to tell us everything was okay. She then explained that what we just heard, was an argument between lovers, about him not taking his shoes of when going inside, and her flipping out cause she appaeantly had some issues with anxiety, she was extremely terrified of germs, so him entering with his shoes on was a nightmare for her. And me touching the door, even worse. 

It took me a good few hours to stop shaking and literally still wondering if all this was just my imagination, when I calmed down. I've got my own issues so I could understand how that must've been a nightmare for her, hoping that this would never repeat itself. 

They never talked about it, she ignored me for a good year before she started to greet me or say more than two words, but she seemed to be doing okay overall.

Sorry man, but if someone doesn't want to talk about something for 11 years, that means that they can't talk about it with you. Believe me, you don't want to become a trigger to your brother.

Little tip: I've been diagnosed with PTSD and the initial trauma happened almost 30 years ago, and I'm still in therapy. Flashbacks are real and your brother may have seen things so horrible that just a small reminder could trigger a flashbacks, and those are real, like real real, don't underestimate PTSD.

I know you probably want to know because you want to help him. If that's so, you should never bring it up again. If you want to know just because you're curious, don't ever bring it up again, ever.

You are not entitled to his story, would you still like to know, knowing now that you can really mess with his head when asking for it? Is that worth it?

I think your intentions are good, if so, don't make it worse, apologize, research PTSD if you want, and tell him you didn't realise what your questions could do, as I'm sure you don't want to see your brother upset, that was never your intention.

You're brothers and he loves you so much, you love him too, tell him that. Good luck!

Sleep is boss, you gave him room and space to game, you don't expect him to stop, you just want him to be considerate towards your sleep.

You let him do whatever he wants, I assume he does the same. That's all nice and cool until one of you is experiencing negative effects that intervine with your health (sleep).

I'd he can't keep it down, he should either man the f up or move the f out."

AskReddit,ex12cj8,t3_cr062n,1565928512.0,"A girl in my group (youth psychiatric facility) lost her parents in a car accident, it was like she died on the inside 
:( she would spend hours ringing the microwave clock and mumbling ""train coming train coming"" with tears running down her face. She just repeated that throughout the day staring into the distance, crying silent tears.

One day she just wasn't there anymore and they wouldn't tell us why. Never knew what happened to her. I think about it a few times a year wondering how she is."

The fact that I don't even enjoy gaming anymore made me extra sad and frustrated. It's as if you've taken away your own way of venting."
