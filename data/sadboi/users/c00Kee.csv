""Gossip"" means a lot of talking about nothing, but SPECULATION, is the specific word used in the report itself!

DCM is caused by low taurine. Taurine is only found in meat (and eggs). Cats can't produce taurine so they must get it from meat. Dogs can produce their own taurine if certain other amino acids are present, which is why they get by with much less animal protein. If a food is mostly plant protein, taurine is added, but if it has sufficient animal protein, taurine has an asterisk in the nutrient listing as non-essential. 

I was feeding my dog Nature's Recipe small breed formula (she's a Westie). With all of media frenzy, I thought I'd step it up a notch and give her Nature's Recipe Prime Blends because it has even more animal protein (and bone broth!) but is still grain free. I also top her kibble off with Crave wet food that boasts it has 99% of its protein from animal sources.

""Anything related to the exact mechanism that causes DCM is speculation at this point."" 

I read a report I believe - this scare was concocted by dog food companies who are losing money on dog food with grains and two PAID vets with hidden affiliations with those companies. Even if the FDA was involved, that quoted line will be ignored by people afraid they are killing their dog.

Also, I've noticed no one is mentioning how ""grain free"" became associated with ""healthier"" in the first place. What happened was a huge batch of non-human grade grain destined for pet food became severely contaminated with mold (and bacteria too I think I remember). And since many pet food manufacturers get their raw materials from the same source, people were told to avoid dog food with grains for the time being, which is precisely what this says about grain free.

With grain or without, the measure of dog food is the quality and quantity of animal-derived protein, including specific meat meal such as chicken meal instead of some mysterious ""by-product meal"". That way any ingredient split wouldn't be as significant if the dog has no special issues. Peas, potatoes, corn, wheat, soy... it doesn't matter."
