depression,f4rss6j,t3_dlfw2v,1571771312.0,Honestly build a support system. I have a therapist and a psychiatric nurse practitioner who handle my care after attempted suicide and it helps. You have to want to change your life for it actually change. I would just like a date and feel like anything I do won't make that happen but I'm trying to get the help I sooooooooo desperately need. Because um.........last time I checked you can't date a Honda Civic Type R ( or can you?????) Anyway I can relate because I have oh so many family troubles that keep me from gaining any real traction in other parts of my life like college progress and dating... but I'm trying to get help with the therapist i'm seeing and sticking to medicine that I've been prescribed. Being someone who attempted suicide I always struggle with why I'm still here but I'm  still figuring it out and most likely so is everyone else who posted here or is reading this.
IAmA,f38yznw,t3_dfzjj1,1570741681.0,Okay why do I feel like no one wants to date me? I’m around 4 couples and all of them are in long term relationships. And I feel they pity me and that’s why they hang out with me.
Accounting,f2xeihc,t3_dehkys,1570477434.0,Honestly accounting I don't know how I feel about it yet someone said I need the class as part of my major for computer programming and information systems but yeah it's difficult for me to get going..... Anyone have any suggestions for a newbie just trying to get through accounting 101. I might pursue accounting in addition to the IT major but I need to know if accounting is right for me.. Any tips are greatly appreciated!
