two oscars in an 29 US gallons....    please no


That won't work out for long, also your tank is still cycling.... oof

One oscar fish needs the minimum of 75 US gallons, for two oscars most people would go for a 125 gal tank for adults.

Oscars are waste machines, I highly don't recommend anything you have going on right now. I can't imagine an oscar fish in a 29 gal but 2.... that's a bit more than overkill... imagine the ammonia lvls. Let alone that the 29 gallon isn't even cycled."

Some life's are cut short by natural causes or deformities illness. Though what's different is that humans are not fish and are for sure not oceanic creatures!

It's not your fault that you're not doing all the best in school. Illness, people, and losses all connect. Focus on yourself rather than stressing on numbers and D's C's whatevers.

We love you man. I hope you get yourself up from that low. Hope you the best ^^"

Aquariums,exh1ri8,t3_cssuh9,1566286572.0,"Is the fish new or did it happen out of nowhere?

Any sharp edges on decor?

Corydoras and bottom dwellers - loaches - catfish seem to catch some sort of bacteria on the floor. It can build up for months until death takes toll. RBD is sort of common. Though not widely known because die offs after shipment aren't discussed much.

Just know that you did your best. And hopefully you even learned something out of  this..

Gravel shouldn't be too sharp, some sands have a sharpness and even some dirt for planted tanks. If a fish gotten skittish and gotten a graze it could get some icky bacteria that they're already susceptible to.

For early signs I'd dose with Tetracycline.

Might try to find a small quarantine tank for cheap, some sort of cycled media. Though from that picture it might be too late.. internal infections are much deadly.

Relax and think about what might be the next step."
selfharm,exh0ngd,t3_cstpes,1566284813.0,"Scars to me means a fight I have went thru. A regret, a time I was unable to stop myself. We all have those times, non SH, that you iust lose yourself in the moment of the pain or just emotions.

Even if you're treated differently because of the scars.. just remember that those people who do say these things either don't mean what they say or are those who you don't want to associate with.

I don't like my scars especially when they're visible to others. It surely can make a person feel a strange guilt.

It's a form of acceptance that can take years.. it's not fun but hopefully one day most of it can be a brush off, it's just part of my body type thing.


-- when one says that you're ""One of the worst"" ""Were you attacked?"" Blah blah blah

There is always someone out there with more severe scarring and dare say that person is gorgeous. Repeat! Scars don't make you ugly. I bet that you are a kind lovely person. It bothers me that others are making your self esteem real down.

Anyways! :)

best wishes"

aquarium,eweomx5,t3_cns0hw,1565331265.0,"It can likely be a sign of internal parasites. Especially since they were originally from a carnival, that don't have a good track record of having healthy fish.

Prazipro - API - General cure - Thomas Labs fish dewormers work well. You'd have to soak his food in with most medications for the parasites. Pelleted foods are preferred) Though I'd recommend for you to do your own research to make sure that you aren't overdosing anything."

selfharm,ew6djo1,t3_cmzyr5,1565164161.0,"It's painful for me to hear as well.  :(

I dabbled in it several times in the past. It's much harder to hide if you slice all over your face! No doubting that. Though several few cuts may not bring much attention. - some people do it so they them self can see it - cry for help/ sign of deeper seeded issues in family life. Sometimes it's just that they want to harm their face? I guess that it's a process of when people's self harm morphs. Like anything in  life it can progress, which is not good at all! It also can happen in a delusional mindset or where you're not in control, a cut everywhere sorta thing.

It's really a show of turmoil, a truly sad and painful thing for anyone."

Advice,ew0j87f,t3_clzgkk,1564991580.0,"I read your original post and I got to say I'm very upset of how this all went down.. even happened in the first place! Damn

Some people get dogs and resell them, kinda reminds me of reselling furniture but with living breathing animals. I find it disgusting that your mother approved her to get your girl. Though you should know to keep your place in the matter, she's your dog too. Lessen to not give in to others so easily. It can make you feel so much guilt afterwards, want and frustration.

The lady must've sold her off privately, so it's unlikely to find a trace of her in shelters. Check Your county's shelter, even call asking if they have an Akita in. Though it's much tougher since she's probably with someone different, a different area, than wherever the woman is.

You have enough evidence that shows that she once was your dog. By the vet, shots, descriptions, and pictures. Only issue is that you're a minor, which if she somehow comes in reach you need a family member to help you.

I'd post wanted adds online - craigslist, facebook, for a wanted Akita dog tagged with several pictures and descriptions. I'd also inform near shelters, they show lost/wanted dogs with pics in a folder or slides.

Was she micro-chipped before you gotten her or while you had her? Moving house or changing the phone number might make it hard to trace her to your folks. Chips hold a registration # plus a phone one. 

Hopefully she's somewhere safe.. but you don't know in these situations. Be strong have hope and be persistent. Don't give up in finding her."

Aquariums,evs1bw1,t3_ckz4jo,1564725762.0,"Algae remover is known to cause problems.. even death. As lots of others said I'd do a water change and monitor parameters.

Algae is a healthy piece of an aquarium, though if with extra lighting - overfeeding - unregualr cleaning schedules it can over run the tank and look unappealing.

If you don't like the look I'd just go get a Algae scraper  (that you can get from most pet stores that have fish). See how much light the tank gets ' near a window or in front of light / how many hours you keep the light on. Just taking more care about it rather than having chemicals to remove it."
