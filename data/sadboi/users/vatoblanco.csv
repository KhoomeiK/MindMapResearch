NewYorkIslanders,fbsbzk9,t1_fbsbimk,1577053126.0,I'd also love to see a game reminder option (though I figure this will be a given) as I get wrapped up in other tasks sometimes and miss chunks of a game without being aware.
NewYorkIslanders,fbsbimk,t3_ee7zhf,1577052930.0,As an Isles diehard in NC this is extremely appealing.  Hope to check it out and I second a delay.  Mostly I listen to the radio coverage since no one here appreciates hockey.
somethingimade,fa1jdhu,t3_e7hats,1575770617.0,This is so far beyond bad ass... I think I've come back to look at it over 5 times now. I feel like I need to learn to cross stitch again (my mom did it when I was little and I would do simple ones) just to have this amazingness in my life but I have nowhere to put them. :(

For those that have participated in the past,  is it possible to gift and not receive?"

But it's my own space and I like it,  just need to set it up better than I currently have it. Keep your head up. The way society has been shaped is complete bullshit. It's not living, it's existing.

I'm honestly amazed I've not been fired but I'm finally getting back to a real job in the next two weeks. I'm beyond thrilled, ride it out and try to use the opportunity to make contact with people where you would like to move in to that field. May be easier with a job other than a busser. Good luck and keep your head up."

If there's anything you have that you don't need, start selling now to get money together for insurance, registration, etc. You don't pay those you're SOL and you'll be on the street or in a shelter. If you find you can live out of your car, move to a state with a higher minimum wage and take any old shit job to pay bills and have money to eat and for fuel. Make sure you have blankets, it will get cold. I use a sleeping bag during the winter. Keep your windows cracked to avoid condensation.  Good luck."

Leathercraft,ezf2dtr,t3_d0qxkg,1567872113.0,This is awesome! I've got a few pairs of raw denim I bought from a start up that don't fit at all and have thought about several projects to use them with leather but I've really struggled with cutting up couple hundred dollar pairs of jeans. Beautiful work! Mind if I inquire as to how you finished the edges?
