GaybrosGoneWild,flmrp0b,t3_fpsipl,1585293851.0,Kinda shy. Here’s a picture of me at my most vulnerable
askgaybros,f9v7vc6,t3_e745av,1575664668.0,Jesus.... you need help
askgaybros,f9hixy0,t1_f9gs6n5,1575315930.0,I would say the rule applies for sex too.  If the guys not showing pictures the sex will probably be bad.

Don’t get me wrong, it’s annoying and worthless. But when are rules for dating are “I want a man with pics who isn’t stingy with nudes,” is it any wonder our dating lives are in such turmoil."
TotallyStraight,f8m4aq5,t3_e0s8f1,1574628076.0,"I would say this is your definition of queer. “Being a man” doesn’t mean you can’t appreciate fashion and being “queer” doesn’t mean you have to hang out with the ladies or can’t captain a sports team. I’m glad you’ve come to your sexuality in such a positive way, but for others it’s much more than just being both masculine and feminine."
depression,f7wiegi,t3_dpl4bu,1574033577.0,"This was me. Until one day the depression blocked me from going into work. It was like a force field around my office and I just couldn’t go in. It was the same way I feel when I turn on the shower and stare at the running warm water and for some reason I just can’t lift my legs to walk in. God, I wish I were sad or loathed myself, but it was just a moment of realizing I couldn’t keep living this double life. I turned around walked to my car, sent my resignation email, and have been driving Uber ever since."

youngjustice,exj59yg,t3_ct2848,1566342290.0,"My guess is they’re leading up to another death. They’ve been referencing the holograms and deaths of characters a little too much. It’ll probably be someone we really like, like M’gann"
askgaybros,exh3r42,t3_cstqi0,1566289672.0,"Oh god, this went way too far. I meant to ask how I refer to my attraction on apps like Grindr and tinder. Not how I label myself. The purpose for this is to not offend trans women when I write pansexual in a profile and maybe some advice from others how to avoid fetishizing the community. Thank you all for the kind words"
askgaybros,exh04pp,t3_cstv3n,1566283927.0,Oh no. Unless you have a very healthy diet
askgaybros,exgzjbj,t1_exgzhs0,1566282987.0,But I’m not bi im only attracted to one gender.
askgaybros,exgze9t,t1_exgzaiq,1566282774.0,"Duh... Reading that I’m like, that sounds so clear and kind. Being so used to apps I’m like, “what’s the secret code I need to use.”"
AskReddit,exgyskq,t3_cstmg8,1566281869.0,I feel sound! Its wild to experience. Also the reason I don’t go to music shows or like crowded environments.
salesforce,exe1lxw,t3_cd8cel,1566194377.0,"You really don’t want a SF cert unless you’re working with a company that pays for it. Doing trailhead is a good idea, but few recruiters will offer an interview with a cert and no “office” experience. Network+ will however, open doors and get you into some higher paying entry level positions. 

I’m an Uber driver and going to a boot camp for coding.  The idea is having something that gets recruiters not managers to give you a call back."
