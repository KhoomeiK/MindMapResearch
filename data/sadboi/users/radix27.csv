Mavericks,fdm4ucp,t1_fdm3o50,1578539828.0,downvote me more but I can surely put up a better defensive lineup than that.
Mavericks,fdm3o50,t1_fdm3lr8,1578539037.0,passive coaching.
Anxiety,fda9h9b,t3_ekfav4,1578243271.0,"I had such feeling before. Felt like skipped heart beats but those are actually heart palpitations. You feel it when your heart beats too hard or too fast, maybe because of too much coffee.

I hope you feel better soon brother. Wishing you the best!"

Anxiety,fd26wut,t3_ejtqgk,1578142636.0,"i felt the same. it‚Äôs like i am not the same person anymore. however when i feel anxious or having a panic attack, i felt better when i stayed away from consuming digital media (social media, video games, netflix, etc). i forced myself to become curious more on people, and have short conversations with them. i asked them how they currently feel, have they eaten already and if they enjoyed it, etc. 

our generation‚Äôs lifestyle sucks to be honest and i feel like it makes us more anxious.

also, during a very anxious time, i think of something that i wouldnt want to do at that moment and then i would do it. that gives me a feeling that i am still in control however counterintuitive it may seem.

i hope you feel better soon brother."
Mavericks,fcjc8vi,t3_ehh41y,1577682779.0,"Lakers team defense were terrific tonight and ours sucked because they knew how to play against our zone. Also, we shot terrible from range which might be due to fatigue setting in the 2nd game of a back to back. If we hit those threes early from the game like we used to, we will be leading a lot by halftime imo."

Mavericks,fc91afz,t3_egqldr,1577545411.0,I think it also adds that Carlisle‚Äôs standards on face-ups and high-posts went so high after coaching Dirk. KP is far from Dirk. Dirk didn‚Äôt post one legged fade away nor did those out of balance acrobatic layups during his first 5 years in the NBA.

PanicAttack,f4r3f4k,t1_f4r30ea,1571762058.0,Thank you so much. Your comment explaining the biological reason behind panic attacks helped me a lot as well.
PanicAttack,f4r1p1h,t1_f4ow3la,1571761340.0,"oh my god, somehow i finally noticed I havent been breathing through my abdomen for a long time already. just had an attack a while ago and tried square breathing via abdomen and the tiger went right away. the reason i might have been breathing through my chest all this time is because i am close to being obese my tummy just wont make me naturally expand my abdomen. badly needed to get some regular exercise now."

Mavericks,esi6yet,t1_esi3z96,1562007978.0,Idk but Powell can play PF/C right? He can backup KP then Maxi can also play as backup to our new starting C. I remember they have good chemistry leading our bench mob front court last season.
