This idea she has of true love and longing does not necessarily translate to the real world and after the honeymoon phase it takes real work soulmate or not and she may have overreacted to the whole not missing each other thing. (I would see that as just feeling secure in the relationship and knowing things will be okay and we can each be happy apart and together).

But since shes made that choice it is likely done and you should move on with good memories behind you. Maybe you guys will reconnect when you are older as friends or more. But for now it may be best to give each other closure/be honest about your feelings, wish each other well and moce on and do you"

No matter how detailed and focused our models of people are in our heads that concept will not always be accurate because people are people and will surprise us.

But, like the other poster said people will do what they want. If they are a good friend I think it may be worth talking with then about it in a non confrontational way to ask them if they like that you initiate conversations, if they enjoy talking to you, if you are being too intense or texting ""too much"" for them (this can be a problem with infjs and non infjs we just love loving on people but it can be a bit much haha)and it is okay to tell then how you feel and that you would like it if they initiated converaations with you more because you like hearing from them. Could just be a misunderatanding or could be anything really but you will never know unless you talk to them and you either need to do this or just accept it. Overthinking on it is just going to make yiou resent them and is going to be bad for the friendship.

What it comes down to thoygh is he will do what he wants and so will yoy. If yiu are thinking of him and want to talk then just do it! If you guys have good conversations when you do talk then i wouldnt worry about it :-). It is fine to talk to them and let them know you want to talk more and be closer but if they dont then best to just let it be the friendship it is :-). Not every friendship can be a deep emotional connection even though thats what infjs crave. I would also try making other friends and try to open up to new people and give people that try to talk to you a chance in your life.

Please dont hate yourself that is a loop you do not want to be in! Be kind to yourself and talk to yourself the way you would a friend-- that has really helped me in that regard. It is okay to be selfish and work on yourself and you should spend time learning to love your alone time!"

You should have kept the peace but been honest about feeling jealous. Later when you wanted space which is fine you should have been honest about why and then when she confrontef you about it you should not have made up some lame excuse about why you wanted a break bc of a server and changed your mind. You should have been honest that you wanted a break bc how you were feeling hurt and ignored and jealous. And so on

Sorry bud, im not meaning to attack you just pointing out this pattern that is almost assuredly .going to push her away for good and that if you want her back you need to cut it the hell out.

Talk to your best friend! Be honest about what is going on, how you feel, and that you want to work with then on your friendship and why that is important to you.

Trust me now is not the time for pride, you need to apologize and be honest with your best friend if you ever want your best friend back. Fortunately it siunds like there is still a chance to save rhis thing so think hard about how and what you want to say and then have a calm discussuon with them. Something like this might be better to do in voice or video chat so that there is no misunderstandings as far as tone and such which can be hard to infer over just text.

I wouldn't necessarily burn bridges with these people, but put your focus on making new friends that you can be closer with and that will not just be good to you at times but good for you all the time. Honestly, might be better to make yourself less available to them and not be the person that is always there for others, being so selfless rarely works out. There is an exception to that and that's your ride or die true friends it is fine to do that for because they do the same for you. But otherwise boundaries are okay and may even get them to respect you more and want to be better friends (people are weird like that lol). I know it's easier said than done but give it a shot! :-).

PS I don't hate you so not everyone does! And even these friends or ""friends"" of yours probably don't hate you, they just may not be your people. And that's okay! Keep being you and it is SO okay to put yourself first, you deserve that! If you need some space from them then you take it!"

Advice,fpio5ig,t3_gdp7m5,1588645015.0,"Why are you controlling who your friend is friends with? All that is going to do is push you away and closer to other friends including the one you dont like. 

Be supportive and encourage your friend to find out more information and video chat and if they do meet to do so in public and not alone."

Advice,fpfbsvr,t3_gd4ssy,1588566760.0,"Wish her a happy birthday then continue giving her space. While you focus on you and new friends. Dont burn bridges. Hell at least she actually told you she needed/wanted space and didnt lie while silently resenting you then block/ghosted you out of nowhere like some people do! Lol

Basically saying happy birthday costs you almost nothing and keeps your options open and whether she wants to be friends up to her so not your problem/worry."
Advice,fpf82zj,t3_gd46tf,1588564062.0,Geeze wherevee you moved sounds terrible people wise lol. Im not really sure outside of meeting people at a sports event or concert or through work but if you figure it out let me know because I'd like to make nee friends as well lol.
Advice,fpealmy,t3_gcz55o,1588543686.0,"Yes the cashiers check could be fake. Do the transacrion in person at the bank..Have the buyer take out cash, they give you the cash you sign over the car, then you ger your own cashiers check and mobile deposit to your bank or just deposit the cash into your account if you bank at the same bank.

...then i realized bc of the pandemic you probably cant go into the bank whoops. I guess you could still do it from the drive through windows but idk. 

Well best case if you get a cashiera check cash ir at rhe bank its from. And donr sign over the car until you have your money."
Advice,fpdx9np,t1_fpdwfhq,1588536075.0,This. If you are a good person that's all that matters. If someone does have a problen with you bc of your weight or some other BS then FUCK THEM lol. You don't want to be friends with shitty people like that anyway lol.
Advice,fpdw591,t3_gcppo4,1588535434.0,"Dang well you arent alome, my best friend (also my 2nd cousin lol) up and blocked me without a word after two weeks of not talking to me after i got frustrated at them for lying to me for a month and then yet again bailing on plans lol.

I spent a long time feeling like total shit and was kind of a wreck to be honest lmao because i totally blamed myself and beat myself up over everythibg in hindsight that i maybe might have done wring lols. I really didnt want to see anything bad in my best friend i guess so i just blamed me even though i never stopped tryi g to be a good friend to them and kept my promises best i cohld while she did neither lol! Typical me haha

After a lot of time and self reflection im feeling better about myself and you will too. Funnily enough I ki d of surprised myself because while i woyld have expecred myself to be like welp #notrust never trusting anyone again after that but i actually was like ya know what, i need to trust /more/ people and give other friends a chance to be my friend especially the ones that want to be there haha so i put that freed up time and energy i to other friendships and that did help. While it didnt go as well as i would have liked i did also ask my other friends for reassurance on if i was a good person and good friend and some friends came through, others ignored me, and one stopped talking to me lmfao (who does that!?) But at least that showed me who my true friends are so theres that lol.

Just give it time and focus on you and new friends or building old friendships. In time try to forgive your best friend if only for yourself so that you can move on. If they come back around maybe let them back in. Ut only if it would be good for you.

Jessica asked me if i would do that if Julian ever came back into my life and apologized and I told her I wouldnt be mean to her-- im not even mad at her really just hurt and sad-- that i would forgive her and i would probably even still be friends though it would be a long road back to being the bffs we were before if ever trust wise."

On the other hand, you mom does not have to help you pay for school and can kick you out after giving proper notice (likely at least 30 days after which if you'd don't leave you'd have to be evicted and there is a moratorium on evictions at the moment so it may take her a couple months to legally evict you giving you time to find a place hopefully heh)."
Advice,fpc5fqs,t3_gclvyf,1588488213.0,Lol i hear ya and can relate to the friend stuff! well we can be friends 😂 ps honest and blunt/speak your mind is the best (everyone needs that friend!) dont change that for anyone haha. Only problem is it is sonetimes too good of a filter in your life keeping the crap friends out that you do have to rely on yourself a lot and dont have that friend time of your lifestyle you see everyone else seems to enjoy on social media lol.

Advice,fpbr9hc,t3_gcjk64,1588476739.0,"You can tell your friends about the breakup and let them know that you would feel uncomfprtable with them talking /being friends with him still but thats all you can and should do. 

Trust your friends to be your friend regardless of who else they are friends with. At least if you are upfront and honest with them they can make their own choices knowing your perspective and maybe they take a step back from their friendships wirh him maybe not but knowing it makes you uncomfortable at least they will know not to invite both of you to the next group outing or whatever and can at least try to make things less awkward for both of their friends.."

Advice,fp8fa13,t3_gbzm5j,1588390825.0,"Remember their birthday, check on them/be there for them, and tell them you love them! Life is short, if you love your friends let them know."
Advice,fp76boa,t3_gbpdve,1588364849.0,Dont pay or even reply to the email. It is a scam. Your sister should change her passwords but they likely didnt even access whatever account it was-- they just obtained email and pw jnfo from a list obtained by a databreach amd are mass mailing out hoping to catch low hanging fruit scared into paying tbem money.
Advice,fp6akz1,t1_fp68u8e,1588349026.0,"Hmm that's a tough situation..you do need to make sure that you are okay first. That's not wrong of you.

I would just try not to burn any bridges but at the same time if you do say goodbye whether that works out good or bad since you are walking away anyway but do care about them you might try talking to their parents so that they hopefully can know what is going on and can find them help. Your friend may see this as a betrayal of trust but in this situation i think it could be justified.. Maybe they hate you but so long as they are alive and get help they have a chance to eventually find their happiness in life with or without you in it..."
Advice,fp66zdz,t1_fp64ust,1588347205.0,"You should have a honest talk with your friend about how you feel and that you care about them and want to support them but you need to mentally/emotionally recharge. It might be helpful to help your friend find a therapist or counselor that they can talk to and work on treatment and coping strategies with.

Depression really sucks and you should at least talk to your friend before walking away. Give them a chance to be a good friend, they may nit be aware how much this is weighing on and affecting you."
depression,fp4w26i,t1_fp4vofn,1588308897.0,"You're welcome. I know what it's like to just need a friend! 

Cry if you have to, just let it all out and know that it is okay to not be okay! As for your quesrions, honestly Im not sure if God is real or not but I would like to believe so. You are very much real and deserve happiness. Life is complicated and rarely easy but it is worth it and I think everyone has a purpose and a light and perspective that only they can bring to this world. Who knows what great things you can accomplish for yourself and the impact you have had and will have on others :-)."
depression,fp4vn00,t3_gba5al,1588308574.0,"Hugs. I am so sorry you went through that! He is not good for you and does not deserve the love you have to give the right person. As for the assault he is so wrong, it is NOT your fault.

If you ever need a friend I'm here. Stay safe, stay strong, and protect your heart!"
depression,fp4uyt1,t3_gbawqs,1588308066.0,"I hear you. It might help to step back from the friendship a bit until you get over your romantic feelings. But with all this quarrantine stuff going on it might not be the best timing aa you would want to also be making new friends and staying busy to keep your mind and heart occupied heh.

Im sorry about your parents, that's tough :-/. I hope that you have a support system from other more understanding people in your life!"
depression,fp4ucx2,t3_gbbd0k,1588307615.0,"Aww Im sorry you're friend is going through a hard time and you are worrying about them :-(. It sounds like you are being a great friend and I think the best thing you can do is to keep checking in with him and doing what you have been doing which is likely incredibly helpful to your friend to know that you are present and there for rhem. You should gently encourage them to reach out to their therapist as well and/or help them find one rhey are more comfortable/compatible with.

Thanks for being a good friend, the world needs more friends like you!! Please dont forget to take time for yourself away from your friend if you need to recharge and it is okay to do that, just communicate with your friend about it."
Advice,fp4sxrp,t3_gbbbcr,1588306576.0,No. Is a complete sentence. If he doesnt knock it off and never bring it up again good otherwise find another job and consult a lawyer about hostole work environment though depending how small the company is you may have less recourse in that respect.
Advice,fp47tkh,t3_gb60so,1588293421.0,"Hmm well I would give her reassurance but by very specific (like you mentioned about her freckles being cute). Don't just tell her she's pretty, that's not really going to help. Tell her she's pretty because of X. Listen to her concerns about her self-image and help her make changes to get the body she feels comfortable in (so long as they are healthy things, don't encourage unhealthy diets or worse stuff like that), and support/encourage her to talk to a professional if that's something she is considering doing."
Advice,fp46i1n,t1_fp3qpq4,1588292661.0,"heh i feel ya, I feel like apologizing all the time but there's no need here, it's what friends are for and your real friends will understand! I read an article awhile back that was basically stop saying sorry and say thanks instead though don't thank them all the time either as that may also annoy them :D Just have to find the right balance dude."
Advice,fp3syis,t3_gb38uj,1588285230.0,Also if it would help go to one or more friends that are trustworthy and just be honest about you going through a rough time and ask if they can check in with you every week or something and you do the same for them even if its just a quick chat or something on their end bc they are doing fine and thats okay too haha.
