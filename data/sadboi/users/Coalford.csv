AskReddit,fp9lmah,t3_gbxneq,1588429250.0,"The second I read this I thought of Chris.


I spent a week and a bit at a hostel in Paris in 2007 and the room mate I had was a 50ish year old french man named Chris. He was an... interesting dude. 


At the time I was a very very timid 19 year old. I had never been away from home before, and I was traveling Europe alone. I'd only left the hostel room to go buy food. I wasn't good at making new friends, and in the week I had been there, I'd yet to have a conversation with another person. 


Like I said. Timid kid.


Then Chris showed up in my room and changed my life.


He looked like a French Henry Rollins who might have spent a few years on the streets. The entirety of his arms and legs were covered in what looked to be self inflicted cuts. During my 48 hours hanging with him, he probably drank 6 or 7 full bottles of Pastis and had a cigarette in his lips from the moment he woke from the moment he went to bed. 


The first time I walked in the room he got off his bed, grabbed my hand and shook it. Then he said in his thick accent, ""I'm Chris, I'm the King of Paris.""


He took me me all across the entirety of Paris. Secret little bars, and weird alleys with art. Roofs you could smoke on and look at the city. Strange, wild, and bizzare people in weirder and stranger places. All while pouring Pastis and water out of his bag into his clear plastic cup. 


A security guard tried to detain me in a store because he thought I was shoplifting. Chris turned around, saw I wasn't walking with him anymore, then charged back, shoved the guard over, grabbed my arm and we ran. It was the first time I'd ever been involved in anything even remotely 'dangerous'. I tried to explain that I could have just proven I hadn't stole, I still had the receipt, and he said ""It's easier just to be free.""


When we left he gave me his email and said to let him know how the rest of my trip was. The email was some kind of french anal joke that I can't quite remember. It suited his personality. He gave me a big hug, and I hopped on the train to Amsterdam.


I emailed him twice and never heard back.


I constantly think about those scars all over him, the inhuman amount of drinking, and realize he was probably a very very troubled guy. But he legit taught me so many things. How to find adventure everywhere I went, how to be fearless, and how to most of all, not give a fuck what people think.


Thanks Chris, wherever you are."

bulimia,fcpxau8,t1_fcpuloz,1577874150.0,"1) This is going to sound dumb, but I imagined my grandfather being bulimic.

I'd constantly think of me as an old man, still suffering for this, ten, twenty, thirty years in the future, unable to enjoy cake or ice cream or cereal, etc.

I thought about him, just stoked for us visiting, or going golfing, or having a pint... The last thing on his mind was his physical appearance. I imagined him having to take time from his day, or a good meal, or a party to go to the bathroom to puke to make himself feel good.

And then I thought about how at 65, no one cares what you look like. You're doing the things you love. Our body is just a vessel.
A vessel we should take care of, for sure, but it's our spirit that matters.

2) it's important to note in those 15 years I got better several times over varying degrees. So many hiccups. So many 1 day or 4 week or 9 month periods clean. Even a 12 hour time clean can be a success for you. I'm sure I'll have more hiccups again and so will we all. .

Part of having an eating disorder is the inability to see the real you.

At 120 pounds as a male I was constantly certain I was  too fat. 
Im 190 now and healthy and I look back now and see how uncomfortably skinny I was.

Purging more will make you seem more fat as it will swelll your face and make your retain water. I guarantee if you stop purging you will stop retaining water.

Your mind will tell you you're growing steadily but I assure you you're beautiful and healthy.

Not once. 

Yet we're still here, dealing with it ourselves.

I have friends who have coached, tutored, cleaned etc, all for free at a variety of schools that still didn't hire them when the job opened up.

The reason why?

*Why would the principal/employer pay for something they're already getting for free?*

I did this with my old job too. I made the mistake of letting the boss know I had experience with computers and POS service. It started off as a few random updates here and there, until I had entire shifts scheduled at servers wage to update the system for 8 hours. 

One day, during a shift I told him that basically I was the only employee that knew the system, and I wanted $35 an hour for whenever I was doing POS work. He paid it.
He would have kept me doing it for $8 an hour happily for the rest of time had I not pulled the plug.
