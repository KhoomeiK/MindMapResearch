Nao sei como é sua concentração nas aulas, mas se vc ""viaja"" muito e nao consegue prestar atenção no que é importante pode ser que vc tenha TDAH. Se for isso vc tem duas opções: procurar um psiquiatra pra te analisar e se for TDAH te receitar Ritalina e arruinar seu futuro como um ser criativo único e te padronizar como uma pessoa ""normal"" para fazer coisas ""normais"", ou vc pode entrar numa faculdade de design ou aprender desenho por conta própria e começar a projetar coisas incríveis que ninguem havia pensado antes e ganhar muito dinheiro.
Começa a analisar a necessidade das pessoas no dia a dia para criar objetos que as auxiliem. 
Vc tem grande futuro, só precisa aprender a canalizar sua habilidade, pra isso recomendo procurar um psicólogo pra te auxiliar."
