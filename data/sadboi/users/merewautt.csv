indie,fr5x53h,t3_gmis0q,1589916137.0,"\-Note, I'm doing strictly official Strokes songs for my sanity (or things like Instant Crush and I'll Try Anything Once would definitely be strong contenders). The order is also very loose. All of these could probably be from anywhere from 1-5 for me. These are top 5 by my own musical sensibilities, not popularity or more other ""objective"" measures. 

\- What ever Happened? - Amazing song, everything about it works. Seems to be well liked among casual Strokes fans but I rarely see it mentioned as glowingly by die-hards. Truly cinematic. 

\- New York City Cops - Just... a banger. Before TNA I would said unrivaled peak of Julian's delivery. Honestly enough said. Great song and the back story of why it wasn't released when it was supposed to be (the album was slated for release not long after 9/11 lol) cracks me up because it's my personal level of having bad timing/putting my foot in my mouth.

\- Welcome to Japan - It's a standout and has been since the beginning. The Stroke's have a silly side in their discography and this is the peak of it. 

\- Someday - Beautiful song, some of Strokes' best lyricism. Everybody knows this song even if they don't know this song. Get's more melancholy or less melancholy depending on your own head space. (Note: I almost put Life is Simple in the Moonlight here, they've always reminded me of each other, they both have themes of life circumstances, lying to oneself, pride, etc. but LiSitM is more conventionally down beat) 

\- Ode to the Mets - While not even my personal favorite off TNA by listens, it's 100% the masterpiece of the album. It's overall a sonically heavy song (lyrically heavy too), but it has moments of fun in it (Drums please, Fab) that keep it from dragging and it give it an interesting personality. The placement as the album closer is also a TOP NOTCH album layout decision, which Strokes have struggled with in the past (imo). If the strokes never release another album together officially, this would be a perfect track to end on.

The... issues? They aren't issues. They're facets of the data themselves.

And I'm not scared at all. I've never argued that they don't, just that it's not some huge act against nature and ""how things should be naturally"". The whole discussion began on a comment that the rankings of male attractiveness HAVE to fall on a Normal Distribution and the fact that it doesn't when women rank men shows that women are somehow .. wrong?

It isn't. You're talking out your ass again like you were when you made your initial claim about how normal distributions *have* to show up. To even claim this is hilarious because any scientific paper on attractiveness would do it based on large pools of rating answers from average people, and would show the exact ""skewed"" results you're complaining about. No scientists are deciding randomly themselves what conventionally attractive features (a cultural phenomena) are and then plotting them to see if they show up in what distribution.

PurplePillDebate,fqvld8d,t1_fqvkno4,1589679733.0,">Its the attractive traits that plot a normal distribution (according to CLT) , not women's perception of them.

This is hilariously circular logic. How is a feature attractive if it's not perceived to be? ""Attractive"" features do not exist objectively outside of the human mind. Features that increase chances of survival in a situation? Sure. But without that situation, and no new cultural appreciation for it, it just becomes ""a feature"".

A feature that does not increase the ability to gain partners (let alone decreases the ability) by definition cannot be called an ""attractive"" feature. It can be something else, but not attractive in the sexual sense. It doesn't matter what rate it occurs at in a certain population, the perception and impact on gaining partners are what make it fall under the umbrella of attractive.

If you're plotting certain features and they're not tracking to an increase in ability to gain partners, then you're mistaken about which features are considered attractive."
PurplePillDebate,fqvk8md,t1_fqviu70,1589679062.0,"Sure, for one, humans are some of the most complex animals on earth and one of THE only animals that passes on shifting and nuanced cultural values to their young. ""Attractiveness"", accordingly, as humans, is a partly cultural phenomena when compared to other animals for whom it is entirely instinctual and only changes under high selective pressure. Humans, on the other hand, have minds that create art and perceive aesthetics in ways no other animals do (culturally).

So is the actual distribution of certain pro-survival features more lopsided in humans compared to other animals? No. Is the *perception and attainment of attractiveness* in humans a much more complex variable to measure and achieve than it is in other animals (because we have complex, cultural minds and live in surplus)? Yes.

Do these factors make human sexual attraction in highly cultural societies a *horrible* trait to expect to measure and plot onto a natural distribution (which is mostly based on natural phenomena with a more 1:1 connection to physical laws?) Definitely.

If I were doing a some kind of research and had to bet money ahead of time on which sort of distribution would fit *any* highly cultural human phenomena, the natural distribution *would be one of my last choices.* It takes a huge misunderstanding of human neurology and what ""attractiveness"" even is to *expect* it to plot on a natural distribution--- especially permanently, as human tastes and lifestyles change."

GenderCritical,fquec0q,t1_fqt7jjs,1589657356.0,"What’s interesting is it seems to correlate with something we’ve been studying in “game theory” (essentially the scientific study of strategy and how the human and animal minds works within different contexts that involve strategy development) for a while now. It’s the ability to alter strategy when faced with changing “rules” of a game mid game (with the analogy being changing circumstances faced in life and other strategic contexts).

Some people are very good at this and change strategy at the earliest state they are confronted with a reality that has changed or does not meet their prior expectations. Other people don’t do it as quickly, but eventually catch on (or they can do it in some contexts, but not others. Eg- They're amazing at matching the playing style of their partner in tennis, but struggle to match the social energy of a room). And *some people* find the whole process extremely taxing (intellectually AND, interestingly, emotionally) and shut down at best, rage against the ideas of an uncontrollable circumstance at worse. 

We can even measure this ability in other species. Let’s say we train an animal on the location of a piece of food. Once it has the *EXPECTATION* of where the food is has been set, a maze or obstacle can be added. Some species and individuals immediately change course and find a new logical way to operate to get the cheese. Some struggle and spend more time than reasonable trying to use the previous strategy, but eventually try a new variety of actions. Others shut down and make weak or no further attempts to find the food past the obstacle, maybe even lashing out at it (far past what is expected as its own form of getting around it) and any other researcher or animal in the vicinity.

This quality is very influential on the way a person operates in their world. It has implications for how open to new stimuli you are, how risk averse you operate, and what tools (Ingenuity and variety vs rage and violence and one track persistence in the face of consistent failure) you use on the environment around you.

This is the quality that tends to decide if you can reconcile previous expectations with an adult reality healthily. This tends to be the psychological quality missing in a lot of men who are regressive and aggressive about it.

Right now it seems like this quality is at least somewhat biological, because it varies from species to species. But within in each species there’s also individual variation. 

This individual variation is probably also at least partly biological, but also can probably be trained as any other skills with a biological factor can be (like how some people have higher genetic capacity for playing the piano, but most anyone could learn to at least play Old McDonald if placed in a class). I don’t think men in patriarchal societies are trained in this kind of thinking in social contexts as thoroughly as  women and other minorities are. Thus, on average, they would tend to have a larger chunk of their populations that is just hopelessly unable to reconcile their previous expectations and successfully come up with the ability to act pro-socially as adults (in our current culture where that is starting to be demanded of them.) You have a huge chunk of people where this skill is almost completely atrophied (at least in this socio-cultural context) due to their expereience as a male in a patriarchal society. When nothing is challenged socio-culturally, it's almost unnoticeable, but in times of cultural change and reinvention, this group of people becomes enraged and thus much more dangerous and noticeable. 

Tldr- it’s a specific skill cognitive researchers have been looking into for ages. It’s probably at least partly genetic but atrophies with lack of use. Our culture demands this skill less of men (especially in socio-cultural contexts), so they are often atrophied in this area and act accordingly. This harms women and other intersecting groups. Men who successfully channel critiqued behavior into new behavior seem to have levels of this skill more on par with women and minorities. Somehow (good parents, luck, mental aptitude etc.) their's is strong and un-atrophied and they can accept and cope with women and modern life and in general."
GenderCritical,fqsk56k,t3_gkmduz,1589609558.0,"It all comes down to expectation vs reality for misogynists in my experience. If you ever get an insight into their head, when they're not being glib or too haughty to explain themselves (a big IF, I know) and really try to dig into where the *rage* (just the seething fuckin' rage) comes from----essentially they feel they were sold on a reality that doesn't exist.

They're culturally hyper aware in a sense, especially in childhood and early adulthood in my opinion, and have very clear ideas about what a culture ""says"" (pop culture, stereotypes, archetypes, values, goals, etc.). They just do not question these cultural narratives, mostly aren't even aware they've bought into them. In early adulthood or later, they begin to experience what the culture ""does"" (stereotypes rebelled against, pop culture critiqued and laughed at, values challenged, goals not a given) and it's in stark contrast to what they've been (unconsciously) swallowing wholesale during their most formative years.

This triggers rage for a variety of reasons in certain types of men.

\- One is the obvious. Expectation of a certain set of circumstances (a certain amount of respect, a certain lifestyle--- especially a romantic or economically prosperous one, a certain ""identity"" or role in any community), and then not getting it. It's the same basic entitlement involved in a child's meltdown and it's been covered extensively in feminist literature. Being ""promised"" something and not getting it is much more upsetting psychologically than just wanting something with no expectation. This increases exponentially if they feel disconnected from the masculine role they played and feel they wasted their time ""giving"" their ""hard work"" to society. They feel they were ""used"" and thrown away. Being told they're entitled because *reality* never promised these things in the first place (the honest truth) is the last slap in the face. Logically, if they were betrayed at all it was by the promise of traditional masculinity that a patriarchal culture makes, but they can't fathom that. They're deciding mommy is the mean one because she's ultimately the one who has to say no to all the fantastic and unrealistic things daddy promised. They're shooting the messenger.

\-Another reason this reality vs expectation issue can cause rage is because these men are often socially stunted and rely heavily on the expectations and cultural narratives of their childhoods to navigate the world around them. They don't do well cognitively with nuance, changing expectations, or channeling critiqued behavior into new behavior. When women (or any other group) assert their equal personhood and critique the culture, these men are having their road map criticized and thrown out mid road trip, and they're having a meltdown because at the same time someone just yelled at them for missing an exit. Because they can't succeed in these circumstances, they think they must be *inherently* unfair and rebel against them--- never once questioning if the trip is completely navigable for the average person, but that their cultural upbringing as a male has left them below average for this type of situation.

This all culminates in a distinct impression of lack of control (which is a much more disorienting feeling for a group whose cultural identity is built on having extra amounts of control), and men develop rage and hate for women to cope with it. We're not playing the part right and ""keeping up our part of the deal"" (completely oblivious to the fact that it's because we got the bum half of it, not because we're evil con artists out to waste their energy). Or we're changing the game and making it impossible to win (just for shits I guess? Revenge for the more conspiratorial minded ones?).

Add in some feedback loops (you have inkling of something and things that confirm it tend to catch your eye, thus making it an even more firmly entrenched belief that searches out more bias confirming examples) and some genuine radicalization pipelines (clinging desperately to an outdated cultural narrative wasn't a dumb thing of me to do! Not if it's backed by ""science""!) and you get an easy picture of why some men can't stand the sight of a woman doing certain things and lash out at what (should be) considered that woman's business.

They're warped and they don't posses the mental facilities that many people do to un-warp themselves---so instead of changing course when faced with a reality that differs from expectation (the logical thing to do), they spin even farther out in the wrong direction and try to change reality."

Sinner."" and it threw me for a fucking loop.

He was a priest, but he also worked at my school, so we technically *did* know each other in a way where he could have an opinion on my personality, and it (the interaction) really fucked with me lmao. I still think about it every time the topic of confession comes up.

Also, I don't know if it's different elsewhere in the world, but those tiny boxes where they can't see you did not exist where I was lol.

I tried it but every interview she did I wanted to tear my skin off. It was like watching the office during the cringe-y parts. It hurt. She even outed a perfectly pleasant and pretty far removed person from the case as having a prior arrest for PROSTITUTION, like 20+ years ago, for no reason.

Nootropics,fqb1hfh,t1_fqaocft,1589228926.0,">Placebo is so powerful that it can work even when you know it's placebo.

This facet of the placebo effect is why I'm convinced the results (at least partly) come from a form of inadvertent mindfulness (as in mindfulness meditation).

Most people go through the day on semi-autopilot, and when they do feel something unpleasant, their immediate instinct is to try to minimize it, to feel better, to resist it.

As anyone who has done a mindfulness technique will tell you, this is actually incredibly counter productive. Doing the opposite---focusing on the sensation (mindfulness)--- for some reason, seems to *lessen* pain. Seriously. Next time you have a sore muscle or something, try to *focus* extremely on it. Find exactly where and when you're feeling the pain. Try to make it feel *worse.* Try to describe and experience it as intently as possible, second to second. Suddenly, things get kind of fuzzy mentally and the pain is more nebulous and less distracting because you're not resisting it---if not completely reinterpreted mentally. 

When these studies are being ran, participants are asked to *record and describe* any and all symptoms. This puts them in an aware (mindful) state, where they're interacting with the feeling (or lack of feeling) actively, as opposed to of resisting it, or registering what's not really there or what's at a lower intensity than they would register on autopilot.

That + some feel good hormones from a feeling of control or ""help"" and bada bing bada boom: people feel better, or become *aware* of the actual (better) state of the their body than they register on autopilot.

It's really interesting stuff, and pain management studies on mindfulness techniques show results that I think track nicely with what shows up in a lot of ""placebo"" situations."
ArtistLounge,fqaxzz6,t3_ghifcv,1589227222.0,"You shouldn't! Or not necessarily.

Many people believe this is what keeps an artists' work interesting (engagement with every day life that the audience for the art also engages in).

Bo Burnham is a comedian who blew up from his youtube videos when he was still in high school and went straight into working in comedy full time. In one of his most recent specials (or interviews? I can't remember) he mentions how his work has suffered because his content was inspired by the rhythms of everyday life, but now his everyday life *for years* has been nothing but comedy writing and show biz--- topics which aren't as relatable or easy to write about for a larger audience.

He's essentially become a ""comedian's comedian"" (or felt he was), which isn't a bad thing, but many artists fear it (like musicians and their ""sophomore slump"" ---when they try to write their next album after experiencing great fame with their first, and audiences just don't connect). Even when you're not doing ""art"", everything you do *informs your perspective* which eventually ends up shaping some facet of your art.

morbidquestions,fqaw9uv,t3_ghf5yq,1589226384.0,"Gleaned from watching a bunch of true crime: (True) unconditional love turns you into *a monster*.

All the time in criminal cases you see these parents/friends/lovers just absolutely TRAPPED and *demented* by the love they have for their child/friend/lover (the criminal). They'll defend/participate in MONSTROUS acts, lie, assert innocence in the face of all reason, victimize people further, and on and on. They could be the most normal person in the world and it just, like, *twists* them into something kind of disgusting to look at. All because they truly love that person 100% unconditionally.

It's made me feel like love should always be.. 95% unconditional. My sister is the person I love the most on this earth, but if she got caught murdering and eating children I'd do everything in my power to have her see justice and would have a hard time ever looking at her again under any circumstances.

Your own behavior isn't necessarily the bar for how low your morals can go, it's the behavior of *whoever you love unconditionally,* too. If you love and value someone unconditionally who can do horrible things, by extension, there are certain **horrible** things that you *wouldn't want to see exposed or punished.* It's awful and it's really scary to watch how twisted the ""average"" person can become just by loving a decidedly *below average* person.

Conditional love is the only state in which your own personal morals are stable and consistent, but in a lot of cases I don't even think it's a choice. I know for a FACT, my mother would help me cover up a murder if I asked her to. She's a SAINT overall, but if it came down to it, she'd be a monster for me and I don't even think she could stop herself. Very interesting and scary stuff to think about."
books,fqast7k,t3_ghqm0x,1589224669.0,"Honestly books' reputation as ""only for people with good attention spans"" always confused me. I have a horrible attention span (medical grade bad lol) and books were the BEST medium for that situation. They don't move on without you! If I zone out, the page is right there! I can read the same paragraph 10 tens if I need to! A random thought catching my imagination as I read is, like, a huge intentional part of the experience.

Movies, TV shows, video games, etc., on the other hand, all move on without you if you zone out, and there's consequences (you lose the game, plot points have been spoiled but without the extra context that comes with paying attention, etc.). At the very least, there's extra effort to get back to where you think you left off.

I think the assumption that movies/tv/video games are BETTER or EASIER for people with poor attention spans is kind of a weird cultural misconception. Books are IDEAL if you're the type of person who gets sparked by a thought and just runs away with it (to the detriment of anything sensory going on around you).

Given a book and a movie of equal interest to me, I'll finish the book faster, easier, and with better comprehension than the movie every time, and I see the same in other people with attention span issues (I go to a group for people with adult ADHD diagnoses). Especially under normal circumstances where phones and whatnot are available during each.

I *do* think there's a phenomena where books catch people's attention less than other flashier media *when making the initial choice between the two*, but that it's an issue of ""desensitization"" to stimuli (why imagine it when it can be blasted at my eyeballs in all modern movie magic glory?)--- not necessarily one of ""attention span"" as it relates to executive functioning once a book is started."

Existentialism,fq7trhq,t1_fq69ozo,1589152035.0,"I think when people say ""purpose"" they don't mean ""biological tendency"", they mean ""reason to fulfill that biological tendency"".

Unless you're religious, there really doesn't seem to be any objective reason to fulfill our biological tendency to live a human life and all that usually entails, especially the culturally specific ones that are often the topic of philosophy.

Subjectively, inside our own minds, as result of our biology--- it's unpleasant to kill oneself or give up eating or fucking. People do it though, and as of right now, we know of no cosmological constant that gives any ""outside of biological impulses"" reason for *having* to do these things (or any other ""good"" things) against one's will if these biological impulses are absent or malfunction.

Pretty much all existentialism is a conversation on the recursive nature of justifying human action. The minutia of our lives (our personal actions, our opinions, our understandings, etc.) can only be justified back to biology, which isn't satisfying as biological creatures searching ""reasons to follow impulse/tendency"" outside of ourselves. It's a loop. ""I'm a biological creature, but I am self aware of that fact. Is there any reason to follow my own logic/passion/tendencies/thoughts--- all complex *biological* phenomena--- *outside* of my own or some other biological creature's experience of them? (Basically, is there any effect on the larger universe, ie the non-biological? Is there any facet of the universe that seems sentient and judging? Is there any physical constant that will or won't be fulfilled (thus actually distructing something non biolgical) that fails or falls apart based on my doing or not doing what my biology tells me to?)  Or am I justifying my own biology based tendencies and actions with my own and other creatures' biology based logic or experience ?""

As of right now, our understanding of the answers to all those ""existential"" or cosmological questions is a resounding ""No, not really, not even a little, actually. All the consequences of human actions are experienced only by oneself, another human, or another biological creature (all of life on earth are part of our family tree, the tree of life on earth, which we are looking outside of). There seem to be no non-biolgical entities (laws, ""reasons"", gods, math, etc.) that experience, judge, or fail to work based on human action. Any and all justification for any and all sentient action is biological, and not critical to the structure of the universe.""

This smacks of lack of ""reason"" outside of one's own biological impulses *to follow one's biological impulses* to most who ponder the question. This lack of ultimate and ""removed-from-biology"" reasoning ironically seems to hamper some humans' ability or enjoyment to live (because all living *is* is one's specific fulfillment of their biological impulse)---itself an ironic biologic impulse or tendency.

Others (like myself---just for full disclosure) don't necessarily experience the biological tendency to be discouraged by that fact, but just find it an interesting and mind bending fact about living life as a human being. One that may or may not be enlightened or overturned in death or the end of the universe, or even 100s of years by now through scientific discovery. Existentially philosophy from that point on is just the discussion of different *implications* of possible ""reasons"" that could be found, or the ones from the lack of one existing. However, a lot of discussion and elaboration of these implications among people who think there *is* a non-biological reason to live a certain type of biological life have become their own philosophical or even theological fields."

A lot of people would not have the blood pressure/blood sugar stability for such a set up (especially not for multiple days or weeks in a row)--- to not make their work outs harder (or even eventually dangerous) on a fasting system. 2000 calories is 2000 calories but if someone ate them the night before after a day of training, and then went to bed, woke up 12 hours later, and then started training again (with no intention of eating again until that evening after *this* training day), the most likely scenario is they feel like shit, don't train as hard, and then eventually pass out within the first few days of trying to make it work. Have you taken an extremely hot shower that lowered your blood pressure too low (for whatever reason)? The black spots in your vision and the nausea? It would probably feel like that if it didn't end up working for you. And this is ALL assuming you don't accidentally eat less calories than usual due to the effects of the limited eating window.

Some people struggle to do IF even on regular lifestyles because the blood sugar and blood pressure technicalities just never straighten out for them and they're continuously grouch-y, foggy headed, and light headed. It's even trickier if you have an extremely rigorous physical routine.

I'm sure some athletes have trained themselves into such a system, but they probably had trainers keep an eye on them, and I think diving head first into a schedule like that with no guidance is probably not a great idea.

If you're training every day, do you have some sort of athletics training expert or team doctor you could reach out to and ask for guidance/supervision? That would be my next step if I were extremely attached to the idea of starting IF with your lifestyle."
myfriendwantstoknow,fpx7tkg,t1_fpv3xze,1588977334.0,"It could be a few things:

\-Stimulation: If your friend has a high tolerance for sensation (pain tolerance is an easy tell. If you have a high pain tolerance you might also have higher threshold for experiencing all other sensations). This isn't necessarily ideal because psychologically the body needs stimulation in the form of sensations, it's an evolutionary adaption that still impacts our health. If your friend has a high tolerance, their body might be craving stimulation and it takes a strong burst of sensation to get it. It feels pleasurable in a ""mental"" way. The body's senses are finally adequately stimulated.

\- This one is very similar to the first option, but with a twist. Your friend might be in low level pain, but not consciously aware of it (due to a high tolerance like option 1 or just low ability to sense their interior. People with a low sense of their interior do things like miss hunger cues and other bodily signals until they literally pass out). Anyway, dull aches can become much more uncomfortable than sharp pangs of discomfort if they go on long term. It's like when you were a kid and your baby tooth was loose and the whole gum and upper cheek bone were raw and in a dull ache, and you couldn't stop pushing the sharp edge of the tooth into your gum with your tongue, even though that technically ""hurt"" too. But the sharp feeling of momentary jabbing was a short respite from the dull ache, so it also felt ""good"" on top of bad. Pain in these situations (sharp momentary vs dull long term) release endorphins.

\-Your friend has associated pain with other pleasurable sensations. This would probably be what most would call a classic ""masochist"". They mix painful sensations with pleasurable ones for long enough in other situations (sex, eating, etc.), that now it brings about similar psychological states without the addition of the pleasurable sensation and in completely different contexts.

None of it is super worrying. If they have a high tolerance for physical sensation and thus are stimulated enough, they should look into hobbies with high physical involvement (contact sports, extreme activities, or aesthetic pursuits that involved touch and sight like sewing, knitting, or baking). If they're in low level dull pain they should obviously look to improve their health (stretch their muscles, get their back aligned, drink more water to avoid low level headaches, watch their blood sugar/pressure). If they're a masochist that's just a lifestyle choice they can choose to tone down or not."

He was *super* embarrassed and apologized, but I was blown away and asked her what tipped her off that I was raised Catholic lol. She just said ""Oh I can just tell, you just have a look to ya"". 

At the time I was pretty freshly a-religious and had always been pretty ""secularly catholic"" anyway, so I thought of myself as a heathen but apparently I was still *oozing* Catholic school/home vibes. I don't think stuff like that ever completely leaves you."

When a government acts immorally we have a constitution to hold them to, legislation to propose, people to vote out---basically revolution and a threat of political violence/action that is legally and historically understandable to the average person.

On the other hand, when 99% of resources legally belong to 1% of *private* corporations and citizens, and those 1% attempt to buy power, influence the lives of the other 99% of citizens, overpower the checks and balances of the legal set up--- basically *buy* a government/country, a LITERAL if not official oligarchy-- all you hear is ""it's their money, they're a private corporation/citizen, they can do what they want with it, they can change whatever they want for public resources, this is class warfare"" etc.

Real power is resources. Once they're all privatized, the government and the average citizen have influence/power in name and violence only. Because you can't vote on it. You can't point to somewhere in the constitution where they have to do X, Y, or Z. If you point out the detriment of the situation (an oligarchy running a weak government) to the country as a whole it's ""class warfare"", and people will live quite literally enslaved long before they'll ever attack other private citizens---while revolutions against governments, on the other hand, have stronger historical precedence.

tldr- It's a protection against tyranny because violence (revolution and all less severe forms of political action) against an immoral government has a stronger legal and historical basis than such actions against private citizens. People would literally let Jeff Bezos own planet earth and do *whatever* he wishes with it (starve citizens, hike the prices of their medicines, etc.) resource and power wise as long as he got his wealth ""legally"" (which is absurd but it's true), but they'd take action against a government with similar resources and actions long before that."

Anyway, here are some things that helped:

\-  Changing my hair up. Is your haircut encouraging it? I used to have face framing pieces and a part that meant hair did not stay behind my ears easily. This increased how much I messed with my hair a TON. Trying parting your hair in a different way so it lays in a more ""stable"" way when it's down and keep it up or back with a headband at home. The less your hair enters your peripheral vision the better. 

\- Transferring the habit to something else. I just have a lot of physical energy, I know that about myself and it's probably not going to change. So working around it works better for me than trying to just act like I can stop. I started carrying a water bottle around and now it's my ""fidget toy"" thing. It's mine so I can hold it and mess with it as much as I want (as opposed to, like, someone's nice throw pillow), and I also started drinking way more water! Win win. A water bottle is just a suggestion, it can be anything, but seriously--- just do the same shit but with anything but your hair. We're not aiming for perfection here.

\- Ask people that you're with a lot (friends, siblings, cool co workers) to point it out to you when you're doing it. DON'T get annoyed (as much as you'll want to) or they'll stop. Possibly give some ground rules like ""not during a meeting"" or ""don't touch my hand just tell me verbally"" just to keep incidents where it bugs you to a minimum, but for the most part just be a good sport and laugh and then stop when they tell you. It helps A LOT, because it's super mindless for the most part and you can't catch yourself 24/7, at least not at first.

\- Working out. You might already do this, but the more active I am and the harder my workouts, the less nervous energy I have. The effect lasts for days. It just seems to have a really nice \~stabilizing\~ effect on me. I started going to a dance class and it's worked better for this purpose than less high energy work outs like lifting (Lifting is still great, but for other reasons lol).

Vindicta,fpakywy,t3_gcb9uq,1588450318.0,"Styling has a huge affect on how it ages or de-ages you.

I'm 24, have long hair (bottom of shoulder blades) and it can either make me look my age or make me look way younger. If I give myself a blowout and do the whole professional news reporter look, I look way more my age and get less comments when my age comes up (I'm short and have a full cheeks so I get a ton of ""baby face"" comments even though I technically disagree and just think people suck at aging people farther in age from them. Anyway.)

On lazy days though I'll often pull my hair into a half pony or wear a scarf headband and I'll look WAY younger. Especially with my hair brushed and in a scarf headband. It looks very ""fourth grader at private school on school picture day. Will probably pull this headband out at recess"". (Yes this was a roast I got from my friend once).

Some thoughts:

\-Higher pony tails look younger. Hair accessories (barrettes, headbands, sometimes bobbies, etc.) scream young. You can get some really pretty classy ones at a lot of online or offline boutiques (I don't recommend the stuff at drug stores and whatnot. They're functional but can skew too young/cheap when it matters. I've seen some stuff at Target that was decent).

\-Trimming your dead ends and having that thick ""paintbrush"" look at the end of your hair is also HUGE for looking younger. This is why I think a lot of women feel younger at first when they have shorter hair, it has that healthy look at the bottom! Longer hair is more prone to scraggly ends that age the person, but if you can keep them healthy and trimmed then long hair can make you look just as young (if not younger)!.

\-Lastly, long hair doesn't mean no haircut or hairstyle needed! Getting it highlighted, adding layers, getting bangs, etc. all add and change how a hair length works for you. One thing I notice is girls with short hair tend to have a defined cut, or ""style"" it more intentionally than a lot of girls with long hair do. Just growing it out and expecting it to look great is a common thing I see with girls who don't like their hair long, when, if they put half of the style in at longer lengths that they do at shorter lengths, it'd at least be equal. Maybe it's not about *the length*, maybe it's about how you're *wearing that length.*

Honestly though, not every hair length works for everyone. If you think you look best with it on the shorter end, then do it. People usually look best when they finally embrace their own features and don't try to make things that are ""in"" flatter them when they don't. If you have a long face, then long straight hair with a middle part probably *is* aging you. You can switch things up but it might just work best for you to have it short."

What you can do is accept it with grace and not turn every ""drifted apart"" into a ""burned bridge"" for no good reason. Be the person you can talk not to talk to for months, but then when it you do, it feels like you saw them yesterday.

I used to take drifting apart from friends really hard, even when it was for good reasons (there's only 24 hours in a day and we went to universities 10+ hours away from each other, they had a baby, etc.) and assume that there were bad feelings between us since we awkwardly couldn't seem to stay as close. This isn't true and just assuming it is turns it in to self-fulfilling prophecy! You feel like they must like you less now, so you feel awkward and have bad feelings, so they feel awkward and have bad feelings and before you know it it's a whole ""thing"".

It doesn't have to be like that! I let go of that mindset and now I have friends where 99% of our friendship is ""I miss you! Let's catch up soon"" and 1% the random times when we actually make that happen and catch up and it's 100% worth it for that 1% of the time (if you were friends for a reason in the first place, it will be).

Even if the other person doesn't seem interested because you haven't been able to do things you used to, you still don't have to return those bad feelings. You can just explain why, tell them you still love them and still want them in your life even if it's different, and then graciously accept how they take that. I've had a lot of people in the past who took me being farther away or busier badly because I ""wasn't there for them like I was before"" (when we were literally teenagers and had 9 hours a day at school to see each other and talk), and they actually ending up coming back around when they finally got used to it. All just because I left the door open even when they weren't feeling it!

You don't *have* to do that, but if you still have no problem with them (things are just changing), it can't hurt. A lot of people just need to time to process, but push others away before they're done by lashing out against the (inevitable) change.

&#x200B;

>If so, for how long

At least for as long as a state of emergency is declared. If the state can declare an emergency and ask for federal funds, then the citizens are part of that state of emergency and can ask for the unemployment system that exists for exactly these purposes.

&#x200B;

>There are definitely businesses that can resume operation with minimal risk, so if you think people should be able to refuse work and keep unemployment benefits, how do you determine who is eligible to do this and who isn't?

Well, that's exactly what the current application process was supposed to have been measuring. In this specific case, longterm, I think presenting a personal medical history that puts one at risk in a pandemic situation (or the personal medical history and utilities bill of someone who lives with you) should suffice. Individuals at health risk have to be taken into account for unemployment during a pandemic state of emergency, or we're saying only the rich immunocompromised individuals deserve to live. The class divide in deaths would (will) become larger than it already is.

\- Getting eyebrows done. You have a *really* nice base of hairs to work with, the shape is just kind of messy and they could be *slightly* more in sync with each other.  (Obviously this will probably have to wait until quarantine is over wherever you are, or maybe you already do this and it's just been a while for the same reason.)

\- You eye shape would look SO pretty with lashes that fan outwards toward your temples. Lash extensions are the best and they will give you that cat shape if you ask for it. However same deal about quarantine and I know they're expensive af. So if you're not interested in them I'd just recommend curling your middle and outer lashes before putting on a curling mascara to get the same look. With a heavy focus on applying to your outer lashes and getting that slinky ""cat-eye"" shape. 

\- You probably already do this because it's so obvious but your lips are gorg and even a little but of tinted chapstick everyday let alone lipstick and is gonna make you look killer. I'm thinking berry shades, wine shades, and any other colors with a brown base. I have a Chapstick brand chapstick in the shade Hello Bordeaux that I think would look really good on you. You can get it at literally any grocery or drug store and just keep it in your purse.

\- You have nice collar bones, I don't know if you have any restrictions on how you dress for like religious or climate reasons, but I think you'd look really good in lower or wider necks that show off your collar bone and sternum area vs sitting on top of them.

\- The colors you're wearing are great on you. A lot of people can't pull of prints and certainly not bright ones, so you're lucky that you can and stand out.

\- Love the natural hair. The poof is cute. Obviously feel free to switch it up, but if this is your usual, it definitely works on you. Adding a tiny pair of earrings (I'm thinking like tiny gold hoops or a tiny pearl with gold metal?) would really accentuate your hair in this style.

Meanwhile George Carlin gets to call the average person a piece of trash, low IQ idiot 20 times a set and people see him as a wise grandpa character.

Try being facetious. Men will literally just assume you don't know how to spell your own name before they'll assume you're making a joke.

Try having gross out humor. Men do it ""self aware-ly"" but women are just gross and think that's comedy. Also dicks are relatable and comedy for all, but vaginas are for hacks.

Try observational humor. It just sounds like you're gossip-y or judgmental or ""stuck up"" as a woman. People don't want to hear your take on everyday things. You're just some lady--- not interesting to them. The average guy has things to say, but the average ""chick""?  Nah.

They remind of manufactured ones like ""Jenna Jameson"" Alexis Texas"" etc. where it's clear the name is chosen to be catchy or for ""brand"" and showbiz reasons.

They just have a tendency to sound kind of slimy to my ear, like I can imagine their first agent giving them a script with their new ""better"" name on it, and that was that.

They're not all horrible or anything and a lot of people find them cute and catchy so this is clearly just a me thing lol."
