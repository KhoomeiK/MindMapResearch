bipolar,fjcedki,t1_fj9a8d6,1583216928.0,"Oh that's such a hard place to be in... I'm so sorry. I can understand how desperate you must be feeling right now. If it helps... I've been there. You're not some incurable outlier. This happens to people like us sometimes. At age 17, I was begging my doctor for an ECT referral. It took a number of different psychiatrists and 13 different medications before they found the right cocktail for me. Granted it took them 7 years to give me the correct diagnosis. But I'm alive and well and so grateful to have held on through that literal fucking nightmare you're talking about. 

""Treatment resistant"" is a devastating label to have, but it isn't a life sentence. If you'd like a fresh perspective and it's a viable option, it might be worth speaking to another psychiatrist. Something I did that has been incredibly helpful is writing down a list of every pill I was prescribed in chronological order, with the side effects it caused and the reason why I had to discontinue taking it. Then you don't have to remember off the top of your head and your psychiatrist will have something to refer to when they're thinking of options. They love it!

In regards to ECT... That should be a last resort, and any sensible practitioner would say the same, but I get the appeal love, I really do. Think deeply. Is your desire to get shock therapy out of fear that this pattern won't end, or because deep down you know it is the right decision for you? Listen to your gut, not the bullshit lies your mental illness is telling you. 

I think the most valuable thing you can do for yourself at this stage is to ADVOCATE for yourself. I know it can be hard, especially when you're feeling so exhausted, but this might just be what saves your life. Make sure you're a part of the decision-making process every step of the way when it comes to your medication. Don't allow your doctor to dismiss what you're saying. Disagree with them if you know something isn't right and push for what you need. You can probably take a support person along to your appointments to back you up if you think that would be useful. I honestly wish I could do more for you... But just know that things will not always be as hard as they are now. Although it may not seem like it, life can actually be amazing and make all of the pain worth it. I promise. 

Sorry for the essay."
bipolar,fj9a52w,t1_fj9815z,1583138886.0,"Unfortunately the only way of knowing is trying it for yourself. As you can see in the comments, it's been a literal life-saver for so many people, though not everyone responds the same way. Lithium was the worst medication they ever put me on, but I had to jump through that hoop to get where I'm at today - happier and healthier than ever.  Don't give up hope and keep educating yourself. Dig for more options and discuss your concerns with your doctor. We're all here to support you, but this is a leap of faith only you can take. I wish you all the best.

So many other pills out there that have worse side effects and are much harder to manage. It's a patience game unfortunately, getting to that therapeutic equilibrium and waiting for things to settle.

I think each of us within this community is confronted by images and stories of people getting on with their lives, unaffected by BP, and we can't help but compare ourselves to them in a way that completely invalidates our subjective experience of the world. It's easy to label ourselves as weak. I personally face that everyday. But I think it's important to remember that to live with bipolar is extremely difficult and to wake up every day and try again shows an enormous amount of strength. You are not weak. You are a survivor. And you will absolutely make it to where you want to be in life. Sometimes we just have to push harder than others, but that's where your innate strength comes into it.

The media is all bullshit anyway. It's notorious for making people feel like crap about themselves because people only show you what they want you to see. Somebody once phrased it as we compare our back yards to peoples' front yards. 

Maybe try to limit your exposure to things that you find yourself ruminating over. Things will get better. Society is slowly becoming more aware of the fact we don't allow men to feel pain or show emotion, and the stigma surrounding mental health has improved a lot. Never forget how strong you are."
