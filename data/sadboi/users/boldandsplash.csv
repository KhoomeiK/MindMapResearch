Advice,fpyjmy1,t1_fpyffbd,1589005045.0,"Thank you so much, you don‚Äôt know how much this advice means to me. I am honestly surprised myself that I am choosing to do something about my happiness for once. I am gonna try having more free time and see what works for me."
short,fk3ucpl,t1_fk3qzo5,1583846483.0,"Thank you for both comments, I guess what I was looking for was the assertion and what I consider ‚Äúrespect‚Äù that your aunt has. I hate when someone treats me like a child or does something like the elbow on my head thing but I just don‚Äôt know how to respond without being seen as rude.I also don‚Äôt want to seem rude if I start to become a little more firm, it‚Äôs a hard balance. But I will definitely try to exude more confidence (or at least appear to). As for jokes I don‚Äôt really encounter them as much as I used to but I won‚Äôt crack any at my own expense, I agree with you on that."

BPD,f7lfse8,t1_f7gw6cb,1573839515.0,"I did watch a few episodes of Bojack but mostly had it playing in the background while I‚Äôm doing work so I hadn‚Äôt seen this scene. Something so simple, such as that video really does make the most sense. Thank you for the encouragement. I did end up getting through the day and after reaching out to a friend they taught me that even if you‚Äôre having a terrible, shitty day try to have at least 1 win or 1 accomplishment that can make you feel good at the end if the day."
BPD,f7leurx,t1_f7golt6,1573838948.0,"I appreciate this, I was at a low moment and it was way shittier than I‚Äôm normally used to, but you‚Äôre right I was able to take it that day and I‚Äôm feeling a lot better today."
