he closed the polls, a judge denied his request so the polls remained open, then they were deemed a health risk so they were officially shut down.

this whole thing has been such a rollercoaster, to say the least. also every time i feel like i'm not doing the whole 'isolation' thing right, i see packed bars and other public places and then think... 'ok maybe i'm doing this right'. 

i'm sending you and everyone else lots of love <3"

we're an interracial age-gap couple. on paper, while we have a lot in common, we have a lot of major differences as well. but he's easily the love of my life and i couldn't be happier.
