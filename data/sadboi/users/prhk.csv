I know it‚Äôs against the rules but if I didn‚Äôt come here I thought genuinely I wouldn‚Äôt have made it to the end of the week. As dumb as it sounds take ur time, do each day as it comes. Break the day up into different segments and see if you can fill it with activities. A walk  is super important. Get out get fresh air. If u know anyone who lives locally maybe schedule a walk together ( but obviously don‚Äôt walk too close). If you‚Äôd like to chat then we can , just keep trying to find something to look forward to. And as far as work goes you need to speak to them and let them know how u are feeling, explain ur condition and how it‚Äôs affecting you, and then just take it one day at a time"

Adoption,evu9j2m,t1_evt630h,1564789145.0,"I guess I feel different as I was adopted at a later stage. 3 months old is still pretty young so you could have still formed close bonds with ur adoptive parents, idk it‚Äôs kinda weird when you get taken at an older age, I just have always felt like I‚Äôm split as a person, who I was born to be, and who I was raised to be. Its also weird with a name change, that was really tough for me, and I think the barrier that got put up during that first year or so of being adopted hasn‚Äôt fully come down for me yet. Do you have any tips for getting closer to adopted family?"
