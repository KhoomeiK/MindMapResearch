I do understand that it took money to raise and feed and keep these cows alive. I understand that you raise them for the purpose of eating them and it would have been a loss of investment. All i was saying is that there are people who have cows on sanctuaries and dont eat them. These cows live out their natural life expectancy in a happy healthy environment. There are cows who are gentle and playful and get close to humans. Besides why do you get to dub them as useless just because they dont want to get near you? Why cant a cows life be worth more than the meat it produces? I was meerely suggesting that there are other ways of doing things, but you have jumped down my throat and told me i am wrong for not wanting an animal to be killed. Again, I understand the entire reason your family has cows is to kill them, but i just thought i would provide another perspective."

Most of the ""push faced"" dogs are prime examples because they struggle so much to breath. They either need to stop breeding them or outbreed them with a dog like a bull terrier that has a long snout for a few generations to fix the airway issues in the breed. Weiner dogs are also facing more and more back problems as they are bred to be longer and lower. 

Also, just a guess, but we probably have enough homeless/shelter/stray dogs without breeders. Although there is something to be said for breeding a particular dog for a particular purpose in a responsible manner (i.e. working dogs)"

College shouldn't be nearly that expensive anyway, but society has both made it necessary for many professions while simultaneously allowing colleges to become scary expensive without questioning why a college would need to charge the prices they do. People shouldn't be trapped in a career because they went thousands in debt for it as a teen and then later realized it wasnt for them.

unpopularopinion,f4t5edv,t1_f4t3wfp,1571784227.0,"There is one study that showed that the majority of children who transitioned or identified as a different gender still felt that way as adults. 

But, you are right, there isnt a huge body of empirical evidence because this is a relatively new issue. And it's really tough. Because you can maybe have a child transition without the hormones, but once puberty hits they are going to be in huge amounts of distress, and typically become suicidal. So in that scenario you are risking your child's life. On the other hand if you give them hormones so they dont experience the effects of puberty and they later decide they are not trans (a very small percentage) than you need to go back and try to do correctional hormone therapy. Doctors and parents are left with statistics that, as of right now, tell them that if you let a child transition they will most likely not commit suicide and they will still identify as the transitioned gender as adults vs. The small amount of kids who transition and then regret it."
unpopularopinion,f4t44g2,t1_f4t2s75,1571783870.0,"Studies have proven that the vast majority of children who identify as trans still identity that way as an adult. Transitioning, when done after immense medical evaluation, is sometimes the only thing keeping these transgender children from committing suicide. Kids have a strong sense of who they are, gender included. Trans kids will persistently and consistently, for years, to the point that they are in great distress feel that they are in the wrong body because they know what gender their brain is and they know it doesnt align with their biological sex. The same way a child can know from a very young age that they are gay. Transitioning is a very difficult process to get approved as an adult and even more difficult for a child (and even more than that for a pre puberty child). No one is handing out hormones willy-nilly. Transitioning only occurs after incredibly intensive and extensive medical evaluations."

Its idealistic and I'm aware of that, but so were so many things in the past that are completely normal now."
Conservative,ezkhb71,t1_ezkh7g9,1567960271.0,Cant we just try to make things better instead of settling? Like work within the parameters we have right now while advocating for policies that will give future generations a better life?
Conservative,ezkh7jo,t1_ezkh3ve,1567960224.0,But dont you want to live a society where everyone who works hard can make enough to pay their basic expenses?
Conservative,ezkh4xn,t1_ezkgvhp,1567960193.0,"And that's fucked up. I get the why, but it was more a rhetorical question. Society is so screwed because we care more about making sure we have cheap gas than we have a planet to live on."
Conservative,ezkg8j8,t1_ezkg3iu,1567959810.0,"This wasnt his dream job. His dream job requires more school, and therefore more debt. He didn't have a way to go to college without incurring debt so idk what you want him to do about that."
Conservative,ezkg3wt,t1_ezkfx6n,1567959756.0,We need more adults telling kids that there are options other than college.
Conservative,ezkg01z,t1_ezkfdbu,1567959710.0,"His job requires some amount of expertise as the collection has many rare and endangered plants, also constant new diseases and threats due to climate change. 

Dont get me wrong I understand what you are saying. I understand why he cant make more because of the market, but I think its completely stupid. I dont think that this system is as great as people think if it leaves so many hard working people behind. I dont pretend to know what system would be better, I just think that it's not a bad idea to try to reform the system to work for more people. I want this world to be better for more people. Its idealistic and does nothing to help people right now, but it's worth fighting for a better future."
Conservative,ezkfa83,t1_ezkeo3e,1567959410.0,One of the smartest guys I know is a farmer. So I certainly dont believe that.
Conservative,ezkf6s0,t1_ezkedou,1567959368.0,"I think we just differ when it comes to our basic values. This isnt an economic debate as much as it is one about humans. I think humans deserve to have a safe place to live and food on the table. I think they should work hard for other things in life, but I think humans deserve basic dignity and necessities. You, I'm guessing, think humans should have to earn every single thing they have and dont give a fuck about what disadvantages or obstacles they have to overcome to meet basic needs. I dont think in this day and age we need to be that competitive or brutal towards one another."
Conservative,ezkeu5p,t1_ezkelgy,1567959213.0,Not everyone wants to do that though. Not everyone wants to get a job that's in demand. Or everyone tries for that degree and then the market is oversaturated
Conservative,ezkepd9,t1_ezkejb1,1567959159.0,"We seem to have different values. You value money more than time with your child. You could get in a car crash and die tomorrow and then what, your kid never got to know you."
Conservative,ezkek3v,t1_ezkebyj,1567959095.0,"Didnt know that. Thank you for the insight. My argument however, is wouldnt it just be better if people could make money doing what they wanted to do? Shouldn't we try to make that a reality instead of relegating ourselves to jobs we hate in the name of money? I want a better world than the one I live in and I dont think there is anything wrong with that."
Conservative,ezke9sj,t1_ezke7g9,1567958976.0,And what if you suck at those things or hate them? Too bad for you?
