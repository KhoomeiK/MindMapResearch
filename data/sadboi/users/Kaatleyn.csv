Just to let you know you're not alone and it do gets better through the years you will be more occupied with time and it will feel less shit. Stay strong you got this!"

Finland,ezfunqp,t3_cuaxkr,1567884372.0,"Hey guys! I'm f22 i work as a public health nurse in my country (Algeria) since a year now and i always wanted to work or even study nursing again in another country with better salary and work conditions (i can't stress how badly we are treated here especially as a female nurse by both coworkers and society). There is news that we do not require visa anymore to visit Finland so i been searching how can i apply to work as a nurse and i found that i must speak Finnish :/ so i can work in an elderly home or daycare instead (I'm very good with elders and children) not necessarily a hospital so any tips or informations will be appreciated. Thank you!
PS: my English and French are very good if that helps!"
