battd,fa29z6j,t1_fa1g94k,1575779585.0,"Almost all character in the party and all allies

The most priority character is jack with tuxedo (I buy it when there a discount on it) so you can get money easily
Also Jake with tuxedo can make super monkey and tech terror pop any bloon type make it easier to deal with lead or purple bloon

Super monkey with tricket that increase his speed 
Weapon = Dr monkey secret weapon for decrease monkey fan prices to 500$

Also need dark Temple tricket 10x more power than the  regular sun god

Tech terror many as possible
Gumbal (allies)  for slowing down the D.D.T because is fast af when you reach round 50  many people die because of this 

Put tech terror allies on commander Jessie so you can get 2+ tech terror because of Cassie upgrade (scramble)

Don't forget monkey fan for super monkey 

After that just put what ever character you want for more defense like Finn to stun the moab"
