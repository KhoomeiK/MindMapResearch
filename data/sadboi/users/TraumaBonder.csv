For clay, glaze and such [clay king ](http://www.clay-king.com/pottery_wheels/pottery_wheels.html) has the most affordable prices in the US that I’ve found. 

As a start it might be nice to give her the gift of time at a studio that does community kiln firings and glazes she can try out and other people she can ask questions to. If the interest continues to grow you could surprise her with her own equipment down the road.

My husband teaches pottery at a mountain resort. They use [this wheel](http://www.clay-king.com/pottery_wheels/speedball_pottery_wheels/speedball_clay_boss_pottery_wheel.html). Those wheels get a lot of use.

relationship_advice,fcycnxb,t1_fcy4in3,1578078099.0,"Sure! I run a non profit that is focused on decreasing the impact addiction has on kids (specific ages 3-12) and I am a recovering alcoholic myself with a 14 year old and a 3 year old. 

From my experience kids benefit greatly from understanding the Seven Cs. 

I didn’t Cause it. I can’t Cure it. I can’t Control it. I can help Care for myself. I can Communicate my feelings. I can make healthy Choices. I can Celebrate me. 

Other things that are important. 

Give them accurate age appropriate addiction information. Kids are wicked observant. They can tell a difference between a napping parent and one that’s passed out. Caregivers often create more confusion by contributing to the denial. 

Keep explanations accurate but simple. 
Examples. 
Addiction is an illness that affects the brain (Choices, behaviors, moods, etc.). 
Addiction means a person is “stuck” to alcohol or a drug (they think about it all the time and they’ve lost control around it). 
It’s the adults responsibility to get better (it’s a serious disease that requires the help of professionals). 

When kids are educated about addiction it can really help them to separate the parent they love from the disease that hurts. 

Tell them it’s ok to love the person and feel angry at the disease. 

Create opportunities for them to “just be a kid.” 

Make sure they know that they are not alone. There are lots of families with addiction issues. 

Yes, growing up with addiction feels difficult but they can still be ok. Help them to figure out what helps them cope and feel safe. 

Mentoring relationships are awesome. Create access to sober caring adults like teachers, coaches community leaders etc."
relationship_advice,fcwbwyl,t1_fcvezh0,1578021838.0,"The National Association for Children of Addiction (NACoA) has some great resources [Just for Kids section](https://nacoa.org/families/just-4-kids/) that can help you have an age appropriate conversation with your son. 

This [Toolkit for Educators ](https://www.addictionpolicy.org/hubfs/Kit4Teachers_ALt_2018-4.pdf) is a helpful read as well. 

This [workbook](https://books.google.com/books/about/Helping_Children_Affected_by_Parental_Su.html?id=ltTlrQEACAAJ&source=kp_author_description) is also great.

Edit: to add one more resource. [Timbi Talks About Addiction](https://timbitalks.com/) is a children’s book on the topic that is done really well.

Edit 2: more resources. Sesame Street has started a whole category of education/support called [In Communities](https://sesamestreetincommunities.org) that is awesome! They address addiction, foster care, grief, incarceration etc. It’s so great.
