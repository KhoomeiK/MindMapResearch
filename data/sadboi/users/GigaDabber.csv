LearnJapanese,f2o0o5u,t1_f2nyw83,1570321735.0,Yeah i would like to live with a host family and probably for a year.
depression,evjspiq,t1_evjrlyb,1564569046.0,"Please do, I really like it."
depression,evjs3rb,t3_ck6jh2,1564568700.0,I cant offer advice about what to do to find happiness because no one can explain why you are alive but it seems like your chasing a dream which is really unhealthy. If you need to talk my dm’s are open and seriously i mean that. Talking to someone is better that no one even if they are a random internet stranger.
depression,evjrpoe,t3_ck6ijx,1564568480.0,"I don’t know if it will get better, but if you do get better do then do share the secret. Im not sure i have much less to live for but if nothing else i don’t have anything to die for. 

I understand your pain, i really would like to meet more people especially ones that care about me but that seems like a thing that only happens in movies or some shit so if you want a “friend” even if it is just a random internet stranger than my dms are always open."
depression,evjqylj,t3_ck6h4y,1564568042.0,"Nobody can explain why you are alive, thats something you need to do. If you feel that way then try to get your thoughts in the air with the people that seem better without you."
depression,evjqn6m,t3_ck6fy1,1564567880.0,"Good luck, you and i are in the same sinking boat."
depression,evjplfv,t1_evjo1s7,1564567290.0,"Well that does help but i only live with my dad and he and i arent very close so i asked my grandma to talk to him and she said she did but nothing ever came of it. Im at my whits end and im not sure if i will be alive by the time i would like to get my drivers license. And recently my dad gave me my first gun and i cant stop thinking about how easy it would be compared to any way i have thought about in the past. Truth is i cant because im a pussy and don’t t have the balls to end it. But i do think that i a few days i will go see a psychiatrist, i dont know how ill approach the situation but im just terified that my friends will find out because they often express their lack of sympathy for depression and suicidal people. 

Thanks for listening to me rant, I think this did help."
depression,evjnzcq,t3_ck61w2,1564566287.0,"Thats very nice, i hope you do keep writing"
depression,evjnkuy,t1_evjlt43,1564566054.0,Nah im in high school but i do try to present it like i am because people always think its just me being a sad teen boi rather than being a issue(thats part of that whole thing about it feeling like a void im shouting into for help)
depression,evjn1cy,t3_ck5i19,1564565733.0,"The genetic lottery sucks too, im a giant among men and it sticks out. When ever i meet new people its always “wow your giant” and it sucks. Its all im known for in my school and i hate it.

But i share your emotional weakness, and its not something i have managed to fix yet."
depression,evjmrkx,t3_ck5jgf,1564565577.0,"Well if you do get better, id like to know what it fells like. I have already fallen farther than you seeing as how you have someone who cares enough about to to want whats best for you. Do me a favor and try to get help, i have and its like screaming into a void, so consider your self lucky that you didn’t need to seek it out like i did, too bad i failed."
depression,evjmat4,t3_ck5niz,1564565316.0,"As much as id like to tell you to stop that wont mean much coming from an internet stranger but what i can tell you is that nobody can explain why you alive, so you have to do your best to decide for your self. And if you need to talk my dms are open."
depression,evjm0q9,t3_ck5pw9,1564565159.0,"Good luck, i share you pain but for harder reasons to pinpoint. 

Also it seems like talking to your sister and father would be the best route.

Also also cps is always there for you, i do recommend when you leave for uni making an tip about child abuse on your moms part, its likely that your father would get custody in that case and that seems like it would be something that would benefit both him and your sister."
depression,evjlcux,t1_evjk28i,1564564784.0,"No, thank you for sharing your thoughts it helps to keep me from thinking about my own problems."
depression,evjl4w3,t1_evjkgio,1564564658.0,"Thing is that i would like to do that but I feel like every time i try to reach out for help i get ignored or told what i know not to be true like that im sad because im inside all day or never hang out with friends but either way its still hard to admit in the first place, just makes me fell even weaker especially when iv felt that way most of my life being the younger brother and what not."
depression,evjjz6t,t3_ck5qbb,1564563985.0,"That was very good, im listening to mucic right now and i get i got some similar vibes from you work. Please keep writing."
depression,evjjjou,t3_ck5s1a,1564563742.0,"Im alot younger than you but im had depression for a few years now and if you want to stop it you need to take control of your self, deciding on what you want to do and forcing your self to to it is a good start. Its easy to not want to do work but its easiest to think about how it will effect you. Truth told i still have to work in the whole future me is still me thing but im trying hard, even if it is pointless in the grand scheme of things."
depression,evjix6a,t3_ck5tgn,1564563387.0,"Good luck internet stranger, be sure to post your progress in a few weeks for optimal internet points"
depression,evjiss8,t3_ca505i,1564563320.0,"Wow, thats really shitty. I know it can be really hard but try not to take it to heart. I(thankfully) has a more supportive father at the cost of my mother not being there too much and my sister does really well in school and has a ton of friends and im smart enough but my grades are dog shit so i get where your coming from as far as insecurity goes. But i wish i could pin point the source of so much pain like you can, im not sure i even have the right to be depressed compared to you. 

But seriously, i know it can be so incredibly hard but not caring is the best way to make it stop, even if you have to fake it."
depression,evjgltl,t3_cd6d58,1564562084.0,"I used to, some times it would last for like a day or two then id go to school and kinda enjoy talking to my friends but then id know what was coming, the void.

I like to think of it as a kinda cancer where sometimes it can go and never comeback but thats not too common and that alot of the time it comes back with a firmer grip on you. 

But yes, sometimes i do get motivated and want to do something before my mind catches up to me and the dread sets in. I just want to be normal again."
depression,evjg7zj,t3_ccaxvm,1564561866.0,"Jesus christ, im a solid ten years younger than you and yet experience the same mindless existence"
depression,evjg0ye,t3_ch5k91,1564561749.0,"I dont know why, but you experiencing the same pain helps me out its hard not to feel alone so thanks for sharing your thoughts, they do help. And if you do want to die than just consider it for a very long time, thats what stops most people."
depression,evjfko5,t3_cd0hjp,1564561492.0,"I dont really know how it feels, but i do experience the always exhausted bit. I think faking happiness is just really exhausting.

It nearly the end of summer vacation and i haven’t left my house many times, haven visited my friends irl at all and i get the feeling those i connect with online don’t like me. Im not sure i have much to live for at this point other than for my family who iv grow distant from, I hope my life gets better soon."
