mantids,fqwxgn1,t1_fqw8ru1,1589720516.0,"We've never had any problem with this one molting. We had an orchid mantis that died because of a bad molt but the ghost mantis would molt overnight. I found her laying on the floor of her enclosure a couple months ago, thought she was dying so I fed her some honey and stuck her back upside down. The next morning she had molted. So it seems to me they do it rather easily. But we do mist the enclosure daily."

Terraria,fqd8h4v,t1_fqd16om,1589283195.0,It's been a few weeks since I've played but I was stuck on brain of cthulhu. I've already beat the eye of cthulhu but not king slime. Also base building was kind of slowing me down. I've watched some videos on it but I have ocd so it's been slow going with minimal progress. My tactic so far has been to just start mining and see what I find. That's how I summoned brain of cthulhu without even knowing what I was doing. I haven't given up I'm just taking a short break.

Bluegrass,fq0fikn,t1_fpy5b4d,1589031082.0,No unfortunately that's not it. Just yesterday I was searching youtube for it and I think I listened to every song with the word jenny in it and none of them were it.
Bluegrass,fq0f92u,t1_fpxtimc,1589030986.0,He recorded it off the radio. He had dozens of tapes filled with bluegrass spanning over a decade. His house was way out in the middle of nowhere on 4 acres that looked like something off of American pickers. He had speakers wired up all around the outside of the house and at night he would play those tapes while we got hammered on home made wine sitting around a fire. The neighbors a mile down the road said they would drink beer in their driveway and listen to the bluegrass echoing through the woods. I used to turn it up really loud when I would go mushroom hunting behind the house. I know you didn't ask for all that but I just felt like saying it.
Bluegrass,fpxojch,t1_fpx83lh,1588986447.0,The first time I heard it was probably 15 years ago. It's been awhile since I've heard it but I wanna say it sounds similar to King Wilkie or maybe Dan Tyminski. I would say it's from the 80's or 90's.
Bluegrass,fpx40bp,t3_fx6o9i,1588975234.0,"Billy Strings is definitely a beast. I especially love the work he does with Don Julin. That being said, I've been into King Wilkie here lately. IIIrd Tyme Out, Blue Highway, Earl Scruggs, Ralph Stanley and Ralph Stanley 2. There's a band from my hometown called The Wes Miller Band that are great. Also the All American Bluegrass Band. Definitely check them out. And we can't forget Doc Watson. I love bluegrass. Dan Tyminski, Rose Maddox!!! I know this technically is Folk music but Tim Eriksen is awesome. The Ephemeral Stringband. I could go on all day."

I'm just kidding Halo is a good game. I like Playstation better because I've been playing on them since the first one came out. I really think that's what it boils down to, which one did your parents buy when you were a kid. It's all about loyalty and nostalgia. On the other hand I'm currently saving money to build a gaming pc.... for the sole purpose of playing Minecraft with RTX. If you get a Playstation I highly recommend The Last Of Us remastered. Great story and the way it feels when the character throws a punch is amazing."

It's easy for people who still have jobs, likely with overtime to virtue signal. We don't need lockdown, we just need to be more careful. If everyone wore masks and gloves and businesses ramped up sanitation it would have the same or better effect. Walmart is open, gas stations are open and plenty of other places that likely have increased traffic since other businesses are closed. This lockdown is a knee jerk reaction that is having little effect other than further polarizing the country and corralling everyone into Walmart to fight over toilet paper and spread the virus."
