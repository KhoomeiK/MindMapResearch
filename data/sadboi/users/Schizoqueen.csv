antidepressants,fkw4tbr,t3_fl1oiw,1584583473.0,"Hey, I get it. Taking that first step into the medicated world is scary. You feel ashamed to admit that you need help. It’s not a bad thing to be turned off by medication.

What you have to understand is that the feeling of emptiness you have is depression. A physiological condition of the brain. That’s how most depression appears in people - a void. It’s not all crying and sadness. Most of the time, it’s just emptiness. 

You’ll probably hear this comparison a lot. What if you were a diabetic and needed insulin because your body doesn’t produce it. Would you refuse that chemical because it’s not your “official” chemical? Meds are designed to give us what we don’t have or take away something we have too much of. Usually that’s serotonin, norepinephrine, or dopamine.

 Give the meds a shot. Let them do what they’re designed to do.

antidepressants,fkvx4j7,t3_fl0hc1,1584578579.0,"I haven’t switched from Paxil to Prozac. But I had switched from lexapro to Prozac.
It was an okay switch. Didn’t really feel much, other than happier. Prozac works well for me."
antidepressants,fkvjtpp,t3_fky44s,1584570658.0,"1 - they are usually prescribed by a psychiatrist or a medical doctor/nurse practitioner. They listen to you explain how you feel, they can run tests, get to know you, then deem whether or not you need a med.

2 - they can only see what’s in your system if they drug test you. And that only really works with drugs that people can check for (like illicit drugs or schedule 1 drugs). Generally, they won’t test for prescribed meds unless they’re an abuse risk."
antidepressants,fkv3926,t3_fkvcqo,1584561111.0,I would agree that being home now would be a great time to text out new meds. Give it a shot!
mentalhealth,fkuyq23,t3_fkuhbi,1584558643.0,"Hi! A known side effect of some SSRIs is psychical anxiety. Like teeth chattering and leg pain/cramps. This might go away once you get used to the new med. If not, you can always try another. Don’t feel too disheartened, there’s a plethora of options available to you."
