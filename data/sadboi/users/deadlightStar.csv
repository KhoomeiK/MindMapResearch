**Leiannie** is an a OC, mother of all three children. She doesn't retain the title of Queen/King, even in game once you marry your spouse. They aren't considered a King or Queen. So just like Queen Elizabeth, her husband has the title Prince Consort.

**Logan**, of course is the elder brother, who becomes King after their father/mother's death. He continued the legecy of being a just King until ||He went to Aurora|| . Where in game he become the antagonist.

**Lorraine** was gonna be the Hero of the story. But she was more in my mind; political, spoiled and would be a harsh Queen. In fact she is evil in my game play but everyone survived. She is ruthless and swift like her elder brother Logan, and both have a close bond as they grew up together side by side.

**Lark** is the now the main Hero. He is the younger brother of King Logan and Princess Lorraine. He's the rebellious type and free spirited boy who is was pulled revolution of saving his kingdom from his tyrannical brother Logan's rule. Harsh as it maybe, Lark along with his sister see the damages done to the people of Albion. Lark continue his anime protagonist ways up until he is king and realized the harsh reality difference between a politician and a idealist."

I was also worried about the structure of the poem itself. When I write poems like,  it seems more suited in paragraph form than poetry.

The base idea of the poem itself, is that not all mountains are safe to climb. Especially, when they have a significant place, meaning or value which other thought best to be left alone than disturbe. However, there are those people who tread onward, even if some people lost their lives, whether it be accident or attacks from wildlife.

Betrayal. I(9) made a new friend who was new to the school in my grade, and who I welcome her into my social circle. I realize later on, she was pushing me away and more a less taking my place. My best friends started to avoid me, ignored me. At first I didn't feel a thing, as I had other social circles. But she was taking my closet friends away from me. I decided at a young age, that it wasn't going to stop me from having fun at recess, and I didn't care about being alone as I know for a fact I am the ""weird kid"". My friends came back to me as they said didn't really like the lies she was telling them about me. Still I took my new friend back, enjoyed a sleepover and then she moved. She also stole $5 from my room which sucked.

Fallout. (14) All my closet friends became their worst enemies. All my other friends started to hate and gossip on one another. My social circle started to shrink and it was hard maintaining friendship with people who hated each other. From then on, I decided to be alone. I still talk to a few people here and there, say hello. But those bridge are worn and no longer safe to cross.

As of right now, I still have one best friend who I am still able to talk too. Even if it been years since we last spoke in person. She is a rough spot but my plan has always been the same. When I am able to find and afford my own place. I'm abducting her. We made a pact and she's my first best friend since childhood. When I leave, she's coming with.

**Story**

Once upon a time, a little girl grew up blind and mute. Her father loves her through and through. So, he prayed each day, and every night. ""Save my daughter from her plight!""

Suddenly, a miracle be blessed!
The little girl had new eyes and a tongue. When she looked upon her father.

""*Papa, where's your head gone?*"" She asked. ""*I don't know your face papa. Can you get a new head? I will chose which head will be yours.*""

The headless father loves his little girl so. He soon grabbed his axe from the shed. And off he went looking for a new head.

Left to right, he swinged his axe. Bringing back a new head, so his little girl can chose which one she liked instead.

""*No blondes,?"" she said, ""(Brunettes or fiery heads.*""

The little girl ponders and wonder which head she'll like sitting on her father's neck.

""*Find me a head with long black hair*."" She requested.

The headless father went and search, and found what his daughter requested.

""This will do!"" Said the little girl triumphantly.

So, the headless father placed the head with long black hair upon his neck, but it fell off and rolled on the floor instead.

""*Oh, no. Your head is gone. This won't do.*"" Cried out the little girl. She then ask her father to find a new head.

""*Find me a head with long black hair. And a silly mustache that has curls on each end.*"" She requested.

The headless father went and search, and found what his daughter requested. But the same thing happen again. The head rolled onto the floor instead, of staying on his neck.

""*Find me a head with long black hair. And a silly mustache that has curls on each end. And a mighty beard, true like vikings. Please, papa. Please.*"" She begged.

The headless father went and search, and swinged with his bloody axe. He found a head matching his daughter's request but it also rolled off his neck.


A pill was building on the floor near his daughter's bed.


His daughter gotten really sad and depress. Her father tried, and tried to find the right head.

Until one day, the little girl looked outside. She saw the Mightly King riding by. Seated upon his giant and noble steed, looking tall and divine.

She went to her headless father with a gleam in her eyes.

""*I love how the king looks, papa. He has long black hair, a mustache and bread. His eyes are kind and his smile sincere. Take his head and it make yours!*"" She said in glee.

Rumors began to spread far and wide. A headless demon was taking heads. Left to right.

Beware, beware for it had a particular taste. It seeked men who had long black hair, a mustache and beard.

The king was worried, and his people cower in fear. He sent many men to find this creature. To put an end, to its reign of terror.

One quiet evening, while the king was alone. The headless father's found his way into the castle. He raiser his axe high in the air.

Off with his head!

Clean from his neck.

The headless father came home that night and in his hand was the King's royal head.

His daughter jumps in hooray, and dances with such joy. The time has come and she eagerly awaits to see her father wear his new head.

Once her father tried to wear the king's head.

It fell from her father's neck, with a **smack**! It rolled to the pile of heads that adored his daughter's floor.

""**NO! I WANTED YOU TO WEAR THE KING'S HEAD!**"" Cried out the little girl.

The headless father's daughter moped in her bed, caressing the dead King's head. Her father continues to chop off heads, and a collection soon hanged over his baby girl's bed.
