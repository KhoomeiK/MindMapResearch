I am a very defensive person. If someone goes off on me in a game I can’t help but to attempt to defend myself. But there is a difference between defending one self and attacking someone.

I’m a logical thinker, so if I don’t agree with their statement I will express that I do not agree with them, and if they continue throwing punches, well, I don’t tend to go out like a bitch unfortunately.

Unfortunately, this takes time, and the ult can easily be wasted because of this. If Sanc had a small ‘pull’ which pulled allies towards its dropped location when activated, it would let them know the direction of the Sanctification as well as give them incentive on moving to it.

However, this would most likely never happen as it’s already powerful in application when people use it correctly (team mates included), but I could also see players getting angry that you “messed up their skillshot” when trying to save an ally."

I have multiple broken teeth, I have a phobia of driving, major PTSD and Paranoia attacks, am overweight (but built like a football player) and balding.

My Fiancé loves me for who I am, the person I am, rather than despise me for what my mental illness has done to me. She is smarter than she thinks she is, she is so much more beautiful than she gives herself credit for, and she understands my illness as she goes through some of its symptoms as well.

People tend to go off medication when Manic because they have the capability to believe that they have cured Bipolar, which we all know is not true. We have no control over the rushing thoughts and what we believe when manic...

You start projects when manic and give up on them when the depression hits, it’s normal, but with medication you can level these issues out, but you will need to find a working medication first.

When my first manic episode hit I was convinced the voice in my head was God and that I was Jesus Christ, and that Jesus must have saw what I had seen... 

Now, looking back on it, I believe the case has more to do with us fooling ourselves into believing we are connected with the universe rather than actually feeling that way.

To explain in a bit more detail, such as you making dumb and risky decisions in full blown mania that you normally would never do is due to you genuinely believing that is what you want and that is what is going to make you happy.

Our mind tricks itself into believing these things, and when I am manic and my mind is racing a million miles an hour, it’s difficult to not firmly believe in something when there is so much evidence to support the theory. So the theory becomes reality, at least in my head. I feel like Sherlock Holmes, being able to decipher anything that comes across my path, as if I am some sort of genius with the computing power that I hold.

bipolar,f3p364i,t3_dh9ges,1571040839.0,"Part of me wishes to say yes but another part of me is skeptical from what you’ve written.

Rapid cycling is a thing, but what you are expressing is that it happens multiple times within the same day, which I am pretty sure rapid cycling is more of a per-week deal than multiple times in a day, but I don’t think I have rapid cycling (I am still trying to pinpoint my own ‘switches’) so maybe someone else can chime in on this.

 If you are bipolar, rather than switching between the two constantly like you are expressing, you could also be having a mixed episode which is not only difficult to express to someone how it feels like, it’s sometimes even difficult to comprehend what is even going on with yourself. This is when most Bipolar people commit suicide because they have the energy to execute a plan while feeling depressed at the same time and is a very dangerous mind set to be in for obvious reasons.

With this next part I honestly do not mean to offend you in any sort of way, but some people diagnose themselves with depression because they aren’t feeling well or feeling “sad” for an extended period of time when not completely understanding what depression even is.

Here’s the thing, you need to make sure that if you are going to use Marijuana to “soften the blows” of Bipolar, that you are using the right strain. One of the strains (Sativa I believe it’s called) can trigger your Mania while the other strain does not. CBD can be a great alternative as long as you are getting the legit stuff.

On a more personal level, I do think you should try to get a working medication. It can be difficult to keep pursuing it when month after month every new medication doesn’t work, and you feel as if it is a waste of time... but eventually as you do more research and become more educated about your condition, you will start seeing the signs of your condition yourself, in turn makes you realize how bad off you actually are.

So just ask yourself the question, are you willing to keep drowning yourself in dread and darkness, and allowing your mind to be out of your control because you might not be a tiny bit less creative?"

bipolar,f3p1y9k,t3_dhm0cp,1571038870.0,"I would rather someone leave me ASAP before a depressive crash rather than during one when I need their support.

I usually bring up the topic as: “Hey, I have a weird question for you but roll with me, how much do you know about Bipolar Disorder?”

This gives you an idea of their education in regards to it. You can clear up any misconceptions and educate them about it before telling them you have the illness.

It kind of leans them into it as well since they start to wonder why you are bringing all of this up and why you are so educated about the subject, which makes you telling them less of a shock."

bipolar,f3jjei0,t1_f3jg4ia,1570953666.0,"Nike was suppose to be that exact laid back job you are speaking of. When I was working full time it was partially hell. My lungs hurt from talking so much, it was just call after call for the whole shift.

When I moved to part time I moved to the night shift and it was much more relaxed. Sometimes up to 20-30 minutes in between calls, being able to talk with my neighbors and browse reddit.

Eventually management started getting down on me about me 2 cigarette breaks I would take to “reset” myself. I switched to vape for this reason but it bit me in the ass...

The whole mania spending spree of spending hundreds of dollars on mobile games one week caught me with nothing but the highest dosage of vape juice, but I would constantly smoke it as if it was the lowest dosage. It’s all that I had as I had ran out of the low dosage, and I bought the high dosage to deal with the lack of being able to take smoke breaks anymore... I would go into the bathroom for a couple of ‘hits’ to reset myself and start over again, almost trying to trick my brain that it was the start of the shift and that I had less time to work.

Unfortunately mixing the overdosing of nicotine (which made me feel deathly ill) and the massive amounts of marijuana I was smoking, (I would get home and smoke until it was time for bed to dull myself), it sent me into the manic episode I spoke of in the OP.

With all of this being said, my illness has not only gotten worse since then, but the lack of having anything to help control it, the constant abuse coming from my family... I do not think I can hold a job in any sorts of means, no matter how dire the situation I am facing is.

According to my fiancé, one night I was crying in my sleep begging her not to force me to get a job. Even on a subconscious level I do not feel able...

Bipolar isn’t even the only thing I suffer from, sadly, as I also have major PTSD and Paranoia attacks.

Even though Nike wasn’t the perfect job per say (having an asshole tell you how worthless you are and how much of a fuck up you are isn’t exactly the best thing for depression), even having said perfect job wouldn’t help... as I’ve said somewhere in here, my dream job of being a video game designer is even out of my reach, because I simply can’t bring myself to apply to the task. I either lose interest, fall into the shadows of depression, or simply make it out as being too difficult of a task.

I really do feel so damn sorry for every one of us that has Bipolar Disorder, I wouldn’t even wish this illness on my Parents for a week knowing what they would have to go through, even if it meant them finally understanding my suffering."
bipolar,f3j8lui,t1_f3j7oed,1570948679.0,"I’m a gamer... but I sold my computer to go live homeless with my fiancé... for her own safety though I came back so she could have a place to live.

I sold some old N64 games to get a switch and Mario Maker 2 to try and get that itch, and I have an iPhone 8+ so I’m able to download any free games that pop up (Call of Duty has been nice) but it is still no where near the amount of... I guess you could say immersion for me to escape reality. The things I have help but only in a minor sense...

I tried also to get Super Smash Ultimate for the switch but ran out of games to sell, and the card shop I sold my MTG cards at ripped me off but I had no choice to accept their offer (Had a card worth $150 alone and they gave me $70 for my entire collection)

I am grateful enough to have the switch, but it has also come with its own problems such as a monthly subscription that I obviously can’t afford mixed with the thoughts that I could have used said money for nicotine instead which I am almost out of...

Everything just seems to be falling apart."
bipolar,f3j4jme,t1_f3j3g5i,1570946836.0,"A mini fridge would just be an expensive solution to burrow myself even further into my room to be honest... it’s difficult enough to find the courage to even shower, use the bathroom, or cook food when either of them are home...

Some days they will be in a good mood and suddenly call my name so I think they just have a question or something so I let my guard down only for them to start attacking me...

A mini fridge will only hurt me more than it would help unfortunately.

As for online jobs I have searched, but it is difficult to keep the search going when you don’t find a single one to apply to after days and days of searching... I eventually stop caring and the depression just takes over.

As one of my replies here states, I can’t even work towards my dream job. I’ve tried again and again to get back into programming to create my own game, but the enormous amount of darkness that eventually lumes over me turns me to not care for a thing in this world. The only thing that seems to be able to escape that darkness is my fiancé."

I can receive counseling from the place where I see my doctor, but needless to say the counseling hasn’t been... helpful."
bipolar,f3j2lw7,t1_f3iz8co,1570945966.0,"My doctor told me he would not sign off on disability unless I was marijuana free for 6 months. :/ It’s the only medication that I know helps reduce the pain of the depression and when I have my parents constantly abusing me it’s difficult not to go to it for a crutch...

I tried CBD and it was working for a while but I’ve ran out a long time ago, and I’m sure that doctor wouldn’t like that idea, he didn’t seem to know much about Marijuana and Bipolar to be honest...

I have a new doctor I’m seeing soon and I will discuss this with them in a couple of days... 

Yes, I am diagnosed with Bipolar I. After my manic break at Nike, believing I was Jesus Christ and that Aliens have enslaved our planet, I went in voluntarily but had some incidents so they locked me up in a mental ward for a week after diagnosing me...

Most of my friends have abandoned me after learning about this... even some family have stopped speaking to me. The only person on this planet that I know cares is my Fiance... and I want to be able to live with her in peace of mind, regardless of my illness.

I will attempt to do more research in regards to SSI and SSDI and talk with my Fiance over it and ask for assistance... 

The sad thing about all of this is that I can’t even do my dream job of programming and creating video games... I’ve pushed myself over and over again to learn new programming languages, designing a game, setting the pieces up only to give up due to either loss of interest, the pressure of depression, or simply becoming overwhelmed with the idea of failing.

I fucking hate my illness, it has prevented me from doing so much in life and has held me back... and my parents just look at me as a disappointment, an asshole, and a thief rather than someone who is suffering on a daily basis and constantly screaming for help.

My life is the epitome of shit... it could technically be worse off for me. My fiancé could leave me or I could be homeless... but at this point I just expect more shit to fall in front of me."
