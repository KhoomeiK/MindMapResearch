Anxiety,fcy6tg9,t3_ej90dr,1578075626.0,"I know this sounds novel coming from a Reddit post, but you have to carve out large chunks of time away from any form of electronic media - remove the FB app/twitter app/reddit app/news apps from your phone, disable wifi on your computer when you walk away so you have to physically make a decision to turn it on when you use it, and stop exposing yourself to triggers of your stress as much as you can. Our culture is such that human beings have constant exposure to triggering electronic stimulation, and for people with anxiety disorders, we have to learn how to manage our exposure even more than other people. 

I used to work in an environment where there was constant news footage on the tv's by the elevators. During a period where the news programing that was being aired was giving me severe anxiety, I realized that there were no tv moniters by the stairwell so I started taking the stairs instead. No tvs and less people, and within a couple weeks I stopped feeling as panicked about the tvs in public spaces - and then one day I realized that the tvs made me less nervous because I had a way to avoid them. (Was it a miraculous anti-anxiety cure that allowed me to quit my meds and frolic through fields of flowers? No. Did it help me be less agitated when I showed up to meetings with other departments? Yes.)   
Also, as silly as it sounds, when your brain starts spinning on these thoughts, tell them to stop. You can't help when the intrusive thoughts start, that is just how anxiety disorders work, but you can do your best to shorten their duration. Even if it is something as simple as ""Stop"" or ""FUCK OFF BRAIN"" can force your brain to literally change this pattern of thinking before it turns into a full blown anxiety/panic attack.   
If you literally cannot stop these thoughts because your anxiety disorder has become unmanageable, seek professional help (again). 

I hope these tidbits help."

A trick I use when I don't have the capacity to take a call is letting it go to vm and setting aside a time later to return the call. Being able to plan a time so I can prepare for a conversation or step away from my desk is super helpful for me. I try not to go more than 24 hrs without a reply because I also know that the longer I ignore it, the more time I have to get weird and parinoid.
