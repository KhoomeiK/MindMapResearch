NoFap,fr0r3sn,t3_glu75a,1589804581.0,This reminds me of a comment on a certain porn site where he said basically the exact same thing. People made a meme about it but it’s actually kinda sad.
DoesAnybodyElse,fr0qvob,t3_gltuib,1589804404.0,"Yeah, one thing that is very sad to see is people in a group, all sitting down just staring at their phones. Like ffs talk to each other and have fun. I kinda wish phones only could call or text someone. Then people wouldn’t be distracted by all the other stuff."
AskMen,fr0qd6c,t3_glpls9,1589804003.0,"People telling me what to do. For example cleaning my roomor whatever. I was gonna do it without anyone telling me to do it, but if someone then tells me to do it, then i no longer want to do it."
AskMen,fr0q5p5,t3_glpls9,1589803839.0,"If someone is eating and they got some food on their finger. Then when they lick it off they make like a loud kissing sound or whatever. My mom does this very often and she knows i hate it, i tell her all the time. But she always forgets, which makes it even worse. I’ve told her over 50 times and still does she forget. Drives me nuts. Sometimes i’ve went full on rage-mode because of it."

depression,fpt13m9,t3_gf18hm,1588883039.0,"same. I was basically together with this perfect fucking girl, who i felt really liked me for who i am. And i found her to be pure and real, unlike other girls. Like we both knew we were going to get together, but i made a small mistake. And after that, our relationship just kept getting worse and worse because i was dumb, said dumb things and so on (we go to the same school btw). Now, i have fucked up all my chances with that girl and i am left, completely fucking alone. My life is complete bullshit now and i can't stop thinking about how i should've done things instead."
depression,fppchov,t3_gencre,1588799784.0,"Depression is romanticizing, also why it's so goddamn dangerous. It makes you feel special, and unique. It's like you don't want to be like everyone else, and the thing sticking out is your sadness. So you stick to that. I can relate but i still do not feel this way. 

My life was about to be fucking great, then i made a small mistake with this girl. And the after that, it made me realize how fucking miserable my life is (long story). And that i really don't have any real friends at all.

Even tho i'm the guy telling the most jokes, laughing all the time, but still also the one who fucking cries himself to sleep everynight because i hate my life. And i'm scared. 

I don't want to keep feeling this, i want to go back, and fix the past. Then my life would've been great. I know that in life, things shouldn't be viewed as good or bad, because you don't know the future. But sometimes it's just so fucking hard. So hard that i can't seem to do it. But maybe that's situational, idk. I could go on forever about this, and that makes me realize i need to talk to someone... 

Sorry if i got off-track, needed to vent a bit.."
