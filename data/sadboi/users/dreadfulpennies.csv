If you're okay with time traveling, time travel to 15 days in the future. Set the time for 12-3 PM so that your villagers are more likely to all be outside.

From there, skip forward a day until you see a bubble over someone's head. If it's over the wrong villager's head, don't interact with them. Just bump the time forward one day, save, and exit. The bubble will switch to someone else's head. Rinse and repeat until it's over the head of your target.

Using that method, I haven't found that talking to them or ignoring them makes much of a difference. HOWEVER, it's a lot harder to get your most recent villager to move out. So if you have space, let another villager move in before trying to kick out Pietro.

If someone comes into your campsite, you can force them to choose the specific villager you want to replace. If they name a villager you don't want to replace IMMEDIATELY exit the game. Go out to the home screen and close it. If the game saves, you're locked into that same villager. Rinse and repeat until they give you the name you want. 

Campers have a max chance of showing up six days or more after the last camper showed up. Once a camper shows up, it resets. So you can skip forward 6 days then a day at a time until you get a new camper."

He's not responsible for people threatening Nan's brother. (AFAIK, Nin hasn't come forward saying anyone threatened her family.) If someone did threaten Nan's brother that was one individual who the guy who created the video wasn't shy about explicitly and thoroughly expressing disgust towards.

And even if you believe both sides are doing damage, why are you joining in and encouraging reprehensible behavior? It's okay to emotionally blackmail and call someone a coward for looking after their mental health?  That's okay because ""the other side is just as bad ? """
DissociaDID,fn542lb,t1_fn4vgqr,1586655435.0,"Okay, I know I said I wasn't going to argue here, but I just got back to the computer and actually read this comment.

He deleted the videos because Nin and Nan supporters were pouring in, telling him their blood would be on his hands if something happened. It was disgusting behavior. Absolutely disgusting to try and emotionally blackmail someone like that.

It's not cowardly to step away from people harassing you. As someone who values mental health advocacy, you should know that. Is this the peace and kindness you say Nin told you to show to others? I was in that comment section for the influx of child porn apologists saying he was responsible for Nin's suicide attempt and for people questioning Nan. Nin's life is her responsibility. What Nan did in her past is her responsibility. To try and pin it on anyone else is despicable."
DissociaDID,fn4uewy,t1_fn4tntl,1586649196.0,"I've been homeless and suicidal and in and out of psychiatric hospitals. I didn't sell child porn to get by.

You're replying to a bunch of different comments I've written. I'm not going to argue. There's really nothing I can say to change your mind. You've got the facts. You can look at them or you can ignore them. This whole situation is undoubtedly very upsetting and stressful for you, and I'm sorry if you're having a hard time right now."
OutOfTheLoop,fn4tble,t1_fn4stgu,1586648515.0,I've looked into it extensively. It's something that's been on my mind a lot lately. I stand by what I said.
OutOfTheLoop,fn4t38k,t1_fn4s2o9,1586648370.0,"Nin says they don't advocate hate while engaging in rather hateful behavior themselves. (Manipulative wordings, liking hateful comments fans make silencing detractors, more or less saying that Tatiana brought the hate down on herself and it wasn't any of her business.) The online DID community is toxic. Anyone with a dissenting opinion is singled out and bullied into silence. It's not all Nin, but she is absolutely contributing to that culture.

A fetish is always sexual. By definition, it is *always* sexual. She called the images she created porn. She knew what that word was. It wasn't a mistake. I know it's rough when your favs are problematic, but if you've looked through all the archived evidence, it's hard to ignore. I really find it troubling that people would rather take Nan's word rather than look at the facts for themselves. When someone does something wrong, they don't get to decide whether they're guilty or not. That's not how that should work."
OutOfTheLoop,fn4ritx,t1_fn4qu1m,1586647410.0,The facts are cherry-picked and I often find the advice problematic. The videos are aesthetically pleasing and present alters as friends that make it so that you're not alone in your trauma. I feel like that misleads a lot of younger or more impressionable viewers to believe that DID is something desirable to have.
DissociaDID,fn4qhk2,t1_fn4q5zi,1586646784.0,"They weren't only drawing for commissions. A lot of it was drawn for themselves. They literally say that they, ""consider themselves fortunate they can draw their own porn."" Some were commissions most were not. And, even so, that doesn't excuse anything. ""I was paid to draw underage pornography."" isn't an excuse. If anything, it's slightly worse. They were profiting off of it."
DissociaDID,fn49vkq,t1_fn48w0h,1586637018.0,"I've posted links to their porn blog and forum activity down below. Big trigger warning, but I would rather people who are just deciding to take Nan's word on this look at the evidence for themselves.

A fetish is always sexual by definition. Nan is making excuses and outright lying. They were in their twenties. Their blog and online activity was explicit. They absolutely knew what porn was."
DissociaDID,fn38xzl,t1_fn2xbtd,1586615656.0,"I don't know why this is downvoted. That is absolutely what people have been doing, and it's disgusting."

HUGE TRIGGER WARNING FOR UNDERAGE FETISH ART AND NSFW CONTENT

[Nan's personal blog.](https://archive.li/https://outoftissues.blogspot.com/*)

[Nan's activity on a fetish forum](https://archive.vn/www.sneezefetishforum.com)"
OutOfTheLoop,fn1tjr5,t1_fn1ngtf,1586569767.0,"There's a lot. To keep it brief and just list a few:

* the idea that ""if you think you're faking, you're not faking""
* cherry-picking research and ignoring the many, many studies that don't support her facts and statistics.
* giving viewers advice on how to get a diagnosis of DID.
* irresponsible use of social media, including eating disorder related weight loss numbers and breaking the news of a suicide attempt to a vulnerable audience.
* lots of talk about repressed memories without any sort of caveat about the dangers of inducing false memories.
* Making a dissociative disorder look more glamorous than it really is. Subjective, but a lot of younger viewers have ""realized"" they have DID because of her and her skewed statistics, insisting it's a fairly common disorder.

From what I've seen, personally, I don't think her channel has been particularly helpful at any point in time. The mental health advice and information she provides make me very uncomfortable."
ac_newhorizons,fn1shly,t1_fn0qas6,1586569065.0,"If you still have the doubles of the lantern and the pile, I'd pay just about anything for them. I'm so tired of popping these balloons."
OutOfTheLoop,fmwh2fs,t1_fmw6cml,1586446453.0,"Big, big warning here. NSFW and features some underage characters. There's more of it, but here are a few archival links. Nan went back and deleted and privated this stuff once it was found:

[Some of their activity on a sneeze fetish forum](https://archive.vn/www.sneezefetishforum.com)where they talk about germ catching to make themselves sick (collecting used tissues), being aroused by inducing sneezes where people can see them doing it, and being aroused by people fretting over them while they're sick-- which throws a very disturbing light onto the sneezing compilation videos on their main channel (before they deleted everything) and the many posts to their social media about getting sick."
OutOfTheLoop,fmugwb4,t1_fmubpog,1586391174.0,"Not the person you're replying to and I can't create a top level comment in a succinct way and without being biased, but...

There's a lot to it.

DissociaDID's (Nin's) fans are lashing out looking for someone to blame. They want to blame Trisha, but it's really doubtful that's the cause.

Nin was on an Anthony Padilla video that got a lot of attention. (That's how I found her.) This put her in the public eye as a mental health advocate, and that raised a lot of red flags for people. IMO, her mental health advice was downright dangerous and her videos were sensationalist and putting out more stigma than they helped erase.

Her fans were very defensive toward criticism. Someone made a troll channel. The fans thought Trisha made the troll channel and attacked her. Nin didn't do much to calm them down, resulting in a mess of drama between feuding fans.

People started looking into her past and finding some stuff that raised questions. Her fiance, Nan, is another big DID Youtuber. People found a whole bunch of underage sneezing fetish porn they had drawn. As of today, Nan has vanished from social media.

Given Nin's history, people were predicting she would threaten suicide. Which, even if there's no intentional or unintentional manipulation in that, is still a wildly inappropriate thing for a mental health advocate and educator to post to her social media to an underage fanbase that's already very worked up. Now it's absolute chaos. Fans attacking critics, fans attacking fans over dissenting opinions on the underage fetish porn and how Nin has been using her platform lately. Then you just have everyone else ready to go after Trisha and...

I don't even know how to tl;dr. It's a mess."
DissociaDID,fmlr60d,t1_fmjgjfb,1586191709.0,"I agree that no one should be forced to reveal their trauma. However, I have a hard time ignoring Nin's childhood trauma based on how often she brings it up. She's adamant that DID only occurs due to childhood trauma, but her parents are, by her own admission, very supportive. Sometimes she alludes to how carefree her childhood was, sometimes she implies that her parents and home were abusive without stating as much directly. Her first alter, apparently, emerged at three. So the repeated, ritualized childhood trauma had to have happened before that. But her concerned parents don't know what might have happened. Neither does Chloe, though she mentions flashbacks.

&#x200B;

I understand that she has mentioned later trauma. I'm happy to take her word for it. That's no one's business but her own. The childhood trauma is also none of my business, but it doesn't seem like there's any business to find. Nin assumes she must have childhood trauma because that's how DID is formed.

And I would be able to let that go if she wasn't so proud and outspoken about being a childhood abuse survivor.

As someone who did survive childhood abuse, I find content like this offensive and the sort of thing that minimizes abuse:

[The comments](https://imgur.com/a/VizoWY7)

Assuming you were abused as a child based on nothing other than the fact that your disorder requires that you were, then using it for sympathy and speaking for victims is NOT okay."
DissociaDID,fmlop2x,t1_fmhzxv0,1586190412.0,"As an outsider looking in on the DID community, I have to say that this hasn't been very beneficial to me as far as education and reducing stigma goes.

The subject of mental health is incredibly important to me. When I stumbled upon DissociaDID's channel, I fell down a rabbit hole watching her videos and reading study after study on DID.

As someone with PTSD and a subsequent dissociative disorder, I was inclined to believe that DID was legit. But that was before I was introduced to DissociaDID and the community at large. I have more doubts now. A LOT more doubts.

I also have genuine concerns about Nin's young fanbase. Searching ""switch caught on camera"" brings me so many results of kids emulating what she does. Paired with her assertion in videos that, ""If you think you're faking, you're probably not"" and other potentially dangerous mental health advice... I genuinely worry that it hurts more than it helps.

I'm also extremely uncomfortable with the way she encourages fans to draw and ship her alters. It feeds into making the disorder look desirable and seems terribly unhealthy in general.

While I don't necessarily think that she's knowingly faking, I don't personally believe she has DID. At the very least, I don't feel like she has the expertise to responsibly use the platform and attention she's been given."
DIDCringe,flxy5gu,t1_flxwij6,1585592041.0,"I don't know why I keep replying to these threads. There are only so many ways I can word the same answers to the same questions. I dunno if it's a problem with reading comprehension or a fundamental lack of empathy or what.

You're not going to change my mind on this.  And you're repeatedly asking questions about things I've tried to explain. This isn't a debate that's doing anyone any good. Unfortunate, but it is what it is. Godspeed, friend."
DIDCringe,flxvnf7,t1_flxthah,1585590691.0,"New alters can emerge later in life. No one said an alter can't be named Mark. It can affect ""Markiplier"" or anyone because that's scary. If someone came to me and said they had an alter based on me, that would scare me. It doesn't matter if you don't think they would be or don't think they should be because ""that's not what a factive is."" They aren't obligated to go out, educate themselves, and come to terms with you using them as a template and face claim.

The idea that they should just be okay with it because you don't think it should bother them  is inconsiderate and selfish. You can't help having an alter, but you can help how you choose to introduce that alter to the world at large.

Since you're circling back around the my initial post, I already addressed that:

> ""Right to exist"" is a poor choice of words chosen in reaction to people  feeling entitled to greet the world and be validated as a factive with a  face claim. 

Which I stand by. I don't think I have anything else to add without repeating myself either. Apparently, people think their trauma entitles them to introduce themselves to the world using a non-consenting individual's name, image, and personality as a template."
