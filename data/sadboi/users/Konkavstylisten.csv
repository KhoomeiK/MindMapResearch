The whole: ""My friends or these or those people have gone this far and i am currently experiencing the worst period of my life, physicly, mentaly, financialy.""

Reading your comment makes me think that when i go through all of this shit maybe i can ""turn this bad experience"" into something good right? 

Taking advices from other people is a big deal and something i am trying to be better at. I am currently trying one of these: ""Talk to a psychiatrist online for a small fee"" apps. Don't know if it's a international thing but to me it feels like i have a huge problem opening up to people ""eye to eye"". But online, in a more or less anonymous setting makes it easier. I mean, my friends would obviously listen to me telling them about my depressions for example, but examples such as suicide attempts are harder and can give a real life consequence in the relationship. 

I am turning 31 in two weeks. I got seriously burnt out when i turned 25, got diagnosed with ADD and got a faulty diagnosis of (Aspergers, which was later debunked). But it took to me going into a deep financial crisis, due to manic-periods and lack of balance control. For me to get a proper Bipolar diagnosis. Somewhat, they did not go into details (Type 1, Type 2 and so on). But i at least got some answers. It feels like my prime-youth years were wasted due to mental issues."

It is correct i need some amounts of insulin for the rest of my life.
But how i take care of myself DO MATTER. As i said in the post. But that is beside the point. You are missing my point that i am trying to state.

Many here are using diabetes as a metaphor for horrible diseases that just can't be ""wished away"". As one that are suffering from both ADD and Diabetes Type 1 i try to state the irony in that ADHD is far worse than the actuality that most Type 1 Diabetics face every day."
