lexapro,fmw59v6,t3_fxgp50,1586439835.0,"I work at a grocery store so last week I had a dream that I punched a customer in the face because she stole some coins from my register and my manager was like ‚Äúreally Lanasgrl?‚Äù And I left and a second later I was back at work and I had the same customer that I hit and she pretended to give the coins to a charity to make me feel bad on purpose and make her look like the victim. 
The next few days at work (practically non-stop all week), I was in a very, very pissed off mood."

No, I just want to be f*cking paid more for it, and to be given masks and gloves. A $2 raise is NOT enough."

I don‚Äôt know much abt Valium but it‚Äôs possible that you‚Äôre having Valium withdrawals as well. Invest in a therapist if you have the means, or talk to a trusted friend/adult/coworker etc. If you don‚Äôt have either of those, writing your thoughts in a journal usually helps me personally. Try to give yourself things to look forward to, such as saving money to treat yourself in the future. Hang in there, you‚Äôll get through this."
offmychest,fhs9c9s,t3_f4lnz8,1581856701.0,"Lesbian (F 19) and I feel the same way! The last woman I dated wasn‚Äôt even gay and just used me for attention, it ruined me. Most of my friends are guys because of the same reason. There is a popular lesbian dating app and to pick your gender it says ‚Äúwomxn‚Äù instead of woman.. like what if I don‚Äôt align with that? I completely given up on dating because there is a lack of genuine lesbians/bisexuals in my area. Also where are the lesbian spaces.."
offmychest,ff4qz1k,t3_erhisj,1579570330.0,This. After I broke up with my ex gf (for treating me like shit not even for cheating) she literally just said ‚Äúoh btw I talked to other girls behind your back‚Äù with no remorse whatsoever. And then when I told everyone what she did she told me I was being pathetic and immature for reacting.. wtf. I have every right to be upset after being disrespected like that sorry. Some people were born without a proper conscience I guess.
lonely,f4yncps,t3_dm6nsl,1571880556.0,"Me too. I always anticipated an exciting college life like everyone else at 4 year schools but since I go to a community college, everyone tends to stick with their friends from high school instead of reaching out and making new friends. Sure, I would have some cool conversations with other students in my classes but will never venture outside school. 
I just want to be able to actually hang out with like-minded people my age is that so hard to ask? Some people make it look too damn easy. I also have bad confidence because I‚Äôm a bit awkward and shy and I feel some people might be weirded out by that. But you‚Äôre not alone on that feeling, it does feel competitive in a way because there‚Äôs so many interesting people in one place and you really have to stand out to be noticed in college."

NarcissisticAbuse,ezzmir7,t3_d2xnw0,1568289441.0,"I actually had a similar dilemma 6 months ago when I was still with my nex. We were supposed to go to a big music festival (paid for everything already including non-refundable plane,event & bus tickets) I eventually decided to not go despite losing all that money but I knew there was no way I was going to be spending all that time with her. The main issue was telling the nex bc she put up a fight and treated me worse but I went no contact right after that. I think you should do whatever feels right but if you‚Äôre worried about being with him all that time then it sounds like it would be best to pass on that trip for now."

lonely,ewtkigt,t3_cpyql6,1565747306.0,"Literally same. Doesn‚Äôt make it easier making friends when I recently got out of an abusive relationship and I feel like I can‚Äôt trust anyone. I sense a red flag then distance myself from them completely. I‚Äôve realized that most of my (2) friends don‚Äôt reach out to me first and I always have to make the plans. I‚Äôm also the one who always drives instead of taking turns. I bend over backwards for people who don‚Äôt reciprocate my effort and it really makes me feel unwanted, which makes me not want to be friends with them anymore.  Now I‚Äôm pretty much down to one friend who doesn‚Äôt even live in my state and barely manages to respond to my texts. It‚Äôs frustrating as hell, but we have to keep pushing on and start respecting ourselves more so we can find the friends we deserve."

This past year I had no choice but to cut off close friends from high school bc I was tired of getting hurt and taken advantage of no matter how lonely I would be without them in my life. I ended up dumping all my feelings onto the very first person I encountered with in a long time. I told him everything that happened, stuff that was very personal to me and I knew how annoying and pathetic I must have sounded but I just couldn‚Äôt stop."
AskReddit,eq9hypr,t3_bxr2vk,1559907411.0,"- borrowing money (& takes months for them to pay back)

- cheats on you and when you ask them abt it they deny it and call you crazy

- lies about their life experiences

-gives you silent treatment for no reason

-start arguments for no reason simply bc they‚Äôre bored

-take advantage of your kindness

-keep in touch w their exes just Incase their current relationship doesn‚Äôt work out

-passive aggressive

-verbal abuse

- doing this all while pretending to really care abt your wellbeing and messing with your head to make you think they love you but they could hurt you and feel zero remorse. 

I know this from personal experience, unfortunately."
