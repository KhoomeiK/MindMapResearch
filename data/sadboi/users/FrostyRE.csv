Ever since I very much enjoy working on my cars and recently just bought a Pontiac G6 for real cheap. Needed a power steering rack so just learned how to do that with the help of my step dad.

Dealing with drunks, drug addicts, people with severe mental problems, and people hating you just because they see you as a wanna be cop for not letting them smoke right in front of the hospital doors. 

In my 6 months so far, the worst I had to deal with was someone in the mental health unit. He was calm all day, then when a nurse came in to give him his meds (pill form) and smacked the cup out of her hand and pusher her so hard she fell on her ass. So right away they call me up. When I get there, he has a fucking wooden chair in his hand that he his swinging at anybody that comes near him. What makes it even worse is I was the only guard on duty that day as my co worker was sick. So he sees me, we lock eyes, he says ""what the fuck do you wa-"" and before he could finish speaking I did a full sprint and double legged his ass to the floor (thank you high school wrestling) I got punched in the face quite the few times but I had top control so they weren't the most painful. After a few minutes he was huffing and puffing and basically just gave up. He told me sorry and he took his meds while I stood by. Once those kicked in about an hour later, he passed out and the nurses said they'd call me back up if they need me again. All this for $11.80/hour ($0.25 more than minimum wage) and a black eye.

Never had another problem with him since and he's still at the hospital. We give each other a nod if we pass by in the hallway."

Now if you REALLY want to save money while having a reliable car that is super cheap to own, you should look at getting a 2nd hand 96-99 Toyota Tercel. I bought mine for $1000 (CAD) The little 1.5L engine doesn't pack much in terms of power but it is VERY durable. Not only that, it's easy on gas. I've had my Tercel for over 2 years now and it still has a lot of the original parts on it. The only things I've had to do was: 1. Starter 2. Brake Pads and Rotors 3. Fix an exhaust leak 4. The regular fluid changes. Other than that, this car has been fantastic for me. I drive it 140km a day (70km to work 1 way) and only have to refill the tank every 4 or 5 days depending on how easy I drive it. It's even more fuel efficient if you get the 5 speed manual transmission like myself. Plus it makes it a blast to drive. You don't get any fancy features aside from cruise control (only on CE models I believe. like mine) and your stereo system is really outdated. But throw in an aftermarket deck, put on some black seat covers, some nice rims, and you've got yourself a fun, reliable mode of transportation!

Anyways that's just my 2 cents. In the end choose something you want not something others are telling you that you should want. Best of luck in your search!"

I've had a couple crappy jobs before this new one I'm soon starting.

1)Dishwasher (first job)

2)Dishwasher/Prep Cook

3)Security Guard

All of these were very easy jobs to apply for. 1st job was from when I was 17 (like you) and I'm almost 20 now and finishing my 2 weeks at this job (#3). Next is working at a warehouse shipping/receiving plane parts. I'll make 2.27/hour more than what I make working security. 

Took me 3 years of working to finally find something good. Take the crap jobs to start. It might not be what you want, but try to make the most of your experiences. Make some money while you can. Start good relationships with your co workers. Make plans for after work so you have something to look forward to when you get off. Finally, build your resume with those crappy jobs as it'll be a HUGE help with finding something good in the future. When you are finally done with the crappy jobs, be sure not to burn any bridges with your former employers so you can use them as a reference. Gonna be hard to apply for these better jobs if you don't any former employers that will vouch for you being a good worker.
