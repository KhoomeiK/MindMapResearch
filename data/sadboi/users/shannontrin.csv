dogs,fpdtd1a,t3_gct9b8,1588533831.0,"I’m really sorry to hear of your loss- especially under the circumstances :-(


Honestly if you find the answer to this please let me know... the love of/for a pup is one of the purest there is... the void that takes their place is often hard to navigate... currently struggling with this myself :-("
mentalillness,fpbrxy5,t3_gcfuv0,1588477217.0,Thanks for sharing :-) That is an accomplishment to be proud of!!
mentalhealth,fpbanoq,t1_fpb7ko5,1588465728.0,"I’m always on my phone bc it’s an escape of mine- I find it so much easier to interact with strangers on the internet than to message my own friends back 


I think I’m finally in a position to want to start holding myself accountable- baby steps ..."
mentalhealth,fpb5p2a,t3_gcdan4,1588462651.0,"I feel the same- I just shut down to the point where I don’t have enough energy or heck the motivation to respond... I hate that I do this and that others get hurt by my actions but not enough to make myself change. I have lost many friendships bc I just “don’t care”... 


people don’t understand that it is more than just a text... Its all the energy required to put up that front, to compose a message, to care... 

Don’t get me wrong some days are better than most, but when it gets bad it gets bad :("
